They are scattered throughout British Burma, from Mergui in the south to beyond Taung-ngu in the extreme north, and from the Salw\u00edn (Salween) Hills in the east to as far as Arakan on the west. They are found principally in Taung-ngu, Shwe-gyin, Amherst, Tavoy, Mergui, Bassein, and Hanthawadi Districts. Among the race themselves the word Karen (Burmese, \u2018aboriginal\u2019) is not recognised as a national appellation, and is only known to them as being their name in Burmese. They are not the aboriginal inhabitants of the country known as Burma. They point to forest-clad battlements of dilapidated fortifications, and declare that \u2018these cities of our jungles were in ruins when we came here; this country is not our own. We came from the north, where we were independent of the Burmese, and the Siamese, and the Talaings.\u2019\n\nFrom their traditions, it would seem that there have been three great migrations of the Karens from the central plateau. They say: \u2018The Karens and Chinese in two companies, as elder and younger brothers (the Karens the elder), wandered together from the West. The journey was long, and continued for a long time. The two companies were finally separated, as the younger brother went in advance of the other. The company of the elder brother ceased to follow, and founded cities and a kingdom of their own, but were conquered and scattered by others who came after from the same quarter from which they themselves came.\u2019 They refer to their ancestors having crossed the River of Running Sand (the great Mongolian desert of Gobi), \u2018that\nfearful trackless region where the sands rolled before the wind like the waves of the sea.' Again, from Northern China, perhaps about the second century A.D., when they settled somewhere near Ava. And, lastly, about the fifth or sixth century A.D., when they came southward and spread over the mountains between the Irawadi, the Salwin, and the Meinam, as far south as the seaboard. Here they have since remained, a wild uncivilised race of mountaineers, broken up into many petty clans and communities, jealous of and ceaselessly at war with each other. Surrounded by Buddhist nations, they have retained their primitive nature-worship, leavened with singular traces of a higher but forgotten faith.\n\nOne feature that distinguishes the Karens from the peoples around them is a tradition of their former possession of a more theistic religion than the present worship of the spirits of nature, and the embodiment of that religion in writings now lost. They are said to have traditions of the creation and fall of man, coinciding minutely with the Scriptural account, even preserving the names of Adam and Eve, of the Deluge, the dispersion of nations, and the difference of languages. They have a pure conception of a Supreme Being, whom they name Y'wah, and who is perfect, good, omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient. These alleged traditions undoubtedly point to some former communication with Christian missionaries. The belief in the immortality of the soul and a future state, which is common to most of the Karen tribes, is entirely rejected by others, who hold that the life of man, as of animals, ends with death.\n\nThe doctrine of the tripartite nature of man\u2014namely, his body, soul, and spirit\u2014is elaborately developed among them. The human spirit or ka-l\u00e1 exists, before the man is born, in some mysterious region, whence it is sent forth by God; 'it comes into the world with him, it remains with him until death, and, for aught that appears to the contrary, is immortal.' Not only man has this ka-l\u00e1, but animals, trees, plants, as well as spears, knives, arrows, stones, have their separate and individual ka-l\u00e1. When the ka-l\u00e1 is absent the object dies, or is destroyed, or does not come into existence. The human soul or heart is thah, and to it alone is attributed praise or blame. Besides his ka-l\u00e1, every man has another principle or spirit attendant on him called tso (power or influence), which may be defined as reason.\n\nThe Karen tradition respecting their lost books is that formerly God gave them books written with one-sided letters on skins containing His laws. These books the Karens carelessly lost, and then the knowledge of God and how to worship Him departed from them, except as a misty tradition among their ancient wise men. They do not any longer profess to worship the Father, God, and Creator Y'wah; they\nknow not how to serve Him. As the whole world is filled with demons and spiritual beings, more or less malevolent and powerful, they must devote themselves to the never-ending task of propitiating these spirits. They have no images, nor, properly speaking, any visible object of devotion. The worship paid to the 'N\u00e1ts,' or Spirits of Nature, is not one of love or even veneration, but simply of fear and propitiation. The Karen addresses these spirits with prayers and propitiatory offerings, to entreat them not to afflict him with sickness or other bodily calamity; or to remove those afflictions which he believes have come from them. The Karen thus lives in an atmosphere of intense spiritualism\u2014the air, the water, the woods around him teem with invisible, intangible, and generally malicious beings.\n\nThe Karen people are composed of three distinct tribes, the Sgau, the Pwo, and the Bghai; differing somewhat in their customs and traditions, and considerably in their language. Each clan is subdivided into septs or clans, which also differ from each other in some of their customs and idioms, and particularly in their dress. There are three clans of Sgau, five of the Pwo, and six of the Bghai; but these only include the tribes and sub-tribes whose representatives are found in British Burma. In the Shan districts beyond the British frontier are the Ranlang, the Reng-ban, the Reng-tsaik, and others.\n\nThe Sgau tribe is found from Mergui to Prome and Taung-ngu. On the east, a few have wandered over the watershed which separates the Meinam from the Salw\u00edn, to the eastward of Zimme in Siam. On the west, some of them have migrated into Arakan. They are foul feeders. No animal food comes amiss with them; they eat vermin and reptiles, such as rats, lizards, and snakes. They eat none of the monkey tribe save the black monkey (Semnopithecus obscurus), which is considered a great delicacy. The Pwo tribe is found scattered along the coast from Mergui, up to and within the deltas of the Salw\u00edn, Sittaung (Tsit-taung), and Irawadi rivers. They prefer the banks of the creeks for their houses. They are very muscular, powerful men, and make capital boatmen. The Bghai tribe inhabits the elevated plateau of KAREN-NI (q.v.).\n\nOf the Karens, those who live in the plains are strongly built, with large limbs; while the mountaineers are a weaker people, with smaller muscles and limbs. The men are about five feet five inches in height, and the women not more than four feet nine. In general, they are fairer than the Burmese, and the obliquity of the eyes and the cast of the countenance more nearly approach the Chinese. 'The head is pyramidal, wider across the cheek-bones than across the temples, and the bridge of the nose rises slightly above the face.' The houses vary in shape, size, and construction. Some tribes live in comparatively\npermanent houses, some in temporary sheds; some have separate structures for each family, others one for the whole village.\n\nThe villages of those who live among the hills are generally built in the middle of the jungle, and remote from any frequented track. The houses are of the poorest description; all the inhabitants in a village form really one large family, being all connected by blood or marriage; no stranger can settle among them. Many large villages have never seen a European face. Some few even manage to keep the Burmese tax-gatherer outside by sending their revenue to him. This life of freedom and independence is dearer to them than all the luxuries of the plains. The only domestic animals they have are fowls, dogs, and pigs; dogs are eaten by the Bghai only.\n\nThe marriage tie is held in greater reverence than among the Burmans. Divorce is only permitted in cases of adultery; and after payment of the fine settled by the elders, the offending party is at liberty to marry. Polygamy is not permitted, but is practised by some of those who live near the Burmese. Children are generally betrothed by their parents in infancy, and heavy damages are exacted for the non-fulfilment of this obligation. A damsel thus jilted is entitled to a kyi-zi for her head, another for her body, and a \u2018gong\u2019 to hide the shame of her face. A kyi-zi is an enormous metal drum with only one head, and varies in value from three up to one hundred pounds, and is the standard of wealth among the Karens, as herds and flocks are among pastoral nations.\n\nInfanticide is rarely practised, but sometimes if a mother dies, her infant is buried with her. Some of the tribes bury and some burn their dead; but those who resort to cremation state that it is comparatively a new practice, and that formerly they buried their dead. The Karens are nominally bound to temperance by their religion; but the highest pleasure they can conceive is to get drunk. The price of blood is still demanded. Slavery is common among all the tribes, and a clan of the Bghai often sell their relations. The belief in witchcraft is strong.\n\nTheir language is monosyllabic, and has consequently no inflexions, but is amply provided with suffixes and affixes; resembling the Chinese in possessing six tones besides the simple root. The American Baptist missionaries have reduced their language to writing, adopting a modification of the Burmese alphabet to express it.\n\nAt present the Karens of British Burma can be divided into two classes\u2014those who have permanently settled in the plains and betaken themselves to a regular system of agriculture, and those who still remain in their primitive freedom on the hills. Although the former still to a great extent retain their peculiar dress and language, they have been greatly influenced by the Burmans both in manners and in religion. Most of them now profess Buddhism.\nThe wild denizens of the hills and forests have preserved their ancient customs; except that blood-feuds, robbing, killing, and kidnapping have to a great extent ceased. Their life is unsettled and ever changing. To raise their scanty crops, the virgin forests on the steep slopes of the hills are cleared and burnt. But the excessive rainfall washes the soil off the surface, so that only one crop can be raised on the same spot until it has again become overgrown with jungle, and a fresh deposit of earth has formed. In two or three years all the cultivable patches near a large village become exhausted. The whole community then moves off to new localities, perhaps 30 or 40 miles away, since they may not trespass on what is regarded as the range of another village.\n\nEvery year the dense forest must be attacked, and with infinite labour large trees six feet in girth, and 100 to 150 feet in height, felled, cut up, and burnt with the undergrowth, to clear the ground. The crop usually consists of rice, maize, esculent roots of different kinds, betel vines, and various pot herbs, with a small patch of cotton to supply the housewife's loom. The Karen has to guard his patch of cultivation against elephants, deer, hogs, and birds. But there is one enemy against whom all his precautions are useless when it appears in any number\u2014the hill rat. Fortunately the visitations of this pest occur only at long intervals of forty or fifty years; the rats generally settle on a tract of country for two or three years in succession, till they have reduced it to a desert. The Karens during such visitations kill and salt the rats by thousands and eat them. From 1870 to 1874 the hill country east of the Sittaung river was devastated by one of these rat-invasions, and \u00a310,000 was expended by the British Government in relieving the Karen tribe.\n\nThe customs, traditions, and beliefs that have been mentioned are not found universally among all the tribes in the same degree. According to the tradition of the most civilised Karens, they have retrograded from a higher state. There are certainly some branches who seem to have reached the extreme of barbarous debasement. In one part of the Province between the Sittaung river and Karen-ni is situated a mass of precipitous mountains. Here the Karens may be found in the wildest and most degraded state; knowing no arts, not even how to weave their own garments, and too lazy or proud to cultivate more than absolute necessity compels them.\n\nIn 1857, at the time of the Sepoy Mutiny in India, there arose among the Karens a leader, named Meng-Laung, a mysterious character, who affected to be an incarnation of the deity. He proclaimed that he had appeared on earth to drive the British out of Burma and to establish a Karen dynasty in Pegu. Many of the simple-minded Karens believed in his divine mission. They joined him in large numbers from the\nremotest villages. The rising was promptly suppressed in Bassein District, but assumed a threatening character in Martaban and the interior. After giving considerable trouble to the authorities, it was eventually put down; but excitement prevailed for months afterwards among the Hill Karens. Every attempt to capture the leader proved fruitless. At last he made his escape from British territory, and found a refuge in the remote region of Eastern Karen-ni.\n\nWhen the members of the American Baptist Mission first came to the Karens in 1828 with a Book out of which they taught words strangely agreeing with the Karen tradition, they were respectfully listened to. The results of missionary labours among the Karens have been excellent. The cessation of blood-feuds, and the peaceable way in which the various tribes are living together, is more due to the influence of the missionaries than to measures adopted by the British Government. The missionaries have a well-graded system of schools, both in the jungles and in the towns. In 1881, the American Baptist Mission had among the Karens 16 foreign ordained and 91 native ordained agents, 19 foreign lay agents (of whom 18 were females), 252 native preachers, 173 native male and 41 native female teachers. The native Karen Christians in 1871 numbered 35,876; in 1881, their numbers were estimated at about 64,200. The American Baptist Mission in 1881 maintained 3 theological and training schools, with 58 pupils; 20 Anglo-vernacular schools, with 457 pupils; and 230 vernacular schools, with 6073 pupils.\n\nBesides the American Baptist Mission, there is a 'Home Mission' among the Karens. No returns are available for 1881, but in 1871 this mission included 5500 native Christians. And the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel established a Karen mission in 1872, with 3 foreign ordained and 5 native ordained agents. In 1881, the mission consisted of 53 native preachers, 3 native teachers, 4800 native Christians. The mission maintains 2 vernacular schools, with 82 pupils in 1881. In the Salwin Hill Tracts the Karens are taking to police work, nearly 200 having joined the force there. But they will not serve for long; as soon as they make enough money wherewith to meet marriage expenses, they withdraw\u2014without permission, if there is any delay in answering their request to be allowed to retire.\n\nThe Census of 1881 returned the Karens in British Burma at 518,294, namely, 264,288 males and 254,006 females. Owing to the imperfect entries in the Census schedules, it was not found practicable to classify the Karens by tribes and clans. The Census returns the native converts of the American Baptist Mission at 55,322, almost entirely Karens.\n\nA pleasing feature in connection with the Karen Baptist Mission is the increasing tendency to self-support among the communities. In\n1881, the Karens themselves contributed no less than \u00a36066 towards the maintenance of the Baptist Mission churches and schools. At the Decennial Missionary Conference held in Calcutta in December 1882, one of the Baptist missionaries stated that among the Karens 'in Bassein District, there was not a single pastor receiving foreign pay; not a single school that was not supporting its own teacher.'\n\n**Kareng-le-chin.**\u2014Village in Taung-ngu (Toungoo) District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. Situated 5 miles south of the boundary of Upper Burma and 7 miles west of the Sittaung river. Frontier police post.\n\n**Karen-n\u00ed.**\u2014An elevated plateau, extending from the eastern slope of the Paung-laung range, immediately joining British Burma on the north-east, to the Salw\u00edn river on the east. It consists chiefly of high table-land, about 3000 to 4000 feet above the level of the sea; is well cultivated, and in parts very fertile. Inhabited by the Red Karens (Karen-n\u00ed), a clan of the Bghai tribe; so named by the Burmese from the colour of the bright red turban they wear. The red Karens originally acknowledged the supremacy of one chieftain; but within the last hundred years they have split into two separate tribes, Western and Eastern Karen-n\u00eds. The western tribe has been always friendly disposed towards the British Government, and has given every assistance in its power in keeping peace on the frontier, and in opening out trade. The eastern tribe has kept aloof from communication with the British, and lately acknowledged the suzerainty of the Burmese Government.\n\nIn 1864, the old chief of Western Karen-n\u00ed requested the British Government to undertake the government and protection of his country. He was informed in reply, that while the Government placed a high value on the friendship of the Karens, it had no desire to extend its frontier in the direction of their country. On the death of the old chief in 1869, this request was renewed by his two sons, on the ground that the Burmese and the Eastern Karen-n\u00eds were encroaching on their territory; and that, unless helped, they would have to succumb. The British again declined to annex the territory of the western tribe, but made representations to the Burmese Government. Notwithstanding a formal disclaimer on the part of the Burmese king to any claim to authority over the Western Karen-n\u00eds, his continued menaces and assumptions of authority over the Karen-n\u00ed country obliged the British Government in 1875 to exact an effective guarantee. A survey party was therefore despatched under the orders of the Government of India, to survey and lay down a boundary between Western Karen-n\u00ed and Native Burma. This boundary has been formally recognised by all parties, and the independence of Western Karen-n\u00ed secured.\n\n**Karhal.**\u2014Central southern talisil of M\u00e1inpuri District, North-\nWestern Provinces, comprising the pargan\u00e1s of Karhal and Barn\u00e1hal; traversed by the Et\u00e1wah branch of the Ganges Canal. Area, 221 square miles, of which 110 are returned as cultivated, 34 square miles as cultivable, and 76 square miles as waste and barren. Population (1872) 88,850; (1881) 100,031, namely, males 55,720, and females 44,311. Hindus number 93,445; Muhammadans, 5534; Jains, 1049; and \u2018others,\u2019 3. Land revenue, \u00a317,384; total Government revenue, \u00a319,473; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a326,836. The tahsil contains 1 criminal court and 3 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 31 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 286.\n\nKarhal.\u2014Town in M\u00e1inp\u00far\u00ed District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Karhal tahsil, situated on the Et\u00e1wah and M\u00e1inp\u00far\u00ed road, in lat. 27\u00b0 0' 5\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 58' 45\" E. The principal street winds off at right angles to the road and forms the b\u00e1z\u00e1r. The shops here are poor, and the houses mean; but at the back of the b\u00e1z\u00e1r some of the private dwellings are substantial and well-built. Irregular narrow lanes connect these houses with the b\u00e1z\u00e1r, and serve as imperfect drains during the rainy season. Population (1872) 5574; (1881) 7885, namely, Hindus, 4630; Muhammadans, 2420; Jains, 832; Christian, 1; \u2018others,\u2019 2. Area of town site, 85 acres. A brisk local trade is carried on in gh\u00ed, cotton, and indigo; and for police and conservancy purposes a small house-tax is levied. The principal buildings are the tahsil, police station, sard\u00e1\u00ed or native inn, and school. The town is the residence of a Sayyid family of considerable note and influence.\n\nKarharb\u00e1ri.\u2014Coal-field in Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh District, Bengal, situated between 24\u00b0 10' and 24\u00b0 14' N. lat, and between 86\u00b0 16' and 86\u00b0 23' E. long. Area, 11 square miles, of which 8\u00bd miles are coal-bearing. The probable amount of available fuel (excluding small seams and those of inferior quality, such as could not be worked at a profit, also making allowance for waste, etc.) is estimated at an aggregate of 70 million tons.\n\nThe existence of the field was first brought to notice in 1848, and some coal was raised at the outcrop of several of the seams to test their excellence. Systematic working was introduced in 1851 by Mr. Inman, and in 1855 by Messrs. Ward & Company, railway contractors at Monghyr. In 1856\u201357, the property held by this firm at Kuldih\u00e1 and R\u00e1mnad\u00ed was transferred to the Bengal Coal Company, who now own 6 other mining villages in addition. In 1862, the company discontinued their workings till 1868, since which time they have been vigorously prosecuted. The East Indian Railway Company commenced working the Karharb\u00e1ri mine in 1858, and a large quantity of coal was annually carted away to Lakhisar\u00e1i. In 1862, work was suspended chiefly on account of difficulties of carriage. In 1870, a branch line\nof the East Indian Railway was constructed to their mines at Karharb\u00e1ri and Sr\u00edr\u00e1mpur, and working has been carried on uninterruptedly ever since. The total output up to June 1875 amounted to nearly 350,000 tons. At Karharb\u00e1ri, the railway company hold 2465 acres on a lease from Government for 82 years, at a yearly rent of \u00a35072. At Sr\u00edr\u00e1mpur, they have 1408 acres on a perpetual lease from the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and pay an annual rent of \u00a3494. The company work the coal for their own consumption, and not for sale. The out-turn from the Karharb\u00e1ri and Sr\u00edr\u00e1mpur mines in 1883 was 208,000 tons. The miners are chiefly Bhuiy\u00e1s, B\u00e1ur\u00eds, and Sant\u00e1ls.\n\nThe quality of the coal of the Karharb\u00e1ri field has been tested by several assays of the mineral from different localities. The best seams disclose from 4\u00b72 and 4\u00b78 to 6\u00b76 per cent. of ash; from 71\u00b78 to 73\u00b71 and 68\u00b76 per cent. of fixed carbon; and from 24 to 22\u00b71 and 24\u00b78 per cent. of volatile matter, respectively. The inferior seams show from 26\u00b75 to 34 and 39 per cent. of ash; from 57\u00b71 to 50\u00b79 and 48\u00b72 per cent. of carbon; and from 16\u00b74 to 15\u00b71 and 12\u00b76 per cent. of volatile matter. The specimens which gave the best results were obtained from localities in the east of the field; the inferior quality being obtained from the south-west. The results from a series of experiments prove that the Karharb\u00e1ri coals are better in quality than those obtained from the R\u00e1niganj field in the ratio of 113 to 100. The principal advantage, however, of the Karharb\u00e1ri field is one of position, as a supplying area for the Upper Provinces and the railway stations west of Lakhisar\u00e1i, there being a saving of 23 miles of carriage as compared with the R\u00e1niganj mines.\n\nKari\u00e1na.\u2014Petty State in the Gohelw\u00e1r Division of K\u00e1thiaw\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 10 villages, including Kari\u00e1na, with seven separate shareholders. Area, 10 square miles. Population of Kari\u00e1na village (1872), 1429; (1881) 1063. Kari\u00e1na village is 12 miles north of L\u00e1thi station on the Dhor\u00e1ji branch of the Bhaunagar-Gondal Railway. The revenue in 1881 was estimated at \u00a32100; tribute of \u00a385 is paid to the British Government, and \u00a330, 14s. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh. The total population of the little State in 1881 was 3156.\n\nKarigatta.\u2014Hill in Ashtragr\u00e1m Sub-division of Mysore District, Mysore State, Southern India, at the junction of the Lokap\u00e1vni river with the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery). Lat. 12\u00b0 26' N., long. 76\u00b0 47' E. An annual festival (j\u00e1tra), held in February or March, is attended by 20,000 people.\n\nK\u00e1rik\u00e1l (K\u00e1raikk\u00e1l, 'the fish pass'\u2014Tamil; Carical Cariukalla\u2014Bartolomeo).\u2014French town and settlement on the Coromandel coast, bounded on the north, south, and west by Tanjore District of the Madras Presidency, and on the east by the Bay of Bengal. Lat.\n(town) $10^\\circ 55' 10''$ N., long. $79^\\circ 52' 20''$ E. Population (according to the latest French statistics in 1883) 93,055, namely, males 46,259, and females 46,796. The number of British subjects residing at K\u00e1rik\u00e1l, according to the Census of 1881, was returned at 4287, of whom 2113 were males and 2174 females. K\u00e1rik\u00e1l is situated on the Coromandel coast, 12 miles north of Negapatam and 6 miles south of Tranquebar. The area of the settlement, which is divided into three communes, containing in all 110 villages, covers 33,787 English acres.\n\nThe country is very fertile, and is watered by six branches of the K\u00e1veri; and by five large, and numerous smaller canals. The capital of the settlement, which gives its name to it, is a neatly built town, situated on the north bank of the Arselaar, an affluent of the K\u00e1veri, about a mile and a quarter from the sea. The French seized the town in 1736, and constructed a strong fort to defend their new possession, which was finally ceded to them, together with 81 villages, on the 21st December 1749, by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Tanjore, the addition being confirmed by treaty in 1754. When it was thus formally given up, the settlement was estimated to yield a yearly revenue of 106,000 rupees (\u00a310,600); but during the 130 odd years that have since elapsed, its budget has not augmented by much more than 60,000 rupees (\u00a36000). The town and fort were besieged by an English force under Major Monson in 1760, and after a gallant defence of ten days, surrendered on the 5th of April. K\u00e1rik\u00e1l came into British possession again on three subsequent occasions, and it was not finally restored to the French until the 14th January 1817.\n\nA brisk trade in rice is conducted with Ceylon throughout the greater part of the year; a less regular import and export business is carried on with the Straits Settlements. An intermittent petty traffic obtains with France; and an emigration society derives much profit from the exportation of Indian labourers to the French colonies of Bourbon, Cayenne, Guadaloupe, and Martinique. On the subject of inland customs, a convention exists with the Madras Government, and all salt consumed in French territory is by treaty purchased from the British; but there is little doubt that the peculiar position of K\u00e1rik\u00e1l, with an open coast on one side, wide-spreading rice lands on the other, and meandering streams between, admits of many opportunities for easy smuggling. The administration of the settlement is carried on by a Chef de Service, appointed by the President of the Republic, who is assisted by eight European officials and a host of native functionaries, all of whom are nominated by the Governor of the French settlements in India. A mayor and corporation of the town also exist, consisting of 13 members, six of whom are Europeans, or descendants of Europeans, and all are elected by universal suffrage. Accredited to the French administration is a British Consular Agent,\nwho is an officer of the Indian staff corps and the direct representative of the Government of Madras. The port of K\u00e1rik\u00e1l is an open roadstead, the anchorage of which varies from 7 to 8 fathoms during the north-east monsoon, to 6 fathoms during the south-west. The port flagstaff shows a fixed light about 34 feet above sea-level, visible for a distance of 10 miles. The revenue of the settlement in 1882-83 amounted to 381,342 francs or \u00a315,253, and the expenditure to 267,043 francs or \u00a310,681. The Budget for 1885 estimated a revenue of 397,745 francs or \u00a315,909, and an expenditure of 327,250 francs or \u00a313,090.\n\nKar\u00edmganj.\u2014Sub-division of Sylhet District, Assam. Area, 1068 square miles. Population (1881) 343,421, namely, Hindus, 181,359; Muhammadans, 161,831; 'others,' 231. Houses, 68,705.\n\nKar\u00edmganj.\u2014Market village in the east of Sylhet District, Assam, and head-quarters of Kar\u00edmganj Sub-division, on the Kusi\u00e1ra or southern branch of the Bar\u00e1k river. Lat. 24\u00b0 52' N., long. 92\u00b0 24' E. Rice, oil-seeds, and raw cotton are exported, in exchange for cotton goods, salt, pulses, tobacco, and bamboos.\n\nKar\u00edmg\u00e1nj.\u2014Village in Maimansingh District, Bengal; situated 9 miles east of Kisoriganj. Large b\u00e1z\u00e1r and reed and jute mart.\n\nKarjat.\u2014Sub-division of Th\u00e1na District, Bombay Presidency. The Sub-division, lying in the south-east of the District, includes the petty division of Kh\u00e1l\u00e1pur. Bounded on the north by Kaly\u00e1n and Murbad Sub-divisions; on the east by the Sahyadri mountains; on the south by Kolaba District; on the west by the M\u00e1ther\u00e1n Hills and Panwel Sub-division. Area, 353 square miles. Population (1872) 77,150; (1881) 82,062.\n\nKarjat may be described as a rough hilly tract lying between the Sahyadri range and the hills of M\u00e1ther\u00e1n. On its northern side dales and valleys diversify the surface; the low lands are divided into rice-fields; while the higher grounds are covered with teak, ain (Terminalia tomentosa), and blackwood. In the east the woodlands become a forest. The Ulh\u00e1s and other streams which rise in the Sahyadris flow through the Sub-division, but are dry channels in the hot season. The rainfall is fairly sufficient, and failure of the rice crop rare. Drinking water is scarce. In 1881, there were 86 ponds, 3 river dams, 642 wells, and some river pools. The rice soil is black, and the upland soil reddish. Besides rice, ragi (Eleusine corocana) and vari (Panicum miliaceum) are staple crops: no fibres are grown. The climate varies greatly with the season. In January and February the nights are extremely cold. Rainfall during ten years ending 1881 averaged 121 inches.\n\nThe population of the Sub-division, according to sex, in 1881, were 42,207 males and 39,855 females, occupying 14,937 houses. Hindus\nnumbered 75,769; Muhammadans, 3732; Christians, 152; Jews, 76; Parsis, 44; and 'others,' 2289. The general occupation is agriculture, and of the 268 villages not one deserves the name of town. The cultivators are mostly Kunbis and Agris. In 1879-80, there were 11,287 holdings in the Sub-division; each holding averaged 7 acres, and paid an average rental of one guinea. As in other parts of the Bombay Presidency, the settlement rates of land revenue were fixed in 1854-56 for a period of thirty years. The total area of tilled land in 1880-81 was 75,766 acres, of which 47.2 per cent. or 35,794 acres lay fallow. Of the remainder, 1504 acres were twice cropped. Of the 41,476 acres under tillage, grain crops occupied 38,795 acres, or 93.5 per cent.; pulses, 2210 acres, or 5.3 per cent.; oil-seeds, 458 acres; and miscellaneous crops, 13 acres. The Sub-division contains 4 criminal courts; police stations (thanas), 2; regular police, 71 men. Land revenue (1882), \u00a311,919.\n\nKarjat.\u2014Head-quarters of Karjat Sub-division, Thana District, Bombay Presidency. Population (1881) 692. Station on the southeast extension of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 62 miles east of Bombay, and 5 miles distant from Matheran. The village, which is rapidly expanding since the construction of the railway, is situate on the south bank of the Ulhas river. Post-office; rest-house; school; and quarters for railway guards and drivers.\n\nKarjat.\u2014Sub-division of Ahmadnagar District, Bombay Presidency; bounded on the east by the Sina river, south by Karmala Sub-division of Sholapur District, west by the Bhima river, and north by Shrigonda Sub-division.\n\nA chain of low hills with flat summits traverses the Sub-division from north-west to south-east, dividing it into two equal parts. The streams from the eastern slope flow into the Sina river, and from the western into the Bhima. The country presents a dismal appearance, owing to the large proportion of rocky and unprofitable ground, almost destitute of vegetation. There are a few level tracts, some of considerable extent, where the soil is deep and rich. In the neighbourhood of the hills the soil is of the poorest description. The rainfall is extremely uncertain, and good harvests are rare. The Sub-division contains about 80 miles of road, and three weekly market towns, namely, Karjat, Mirajgaon, and Rasin. It suffered severely in the famine of 1876-77, when many villages were deserted. The cultivators, owing to a succession of bad harvests, are nearly all in debt. Frequent territorial changes have occurred, the last in 1868-69. Area, 580 square miles. Population (1872) 48,766; (1881) 34,820, namely, 17,797 males and 17,023 females.\n\nNumber of villages, 79. In 1881, Hindus numbered 32,411; Muhammadans, 1332; and 'others,' 1077. Of 115,749 acres, the actual\narea under cultivation in 1882\u201383, grain occupied 87,310 acres; pulses, 14,992; oil-seeds, 10,384; fibres, 2149; and miscellaneous crops, 914 acres. About 135 looms are worked, chiefly in the market towns, for the manufacture of a coarse strong cloth and woollen blankets.\n\nThe Sub-division contains 2 civil and 2 criminal courts; police station (th\u00e1n\u00e1), 1; regular police, 31 men; village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 133. Land revenue (1882\u201383), \u00a36891.\n\nKarjat.\u2014Chief town of the Karjat Sub-division of Ahmadnagar District, Bombay Presidency; situate in lat. 18\u00b0 33' N., and long. 75\u00b0 3' E., 36 miles south by east of Ahmadnagar town. Population (1872) 5535; (1881) 3608. Post-office; large school; weekly market on Saturdays.\n\nK\u00e1rkal.\u2014Town in South K\u00e1nara District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See KARAKAL.\n\nKarkamb.\u2014Town in Pandharpur Sub-division, Shol\u00e1pur District, Bombay Presidency; situate 13 miles north of Pandharpur. Lat. 17\u00b0 52' N., long. 75\u00b0 20' E. Population (1872) 7671; (1881) 6421, namely, Hindus, 5665; Muhammadans, 464; and Jains, 292. The town has a large weaving and thread dyeing industry, with about 800 looms, chiefly producing cheap cloth for women's robes. The betel-vine is also largely grown. Weekly markets on Mondays, when cattle, grain, and cloth are sold. Post-office, and a school.\n\nK\u00e1rk\u00far (Carcoor).\u2014Gh\u00e1t or hill pass in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency, leading from the Ern\u00e1d t\u00e1luk of Malab\u00e1r into Nilgiri District. Lat. 11\u00b0 26' 20\" to 11\u00b0 28' N., long. 76\u00b0 27' 20\" to 76\u00b0 28' E.\n\nK\u00e1rli.\u2014Cave in P\u00fana (Poona) District, Bombay Presidency; situated on the road between Bombay and Poona, in lat. 18\u00b0 45' 20\" N., and long. 73\u00b0 31' 16\" E. It is thus described by Mr. J. Fergusson in his History of Eastern and Indian Architecture:\u2014\u2018It is certainly the largest as well as the most complete Chaitya cave hitherto discovered in India, and was excavated at a time when the style was in its greatest purity. In it all the architectural defects of the previous examples are removed; the pillars of the nave are quite perpendicular. The screen is ornamented with sculpture\u2014its first appearance apparently in such a position\u2014and the style had reached a perfection never afterwards surpassed.\n\n\u2018In the cave there is an inscription on the side of the porch, and another on the lion-pillar in front, which are certainly integral, and ascribe its excavation to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Bh\u00fati or Deva Bh\u00fati, who, according to the Pur\u00e1\u1e47as, reigned B.C. 78; and if this is so, they fix the age of this typical example beyond all cavil.\n\n\u2018The building resembles, to a very great extent, an early Christian church in its arrangements, consisting of a nave and side-aisles, terminating in an apse or semi-dome, round which the aisle is carried.\nThe general dimensions of the interior are 126 ft. from the entrance to the back wall, by 45 ft. 7 in. in width. The side-aisles, however, are very much narrower than in Christian churches, the central one being 25 ft. 7 in., so that the others are only 10 ft. wide, including the thickness of the pillars. As a scale for comparison, it may be mentioned that its arrangement and dimensions are very similar to those of the choir of Norwich Cathedral, or of the Abbaye aux Hommes at Caen, omitting the outer aisles in the latter buildings. The thickness of the piers at Norwich and Caen nearly corresponds to the breadth of the aisles in the Indian temple. In height, however, K\u00e1rl\u00ed is very inferior, being only 42 ft. or perhaps 45 ft. from the floor to the apex, as nearly as can be ascertained.\n\n\u2018Fifteen pillars on each side separate the nave from the aisles; each pillar has a tall base, an octagonal shaft, and a richly ornamented capital, on which kneel two elephants, each bearing two figures, generally a man and a woman, but sometimes two females, all very much better executed than such ornaments usually are. The seven pillars behind the altar are plain octagonal piers, without either base or capital, and the four under the entrance gallery differ considerably from those at the sides. The sculptures on the capitals supply the place usually occupied by frieze and cornice in Grecian architecture; and in other examples, plain painted surfaces occupy the same space. Above this springs the roof, semicircular in general section, but somewhat stilted at the sides, so as to make its height greater than the semi-diameter. It is ornamented even at this day by a series of wooden ribs, probably coeval with the excavation, which prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the roof is not a copy of a masonry arch, but of some sort of timber construction which we cannot now very well understand.\n\n\u2018Immediately under the semi-dome of the apse, and nearly where the altar stands in Christian churches, is placed the daghoba, in this instance a plain dome slightly stilted on a circular drum. As there are no ornaments on it now, and no mortices for woodwork, it probably was originally plastered and painted, or may have been adorned with hangings, which some of the sculptured representations would lead us to suppose was the usual mode of ornamenting these altars. It is surmounted by a Tee, and on this still stand the remains of an umbrella in wood, very much decayed and distorted by age.\n\n\u2018Opposite this is the entrance, consisting of three doorways, under a gallery exactly corresponding with our rood-loft, one leading to the centre, and one to each of the side-aisles; and over the gallery the whole end of the hall is open as in all these Chaitya halls, forming one great window, through which all the light is admitted. This great window is formed in the shape of a horse-shoe, and exactly resembles those used as ornaments on the fa\u00e7ade of this cave, as well as on those\nof Bhaja, Bedsa, and at N\u00e1sik. Within the arch is a framework or centring of work standing free. This, so far as we can judge, is like the ribs of the interior, coeval with the building; at all events, if it has been renewed, it is an exact copy of the original form, for it is found repeated in stone in all the niches of the fa\u00e7ade, over the doorways, and generally as an ornament everywhere, and with the Buddhist \"rail,\" copied from S\u00e1nchi, forms the most usual ornament of the style.\n\n'The presence of the woodwork is an additional proof, if any were wanted, that there were no arches of construction in any of these Buddhist buildings. There neither were nor are any in any Indian building anterior to the Muhammadan Conquest, and very few, indeed, in any Hindu building afterwards.\n\n'To return, however, to K\u00e1rli, the outer porch is considerably wider than the body of the building, being 52 ft. wide, and is closed in front by a screen composed of two stout octagonal pillars, without either base or capital, supporting what is now a plain mass of rock, but once ornamented by a wooden gallery forming the principal ornament of the fa\u00e7ade. Above this, a dwarf colonnade or attic of four columns between pilasters admitted light to the great window; and this again was surmounted by a wooden cornice or ornament of some sort, though we cannot now restore it, since only the mortices remain that attached it to the rock.\n\n'In advance of this screen stands the lion-pillar, in this instance a plain shaft with thirty-two flutes, or rather faces, surmounted by a capital not unlike that at Kesari\u00e1, but at K\u00e1rli supporting four lions instead of one; they seem almost certainly to have supported a chakra, or Buddhist wheel. A similar pillar probably stood on the opposite side, but it has either fallen or been taken down to make way for the little temple that now occupies its place.\n\n'The absence of the wooden ornaments of the external porch, as well as our ignorance of the mode in which this temple was finished laterally, and the porch joined to the main temple, prevent us from judging what the effect of the front would have been if belonging to a free-standing building. But the proportions of such parts as remain are so good, and the effect of the whole so pleasing, that there can be little hesitation in ascribing to such a design a tolerably high rank among architectural compositions.\n\n'Of the interior we can judge perfectly, and it certainly is as solemn and grand as any interior can well be, and the mode of lighting the most perfect\u2014one undivided volume of light coming through a single opening overhead at a very favourable angle, and falling directly on the altar or principal object in the building, leaving the rest in comparative obscurity. The effect is considerably heightened by the closely set thick columns that divide the three aisles from one another, as they\nsuffice to prevent the boundary walls from ever being seen; and, as there are no openings in the walls, the view between the pillars is practically unlimited.\n\n'These peculiarities are found more or less developed in all the other caves of the same class in India, varying only with the age and the gradual change that took place from the more purely wooden forms of these caves to the lithic or stone architecture of the more modern ones. This is the principal test by which their relative ages can be determined, and it proves incontestably that the K\u00e1rli cave was excavated not very long after stone came to be used as a building material in India.'\n\n**Karma.**\u2014Town in Karchh\u00e1na tahsil, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces; situated 12 miles south of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d city, and 6 miles west of Karchh\u00e1na town, in lat. $25^\\circ 17' 52''$ N., and long. $81^\\circ 53'$ E. Population (1881) 3204, namely, males 1648, and females 1556. A market is held twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays, the principal articles of traffic being grain, cotton, hides, cattle, bamboos, and metal vessels, of an estimated annual value of \u00a35000. For police and conservancy purposes, a small house-tax is levied, amounting in 1881\u201382 to \u00a3101.\n\n**Karm\u00e1la.**\u2014Sub-division of Shol\u00e1pur District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. $17^\\circ 57'$ to $18^\\circ 32'$ N., long. $74^\\circ 52'$ to $75^\\circ 31'$ E. Area, 766 square miles; contains 122 villages, with 9300 houses. Population (1872) 105,291; (1881) 61,548, namely, 31,278 males and 30,270 females. The great decrease is due to mortality and emigration during the famine of 1876\u201377. Hindus numbered 57,290; Muhammadans, 2914; and 'others,' 1344.\n\nKarm\u00e1la is in the north of the District, between the Bhim\u00e1 on the west and the Sina on the east. Except the hills near Kem and the dividing ridge, forming the watershed between the two rivers, the country is flat; towards the north it is rough and broken, crossed by many streams. About one-half of the soil is rich and black, and the other red and gravelly. The seasons are uncertain, a really good one, as a rule, not occurring oftener than once in three or four years, when, however, the harvest is unusually abundant. In 1881\u201382, of 229,048 acres, the whole area held for tillage, 31,442 acres, or 13.7 per cent., were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 197,606 acres, 790 were twice cropped. Of the 198,396 acres under tillage, grain occupied 151,081 acres; pulses, 17,555; oil-seeds, 22,521; fibres, 5569; and miscellaneous crops, 1670 acres. In 1882\u201383, the total number of holdings was 5537, with an average area of about 48 acres each. Weekly fairs are held at eight towns and villages; and at Son\u00e1ri an annual fair in April, attended by about 6000 persons. The Sub-division contains 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 3; regular police, 40 men; village watchmen, 206. Land revenue (1882), \u00a313,008.\nKarm\u00e1la.\u2014Chief town and municipality of the Karm\u00e1la Subdivision, Shol\u00e1pur District, Bombay Presidency. Situated 69 miles north-west of Shol\u00e1pur town, and 11 miles north of the Jeur station on the south-east line of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Lat. $18^\\circ 24'$ N., long. $75^\\circ 14' 30''$ E. Population (1872) 6759; (1881) 5071, namely, 2495 males and 2576 females. Area of town site, 188 acres. Hindus numbered 4191; Muhammadans, 677; Jains, 200; and 'others,' 3. Karm\u00e1la was originally the seat of a branch of the Nimb\u00e1lkar family. The founder began and his son finished a fort which still exists, and is used for the sub-divisional offices. This fort, one of the largest in the Deccan, extends over a quarter of a square mile, and contains about 100 houses. Karm\u00e1la grew and became a large trade centre, being a crossing station for the traffic lines from B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t through B\u00e1rsi to Poona, and between Ahmadnagar and Shol\u00e1pur. Most of this traffic has now passed to the railway, but Karm\u00e1la is still a large mart for cattle, grain, oil, and piece-goods. A weekly market is held on Friday, and the town has a small weaving industry, with 60 looms. The water-supply is from springs in wells three-quarters of a mile to the south. The water is carried through an earthenware conduit to dipping wells in the town. An annual fair lasting four days. Municipal income (1881), \u00a3483; expenditure, \u00a3463; incidence of municipal taxation, 1s. 11d. per head. Post-office, dispensary, school, and reading-room.\n\nKarm\u00e1r.\u2014Petty State in the Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r Division of K\u00e1thiaw\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village, with 1 landholder. The revenue in 1881 was estimated at \u00a3511; tribute is paid of \u00a314 to the British Government, and \u00a33, 4s. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh. In addition, \u00a35, 18s. is paid as sukhr\u00ed on account of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. The estate or village, with a population of 648 souls, is situated six miles to the north-east of R\u00e1npur, and six miles south-east of Chura, stations on the Bhaunagar-Gondal Railway. Area, 3 square miles.\n\nKarnagarh.\u2014Hill, or more properly plateau, near Bh\u00e1galpur town, Bh\u00e1galpur District, Bengal. Lat. $25^\\circ 14' 45''$ N., long. $86^\\circ 58' 30''$ E. It formerly contained the lines of the Hill Rangers, a body of troops raised from among the hill people by Mr. Augustus Cleveland, Collector of the District, in 1780, for the pacification of the lawless jungle tribes. The corps was disbanded in 1863 on the re-organization of the native army. A wing of a native regiment is at times cantoned here.\n\nThe only objects of interest are Sivaite temples of some celebrity. These consist of four buildings (maths), with square bases and the usual pointed pinnacles. One is several hundred years old, the others being modern buildings. Numbers of Hindus, though not usually worshippers of Siva, pay their devotions here on the last day of the month of K\u00e1rtik. The temples contain several of the so-called seats of Mah\u00e1deo\nor Siva, one much prized being made of stone from the Narbad\u00e1, said to have come from the marble rocks near Jabalpur. Two monuments are here erected to the memory of Mr. Cleveland,\u2014one by Government, and the other by the landholders of the District. Karnagarh is said to derive its name from Karna, a pious Hindu king of olden times, celebrated for the enormous sums he bestowed on Br\u00e1hmans. The plateau is locally known as the kil\u00e1 or fort, and is the reputed site of the good R\u00e1j\u00e1's palace.\n\n**Karn\u00e1l.**\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between 29\u00b0 9' and 30\u00b0 11' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 13' and 77\u00b0 15' 30\" E. long. Karn\u00e1l is the northernmost District of the Delhi Division, and stands twenty-first in order of area, and fourteenth in order of population among the thirty-two Districts of the Province. It is bounded on the north by the District of Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umbala) and the Native State of Pati\u00e1l\u00e1, on the west by the Native States of Pati\u00e1l\u00e1 and J\u00ednd, on the south by the Districts of Delhi and Rohtak, and on the east by the river Jumna (Jamun\u00e1), which separates it from the North-Western Provinces. The District includes 45 outlying villages, scattered throughout Pati\u00e1l\u00e1 territory, the furthest of which, Budl\u00e1d\u00e1, is 101 miles distant from head-quarters. It is divided into three tahsils, of which P\u00e1n\u00edpat includes the southern, Karn\u00e1l the central and northeastern, and Kaithal the western and north-western portions of the District. Area, 2396 square miles. Population in 1881, 622,621 souls. The administrative head-quarters are at Karn\u00e1l town.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Karn\u00e1l forms a portion of the low dividing ridge which separates the watersheds of the Sutlej and the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1), its north-western angle being drained by small streams which swell the freshet torrent of the Ghaggar, while its eastern front slopes gently down to the banks of the Jumna itself. The District falls naturally into two divisions\u2014b\u00e1ngar, or upland plain, and kh\u00e1dar, or low-lying land, which fringes the valley of the great river. The former consists in its highest portion of a grazing country, covered in favourable seasons with rank and luxuriant grasses, whose monotonous level is broken by belts of brushwood, and interspersed with local hollows fringed with trees of larger growth. It is traversed in its north-western extremity by the Ghaggar and the Saraswati, whose floods fertilize a large area. These open pastures are succeeded to the south and east by a cultivated zone, through whose midst the Western Jumna Canal distributes its various branches. Three main channels convey the water towards Delhi, Hiss\u00e1r, and Roht\u00e1k, while minor courses penetrate the fields around in every direction.\n\nUnhappily, however, the high level of the canal, and the imperfections of the distributary system, called upon by the increasing demand for irrigation to carry a supply far larger than that for which it was designed,\nhave led to much flooding, which has produced its usual bad effects on the health of this region. Lines of swamps run along the sides of the embankments, and seriously interfere, not only with the sanitary condition, but also with the cultivation of the neighbouring villages; while soda salts brought to the surface by the high spring level, cover with a snow-like efflorescence, which is fatal to vegetation, many square miles of what were once fertile fields. Government is at present engaged on an extensive improvement in the upper course of the canal, which is now (1883) on the point of completion, and will, it is hoped, remedy this defect, and render the work an unmixed benefit to the people whose lands it was designed to fertilize.\n\nBetween the irrigated country and the river stretches the kh\u00e1dar, or wide valley of the Jumna. It is less abundantly wooded than the remainder of the District, though even here date-palms abound, and a thick jungle skirts in places the banks of the river.\n\nThe banks of the larger streams are fringed with forest trees, and groves of mangoes mark the neighbourhood of every temple or homestead. Indeed, as a whole, Karn\u00e1l is better supplied with trees than most of the plain country of the Punjab.\n\nThe Jumna forms the entire eastern boundary of the District for a distance of 73 miles, separating Karn\u00e1l from Sah\u00e1ranpur, Muzaffarnagar, and Meerut (Merath) Districts in the North-Western Provinces. Its bed varies from half a mile to a mile in width, of which the cold-weather stream only occupies a few hundred yards. Changes are continually taking place in the river-bed. Sandbanks shift from one side to the other of the main channel, and from time to time the whole stream changes its course. The Jumna, however, is by no means so capricious as many of the Punjab rivers. Its present tendency is slightly towards the east; and within the last few years it has changed its channel below Karn\u00e1l town, so that six villages, formerly in Muzaffarnagar, are now included in this District. The other rivers or streams are the Ghaggar, Saraswati, Buri Nadi, Chautang, and Na\u00ed Nadi. The District contains numerous jhils and swamps, principally along the lines of the canals, and near the confluence of the Ghaggar and Saraswati. It is intended to drain some of these jhils, and the drainage cuts have been commenced.\n\nThe Western Jumna Canal enters Karn\u00e1l from Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 District about 25 miles north-west of Karn\u00e1l town. It flows through the low-lying kh\u00e1dar to a point four miles below Karn\u00e1l town, where the Grand Trunk Road crosses it by an old Mughal bridge, and then enters the upland or b\u00e1ngar tract. From this point it holds a southwest course for about 18 miles till, near the village of Rer, the H\u00e1ns\u00ed branch strikes off westwards, via Saf\u00eddon, and occupying the bed of the Chautang, flows on to H\u00e1ns\u00ed and Hiss\u00e1r. From Rer, the Delhi\nbranch runs south to Delhi city. About ten miles below Rer, another branch strikes off south-westwards towards Rohtak; and a few miles further on, just upon the confines of the District, another branch goes to But\u00e1n\u00e1. All these branches are used for irrigation in Karn\u00e1l District, and distributary channels from one or other of them penetrate to all parts of the b\u00e1ngar tract.\n\nThe only mineral products are kankar and sal-ammoniac. The former is plentiful in most parts of the District, generally in the nodular form, but occasionally compacted into blocks. Sal-ammoniac is only made in the Kaithal tahsil.\n\nThe District is famous for its sport. Antelope, nilgai, and other large game are plentiful in the northern jungles; partridge, hare, and quail abound throughout the District; while the canal and its attendant jhils afford a home for numerous water-fowl, whose depredations seriously interfere with the out-turn of the rice crop. Fish abound in the Jumna, in the swamps along the canals, and in most of the village ponds.\n\nHistory.\u2014No District of India can boast of a more ancient history than Karn\u00e1l, as almost every town or stream is connected with the sacred legends of the Mah\u00e1bhdrata. The city of Karn\u00e1l itself, from which the modern District has taken its name, is said by tradition to owe its foundation to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Karna, the mythical champion of the Kauravas in the great war which forms the theme of the national epic, while the greater part of the northern uplands are included in the Kurukshetr or battle-field of the opposing armies of the Kauravas and Pandavas. From the same authority we learn that P\u00e1nipat, in the south of the District, was one of the pledges demanded from Duryodhan by Yudhisthira as the price of peace in that famous conflict.\n\nIn historical times, the plains of P\u00e1nipat have three times been the theatre of battles which decided the fate of Upper India. It was here that Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Lod\u00ed and his vast host were defeated in 1526 by the veteran army of B\u00e1bar, when the Mughal dynasty first made good its pretensions to the Empire of Delhi. Thirty years later, in 1556, the greatest of that line, Akbar, re-asserted the claims of his family on the same battle-field against the Hindu general of the house of Sher Sh\u00e1h, which had driven the heirs of B\u00e1bar from the throne for a brief interval. Finally, under the walls of P\u00e1nipat, on the 7th of January 1761, was fought the battle which shattered the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 confederation, and raised Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1n\u00ed for a while to the position of arbiter of the entire empire.\n\nIt was at Karn\u00e1l town that the Persian N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h defeated the feeble Mughal Emperor, Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, in 1759. During the troublous period which ensued, the Sikhs managed to introduce themselves into the country about Karn\u00e1l; and in 1767, one of their chieftains,\nDesu Singh, appropriated the fort of Kaithal, which had been built during the reign of Akbar. His descendants, the Bh\u00e1\u00eds of Kaithal, were reckoned amongst the most important cis-Sutlej princes. The country immediately surrounding the town of Karn\u00e1l was occupied about the same date by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of J\u00ednd; but in 1795 it was captured by the ubiquitous Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and bestowed by them upon George Thomas, the military adventurer of Hari\u00e1na. He was, however, almost immediately dispossessed by the Sikh R\u00e1j\u00e1, Gurdit Singh of L\u00e1dwa, who held it till 1805, when it was captured by an English force, and confiscated as a punishment for the R\u00e1j\u00e1 having actively opposed the British after the battle of Delhi in September 1803.\n\nKarn\u00e1l was included in the Conquered Provinces which we obtained from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s by the treaties of Sarj\u00ed-Anjang\u00e1on and Poona (1803-04). In pursuance of the policy of Lord Cornwallis, Kaithal, and the numerous petty States which bordered Karn\u00e1l on the north-west, remained in the hands of their Sikh possessors, while the remainder of the District was parcelled out among those who had rendered us service. Of these latter, the Path\u00e1n Naw\u00e1b of Kunjpura, and a Hindu family who still enjoy the revenue of the town and pargan\u00e1 of Karn\u00e1l, alone retain their grants, all the others having lapsed on the death of the holders. Under Sikh rule, the sole object of the local governments appears to have been the collection of the largest possible revenue. Every rupee that could be extracted from the native cultivators was pressed into the fiscal bag of their Sikh over-lords, while cattle-lifting and open violence went unpunished on every side. Sir H. Lawrence, who effected the land settlement of Kaithal after the British occupation in 1843, described the Sikh system as one of \u2018sparing the strong and squeezing the weak.\u2019 Much of the District had formed a sort of No-Man\u2019s land between the Sikhs and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and when we took it in 1803, \u2018more than four-fifths was overrun by forests, and the inhabitants either removed or were exterminated.\u2019 In 1819, the Delhi territory was parcelled out into Districts, one of which had its head-quarters at P\u00e1n\u00edpat. The northern portion of the present District, held by the Sikh princes, lapsed from time to time into the hands of the British. Kaithal fell to us on the death of Desu Singh\u2019s last representative, in 1843. The disorder of the Sikh Government was immediately suppressed by prompt measures; two large cattle-lifting raids were made within a week of the British occupation, and the timely severity with which the culprits were apprehended and punished taught the predatory classes what treatment they might expect from the hands of their new masters. The petty State of Thanesar lapsed in 1850, and its capital was made for a time the head-quarters of a separate District, in which Kaithal was included; but after the Mutiny of 1857, when the Delhi territory was transferred to the Punjab.\nThanesar District was broken up, and its pargan\u00e1s redistributed in 1862 between Karn\u00e1l and Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umballa). The course of events during late years has been marked by few incidents, and nothing more than local marauding occurred during the troubles of 1857. The towns are not generally in a flourishing condition, and the opening of the railway on the opposite bank of the Jumna has somewhat prejudicially affected the trade of Karn\u00e1l. But although the District cannot compare with its wealthy neighbours in the Do\u00e1b, it still possesses great agricultural resources and considerable commerce.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Owing to numerous territorial changes in the pargan\u00e1s at present composing Karn\u00e1l District, it is impossible to give comparative statistics of the number of inhabitants previous to the Census of 1868. In that year an enumeration, taken over an area corresponding to that of the present District (2396 square miles), disclosed a population of 617,997. In 1881, the Census returned a total population of 622,621, showing a nominal increase of 4624 in thirteen years, thus apparently indicating that the population of what was in great part a tract desolated by continuous struggles between the Sikhs and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, has now reached the stationary stage. The results of the Census of 1881 may be briefly summarized as follows:\u2014Area, 2396 square miles; number of towns and villages, 863; number of houses, 91,442, of which 68,271 are occupied, and 23,171 unoccupied. Number of families, 118,608. Total population, 622,621, namely, males 336,171, and females 286,450; proportion of males, 53\u00b79 per cent. The excessive preponderance of males may be held to imply the former prevalence of female infanticide, which has not yet been entirely stamped out. Classified according to age, there were, under 15 years of age\u2014males 121,665, females 101,145; total children, 222,810, or 35\u00b78 per cent. of the population. Above 15 years\u2014males 214,506, and females 185,305; total adults, 399,811, or 64\u00b72 per cent. of the population. From the foregoing figures the following averages may be deduced:\u2014Persons per square mile, 260; villages per square mile, 0\u00b736; persons per village, 721; houses per square mile, 38; persons per house, 9\u00b712. As regards religious distinctions, the Hindu element decidedly preponderates, its adherents being returned at 453,662, or 72\u00b78 per cent. of the inhabitants. The Muhammadans rank second, with 156,183, or 25\u00b71 per cent. The Sikhs form a mere sprinkling of 8036 persons, being only 1\u00b73 per cent. of the total. The remaining population consists of\u2014Jains, 4655, and Christians, 85.\n\nIn the ethnical classification, the J\u00e1ts rank first, numbering 95,108, nearly all Hindus. As usual, they represent the chief agricultural element, being careful and thrifty cultivators; yet here, as in most other Districts, they are confined to the once sterile uplands, while the R\u00e1jputs and G\u00fajars occupy the fruitful kh\u00e1dar. Second in numerical\norder come the Br\u00e1hmans, with 55,168, most of whom are engaged in cultivation, being found most thickly in the Jumna valley. The Cham\u00e1rs, who form the majority of the landless labouring class across the Jumna in the Upper Do\u00e1b, rank third, with 54,067. The R\u00e1jputs number 53,260 persons, chiefly Muhammadans, and bear the same reputation for thriftlessness as elsewhere. The Baniy\u00e1s or trading class number 40,599, all Hindus or Jains. The Rors, an agricultural caste akin to the J\u00e1ts, whom they almost equal as husbandmen, number 34,094. The pastoral Gujars number 21,898 in all, of whom about one-third are converts to Isl\u00e1m; they have not yet adopted an agricultural life, and their villages are scattered about the low-lying kh\u00e1dar country. The other most numerous castes and clans are\u2014Chuhras, 31,288; Jhinwars, 31,200; Kumbh\u00e1rs, 14,712; Tarkhans, 13,787; Nais, 10,307; M\u00e1l\u00eds, 10,124. The most numerous Muhammadan class by race descent, as apart from the descendants of converts from Hinduism, are the Shaikhs, who number 13,789.\n\nThe Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts has a mission station in Karn\u00e1l town, established in 1865, and two branch missions at P\u00e1n\u00edpat and Kaithal, established in 1882. The number of Native Christians connected with the mission, who are employed as mission agents, is returned at 36. The operations of the mission include zan\u00e1na teaching, girls\u2019 schools, a dispensary under charge of a female medical missionary, and a school for children of low castes, such as Cham\u00e1rs.\n\nDivision of the People into Town and Country.\u2014The Census of 1881 returned the urban population at 78,328, residing in the following six towns:\u2014Karn\u00e1l, 23,133; Panipat, 25,022; Kaithal, 14,754; Sewan, 5717; Pundri, 4977; and Kunjpura, 4725. The total urban population therefore amounted to 12\u00b758 per cent. of the inhabitants of the District. Of the 863 towns and villages, 225 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 284 from two to five hundred; 182 from five hundred to a thousand; 117 from one thousand to two thousand; 35 from two thousand to three thousand; 16 from three to five thousand; 1 from five to ten thousand; 1 from ten to fifteen thousand; and 2 from twenty to thirty thousand. As regards occupation, the Census classifies the male population over 15 years of age into the following seven groups:\u2014Class (1) Professional class, including all persons in civil or military employ, and the learned professions, 7779; (2) domestic and menial class, 14,105; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, and carriers, 5742; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 117,216; (5) industrial and manufacturing class, 50,712; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, 16,993; (7) unspecified, 2049. The language in common use among the people is Hind\u00ed.\nAgriculture.\u2014The total area under cultivation in Karn\u00e1l is returned at 680,319 acres; while the uncultivated area amounts to 853,671 acres, of which 562,558 are cultivable. The principal spring crop of the year is wheat, the yield of the irrigated villages being particularly large. The autumn harvest consists of rice, cotton, and sugar-cane, besides millets and pulses for home consumption. The area under each staple in 1882 was as follows:\u2014Spring crops\u2014wheat, 91,691 acres; barley, 39,144 acres; gram, 74,970 acres; Autumn crops\u2014rice, 10,826 acres; jo\u00e1r, 174,948 acres; b\u00e1jra, 54,022 acres; cotton, 22,688 acres; and sugar-cane, 17,869 acres. The growth of the more lucrative crops is on the increase, under the stimulus given by the canal, which ensures a fair return for the labour expended even in unfavourable seasons. The average out-turn per acre is estimated at 732 lbs. for rice, 159 lbs. for indigo, 173 lbs. for cotton, 1188 lbs. for sugar, 643 lbs. for wheat, and 397 lbs. for millet and the inferior grains.\n\nIrrigation is extensively practised, 249,160 acres being artificially supplied with water; of these, 145,933 acres are irrigated by Government works from the different branches of the Western Jumna Canal, and 103,227 acres by private enterprise from wells. The use of manure is on the increase. When the Government stud farm was established at Karn\u00e1l in 1853, the villagers could not be induced to cart away the manure as a gift; but they are now willing to pay a fair price for the use of it. The Government stud farm was abolished in 1875. But horse and mule breeding are still carried on from Government stallions at Basdh\u00e1r\u00e1. General Perrott, the superintendent of the late Government stud, to whom some of the buildings, lands, and stock were made over on the abolition of the stud, has carried on horse-breeding as a private undertaking, and has set on foot what promises to be a successful breeding stud. There is also a Government cattle farm at Karn\u00e1l. The saline efflorescence known as reh, so deleterious in its effects that even grass will not grow where it makes its appearance, has caused much trouble in the neighbourhood of the canal. The village communities are strong and united, most of them owning their lands by the tenure known as bh\u00e1y\u00e1ch\u00e1ra, or brotherhood. Traces of the primitive communal system, however, still survive; and cases are recorded in which communities have voluntarily given up the bh\u00e1y\u00e1ch\u00e1ra organization, and redistributed their lands on this principle of shares.\n\nThe Census Report returns the total agricultural population at 331,796, and the non-agricultural at 290,825. These figures, however, include as agricultural only that part of the population whose sole occupation is the cultivation of the land; they exclude not only the considerable number who combine agriculture with other operations, but also the much larger number of artisans, labourers, and village servants who\nare paid in kind, and who thus depend in a great measure for their livelihood upon the harvest of the year. The majority of the agricultural population are also landholders. According to the Census of 1881, the adult male agricultural population consisted of 75,256 landholders, 21,032 tenants (chiefly tenants-at-will), 14,359 joint cultivators, and 3071 agricultural labourers.\n\nRents, if calculated on a money basis, rule as follows, according to the nature of the crop:\u2014Rice, from 6s. to 10s. per acre; cotton, from 10s. to 14s.; sugar-cane, from 16s. to 22s.; wheat land, irrigated, from 8s. to 13s.\u2014unirrigated, from 6s. to 9s.; inferior grains, irrigated, 4s. to 6s.\u2014unirrigated, 3s. to 4s. per acre. As a fact, rent, save in the form of a share of the produce, is almost unknown. True rent is, however, now beginning to make its way in the District. Agricultural wages are still paid in kind, at the same rates which have been current from time immemorial. Hired labour is made but little use of by the villagers, except at harvest time. Sayyids and others, who will not do manual labour, etc., however, often cultivate their fields by servants. Prices in 1873 ruled as follows:\u2014Wheat, 22 sers per rupee, or 5s. 1d. per cwt.; barley, 38 sers per rupee, or 2s. 11\u00bdd. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r and Indian corn, 30 sers per rupee, or 3s. 8\u00bdd. per cwt. In 1882, prices were returned as under:\u2014Wheat, 20 sers per rupee, or 5s. 7d. per cwt.; barley, 34 sers per rupee, or 3s. 4d. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r and Indian corn, 31 sers per rupee, or 3s. 7d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The District is not remarkable for its commerce or manufactures. Grain and other raw materials are exported to Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umballa), Hiss\u00e1r, and Delhi, and raw sugar into the Do\u00e1b; while the return trade consists of European piece-goods, salt, wool, and oil-seeds. The produce of the canal villages goes via Karn\u00e1l town, where a brisk trade is carried on in either direction along the Grand Trunk Road; and also very largely via P\u00e1n\u00edpat across the river, to Sh\u00e1mli in the Do\u00e1b, the great local sugar mart. Local trade is principally conducted through the village shopkeepers (baniy\u00e1s), who deal with the large traders at the towns of Karn\u00e1l, Kaithal, and P\u00e1n\u00edpat. But a considerable trade is also carried on by the villagers themselves, during the hot season, when their field bullocks would otherwise be idle.\n\nA large quantity of cotton is woven for local use, the number of looms being returned at 2080, and the annual value of their out-turn at \u00a349,993. Sal-ammoniac is obtained from the clay of Kaithal and G\u00fala to the value of about \u00a33500 per annum. Karn\u00e1l town has a few blanket factories, and supplies many regiments with boots (a relic of the days when there were cantonments at Karn\u00e1l); and ornamental glassware, metal vessels, and hide oil jars are made at P\u00e1n\u00edpat. The District has no railway, but the Grand Trunk Road passes through its midst,\nconnecting it with Delhi on one side, and Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 on the other. There are 69 miles of metalled and 540 miles of unmetalled road in the District. The Jumna, with a course of 73 miles along the eastern boundary of Karn\u00e1l, is occasionally used as a waterway for flat-bottomed boats; the main canal, with the Delhi branch, has been hitherto navigable only by rafts, and they have to be broken up several times during the passage. The new canal, now approaching completion, will, when fully opened, be navigable by large boats.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, three extra-Assistant Commissioners, and three tahsild\u00e1rs, with their deputies, besides the usual medical and constabulary officers. The revenue in 1872-73 amounted to \u00a378,847, of which \u00a367,048 was derived from the land-tax. Ten years later, in 1882-83, the revenue of the District had fallen to \u00a372,133, of which \u00a358,063 was contributed by the land-tax. The other principal items are stamps and local rates. Number of criminal courts, 17; of civil courts, 12. For police purposes the District is sub-divided into 17 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s). The regular police amounted in 1882 to 458 men of all grades, supplemented by a municipal force of 156 constables; giving a total establishment, for the protection of person and property, of 614 men, or 1 policeman to every 3'9 square miles of the area and every 1014 of the population. There is also a village watch or rural police numbering 1116 men. There is one jail at Karn\u00e1l town, with an average daily number of 210 prisoners in 1882. The average cost per inmate was \u00a35, 15s. 10\u00bdd.; while the net cash earnings of each labouring prisoner amounted to \u00a32, 14s.\n\nCattle-stealing is the normal crime of Karn\u00e1l District. These thefts are performed in a systematic manner, the animals being rapidly transferred to great distances and to other Districts by accomplices. Cattle-lifting, however, is not now so prevalent, owing to the heavy punishment awarded to offenders. Formerly, heads of families of respectable birth would demur to give a daughter in marriage to a man who had not proved his capability to support a family by cattle-lifting. The S\u00e1nsyas, Biluch\u00eds, and T\u00e1gus belong to the predatory tribes, and many of them are proclaimed under the Criminal Tribes Act. With regard to the S\u00e1nsyas and Biluch\u00eds, this Act has been worked with much success, and the numbers on the proscribed roll are decreasing steadily. The T\u00e1gus, however, are still addicted to thieving, and they travel long distances in small gangs for this purpose.\n\nEducation is making some progress, though not so rapidly as could be desired. In 1872-73 there were 99 schools in operation within the District, more than half of which were in receipt of Government aid. The total number of pupils on the rolls was 2541;\nand the sum expended on instruction from the public funds amounted to \u00a31409. In 1882-83, the Education Department returned a total of 43 State-inspected schools, with 2129 pupils, besides 121 indigenous schools attended by 1541 pupils. Total, 164 schools of all classes, with 3670 pupils. The Census Report of 1881 returned 2715 boys and 63 girls as under instruction, besides 13,226 males and 90 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The Karn\u00e1l District School, located in the old fort, had an average number of 327 pupils on the rolls in 1882. Among indigenous schools, the Arabic School at P\u00e1nipat is worthy of notice. It is supported by voluntary contributions, and is attended by some thirty or forty boys, chiefly sons of middle-class Muhammadans of the town. A branch of the Delhi Zan\u00e1na Mission is established at Karn\u00e1l town, the ladies of which visit women in the city, and teach them and their children.\n\nThe District is sub-divided, for fiscal and administrative purposes, into 3 tahsils, and contains 863 villages, owned in 1881 by 76,999 shareholders. There are municipalities at Karn\u00e1l, Panipat, Kaithal, Pundri, and Kunjpura. Their aggregate income amounted to \u00a33325 in 1871-72, and the incidence of taxation per head of population was 10\u00bdd. In 1882-83, the total municipal income from the same towns was \u00a35879, the average incidence being 1s. 7d. per head.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The average annual rainfall at Karn\u00e1l town is returned at 29\u00b780 inches, although in certain tracts the rainfall is below 18 inches. In 1881, the rainfall at the head-quarters town was only 22\u00b750 inches, or 7\u00b730 inches below the average. No trustworthy thermometrical returns are published. In the portion of the uplands watered by the canal, malarious fever, dysentery, and enlargement of the spleen are very prevalent, owing to stagnant morasses which result from excessive percolation. Some of the villages have suffered terribly from these causes. Bowel complaints are also common, and small-pox and cholera appear occasionally in a more or less epidemic form. The total number of deaths recorded in 1872 was \u2014 13,370, or 22 per thousand, and in 1882, 19,759, or 32 per thousand. The fever-rate for the same years was 12\u00b702 per thousand in 1872, and 19\u00b795 per thousand in 1882. The District contains 6 charitable dispensaries, which in 1882 afforded medical relief to 2016 in-door and 36,458 out-door patients. [For further information regarding Karn\u00e1l, see the Gazetteer of Karn\u00e1l District, published under the authority of the Punjab Government (Lahore, 1884). Also Mr. D. C. J.

It may be divided into three parts\u2014the low riverain valley of the Jumna to the west; the canal watered highlands to the south; and the pasture lands of the Nardak to the north-west. Area, 832 square miles, containing 359 villages or towns, with 23,485 houses. Population (1881) 231,094, or 278 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Hindus, 161,577; Muhammadans, 65,747; Sikhs, 2594; Jains, 1129; and Christians, 47. Of a total assessed area of 820 square miles, or 1,533,990 acres, according to the last quinquennial agricultural statistics of the Punjab Government for 1878\u201379, 241,870 acres were returned as under cultivation, 174,683 acres as cultivable, and 112,629 acres as uncultivable waste. The average annual area under cultivation for the five years 1877\u201378 to 1881\u201382, was 203,264 acres, the principal crops being\u2014rice, 56,778 acres; wheat, 32,631; jo\u00e1r, 58,535; barley, 22,353; gram, 13,478; Indian corn, 5011; cotton, 2616; and sugar-cane, 2980 acres. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a316,192. The administrative staff, including the head-quarters for the whole District, comprises a Deputy Commissioner, with 3 Assistant or extra-Assistant Commissioners, 1 tahsild\u00e1r, 1 munsif, and 1 honorary magistrate. These officers preside over 7 criminal and 6 civil courts. The tahsil contains 6 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), with a regular police force of 172 officers and men, besides 436 village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs).\n\nKarn\u00e1l.\u2014Town, municipality, and administrative head-quarters of Karn\u00e1l District, Punjab. Lat. 29\u00b0 42' 17\" N., long. 77\u00b0 1' 45\" E. Founded, according to tradition, by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Karna, champion of the Kauravas in the great war of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, and certainly a city of immemorial antiquity. Occupied by the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of J\u00ednd about the middle of the last century, wrested from them in 1795 by George Thomas, the adventurer of Hari\u00e1na, and immediately seized by the Sikh R\u00e1j\u00e1 of L\u00e1dw\u00e1, from whom the British captured it in 1805. (See Historical section, Karn\u00e1l District.) It was conferred together with its pargan\u00e1 in permanent tenure (istimr\u00e1r) upon the Mandal Naw\u00e1bs in exchange for a similar grant held by them across the Jumna. The fort was occupied as a British cantonment for many years, suitable compensation being made to the Naw\u00e1b, but was finally abandoned in 1841. In 1840, it was selected as a residence for Dost Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, Am\u00edr of K\u00e1bul, in which he was detained for about six months, on his way to Calcutta, as a State prisoner. The fort was afterwards used successively as a jail, as quarters for a native cavalry regiment, as a poorhouse, and was ultimately made over to the Education Department for the District school.\n\nKarn\u00e1l stands upon high ground, just above the old bank of the Jumna, overlooking the kh\u00fadar, or lowland tract. The river now\nflows 7 miles away to the east; but the Western Jumna Canal passes just beneath the town, and, intercepting the drainage, causes malarious fever, which has given Karn\u00e1l an evil reputation. A wall 12 feet in height encloses the town, and forms the back of many houses.\n\nThe population of the town, which in 1868 numbered 27,022, had by 1881 fallen to 23,133, namely, males 12,626, and females 10,507. Classified according to religion, the population in the latter year consisted of\u2014Hindus, 15,215; Muhammadans, 7550; Jains, 213; Sikhs, 110; and \u2018others,\u2019 45. Number of houses, 3679. The decrease of the population is in some measure due to the opening of the railway on the opposite bank of the Jumna, which has prejudiced the commercial importance of Karn\u00e1l, but still more to its unhealthiness, caused by the canal and swamps, which has increased of late years. Municipal income in 1875-76, \u00a31532; in 1882-83, \u00a32057; the average incidence of taxation being 1s. 9\u00bdd. per head of the population.\n\nThe streets of the town are well paved, but nearly all are narrow and tortuous; the sanitary arrangements are fairly good. The civil station stretches to the north of the town, where the cantonment formerly lay, and comprises the court-house and treasury, tahsili, police station, staging bungalow, and several sar\u00e1\u00eds, besides a small church, dismantled since the removal of the cantonment. Outside the town are the District and many other schools, charitable dispensary, and town hall. The Government formerly maintained a large stud farm here, but it was abolished in 1875. A branch cattle farm has been recently established in connection with the Government farm at Hiss\u00e1r. Brisk trade in the produce of the canal villages with Delhi and Amb\u00e1l\u00e1. Manufacture of country cloth for local consumption, and blankets and boots for export. The blanket trade employs about 100 looms.\n\nKarn\u00e1la (Funnel Hill).\u2014Fort and hill in Th\u00e1na District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 19\u00b0 53' N., and long. 73\u00b0 10' E., a few miles north-west of the Vegavati river, and 8 miles south of Panwel; elevation, 1560 feet above sea-level. Commands the high road between the Bor Pass and the Panwel and Apta rivers. The hill has an upper and lower fort. In the centre of the upper fort is the \u2018funnel,\u2019 an almost inaccessible basalt pillar about 125 feet high. The funnel rock is locally known as the P\u00e1ndu\u2019s tower. From the south-west of the hill can be seen the island-studded harbour of Bombay.\n\nThe fort was often taken and retaken during the turbulent period of Indian history. Under the Muhammadans, Karn\u00e1la was garrisoned to overawe the North Konk\u00e1n. Troops from Ahmadnagar took it in 1540. The Portuguese captured it soon after, but gave it up on receiving a ransom of \u00a31750 a year. Sivaj\u00ed, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 leader, seized it in 1670, driving out the Mughals. On the death of Sivaj\u00ed, Karn\u00e1la was\nrecaptured by Aurangzeb's generals, and was held by the Mughals till at least 1735. Shortly afterwards, it must have again passed into the hands of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, for in 1740 the Peshw\u00e1's power was established over the whole of the Deccan. In 1818 the fort was captured, and passed into British possession, together with the whole remaining territory held by the Peshw\u00e1. It is now in ruins.\n\n**Karnaphuli.**\u2014River of Bengal; rises in a lofty range of hills beyond the north-east border of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, in lat. $22^\\circ 55'$ N., and long. $92^\\circ 44'$ E.; and, after flowing a circuitous course southwards and westwards, finally falls into the Bay of Bengal, in lat. $22^\\circ 12'$ N., and long. $91^\\circ 49' 30''$ E., 12 miles below the town and port of Chittagong, which is situated on its right bank. As far up as Chittagong town, the river is navigable by steamers and sea-going vessels; and for large native cargo boats as high as Kas\u00e1lang in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, a distance by river of about 96 miles. Beyond K\u00e1s\u00e1lang, for a distance of 20 miles, the river is navigable by smaller craft; but above this point navigation is much impeded by a succession of low falls and long rocky slopes, about a mile in length, known as the Barkal rapids. Following still up stream, the river narrows considerably as it flows among the higher ranges of hills. Its course continues north for some distance, and then sweeps to the east till the Demagiri falls are reached, some three days' journey from Barkal. Above this, it becomes an insignificant stream in a rocky bed, only navigable by the smallest canoes. The chief tributaries of the Karnaphuli are the K\u00e1s\u00e1lang, Chingr\u00ed, Kapt\u00e1i, and Rankhiang rivers in the Hill Tracts, and the Hald\u00e1 in Chittagong District, the latter a navigable stream which empties itself into the main river from the north, being navigable by native boats for 24 miles throughout the year. Principal river-side towns and villages\u2014Kas\u00e1lang, Rangamati, Chandraguna, Ran-gunia, and Chittagong.\n\n**Karn\u00e1tik or Carnatic (Kannanda; Kanara; Karn\u00e1ta; Karn\u00e1taka-desa, 'the Kanarese country').**\u2014The name erroneously applied by modern European writers to the Tamil country\u2014that is, the country from Cape Comorin to the Northern Circars, lying east of the Gh\u00e1ts, and reaching to the sea on the Coromandel coast. Including Nellore, which is a Telugu-speaking District, it stretches from $8^\\circ 10'$ to $16^\\circ$ N. lat., and from $77^\\circ 19'$ to $80^\\circ 19'$ E. long. The modern application of the name Karn\u00e1tik includes the territories of Arcot, Madura, and Tanjore, or, going back to a yet earlier period, the kingdoms of Chola, Pandya, and part of Chera,\u2014countries, as Wilkes says, never anciently included in the Karn\u00e1tik. The boundaries of the true Karn\u00e1tik, or Karn\u00e1taka-desa, are given by the same authority as 'commencing near the town of B\u00edd\u00e1r (Beder), in latitude $18^\\circ 45'$ north, about 60 miles north-west from Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d, Deccan); following\nthe course of the Kanarese language to the south-east, it is found to be limited by a waving line which nearly touches Adoni, winds to the west of Gooty (G\u00fati), skirts the town of Anant\u00e1pur, and, passing through Nandidr\u00fag, touches the range of the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts; thence pursuing their southern course to the mountainous pass of Gazzalhati, it continues to follow the abrupt turn caused by the great chasm of the western hills between the towns of Coimbatore, Pol\u00e1chi, and P\u00e1lgh\u00e1t; and, sweeping to the north-west, skirts the edges of the precipitous Western Gh\u00e1ts, nearly as far north as the sources of the Kistna (Krishna); whence following first an eastern and afterwards a north-eastern course, it terminates in rather an acute angle near B\u00edd\u00e1r, already described as its northern limits.'\n\nThis country was ruled by the Chal\u00fakya, Chera, Ganga, and Pallava dynasties, till about the 10th century, when the south fell into the hands of the Chol\u00e1s, and the last three dynasties ceased to exist. The Kalach\u00far\u00eds succeeded in the north; and about the 12th century the whole was subjugated by the dynasty holding court at Dw\u00e1rasamudra, from about 1035 to 1326, when, upon being defeated by the Muhammadans, Ball\u00e1la Deva retired to Tonnur, in Mysore, where his descendants remained as feudatories of Vijayanagar. The latter dynasty, which came into power about the year 1336, and survived till 1565, conquered the whole of the Peninsula south of the Tungabhadra river. They were completely overthrown by the Muhammadans in 1565, and retired first to Pennakonda, and then to Chandragiri, one branch of the family settling at Anagundi. It was these conquests that probably led to the extension of the term Karn\u00e1tik to the southern plain country; and this latter region came to be called Karn\u00e1ta Payangh\u00e1t, or lowlands, to distinguish it from Karn\u00e1ta B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t, or the hill country. When the Muhammadan kings of the Deccan (Dakshin) ousted the Vijayanagar dynasty, they divided the north of the Vijayanagar country between them into Karn\u00e1tik Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (or Golconda) and Karn\u00e1tik Bij\u00e1pur, both being sub-divided into Payangh\u00e1t and B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t. At this time, according to Wilkes, the northern boundary of Karn\u00e1ta (Karn\u00e1tik) was the Tungabhadra.\n\nSpeaking of this period and the modern misapplication of the name, Bishop Caldwell says: 'The term Karn\u00e1ta or Karn\u00e1taka is said to have been a generic term, including both the Telugu and Kanarese peoples and their languages, though it is admitted that it usually denoted the latter alone, and though it is to the latter that the abbreviated form Kannadam has been appropriated. Karn\u00e1taka (that which belongs to Karn\u00e1ta) is regarded as a Sanskrit word by native Pandits, but I agree with Dr. Gundvet in preferring to derive it from the Dravidian words, kar, \"black,\" n\u00e1du (the adjective form of which in Telugu is n\u00e1ti), \"country,\" i.e. \"the\nblack country,\" a term very suitable to designate the \"black cotton-soil,\" as it is called, of the plateau of the Southern Dekkan. The use of the term is of considerable antiquity, as we find it in Vah\u00e1ra-mihira at the beginning of the fifth century A.D. T\u00e1ran\u00e1tha also mentions Karn\u00e1ta. The word Karn\u00e1ta or Karn\u00e1taka, though at first a generic term, became in process of time the appellation of the Kanarese people and of their language alone, to the entire exclusion of the Telugu. Karn\u00e1taka has now got into the hands of foreigners, who have given it a new and entirely erroneous application. When the Muhammadans arrived in Southern India, they found that part of it with which they first became acquainted\u2014the country above the Gh\u00e1ts, including Mysore and part of Teling\u00e1na\u2014called the Karn\u00e1taka country. In course of time, by a misapplication of terms, they applied the same name Karn\u00e1tik, or Carnatic, to designate the country below the Gh\u00e1ts, as well as that which was above. The English have carried the misapplication a step further, and restricted the name to the country below the Gh\u00e1ts, which never had any right to it whatever. Hence the Mysore country, which is properly the true Karn\u00e1tik, is no longer called by that name; and what is now geographically termed \"the Karn\u00e1tik\" is exclusively the country below the Gh\u00e1ts, on the Coromandel coast, including the whole of the Tamil country and the Telugu-speaking District of Nellore.'\u2014Caldwell's Grammar of the Dravidian Languages, pp. 34, 35.\n\nKarnpray\u00e1g.\u2014Village in Garhw\u00e1l District, North-Western Provinces; situated at the junction of the Pindar and the Alaknanda. Lat. 30\u00b0 15' N., long. 79\u00b0 14' 40\" E. Forms one of the five sacred halting-places on the pilgrimage to Him\u00e1chal. The principal temple, dedicated to Uma, one of the forms of the wife of Siva, is said to have been rebuilt by Sankara Ach\u00e1rya, the famous religious reformer of the 9th century A.D. A jh\u00fala or rope bridge formerly crossed the Pindar here, but is now superseded by an iron suspension bridge. Elevation above sea-level, 2560 feet.\n\nKarn\u00fal (Kurnoul, Karnulu, Canoul\u2014Orme; Kandan\u00fal\u2014Hamilton).\u2014British District in the Madras Presidency. Lies between 14\u00b0 54' and 16\u00b0 14' N. lat., and between 77\u00b0 46' and 79\u00b0 15' E. long. Bounded on the north by the rivers Tungabhadra and Kistna (which separate it from the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions) and by Kistna District; on the south by Cuddapah and Bellary; on the east by Nellore and Kistna; and on the west by Bellary. Area (including the petty State of Banagana-palli, q.v.), 7788 square miles. Population (1881), also including Banaganapalli, 709,305 souls. The administrative head-quarters are at Karnul town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Two long mountain ranges, the Nallamalai and the Yerramalai (Yellamalai) hills, extend in parallel lines, north and south,\nthrough the centre of the District. The Nallamalai range is about 70 miles long in Karnul, and nearly 25 miles broad in the widest parts. The principal heights are Biramkonda (3149 feet), Gundlabrahmeswaram (3055 feet), and Durgapukonda (3086 feet). There are five plateaux on this range, of which the principal is that of Gundlabrahmeswaram, 2700 feet high, reached by two paths of easy gradient. On this a bungalow has been built, but the site is unsuited for a sanitarium. The Yerramalai is a low range, generally flat-topped with scarped sides. The highest point is about 2000 feet. These two ranges divide the District into three well-defined sections. The eastern section, called the Cumbum (Kambham) valley, is about 600 feet above sea-level, and is very hilly. The Velikonda (2000 feet) range, the main edge of the Eastern Gh\u00e2ts, bounds this valley on the east. Several low ridges run parallel to the Nallamalais, broken here and there by gorges, through which mountain streams take their course. Several of these gaps were dammed across under native rule, and tanks formed, for purposes of cultivation. One of the tanks so formed is the magnificent Cumbum Tank, closed in by a dam across the Gundlakamma river. It covers an area of nearly 15 square miles, and irrigates about 6000 acres of land, yielding a revenue of nearly \u00a36000 a year. The northern part of the valley is drained by the Gundlakamma, the southern part by the Sagilair (Sagileru), a tributary of the Penner. Both these rivers rise in the Nallamalai hills.\n\nFrom the Cumbum (Kambham) valley, the Nandikanama gh\u00e2t (highest point, 2000 feet) and the Mantral Pass lead across the Nallamalais to the central division. This is a very extensive, flat, open valley, between 700 and 800 feet above sea-level, and covered with black cotton-soil. Northward, it is crossed by the watershed between the Penn\u00e4r (Ponnaiyar) and the Kistna, and it is drained by the Bhavanasi to the north and the Kundair (Kunderu) to the south. In the hot months, this plain presents an arid appearance. On the hill-sides, however, green woodlands and private gardens are seen, watered by the streams and springs which rise in the neighbouring hills. The canal of the Madras Irrigation Company is carried right down this valley. On the flank of the hills, bounded by the two valleys, stone implements were recently discovered by the geological surveyors. It has been suggested that the people who used them lived on these hills when the valleys were still under water.\n\nThe western division differs in its features from the other two. It forms the northern end of the eastern edge of the Mysore Plateau; and lies 900 feet above the sea at Karnul town, on its northern extremity, and 1700 feet at Peapalli, 4 miles north of its southern limits. It is dotted with bare rocky hills and long ridges, and is drained from south to north by the Hindri, which falls into the Tungabhadra at Karnul.\nRivers.\u2014The principal rivers are the Tungabhadra and the Kistna, which bound the District on the north. When in flood, the Tungabhadra averages 900 yards broad and 15 feet deep. It is usually crossed by means of basket boats, some of which are of large size. In 1860, an anicut or weir was built across the river at Sunkesala, 18 miles above Karnul town, and a canal dug for the double purpose of irrigation and navigation. After the floods subside, a fine description of melon is grown in the river-bed. Small communities of fishermen, who monopolize the ferrying trade, live in villages on the banks of the river, but they complain that since the construction of the anicut, the fishing industry has fallen off considerably. The Kistna in Karnul District flows chiefly through uninhabited jungles, sometimes in long smooth reaches, with intervening shingly rapids. The average fall of the river is about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ feet per mile above the junction and 4 feet below it; the depth in high flood varies from 25 to 40 feet. The Bhavanasi, which rises in the Nallamalai hills, drains the northern part of the watershed, and falls into the Kistna at Sangameswaram, a place of pilgrimage. Below their junction is a whirlpool (chakratirtam) which is regarded as holy by the native pilgrims. The Kunderu, a rapid stream, rises on the western Yerramalais. Winding round the hills, it drains the central valley and falls into the Pennar. The Gundlakamma rises in the Nallamalais, and, after receiving two other mountain torrents, passes through the Cumbum gorge, where it is formed into a tank. Emerging again from the tank, and obstructed in its easterly course by the base of the Velikonda range, it makes a remarkable curve towards the north, and flows through Kistna and Nellore Districts to the sea. It is rapid, deep, and erosive, often injuring the wells on its banks, and has a minimum flow of 800 cubic feet of water per second. The Gundlakamma and the Sagileru are utilized for cultivation by means of rough low dams thrown across them. In the Bhavanasi, temporary dams are constructed every year.\n\nGeology.\u2014The rocks of the District belong to three different formations, corresponding to its three great physical divisions. In the Kunderu valley or Karnul formation, shales, limestones, and quartzites are the prevailing rocks. The limestone makes very good building material, and resembles the Nigr\u00ed stone, with which many of the railway stations are built. The limestone found near Karnul is used for lithographic purposes. Nearly the whole of the Kunderu valley, including the Nandikotk\u00far t\u00e1luk at its head, the lands on the banks of the Hindri, and about one-fifth of the Cumbum valley on the banks of the Gundlakamma and Sagileru, are covered with black cotton-soil. The minerals found in Karnul District are diamonds, steatite, iron, lead, copper. Running from the Nallamalais and Yerramalais are several hot springs, of which the Mah\u00e1nandi and the Kalwa Buggas are sufficiently\ncopious to irrigate a good deal of land. There were in 1882-83, 116 mines and quarries in the District; annual value of out-turn, about \u00a32100.\n\nForests.\u2014There are three recognised forest divisions in the District\u2014the Nallamalai, the Vellikonda, and the Yerramalai. The first two are conserved by the Forest Department, and yield a revenue which in 1875-76 amounted to \u00a32700. The Nallamalais are said to contain the finest forests on the eastern side of the Presidency, covering an area of about 2000 square miles. The chief timber-trees found here are teak (Tectona grandis), nallamada (Avicennia officinalis), and yepi (Hardwickia binata). The jungles on the western slope are tolerably thick, but those on the eastern flank are thin and poor. In the northern parts, where the jungle is poor, there are extensive grassy level lands, which afford pasture to numerous herds of cattle from Nellore and Kistna Districts. The grazing lands are annually let for about \u00a370 or \u00a380. The Yerramalai hills are generally bare of trees on their flat tops, but their slopes and the plains below are clothed with shrubs of all kinds and some stunted trees, but no valuable timber. These jungles are in charge of the Collector, and yielded a revenue in 1875-76 of \u00a3518. This revenue is constituted into a local fund, and spent on works of public utility, such as planting groves, sinking wells, etc. The jungle products\u2014found chiefly in the Nallamalai forest\u2014are gall-nuts, honey, wax, tamarinds, stick-lac, and bamboo rice.\n\nWild Animals.\u2014Tigers are not numerous in the Nallamalai hills, but they are remarkably addicted to man-eating. Occasionally a tiger is known to stray into the plains. In 1867, a man-eater infested the Nandikanama Pass, and a reward of \u00a3100 was offered for its death. The animal was at last killed; but it was soon found that it was not the only one that did the mischief. The usual reward, \u00a33, 10s., for killing tigers was raised to \u00a330. Since then their numbers have been considerable lessened, and the reward has now been reduced to \u00a310. The other animals of the District include leopards, wolves, hyenas, foxes, jackals, etc. No bears or chit\u00e1s (Felis jubata) are found. The number of deaths caused by wild beasts between 1867 and 1875 was 163, of which 64 occurred in 1867. The average amount spent in rewards for the destruction of wild beasts is \u00a3250 a year. Spotted deer, and several varieties of antelopes, are found on the mountains. Bison have been seen in the northern Nallamalais. Porcupines and hogs abound in the jungles, and commit depredations on the crops. The Indian antelope abounds on the plains, and the gazelle (Gazella bennettii) on the low rocky hills. Feathered game of many kinds is abundant: pea-fowl, jungle-fowl, the spangled and red varieties of spur-fowl, painted and grey partridges, florican, duck, snipe, plovers, curlew\nof many varieties, and quail. In the Tungabhadra and the deeper reaches of the Kistna, the mah\u00e1sir, sable, etc., attain considerable size. A mah\u00e1sir brought before Dr. Day, when he visited Karn\u00fal, weighed 38 lbs., and another was stated to weigh 50 or 60 lbs. No revenue is derived from fisheries. Snakes, chiefly cobras, abound. Formerly, small rewards were given for the destruction of snakes, but this practice has been discontinued. Tiger, leopard, and deer skins, and antelope horns, are sold in small quantities.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The regular Census of 1871 returned a total of 959,640 inhabitants; that of 1881 a total of 709,305, namely, 359,354 males and 349,951 females. The decrease since 1871 of 250,335, or 26\u00b709 per cent., is attributable to the famine which devastated Southern India in 1876\u201378. Karn\u00fal was in the heart of the famine zone. Always a poor, thinly-populated District, remote from the great centres of trade and from railway communication, it was the most difficult tract to relieve with imported food. The decrease in population after the famine, in the different t\u00e1luks, varied from 9\u00b730 per cent. in M\u00e1rkapur to 39\u00b721 per cent. in Pattikonda. The area of the District is returned at 7788 square miles; density of population, 91 persons per square mile. Number of towns, 3; villages, 833; occupied houses, 149,194; unoccupied houses, 26,805; villages per square mile, 0\u00b71; persons per occupied house, 4\u00b78.\n\nIn 1881, the Hindus numbered 615,992, or 86\u00b784 per cent. of the total population; Muhammadans, 81,827, or 11\u00b754 per cent.; Christians, 11,464, or 1\u00b762 per cent.; Jains, 6; and \u2018others,\u2019 16. Among high-caste Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans numbered 18,843; Kshattriy\u00e1s, 2898; and Chettis (merchants and traders), 31,564. The intermediate class include\u2014Vall\u00e1las or K\u00e1pus (agriculturists), 192,086; Idaiyars (shepherds), 71,911; Vann\u00e1ns (washermen), 19,629; Ambattans (barbers), 10,859; Kushavans (potters), 9958; Kamm\u00e1lars (artisans), 9895. The most numerous of the lower castes are the Shembadavans, who number 66,705, and are fishermen, hunters, and palanquin-bearers; their women sell jungle fruits. Kaikalars (weavers) numbered 15,122; and Sh\u00e1n\u00e1ns (toddy-drawers), 10,593. Pariahs or outcastes numbered 95,969. Of the Muhammadans, 74,395 were Sunnis, 1005 Shi\u00e1s, 4 Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, and 6423 unspecified.\n\nThe Christian population in 1881 was 11,464, or almost exactly three times the number returned in 1871. Protestants, undistinguished by sect, numbered 7256. Adherents of the Church of England were returned at 727; Baptists, 736; Roman Catholics, 1015; Congregationalists, 21; Independents, 2; and unspecified, 1698.\n\nThe Catholics, whose principal station is at Pol\u00far, originally belonged to the K\u00e1pu or cultivating caste, and their conversion to Christianity has not made any material change in their manners and customs. They\neat and drink with Hindus, and in several cases intermarry with them. They have founded a village named Kothala, and are generally well off. The Protestant stations are Nandi\u00e1l, Muthialp\u00e1d, and Karn\u00fal. The former two were founded in 1855, and the last (Baptist Mission) in 1876. The Protestant converts are almost entirely low-caste natives in rural tracts.\n\nClassified according to occupation, the Census of 1881 distributes the adult male population into six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every description and the learned professions, 10,036; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 2346; (3) commercial class, including merchants, bankers, carriers, etc., 11,339; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 153,318; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 52,184; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 130,131. About 54 per cent. of the total population are returned as 'workers,' on whom the remaining 46 per cent. depend. Of the males 68'43 per cent., and of the females 39'46 per cent., are 'workers.' The language of the District is Telugu. In Pattikonda taluk, a large number speak Kanarese.\n\nThe wild tribes or Chenchus live on the Nallamalai hills, in small communities called gudem. Each gudem includes several tribes, and has a portion of the hills allotted to it by common consent. The Chenchus do not transfer their rights to the hill produce to each other, but occasionally give a portion as dowry to their daughters. They are unwilling to cultivate, but are sometimes employed by the villagers in the plains to watch their fields during the harvest. In former times they were allowed a kind of black-mail; but since the introduction of the police force, this has been discontinued, and some of them are employed as gh\u00e1t talari\u015b or road watchmen. During the hill festival they collect fees from pilgrims. Some of them also enjoy in\u00e1ms (free lands) for guarding the jungles. Their language is chiefly a patois of Telugu.\n\nOf the 836 towns and villages in the District, 84 contained in 1881 a population less than two hundred; 207 contained between two and five hundred; 314 between five hundred and one thousand; 189 between one and two thousand; 28 between two and three thousand; 10 between three and five thousand; 3 between five and ten thousand; and 1 between twenty and fifty thousand.\n\nThe principal towns are\u2014KARNUL (population 20,329), NANDIAL (8907), CUMBUM (7170), GUDUR (3547), MADDIKERA (6181), KODUMUR (3736), and PEPALI (3535).\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The chief crops grown in Karn\u00fal are\u2014millets, pulse, cotton, oil-producing plants, and indigo. Crops artificially irrigated\noccupy comparatively but a small area; they consist mainly of rice and sugar-cane. Wheat and flax are grown on an insignificant scale. Tobacco, chillies, plantains, areca-nut palms, etc., are raised in the immediate neighbourhood of villages. The staple of the District is cholam (Sorghum vulgare), of which the principal varieties are the yellow and white jonna. The yellow jonna is the early crop, and is sown early in June, on red as well as on black soil. The white jonna, the later crop, is sown in September or October, and reaped in February and March. No improvement has taken place in the mode of cultivation or in the quality of produce, but within the last twenty years there has been a very great extension of the area under the principal crops. Cotton is largely cultivated, but there has been no consequent decrease in the cultivation of food-grains; other fibres are cultivated only to a small extent for home consumption.\n\nThe total area of the District is 4,497,011 acres. Of these, 1,635,566 acres were under cultivation in 1882-83; 5106 acres bearing two crops. Of the area under cultivation, 43,452 acres were artificially irrigated, and 1,592,114 acres unirrigated. Area cultivable but waste, 973,506 acres; pasture and forest land, 322,526 acres; barren land, 1,570,519 acres. In\u00e1m or rent-free grants covered an area of 991,472 acres. Cholam occupied 626,699 acres, or 38 per cent. of the total cultivated area; khoda (Panicum miliaceum), 131,838 acres; samai (Panicum miliare), 17,640 acres; r\u00e1g\u00ed (Eleusine corocana), 13,668 acres; other millets, 307,099 acres; rice, 51,281 acres; wheat, 5753 acres; and maize, 190 acres; pulses, 84,221; garden produce, 2915; drugs and narcotics, 5509; chillies, 8509; onions and spices, 481; sugar-cane, 641; gingelly, 3252; castor-oil, 55,799; linseed, 3019; indigo, 103,377; cotton, 212,585; and jute, 382 acres.\n\nA second crop is obtained only from certain lands and in exceptional cases. It may be taken as three-fourths of the first crop in quantity, and considerably less than three-fourths in value. The r\u00e1yats, as a rule, cultivate their own lands. Owners of very large holdings sublet some of their fields and employ labourers on others. The average annual assessment, including local rates and cesses levied on land, is 1s. 10\u00bdd. per acre. The wages of agricultural day-labourers and artisans are usually paid in kind. When paid in cash, coolies or unskilled labourers receive from 5\u00bed. to 7\u00bdd. a day; blacksmiths, bricklayers, and carpenters, 1s. to 1s. 4d.\n\nThe prices of produce in 1882-83 were as follows:\u2014Per maund of 80 lbs.\u2014rice, 6s. 2d.; r\u00e1g\u00ed, 2s. 2\u00bdd.; millets, 2s. 4d.; wheat, 5s. 4\u00bdd.; salt, 6s. 1\u00bcd.; sugar, \u00a31, 4s. 4d.; linseed oil, 6s. 10\u00bdd.; cotton, \u00a31, 8s. 4\u00bdd.; indigo, \u00a315, 8s. A sheep costs 4s. 2d.; a plough bullock, about \u00a34, 13s. Camels can be hired at 2s. a day; draught bullocks, 1s. 5d.; horses, 1s. 10d.; ponies, 1s. 1d.; and carts, 5\u00bdd.\nTenures.\u2014The land tenures of the District are:\u2014(1) R\u00e1yatw\u00e1ri, i.e. land held direct from Government. (2) J\u00e1gir and Shrotriam, or villages granted to individuals by former governments. (3) Minor in\u00e1m\u2014lands held rent-free or at favourable rates for personal benefit. If the in\u00e1m is unenfranchised, it is liable to revert to Government on failure of lineal heirs. (4) Service in\u00e1m, granted for the support of temples and mosques, or for the benefit of the village community, either rent-free or subject to the payment of a small quit-rent. (5) Joint tenure. Shrotriam villages are generally held in coparcenary. In such cases the r\u00e1yats have rights of occupancy, and cannot be ejected unless they fail to pay the rent, which may be either a share of the produce, a fixed quantity of grain, or a money payment. (6) Dasabandham\u2014land held on condition of repairing irrigation works, for which the owner is allowed a specified quantity of land or a reduction averaging one-fourth of his assessment.\n\nThere is not much waste land in the plains, but there is a good deal in the Nallamalai range, which was cultivated in ancient times, but is now overgrown with jungle. In 1854, Captain Nelson of the Madras Invalid Corps settled here to restore a large ruined tank and reclaim the jungle; but after several years\u2019 residence, he gave up the attempt. Manure is chiefly used for garden and \u2018wet\u2019 crops; but to the west of the Nallamal\u00e1is, \u2018dry\u2019 lands are also largely manured. Lands on which rice, sugar-cane, areca-nut, saffron, r\u00e1g\u00ed, tobacco, and chillies are grown, are irrigated from tanks and wells. Poorer lands are left fallow for purposes of pasture, and are charged the usual assessment, except in villages where they have been abandoned by common consent. Rotation of crops is well known in the District.\n\nThe main canal of the Madras Irrigation Company, intended for the double purpose of irrigation and navigation, runs from Sunkesala to Cuddapah, total length 189 miles; length within the limits of Karn\u00fal District, 140 miles. The nominal width of the canal is 60 yards, and the depth of water 8 feet. The water-rate charged for rice is about 12s. per acre, and less for other crops according to the length of time for which water is taken. The area accessible to the waters of this canal in Karn\u00fal District is estimated at 284,206 acres. The canal was transferred to Government on the 6th July 1882. The total area irrigated in 1883\u201384 was 19,674 acres, against 17,834 acres in 1882\u201383, and the revenue derived from irrigation amounted to \u00a36795, against \u00a35926 in the previous year. The navigation receipts in 1882\u201383 amounted to \u00a31068; in 1883\u201384, owing to a breach, traffic was partially suspended, and remission of rent to the leaseholders of boats was granted. Arrangements were being made in 1883\u201384 for providing distributaries required for the extension of irrigation.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The villages on the banks of the rivers Tunga-\nbhadra and Kistna are occasionally flooded, the most disastrous recent instance being in 1851, when the crops of some villages and the buildings in the lower part of Karn\u00fal town were injured. This inundation was due to a heavy rainfall at the head-waters and within the District. Both Karn\u00fal and the neighbouring District of Bellary suffer from droughts at periodic intervals; and the mass of the population being small landowners, with no reserve capital, the failure of a single monsoon involves general distress. There is no record of the earlier famines; but 1804, 1810, 1824, 1833, 1854, 1866, 1876, and 1877 were all years of drought and consequent scarcity. In 1854, the price of cholam rose to \u00a319 per 3200 Madras measures, against \u00a39, 10s. in the previous year. In Karn\u00fal, the season of 1866 was not so bad as in Bellary; but owing to exportation, prices rose very high, cholam selling at $8\\frac{1}{2}$ measures (about 24 lbs.) per rupee, or three times the normal rate.\n\nIn 1876 both the monsoons failed. The floods of 1874 had seriously injured the tanks and the crops, while the harvest in 1875 was but partial. Prices rose from 18 measures (about 50 lbs.) a rupee in July, the sowing season, to 12 measures or 33 lbs. a rupee in September or October, the period at which the principal crop is generally harvested; and to 6 measures (famine rates) in February and March (1877), when the later crop is usually cut. In July the price was 3 measures, or about 8 lbs., for the rupee (2s.). The roads were fortunately all in good order; much grain was imported both by the Government, as a reserve, and by private merchants, from Gooty (G\u00fati) and Adoni, the nearest railway stations. There was no difficulty in procuring carts sufficient to carry into the interior all the grain that the railway could bring from the coast; but this quantity was not equal to the demand, even at famine rates.\n\nKarn\u00fal was beyond question the worst of the famine-stricken Districts in the Madras Presidency. Relief works were set on foot in all parts of the District. The number of persons gratuitously fed in April 1877 was 44,887. Up to the end of July, nearly \u00a3600,000 was spent on famine relief in this District alone. Notwithstanding these efforts, the effects of the famine were appalling. The number of deaths recorded from 1st October 1876 to 30th June 1877, was 48,000, as compared with 19,974 in the corresponding period of the previous year; and it is certain that with a system of collecting vital statistics, which even in ordinary years is admittedly defective, these figures fail to represent the excessive mortality of that direful period. All fodder and pasturage having failed, large numbers of cattle were driven to the Nallamalai hills for grazing, but the mountain grass was soon exhausted. The poorer r\u0101yats lost all their cattle, while the rich were scarcely able to save one-quarter of their herds. When at last the south-west monsoon\nof 1877 broke in November, the few cart-cattle that survived were sent to field-work, and famine labourers drew the grain carts. This, however, did not last long. The rains ceased prematurely, prices rose once more, and famine recurred with the same severity as before; it was not till the end of 1878 that cultivation was practicable. The mortality caused by starvation, and the diseases incident thereto, will never be known. But the Census Report shows a decrease of population in Karn\u00fal District between 1871 and 1881 of 250,339 souls, or 26\u00b79 per cent., a greatly higher proportionate loss than in any other of the Madras famine-stricken Districts, Bellary coming next with a decrease of 19\u00b786 per cent.\n\n**Industries.**\u2014The chief manufacture in Karn\u00fal is weaving, which in 1881 gave employment to 15,122 persons, exclusive of women. The weavers conduct the manufacture in their own houses, partly on their own account, and partly for traders who advance money. Iron and steel are worked at the foot of the Nallamalai hills. Of late years this industry has greatly diminished, native iron being superseded for agricultural implements by imported iron. Diamond mines have been worked from early times in the quartzite beds of the Yerramalai hills, which are now leased by Government for about \u00a320 a year. Quarrying stones is an important industry. Indigo and jaggery or country sugar are also manufactured. Weekly markets are held in most of the towns and important villages. One of the market rules relating to cotton twist, the chief article of sale in these fairs, is worth mention. When a twist is found to contain a less number of threads than the prescribed number, it is broken up by the people and thrown over trees. This summary vindication of commercial morality is sanctioned by custom, and is never appealed against.\n\n**Commerce.**\u2014There is little or no export of grain. Salt is imported from the eastern coast, but earth salt is largely manufactured. Cotton, indigo, tobacco, and hides, as well as cotton carpets and cotton cloth, are the chief exports. European piece-goods, areca-nut, cocoa-nut, and various dry condiments required for native households, are the chief imports.\n\n**Roads.**\u2014In 1882, there were 603 miles of made roads in the District, 8 miles of railroad, and 140 miles of navigable canal.\n\n**History.**\u2014From local records, it appears that Karn\u00fal formed part of the old Teling\u00e1na kingdom of Warangul. On the downfall of that dynasty, Karn\u00fal seems to have became an independent principality. According to Wilson, a prince of Karn\u00fal (Narasinha R\u00e1o, son of Iswara R\u00e1o) was adopted into the family of Vijayanagar, and afterwards raised to the throne of that mighty kingdom. There can, however, be no doubt that Karn\u00fal formed part of the kingdom of Vijayanagar. In the reign of Achy\u00fata Dev\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1, the fort of Karn\u00fal\nwas built, and the country was conferred in j\u00e1g\u00edr on a relative named R\u00e1mr\u00e1j\u00e1. After the battle of T\u00e1l\u00edkot in 1564, in which the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Vijayanagar was defeated by the allied Muhammadan kings of Bij\u00e1pur, Golconda, and Ahmadnagar, Karn\u00fal became a province of Bij\u00e1pur. The first Sub\u00e1hd\u00e1r was an Abyssinian named Abd\u00fal Wah\u00e1b, who converted the Hindu temples into mosques, and built a fine dome-shaped tomb in imitation of the one at Bij\u00e1pur.\n\nIn 1651, after the conquest of Bij\u00e1pur by Aurangzeb, Karn\u00fal was conferred by him upon a Path\u00e1n named Kiz\u00edr Kh\u00e1n in reward for military services. Kiz\u00edr Kh\u00e1n was assassinated by his son D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n; and on his death his two brothers, Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Kh\u00e1n and Al\u00edf Kh\u00e1n, ruled the country jointly for six years, after which they were succeeded by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Kh\u00e1n, the son of Al\u00edf Kh\u00e1n, who built and strengthened the fort. The country then peaceably descended to his son and grandson. The grandson, H\u00edmmat Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur, accompanied Naz\u00edr Jang, the Niz\u00e1m of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d), in his expedition to the Karn\u00e1tik along with the Naw\u00e1bs of Cuddapah and Savan\u00far. Naz\u00edr Jang was there treacherously murdered by the Naw\u00e1b of Cuddapah, and his nephew was made Sub\u00e1hd\u00e1r of the Deccan. But the new Sub\u00e1hd\u00e1r failed to satisfy the expectations of the Path\u00e1n Naw\u00e1bs, who had hoped for an extension of their territory. He was murdered at Rachoti in Cuddapah by H\u00edmmat Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur, who was himself cut to pieces by the infuriated soldiers. Sal\u00e1bat Jang, a nephew of Naz\u00edr Jang, was then made Sub\u00e1hd\u00e1r; and on his way back to Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d with Bussy, assaulted Karn\u00fal, and took it in 1752. But he afterwards restored the j\u00e1g\u00edr for a sum of money to Mun\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n, brother of H\u00edmmat Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur. A short time afterwards, Haidar Al\u00ed overran Karn\u00fal, and exacted a contribution of 2 l\u00e1khs of Gadval rupees.\n\nIn 1800, this District, together with Cuddapah and Bellary, was ceded to the British Government. From that time, the yearly tribute, reduced to 1 l\u00e1kh of Gadval rupees, was punctually paid by Al\u00edf Kh\u00e1n to the British Government. In 1815, Al\u00edf Kh\u00e1n died, and his younger son, Muzaffar Jang, usurped the throne and seized the fort. Mun\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n, the eldest son, applied to the English for assistance; troops were sent from Bellary under Colonel Mariott, Muzaffar Jang was expelled, and Mun\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n placed on the masnad. On his death without heirs in 1823, his brother Muzaffar should have succeeded; but as he was on his way to Karn\u00fal, within the limits of Bellary District, he murdered his wife, and was imprisoned in the Bellary fort, where he died in 1879.\n\nIn 1838, information reached Government that the Naw\u00e1b was engaged in treasonable preparations on an extensive scale. An inquiry showed that enormous quantities of arms and ammunition were stored in the fort and palace, for which no satisfactory explanation\ncould be given. The town and fort were captured after a sharp fight, and the Naw\u00e1b escaped to Zor\u00e1pur, a small village on the east bank of the Hindri. His foreign soldiers would not allow him to depart until their arrears of pay were satisfied. The Naw\u00e1b then yielded himself prisoner, and was sent to Trichinopoli, where he was basely murdered by one of his own servants, whom he had charged with a petty theft. His territories, as well as the minor j\u00e1girs enjoyed by his relatives, were confiscated, and all the members of the family pensioned. After the resumption, the country was for a time administered by a Commissioner, and then by an Agent till 1858. In that year Karn\u00fal was constituted a separate Collectorate, with the addition of certain tracts from Cuddapah and Bellary.\n\nRevenue History.\u2014Under native government, the lands were rented by paleg\u00e1rs, or hereditary barons, who paid a peshkash, and sometimes rendered military service. On the transfer of Cuddapah and Bellary, which then included the present Karn\u00fal District, to the Company in 1800, the paleg\u00e1rs were summoned by Major (afterwards Sir) Thomas Munro to make their settlements, but many of them refused to attend, and proved troublesome. The lands were therefore resumed, and the paleg\u00e1rs pensioned. The country was then settled on a quasi-r\u00e1yatw\u00e1ri system, but the rates were fixed with reference to the high assessment levied under Musalm\u00e1n government. This system was tried till 1807, when it was superseded by a triennial, and afterwards by a decennial settlement. The assessment was collected through farmers or middlemen, who fell largely into arrears, and several of them were sent to jail. The renting system was thereupon discontinued; and in 1821 the r\u00e1yatw\u00e1ri system was reverted to, but with a reduction in the rates of 25 per cent. on \u2018dry\u2019 and \u2018wet,\u2019 and 32 per cent. on garden lands. Since then no important changes have occurred, except that lands under wells and tanks constructed at private expense have been exempted from extra assessment, and that old well-land (or garden) rates have been assimilated to \u2018dry\u2019 rates.\n\nIn Karn\u00fal Proper, the revenue administration under the Naw\u00e1bs was conducted without system. The old pal\u00edyams and zamind\u00e1ris were arbitrarily resumed, and villages were rented to the head-men, who distributed lands among the r\u00e1yats according to their means, and raised or lowered rents at pleasure. In the first four years of British rule in this part of the District, the revenue decreased by about 1\u00bd lakh. The Agent proposed to revert to village rents, but the Government negatived the proposal. In the next four years, the revenue rose again to its former level. Where the rates were too high, they were reduced, or unassessed lands were given at lower rates to compensate for over-assessment on old lands, and in some cases remissions were also made, and the tax on special products was abolished, but the high rates on\ngarden and ordinary lands were retained. Prices, however, began to rise, and afforded to the r\u0101yats a more certain relief than any reduction in the assessment could give, and saved the necessity for temporary remissions. The latter were accordingly abolished, and the revenue gradually increased. The remaining inequalities of the old rough settlement were finally removed by the new Survey and Settlement in 1866.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total gross revenue of Karn\u016bl District in 1882-83 amounted to \u00a3158,375, of which \u00a3130,480 was derived from land. The expenditure on the civil and police administration is returned at \u00a346,881. The District administration is carried on by 38 high officials, including a District Judge, with 3 subordinate munsifs for civil jurisdiction; a District Magistrate, with 17 subordinates for criminal cases; and 13 revenue officers. The total police force of the District in 1882-83 was 927 men, maintained at a cost of \u00a314,729; proportion of police to area of District, 8\u00b76 per square mile; of police to population, 1 to 782. The District contains a District jail and 13 subsidiary prisons. Daily average prison population, 90 prisoners.\n\nEducation.\u2014The state of education in Karn\u016bl is backward; only 3\u00b77 per cent. of the population in 1871 being returned as able to read and write. In 1882, there were altogether 404 schools, with 6501 pupils. Girls\u2019 schools numbered 3, with 76 pupils. Pupils in primary vernacular schools numbered 5596, under Government inspection. The Census Report of 1881 returned a total of 6687 boys and 411 girls as under instruction, besides 26,094 males and 1401 females able to read and write, but not under instruction.\n\nMedical Aspect.\u2014The climate of Karn\u016bl is on the whole healthy. The prevailing winds are west and north-east, and the mean temperature is about 85\u00b0 F. The rains begin in June, and continue up to September. The total annual fall is 48 inches. In the villages along the foot of the Nallamalais, a severe type of fever prevails, accompanied by enlargement of the spleen. Other common diseases are rheumatic affections, conjunctivitis, and dysentery. Murrain and \u2018foot-and-mouth disease\u2019 are very prevalent among cattle. There is very little or no pasture land in the plains, and the cattle are generally grazed on the hills; but during the hot months the hill grass is burnt up, and the difficulty of feeding cattle becomes very great. In 1882, the registered death-rate per thousand was 15\u00b75, and the registered birth-rate per thousand, 28. There are three dispensaries in the District\u2014at Cumbum, Karn\u016bl, and Nandi\u0101l. Total of persons treated during 1881, 38,354. [For further information regarding Karn\u016bl, see Mr. Stack\u2019s Memorandum upon the Current Land Settlement in the temporarily settled parts of British India, p. 371. Also the Madras\nKarn\u00fal (Karnaoul; Kandanul; Canoul of Orme).\u2014Town and municipality in Ramalkota taluk or Sub-division of Karn\u00fal District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 15\u00b0 49' 58\" N., long. 78\u00b0 5' 29\" E. Population (1871) 25,579; (1881) 20,329, namely, 9637 males and 10,692 females. Number of houses, 5391. Hindus numbered 9995; Muhammadans, 10,007; Christians, 320; and 'others,' 7. The head-quarters of the District, with a Judge, Collector-Magistrate, and the usual District courts.\n\nThe town stands on a rocky spit of land (an island since the construction of a canal in 1865), at the junction of the Hindri and Tungabhadra rivers. The fort, whose erection is attributed to Gop\u00e1l R\u00e1ya, was dismantled in 1865; the curtain was razed, but the four bastions and three of the gates still stand. Until 1871, troops were stationed in the fort, which also contained the palace of the Naw\u00e1bs; it is still the residence of some of the members of the family. The mausoleum of Abd\u00fal Wahab (the first Naw\u00e1b of Karn\u00fal), a modern fountain presented by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Vizian\u00e1garam, and some mosques, are the only other architectural features of the place. Karn\u00fal at one time had an evil fame for cholera. But the municipality, which spends large sums yearly on sanitation, etc., has done much to redeem the reputation of the place. The town, however, has been much afflicted by endemic fever since the construction of the canal; this evil is probably to a great degree incurable, but it is aggravated by a faulty system of water-supply. In the famine of 1877\u201378, Karn\u00fal and the surrounding country suffered terribly, owing to their isolated position. The nearest railway station is Gooty (a station on the north-west line of the Madras Railway), 60 miles distant; and it was only by extraordinary efforts that food was thrown into the town.\n\nThe population is half Hindu and half Musalm\u00e1n; this unusual proportion marking the long rule of the Path\u00e1n Naw\u00e1bs. The income of the municipality from taxation in 1883\u201384 was \u00a31839; incidence of direct taxation, excluding tolls, 1s. 2d. per head.\n\nK\u00e1ro, North.\u2014River of Bengal, tributary of the South Koel river; rises in Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District, Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, drains the north-west corner of Singbh\u00fam, and finally empties itself into the South Koel.\n\nK\u00e1ro, South.\u2014Also a tributary of the South Koel; rises in the tributary State of G\u00e1ngpur, in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, crosses the north-west corner of the Orissa State of Keunjhar, then turns north draining part of Sarand\u00e1 in Singbh\u00fam, and falls into the Koel at Arandpur.\n\nK\u00e1rol.\u2014Petty State of the Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r Division of K\u00e1thiaw\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency, consisting of 2 villages, with two separate shareholders. Area of the petty State, 11 square miles, and population (1881) 1325.\nEstimated revenue in 1881, \u00a3618; tribute of \u00a370, 6s. is payable to the British Government, and \u00a39, 6s. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh. K\u00e1rol village is situated 5 miles east of Chura station on the Bhaunagar-Gondal Railway.\n\nKarond (or K\u00e1l\u00e1handi).\u2014A feudatory chiefship attached to Sambalpur District, Central Provinces; lying between 19\u00b0 5' and 20\u00b0 30' N. lat., and between 82\u00b0 40' and 83\u00b0 50' E. long. Bounded on the north by Patn\u00e1 State; on the east and south by Jaipur (Jeypore) estate and Vizagapatam District in Madras; and on the west by Bindra Naw\u00e1g\u00e1rh and Khariar. Area, 3745 square miles; number of villages, 2461; houses, 53,527. Total population in 1881, 224,548, namely, males 116,918, and females 107,630. Average density, 60 persons per square mile. The population is largely composed of aboriginal Kandhs. Of the 2461 villages, 2439 contain less than five hundred inhabitants, 19 between five hundred and a thousand, and 3 upwards of a thousand. The chief place is Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed-patn\u00e1, with a population of 3483.\n\nThe country is high, lying behind the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts, spurs from which project into Karond; while even the plains are intersected by ranges of hills. The light alluvial soil washed from their slopes is fertile and easily tilled, yielding heavy crops of almost every description. Teak is found to the north-west; and in the south, forests of sar\u00e1i and other trees clothe the heights; but in many parts the d\u00e1hya or nomadic system of tillage has cleared the timber away. The State is well watered. Within its limits rise the Indravat\u00ed, a tributary of the God\u00e1vari; the Hatti and the Ret, tributaries of the Tel; while it is traversed throughout by the Tel, the S\u00e1n, and the Ra\u00fal, which after uniting their waters, fall into the Mah\u00e1nadi beyond the limits of Karond.\n\nPrincipal crops\u2014rice, pulses, oil-seeds, sugar-cane, cotton, and the lesser millets. Of late years, wheat has been introduced, and the cultivation of the poppy has been abandoned. Oranges of fine quality are also grown. Communication has considerably improved of late years, and weekly markets have been established at the principal places; that at the chief town of Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed-patn\u00e1 being especially flourishing. Communication has been opened with R\u00e1ipur and Sambalpur by roads, which are traversed by carts in the dry season. The imports are salt, tobacco, cloth, and brass utensils; the exports consisting of grain, which is conveyed chiefly to Vizagapatam on pack bullocks. The people are fairly prosperous.\n\nThe late R\u00e1j\u00e1, Udit Pr\u00e1t\u00e1p Deo, a R\u00e1jput by caste, accompanied the Chief Commissioner to the imperial assemblage at Delhi, and obtained the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bah\u00e1dur, with a salute of 9 guns as a personal distinction. Udit Pr\u00e1t\u00e1p Deo died in 1881, and was succeeded by his adopted son, the present (1884) R\u00e1j\u00e1, Raghu Kishore Deo, a\nminor, now being educated at the R\u00e1jkumar College at Jabalpur. The administration of the State was entrusted to the late chief's senior R\u00e1n\u00ed. Shortly after these arrangements had been made, symptoms of disaffection began to show themselves amongst the Kandhs, an aboriginal tribe, consisting of about one-third of the whole population of the State. They rose against the Kult\u00e1s, a Hindu agricultural caste, murdered between 70 and 80 of them, and plundered several of their villages. This outbreak necessitated the interference of the British Government. The disturbance was quelled by an armed police force under British officers, and seven of the ringleaders on conviction were summarily executed. The State was then taken under direct Government management, and will remain so until the young chief attains his majority.\n\nThe climate of Karond is in general good. The proximity of the gh\u00e1ts ensures a regular and abundant rainfall. The gross revenue is estimated to amount to \u00a310,000; tribute of \u00a3360 is payable to the British Government.\n\nKaror.\u2014Head-quarters tahsil of Bareli (Bareilly) District, North-Western Provinces, including Bareli city. Area, 330 square miles, of which 237 are cultivated. Population (1872) 279,774; (1882) 285,731, namely, males 152,341, and females 133,390, residing in 408 villages. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 192,890; Muhammadans, 90,251; and 'others,' 2590.\n\nWheat and gram occupy about four-fifths of the area of the spring (rabi) harvest. For the autumn (khar\u00edf) harvest, b\u00e1jra, or great millet, grown on the sandy uplands, covers more than twice as much ground as any other crop. Rice, millet, sugar-cane, and joiir follow next in order. Sugar-refining is largely carried on, and forms an important industry. After supplying local wants, the surplus produce finds a sale at Bareli town and several villages where weekly markets are held. The tahsil is amply provided with means of export. Bareli city is the centre from which branches of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway radiate west to Chandausi, south-east to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, north-east to Pil\u00edbh\u00edt, and north to Katgodam (for Naini T\u00e1l). Metalled and unmetalled roads intersect the tahsil in every direction, converging on Bareli town, besides minor tracks connecting the villages. K\u00farm\u00eds and Kis\u00e1ns constitute the bulk of the cultivating class. Of 554 estates which existed at the time of settlement, 334 were held in zamind\u00e1ri tenure. By far the greater part of the cultivated area is held by tenants with rights of occupancy. Land revenue (1882), \u00a324,073; total Government revenue, \u00a327,287; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a345,048. The administrative staff consists of 1 Judge, 2 sub-Judges, and 3 muns\u00edfs in Bareli city; a District Sessions Judge, Magistrate-Collector, Joint-Magistrate, 3 Deputy Collectors,\na tahsild\u00e1r, and a cantonment magistrate. These officers preside over 5 civil and 8 criminal courts. The tahsil contains 7 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), a regular police force of 397 officers and men, and a village police (chaukid\u00e1rs) numbering 356.\n\nKaror.\u2014Town in the Leiah tahsil of Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n District, Punjab. Lat. 31\u00b0 13' 30\" N., long. 70\u00b0 59' 15\" E. Population (1868) 5720. By 1881 it had decreased to 2723, namely, 1459 Hindus, 1263 Muhammadans, and 1 Sikh. Number of houses, 565. Situated on the old left bank of the river Indus, at some distance from the present channel. Said to be the earliest settlement in the cis-Indus portion of the District. The town is surrounded by a circular road, along which, as well as along the main approaches to the town, are planted avenues of shisam trees. The b\u00e1z\u00e1r is well paved, the shops having masonry fronts. A fair is held here annually in August in honour of a local saint, Makhd\u00fam L\u00e1l Is\u00e1n, whose handsome shrine is then visited by about 25,000 people. Karor is a third-class municipality, with an income in 1883\u201384 of \u00a3245, or an average of 1s. 9d. per head of the population. Head-quarters of a civil court (muns\u00edfi), and of a police station (th\u00e1na).\n\nKaror.\u2014Town and municipality in M\u00falt\u00e1n District, Punjab.\u2014See KAHROR.\n\nKarra (Kara; Corah).\u2014Town in Sir\u00e1thu tahsil, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces; on the right bank of the Ganges, 42 miles by road north-west of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d city. Lat. 25\u00b0 41' N., long. 81\u00b0 24' E. Formerly the capital of a native fief. In 1286 A.D., Muiz-ud-d\u00edn and his father, Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn, held a meeting in the middle of the river, opposite Karra, and determined to unite their forces for an attack upon Delhi. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the town formed the head-quarters of the Musalm\u00e1n governors in the Lower Do\u00e1b. Firoz Sh\u00e1h was murdered here in 1295 by Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn. In 1338, Niz\u00e1m Ma-in attempted to revolt at Karra, but was at once arrested by Ain-ul-Mulk and flayed alive. During the rains of 1346, Karra was occupied by the rebel cobbler of Gujr\u00e1t, Takhi; but Muhammad Sh\u00e1h followed him up from Ahmed\u00e1b\u00e1d and totally defeated him. In 1376, the fiefs of Karra, Mahoba, and Dalamau were united under one governor, called the M\u00e1lik-ul-Shark. Akbar removed the seat of government to Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, which thenceforth superseded Karra in importance. (See ALLAHABAD DISTRICT.)\n\nAn old fort, now in ruins, together with a number of tombs, still attests the former magnificence of Karra. But Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1, Naw\u00e1b of Oudh, destroyed the finest edifices, for the materials, which he employed in building his own works at Lucknow. Population (1881) 5080, namely, Muhammadans, 3026, and Hindus, 2054. Area of town site, 133 acres. The local market has a traffic with Oudh and Fatehpur, principally in grain, cloth, and paper. The manufacture of paper has\nmuch declined of late years, owing principally to the establishment of the large paper factories at Serampur, near Calcutta. The place is still well known for its blankets. For conservancy and police purposes, a small house-tax is levied, which in 1881-82 realized \u00a3108. Post-office, police station, and station of the Great Trigonometrical Survey.\n\n**Karrak.**\u2014Salt-mine in Koh\u00e1t District, Punjab; one of the series which extends along the valley of the Teri Toi. Colonized in the time of Aurangzeb, but not quarried till about 1800. The salt occurs as a massive rock, almost pure, and is excavated over a tract 1 mile in length. The produce is exported to Waz\u00edrist\u00e1n and K\u00e1b\u00fal by the Povindah merchants. The salt quarried from these mines during the six years ending 1881-82 yielded an average annual income to Government in the shape of duty of \u00a31105. The duty realized in 1883-84 amounted to \u00a32099.\n\n**Karsi\u00e1ng (Kurseong).**\u2014Sub-division of D\u00e1rjiling District, Bengal.

It is also an important station on the D\u00e1rjiling-Him\u00e1layan Railway, 30 miles from its starting-point at Siliguri, and 20 miles from its terminus at D\u00e1rjiling. Distance from Calcutta by rail, 226 miles. It forms a central point for the tea-planters between D\u00e1rjiling and the plains, has a good hotel, and is within easy reach of some of the most romantic scenery in the wonderful ascent made by the hill railway. Population (1881) 4343; municipal income (1883-84), \u00a3592; average incidence of taxation, 2s. 4\u00bdd. per head of the population.\n\n**Kartairi.**\u2014River of Madras Presidency; rising near the station of Ut\u00e1kamand (Ootacamund) in the Nilgiri Hills District. After flowing through the rich coffee-growing tract of Kartairi, at an elevation of about 6000 feet, it descends upon the plains in a series of beautiful waterfalls and cascades at Kull\u00e1r, and finally falls into the Bhav\u00e1ni near Mettapolliem, in lat. 11\u00b0 18' N., and long. 76\u00b0 57' E.

Hereditary residence of the Sikh Guru or High Priest, and therefore a place of great sanctity. Founded in 1588 by Guru Arjun, whose father, Guru R\u00e1m D\u00e1s, obtained the site from the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. When Arjun came to the place and desired to build his hut, a demon who inhabited the trunk of a tree would not permit any wood to be cut until the Guru promised that he should not be disturbed, but should receive worship for ever at the shrine.

A coral island surrounded by a reef, which drops down into deep water. Along the shore the blown sand has accumulated and formed sandhills. The centre is a mangrove swamp, or in parts plain sand, cut up by creeks and overflowed at flood-tide. At the south-east corner, a little arable land is cultivated during the season by W\u00e1ghars (originally Hindu pirates) from the mainland. The reefs of coral are covered with anemones and living coral, where mud has not silted over them; the mud kills the coral, but affords nourishment to the mangroves which grow readily on the coral reefs. On the north-west corner of\nthe island is a lighthouse; a whitewashed tower 30 feet high, with an ordinary fixed white light, burning kerosine oil; visible in clear weather at a distance of 10 miles. The arc of illumination is S. 59\u00b0 W. to N. 18\u00b0 W. Lat. 22\u00b0 26' N., long. 69\u00b0 4' E.\n\n**K\u00e1run.**\u2014River of the Central Provinces; rising in the K\u00e1nker zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, in lat. 21\u00b0 10' N., and long. 81\u00b0 25' E.

Head-quarters of the Kar\u00far t\u00e1luk; with post-office, railway station, court, etc.\n\nKar\u00far was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Chera or Eastern Ker\u00e1la. During the struggles between the rival dynasties of Chera,\nChola, and Pandya, it changed hands more than once. With the rise of the N\u00e1yaks, Kar\u00far fell to the kingdom of Mad\u00fara; but it was frequently attacked and occupied by the Mysore armies, until towards the end of the 17th century it was finally annexed to the latter kingdom, and became its most important frontier post. In 1736, Ch\u00e1nda S\u00e1hib besieged it unsuccessfully.\n\nIn the year 1760, the town was captured by the English after a short siege, and held by them till 1768, when it was retaken by Haidar Ali, to whom its possession was confirmed by treaty in the following year. In 1783, Colonel Lang held the fort for a few months. It was a third time captured in 1790 by General Medows, and again restored in 1792. At the close of the second Mysore war, in 1799, which ended with the death of Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, Kar\u00far was finally ceded to the English, and was abandoned as a military station in 1801. The ruins of this oft-contested fort remain, and, with the old temple, are the principal points of interest in the town. The fort, however, is in some places nearly obliterated. The Jesuit fathers established a mission here as early as 1639.\n\nKar\u00far is now a busy market town, with an excellent road system converging on it. It is a station on the Erode branch of the South Indian Railway, and is an important centre of traffic. The municipality had in 1882\u201383 an income from taxation, excluding Imperial licence tax, of \u00a3861, the incidence of taxation being 1s. per head of the population.\n\nK\u00e1rvir.\u2014A local name of Kolhapur, q.v.

Hindus in 1881 numbered 272,101, or nearly 99 per cent. of the total population; Muhammadans, 3668; Christians, 54; and 'others,' 7.\n\nThe estate is bounded north by Chandragiri, east by K\u00e1lahasti and Chengalpat, south by W\u00e1l\u00e1j\u00e1-pet, and west by Chitt\u00far. The region is hilly, and is traversed by the north-west line of the Madras Railway. Timber is cut on the Nagari Hills, and sent by rail to Madras. Sixty per cent. of the land is uncultivable; one-half the remainder, or about 100,000 acres, is under the plough. Indigo is largely cultivated. The zamind\u00e1ri is described in Orme as Bommarauze's country, Bommarauze being a leading paleg\u00e1r in the period of the early Karn\u00e1tik wars. Permanent revenue or tribute (peshkash), \u00a318,049; estimated gross\nrental, about \u00a360,000. A very fertile tract, with a hardy and intelligent peasantry. Sub-magistrates are stationed at Putt\u00far and Tirut\u00e1ni, the head-quarters of divisions of the zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri. The chief manufacture is weaving. There are 117 miles of road in the estate.\n\nKarwaitnagar.\u2014Principal town in Karwaitnagar estate, North Arcot District, Madras Presidency. Situated seven miles west of Putt\u00far, and a station on the north-west line of the Madras Railway. Population (1871) 6894; (1881) 5874. Hindus numbered 5317; Muhammadans, 554; and Christians, 3. Karwaitnagar was formerly strongly fortified, and surrounded by a broad wall, eight feet high, having two gates, one on the south and one on the west. Only traces of these works now remain.\n\nK\u00e1rw\u00e1r.\u2014Sub-division of North K\u00e1nara District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 281 square miles; contains 1 town and 51 villages, with 8590 houses. Population (1872) 45,131; (1881) 47,742, or 23,738 males and 24,004 females. Hindus numbered 40,886; Muhammadans, 2909; Christians, 3896; Jews, 21; and \u2018others,\u2019 30.\n\nThe Sub-division lies in the north-west of the District, with a coastline of eighteen miles. The K\u00e1l\u00ednadi flows from east to west through the centre, and as it enters the sea throws up a bar of sand impassable to any but small craft. Along both banks of the river, broad belts of rice land, broken by groves of palms and other fruit trees, stretch east to near the Sahy\u00e1dri hills. The soil on the plains is sandy, and near the hills is much mixed with granite. On the banks of the K\u00e1l\u00ednadi, and along the sea-shore, are large tracts of gajni land, a black alluvial deposit charged with salt and liable to be flooded at high tides. To bring these gajni lands under tillage, a strong and costly wall must be built to keep out the sea. A heavy rainfall is required to sweeten the land, and then, without much manure and with due care, rich crops may be raised. Throughout the Sub-division the villages are not gathered into streets, but the houses are scattered along narrow lanes, standing in shady cocoa-palm gardens, some tiled and some thatched, each with its well, bathing-place, and cattle-shed. Here and there is a well-built temple, and a few villages have a Roman Catholic church.\n\nThe Sub-division contains three ports, namely SADASHIVGARH, Karwar, and Chendia, which are grouped for customs purposes into the K\u00e1rw\u00e1r division. The value of imports of merchandise and treasure (exclusive of Government stores and treasure) in 1882\u201383 from Indian ports, British or other, amounted to \u00a3219,493, and from foreign ports \u00a310,947, making a total of \u00a3230,440. The exports to Indian ports, British or other, stood at \u00a3356,117, and to foreign ports \u00a34635, the total being \u00a3360,752. The average annual value of the trade at the K\u00e1rw\u00e1r customs division, during the five years ending 1882\u201383, is returned as follows:\u2014Imports,\n\u00a3204,280, and exports, \u00a3535,143. The number of vessels, steam, sailing, and native craft, which entered with cargoes the three ports of the customs division in 1882-83 from Indian ports, British or other, was 949, tons 172,145, of which 118 were steamers, tons 157,621; and from foreign ports 5, all sailing, tons 385. The vessels which cleared with cargoes for Indian ports, British or other, numbered 995, tons 180,925, of which 117 were steamers, tons 156,097; and for foreign ports one, a steamer, tons 1514. The chief imports, most of which are for local use, are wheat, tobacco, and European cloth. The exports are chiefly cotton, native hand-made cloth, and husked and unhusked rice.\n\nK\u00e1rw\u00e1r (Carwar; K\u00e1dw\u00e1d).\u2014Chief town, port, and municipality of K\u00e1rw\u00e1r Sub-division, and the head-quarters of North K\u00e1nara District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 14\u00b0 50' N., long. 74\u00b0 14' E.; 50 miles south-east of Goa, and 295 miles south-east of Bombay. Population (1872) 13,263; (1881) 13,761, namely, males 7155, and females 6606. Hindus numbered 10,740; Muhammadans, 1099; Christians, 1848; Jains, 31; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 17; and 'others,' 26. The municipal income of the town in 1882-83 was \u00a3963, of which \u00a3760 were derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 1\u00bdd. per head of the population.\n\nHistory.\u2014Old K\u00e1rw\u00e1r, on the banks of the K\u00e1l\u00ednadi, 3 miles to the east of K\u00e1rw\u00e1r (the new town), was once an important place of commerce. During the first half of the 17th century, the K\u00e1rw\u00e1r revenue superintendent, or des\u00e1i, was one of the chief officers of the Bij\u00e1pur kingdom, of which it formed a part. In 1638, the fame of the pepper of Sonda induced Sir William Courten's Company to open a factory at K\u00e1rw\u00e1r. In 1660 the factory was prosperous, exporting the finest muslins in Western India; the weaving country was inland to the east, at Hubli and other centres, where as many as 50,000 weavers were employed. Besides the great export of muslin, K\u00e1rw\u00e1r provided pepper, cardamoms, cassia, and coarse blue cotton cloth (dungari). In 1665, Sivaji, the founder of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power, exacted a contribution of \u00a3112 from the English. In 1673, the faujd\u00e1r, or military governor, of K\u00e1rw\u00e1r laid siege to the factory. In 1764, Sivaji burnt K\u00e1rw\u00e1r town; but the English were treated civilly, and no harm was done to the factory. In 1676, the factory suffered from the exactions of local chiefs, and the establishment was withdrawn in 1679. It was restored in 1682 on a larger scale than before. In 1684, the English were nearly driven out of K\u00e1rw\u00e1r; the crew of one of two small vessels having stolen and killed a cow. In 1685, the Portuguese stirred the des\u00e1is of K\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Sonda to revolt. During the last ten years of the 17th century, the Dutch made every attempt to depress the English pepper trade; and in\n1697 the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s laid K\u00e1rw\u00e1r waste. In 1715, the old fort of K\u00e1rw\u00e1r was pulled down, and Sadashivgarh was built by the Sonda chief. The new fort seriously interfered with the safety of the English factory; and owing to the hostility of the Sonda chief, the factory was removed in 1720. The English, in spite of their efforts to regain the favour of the Sonda chiefs, were unable to obtain leave to re-open their factory at K\u00e1rw\u00e1r till 1750. The Portuguese in 1752 sent a fleet and took possession of Sad\u00e1shivgarh. As the Portuguese claimed the monopoly of the K\u00e1rw\u00e1r trade, and were in a position to enforce their claim, the English agent was withdrawn. In 1801, old K\u00e1rw\u00e1r was in ruins.\n\nThe new town dates from after the transfer of North K\u00e1nara District to the Bombay Presidency in 1862. Before the transfer, it was a mere fishing village. The present town and neighbouring offices and residences are in the lands of six villages, and within the municipal limits of the town are nine villages. A proposal was strenuously urged in Bombay to connect K\u00e1rw\u00e1r by a railway with the interior, so as to provide a seaport for the southern cotton districts. Between 1867\u201374, the hope that a railway from K\u00e1rw\u00e1r to Hubli would be sanctioned raised the value of building sites at K\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and led to the construction of many warehouses and dwellings. The scheme has been finally abandoned in favour of the Marmagoa-Hubli line. As soon as this line is opened, the importance of K\u00e1rw\u00e1r, as a seaport and market town, will greatly diminish, as all cotton, grain, and spices will be sent to Marmagoa. Already (1882) several old K\u00e1rw\u00e1r merchants have left for Goa, and many more are expected to follow.\n\nK\u00e1rw\u00e1r is the only safe harbour between Bombay and Cochin during all seasons of the year. In the bay is a cluster of islets called the Oyster Rocks, on the largest of which, Devgarh island, a lighthouse has been built, 210 feet above the sea, containing a white fixed dioptric light of the first order, on a white granite tower 72 feet high, visible 25 miles. There are two smaller islands in the bay (180 and 120 feet above the level of the sea), which afford good shelter to native craft and small vessels during the strong north-west winds that prevail from February to April. From the K\u00e1rw\u00e1r post-office on a white flagstaff, 60 feet from the ground and 65 feet above high-water, is displayed a red fixed ship\u2019s light, visible five miles; with the light bearing east-south-east, a vessel can anchor in three to five fathoms. About five miles south-west and two miles from the mainland, Anjidiva rises steep from the sea, dotted with trees and the houses of its small Portuguese settlement. Coasting steamers belonging to the British India Steam Navigation Company call weekly at K\u00e1rw\u00e1r throughout the year. These steamers generally make the trip between K\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Bombay in 48 hours. The average annual value of the trade at\nK\u00e1rw\u00e1r port, not of the K\u00e1rw\u00e1r customs division, during the five years ending 1880-81, is returned as follows:\u2014Imports, \u00a3232,306, and exports, \u00a3278,973. The imports for 1880-81 amounted to \u00a3187,882; and the exports to \u00a3270,116. Courts, post and telegraph offices, civil hospital, etc.\n\nKarwi (Kirwee).\u2014Sub-division of B\u00e1n\u1e0da District, North-Western Provinces; situated between 24\u00b0 53' and 25\u00b0 19' N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 50' and 81\u00b0 18' E. long. Comprises the three tahsils of Karwi, Kam\u00e1sin, and Mau (Mhow), also known as the Tiroh\u00e1n, Darsenda, and Chibu tahsils. This tract contains an area of 1292 square miles, and consists of two distinct portions, the mountains of the south, and the level plain extending from the foot of the hills northward to the Jumna. The latter region is well wooded and widely cultivated. Formerly a separate munsifi existed at Karwi, but the jurisdiction has recently been added to that of the subordinate Judge's Court at B\u00e1n\u1e0da. The Joint Magistrate for the Sub-division has his station at the town of Karwi, where an assistant superintendent of police is also stationed.\n\nKarwi (more properly Tiroh\u00e1n).\u2014South-eastern tahsil of B\u00e1n\u1e0da District, North-Western Provinces; consisting chiefly of rugged sandstone hills, the outliers of the Vindhyan system, and traversed by the Jabalpur (Jubbulpore) branch of the East Indian Railway, which has two stations within its boundaries, at M\u00e1\u0144ikpur and Markundi. Area, 572.8 square miles, of which 147.3 square miles are cultivated. Population stationary, being returned at 85,323 in 1872, and 85,318 in 1881. Classified according to religion, the population in the latter year consisted of\u2014Hindus, 82,205; Muhammadans, 3086; Jains, 14; and 'others,' 13. Number of villages, 189, of which 137 contained less than 500 inhabitants. Land revenue, \u00a39456; total Government revenue, \u00a310,591; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a315,885. In 1884, the Sub-division contained 2 criminal courts, with 4 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 74 men; and village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 263.\n\nKarwi.\u2014Town in B\u00e1n\u1e0da District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of the Sub-division and tahsil. Lat. 25\u00b0 12' 10\" N., long. 80\u00b0 56' 50\" E.; situated on the river P\u00e1isuni; distant from B\u00e1n\u1e0da 44 miles south-east, from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d about 60 miles west. Population (1881) 4167, chiefly Hindus. For police and conservancy purposes, Karwi and the neighbouring village of Tiroh\u00e1n (population 2751) form one municipality under Act xx. of 1856. In 1805, Karwi had a cantonment for British troops; and in 1829, it became the principal residence of the Peshw\u00e1's representative, who lived in almost regal state, and built several beautiful temples and wells. Numerous traders from the Deccan were thus attracted to Karwi. During the Mutiny, N\u00e1r\u00e1yan R\u00e1o, after the murder at B\u00e1n\u1e0da of Mr. Cockerell, Joint Magistrate of Karwi, assumed the government, and retained his inde-\npendence for eight months amid the subsequent anarchy. The accumulations of his family constituted the great treasure afterwards so famous as 'the Kirwee and Banda Prize Money.' It was kept in a vault of the Bara, a large building, forming the palace of Narayan Rao's family. The greater part of their possessions were afterwards confiscated for rebellion, and the Bara now serves as a tahsil, police station, and school-house. Balwant Rao, the present head of the family, still retains a considerable estate, though small by comparison with that of his predecessors. Since the Mutiny, the prosperity of Karwi has gradually declined. Station of a Joint Magistrate and an assistant District superintendent of police. The jurisdiction of the munsif has been removed to Banda. Magnificent temple and tank, with masonry well attached, known as the Ganesh Bagh, and built by Benaiik Rao in 1837. Five mosques, and as many Hindu temples. Government dispensary, post-office. Trade unimportant.\n\nKasai (Cossye).\u2014River of Bengal; rises in the north-west of Manbhumi District, in lat. 23\u00b0 28' 30\" N., and long. 85\u00b0 58' 15\" E. It follows a very winding south-easterly and easterly course, through Manbhumi, Bankura, and Midnapur, till it falls into the Haldi in the latter District, about 20 miles above the confluence of that river with the Hugli. During the rainy season, the Kasai is navigable by boats of 2 tons burden from its mouth to some distance above the town of Midnapur, which is situated on its north or left bank; but in the dry weather it is nowhere navigable by large boats, except for a few miles above its confluence with the Haldi. A considerable floating trade in timber, chiefly sal, is carried on during the rainy season, from the south of Manbhumi into Midnapur. Its only tributary is the united stream of the Kumari and Tetka, which under the former name joins the Kasai at Ambikanagar in Bankura District.\n\nKasalang.\u2014Tributary of the Karnaphuli river, rising in the extreme north of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bengal. It flows southwards, receiving two small tributaries in its course, one on either bank, and falls into the Karnaphuli at Kasalang village, in lat. 22\u00b0 44' N., long. 92\u00b0 19' E. Navigable by small boats for about eight days' journey from its mouth.\n\nKasalang.\u2014Village in the District of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bengal; situated at the confluence of the Kasalang river with the Karnaphuli. Lat. 22\u00b0 44' N., long. 92\u00b0 19' 30\" E. One of the principal marts for the sale of hill produce. Kasalang was formerly the frontier station in the direction of the Lushai Hills, and an annual fair was held here which was attended by the local officers, for the purpose of keeping up friendly intercourse between the independent chiefs and the people within the District. A darbar or reception was yearly held on this occasion by the District officer, at which gifts were distributed to the\nKuk\u00eds and other visitors. After the Lush\u00e1i campaign of 1871-72, the frontier line was extended considerably farther east, and the frontier head-quarters station was removed from K\u00e1s\u00e1lang to Dem\u00e1g\u00edr\u00ed, a post on the Karnaph\u00fali river about 30 miles above the Bark\u00fal rapids. Since that date the annual fair and darb\u00e1r has been held at Dem\u00e1g\u00edr\u00ed, instead of at K\u00e1s\u00e1lang.\n\n**K\u00e1saraghat.**\u2014Pass over the range of the Western Gh\u00e1ts, boundary of Th\u00e1na and N\u00e1sik Districts, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Th\u00e1lgh\u00e1t.\n\n**K\u00e1saragod (Cassergode).**\u2014T\u00e1luk or Sub-division in South K\u00e1nara District, Madras Presidency.

K\u00e1saragod formed the southernmost post of the ancient Tuluva kingdom, and still contains a ruined fort of the Ikheri kings. In 1883-84, the imports were valued at \u00a38427, and the exports at \u00a37077.\n\n**Kasauli (Kussowlee).**\u2014Cantonment and convalescent depot in Simla District, Punjab; situated on the crest of a hill, overlooking the K\u00e1lka valley; distant from Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umballa) 45 miles north, from Simla station 32 miles south-west. Lat. 30\u00b0 53' 13\" N., long. 77\u00b0 0' 52\" E. The cantonment was formed in 1844-45, on land acquired from the Native State of B\u00edja, and barracks were erected in the same year. Since that date, detachments of European troops have continuously occupied the station, and many private visitors also arrive during the summer months. The Kasauli Hill, a summit of the Sub\u00e1thu group, has an\nelevation of 6322 feet above sea-level, and commands magnificent views over the plains to the south-west, and towards the snowy range of the Him\u00e1layas on the north. Although healthy under ordinary circumstances, the proximity to the plains renders Kasauli liable to epidemics. Outbreaks of cholera occurred in 1845, 1857, 1867, 1872, and 1875. Defective water-supply. Permanent station of an Assistant Commissioner; head-quarters of the Commissioner of Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 during the summer months.

Lat. 25\u00b0 51' N., long. 87\u00b0 34' 41\" E. The population, which in 1872 numbered 6288, had fallen by 1881 to 5124. Classified according to religion, the population in the latter year consisted of\u2014Hindus, 5040, and Muhammadans, 84. Area of town site, 392 acres. Kasb\u00e1 forms the largest centre of the rice trade in Purniah District. It is chiefly inhabited by Sunris, who collect unhusked rice from the northern tracts of Purniah and the submontane morang in D\u00e1rjiling, for export to Calcutta. Large vernacular school, with 150 pupils. Police outpost station.\n\n**K\u00e1sganj.**\u2014Northern tahsil of Etah District, North-Western Provinces, lying between the Ganges and the K\u00e1li N\u00e1di, and traversed by two main branches of the Lower Ganges Canal. Area, 500 square miles, of which 372 square miles are cultivated. The population, which in 1872 numbered 241,335, had by 1881 fallen to 216,906, showing a decrease of 24,429, or 10\u00b71 per cent., in the nine years. Classified according to religion, the population in 1881 consisted of\u2014Hindus, 191,372; Muhammadans, 25,190; Jains, 277; and \u2018others,\u2019 67.

Well-built, prosperous town, with handsome shops, and drained and metalled streets, with a good proportion of brick houses, shaded by fine trees. A metalled road runs through the centre of the town from north to south, and forms the principal b\u00e1z\u00e1r, while a second intersects it from east to west. The eastern quarter, inhabited by the poorer Hindus, is less well kept. A fine mosque, remarkable for its curious roof and numerous minarets, adorns the Muhammadan quarter. The town owes its origin to Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, the founder of Aliganj, under the Oudh Waz\u00edrs. His successors sold it to Col. James Gardner, from whom it passed into the hands of his agent, the late R\u00e1j\u00e1 D\u00edlsukh R\u00e1\u00ed. The public buildings include a municipal hall, dispensary, police station, tahs\u00edl, post-office, good school, and muns\u00edf. Brisk and increasing trade in cotton, sugar, gh\u00ed, indigo seed, and country produce. Increasing population; large business in grain and sugar.\n\nKashm\u00edr and Jamu (Cashmere and Jummoo).\u2014Native State, politically subordinate to the Government of India, constituting the territories of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Kashm\u00edr; extending from 32\u00b0 17' to 36\u00b0 58' N. lat., and from 73\u00b0 26' to 80\u00b0 30' E. long. Area, 80,900 square miles, with a population returned in 1873 at 1,534,972 persons. No later Census has up to the present date (1885) been carried out in Kashm\u00edr. The State is bounded on the north by some petty semi-independent hill chiefships, mostly subordinate to Kashm\u00edr, and by the Karakoram mountains; on the east by Chinese Tibet; on the south and west by the Punjab Districts and the Haz\u00e1ra country. The State comprises, in addition to the Districts of Kashm\u00edr Proper, Jamu, and P\u00fanch:\u2014the Governorships of Lad\u00e1kh and Gilghit, including the Districts of D\u00e1rd\u00edst\u00e1n, Balt\u00edst\u00e1n, Leh, Til\u00e1il, Suru, Zanskar, R\u00fapshu, and others. The Provinces of Kashm\u00edr and Jamu form the more important part of the State in a general view, and are here chiefly dwelt upon.\n\nHistory.\u2014The history of Kashmir is a task beyond the limits of this work. Valuable light has been thrown on its early periods by the records of the Chinese pilgrims in the Si-yu-ki. Like other outlying Provinces of India, its annals divide themselves into four eras:\u2014(1) Pre-Buddhistic; (2) Buddhistic; (3) Hindu; and (4) Muhammadan. First comes an age of pre-historic monsters, probably representing the non-\nAryan races, N\u00e1g\u00e1s, and others. Tradition relates that the Kashmir valley was at first altogether a lake, inhabited by a monster, Yaldeo, who was driven out by a Rishi. The holy man gave his name to the country left by the subsidence of the waters upon the removal of Yaldeo. According to this account, the first inhabitants were Indo-Aryans, and the object of their worship, the Sun-God. Buddhism found in Kashmir an asylum, from which its influence radiated north, south, east, and west. Tartar devastations and invasions occupy a long period of its history. Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed entered the valley in the eleventh century; the D\u00e1rd\u00edst\u00e1n chiefs and Tibetan kings made incursions, and forcibly married its Hindu princesses; T\u00farkist\u00e1n sent down its hordes. The old Hindu r\u00e1j found its final catastrophe in the death of the Queen of the last sovereign, who upbraided the Muhammadan usurper, and stabbed herself.\n\nMuhammadanism was introduced into Kashmir in the 14th century A.D., during the reign of Shams-ud-d\u00edn. In 1586, the country was conquered by Akbar, and became an integral part of the Mughal Empire. In 1752 it was subjugated by the Afgh\u00e1n, Ahmad Sh\u00e1h, the founder of the Dur\u00e1n\u00ed dynasty; and it remained under Afgh\u00e1n sway until 1819, when it was conquered by the Sikhs. From that time it was ruled by a governor appointed by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of the Punjab, until the Sikh war in 1845. Ghul\u00e1b Singh, who had begun life as a horseman under the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranjit Singh, but by distinguished conduct had raised himself to independent command, was presented with the principality of Jamu, whence, nominally on behalf of the Lahore State, he soon extended his authority over his R\u00e1jput neighbours, and eventually into Lad\u00e1kh and Balt\u00edst\u00e1n. In the revolution which preceded the outbreak of the Sikh war, he was elected Minister of the Kh\u00e1ls\u00e1, and he took an important part in the negotiations which followed the battle of Sobr\u00e1on. The results were, that he was enabled to secure his power by a separate treaty with the English at Amritsar (Umritsar) in March 1846, by which, on payment of 75 l\u00e1khs of rupees, or \u00a3750,000, he was confirmed in possession of the territory which he had held as feudatory of the Sikhs, and also obtained the Province of Kashmir.\n\nBy this treaty he bound himself to acknowledge the supremacy of the British Government, to refer all disputes with neighbouring States to its arbitration, to assist British troops when required, and never to take or retain in his service any British subject or the subject of any European or American State, except with the consent of the British Government. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 sent a contingent of troops and artillery to co-operate with the British forces against Delhi during the Mutiny of 1857. Ghul\u00e1b Singh died in August 1857, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranbh\u00edr Singh, G.C.S.I., who is by caste a Dogra R\u00e1jput, and was born about 1832. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kashmir is\nentitled to a personal salute of 21 guns, and has received a sanad giving adoptive rights. As a token of the supremacy of the British Government, he pays an annual tribute of 1 horse, 25 lbs. of pashm and fine wool, and 3 pairs of shawls. The military force of the State consists of about 19,000 men, including 5000 irregular troops, with 16 batteries of artillery, two of which are horsed; the cavalry, which is used principally for escort duties, consists of 2 regiments, mostly stationed near Jamu. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja was recently presented by the British Government with a mountain battery; and on the occasion of the Delhi Darb\u00e1r in January 1877, he was gazetted a general in the British Army, and created a Counsellor of the Empress. Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranbhir Singh died 12th September 1885, and was succeeded by his son, Pert\u00e1b Singh, at whose court a British Resident will be stationed.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The general aspect of the valley of Kashm\u00edr is that of a basin, encircled on every side by lofty mountains. In the middle is an extensive alluvial tract intersected by the Jehlam (Jhelum) and its numerous tributaries, which flow down from the mountains and find their way by the sole channel of the Jehlam through the B\u00e1ram\u00fala Pass to the plains of the Punjab. The elevation of this valley is about 5200 feet above the sea.\n\nBesides the low alluvial tract extending along the banks of the Jehlam, there occur extensive plateaux of slight elevation, stretching from the mountains at various distances into the plains. These plateaux are known as karewas or wudars. Their soil for the most part is a loam or loamy clay, containing remains of fresh-water fishes and molluscs, which indicate a lacustrine or fluvial origin. They are divided from each other by ravines of from 100 to 300 feet in depth. Occasionally they are entirely surrounded by lower ground, but more generally they connect with some of the mountains that bound the valley. Over the surface of the karewas, water has sometimes been brought for irrigation, and then a fertile tract is the result; but more commonly the cultivation depends on rain alone, and in that case the yield is precarious. The slopes of the hills between the flat ground and the limit of forest are a mixture of cultivation, good grazing grounds, and forests of cedars, pines, firs, etc. The lowest of the beds forming the karewas have been considered to be of the same geological age as the topmost Siw\u00e1liks, while the higher beds are of more modern origin. The portion of the valley unoccupied by the karewas is covered with a more modern alluvium, often containing objects of human workmanship. The southern and more inhabited portion of Kashm\u00edr includes the lower half of the Kishen Gang\u00e1 valley and the whole District south of the snowy range that separates the drainage of the Indus from that of the Jehlam and Chen\u00e1b. In this region the hills are covered with pine forests interspersed with pastures;\nthe banks of the streams are green with cultivation; villages are connected with each other by roads; while the principal valley is crowded with objects of interest, and is fertile and beautiful in a high degree.\n\nMountains.\u2014The lofty mountains which surround Kashmir include in some places large glaciers between their spurs, and are covered with snow for nearly eight months in the year. The glacier of Biafo on the north-west border is 35 miles long. The highest ascertained peaks in the Pans\u00e1l range are M\u00fali, 14,952 feet, and Ahertatopa, 13,042 feet; and in the north of Kashmir, Haram\u00fak, 16,015 feet. Captain Montgomerie, R.E., in his account of the Survey, states: \u2018On the P\u00edr Panj\u00e1l peaks, the electricity was so troublesome, even when there was no storm, that it was found necessary to carry a portable lightning conductor for the protection of the theodolite.\u2019 Beyond the limits of Kashmir, the isolated peak of Nanga Parbat, or Dayarmur\u2014in lat. 35\u00b0 14' 21\" N. and long. 74\u00b0 37' 52\" E., 26,629 feet above the sea\u2014forms a noble object. Its other name is Daiarmur; and it stands midway between the Kashmir valley and the river Indus. Other remarkable peaks close by are the Ser and Mer, the former 23,410 feet high, and the latter 23,250 feet. The range enclosing the Kashmir valley bears different names in different parts\u2014the snowy Pans\u00e1l on the east, the Fateh Pans\u00e1l and Pans\u00e1l of Banih\u00e1l on the south, the P\u00edr Panj\u00e1l on the west, the Drawar mountains on the north, and Haram\u00fak and Sonamarg mountains on the north-east. The soft and beautiful scenery of the valley is on the southern side, where the mountains slope gently. On the north the country is wild and sublime, the mountains rising in rugged precipices of stupendous height, down the bare sides of which the numerous streams leap in prolonged cataracts. Here are found some of the largest glaciers and highest peaks on the surface of the globe; long flat valleys, the lowest as high as the Faulhorn in Switzerland; and many habitable spots at an elevation as great nearly as that of Mont Blanc. The average height of this northern mountain barrier is from twenty to twenty-six thousand feet. One peak stands 28,250 feet out of the Karakoram range.\n\nThe beauties of the Kashmir valley have been so often celebrated in prose and verse, that further allusion to them here would be out of place. Moore, Vigne, Jacquemont, and flocks of annual visitors to Srinagar have rendered its scenery as well known as the most picturesque spots of Switzerland or Scotland. The P\u00edr Panj\u00e1l range is said to have been the home of a P\u00edr or Saint, who gave benediction to travellers passing northwards over the mountains. The belief is still current among Muhammadans in Kashmir that the P\u00edr resides on one of the summits, and the whole range is thus invested with peculiar sanctity. The general direction of the range is from north-west to south-east. The\nhighest part is of basaltic formation, consisting of upheaved amygdaloidal trap, transition rocks appearing on its borders. Quartz, slate, and other primary formations are observable on the northern side. The lowest parts of the table-lands of Rukshu are 15,000 feet above the level of the sea. The snow-line here recedes as high as 20,000 feet, attributed to the great radiation of heat from the high table-lands about. The plains of Deos\u00e1i, which embrace a portion of Baltist\u00e1n, are of immense extent, bordering the river Indus, and are shut in by snowy ranges penetrated by valleys of great depth.\n\nThe principal passes from the mountains into the Kashmir valley are the following:\n\n| Situation | Name          | Elevation in Feet | From what Place                  |\n|-----------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|\n| North     | R\u00e1jdiangau    | 11,800            | Gurais, Skardo.                  |\n| South     | Marbal       | 11,570            | Kistaw\u00e1r, Chamba.                |\n|           | Banih\u00e1l      | 9,200             | Jamu, Si\u00e1lkot.                   |\n|           | P\u00edr Panj\u00e1l   | 11,400            | Bhimbar, R\u00e1j\u00e1ori, Gujr\u00e1t.        |\n| East      | Margan       | 11,600            | Maru, Wardw\u00e1n, S\u00faru.             |\n|           | Zoji-la      | 11,300            | Dras, Lad\u00e1kh.                    |\n| West      | Tosh\u00e1 Maidan | ?                 | P\u00fanch, Jehlam.                   |\n|           | Firozpur     | 12,560            | Murree, Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d, P\u00fanch.       |\n|           | B\u00e1ram\u00fala    | ...               | Karnas, Muzaffar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d.|\n|           | Nattishannar | 10,200?           |                                  |\n\nThe margs or mountain downs, which are numerous on the tops of the range of hills immediately below the P\u00edr Panj\u00e1l, and also upon the northern slopes of those mountains which enclose the north-eastern side of the valley, are a peculiar feature of the country. They are covered with rich grass, and afford pasturage during the summer months to large herds of ponies, cattle, sheep, and goats. Sonamarg (or golden meadow) is a favourite refuge in the malarious months of July and August, both for Europeans and natives of high rank.\n\nRivers.\u2014The principal river of Kashmir is the Jehlam (Jhelum), which nearly intersects the valley. Formed by the junction of three streams\u2014the Arpat, the Bring, and the Sandaram\u2014which rise at the south-east end of the valley, it receives in its course numerous tributaries. Among those which join it on the right bank are the Liddar from the north-east, near Isl\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1d; the Sind from the east, opposite Sh\u00e1d\u00edpur; and the Pohr\u00fa, which flows into it near Sop\u00far. On its left bank it is joined by the combined waters of the Veshan and Rembi\u00e1ra near Murh\u00e1ma; by the Ramch\u00faat Kark\u00e1rpur and the Dudh Gang\u00e1 at Sr\u00ednagar.\n\nThe Kishen Gang\u00e1, or river of Krishna, which has its sources on the edges of the Deos\u00e1i plain and in the Til\u00e1il valley, is also a con-\nsiderable stream. It flows in a north-north-westerly direction till near Shardi, when it turns to the south-west and joins the Jehlam just below the town of Muzaffar\u00e1b\u00e1d. The Maru Wardw\u00e1n river, which drains the Wardw\u00e1n valley, flows southward, joining the Chen\u00e1b above Kistaw\u00e1r. The latter river traverses Kistaw\u00e1r and Badraw\u00e1r, flowing into the plains some miles to the west of Jamu. Of these rivers, the Jehlam alone is navigable, from the neighbourhood of Isl\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1d to B\u00e1ram\u00fala, a distance of about 60 miles.\n\nThe Jehlam is spanned by 13 bridges in its course through the valley of Kashmir. These bridges, which are of peculiar construction, are called kadals. They are all made of deodar wood, and are constructed in the following manner:\u2014A space either triangular with the apex up stream, or more commonly hexagonal, having a triangular apex at each end, facing up as well as down stream, is formed in the bed of the river by strong stakes, which are well driven down and covered with planks on the outside to a height of about 8 feet. This space is then filled with heavy stones, to form the foundation of a pier. Each pier consists of alternate layers of deodar trunks, which are placed about a foot apart, every succeeding layer being broader than the previous one, and laid at right angles to it. The trunks are fastened together at their ends by strong wooden pegs. The piers are united by long and very stout deodar trunks, which stretch across from one to the other, and are laid about 2 feet apart. The platform consists of rough planks or slender poles, which are closely laid across the trunks that connect the piers, and are fastened at each end by wooden pegs. In some cases there is a coating of grass and earth over the platform, and a railing on each side.\n\nSmaller bridges of a single span are usually constructed in the following manner:\u2014On either side of the stream, abutments of rubble masonry, laced with cross-beams of timber, are built up, and into these are inserted stout beams, one over the other in successively projecting tiers, the interstices between the latter being filled up with cross-beams. The projecting poles increase in size as they approach the upper platform, and have a slight incline upwards, their shore ends being firmly braced into the stone-work. Between the uppermost row of timbers, two or three long and very strong connecting trees are placed, and scantlings laid over them for the pathway; sometimes a railing is added for greater security. Such bridges are frequently of considerable span, and, if well built, last from thirty to forty years.\n\nNext in importance come the rope suspension bridges, which are often of great length; of these there are two descriptions, called respectively chika and jhola. The chika bridge consists simply of six or eight stout ropes close together, stretched between rude piers\non either bank of the torrent. On them a ring of timber, formed of a section of a tree about 2 feet long and 1 foot in diameter, slides, being hauled backwards and forwards by a rope attached to it, and connected with the suspension ropes at intervals of about 20 feet by stout cane rings. To the slide a loop of ropes is secured, through which the legs of the traveller are inserted, and he clasps his hands in front of him round the ropes to preserve a sitting position. It looks dangerous, but is in practice a perfectly safe, though tedious, operation. Baggage is carried across in the same manner, each package being lashed to the loop and hauled across separately; and in like manner sheep and goats, and sometimes cows, are conveyed across rivers and torrents.\n\nA jhola bridge is formed of a stout rope of five or six distinct strands, stretched between piers and securely fastened on either side of the river. This forms the footway; and about 3 feet above it on either side is a guy-rope, which is grasped by the passenger to enable him to retain his footing on the bridge. The guy-ropes are kept in their places by being attached at intervals to the ends of forked branches like the merry-thought of a chicken. Some of these bridges swing a good deal with the weight of the traveller, and are trying to the nerves of those unaccustomed to them. The ropes of which they are constructed are made either of hemp, or willow, or birch twigs, and are renewed annually, or as often as occasion may require.\n\nThe Sr\u00ednagar tract is intersected with a labyrinth of canals. To avoid the necessity of crossing the dangerous W\u00falar Lake, through which flows the main stream of the Jehlam, a navigable canal was constructed in early times to connect Sop\u00far with Sr\u00ednagar. Irrigation canals are very numerous; of these the Sh\u00e1hk\u00fal Canal in Khaurp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, and the Naindi and Ninnar Canals near Isl\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1d, are the most important.\n\nThe lakes of Kashmir are numerous, both in the valley itself, and upon the mountains surrounding it. In the valley the principal lakes are:\u2014The Dal or \u2018city lake,\u2019 five miles long, which is situated north-east of Sr\u00ednagar, and is connected with the Jehlam by a canal called the Tsont-i-k\u00fal, or \u2018apple-tree canal,\u2019 which enters it opposite the palace. The Anchar is situated to the north of Sr\u00ednagar; it is connected with the Dal by means of the N\u00e1lamar, which flows into the Sind river near Sh\u00e1d\u00edpur. The M\u00e1nasbal, said to be the most beautiful lake in Kashmir, is situated near the right bank of the Jehlam, and is 1\u00bd miles long, \u00be of a mile wide, and very deep. The W\u00falar is the largest of all the Kashmir lakes. Its extreme breadth from north to south is 1\u00bd miles, exclusive of the marshes on the south side; extreme length, 10 miles; circumference, nearly 30 miles; average depth, 12 feet; deepest part, about 16 feet. The Jehlam flows into the W\u00falar on its east side near the middle of the lake, leaving it at its south-west corner in a fine\nopen stream about 200 yards wide. Like every other lake surrounded by mountains, the W\u00falar is liable to the action of sudden and furious hurricanes that sweep over its surface. The chief mountain lakes are\u2014the Konsa N\u00e1g, situated on the top of the P\u00edr Panj\u00e1l range; the Sh\u00edsha N\u00e1g, situated above the head of the Liddar valley; the Gang\u00e1b\u00e1l N\u00e1g and Sarbal N\u00e1g, situated on the top of Haram\u00fak, which overlooks the north-eastern shore of the W\u00falar.\n\nMinerals.\u2014Iron abounds, but Vigne states that the ore of Kashm\u00edr is not considered good; and Moorcroft remarks that, though iron is found in considerable quantities, the metal used in the fabrication of gun-barrels requires to be imported from the Punjab. Near the village of Harpatnar, at the northern extremity of the Kutih\u00e1r District, a copper mine is said to have been worked within late years. Plumbago abounds in the P\u00edr Panj\u00e1l mountains, and it has lately been found of inferior quality on the east side of the Maru Wardw\u00e1n valley. Sulphur springs are common, but the mineral has nowhere been found in a solid state. Sulphide of lead (surma) is found in the Jamu hills, and samples of coal from the same locality have been exhibited in the Lahore Exhibition. The rocks in the immediate vicinity of Daudela are thin carbonaceous shales and grits with earthy ferruginous limestones; among them is a seam of coal or anthracite, varying in thickness from 1 inch to nearly 2 feet, undulating in chambers or bunches more than in a continuous seam. The general character of the coal is that of a hard anthracite. During the progress of the Kashm\u00edr Survey, Captain Montgomerie, R.E., found gold dust in the bed of the Shigar or Shingo river, a tributary of the Dras, but the quantity to be obtained was very small. Gold-washing is also carried on to a very trifling extent on the banks of the Jehlam, in the neighbourhood of Tangrot.\n\nSulphurous springs burst forth in many parts of the valley of Kashm\u00edr, and earthquakes are of not uncommon occurrence. In June 1828, the city of Srinagar was shaken by an earthquake which destroyed about 1200 houses and 1000 persons. For more than two months afterwards, lesser shocks were daily experienced. Abu Fazl, in describing the country about two centuries previously, mentions the frequent occurrence of earthquakes at that period. Some years ago at Sogam, near the north-western extremity of the valley, the ground became so hot that sand is said to have been fused.\n\nThe most terrible visitation on record of earthquake in Kashmir occurred in June and July of the present year (1885). An enormous quantity of private and Government property was destroyed, and many thousand lives were lost. Throughout large tracts almost the whole population was rendered homeless, and for a time depended upon State relief for subsistence.\nWild Animals.\u2014Bears are found in all parts of Kashmir State, and, although far less numerous than formerly, are still very common. Though formidable animals, they do not usually molest man unless previously attacked. Of the brown or red species, which is between six and seven feet long, there are two varieties, viz. the Ursus isabellinus, inhabiting the lower ranges, and the Ursus arctus, found higher up the mountains. The black bear (Ursus tibetanus), though smaller than the brown, is far more dangerous, and is usually found lower down. Both species are chiefly herbivorous, but also partly carnivorous. Leopards are found all round the Kashmir valley, but they infest the grazing grounds, where they sometimes commit great havoc amongst the cattle. The ounce, or snow leopard, has been seen in Til\u00e1il. The bar\u00e1singha, or large stag, is found throughout the Pans\u00e1l range generally, except where it slopes towards the plains. It is not, however, usually met with until the middle of September, though occasionally seen in the middle of August with fully developed horns. Both Hindus and Muhammadans eat the flesh of the stag. The gural, or Him\u00e1layan chamois, is found on the Pans\u00e1l range, and in Kistaw\u00e1r. The ibex is found in the northern parts of Kashmir. It is stated to be larger than the European ibex; the horns, too, are longer, more curved, and more tapering. The kh\u00e1k\u00e1r, or barking deer, is usually found only upon the southern and western slopes of the Pans\u00e1l range. The m\u00e1rkhor, or serpent-eater, is a species of gigantic goat; it is migratory, and is found all over the P\u00edr Panj\u00e1l beyond the B\u00e1ram\u00fala Pass, and upon the mountains between the Jehlam and Kishen Gang\u00e1 rivers. The musk deer is found in birch woods in all parts of Kashmir at a certain elevation. The sarrau or buz-i-kohi (mountain goat) and the thar (another species of mountain goat) are found upon the Pans\u00e1l range.\n\nWolves are numerous on the mountains of Kashmir, and often do great injury to the flocks of sheep. They are not often seen in the valley. Monkeys are common in the lower portion of the Kishen Gang\u00e1 valley. Foxes and jackals are numerous; the former is not the little grey species of Hindust\u00e1n, but large and full brushed, like an English fox. A species of marmot, called dr\u00fam or pua, is found amid the rocks at high elevation; it is as large as a fox, of a dull yellowish colour, with tawny belly, the head, back, and tail being marked with a darker stripe, distinguishable at a considerable distance. It is stated that this animal is frequently a prey to the eagle; it emits a shrill cry on the approach of danger. The otter is frequently met with in the rivers, and its skin is highly prized. The porcupine is found in Kistaw\u00e1r. There are few reptiles in Kashmir; venomous serpents are rare, though the cobra has been seen.\nBirds of prey are numerous, and there are several varieties of eagles and vultures, and also of falcons and hawks. Many kinds of game birds are found. The black chikor, grey and snow species of partridge, are met with in many parts. Of pheasants, the varieties found are the argus, min\u00e1l, kallij, koklas, and the snow. The common kind of quail, the jack-snipe, and the woodcock are met with. Waterfowl of every species abound during the winter months. They come from Y\u00e1rkand and Central Asia, in order to avoid the cold of the more northern regions, and depart as soon as spring commences. Bald-coots, moorhens, dab-chicks, and grebes are constantly to be found in the autumn and winter. Herons are common. The s\u00e1ras, or gigantic crane, is often seen in the marshes, and also a small kind of pelican. The bulbul, or nightingale of Kashm\u00edr, is a distinct species, greatly inferior in note to the genuine nightingale of Europe. The cuckoo, the m\u00e1ina, and the hoopoe are common. The parrot is not indigenous to the valley, but the golden oriole is frequently met with. Flies, sandflies, and mosquitoes are numerous and troublesome, especially in August and September.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of the dominions of the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kashm\u00edr and Jamu was estimated in 1875 at about 1,600,000 persons. This estimate is doubtless founded on the Census made in 1873, the details of which are given in Appendix vii. of Drew's Kashm\u00edr. No Census of Kashm\u00edr State was carried out in 1881. The total population in 1873 was given at 1,534,972, excluding ladies of rank (parda nash\u00edn), who live in close retirement. The total population of the Jamu District is put at 861,075; of Kashm\u00edr Proper, at 491,846; of Lad\u00e1kh, Iskardoh, and Gilghit, at 104,485; of P\u00fanch, at 77,566. Of the total, the number of Hindus was 506,699; of Muhammadans, 918,536; of sundry castes, 89,483; and of Buddhists, 20,254. The great majority of the Muhammadans belong to the Sunni sect. The respectable Hindu castes are the Br\u00e1hmans and the K\u00e1rk\u00fans; the latter form the most numerous class, and are employed as writers, merchants, and farmers, but never as soldiers.\n\nAn estrangement exists between Kashmiri Pandits who have been domiciled in British India, and their brethren in Kashmir. It is not long since that a service similar to that for the dead was performed over such Kashmiri Pandits as were about to emigrate, as their relatives looked upon them as dead thenceforward. The way was so long and difficult, and the means of correspondence so uncertain, that they never expected to receive tidings of the absentees, much less to welcome them back into the home circle. In time, the wanderers fell away from the customs of their house, and embraced those of the people amongst whom they had settled. Thus it has come to pass, that whilst Kashmiri Pandits domiciled in India have accepted\nthe severe ritual of the Indian Br\u00e1hmans in matters of food and drink; their brethren in Kashmir, whom they characterize as intolerant and ignorant, do not object to meat, will take water from a Muhammadan, eat with their clothes on, and have no repugnance to cooking and taking their meals on board a boat.\n\nThe inhabitants of Kashmir are physically a fine race. The men are tall, strong, and well built; their complexion is usually olive, but sometimes fair and ruddy, especially among Hindus; their features are regular and well developed, and those of the Muhammadans have a decided Jewish cast, resembling the Path\u00e1ns. Captain Bates gives the following analysis of the inhabitants in an ordinary Kashmir\u00ed village. The village selected is Bijbihara, in which are 400 houses. Of the 400 houses, Muhammadan landowners occupied 80; Muhammadan shopkeepers, 65; Hindu shopkeepers, 15; Br\u00e1hmans, 8; pandits, 20; goldsmiths, 10; bakers, 5; washermen, 5; weavers, 9; blacksmiths, 5; carpenters, 4; surgeons, 2; hakims or physicians, 3; leather-workers, 5; milk-sellers, 7; fishermen, 10; carpet and blanket makers, 5; mull\u00e1s or Muhammadan priests, 12; pir zadd\u00eds or saintly devotees, 40; jakirs, 20. To these 400 houses there were 10 mosques, 8 smaller shrines, and numerous Hindu temples. The houses throughout the Kashmir valley are nearly all built after the same pattern. First there is a ground floor, in which are two chambers with the small hall of the house. The second floor contains three rooms; and the floor under the roof usually consists of one long chamber, which is used as a loft for storing firewood, kitchen stuff, and lumber. In this last the household spend the summer months.\n\nPolygamy does not appear to be very common among the Hindus in Kashmir; and with the Muhammadans the practice is confined to the wealthier classes, who are generally found in the towns. Few of the agricultural population have the means to indulge in a plurality of wives. Kashmir\u00eds, rich and poor, are passionately fond of tea, of which two kinds find their way into the market, called surati and sabzi. The surati is like English tea, and reaches Kashmir from the Punjab; the sabzi is the famous brick-tea, which finds its way into the country through Lad\u00e1kh. The Russian tea-urn, or \u2018samovar,\u2019 is a common article of household furniture in Kashmir; the shape is said to have been imitated from a Russian model brought by some travelling merchant years ago from the north.\n\nThe chief towns of Kashmir are Jamu (Jummoo), the capital, on the river T\u00e1vi, an affluent of the Chen\u00e1b, in the extreme south of the territory; Srinagar, the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja\u2019s summer residence, and the seat of the shawl and silk manufacture, situated on the Jehlam to the west of Kashmir; Islamabad, the terminus of the navigation of the Upper Jehlam; and Leh, the entrep\u00f4t of the trade between Y\u00e1rkand and\nIndia, situated near the right bank of the Indus, towards the north-east of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s dominions.\n\nThe languages of Kashmir are divided into thirteen separate dialects. Of these, Dogri and Chibh\u00e1li, which do not differ much from Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed and Punjabi, are spoken on the hills and country of the P\u00fanch and Jamu Districts. Kashmir\u00ed is mostly used in Kashmir Proper, and is rather curiously and closely related to the Sanskrit. It is not, however, the Court language, and for the purpose of a traveller through Kashmir, either Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed or Punjabi will serve. Five dialects are included under the term \u2018Pah\u00e1ri,\u2019 a language spoken by the mountaineers in the east of Kashmir. Besides these, there are two dialects of Tibetan, which are spoken in Baltist\u00e1n, Lad\u00e1kh, and Champas; and in the north-west three or four varieties of the Dard dialects of Aryan origin.\n\nThe flora of Kashmir bears a strong affinity to that of Europe. Of trees, the deodar or Him\u00e1layan cedar (Cedrus deodara) merits first notice. Its range extends from 7000 to 12,000 feet above the sea; in its most congenial locality it reaches a height of from 100 to 200 feet, and has a girth ranging from 20 to 40 feet. The deodar forests are very extensive, and of great value. The forests of Kashmir contain, among other trees, the yar (Pinus excelsa), the most widespread species of pine. There are also two other species of pine, including the chil (Pinus long\u00edfolia), and one of fir. The common yew (Taxus baccata) abounds. The elm is frequently met with, and there is said to be a forest of sandal-wood in the Kutih\u00e1r District. The cypress is common in gardens; and a species of plane-tree (Platanus orientalis), considered an exotic, is probably nowhere found more abundant or luxuriant than in Kashmir. Poplars, lime-trees, and a species of wild chestnut-tree attain great size and luxuriance. Two kinds of willow grow in the valley, and the maple and red and white hawthorn (Crat\u00e6gus oxyacantha) are common. The birch and the alder are found at great heights. Junipers and rhododendrons grow on the mountains at a height of 11,000 feet, and roses, both wild and cultivated, bloom in vast profusion. Flowers are very numerous. The crocus is cultivated for the production of saffron, which is used as a condiment and as a medicine. About 1600 lbs. of saffron are said to be yearly exported to Lad\u00e1kh.\n\nThe fruit-trees of Kashmir are the apple, pear, quince, peach, apricot, plum, almond, pomegranate, mulberry, walnut, hazel-nut, and melon. The strawberry, raspberry, and currant grow wild. There are said to be at least six varieties of grape. Of late years the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 has been devoting attention to the improvement of vine cultivation and the manufacture of wine and spirits, with encouraging results. The extent of land now under vines is considerable, and some of the\nwine and brandy produced has been reported on favourably by European visitors to Kashmir. Neither orange, lemon, nor any other species of Citrus arrives at maturity in Kashmir, as the intense cold of winter proves fatal to them. There is great variety and abundance of excellent vegetables. H\u00fcgel enumerates fifteen different sorts not known in Europe. The potato, cauliflower, carrot, rhubarb, and, in short, garden vegetables generally, may be grown of the finest description, and in any quantity.\n\nThe floating gardens of Kashmir are so peculiar as to deserve some notice. They are common on the city lake, where they yield abundant crops of fine cucumbers and melons. To form these islands, choice is made of a shallow part of the lake overgrown with reeds and other aquatic plants, which are cut off about 2 feet below the surface, and then pressed close to each other without otherwise disturbing the position in which they grow. They are subsequently mowed down nearly to the bed, and the parts thus taken off are spread evenly over the floats, and covered with a thin layer of mud drawn up from the bottom. On the level thus formed are arranged close to each other conical heaps of weeds, about 2 feet across and 2 feet high, having each at top a small hollow filled with fresh mud. In each hollow are set three plants of cucumber or melon, and no further care is required but to gather the produce, which is invariably fine and abundant. Each bed is kept in its place by a willow stake driven into the bottom of the lake. A most valuable product of uncultivated vegetation is the singh\u00e1ra (Trapa bispinosa), or horned water-nut. It grows in the Wular Lake in such profusion, that 60,000 tons are, it is said, raised every year, constituting almost the sole food of at least 30,000 persons for five months in the year. It ripens in the month of October. The nut is dried, and then formed into a flour or meal, of which cakes are made.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014In Kashmir, as in Upper India, two harvests are reaped annually. The first, or rabi, ripens about July; the second, or kharif, about two and a half months later. The chief rabi crops are wheat, barley, peas, etc.; those of the kharif are rice, Indian corn, gram, and flax. Of the total rainfall of Kashmir, which does not exceed an average of 18 inches annually, only 6 inches fall during the agricultural season in the valley. Of much greater importance than the rainfall is the snow, which falls on the mountains from November to March, and on the melting of which in the spring and summer the rice crop mainly depends for its irrigation. Heavy rains usually fall in March and April, failing which the spring crops of barley and wheat are poor. Steady showers in July are required for the rice and Indian corn crops, and further showers in September and October. The spring crop ripens in June or July, after which is an intermediate crop of Indian corn and\nother less important grains, which ripens in August and September; and finally, the rice harvest is gathered from the beginning of November. Rice forms the staple food of the people, and is the most important crop, occupying three-fourths of the cultivated area.\n\nFamine.\u2014Kashmir suffered severely from famine in the two years 1878\u201380. The wheat and barley crops in 1878 were exceedingly poor; the fruit crop was to a great extent destroyed owing to an unusually wet and cold winter; and the early autumn grains of maize and millet were partly destroyed by intense heat and blight, and partly devoured by the starving peasantry, so that scarcely any reached the State granaries. Notwithstanding a fair spring crop in 1879, famine continued to rage throughout the summer, and was not checked till the ripening of a good rice crop in the autumn. Famine was not entirely at an end till June 1880. It was caused mainly by excessive and unseasonable rainfall; and was aggravated by a heavy assessment, inadequate arrangements for collecting the land revenue, the State monopoly of grain, and the badness of the roads and communications. The mortality was very heavy, especially among the Muhammadan population; and the distress was intensified by an outbreak of cholera in 1879.\n\nManufactures.\u2014The chief manufacture of Kashmir consists of shawls, which are celebrated throughout the world. These are of two kinds\u2014those loom-made, and those woven by hand. The wool of which the shawls are manufactured is from the goats pastured upon the elevated regions of Changthan, Turfan, etc. It is also obtained from the yak and the shepherd\u2019s dog. The shawl-weavers are Muhammadans, and are the most miserable portion of the population, both physically and morally. Crowded together in small and badly ventilated workshops, earning a mere pittance (about 1\u00bdd. a day), and insufficiently nourished, they suffer from chest affections, rheumatism, and scrofula. Of the Kashmir shawls imported into Europe, France used to monopolize about 80 per cent. On the breaking out of the war between France and Germany in 1870, the shawl trade suffered a sudden collapse, which has continued till the present day, owing, it is said, to a change of fashion in Europe. There are said to be still exported shawls to the value of \u00a3130,000 annually, \u00a390,000 worth of which goes to Europe. A really fine shawl may bring as much as \u00a3300, but this is an exceptional price.\n\nAttempts are now being made to divert labour into other channels, such as the manufacture of carpets, to which trade the peculiar dexterity of the Kashmir weavers is well adapted. Great attention is also paid to the cultivation of the vine for wine-making; and in parts of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja\u2019s territory, to tea. The manufacture of woollen cloths is almost universal throughout the valley, and gives employment to the villagers throughout the long winter months. The better quality of wool is used in the manufacture of blankets, and the fine woollen cloth\ncalled *pashm\u00edn\u00e1*; of the inferior wool, coarse woollens called *patl\u00ed* are made. Silk has of late years received considerable attention, and bids fair to become one of the most important products of the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1's dominions. There is a factory at Srinagar; and in 1871, \u00a330,000 was set apart by the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 to foster the young industry. In 1872, 57,600 lbs. of silk is said to have been produced, the value of which was about \u00a312,000.\n\nThe paper produced in Kashmir has a great reputation throughout Hindust\u00e1n. A description of papier-mach\u00e9 or lacquered work is peculiar to Kashmir. The designs are by no means always on papier-mach\u00e9, being frequently done on articles of smooth wood. They consist of a delicate pattern in colours, chiefly crimson, green, and blue, drawn with a fine brush; flowers and the curved forms seen upon shawls are most commonly produced. The lapidaries of Kashmir are stated to have produced specimens of their skill and taste superior to any in Europe. The silver and gold work, of which a great deal is made in Srinagar, is exceedingly effective; and the smiths, with the rudest tools, consisting of a hammer and a few tiny chisels and punches, contrive to copy with admirable fidelity numerous designs both Oriental and European. Kashmir was long famous for the manufacture of gun and pistol barrels and sword-blades, but this trade has greatly declined of late years.\n\n**Commerce and Trade.**\u2014The principal commercial intercourse is with the Punjab, Lad\u00e1kh, and Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n. The main routes by which the merchandise of Kashmir enters India are from Srinagar, by the Banihal Pass to Jamu and Amritsar, by the P\u00edr Panj\u00e1l and Bhimbar to G\u00fajr\u00e1t, also by Akhn\u00far and the B\u00fadil Pass; and lastly, from Srinagar to Pesh\u00e1war, by B\u00e1ram\u00fala, Muzaffar\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Manserat. The great mart in the Punjab for the trade of Kashmir is Amritsar. Goods to a considerable amount pass through Kashmir from British India for the markets of Central Asia. Several main lines of road lead from the Punjab into Kashmir, and the construction of a railway between Si\u00e1lkot and Jamu has been talked of. Telegraphic communication is kept up between Si\u00e1lkot, Jamu, and Srinagar.\n\nIn 1871, an annual fair was established at Jamu, which commences on the 20th November; prizes are awarded by the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1, and during the continuance of the fair the custom duties are reduced to half the ordinary rates. The value of the trade with British territory in 1874 was estimated at \u00a3890,000; and in 1883\u201384 at \u00a3901,604, namely, imports into the Punjab, \u00a3529,013, and exports, \u00a3372,591. In addition, there is a trade between British India and Y\u00e1rkand, passing through Kashmir, valued at \u00a360,000 a year. The total trade of Leh, which is the centre of this through traffic, increased in value from about \u00a35000 in 1864 to about \u00a380,000 in 1876. In 1883\u201384, this trade,\nwhich has been falling off of late years, was valued at \u00a352,781, both exports and imports.\n\nIn 1870, a treaty was concluded with the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1, by which he agreed to abolish all transit duties on goods passing between the countries of Eastern T\u00farkist\u00e1n and British India; while the British Government agreed to abolish the export dues on shawls and other textile fabrics, and to levy no duty on goods transmitted in bond through British India to Central Asia, or to the territories of the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1. The Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 also undertook to facilitate the survey of the trade routes between his territory and Y\u00e1rkand, and consented to the appointment of Joint Commissioners (one to be nominated by the British Government) for the settlement of disputes between carriers, traders, or others using that road, in which either of the parties, or both of them, should be subjects of the British Government or of any foreign State. An officer of the British Government is stationed at Leh, and another at Srinagar.\n\nCoinage.\u2014The silver coins in circulation in Kashmir are of three classes. First, the old Harisinghi rupees, worth eight annas, introduced during the Sikh rule by Sard\u00e1r Hari Singh. They are few in number, but are for the most part of good metal and full weight. Second, the old Chilki rupees, issued by the late Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 Ghul\u00e1b Singh, and valued originally at ten annas. In consequence of irregularities in the Kashmir mint, these old chilki rupees were greatly debased; and some years ago the State found itself forced to lower the value generally to eight annas. The quantity of alloy, however, varies to the extent of many annas; and the device on the coin being a rude one, and easily imitated, the Kashmir silversmiths have freely issued their own coins along with Government money, and mixed with them as much copper alloy as they chose. These old chilki rupees are spread all over the country, and form the general circulating medium for petty trade. Third, the new Chilki rupees, issued by the present Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 about fifteen or sixteen years ago. These are of full weight, of good metal, and of the value of ten annas, say about one shilling if converted into sterling.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate of Kashmir varies according to the situation. Upon the summits of the surrounding mountains it is extremely rigorous, while in the valley it is temperate, being intermediate between that of Europe and the plains of India. The seasons in the valley are all well marked, and occur about the same time as in England. In the higher portions of the valley, the climate from the beginning of May to the end of October is mild and very salubrious, and almost as invigorating to the European constitution as that of England. In consequence of the great elevation of Kashmir, the cold of winter is considerable, being on an average much more severe than in any part\nof the British Isles, and this in a latitude lower than that of Sicily. The hottest months in the valley are July and August; the air is occasionally close and oppressive, especially for a day or two before rain, which is often accompanied with thunder and lightning. The coldest months are December and January, when the average morning temperature in the valley is a little below freezing point; ice invariably covers the surface of the lakes to a considerable distance from the banks, and about once in seven or eight years the Jehlam itself is frozen over at Sr\u00ednagar. Schlagintweit gives the following as the monthly mean temperature at Sr\u00ednagar in 1856:\u2014January 48\u00b0 F., February 45\u00b0, March 50\u00b0, April 56\u00b0, May 60\u00b0, June 70\u00b0, July 73\u00b0, August 71\u00b0, September 63\u00b0, October 57\u00b0, November 54\u00b0, December 42\u00b0 F.\n\nThere are no periodical rains as in Hindust\u00e1n; and although the annual fall upon the mountains must be very great, yet in the valley the quantity probably does not exceed 18 or 20 inches during the year. About the end of March and beginning of April, there are frequent and sudden storms in the valley, accompanied by hail and rain; spring showers are frequent during April and May. In June and September also, heavy rain is not infrequent, and there are occasional showers in July and August. The air of Kashmir is in general remarkable for its stillness. Night frosts set in as early as the middle of November. By the end of that month the trees are stripped of their leaves and the year's vegetation is killed off, a thick haze overspreads the whole valley, and the lakes and rivers send up clouds of vapour. Every movement of men or beasts raises great quantities of dust, and the haze becomes so great that even at mid-day, and under a cloudless sky, no object can be seen at a mile's distance. This murky state of the air extends for about 200 feet above the level of the valley; and those who climb beyond that height see the snowy mountains of a dazzling whiteness, and the sun shining clearly in a cloudless sky, while the low country lies hidden in dim obscurity. The first fall of snow restores the clearness of the air. This fall upon the mountains usually occurs about the beginning of November, but it is slight, and soon melted by the sun. The heavy fall begins about the middle of December, and the snow lies to the average depth of 2 feet until the middle of April.\n\nMedical Aspects. \u2014 Malaria is very prevalent throughout the valley, and fevers and affections of the bowels are common, but the other diseases peculiar to India are seldom observed. Epidemics of smallpox and cholera are not infrequent. In many villages the inhabitants suffer from goitre. In addition to the above diseases, phthisis, elephantiasis, syphilis, and scrofula are common.\n\nAdministration\u2014Law and Justice.\u2014The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kashmir forms\nhimself the ultimate Court of Appeal throughout his dominions, his decisions alone being final. The rule obtains that every suit must be instituted in the Court of First Instance, i.e. in the lowest competent to try the issue, though for the ends of justice it is not very strictly observed. In cases involving the Hindu and Muhammadan laws, the authorities are the sh\u0101stra and the shara respectively; but the majority of the text-books of the five schools of Hindu law have no force in Kashmir. After mature deliberation, the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 has caused a criminal code to be prepared, consisting of 203 sections, with punishments for each offence, differing in spirit very little from the Indian Penal Code. Political offenders and criminals under life sentences are banished to the frontier fort of Bh\u00fanji, but the bulk of ordinary prisoners are lodged in the jail near the village of Habbak, on the margin of the Dal Lake. Education has lately been encouraged by an annual grant of \u00a33000, to defray the cost of publishing translations of books teaching the European sciences, and also standard works in Sanskrit and Arabic. Dispensaries for the European and Yun\u00e1ni system of medicine have likewise been established.\n\nRevenue.\u2014The revenue of Kashmir State was estimated in 1876 at Rs. 8,075,782, or \u00a3807,578. The whole of the land in the State is considered to have been, time out of mind, the property of the ruler. During the rule of the earlier Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1s, i.e. till about the beginning of the 14th century A.D., one-sixth of the produce was paid to the State. The Musalm\u00e1n Sult\u00e1ns, who succeeded, continued at first to collect at the same rate. But they, and afterwards the Mughal Emperors of Delhi, began gradually to make enhancements, which reached their climax under the regime of the Dur\u00e1n\u00eds, by whose time half the produce in the case of rice, the staple of the Province, had come to be regarded as the rightful share of the ruler; and even to this, additions were generally made. The first Sikh Governor continued to levy the land revenue at the previously existing heavy rates. Some of the extra cesses were, however, reduced by his successor, General Mi\u00e1n Singh, about 1833.\n\nGreat frauds having been discovered in the superintendence of the crops while growing, a rough assessment was made in the following way. The grain, as it was cut, was tied up into little sheaves which a man could grasp with his two hands, the fingers meeting. It was the business of the village shakd\u00e1r, or watcher of the crops, to see that all the grain cut was so stored; and the village patw\u00e1ri, or accountant, then had to number the sheaves in the different heaps. This being done, respectable men, specially chosen for the purpose by the k\u00fard\u00e1r or governor, came round and took out of the heaps certain average sheaves, which were threshed out in their presence, the produce weighed, and the total out-turn of grain in the village thus estimated. By means of the data so acquired, the total amount of grain due to the State from the\ncircle of villages under each k\u00e1rd\u00e1r was estimated, and for that amount the k\u00e1rd\u00e1r was held responsible. This was the system uniformly adopted in the case of the rice crop; with other crops the process varied slightly. If there was a general outcry against a particular k\u00e1rd\u00e1r, or if a neighbouring k\u00e1rd\u00e1r offered to pay more for that particular circle of villages, he was turned out, and the one that offered more put in his place.\n\nThis system continued in force till the year 1860, when the valley of Kashm\u00edr was divided into chakl\u00e1\u00eds, each containing several k\u00e1rd\u00e1rships, and the collection of revenue in each chakl\u00e1 was farmed to the chakl\u00e1d\u00e1r. In fixing the amounts of grain and money to be paid by the farmer, the average amount collected during the previous five years was taken as the basis, and some remissions were made in the case of heavily taxed villages. The amount was fixed for three years, the farmer being left to share with the zamind\u00e1r the profits from extension of cultivation. In 1864-65, the crops failed extensively, and in consequence the farming system broke down; and next year the former system of division was resorted to. In 1867, the farming system was tried again, and leases fixed for a period of five years; but latterly it has been again abandoned, and the plan of taking the State share in kind is at present in practice. There is, however, no settled system throughout the country. A severe famine caused much suffering in 1878-80.\n\nA great many works have appeared on the subject of Kashm\u00edr. The earlier writers are the travellers Bernier, Jacquemont, Moorcroft, H\u00fcgel, and others; among later writers may be mentioned as of some authority the works of Dr. W. T. Elmslie, Captain Bates, Dr. T. Ince, and Mr. Drew.\n\nKashmor.\u2014T\u00e1luk or Sub-division of the Upper Sind Frontier District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; situated between lat. 28\u00b0 6' 45\" and 28\u00b0 48' N., and between long. 69\u00b0 8' 30\" and 69\u00b0 52' E. In 1872 the area was returned at 782 square miles; villages, 15; population, 25,232. In 1881, the area was 862 square miles; villages, 35; population, 43,832, namely, 25,935 males and 18,797 females, occupying 7557 houses. Hindus numbered 2770; Muhammadans, 39,980; Sikhs, 507; aboriginal tribes, 567; and Christians, 8. Revenue (1881-82), \u00a321,102, of which \u00a320,374 was derived from imperial and \u00a3728 from local sources. The t\u00e1luk contains 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 2; regular police, 45 men.\n\nKashmor.\u2014Chief town of Kashmor t\u00e1luk, Upper Sind Frontier District, Sind; situated 2 miles from the Indus river, and 86 miles north-north-east from Jacob\u00e1b\u00e1d. Lat. 28\u00b0 26' N., long. 69\u00b0 36' E. Population (1872) 956, consisting of 569 Musalm\u00e1ns (mostly of the Kalw\u00e1r tribe) and 387 Hindus (chiefly Loh\u00e1\u00f1os). Kashmor has been\ndestroyed by floods five times within eighty years, but is now protected by the Beg\u00e1ri Bandh, or embankment. A canal, 4 miles long, connects Kashmor with the Indus. Under the name of the Desert Canal, the work is being extended 32 miles into the desert country west of the town, and is expected to have a completed length of 90 miles. The telegraph line passes through the place. Considerable trade in grain. Manufactures, principally coarse cotton cloth, shoes, leather work, and turned lacquered work. Station of a mukhtiy\u00e1rk\u00e1r, subordinate jail, Government English school, dispensary, post-office, military outpost, and police station.\n\nK\u00e1shpur.\u2014Village in the north of Cachar District, Assam, among the southern spurs of the Barel (Bar\u00e1il) range. The residence of the Cachari R\u00e1j\u00e1s during the greater part of the 18th century, when Hindu influence first became powerful at their court.\n\nKasia (Kusin\u00e1gara, \u2018The City of the Holy Grass\u2019).\u2014Village in Padrauna tahsil, Gorakhpur District, North-Western Provinces; situated on the crossing of two unmetalled roads, 37 miles east of Gorakhpur town. The village contains a police station, post-office, dispensary, and is also the station of a Joint-Magistrate. It, however, derives its chief importance from its Buddhist associations and remains. Here Buddha died about 550 B.C.; and for over 1100 years Kusin\u00e1gara was a place of great importance and sanctity, and a centre of Buddhist pilgrimage. It was visited by the Chinese pilgrims, Fa Hian in the 5th, and Hiuen Tsiang in the 7th century. The latter informs us that Buddha died in a s\u00e1l forest more than half a mile from the city, at a short distance from the Hiranyakavati or Ajitavati river (the modern Little Gandak). On the scene of his death were erected three large stupas, all standing in Hiuen Tsiang\u2019s time,\u2014the largest, 200 feet in height, having been built by Asoka (250 B.C.). That monarch also erected here a pillar describing the nirv\u00e1na of Buddha, and a large vih\u00e1ra or monastery, with a recumbent statue of Buddha. The existing Buddhistic remains lie south-west of the modern village of Kasia. They consist of a lofty mound of solid brickwork styled Dev\u00edsth\u00e1n or R\u00e1mabhar-Bhaw\u00e1ni, sacred to the wife of Siva; an oblong-shaped mound with a brick stupa; a colossal statue of Buddha seated under the sacred fig-tree at Gaya; and a number of low grassy barrows regarded by General Cunningham as tombs, although his excavations did not result in any discovery of human remains. These are all the existing remains of Kasia. Its many Buddhist shrines have either been effaced by the floods of the Little Gandak, or destroyed to supply materials for more modern buildings in neighbouring villages.\n\nKasi\u00e1ri.\u2014Village in the Taml\u00fak Sub-division of Midnapur District, Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 7' 25\" N., long. 87\u00b0 16' 20\" E. Large trading village; also noted for its tusar silk cultivation and manufacture.\nK\u00e1s\u00edjor\u00e1.\u2014Village in Midnapur District, Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 17' 20\" N., long. 87\u00b0 22' 45\" E. Inhabited by colonies of matmakers, who make the finer qualities of maslandi mats, which are largely exported to Calcutta as flooring mats for the houses of European residents.\n\nK\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r (Cossimb\u00e1z\u00e1r).\u2014Decayed town in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal. Lat. 24\u00b0 7' 40\" N., long. 88\u00b0 19' E. This town, the site of which is now a swamp marked by a few ruins, may lay claim to a historical interest even superior to that of the city of Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d. Long before the days of Murshid Kul\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, who founded and gave his name to the latter city, the trade of Bengal was centred at K\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r. The different European nations who traded to India had factories here from very early times. The common name for the Bh\u00e1gir\u00e1th\u00ed in English history down to the early years of the present century was the K\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r river; and the triangular tract enclosed by the Bh\u00e1gir\u00e1th\u00ed, Ganges, and Jalang\u00ed was known in the early days of the Company as the island of K\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r. The place is said to derive its name from a legendary founder, K\u00e1sim Kh\u00e1n. Its history cannot be traced back beyond the 17th century; but even when first mentioned it appears as a place of great consequence. After S\u00e1tg\u00e1on had been ruined by the silting up of the Saraswat\u00ed mouth, and before Calcutta was founded, K\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r was the great emporium.\n\nAn English commercial agent was first appointed to K\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r in 1658; and nine years later it was decided that the \u2018Chief\u2019 at this place should be also a member of Council. In 1686, the factory at K\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r, in common with the other English factories in Bengal, was confiscated by order of the Naw\u00e1b Sha\u00edst\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n. It was restored a year or two later, and at the close of the century had become the leading English commercial agency in Bengal. In 1681, Job Charnock, the future founder of Calcutta, was Chief at K\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r. In that year, of \u00a3230,000 sent out by the East India Company as the \u2018investment\u2019 to Bengal, \u00a3140,000 was assigned to K\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r. In 1763, out of a total of \u00a3400,000 required as \u2018advances for investment,\u2019 K\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r demanded \u00a390,000, or as much as any other two agencies, excepting Calcutta. The filatures and machinery of the Company were estimated to be worth 20 l\u00e1khs of rupees, or \u00a3200,000. According to native tradition, the town was so studded with lofty buildings, that the streets never saw the rays of the sun.\n\nThe factory of the Company at K\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r owed much of its wealth, and all its political importance, to its close neighbourhood to the Muhammadan capital at Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d. But, from the same cause, it was liable to constant danger. It was a matter of common occurrence for the Naw\u00e1b to order out his troops to blockade the walled factory, whenever he had any quarrel with the English Council at Calcutta. In 1757, when the Naw\u00e1b Sir\u00e1j-ud-daul\u00e1 resolved\nto drive the English out of Bengal, K\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r felt the first effects of his anger. The fortified factory was taken without resistance, and the Englishmen, including Mr. Watts, the Resident, and Warren Hastings, his assistant, were sent in close custody to Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d. After the battle of Plassey, K\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r regained its commercial importance; but the political power formerly held by the Resident was transferred to the English Agent at the court of the Naw\u00e1b, who lived at Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nThe decay of K\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r dates from the beginning of the present century, when its climate, which had previously been celebrated for salubrity, underwent an unexplained change for the worse, so that the margin of cultivation receded and wild beasts increased. In 1811, K\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r town is described as noted for its silk, hosiery, kor\u00e1s, and inimitable ivory work, while the surrounding country was \u2018a wilderness inhabited only by beasts of prey.\u2019 In 1813, the ruin of the town was effected by a change in the course of the Bh\u00e1gir\u00e1th\u00ed, which suddenly deserted its ancient bed, and instead of following its former bend to the east, took a sweep to the west, and now flows 3 miles from the site of the old town. The channel in front of the warehouses of K\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r became a pestiferous marsh, a malarious fever broke out, and the place gradually became depopulated. The Company\u2019s filatures, however, continued to work, although the place had lost all its ancient importance, and weaving only ceased when it became impossible to compete with the cheaper cotton goods of Manchester. In 1829, a Census returned the population of K\u00e1simb\u00e1z\u00e1r at 3538. It is still (1884) the seat of the wealthiest Hindu family of the District, represented by a noble and charitable lady, the R\u00e1n\u00ed Swarnamay\u00ed, but otherwise it is quite deserted. Ruins of huge buildings and broad mounds of earth alone remain to attest its former grandeur. The chief traces of European occupation now remaining are mouldering tombstones.\n\nK\u00e1simkota.\u2014Town in the Anak\u00e1palle t\u00e1luk of Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency; 23 miles west of Vizagapatam town. Lat. 17\u00b0 39' 50\" N., long. 83\u00b0 0' 10\" E. Population (1871) 6218; (1881) 7078, namely, 3562 males and 3516 females, of whom 6703 are Hindus, 374 Muhammadans, and 1 Christian. Number of houses, 1477. The principal town of a \u2018modern proprietary estate,\u2019 and formerly a tahs\u00edli station; contains a good school. The estate is comprised of 8 villages, and was assessed at the permanent settlement at \u00a31401. K\u00e1simkota was, in Musalm\u00e1n days, a faujd\u00e1r\u00ed of the Chicacole Circ\u00e1r; and after the Northern Circars came into British hands, in 1768, it remained the head-quarters of a division. When, in 1802, the Chicacole Circ\u00e1r was transferred to Ganj\u00e1m, K\u00e1simkota remained attached to Vizagapatam. It was here that Colonel Forde\u2019s troops made their rendezvous with\nthose of Vizian\u00e1garam, previous to the battle of Condore and the taking of Masulipatam in 1758\u201359.\n\n**K\u00e1sipur.** \u2014 Western tahsil of the Tar\u00e1i District, North-Western Provinces; consisting of a damp submontane tract, chiefly covered with forest jungle or grassy savannahs, but containing a larger proportion of cultivation than the remainder of the District. Area, 188 square miles, of which 89 are cultivated. Population (1872) 71,423; (1881) 74,973, namely, males 40,347, and females 34,626. Classified according to religion, the population in the latter year consisted of\u2014Hindus, 49,263; Muhammadans, 25,670; Jains, 34; and \u2018others,\u2019 6. Number of villages, 161, of which 122 had less than five hundred inhabitants. Land revenue, \u00a39953; total Government revenue, \u00a311,758; incidence of Government revenue per acre, 1s. 1\u00bdd. The tahsil contains 1 criminal court, and 2 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00fas); strength of regular police, 30 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 128.\n\n**K\u00e1sipur.** \u2014 Town, municipality, and principal centre of population in the Tar\u00e1i District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of K\u00e1sipur tahsil; situated in a marshy plain, overgrown with grass and jungle; distant from Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d 31 miles. Lat. 29\u00b0 13' N., long. 78\u00b0 59' 50\" E. Formerly the site of an ancient city, several large excavations in the neighbourhood being attributed to the P\u00e1ndava tutor, Drona, one of the heroes of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata. These ruins have been identified by General Cunningham with the capital of the Govisana kingdom, visited in the 7th century A.D. by Hiuen Tsiang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim. At the close of the last century, Nandr\u00e1m, governor of K\u00e1sipur, made himself independent; and his nephew, Sib S\u00e1l, was in possession of the pargan\u00e1 at the date of the British annexation in 1802. The present R\u00e1ja of K\u00e1sipur, Shiur\u00e1j Singh, holds rank as a special magistrate. It is a famous place of Hindu pilgrimage, having several temples and a holy tank, where pilgrims bathe on their way to Badrin\u00e1th. Population in 1872, 13,113; in 1881, 14,667, namely, males 7555, and females 7112. Classified according to religion, there were, in the latter year\u2014Hindus, 8477; and Muhammadans, 6190.

Estimated revenue in 1881, \u00a39; tribute of \u00a36 is paid to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda.\nKasmandi Kal\u00e1n.\u2014Town in Lucknow District, Oudh; situated 4 miles east of Malih\u00e1b\u00e1d town, and 3 miles west of the G\u00fant\u00ed river. Noted as having been the seat of the Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 Kans, who was overthrown by Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad, the leader of the first Muhammadan invasion into Oudh, 1030\u201331 A.D. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Kans was slain in the battle, and there are numerous ruined tombs marking the burial-place of the chiefs who fell. A small mound of fallen bricks is pointed out as the ran-khamba or battle pillar. The present Musalm\u00e1n proprietor of the place claims direct descent from the settlers left behind by Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r. Population (1869) 1990; (1881) 1809, namely, Hindus, 1061; and Muhammadans, 748. The birthplace and residence of several Muhammadans distinguished for learning and wealth.

The north and west of the pargan\u00e1 comprises a considerable area of dense jungle, which is let out rent-free under 5 forest grants. This tract harbours herds of deer and other animals, which do much damage to the crops of the cultivators who have settled in the vicinity for the sake of grazing. The south of the pargan\u00e1 is highly cultivated by K\u00farm\u00eds. Total area, 95 square miles (including 13 square miles of forest); cultivated area, 39 square miles. Government land revenue, \u00a33871. Of the 73 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 62 are held by t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs, 4 by independent proprietors, 2 are Government villages, and 5 are held rent-free by forest grantees. Population (1869), Hindus, 29,556; Musalm\u00e1ns, 1733; total, 31,289; (1881), Hindus, 29,976; and Muhammadans, 2598; total, 31,674. Average density, 329 persons per square mile.\n\nKast\u00e1 village is a small place of about 200 houses, and a population of a little over 1000 persons, on the road from Lakhimpur to Mitauli; of no importance, and much decayed of late years.\n\nKas\u00far.\u2014Tahsil of Lahore District, Punjab, occupying the southern half of the eastern or B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b portion of the District, and lying along the banks of the Sutlej (Satlaj); situated between 30\u00b0 54\u2032 30\u2033 and 31\u00b0 27\u2032 N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 15\u2032 and 75\u00b0 0\u2032 30\u2033 E. long. Area, 794 square miles. Population (1868) 197,667; (1882) 229,798, namely, males 124,783, and females 105,015; average density, 289 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, the population in 1881 consisted of\u2014Muhammadans, 138,828; Hindus, 42,160; Sikhs, 48,136; and 'others,' 674. Of the total assessed area, in 1878\u201379, of 508,060 acres, 352,514 acres were returned as under cultivation, of which 42,462 acres were irrigated from Government works, and 89,200 acres by private individuals. The average annual area under the principal crops for the five years 1877\u201378 to 1881\u201382 is thus returned:\u2014wheat,\n169,495 acres; gram, 68,526 acres; jo\u00e1r, 31,832 acres; moth, 16,046 acres; Indian corn, 13,357 acres; barley, 20,149 acres; cotton, 7130 acres; and rice, 2052 acres. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a322,684. The administrative staff consists of 1 Assistant or extra-Assistant Commissioner, 1 tahsild\u00e1r, and 1 munisif. These officers preside over 3 civil and 2 criminal courts. For police purposes, the tahsil is divided in 5 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 137 men, besides 224 village watchmen (chaukiddrs).\n\nKas\u00far.\u2014Town and municipality in Lahore District, Punjab, and head-quarters of Kas\u00far tahsil; situated upon the north bank of the old bed of the Beas (Bi\u00e1s), upon the Firozpur (Ferozepore) road, 34 miles south-east of Lahore city. Lat. 31\u00b0 6' 46\" N., long. 74\u00b0 30' 31\" E. Tradition refers its origin to Kush, son of R\u00e1ma, and brother of Loh or Lav, the founder of Lahore. Certainly, a R\u00e1jput city seems to have occupied the modern site before the earliest Muhammadan invasion; but Kas\u00far does not appear in history until late in the Musalm\u00e1n period, when it was settled by a Path\u00e1n colony from the east of the Indus. These immigrants entered the town in the reign either of B\u00e1bar or of his grandson Akbar, and founded a considerable principality, with territory on either side of the Sutlej (Satlaj). When the Sikhs rose to power they experienced great opposition from the Path\u00e1ns of Kas\u00far; and though the chiefs of the Bhangi Confederacy stormed the town in 1763, and again in 1770, and succeeded for a while in holding the entire principality, the Path\u00e1n leaders re-established their independence in 1794, and resisted many subsequent invasions. In 1807, however, Kutab-ud-d\u00edn Kh\u00e1n, their last chieftain, was forced to give way before Ranjit Singh, and retired to his property at Mamdot, beyond the Sutlej. The town of Kas\u00far was then incorporated with the Lahore monarchy. It consists of an aggregation of fortified hamlets, standing on the upland bank, and overlooking the alluvial valleys of the Beas and the Sutlej. The Afgh\u00e1n element has now declined.\n\nKas\u00far is now the most important town in the District after Lahore. It consists of twelve hamlets, four of which joined together form the main town, while the others are scattered a short distance around. Population (1868) 15,209. In 1881 it was 17,336, namely, males 8870, and females 8466. Classified according to religion, the population in 1881 consisted of\u2014Muhammadans, 13,852; Hindus, 3074; Sikhs, 242; and Jains, 168. Number of houses, 3830. The municipal income of the town, which in 1875-76 amounted to \u00a31218, had by 1882-83 increased to \u00a32686; average incidence, 3s. 1\u00bdd. per head. The situation of the town affords considerable facilities for drainage. The main streets are paved and furnished with central and side drains, and a sufficient conservancy establishment is maintained. The town is the centre of a local trade in country produce. The only\nmanufacture is leather, especially harness, for which the place has a considerable reputation. An extra-Assistant Commissioner is stationed here in charge of the Sub-division. His court, the tahsili, police station, school-house, dispensary, and d\u00e1k bungalow are the public buildings. Kas\u00far is now connected with Lahore and Firozpur by the Raiwind-Firozpur branch of the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway. The town contains a school of industry founded by a former Deputy Commissioner, and maintained out of local charities. It chiefly produces rugs and carpets, in imitation of those of Persian manufacture.\n\n**Katahra** (or **Katera**).\u2014Town in Jh\u00e1nsi District, North-Western Provinces; situated 30 miles from Jh\u00e1nsi town, and 15 from Mau (Mhow). Population (1881) 4463. Station of the Great Trigonometrical Survey. Local manufacture of pottery. Village school.\n\n**Katak** ('The Fort').\u2014District, Sub-division, and city, Orissa.\u2014See Cuttack.\n\n**K\u00e1t\u00e1kh\u00e1l** ('New Cut').\u2014Offshoot of the Dhalesw\u00e1ri river, in the south of Cachar District, Assam; said to have been formed by one of the Cach\u00e1ri R\u00e1j\u00e1s, who constructed an embankment across the main channel of the Dhalesw\u00e1ri, about 25 miles above its junction with the Bar\u00e1k. The K\u00e1t\u00e1kh\u00e1l now carries off the greater part of the stream, and is navigable by boats of 20 tons burthen all the year through.\n\n**K\u00e1t\u00e1l.**\u2014A peculiar geological formation of country covered with thorn jungle, and extending over the east and north-east of Maldah District, Bengal. This tract extends north-east and south-east from the di\u00e1r\u00e1 or alluvial land, some six miles west of the Mah\u00e1nadi river, to the borders of Din\u00e1jpur. It contains no large forests, but consists of a continuous waste of jungly high lands rising out of swamps. These high lands are covered with a thorny tree jungle called k\u00e1t\u00e1l (whence the tract takes its name). It is broken by narrow steep water-courses called karis or n\u00e1l\u00e1s, and is very thinly inhabited. The country shows traces of having been at one time occupied by a considerable population, which is reported to have been swept away by pestilence. Many tanks are to be seen, some of them of grand proportions, and scattered over a wide area. The ruins of the magnificent Muhammadan city of Panduah or Peruah, which succeeded a Hindu city of that name, are situated in the wildest and most dangerous portion of this jungle, known as the Peruah k\u00e1t\u00e1l. In former times there were probably many villages on these high lands; but at the present day there are merely a few miserable huts, inhabited by aboriginal or semi-aboriginal tribes, who mainly subsist by hunting or fishing, and raise a few crops by the rudest mode of tillage. Settlements have been recently formed by Sant\u00e1ls in various portions of this\ntract, notably in the Peruah k\u00e1t\u00e1l, where extensive clearances are being made in these long impenetrable jungles.\n\n**Katalgarh.**\u2014Town in Kum\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces; on the road from Pithoragarh to Champ\u00e1wat, 4 miles north of the latter place.

The tract consists of an open plain of average soil, bordered on one side by the Mah\u00e1nadi river, and on the other by the Son\u00e1kh\u00e1n hills. Population (1882) 15,845, namely, males 7751, and females 8094; average density, 278 persons per square mile. Number of houses, 4120.

The pool is partly artificial, being formed by the enlargement of a natural basin in the bed of the Ganiya N\u00e1l\u00e1. Just above it, stretches a strong masonry wall which once dammed up the stream, so as to enclose a large lake; but the water now escapes through the interstices and broken masses of the embankment.\n\nKat\u00e1s lies on the north side of the Salt Range, 16 miles from\nPind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n, and 18 from Chakw\u00e1l; elevation above sea-level, over 2000 feet. Walls, towers, and brick ruins crown the surrounding heights, while a fort once stood upon the neighbouring hillock of Kotera. Below these remains, an enclosure contains the ruined S\u00e1t Gh\u00e1ra or seven temples, with another group, which General Cunningham ascertained to be twelve in number. The latter resemble in their general style the Kashmir order of architecture, characterized by dentils, trefoil arches, fluted pillars, and pointed roofs. Although the details cannot now be accurately discriminated, enough remains to prove with considerable certainty that the buildings belong to the Karkota and Varmma periods, from 625 to 939 A.D., during which epoch the Salt Range formed part of the Kashmir dominions. Popular tradition assigns the origin of the seven temples to the P\u00e1ndava brethren, who are said to have lived at Kat\u00e1s during a portion of their twelve years' wanderings. The temples have suffered much from restoration and repairs, the whole wall of the central shrine being now hidden by a thick coat of plaster, the gift of Ghul\u00e1b Singh. General Cunningham inclines to believe that Kat\u00e1s may be identified with the capital of the Sinhapur kingdom, visited in the 7th century A.D. by Hiuen Tsiang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim. Some of the existing remains may possibly date back to the Buddhist period. Kat\u00e1s, as it exists at present, consists of a large square-shaped pool, set among rocks and apparently welling up from a spring in the dry bed. Round this pool a little Hindu colony of Br\u00e1hmans and fak\u00edrs has arisen, who quarrel over the offerings of the pilgrims. A large fair is held here at the beginning of the hot weather.\n\n**Kat\u00e9ra.**\u2014Town in Jh\u00e1nsi District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Katahra.\n\n**Kathi.**\u2014Petty Mehw\u00e1s State in the Taloda Sub-division of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency; estimated area, about 300 square miles. The population in 1881 was returned at 10,223. Kathi is situated in the north-west corner of the Taloda Sub-division. It consists of a succession of narrow valleys separated by ridges of lofty, irregular, and forest-clad hills of the S\u00e1tpura range; difficult of access on all sides. Two routes are practicable for bullocks and horses, one from the southwest, from Kukarmunda village, across the Imli pass; and the other from the east, from Dhadg\u00e1on village of Akr\u00e1ni pargan\u00e1. In the low-lying villages the soil is good, yielding rice and pulse. The forest products are timber, mahu\u00e1 flower, honey, and wax. The chief has no patent allowing adoption, and in point of succession his family follows the rule of primogeniture. The present chief, a Hindu Bhil, claiming R\u00e1jput origin, is a minor, and the State is under British management. Estimated revenue in 1882, \u00a32230; tribute of \u00a313 is paid to the British Government.\nK\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r (or Sur\u00e1shtr\u00e1).\u2014The peninsula or western portion of the Province of Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency, situated between 20\u00b0 41\u2032 and 23\u00b0 8\u2032 N. lat., and between 68\u00b0 56\u2032 and 72\u00b0 20\u2032 E. long.\n\nA square peninsula, standing boldly out into the Arabian Sea between the smaller projection of Cutch (Kachchh) and the straight line of the Gujar\u00e1t coast. Its physical features suggest that it may once have been an island or a group of islands of volcanic origin. On the south and west K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r is bounded by the Arabian Sea; on the north by the Gulf and Runn of Cutch; on the east by the S\u00e1barmati river and the Gulf of Cambay. It was known to the Greeks and Romans under the name of \u03a3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7; the Muhamma-dans called it by the Prakritized name of Sor\u00e1th, and to this day a large division in the south-west, 100 miles in length, still retains that name. Another tract, quite as large, to the east of the centre, however, has long been known as K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, from having been overrun by the K\u00e1this, who entered the peninsula from Cutch, in the 13th and 14th centuries; in the 15th, the whole tribe was driven out of Cutch, and in that and in the following century conquered a considerable territory. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who came into contact with them in their forays, and were sometimes successfully repelled by them, extended the name of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r to the whole Province, and from them we have come to apply it in a similar wide sense; but by Br\u00e1hmans and the natives generally it is still spoken of as Sur\u00e1shtr\u00e1.\n\nThe extreme length of the peninsula is about 220 miles, its greatest breadth about 165 miles, its area about 23,300 square miles, and its population (1881) about 2,500,000; estimated yearly revenue, \u00a31,530,000. Of these totals, about 1320 square miles, 148,000 people, and \u00a310,900 of revenue belong to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r; about 1100 square miles, 160,000 people, and \u00a326,600 of revenue belong to Ahmadabad District; about 7 square miles, 12,636 people, and \u00a33800 of revenue belong to the Portuguese possession of Diu; while the remainder is the territory forming the Political Agency of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, described in the following article.\n\nK\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r.\u2014A Political Agency subordinate to the Government of Bombay, established in 1822, having under its control 187 separate States, great and small, whose chiefs have divided among themselves the greater portion of the peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. Of the 187 States, 13 pay no tribute, 105 are tributary to the British Government, 79 to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, while 134 pay also a tribute to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh. Area, 20,559 square miles. Population (1881) 2,343,899.\n\nK\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r Agency is divided for administrative purposes into four pr\u00e1nts or divisions,\u2014Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r, H\u00e1l\u00e1l, Sor\u00e1th, and Gohelw\u00e1r,\u2014but the old territorial pr\u00e1nts are ten, namely, Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r, in the north, containing about 50 States; Machhuk\u00e1nth\u00e1, west of Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r; H\u00e1l\u00e1l, in\nthe north-west, embracing 26 States; Okh\u00e1mandal, in the extreme west, belonging to Baroda; B\u00e1rd\u00e1 or Jethw\u00e1r, along the south-west coast; Sor\u00e1th, in the south; Babri\u00e1w\u00e1r, a hilly tract in the south-east; K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, a large district near the middle; Undsarviya, situated along the Satr\u00fanji river; and Gohelw\u00e1r, in the east, along the shore of the Gulf of Cambay, so named from the Gohel R\u00e1jputs, who are the ruling race in it. In this last-named division is situated the Gogha or Gogo Sub-division of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District. Municipalities have been instituted in many of the chief towns of the Province, and municipal funds are yearly voted by the States for education, vaccination, roads, and other public purposes.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Generally speaking, the surface of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r is undulating, with low ranges of hills running in very irregular directions. With the exception of the Th\u00e1ng\u00e1 and M\u00e1ndav hills, in the west of Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r, and some unimportant hills in H\u00e1l\u00e1l, the northern portion of the country is flat; but in the south, from near Gogha, the G\u00edr range runs nearly parallel with the coast, and at a distance of about 20 miles from it, along the north of Babri\u00e1w\u00e1r and Sor\u00e1th, to the neighbourhood of G\u00edrn\u00e1r. Opposite this latter mountain is the solitary Osam Hill, and still farther west is the B\u00e1rd\u00e1 group, between H\u00e1l\u00e1l and B\u00e1rd\u00e1, running about 20 miles north and south from Ghumli to R\u00e1naw\u00e1o. The G\u00edrn\u00e1r clump of mountains is an important granitic mass, the highest peak of which rises to 3500 feet in height. The principal river is the Bh\u00e1dar, which rises in the M\u00e1ndav hills, and, flowing southwest, falls into the sea at Navi-Bandar, in B\u00e1rd\u00e1, after a course of about 115 miles, everywhere marked by highly cultivated lands bordering its course. From the same hills rises another Bh\u00e1dar, known as the Sukha Bh\u00e1dar, flowing eastward into the Gulf of Cambay. Other rivers are the Aji, Machhu, Bhog\u00e1wa, and Satr\u00fanji, the latter remarkable for wild and romantic scenery.\n\nFour of the old races, the Jethw\u00e1s, Chur\u00e1sam\u00e1s, Solank\u00eds, and W\u00e1l\u00e1s, still existing as proprietors of the soil, exercised sovereignty in the country prior to the immigration of the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1s, J\u00e1rej\u00e1s, Parm\u00e1rs, K\u00e1this, Gohels, J\u00e1ts, Muhammadans, and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, between whom the country is now chiefly portioned out. As each of the important States in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r is treated in a separate article, a brief notice must here suffice for the group as a whole.\n\nThere are important wooded tracts in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, besides the G\u00edr with its 1500 square miles of forest, but insufficient attention is devoted to them by the chiefs. In W\u00e1nk\u00e1ner and the Panch\u00e1l, however, lands have been set aside for the growth of timber, and in Bhaunagar, Morvi, Gondal, and M\u00e1n\u00e1vad\u00e1r, bab\u00fal plantations have been formed. Palms, mangoes, and casuarinas have been specially planted and cared for in Bhaunagar; trunk and feeder roads are being gradually planted with\ntrees along their entire length; and several minor estates and villages are paying attention to forest conservancy.\n\n**History.**\u2014At a very early period, Sur\u00e1shtr\u00e1 was doubtless brought under the influence of Br\u00e1hmanical civilisation, and, from its position on the coast, it was most accessible to influences from the west. The edicts of Asoka (265\u2013229 B.C.) were inscribed by that monarch on a huge granite boulder between Jun\u00e1garh and G\u00edrn\u00e1r. The Saraostos of Strabo is not improbably identical with Sur\u00e1shtr\u00e1; and if so, the peninsula was included in the conquests of the Indo-Scythian kings (*circa* 190 and 144 B.C.). Its shores were well known to the Alexandrian merchants of the 1st and 2nd centuries, but there is considerable difficulty in identifying the places mentioned.\n\nOf the early history of the country we have but scanty notice. It was probably governed by Satraps under Asoka and the great Maurya kings. For about three centuries, from the 1st century B.C. to the 3rd A.D., the local dynasty of the S\u00e1h kings ruled in Sur\u00e1shtr\u00e1. After the S\u00e1hs come the Guptas of Kanauj, who apparently governed by *senapatis* or viceroys. The later *senapatis* became kings of Sur\u00e1shtr\u00e1, who placed their lieutenants at Valabhi-nagar (identified with the buried city at W\u00e1la, 18 miles north-west of Bhaunagar). When the Guptas were dethroned by foreign invaders, the Valabhi kings, whose dynasty was founded by Bhattarka, a Gupta commander, extended their sway over Kutch, L\u00e1t-desa (Surat, Broach, Kheda, and parts of Baroda territory), and M\u00e1lw\u00e1 (480 A.D.). It was in the reign of Dhruvasena II. (632\u2013640) that the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsiang visited Falapi (Valabhi?) and Sulach\u2019a (Sur\u00e1shtr\u00e1), the inhabitants of which, he says, are indifferent and not given to learning, but profit by the proximity of the sea, and engage much in trade and barter. The people he described as numerous and wealthy, and takes note of the many convents established for the benefit of recluses engaged in the contemplative piety of Buddhism.\n\nHow Valabhi fell is not known, but possibly it was subverted by Muhammadan invaders from Sind. The seat of government was then moved farther north, beyond the borders of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and remained at Anhilw\u00e1ra from 746 to 1297 A.D., during which time various petty kingdoms arose, and the Jethw\u00e1s became a powerful tribe in the west of Sur\u00e1shtr\u00e1. Anhilw\u00e1ra was sacked by the Muhammadans in 1194, and finally conquered in 1297. The Jh\u00e1l\u00e1s are said to have been settled in Northern K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r by the Anhilw\u00e1ra kings. The Gohels (now in Eastern K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r) came from the north in the 13th century, retreating before the tide of Muhammadan conquest, and conquering for themselves new seats in the decadence of Anhilw\u00e1ra. The J\u00e1rej\u00e1s and the K\u00e1this came into K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r from the west through Kutch. The sack of Somn\u00e1th, in Southern K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed in\n1024, and the capture of Anhilw\u00e1ra in 1194, were the prelude to occasional Muhammadan invasions of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. In 1394, Zafar Kh\u00e1n destroyed the temple of Somn\u00e1th. He was the father of the first of the Muhammadan kings of Gujar\u00e1t, who reigned in prosperity from 1403 to 1535, and in decadence to 1573, when Gujar\u00e1t was conquered by Akbar. The Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d kings subjected the tributary chiefs of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r; they carefully fostered commerce, and developed the ports of M\u00e1ngrol, Ver\u00e1wal, Diu, Gogo, and Cambay.\n\nAbout 1528, the coast was threatened by the Portuguese. Bah\u00e1dur, defeated by Babar\u2019s son Hum\u00e1yun, sought safety in Diu, and afterwards permitted the Portuguese adventurers to build a factory, which they turned into a fort, after having treacherously killed Bah\u00e1dur (1536). The island and fort of Diu are still a Portuguese possession. Gujar\u00e1t, after its conquest by Akbar in 1573, was ruled by Viceroys from the Court of Delhi, until the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s supplanted the imperial power. In 1705, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s entered Gujar\u00e1t, and by 1760 had firmly established their rule; but the following half-century was a time of little ease for the tributaries in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and petty wars were frequent. During the latter part of the eighteenth century, according to Musalm\u00e1n and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 custom, the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, partly for himself and partly for his over-lord the Peshw\u00e1, sent yearly a revenue-collecting army (mulk-giri) to collect contributions from the chiefs of Western and Northern Gujar\u00e1t. As this annual armed expedition caused much waste and confusion, the British Government agreed to associate itself with the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r in recovering the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 tribute from the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r States.\n\nIn 1803, some of the weaker t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs applied to the British Resident at Baroda for protection, offering to cede their territory to the Company. They were then independent of the Peshw\u00e1 and G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, with the exception of being bound to furnish contributions. In 1807, the forces of the Company and the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r advanced into K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and the chiefs entered into engagements to pay a fixed tribute to their over-lords, and to keep the peace towards each other, and maintain order within their own limits. In return, they were secured from the visitations of the mulk-giri force, which used to appear at harvest-time, and in default of payment ravaged the crops and fired the villages. Internal warfare and resistance to the supreme authority were ended in 1807\u201308 by the settlements effected by Colonel Walker; one great feature of which was that the tributes were fixed, and the work of collection was undertaken by the British Government, which also acquired the Peshw\u00e1\u2019s rights in the Province after the treaty of Poona in 1818. In 1820, the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r agreed to have his share collected and paid by the British Government.\n\nSince 1822, the sole supreme power in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r has been vested\nin the Political Agent, subordinate to the Government of Bombay. In 1831, a chief criminal court was established, with a British officer as president, to try criminals whom the local authorities themselves could not deal with.\n\nIn 1863, the States were arranged into seven classes, with varying civil and criminal powers. This classification was introduced in pursuance of reforms suggested by Mr. Kinloch Forbes, Acting Political Agent, who had drawn attention in 1860 to the need of reform in the relations of the British Government with the administration of the chiefs. A re-organization of the administrative system was accordingly introduced in 1863, on the recommendation of Colonel Keatinge. Chiefs of the first and second class exercise plenary jurisdiction, both civil and criminal; the judicial powers of the lesser chiefs are graded in a diminishing scale, the residuary jurisdiction being vested in four British political officers, each superintending a group of States, and each residing in a division with the civil powers of a District judge, and the criminal powers of a District magistrate. They commit to the sessions of the Political Agent's criminal court at Rajkot. Civil and criminal appeals lie from the Political Assistants to the Political Agent. (See Administration.) The Political Agent controls the whole system. As a rule, no appeal lies from the decision of a chief; but on presumption of mal-administration, his proceedings may be called for and reviewed.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The enumeration made in 1872 returned the population of the Province at 2,318,642, of whom 1,224,467 were males, and 1,094,175 were females. The Census of February 17, 1881, gave the following figures\u2014total population, 2,343,899; namely, males, 1,218,803; females, 1,125,096. There was therefore in the period of nine years, between 1872 and 1881, a small increase of 25,257, or something over one per cent. The Census of 1881 returned the area at 20,559 square miles; number of towns, 41; villages, 4127; occupied houses, 479,435; unoccupied houses, 185,646. The density of population was 114 persons to the square mile; number of towns and villages per square mile, 0\u00b72; houses per village, 115; houses per square mile, 32\u00b73; persons per house, 4\u00b78.\n\nOf the 4168 towns and villages in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, 1272 contained a population of less than two hundred; 1591 between two and five hundred; 887 from five hundred to one thousand; 296 from one to two thousand; 56 from two to three thousand; 29 from three to five thousand; 22 from five to ten thousand; 8 from ten to fifteen thousand; 4 from fifteen to twenty thousand; and 3 from twenty to fifty thousand.\n\nClassified according to religion, the population is distributed as follows:\u2014Hindus, 1,942,658, or 82\u00b79 per cent. of the whole; Muham-\nmadans, 303,537, or 12.9 per cent.; Jains, 96,141, or 4 per cent.; Christians, 605; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 489; Jews, 145; and 'others,' 324. Among the Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans number 146,629; R\u00e1jputs, 129,018; Darzis, tailor and calico-vendor caste, 29,352; K\u00fanb\u00eds, or cultivators, 316,838; Kol\u00eds, also cultivators, 330,840; Kumbhars, potters, who make the village earthenware, now being gradually superseded by workers in brass, 85,118; Lohars, blacksmiths, 26,178; Mhars, menial classes, 123,666; Sonars, goldsmiths, 16,502; Sut\u00e1rs, carpenters, 26,738; N\u00e1pits, barbers, 29,991; Loh\u00e1nas, 54,968; and many castes few in point of numbers, but representing the minor artisans and labourers in the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r village. The Muhammadans (of whom 256,238 are Sunnis and 47,254 Shi\u00e1s) are divided into the following tribes:\u2014Baluch\u00eds, 109; Path\u00e1ns, 7681; Sayyids, 18,656; Shaikhs, 42,187; Sindh\u00eds, 32,524; and 'others,' 202,380.\n\nThe occupations of the male adult population are sub-divided by the Census under six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every kind and members of the learned professions, 52,445; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 9144; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 43,404; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 435,221; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 176,073; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 502,516.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Before 1863, except for the criminal court of the Political Agent established in 1831 to aid the darb\u00e1rs of the several States in the trial of great crimes, interference with the judicial administration of the territories was diplomatic not magisterial; and the criminal jurisdiction of the first and second class chiefs only was defined. In 1863, however, the country underwent an important change. The jurisdiction of all the chiefs was classified and defined; that of chiefs of the first and second class was made plenary; that of lesser chiefs was graded in a diminishing scale. Four Political Assistants, resident in the four divisions of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, now exercise residuary jurisdiction with large civil and criminal powers. They commit to the criminal court of the Political Agent, to whom also civil and criminal appeals lie. Each Assistant has a subordinate who resides at the head-quarters of the pr\u00e1nt or division, and has subordinate civil and criminal powers.\n\nIn each division are several sub-divisional th\u00e1n\u00e1d\u00e1rs, holding petty magisterial powers over a circle of villages contiguous to their station or th\u00e1nd\u00e1. These th\u00e1n\u00e1d\u00e1rs administer 134 t\u00e1luks out of the whole 187 territorial divisions of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r; they have certain powers of general administration as well as judicial authority. But as the larger principalities occupy more than 15,000 of the 20,599 square miles in\nthe country, the Agency through its Assistants, sub-Assistants, and th\u00e1n\u00e1d\u00e1rs, cannot be called upon to administer more than one-fourth of the entire area. There are 20 th\u00e1n\u00e1s in the Province: The t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs are poor, ignorant, and in debt, and have only the semblance of authority. Inter-t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r relations are characterized by petty squabbles, small jealousies, and endless sub-division of the estates.\n\nThe law administered by the darb\u00e1ri tribunals of the States is the customary law of the Province, viz. the Hindu and Muhammadan religious law as modified by local or tribal usage. The larger States have procedure and penal codes based on those in use in British India. To meet a particular class of land disputes, however, a special court was established in 1873. This was the R\u00e1jasth\u00e1n\u00edk Court, constituted with the assent and at the cost of the chiefs. It decides, under the presidency of a British officer, all disputes as to gir\u00e1s or hereditary estates, between the chiefs and the bh\u00e1y\u00e1ds and mulgir\u00e1s\u00ed\u00e1s, who are for the most part the kinsmen of the chiefs, or the descendants of earlier holders who have been unlawfully or oppressively deprived of their estates. It surveys and maps out the gir\u00e1s\u00ed\u00e1s estate, fixes his miscellaneous dues, and defines his relation to his chief by laying down the extent of his municipal and political obligations. The term of the court's existence was fixed to expire in 1884; but as at the close of 1883\u201384 there remained on the file 488 cases for disposal, the chiefs have requested an extension of the term. The court was originally established for three years; in 1876, by desire of the chiefs, another five years were allowed to it; again, in 1881, three years were added to its existence. In 1880\u201381, the court decided 192 cases; 58 per cent. of them in favour of the gir\u00e1s\u00ed\u00e1s or claimants to the estates.\n\nThere is no general police in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. The chiefs are bound by stipulation to preserve order and indemnify loss through crime committed in their territory. Each State, however, may be said to have a police of its own more or less organized. In 1882\u201383, the States maintained a force in the aggregate of 5819 foot and 1022 mounted men, at a cost for the year of \u00a383,129. In that year 11,639 offences were reported, and 12,836 persons were arrested, of whom 6641 were convicted and 5272 acquitted. Conviction is generally sought to be secured through the agency of an informer. The daily average of prisoners in R\u00e1jkot jail was 76. At the present time life and property are as safe in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r as in the Districts of British India.\n\nCommunications.\u2014The Bhaunagar-Gondal Railway, named after the States by which it was constructed, is situated wholly within K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and is 193 miles in length: gross earnings for 1882\u201383, \u00a387,680; net earnings, \u00a335,460, representing a profit of 3\u00bd per cent. on the original capital of \u00a3885,000. The following stations are between\nBhaunagar and Wadhwan, the termini of the line: Ghadechi, Vartej, Sihore, Songad, Sanashra, Dhola (Junction), Ujalvar, Ningala, Botad, Kundi, Rampur, Chuda, and Limbdi. A branch line runs from Dhola to Dhoraji, 121 miles, with 10 intermediate stations. Several new lines of railway are in contemplation, the most important being from Wadhwan to Rajkot and Navanagar, Jetpur to Junagarh and Verawal, Dhoraji to Upleta and Katiyana, Chitral to Amreli, and Surgad to Palitana.\n\nThe main roads of Kathiawar converge on Rajkot, the residence of the Agent. New roads are built out of an annual grant of \u00a36315, collected from the chiefs. On works of public improvement, the different States expended \u00a3245,000 during 1882-83.\n\nEducation has made rapid strides of late years. In 1858, there were 29 schools and 1909 students, which in 1881 had grown to 599 schools with 33,000 scholars; while at the Rajkumar College (with, in 1882, 35 pupils), and 3 high schools, the advantages of a liberal education are enjoyed by many of the chiefs during their minority. The amount spent by the chiefs on education during the year 1882-83, exclusive of the cost of the Rajkumar College and girasi school, was \u00a323,100. The total number of post-offices in the Province in 1882 was 132; and all the larger villages are supplied with letter-boxes. 83,401 persons were vaccinated in 1882.\n\nAgriculture, Commerce, Trade, etc.\u2014The Kathiawar region is a wealthy one. The land, though not of extraordinary richness, is generally of fair quality and is amply watered. The cotton annually exported supplies one-sixth of the total amount of cotton shipped from Bombay to foreign countries, and a large import of bullion or grain is yearly received by Kathiawar as part of the price. The total exports in 1882-83 were valued at \u00a33,711,230, and the total imports at \u00a32,179,090. The export of cotton alone was more than \u00a33,000,000 in value, and had doubled since 1880. The imports of grain vary according to the season. The import of grain in 1882-83 was valued at \u00a3285,000; metals, timber, and sugar show an increase in the import. It is found that the railway has absorbed a great portion of the export trade from the smaller ports on the coast-line, and concentrated it at Wadhwan in the north-east, and Bhaunagar in the south-east of the Province, while the import trade on the contrary is drawn towards the minor ports. The tribute in 1882, \u00a3112,130, is but 3 per cent. on the value of the exports.\n\nThe numerous petty courts and their people form a large body of rich resident landlords, spending their rents on their estates; and the ministers, officials, and landholders, of various station and wealth, contribute to impart a brisk vitality to the progress and general wellbeing of the country. A large proportion of the public business of Kathiawar is conducted by, and at the cost of, the native Darbars; so\nthat in a Province with nearly the area of Oudh and the population of Ceylon, a Political Agent and 4 Assistants form the administrative staff. The largest rivers are in course of being bridged; in the principal towns municipal buildings and hospitals have been erected, tanks have been excavated, and wells dug. The four chief States are Dhrangadra, Navanagar, Junagarh, and Bhaunagar. Bhaunagar has taken the lead in the material development of her resources, and is the first State in India which constructed a railway at her own expense and risk. The revenue survey in the State is now completed; private enterprise has established 5 steam cotton-press factories, and there is a prosperous trade in timber. Native States in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war of secondary importance are Morvi, Porbandar (deriving importance from its fine seaport of the same name), Wadhw\u00e1n, Limbdi, Gondal, Jhinjuw\u00e1ra, and W\u00e1nk\u00e1ner. The chiefs of Morvi, Wadhw\u00e1n, and Gondal have experienced the benefits of a European tour.\n\nThe principal products of the country are cotton, b\u00e1jra, and jo\u00e1r, and in some parts sugar-cane, turmeric, and indigo, which latter product might be more largely cultivated with advantage. The chief handicrafts are gold and silver thread-making, weaving of silk and brocades, the making of red powders, of fragrant oils, of perfumed sticks and powder, of rose and other essences, inlaying ivory, and carving sandal-wood. Horses, formerly of excellent repute, are bred in large quantities, and sheep are plentiful in some parts, their wool forming, together with cotton and grain, the chief articles of export. The principal imports are cotton manufactures, metals, and sugar. Iron is found in many parts of B\u00e1rd\u00e1 and H\u00e1l\u00e1l. At Bakharla (a village belonging to the Porbandar State) there are many iron-mines, but these have been abandoned on account of want of fuel for smelting the ore.\n\nThe principal wild animals include the lion (found in the G\u00edr range), leopard, hunting cheetah, antelope, hog, hy\u00e6na, wolf, jackal, wild cat, fox, porcupine, and smaller vermin.\n\nThe lion formerly abounded all over the K\u00e1thi\u00e1war peninsula and Gujar\u00e1t; it even spread to Central India. It is now found only in the G\u00edr hill forest. Compared with the African lion, its mane is shorter, and its colour lighter. The Gujar\u00e1t lion is about the same size as the tiger, somewhat heavier in bulk, but an inch or two shorter. He is as strong, if not stronger than the tiger. He seeks the loneliest spot for his mid-day sleep, and when disturbed, does not slink away like the tiger, but walks or runs upright without any attempt to hide himself. He avoids man more than either the tiger or the leopard, and never lives near a village or hamlet. The lion is fond of his kind, and moves in family parties, three generations being sometimes found in one party. There are probably not more than a dozen lions left in the G\u00edr forest. These are strictly preserved.\nThe year 1814-15 was called the 'Rat Year,' from the famine produced by the ravages of this animal. Captain Le Grand Jacob remarked of this pest: 'They appear suddenly in dense masses past all counting, as if springing from the earth, about the harvest season. Nothing can stop them\u2014fires, ditches, and water have been tried in vain; they move along, a mighty host, eating up all that comes in their way. All at once they vanish as if by magic, and for years not one is to be seen; they are about double the size of a common rat, and are of a reddish sandy colour.'\n\nK\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r has many notable antiquities, which have been fully described by Mr. James Burgess, Arch\u00e6ological Reporter to the Government of Bombay, in his illustrated report. Besides the famous inscription of Asoka already referred to, there are a number of rock-cut Buddhist caves and temples at Jun\u00e1garh, mentioned by Hiuen Tsiang in the seventh century, and some fine Jain temples on Mount G\u00edrn\u00e1r and P\u00e1lit\u00e1na. At Ghumli, a former capital of the Jethw\u00e1s, there are extensive ruins.\n\nThe principal towns are Nawanagar, Bhaunagar, Junagarh, Rajkot (the head-quarters of the Political Agent), Porbandar, and Mangrol. The last two, as well as Verawal, are thriving seaports, with which, as well as anchorages, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r appears to be well provided, a list of no less than 60 having been compiled by the Superintendent of Indian Marine Surveys. There are 14 lights along the coast.\n\n**Kathir\u00far.** \u2014 Town in Kotayam taluk or Sub-division of Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 11\u00b0 58' 40\" N., long. 75\u00b0 31' 54\" E. Population (1871) 3954; (1881) 8177, namely, 3945 males and 4232 females; number of houses, 1251. Hindus numbered 7124; Muhammadans, 1044; and Christians, 9. The head-quarters of the British troops during the Kotiote rebellion (1796-1805).\n\n**Kathiw\u00e1ra.** \u2014 Guaranteed Th\u00e1kurate or petty chiefship under the Bhop\u00e1war or Bhil (Bheel) Agency, Central India. This small independent chiefship is situated on the western frontier of the Central India Agency, bordering Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, under the Presidency of Bombay. It is bounded on the north by Ratanm\u00e1l; on the east and south by Ali R\u00e1jpur; and on the west by Chhota Udaipur. The population, consisting of Bh\u00edls and Bh\u00edl\u00e1l\u00e1s, numbers about 500. Little or no grain is grown, and the Bh\u00edls live by hunting, or by what they purchase from Ali R\u00e1jpur with their wages as wood-cutters. The original possessors of this country were Bh\u00edls; but the ancestors of the present Hindu chief, on being driven from R\u00e1jput\u00e1na and M\u00e1lw\u00e1, took refuge in these hills, and eventually established their power over the wild and ignorant inhabitants. The present (1883) chief is Th\u00e1kur Bah\u00e1dur Singh. Revenue, about \u00a3120.\n\n**K\u00e1thm\u00e1nd\u00fa.** \u2014 Capital of Nep\u00e1l State.\u2014See Khatmandu.\nKathna.\u2014River; rising in the Moti-ka-T\u00e1l in Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur District, North-Western Provinces (lat. 28\u00b0 20' N., long. 80\u00b0 21' E.), and flowing in a south-easterly direction, it forms for some distance the boundary between Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur and Kheri Districts; it afterwards enters Oudh, and, continuing its course south-east through Kheri and S\u00edt\u00e1pur Districts, empties itself into the left bank of the G\u00famt\u00ed in the latter District in lat. 27\u00b0 20' N., long. 80\u00b0 27' E. Not navigable, but might probably be made so for small boats.\n\nK\u00e1throta.\u2014Petty State in the Sorath division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. Area, 1 square mile; consists of 1 village, with 1 proprietor. Estimated revenue in 1881, \u00a3100; tribute of \u00a35, 4s. is paid to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda. K\u00e1throta village is about 15 miles west of L\u00e1k\u00e1-p\u00e1dar. Population (1872) 244; (1881) 59.\n\nKati\u00e1ri.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Bilgr\u00e1m tahsil, Hardoi District, Oudh; bounded on the north by P\u00e1li pargan\u00e1; on the east by Barw\u00e1n and Sandi pargan\u00e1s; on the south and south-west by Bhojpur and T\u00e1ligr\u00e1m pargan\u00e1s of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces; and on the west by Kh\u00e1khatmau and Paramnagar pargan\u00e1s of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, from which it is separated by the Ganges. Originally occupied by Thatheras, Baih\u00e1r Ahirs, and Dh\u00e1nuks contemporaneously, and the ruined sites of their forts and villages are visible in all directions. The displacement of these early tribes was effected by conquest by Sombansi from Sandi, under K\u00e1nh Randh\u00edr Singh; by B\u00e1chhils from Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, under Udai and T\u00e1s; and by Katiars from near Gwalior, under R\u00e1i Deo Datt, ancestor in the thirteenth generation of the present head of the Kati\u00e1r clan, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Tilak Singh, son of the late Sir Hardeo Baksh. These families still own the pargan\u00e1, with the exception of two or three villages.\n\nKati\u00e1ri is a fertile alluvial tract, intersected by streams and channels which in flood-time connect the Ganges and R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 rivers. Its fertility is due to the nearness of water to the surface, and to the deposit of rich loam (seo) brought down by the rivers, which in heavy floods often varies from 6 inches to 2 feet in thickness. In such a season, the extraordinary spring crops more than compensate for the loss of the autumn crops drowned by the inundation. Area, 90 square miles, of which 61 square miles, or 67.45 per cent., are cultivated. The uncultivable area is returned at less than 11 per cent. of the whole. Government land revenue, \u00a35880; average incidence, 3s. 0\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area, or 2s. 0\u00bdd. per acre of total area. Staple products, wheat and barley, which occupy nearly half of the cultivated area; and barley and jo\u00e1r, which take up another third. Of the 80 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 58\u00bd are owned by Kati\u00e1r R\u00e1jputs, 12 by Sombansi, 5 by B\u00e1chhils, 2\u00bd by Bais, and 1 each by Gaurs and Br\u00e1hmans. Tenures are as follow:\u2014T\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri, 19 villages (the estate\nof R\u00e1j\u00e1 Tilak Singh); imperfect pattid\u00e1ri, 57; and zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, 4. Population (1869) 35,164; (1881) 36,173, namely, males 20,099, and females 16,074. Predominant castes\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, Cham\u00e1rs, Kah\u00e1rs, Ah\u00edrs, Mur\u00e1os. Government schools in 5 villages.\n\nK\u00e1tigor\u00e1.\u2014Village in the west of Cachar District, Assam; on the right or north bank of the Bar\u00e1k river, near its bifurcation into the Surm\u00e1 and Kusi\u00e1ra branches. Lat. 24\u00b0 53' N., long. 92\u00b0 38' E. The Government offices at K\u00e1tigor\u00e1 consists of a tahsil, th\u00e1na, coolie d\u00e9p\u00f4t, and hospital. There is also a forest toll and registering office at Si\u00e1ltek, about a mile from the village. On the opposite bank of the Bar\u00e1k, in Sylhet District, is the old ruined fort of Badarpur, the site of which has been recently cleared of jungle.\n\nK\u00e1tipar\u00e1.\u2014Village in Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated on the banks of the Kabadak, 10 miles north of Ch\u00e1ndkh\u00e1li. Lat. 22\u00b0 46' N., long. 89\u00b0 54' E. This was one of the first spots of land reclaimed in the Sundarbans. It contains a settlement of the K\u00e1yasth or writer caste; the rest of the inhabitants are engaged in cultivation, either in the neighbourhood or in the newer Sundarban clearings farther south.\n\nK\u00e1tjur\u00ed.\u2014River of Cuttack District, Orissa. A deltaic distributary of the Mah\u00e1nadi, which branches off from the main stream soon after it enters Cuttack District. The K\u00e1tjur\u00ed itself immediately divides into two, of which the southern branch, under the name of the Koy\u00e1kh\u00e1i, passes into Pur\u00ed District. The northern branch, which retains the name of the K\u00e1tjur\u00ed, throws off the Suru\u00e1, which after a few miles rejoins the parent stream. Lower down, the K\u00e1tjur\u00ed throws off two other minor distributaries, the Large and Little Devi, which unite after a southerly course of about 20 miles, and fall into the Bay of Bengal in Pur\u00ed District under the name of the Devi. A cross stream connects the Mah\u00e1nadi with the K\u00e1tjur\u00ed, which latter river ultimately falls into the Bay of Bengal under the name of the Jotdar.\n\nKatn\u00e1.\u2014River of Bh\u00e1galpur District, Bengal; formed by the united waters of the Talab\u00e1, Parw\u00e1n, and Loran. It is a considerable stream, navigable by boats of about 15 tons burden; and after a course of about 12 miles, falls into the T\u00edljug\u00e1 in Monghyr District, in lat. 25\u00b0 34' N., long. 86\u00b0 46' 30\" E.\n\nKatoghan.\u2014Village in Kh\u00e1ga tahsil, Fatehpur District, North-Western Provinces; situated on the Grand Trunk Road, about 24 miles from Fatehpur town and 4 from Kh\u00e1ga, in lat. 25\u00b0 45' 10\" N., long. 81\u00b0 11' 32\" E. Population (1881) 2896, the prevailing class being Lodh\u00e1s. Encamping ground, police station, and large sard\u00ed (native inn).\n\nKatol.\u2014North-western tahsil or revenue Sub-division in N\u00e1gpur District, Central Provinces; situated between lat. 21\u00b0 9' and 21\u00b0 31' N., and between long. 78\u00b0 17' and 79\u00b0 6' E. Area, 797 square miles, with 362 towns and villages; number of houses, 31,490. Population (1872)\n140,201; (1881) 147,336, namely, males 73,904, and females 73,432; average density, 185 persons per square mile. The total adult agriculturists (male and female) numbered 209,568, or 38.9 per cent. of the whole, the average area of cultivated and cultivable land being 6 acres for each. Of the total area of the tahsil (797 square miles), 73 square miles are held revenue free; while 724 square miles are assessed for Government revenue, of which 447 square miles are cultivated, and 52 square miles are available for cultivation, the remainder being uncultivable waste.

The town has been in existence nearly 800 years.\n\nK\u00e1tw\u00e1 (Cutwa).\u2014Sub-division of Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal; situated between lat. 23\u00b0 28' and 23\u00b0 50' 15\" N., and long. 87\u00b0 49' and 88\u00b0 19' 30\" E. Area, 352 square miles, with 528 villages or towns, and 50,996 houses. Population (1872) 234,753; (1881) 230,209, showing a decrease of 4544 in nine years. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 183,036, or 79.5 per cent.; Muhammadans, 47,159, or 20.0 per cent.; and Christians, 14; total, 230,209, namely, 108,830 males and 121,379 females.

Besides the usual Government courts and buildings, K\u00e1tw\u00e1 contains an aided English school and a charitable dispensary. It is also one of the principal seats of District trade, and the residence of many wealthy native merchants.\n\nNow a purely commercial town, K\u00e1tw\u00e1 was formerly considered the key to Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d. In the early part of the 18th century, the neighbourhood suffered much from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, whose yearly raids depopulated the villages along the banks of the river, and converted the country into jungle. The old fort of K\u00e1tw\u00e1, of which scarcely a vestige now remains, was situated on a tongue of land at the confluence of the Aj\u00e1i and Bh\u00e1gir\u00e1th\u00ed, and is noted as the scene of the defeat of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s by Al\u00ed Vardi Kh\u00e1n. It was a mud building, half a mile in circumference, and mounted 14 guns. K\u00e1tw\u00e1 is considered sacred by the Vaishnavs, as having been the place where their apostle, Chaitanya, took upon himself the life of an ascetic.\n\nA scheme for the construction of a light railway from Bardw\u00e1n to K\u00e1tw\u00e1 by a private syndicate has been approved by Government, and the necessary steps have been taken for starting the undertaking. Up to the end of the year 1883\u201384, however, the concessionaires had not succeeded in raising the necessary capital, and as late as January 1885 no commencement had been made of the work.\n\n**K\u00e1t\u00fd\u00e1r.**\u2014Village in Guni t\u00e1luk of Tando Sub-division, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; situated eleven miles west of Tando Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, and twenty miles from Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d city. The head-quarters of a tappad\u00e1r. Population (1881) under 2000. The Musalm\u00e1ns are chiefly landed proprietors, cultivators, weavers, dyers, and saddle-cloth makers. The Hindus are traders, goldsmiths, and cultivators. Trade and manufactures unimportant, consisting mainly of cloth, grain, gh\u00ed, mats, and saddle-cloths. Good staging bungalow (travellers\u2019 rest-house). The village dates from the time of the Kalhora dynasty.\nKaundha.\u2014Town in Hardoi District, Oudh; situated on the Sh\u00e1h-\u00e1b\u00e1d road, 5 miles north-west of Hardoi town. An agricultural village, inhabited chiefly by Cham\u00e1r Gaurs, whose ancestors dispossessed the Thatheras in the latter days of the Kanauj kingdom. These Gaurs have always had a bad reputation for turbulence and refractoriness. On one occasion, during the native government, their village was burned in retaliation for their having murdered the son of a Musalm\u00e1n chakl\u00e1d\u00e1r. Even at the present day, their one redeeming quality is said to be that they are not addicted to female infanticide. Population (1869) 2186; (1881) 1737. Bi-weekly market. Government school.\n\nK\u00e1uniy\u00e1.\u2014Village and station on the Northern Bengal State Railway, in Rangpur District, Bengal; situated on the right bank of the T\u00edst\u00e1 river. Considerable exports of jute and tobacco.\n\nKauri\u00e1la (also called Karn\u00e1l\u00ed).\u2014River, rising in Tibet, not far from one of the sources of the Sutlej (Satlaj), in lat. 30\u00b0 43' N., and long. 80\u00b0 47' E. After leaving Tibet through the Takl\u00e1 Khar, or Yari Pass, it flows through Nepal generally in a south-easterly direction till it emerges from the lower range of the Himalayas, through a deep, picturesque gorge, known as the Sh\u00edsha P\u00e1n\u00ed, 'crystal waters.' The stream here is about 300 yards broad and of great depth, with a slow current, closely shut in by precipitous mountains, 2500 feet high. A little below Shisha P\u00e1n\u00ed, the channel widens, with a steeper and rockier descent, causing magnificent rapids nearly half a mile broad. Lower down, the river divides into two, the western branch retaining the name of Kauri\u00e1la, the eastern being called the G\u00edrw\u00e1. A few years ago, the latter was a mere stream, but its volume has gradually increased till now it is considerably larger than the Kauri\u00e1la. They are both rapid rivers, with pebbly beds, and fords which an elephant can generally cross without difficulty. Eighteen miles from its point of exit from the hills, it enters British territory at the point where it receives the Mohan; and marks the boundary between the Oudh Districts of Kheri and Bahraich. In its course it receives as tributaries on the west bank its former offshoot, the G\u00edrw\u00e1; and on the east, the Chauka and Sar\u00e1da, or Sarju. From the point of confluence with the latter stream, the united rivers become the Gogr\u00e1; and under this name it ultimately falls into the Ganges on its left bank, in lat. 25\u00b0 46' N., long. 84\u00b0 40' E., a little above Dinapore. The Kauri\u00e1la is navigable by large boats of about 17 tons burden beyond the limits of British territory. The principal river trade is the export of grain, and of timber, ginger, pepper, wax, gh\u00ed, and catechu from Nep\u00e1l. Gold-washing is carried on by a caste called after their occupation Son\u00e1his. Fish are abundant.\n\nKauriy\u00e1.\u2014Zamind\u00e1ri estate in R\u00e1ipur tahsil, R\u00e1ipur District, Central\nProvinces; about 80 miles east of R\u00e1ipur town, on the Sambalpur road.

The tract is hilly, especially the west, and is covered with splendid forest. The chief heights are Kavale-durga, Kabbinada-gudda, and Kundada-gudda, the last being a conspicuous point. From Kabbinada-gudda, ironstone of a superior quality is obtained, the iron made from which the natives hold to be as good as steel. The principal productions are areca-nut, pepper, cardamoms, rice, and coffee. Sugar-cane is also grown to a small extent. Coffee was introduced in 1847, and the cultivation has gradually increased. The only manufactures are stone jugs at Kavale-durga town, and silver cups at Tirtha-halli. The cultivated area is estimated at about 162 square miles; cultivable, 52 square miles; and uncultivable, 62 square miles. The revenue is returned at \u00a343,767.

The tank is enclosed by a band or embankment four miles long. It is fed by a channel from the Pal\u00e1r, and in its surplus weir are the head-waters of the Cortelli\u00e1r, which supplies Madras city with drinking water. The nominal area of cultivable land under this tank is about 40,000 acres, but deposits of silt have greatly impaired its efficiency. Wild duck and other water-fowl are abundant. Clive here gained a complete victory over the French in 1752. The battle was fought in the moonlight. The fort\nof K\u00e1verip\u00e1k, close to the town, was held by French and English in turn during the wars of the Karn\u00e1tic.

The high priest of the Kab\u00edrpanth\u00ed sect also lives here, and his presence attracts devotees from all parts of India.\n\n**Kaw-ka-dw\u00fat.** \u2014 Village in the B\u00edlin (Bhileng) Kyaik-hto township, Shwe-gyin District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. The village is on the high-road from B\u00edlin to Kyaik-hto, where it crosses the Thaiphyu river. Population (1877) 1333; (1881) 1443, chiefly agriculturists and fishermen; number of houses, 233. Local revenue, \u00a326. Police station; cattle market in the dry season twice a week.\n\n**Kaw-ka-reit.** \u2014 Head-quarters of the Haung-tharaw township, Amherst District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. A straggling village on both banks of a small stream of the same name, here spanned by a wooden bridge. Population (1876) 2135; (1881) 2146. Weekly cattle market.\n\n**K\u00e1yal** (the *Cail* of Marco Polo). \u2014 Ancient port in Tenkar\u00e1i Sub-division, Tinnevell\u00ed District, Madras Presidency. Known as Kail or Koil, it was long a famous coast town. Marco Polo landed here, and describes it as belonging to Ashar, the eldest of five brothers who reigned in the Maabar or Malab\u00e1r and Tinnevell\u00ed regions. Rashid-ud-d\u00edn, a contemporary of Polo, also mentions it as a Malab\u00e1r port. Abdurraz\u00e1k names it as \u2018a place situated opposite the island of Serendib, otherwise called Ceylon.\u2019 Nicholas Conti calls it Cahila, the site of a pearl fishery. Vasco da Gama, writing the word Caell, notices that with a K\u00e1f\u00edr (Christian) people, it had a Muhammadan king. Bishop Caldwell, deriving the name from K\u00e1yal, a lagoon or backwater, places Marco Polo\u2019s *Cail* on the T\u00e1mraparn\u00ed river, half-way between Korkai village and the sea, at an insignificant place now called Old K\u00e1yal (Palaya K\u00e1yal). Korkai he identifies with the \u2018Kolkoi emporium\u2019 of Ptolemy. Korkai, now five miles inland, was originally on the coast. As the silt accumulated in the sea near the\nmouth of the river, or as the line of the coast rose, or from both causes, Korkai was found at length to be too far inland for the convenience of a sea-borne trade. K\u00e1yal, the Cail of Marco Polo, rose in its stead on the sea-shore, and attained to still greater dimensions. K\u00e1yal has in its turn sunk to a petty village inhabited partly by Muhammadans and partly by Roman Catholics. Population (1881) 944. For two or three miles north of the present village of K\u00e1yal, and a mile and a half inland as far as Maramangalam village, the whole plain is covered with broken tiles, remnants of Arabian and other pottery and China porcelain.\n\nK\u00e1yalpatnam (or Coilpat\u00e1m).\u2014Town and port in Tenkar\u00e1i taluk or Sub-division, Tinneveli District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 8\u00b0 33' 30\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 10' E.; 18 miles south of Tuticorin. Population (1871) 11,197; (1881) 11,806, namely, 4519 males and 7287 females. Hindus numbered 4170; Muhammadans, 7445; and Christians, 191; number of houses, 2792. The seaborne trade, which is carried on by Labbays, is estimated at \u00a320,000, chiefly in pearls and precious stones; rice and cocoa-nuts from Ceylon; timber and areca-nuts from Travancore; and palmyra jagari (crude sugar). Large salt manufacture. The port was formerly of importance, but has now been superseded by Tuticorin. K\u00e1yalpatnam was supposed to have been probably the ancient Cail of Marco Polo. But Bishop Caldwell's interesting and conclusive investigations fix the site of Cail about 8 miles to the north-west.\u2014See KAYAL.\n\nKayan (or Ken).\u2014River of Central India.\u2014See Ken.\n\nK\u00e1yenkolam (Quilon).\u2014Seaport on the backwater of the same name, Travancore State, Madras Presidency. Lat. 8\u00b0 53' 28\" N., long. 76\u00b0 36' 59\" E.; containing about 3000 inhabitants. This old town was formerly the capital of an independent State, Quilon; and is near the supposed site of the ancient Nel Kynda. In 829 A.D., the Syrian Church was founded here. Captured by the Dutch in 1661. In 1745, the R\u00e1ja submitted to Travancore; and fifteen years later, the State was finally absorbed by its more powerful neighbour.\u2014See Quilon.\n\nK\u00e1z\u00edp\u00e1r\u00e1.\u2014Village in the Bar\u00e1sat Sub-division, District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal; situated about 1\u00bd mile from Bar\u00e1sat town, and included within the Bar\u00e1sat municipality. Lat. 22\u00b0 43' 45\" N., long. 88\u00b0 33' E. The site of a large annual fair held in December or January, in honour of a famous Musalm\u00e1n saint, P\u00edr Ekdil S\u00e1h\u00edb, which is attended by Hindus as well as Muhammadans. About 300 acres of land are held by Muhammadan priests for the maintenance of the mosque, and the due performance of religious services. An account of the legend connected with the saint, and of the miracles performed by him, is given in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. i. pp. 110, 111.\nKed\u00e1r Gang\u00e1.\u2014Mountain torrent in Garhw\u00e1l State, North-Western Provinces. According to Thornton, it rises in a snow-clad rocky gorge, in lat. $30^\\circ 54'$ N., long. $79^\\circ 5'$ E., and, after a rapid north-westerly course of 10 or 12 miles, falls into the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed, on the left side, just below Gangotri, in lat. $30^\\circ 59'$ N., long. $78^\\circ 59'$ E. It is subject to sudden floods from the melting of the snow, and therefore varies greatly in breadth and volume from time to time.\n\nKed\u00e1r K\u00e1nt\u00e1.\u2014Mountain peak in Garhw\u00e1l State, North-Western Provinces. Thornton states that this is the highest summit in the Himalayan range which separates the head-waters of the Jumna and the Tons. Lat. $31^\\circ 1'$ N., long. $78^\\circ 14'$ E. The mountain slopes gently upward on every side, so that the ascent can be easily performed from any quarter. Beds of white saccharoid limestone form the base; the summit consists of micaceous schist. Forests of oak, pine, yew, horse chestnut, and rhododendron clothe the shoulders; but the greater vegetation abruptly ceases at an elevation of 10,000 feet, leaving the remainder of its height clad only with grasses and alpine plants. Jacquemont found the summit free from snow at the end of May. Ked\u00e1r K\u00e1nt\u00e1 formed a station in the Great Trigonometrical Survey of the Himalayas. Elevation above sea-level, 12,541 feet.\n\nKed\u00e1rn\u00e1th.\u2014Famous temple and place of pilgrimage in Garhw\u00e1l District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. $30^\\circ 44' 10''$ N., long. $79^\\circ 5' 50''$ E.; lying immediately below the snowy peak of Mah\u00e1panth, at an elevation of more than 11,000 feet above sea-level, and only second in sanctity to the sister shrine of Badrin\u00e1th. It marks the spot where an incarnation of Sad\u00e1shiu or Siva, after fighting his numerous battles, attempted to dive into the earth, to escape his pursuers, the P\u00e1ndavas, but left his lower limbs above the surface in the shape of a holy rock, the remaining portions of his body being distributed elsewhere. Close to the temple rises a precipice known as Bhairab Jhamp, where devotees formerly committed suicide by flinging themselves from the summit; but the British Government suppressed this practice shortly after annexation. With Ked\u00e1rn\u00e1th are included the temples of Kalpeswar, Madhya-maheshwar, Tungan\u00e1th, and Rudran\u00e1th, the whole forming the P\u00e1nch Ked\u00e1r, a famous round of pilgrimage, containing the scattered portions of Siva\u2019s body. The R\u00e1wal or chief priest is always of the Jangam caste from Mysore. He does not officiate at Ked\u00e1r itself, but at the branch temples of Gapt, K\u00e1shi, and Ukimath, his adopted son or chel\u00e1 taking the present shrine in charge. Immense numbers of pilgrims annually visit Ked\u00e1rn\u00e1th.\n\nKedgeree (Khejiri).\u2014Village in Midnapur District, Bengal; situated on the right bank of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, near its mouth. Lat. $21^\\circ 53'$ N., long. $88^\\circ$ E. Close by is an old English burial-ground, dating from the times when vessels of any draught did not come up to Calcutta,\nbut anchored near the mouth of the river or at Diamond Harbour. Kedgeree was formerly a telegraph station, which has now been removed to the opposite side of the H\u00fagl\u00ed.\n\n**Kediw\u00e1ri.**\u2014One of the mouths by which the Indus empties itself into the sea. Lat. 24\u00b0 2' N., long. 67\u00b0 21' E. Formerly the main channel of the river, with a depth of from 16 to 18 feet, and navigable by large boats and Government river steamers; but since 1845, the Hajamro, which in that year was only suited for the passage of small boats during floods, has gradually increased in volume, till it has taken the place of the Kediw\u00e1ri, and is now the largest of the Indus mouths.\n\n**Keitha (Kaitha).**\u2014Village in Rath tahsil, Ham\u00edrpur District, North-Western Provinces; lying on the road from R\u00e1th to J\u00e1itpur, 56 miles south-west of Ham\u00edrpur town. Lat. 25\u00b0 31' N., long. 79\u00b0 36' E. Population (1881) 1309. Occupied from 1812 to 1828 as a cantonment for British troops, but abandoned on account of the restoration of good order in the Native States after the British occupation of Bundelkhand. The English cemetery still exists, as well as the remains of a few military buildings. Police outpost; good encamping ground.\n\n**Kekri.**\u2014Municipal town in Ajmere, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Distant from Ajmere city 50 miles. Population (1876) 4885; (1881) 6119, namely, 3081 males and 3038 females. Hindus numbered 4932; Muhammadans, 913; and Jains, 274. Formerly a thriving commercial town, but of late years declining in importance. Municipal income (1880\u201381), \u00a3622; expenditure, \u00a3496. Water-supply scarce and bad. Headquarters of a Deputy Magistrate. Post-office and dispensary.\n\n**Keladi.**\u2014Village in S\u00e1g\u00e1r t\u00e1luk, Shimoga District, Mysore State, Southern India. Lat. 14\u00b0 13' 16\" N., long. 75\u00b0 3' 41\" E. Population (1871) 1064; (1881) 1249. Cradle of a family of local chieftains or palegars, who rose to power in the 16th century, and successively removed their capital to Ikkeri and Bednur or N\u00e1gar. The principal building now standing is a large, plain temple to R\u00e1meswara and V\u00edrabhadra. While two brothers were ploughing a field, the ploughshare of one of them struck against a buried caldron, which contained treasure. Afraid to disturb it, he dreamt that it was desirable to offer a human sacrifice. On hearing this, their two slaves volunteered to be victims on condition that their memory should be preserved. Two mounds are still pointed out as the scene of these human sacrifices. With the accession of the wealth thus obtained, the brothers raised a small force and began to subdue the neighbouring villages. But they were seized and sent to Vijayanagar, and there put into custody. Hearing that a palegar had rebelled, they sought permission to be allowed to punish him. In this they succeeded; and as a reward were confirmed in the possession of the places they had captured.\nKelapur.\u2014Taluk of Wun District, Berar. Area, 1079 square miles; contains 275 villages, with 14,737 occupied and 936 unoccupied houses. Population (1881) 78,814, namely, 40,194 males and 38,620 females, or 73 persons per square mile. Villages per square mile, 0.25; houses per square mile, 14.5; persons per house, 5.4. Hindus numbered 53,181; Muhammadans, 2402; Jains, 168; aboriginal tribes, 23,006; Sikhs, 56; and Christian, 1. Area occupied by cultivators, 248,941 acres; number of persons engaged in agriculture, 55,060. Total assessed area, 481 square miles; total assessment, \u00a37672; local cesses paid on land, \u00a3569. In 1884, the taluk contained 1 civil and 1 criminal court; police stations (thanas), 8; regular police, 76 men; village watchmen (chaukidars), 82.\n\nKeljhar.\u2014Village in Wardha tahsil, Wardha District, Central Provinces; about 16 miles north-east of Wardha town, on the old Nagpur and Bombay high-road. Lat. 20\u00b0 51' N., long. 78\u00b0 51' E. Said to occupy the site of the ancient city of Chakranagar, which was preyed upon by a demon as related in the sacred book Bharat. In the gateway of what remains of a well-built fort, stands a famous image of Ganapati, in whose honour a yearly fair is held on the fifth day of Magha Suddha, or about the end of January.\n\nKelod (Kelwad).\u2014Town in Katol tahsil, Nagpur District, Central Provinces; at the foot of the Satpura Hills, about 7 miles north of Sioner, on the main road to Chhindwara. Lat. 21\u00b0 27' 30\" N., long. 78\u00b0 55' E. Population (1881) 4481, namely, Hindus, 3994; Muhammadans, 376; Jains, 86; aboriginal religions, 25. The chief industry of the place consists of the manufacture of excellent brass and copper vessels, which are exported as far as Amrati and Raipur. Kelod also produces rough glass ornaments. Several firms of Marwari money-dealers have been long established, but their business is merely local. The town has a school, police buildings, and a market-place. According to tradition, Kelod was founded 14 generations ago by the ancestors of the present malguzar and desmukh, at the same time that a neighbouring Gauli chief formed the extensive tank at Jatghar, near the town. The fort, now almost in ruins, was probably built in the early Maratha period.\n\nKelsi.\u2014Creek on the coast-line of Ratnagiri District, Bombay Presidency; lies midway between the ports of Bankot and Suvarndurg. The entrance of the creek is narrow and difficult. Along the southern bank are a long spit of sand and a salt-marsh. The creek is navigable by small canoes for a distance of ten miles. The waters abound in fish.\n\nKelsi.\u2014Port in Ratnagiri District, Bombay Presidency; situated 64 miles north by west of Ratnagiri town, and 3 miles south-east of Bankot. Betel-nut is the chief article of export. Lat. 17\u00b0 55' N.; long. 73\u00b0 6' E. Average annual value of trade during the five years ending 1881-82\nreturned as follows:\u2014Imports, \u00a34704; exports, \u00a32572. A yearly fair is held, attended by about 25,000 people. Population in 1872, 3291. Not returned separately in the Census Report of 1881. For customs purposes Kelsi is grouped with two other ports, B\u00e1nkot and Harnai, under the Suvarndurg division.\n\n**Kelva** (or *Kelve*, *Kelve-Mahim*).\u2014Port in the Mahim Sub-division of Th\u00e1na District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See MAHIM.\n\n**Ken** (or *Kayan*; the *Karn\u00e1vati* of Sanskrit, and *Kainas* of the Greeks).\u2014River of the North-Western Provinces; rises in the Native State of Bhop\u00e1l, on the north-western slopes of the Vindhya mountains, and, flowing in a general northerly direction, past the town of B\u00e1nda, falls into the Jumna a few miles below Pail\u00e1n\u00ed. Its source, in lat. 23\u00b0 54' N., long. 80\u00b0 13' E., has an elevation of 1700 feet above sea-level. After a course of about 35 miles, it falls in a cataract over the brow of the Bandair range, at Pip\u00e1riy\u00e1 gh\u00e1t. It then takes a westerly direction, and, flowing parallel to the base of the mountains, receives the waters of the Patn\u00e1 and the Sun\u00e1r on its left bank. Traversing the Native State of Panna, it enters B\u00e1nda District at the village of Bilhark\u00e1 (lat. 25\u00b0 8' N., long. 80\u00b0 25' E.), and is there joined by its affluents, the Koil, Gawain, and Chandr\u00e1wal. After a total course of 230 miles, it falls into the Jumna, on the right bank, near Chilla (lat. 25\u00b0 47' N., long. 80\u00b0 33' E.).\n\nNumerous rapids and cataracts interrupt the bed of the Ken, and the channel is too much blocked by rocks to allow of navigation. Small craft of light burden, however, proceed in the rainy season from the Jumna as far up as the town of B\u00e1nda, a distance of 35 miles. Fish abound; and beautiful quartz or basalt pebbles, found in the bed, are in great request for the manufacture of ornaments. The natives consider the water unwholesome. In time of flood, the volume of water at Kharaun\u00ed amounts to 450,000 cubic feet per second; at B\u00e1nda, to 500,000 cubic feet. The Ken flows in a deep and well-defined bed, scoured out to a great width through the yielding clay of Bundelkhand by the flood-water. It is nowhere fordable in the rainy season. A system of irrigation canals, drawing their supplies from the Ken and the B\u00e1gain, is now (1884) under consideration. The project consists in damming up the cold-weather supply of the river by erecting a weir at Kharaun\u00ed, where it forces its way across a natural granite barrier, through an outlying spur of the Vindhya range. The proposed capacity of the canal will be 350 cubic feet of water per second, 300 of which will be drawn from the Ken, and 50 from the B\u00e1gain. The length of the main line will extend to about 50 miles, with a system of distributaries commanding a gross area of about 1000 square miles. Estimated cost, \u00a3133,309.\n\n**Kenchengudda.**\u2014Town in the Bellary Sub-division of Bellary\nDistrict, Madras Presidency; situated on the banks of the Tungabhadra. Lat. 15\u00b0 36' N., long. 76\u00b0 54' 10\" E. Population (1871) 1041; (1881) 998; number of houses, 209. Hindus numbered 898; and Muhammadans, 100. The town is now almost in ruins, but was the headquarters of one of the principal palayams or military zamindaris in former times. An old palace in the ruins has a long Hali Kanarese inscription on the ceiling of one of its chambers.\n\nKenda.\u2014Zamindari estate in Bilaspur tahsil, Bilaspur District, Central Provinces, adjoining the Lapha estate. Area, 298 square miles, of which less than 14,000 acres are cultivated; the hilly portion contains some fine sal forests, and much lac is exported to Mirzapur. Number of villages, 79; houses, 3358. Population (1881) 12,252, namely, males 6421, and females 5831. The chief is a Kunwar.\n\nKendrapara.\u2014Sub-division of Cuttack District, Orissa. Area, 1424 square miles, with 4400 villages and 99,127 houses. Population (1881), males 283,571, and females 291,541; total, 575,112. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Hindus, 564,619; Muhammadans, 9852; Sikhs, 8; Christians, 174; and 'others,' 459. Average density of population, 404 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 3; persons per village, 131; houses per square mile, 75; inmates per house, 5\u00b78. This Sub-division, which was constituted in January 1859, comprises the 4 police circles of Kendrapara, Patmundai, Tirtol, and Aul. In 1883 it contained 1 magisterial court, a regular police force 106 strong, and a village watch numbering 1114 men.\n\nKendrapara.\u2014Town, municipality, and head-quarters of Kendrapara Sub-division, and of a police circle, Cuttack District, Orissa; situated a few miles north of the Chitartala branch of the Mahanadi. Lat. 20\u00b0 29' 55\" N., long. 86\u00b0 27' 35\" E. Population (1872) 13,268; (1881) 15,696, namely, males 7616, and females 8080. Classified according to religion, the population in 1881 consisted of\u2014Hindus, 14,033; Muhammadans, 1658; 'others,' 5. Area of town site, 2880 acres. In 1883\u201384, the municipal revenue was \u00a3494, of which \u00a3421 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 6\u00bdd. During the Maratha rule, a magistrate (faujdar) was stationed here for the purpose of checking the depredations of the Rajah of Kujang, who had for centuries preyed upon the surrounding country.\n\nKendrapara Canal.\u2014A branch of the Orissa Canal System. It starts from the right flank of the Birupa weir, and proceeds along the north and west bank of the Mahanadi, and of its distributaries the Chitartala and the Nun, in a due easterly direction for 42\u00bd miles, to Marsaghai, in tidal waters, 23 miles from False Point. This canal was opened in May 1869. A branch canal, 40 miles in length, taking off from the north or left bank of the Kendrapara Canal, passing along the\nnorth bank of the Birup\u00e1 and Br\u00e1hman\u00ed, and falling into the latter river at Pat\u00e1mund\u00e1i near the Dh\u00e1mr\u00e1 estuary, has just been completed. An extension of the Kendrapar\u00e1 Canal, from Mars\u00e1gh\u00e1i towards the sea-coast, for a distance of 15 miles, was sanctioned in 1872-73, in order to improve the communication with False Point harbour, and was opened to the Jambu channel near the seaboard in July 1881. The Kendrapar\u00e1 Canal proper is designed to irrigate 385 square miles; but as less than two-thirds of this area will require simultaneous irrigation, the canal only carries water for 234 square miles, or 150,000 acres. The Pat\u00e1mund\u00e1i branch canal is intended to irrigate 113,000 acres. The extension from Mars\u00e1gh\u00e1i towards False Point is intended for navigation only. The head lock of the Kendrapar\u00e1 Canal, at the Birup\u00e1 weir, is 100 feet from sill to sill, and 17 feet wide. The sills are 59'5 feet above sea-level, and the gates 18\u00bd feet in height. The canal is divided into 7 reaches, with a width at water-line varying from 75 to 160 feet, a uniform depth of 7 feet, a fall ranging from 0 to 6 inches per mile, and a minimum capacity of discharge varying in the different reaches from 340 to 740 cubic feet per second in the dry season, and up to 2000 in the rains. The total fall of the canal from its head to its outfall at Mars\u00e1gh\u00e1i is 64 feet, the levels being adjusted by means of 8 locks, the last of which is a tidal lock at Mars\u00e1gh\u00e1i, with a fall of 10 feet, the upper sill being 6 feet above mean sea-level, and the lower sill 4 feet below. At low-water spring tide there is always 3\u00bd feet of water on the lower sill. At Mutri, in the 37th mile, is an escape or waste weir capable of discharging 360 cubic feet per second. Six syphon culverts have been led underneath the canal, and 4 traffic bridges, in addition to the lock bridges, have been constructed across it.\u2014See also MAHANADI RIVER.\n\nKenduli.\u2014Village in B\u00edrbh\u00fam District, Bengal; situated on the north bank of the Ajai. Lat. 23\u00b0 38' 30\" N., long. 87\u00b0 28' 15\" E. Birthplace of Jayadeva, a disciple of the Vishnuvite reformer Chaitanya and Sanskrit poet, the author of the celebrated Gita Govinda, a Sanskrit poem in praise of Krishna. An annual fair in honour of Jayadeva is held in the village on the last day of M\u00e1gh (the commencement of February), and is attended by upwards of 50,000 persons.\n\nKengeri (or Ten-geri, 'Southern Street').\u2014Village in the Bangalore Sub-division of Bangalore District, Mysore State, Southern India; 9 miles south-west of Bangalore city. Lat. 12\u00b0 54' N., long. 77\u00b0 2' E. Population (1871) 2155; (1881) 1819. The town was destroyed by Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n to prevent its sheltering the forces of Lord Cornwallis. In 1866, an Italian gentleman, Signor De Vecchi, attempted, with the assistance of Government, to revive sericulture in this neighbourhood. He imported cartoons of silkworm eggs from Japan, and established a steam filature at Kengeri, where the delicate process\nof winding was performed by female orphans from the Bangalore convent, under the superintendence of native nuns. But a severe drought proved fatal to the imported worms, and though the stock was twice replenished, the industry fell for a time into its former state of depression. It is, however, fast reviving, not only here, but throughout Bangalore District.\n\n**Keobrang.**\u2014Pass in Bashahr State, Punjab, over a ridge forming the boundary between Kun\u00e1war and Chinese territory. Lat. $31^\\circ 36' N.$, long. $78^\\circ 54' E.$ Thornton states that the pass lies within the Chinese boundary, but that the severity of the climate prevents their establishing an outpost on the spot, so that Europeans have repeatedly visited it. It has been found free from snow at the end of July. Elevation above sea-level, 18,313 feet.\n\n**Keonthal (Kiunthal).**\u2014One of the Punjab Hill States, under the political superintendence of the Government of the Punjab; lies around Simla Station, between lat. $30^\\circ 55' 30''$ and $31^\\circ 6' N.$, and between long. $77^\\circ 10'$ and $77^\\circ 25' E.$ Area, 116 square miles; number of villages, 838; houses, 6318; number of families, 6654. Total population, 31,154, namely, males 17,329, and females 13,825; average density of population, 269 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 30,819; Muhammadans, 307; Sikhs, 18; Christians, 10. The revenue in 1883 was estimated at \u00a36000. Principal products, opium and grain. The present R\u00e1j\u00e1 (1883) is Balb\u00edr Sen, a R\u00e1jput by caste, who succeeded his father Mahendra Sen in 1882. The chief of Keonthal was formerly styled R\u00e1n\u00e1, but was raised by the British Government to the higher rank of R\u00e1j\u00e1 in 1857.\n\nAfter the G\u00farkha war a portion of the territory of Keonthal, which had been occupied by the G\u00farkhas, was sold to the Mah\u00e1-r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Pati\u00e1la. In consideration of this, no tribute is paid by the Keonthal R\u00e1j\u00e1 for the remainder of his State, which was restored to him by sanad in 1815, on the expulsion of the G\u00farkhas from the country. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 holds another sanad, dated September 1815, conferring on the Keonthal chief, and his heirs for ever, paramount authority over the petty States of Theog, Kothi, Ghund, Madhan (or Ki\u00e1ri), and Ratesh, the chiefs of which, with their descendants, are bound to regard the chief of Keonthal as their liege, and to pay an annual tribute as follows:\u2014Kothi, \u00a350; Theog, \u00a350; Ghund, \u00a325; Madhan, \u00a325. A third sanad was granted to Keonthal, conferring P\u00fannar on him and his heirs. It is dated 1823, though the transfer was authorized in 1816. The reasons given for this measure were the isolated position of P\u00fannar, the turbulent character of its inhabitants, the indisposition of Government to extend its territories in the hills, and a desire to confer a benefit on Keonthal. The tribu-\ntaries of Keonthal are:\u2014The R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Koth\u00ed, the late chief of which obtained that rank for services during the Mutiny\u2014area of his estate, 36 square miles; estimated population (1875) 2500; and revenue, \u00a3600. The Th\u00e1kur of TheoG\u2014area of estate, 10 square miles; estimated population (1875) 3000; and revenue, \u00a3330. The Th\u00e1kur of Madhan\u2014area of estate, 13 square miles; estimated population (1875) 1000; and revenue, \u00a3160. The Th\u00e1kur of Ghund\u2014area of estate, 3 square miles; estimated population (1875) 1000; and revenue, \u00a3100. The Th\u00e1kur of Ratesh\u2014area of estate, 3 square miles; estimated population (1875) 437; and revenue, \u00a320. The population of these subordinate States are not shown separately in the Census Report of 1881, but are included within the figures for Keonthal.\n\nKer\u00e1 (Kheda).\u2014Village in Cutch (Kachchh) State, Bombay Presidency; situated 13 miles south of Bh\u00faj. Noted for its old Sivaite temple, dating from perhaps the end of the 10th century, which was thrown down by an earthquake in 1819. The following description is condensed from an account furnished by Mr. James Burgess, Archaeological Surveyor to the Government of Bombay. The shrine is still standing, and measures 8 feet 6 inches square inside, with walls 2 feet 7 inches thick, surrounded by a pradakshina or path 2 feet 6 inches wide\u2014the vimana measuring 24 feet over all. This temple has been built partly of red and partly of yellowish stone, very hard, and standing exposure very well. Of the mandap, which was 18 feet 9 inches wide, only a part of the north wall with one window in it is left; all the rest is a heap of ruins. The sculptures on the walls are not numerous, but are superior to the usual run of such work. The elaborate ornamental work on the faces of the spire has been largely undercut; it represents the outlines of a chaitya window, repeated over a triangular face, with human figures between. Of these triangles of sculpture there are eight on each side, gradually diminishing in size as they rise higher and higher, one behind another, like so many gable ends. The corners of the shrine are surmounted by miniature spires, reaching not quite half the height of this sculpture, and above them are four other similar, but set farther inwards; above these and the sculpture rises the massive outline of the great central spire or sikh\u00e1ra, all beautifully carved. To light the pradakshina, there is a window of perforated stone on each side.\n\nTo the south-east of Ker\u00e1 is a small village on rising ground, above which stands the mausoleum of P\u00edr Ghul\u00e1m Ali. The principal buildings within the enclosure are:\u2014(1) The dargah, facing the east with one large dome, and in front of it three smaller ones. Inside is the tomb, under a canopy, supported by 12 small columns. Against the pall lies a representation of a M\u00faghal p\u00edr, a water-colour portrait of Ali, with a nimbus round his head, and below him Hassan and Husain, also with\naureoles; and in a third frame, Muhammad in a blue chog\u00e1, but the face left blank,\u2014a curious compromise between the prohibition in the Kur\u00e1n and the desire for a palpable representation of the objects of reverence. (2) A canopy or chhatra stands in the middle of the quadrangle in front of the dargah, with a flat roof and balconies on each side. (3) D\u00e1di Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h\u2019s dargah, with lantern minarets; a neat plain building, with three doors in front and two in the east end. The roof is supported by two arches, the whole width of the building. It contains no tomb, the body having been buried in Iran. These buildings were erected about eighty years ago, Ghul\u00e1m Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h having died at Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed (Kurrachee) in 1796. The estate attached to the establishment is said to yield between \u00a31800 and \u00a31900 per annum, which is expended in charity. Near the village is a large and strong fort. A considerable trade in cloth and ironware is carried on.\n\n**Ker\u00e1la** (or **Chera**).\u2014Ancient kingdom of Southern India, one of the divisions of the Dravida country.\u2014See Chera.\n\n**Kerowlee** (**Karauli**).\u2014Native State in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na.\u2014See Karauli.\n\n**Ker\u00far.**\u2014Town in the B\u00e1d\u00e1mi Sub-division, Bij\u00e1pur District, Bombay Presidency; 14 miles south by east of Kal\u00e1dgi, and 11 miles north-west of B\u00e1d\u00e1mi. Lat. 16\u00b0 1' N., long. 75\u00b0 36' E. Population (1872) 7096; (1881) 3833. A fortified town, on the Shol\u00e1pur-Hubli road. The fort is on a gentle slope about 300 yards south-west of the town. As the town increased, a new market was built to the east of the fort, and a colony of weavers established themselves in the southern market, where they carry on a flourishing trade. The town and fort contain several temples.\n\n**Kesabpur.**\u2014Town in Jess\u00f3r District, Bengal; situated on the Harih\u00e1r river about 18 miles south of Jess\u00f3r town. Lat. 22\u00b0 54' 45\" N., long. 89\u00b0 15' 40\" E. The town is the second largest entrep\u00f4t of commerce in the District, and a centre of the sugar trade. It contains numerous k\u00e1rkh\u00e1n\u00e1s or refineries, conducted by Calcutta native merchants. Sr\u00edpur, a suburb on the other side of the river, almost entirely consists of sugar-refineries. The town has an import trade in rice; and manufactures large quantities of earthen pots and vessels for the purpose of sugar manufacture. Another local manufacture is brasswork. Population (1881) 6405, namely, Hindus, 3236; Muhammadans, 3168; \u2018others,\u2019 1. Area of town site, 640 acres. Municipal income (1882\u201383), \u00a373, 10s. Two large b\u00e1z\u00e1rs or marketplaces.\n\n**Kesaria.**\u2014Petty State in the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. Area, 3 square miles. Population (1872) 186; (1881) 231. Consists of 1 village, with 2 separate proprietors. The revenue in 1882 was estimated at \u00a3165; tribute of \u00a327, 16s. is paid to the\nBritish Government. Three miles north of Lakhtar station on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway.\n\n**Kesariya.**\u2014Village and head-quarters of a police circle (th\u00e1n\u00e1), Champ\u00e1ran District, Bengal. Population (1881) 5256, namely, Hindus, 4753; and Muhammadans, 503. Two miles south of the village, on the road to Sattar gh\u00e1t, stands a lofty brick mound 1400 feet in circumference at its base, capped by a solid brick tower, 62 feet high. The date of this tower (a memorial of Buddhism) is assigned by General Cunningham to between 200 and 500 A.D. The common people call it R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ben ka deora, after a traditional monarch who is said to have been one of five Supreme Emperors of India. A tank a little to the south is also called after this king.\n\n**Kesl\u00e1bori.**\u2014Ancient village in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; beneath the Chim\u00far Hills, 10 miles north-north-east of Seg\u00e1on. Lat. 20\u00b0 25' N., long. 79\u00b0 17' 30\" E. Once a large town, but now reduced to a few huts, with a population in 1881 of only 103 souls. It has a considerable area under rice, irrigated by a hill spring, the water of which proves injurious when drunk by strangers. Near the village is the R\u00e1mdighi pool, a basin about 40 feet in diameter and of unknown depth, hollowed out of the rock, into which falls, during the rains, a stream of some size from a precipice above. According to tradition, R\u00e1ma formed the pool; and an ancient temple still overhangs it, in which are two good carvings of a warrior with shield and straight sword.\n\n**Kesod.**\u2014Town in the Sorath division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. Population (1872) 3169; (1881) 2589, chiefly Loh\u00e1\u00f1as; the decrease is due to the famine of 1878\u201379. A walled town with an inner citadel, 25 miles south-west of Jun\u00e1garh. Has a thriving trade. Known in Persian histories as Kesoj.\n\n**Keti.**\u2014Port, town, and municipality in the Jerruck Sub-division, Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Population (1881) 2141. Situated in lat. 24\u00b0 8' 30\" N., long. 67\u00b0 28' 30\" E., close to the sea, on the Haj\u00e1mro branch of the Indus. Chief port in the Indus delta for river and sea-going boats. Has taken the place of Ghor\u00e1b\u00e1ri, a little farther inland on the same branch, which was the principal commercial town of the surrounding tract in 1845. Ghor\u00e1b\u00e1ri, or Bandar Vikar, was founded about 1826, and ten years later contained 1000 inhabitants. In 1836, M\u00edr Nas\u00edr Kh\u00e1n, brother of the reigning M\u00edr at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, owned Ghor\u00e1b\u00e1ri, and drew from it an annual revenue of over \u00a310,000, the customs of the port alone having been farmed out for \u00a35200; while 180 vessels frequented the harbour every year. In 1837, the exports (rice, gh\u00ed, grindstones) were valued at \u00a326,500, and the imports (English cloth, raw cotton, metals, dates, slaves) at \u00a310,050. In those days no route presented such\nfacilities for the transport of goods to the Upper Delta as the Haj\u00e1mro branch. In 1848, however, the Haj\u00e1mro capriciously receded, and Ghor\u00e1b\u00e1ri immediately dwindled into comparative insignificance. The trade of the deserted port then betook itself to the first Keti, nearer the sea; but about 1853 the place was swept away by a flood, and a new site was chosen in the neighbourhood. This second Keti, the existing town and harbour, now about thirty years old, soon attracted the river trade, and at present ranks next to Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed among the ports of Sind.\n\nDuring the inundation season, nothing is done in the way of trade, and the town has a deserted look; about November the port is open for sea-going vessels. Exports, to the Bombay and Madras Presidencies, to Sonmi\u00e1ni, and Makr\u00e1n, comprise grain, pulses, oil-seeds, wool, cotton, drugs, dyes, saltpetre, and firewood. Imports, from the same places and the Persian Gulf, include cocoa-nuts, cotton piece-goods, metals, sugar, spices, coir, and shells.\n\nThe following statement shows the value of the sea-borne trade of Keti in 1873-74:\u2014To and from ports within Sind\u2014exports, \u00a3164,135; imports, \u00a319,424: to and from ports beyond Sind\u2014exports, \u00a3116,188; imports, \u00a337,629. The gross amount of customs duties collected during the same year was \u00a33070, being import duties, \u00a348, and export duties, \u00a33022. During the prevalence of the south-west monsoon, trade remains at a standstill, vessels being unable to make the harbour from seaward. In the brisk season, from 70 to 90 boats of various sizes may be seen lining the bandar. Sea-borne goods for transit up the Indus must be transferred to river boats. The total number of ships which entered the port from all quarters in 1873-74 was 1295, with a gross tonnage of 41,073 tons; the total number clearing for all ports was 1323, with a gross tonnage of 41,991 tons. The average annual value of the imports for the five years ending 1882-83 was \u00a330,338, and the exports \u00a366,723. The value of the imports in 1882-83 was \u00a325,426, and exports \u00a360,301. The average number of vessels for the five years ending in 1882-83 that entered the port was 266, with a gross tonnage of 6277 tons; and that cleared, 764, with 20,698 tons. The number of vessels that entered the port in 1882-83 was 321, tonnage 7967; that cleared, 900, tonnage 23,567.\n\nThe river trade of Keti, though considerable, is fluctuating. The following statement gives particulars for 1873-74:\u2014Value of down-river trade, \u00a3274,268; value of up-river trade, \u00a346,692; entered, down-river boats, 2915, with a burden of 1,241,155 maunds; cleared, up-river boats, 2862, with a burden of 1,204,336 maunds. No later statistics are available for the river trade.\n\nThe town has several times been in danger of floods, but, owing to its slightly elevated position, has hitherto escaped the fate of its pre-\ndecessor. Communication by road with Tatta, 60 miles south-west; with M\u00edrpur Sakro, 32 miles south-south-west; and with Ghorab\u00e1ri, 13 miles. Subsidiary jail, custom-house, Government charitable dispensary. A municipality was established in 1854. In 1882-83, the municipal income was \u00a3624; municipal expenditure, \u00a3389; incidence of municipal taxation, 4s. per head.\n\nKeukuchi.\u2014Halting-place in Bashahr State, Punjab, on the northeast slope of the Ch\u00e1rang Pass. Lat. 31\u00b0 27' N., long. 78\u00b0 37' E. According to Thornton, the abundance of fuel and herbage causes this spot to be selected as a camping-ground. The Nangalti, a rapid unfordable torrent, flows down the pass, and falls into the Tidang a few miles below Keukuchi. Elevation above sea-level, 12,457 feet.\n\nKeunjhar.\u2014Native State of Orissa, lying between lat. 21\u00b0 1' and 22\u00b0 9' 30\" N., and between long. 85\u00b0 14' and 86\u00b0 24' 35\" E. Bounded on the north by Singbh\u00fam District; on the east by Morbhanj State and Balasor District; on the south by Cuttack District and Dhenk\u00e1nal State; and on the west by Dhenk\u00e1nal, Pal Lah\u00e1ra, and Bon\u00e1i States. Keunjhar is divided into two wild tracts\u2014Lower Keunjhar, including the valleys, and Upper Keunjhar, embracing the mountainous highlands. The latter consist of great clusters of rugged crags, which afford almost inaccessible retreats to their inhabitants; and which, although from the plains they appear to be sharply ridged or peaked, have extensive table-lands on their summits, equally fit for pasture and for tillage. The Baitarani river takes its rise in the hilly northwestern division. Principal peaks\u2014Th\u00e1kw\u00e1ni, 3003 feet; Gandh\u00e1-Mad\u00e1n, 3479 feet; Tom\u00e1k, 2577 feet; and Bolat, 1818 feet.\n\nKeunjhar is the second largest of the Orissa States, with an area of 3096 square miles. The Census of 1872 thus returned the population, according to religion\u2014Hindus, 113,207, or 62.2 per cent.; Muhammadans, 487, or 0.3 per cent.; Christian, 1; 'others,' consisting of aboriginal tribes who still retain their primitive forms of faith, 68,176, or 37.5 per cent.; total, 181,871, namely, males 90,879, and females 90,992. Classified according to race, there were, in 1872\u2014aboriginal tribes, 44,438, or 24.3 per cent., principally composed of Kols (10,990), Gonds (10,407), S\u00e1onts (7172), and Savars (5125); semi-Hinduized aborigines, 49,294, or 27.2 per cent., mainly composed of P\u00e1ns (19,827), Bhuiy\u00e1s (18,481), and Bathudis (7898); Hindu castes, 87,651, or 48.2 per cent., the most numerous castes being Khand\u00e1its (22,225), Br\u00e1hmans (8583), and Gaurs (6743); Muhammadans, 487, or 0.3 per cent.\n\nIn 1881, a different system of classification was adopted by the Census officers, and no ethnological division seems to have been made. The total population had increased to 215,612, namely, males 109,041, and females 106,571; average density, 69.7 persons per\nsquare mile; number of villages, 1638; number of occupied houses, 38,212. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 195,695; Muhammadans, 447; Sikhs, 7; aboriginal tribes still outside the pale of Hinduism, 19,408; 'others,' 55. The principal village and residence of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 is Keunjhar, situated on the Midnapur and Sambalpur road, lat. 21\u00b0 37' 25\" N., long. 85\u00b0 37' 31\" E.\n\nKeunjhar State originally formed part of Morbhanj; but about 200 years ago, the tribes of this part finding it a great hardship to travel through the perilous forests of Morbhanj to obtain justice from their prince, separated themselves, and set up the brother of the Morbhanj R\u00e1j\u00e1 as their independent ruler. Since then 27 chiefs have ruled. The last prince rendered good service during the Kol rebellion in 1857, and was rewarded by Government with the title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1. He died in 1861, without legitimate issue. On Government nominating his natural son, the present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, to the throne, a dispute arose as to the succession, which ultimately culminated in an insurrection of the Bhuiy\u00e1 and Juang tribes in favour of an alleged adopted son, which called for the intervention of British troops before it was suppressed. Estimated annual revenue of the State, \u00a36339; tribute, \u00a3197. The chief's militia consists of a force of 1758 men and 318 village police. A Government elephant (kh\u00e9d\u00e1) establishment was formerly maintained at Keunjhar under the superintendence of an English officer, and a large number of valuable animals were captured; but the establishment has since been abolished. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 maintains 49 schools in the State, attended in 1881 by 962 pupils. A number of other unaided schools exist. Metalled roads have been made in the neighbourhood of the capital village, and a postal establishment is maintained. Keunjhar, besides being one of the most important, is at the same time one of the best, if not the best, administered of the Orissa States.\n\n**Keunth\u00e1l.**\u2014One of the Punjab Hill States.\u2014See **Keonthal**.\n\n**Kew\u00e1n\u00ed.**\u2014River of Kheri District, Oudh; takes its rise in the Jum\u00e1\u00edta t\u00e1l, near the village of Jum\u00e1\u00edta, 4 miles south-west of Kheri town; flows a tortuous south-south-east course, and falls into the Chauk\u00e1, at a distance of 40 miles from its source, as the crow flies. Near its source it is a narrow and shallow stream, but it deepens as it nears the Chauk\u00e1. Non-navigable, and fordable everywhere, except during the rains. It has a breadth of about 50 feet, and an average depth of 9 feet during the rainy season. The large villages of Sanda and Nabinagar are situated on its banks.\n\n**Kh\u00e1b.**\u2014Village in Bashahr State, Punjab; lies on the left bank of the Sutlej (Satlaj), which flows between high cliffs of slate and granite. Lat. 31\u00b0 48' N., long. 78\u00b0 41' E. Thornton states that Kh\u00e1b is the highest point where the grape ripens in Kun\u00e1w\u00e1r, and that fields, vine-\nyards, and apricot trees surround the village, which is noted for the excellence of its fruit. Elevation above sea-level, 9310 feet.\n\nKh\u00e1b\u00fal.\u2014Village in Bashahr State, Punjab; situated 1 mile from the right bank of the P\u00e1bar river, on the route from Sub\u00e1thu to the Barenda Pass. Lat. 31\u00b0 15' N., long. 77\u00b0 58' E. The surrounding country is well tilled, irrigated by the mountain streams, and wooded with sycamores, chestnuts, and apricots. Elevation above sea-level, 8400 feet.\n\nKhadki.\u2014Town in Poona District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See KIRKI.\n\nKh\u00e1g\u00e1.\u2014North-eastern tahs\u00edl of Fatehpur District, North-Western Provinces; lying along the south bank of the Ganges, and traversed by the East Indian Railway. Area, 274 square miles, of which 129\u00b75 square miles are cultivated, 57\u00b79 square miles cultivable, and 86\u00b78 square miles barren waste. Population (1881) 136,947, namely, males 68,712, and females 68,235; average density of population, 500 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 115,642; Muhammadans, 21,304; 'others,' 1. Number of villages, 335, of which 257 contained less than five hundred inhabitants. Land revenue, \u00a319,925; total Government revenue, \u00a323,433, including local rates and cesses; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a336,856. The tahs\u00edl, which comprises the two pargan\u00e1s of Hathg\u00e1on and Hotila, contained in 1884, 9 civil and criminal courts; number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 3; strength of regular police, 180 men; chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs, or village police, 463.\n\nKh\u00e1g\u00e1.\u2014Town in pargan\u00e1 Hathg\u00e1on, Fatehpur District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Kh\u00e1g\u00e1 tahs\u00edl, situated on the Grand Trunk Road, about 20 miles from Fatehpur town; lat. 25\u00b0 46' 28\" N., long. 81\u00b0 8' 46\" E. Population (1881) 1643, the prevailing caste being Cham\u00e1rs. Police station, post-office, good market, station on the East Indian Railway. A religious fair is held here in the month of October.\n\nKh\u00e1g\u00e1n.\u2014Mountain valley in Haz\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Punjab.\u2014See KAGAN.\n\nKhagaul.\u2014Town and municipality in Patn\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated a short distance south of Din\u00e1pur. Lat. 25\u00b0 34' 30\" N., long. 85\u00b0 5' E. The population, which in 1872 numbered only 5257, had increased by 1881 to 14,075, namely, males 6584, and females 7491. Classified according to religion, the population consisted of\u2014Hindus, 11,771; Muhammadans, 1997; 'others,' 307. Municipal income (1881), \u00a3175; (1882-83), \u00a3322; average incidence of taxation, 4\u00bdd. per head of population. The Din\u00e1pur railway station is just outside the town; which, indeed, has only sprung into importance since the opening of the railway.\n\nKhaghori\u00e1.\u2014Village in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, Bengal;\nsituated on the My\u00e1ni tributary of the K\u00e1s\u00e1lang river. In 1872\u201373, a small colony of G\u00farkhas from the borders of Nep\u00e1l was established here, with the object of getting the jungle cleared through their means. A sum of \u00a310 was advanced to each family by the Deputy Commissioner, to enable the immigrants to purchase cattle and ploughs, and for their subsistence until they could raise a crop. The settlers, however, were unable to endure the deadly climate of the place; and in the following year they were removed to another settlement of their countrymen at R\u00e1ng\u00e1m\u00e1ti, a healthier locality farther south, with whom they amalgamated and formed one colony. The settlers, however, proved unfit for colonization, and the little community was finally broken up in 1877.\n\nKhagrapar\u00e1.\u2014Village in the north of Darrang District, Assam; lying near the foot of the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Hills. An annual fair is held here, which is largely attended by people from considerable distances. In 1881\u201382, the Bhuti\u00e1s are estimated to have sold goods to the value of \u00a33656, chiefly salt, blankets, ponies, gold, and a spice resembling coriander, called jabrang, in exchange for which they purchased rice, silk and cotton cloth, dried fish, and hardware.\n\nKh\u00e1\u00edbar (Khyber).\u2014A celebrated pass leading from Pesh\u00e1war District of the Punjab into Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n; centre of pass, lat. 34\u00b0 6' N., long. 71\u00b0 5' E. The name is also applied to the range of hills in Y\u00e1gh\u00edst\u00e1n, through which the pass runs. The Kh\u00e1\u00edbar mountains form, indeed, the last spurs of the Sufed Koh, as that mighty range sinks down into the valley of the K\u00e1b\u00fal river. The elevation of the connecting ridge is 3400 feet; but it rises to 6800 feet in the T\u00e1tara peak. On either side of the ridge which connects the Kh\u00e1\u00edbar mountains with the Sufed Koh rise two small streams\u2014the one flowing north-west to the K\u00e1b\u00fal river, the other south-south-east towards Jamr\u00fad. The beds of these streams form the Kh\u00e1\u00edbar defile. On the north of this defile is the Kh\u00e1\u00edbar range; on its south is another range, which divides the defile from the B\u00e1r\u00e1 valley, and which is also a spur of the Sufed Koh. These two ranges respectively throw out their spurs south and north like two combs placed with their teeth inwards, the teeth being prevented from quite meeting by the streams above mentioned.\n\nThe Kh\u00e1\u00edbar Pass forms the great northern military route from Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n into India; as the Kuram and Gumal Passes form the intermediate military and trade routes, and the Bolan Pass the great southern passage both for war and commerce. The Kh\u00e1\u00edbar Pass commences near Jamr\u00fad, to the west of Pesh\u00e1war, and twists through the hills for about 33 miles in a north-westerly direction, till it debouches at Dh\u00e1ka. The plains of Pesh\u00e1war District stretch rom its eastern mouth; those of Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d from its western exit.\nBeyond its eastern end is the remarkable collection of caves at Kadam; and beyond its western are many interesting remains of Buddhism and of ancient civilisation. The pass lies along the bed of a torrent, chiefly through slate rocks, and is subject to sudden floods. Burnes' camp had a narrow escape below the fort of Al\u00ed Masjid. The dangerous months for floods are July, August, December, and January. The gradient is generally easy, except at the Land\u00ed Kh\u00e1na Pass, but is covered with loose stones, which become larger as the head of the stream is reached. The following details are condensed from General MacGregor's official account.\n\nImmediately on leaving Jamrud, the defensible ground may be said to commence, as the spurs come almost up to that place in round bare knolls of low height, but very sufficient command of the road. Kadam, however, 3 miles from Jamrud, is generally considered to be the actual eastern entrance. At this point the hills begin to close in, and 1000 yards farther the width of the pass is 450 feet; the bed is easy, level, and covered with small shingle,\u2014the hills on the left are very steep; 500 yards farther on, this width gradually lessens to 370 feet, the hills on either side being sheer precipices. At 1200 yards farther the width is 190 feet, the hills being steep for 50 or 60 feet in height, then sloping back; 850 yards farther the width is 240 feet, the hills on the right being precipitous, and on the left rounded and practicable; at 1050 yards farther the width is 280 feet, the hills being very steep on both sides; 850 yards farther the width is 210 feet, the hills on the right being perpendicular, and on the left not so steep; 1050 yards farther the width is 70 feet, the hills being very precipitous on both sides; 500 yards farther the width is 230 feet, the hills on the left being precipitous, and on the right rounded and practicable; 2 miles farther the width is 250 feet, the hills on the right being perpendicular, and on the left practicable; 1050 yards farther the width is 65 feet, the hills on both sides being very steep, those on the left perpendicular; 1050 yards farther the width is 110 feet, the hills on both sides being comparatively easy and practicable; 880 yards farther the width is 210 feet, the hills on the left being steep, and on the right open and easy; 2 miles 220 yards farther the width is 200 feet, the hills on the left being steepish, and on the right open and comparatively easy.\n\nAt Al\u00ed Masjid, 1300 yards farther, the width is 40 feet, the hills being perpendicular and impracticable. Between Kadam and this point, Moorcroft says, the mountains on either hand are about 1300 feet high, slaty, and to all appearance inaccessible; 1450 yards farther the width is 270 feet, hills on the left precipitous, on right comparatively easy; 1 mile 1000 yards farther the width is 390 feet, the hills being very steep; 6\u00bd miles beyond this lies the L\u00e1l\u00e1beg valley, which averages 1\u00bd mile\nbroad; 880 yards farther the width is 10 feet or less, the hills being quite perpendicular; in 1600 yards farther the road goes over the Landi Khana Pass, the width being 140 feet, and the hills being very steep, especially on the left; 3\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) miles farther the width is 300 feet, the hills being steep on the left, but not so precipitous on the right; 2\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) miles farther the width is 200 feet, the hills being very steep on both sides; 3 miles farther is Dhaka, where the defile opens. The total length of the defile, therefore, from Jamrud to Dhaka is about 33 miles.\n\nThe elevation in feet of various points of the pass is\u2014Jamrud, 1670; Ali Masjid, 2433; Landi Khana, 2488; Landi Kotal, 3373; Dhaka, 1404. If the elevation of Jamrud (2433) given by Mr. Scott of the Survey is right, all these figures would be increased by 763 feet. The ascent over the Landi Khana Pass is narrow, rugged, steep, and generally the most difficult part of the whole road. Guns could not be drawn here except by men, and then only after the improvement of the road; the descent is along a well-made road, and is not so difficult. Just beyond Ali Masjid the road passes over a bed of projecting and slippery rock, which makes this portion extremely difficult for laden animals. The Khaiibar can be turned by the Tatara road, which enters the hills about 9 miles north of Jamrud (another branch entering 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) miles nearer), and either joins the Khaiibar road at Luadgai, or keeps the north of the range and goes to Dhaka.\n\nDuring the first Afghan war, the Khaiibar was the scene of many skirmishes with the Afridis, and of some disasters to our troops. Colonel Wade, with from 10,000 to 11,000 of all arms, including the Sikh contingent, moved from Jamrud on the 22nd July 1839 to Gagri; here he halted a day and entrenched his position; on the 24th July, he again marched to Lala China; on the 15th, he moved to the attack of Ali Masjid, sending one column of 600 men and 2 guns, under Lieutenant Mackeson, to the right; and 11 companies of infantry, 1 6-pounder gun, and 1 howitzer to the left; while below a column was placed to watch the mouth of Shadi Bagadi gorge. Both columns drove the enemy before them, the right meeting with some opposition, and the left getting into a position to shell the fort. On the 26th all the enemy's outposts were driven in, and on the 27th they evacuated the fort. The enemy had 509 Jazailchis, or musket men, and were supported by several hundred Khaiibaris. The British loss was 22 killed and 158 wounded. After this there was no further opposition.\n\nA strong post was left in Ali Masjid, and a detachment near Lala China, to maintain communication with Peshawar, and a post of irregulars under Lieutenant Mackeson was placed near Dhaka. The post near Lala China was attacked during the operations. It was garrisoned by Yusafzai auxiliaries, whose numbers had been thinned, and the\nsurvivors were worn down by continued sickness, when the Kh\u00e1ibar\u00eds, estimated at 6000 strong, attacked their breastwork. They were long kept at bay, but the marauders were animated by the love of plunder, and persevered in their attacks. They were aware that the devoted garrison had recently received their arrears of pay, and that a sum of Rs. 12,000 was buried on the spot, which was an old Kh\u00e1ibar\u00ed haunt. Finally, they carried the weak field-work, and mercilessly put to the sword 400 of its defenders. They did not keep possession of it, but, after repeating their vain attempts on Al\u00ed Masjid and Captain Ferris' posts in the valley, retired to their mountains.\n\nWhen Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d was blockaded, it was proposed to send a force through the Kh\u00e1ibar to its relief, and as a preliminary measure, Lieutenant-Colonel Moseley was detached to occupy Al\u00ed Masjid with two regiments of Native Infantry. He marched on the night of the 15th January 1842, and reached the place with little opposition the next morning. Through some mismanagement, however, only a portion of the provisions requisite for the two regiments accompanied them. It became necessary, therefore, to forward the residue without delay; and to this end, and with the purpose of afterwards moving upon Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, Brigadier Wilde advanced from Jamr\u00fad with the remaining two regiments (the 60th and 30 Native Infantry) and 4 Sikh guns. But the appearance of Colonel Moseley's detachment had alarmed the Afr\u00edd\u00eds, who now rose, and, closing the pass, prepared to resist Brigadier Wilde's entrance. The Brigadier, nevertheless, pushed onwards on the 19th January, and encountered the enemy at the mouth of the pass; but, owing to the uselessness of the Sikh guns, and the inadequacy of his force with so powerful a body of the enemy advantageously placed in his front, his attempt to reach Ali Masjid totally failed. The situation of Lieutenant-Colonel Moseley, shut up as he was in Al\u00ed Masjid, with scarcely any provisions, now became desperate. He was not long, however, in deciding upon the course which it became him to take under circumstances of so serious a nature. He cut his way back to Jamr\u00fad; his reasons for doing so being, that he found that the remnant of his stores only amounted to 6 maunds of atta for the subsistence of 2500 men, who had already been five or six days on half-rations, and who had been exposed for eight days, without tents, to an inclement climate.\n\nThe next occasion on which the Kh\u00e1ibar Pass was used as a great military road was when General Pollock advanced on the 6th April 1842. On his return to India, the British army marched through the Kh\u00e1ibar in three divisions. The first, under General Pollock, passed through with no loss. The second, under General M'Caskill, was not equally fortunate; one brigade being overtaken by night, left two mountain-train guns with the rear-guard, which was suddenly attacked,\nand the guns taken, though they were recovered next day. The rear-guard of General Nott's force was also attacked on the 5th and 6th November between Land\u00ed Kh\u00e1na and L\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1gh, and again on leaving Al\u00ed Masjid.\n\nIt was at Al\u00ed Masjid in the Kh\u00e1ibar that Sir Neville Chamberlain's friendly mission to the Am\u00edr Sher Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n was stopped and repelled with threats. This was in 1878, when Lord Lytton, the Viceroy of India, had determined to make a final attempt to establish British influence in Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n. On the repulse of General Sir Neville Chamberlain's mission, an ultimatum was handed to the Am\u00edr's general, F\u00e1iz Muhammad, in Al\u00ed Masjid; and the day specified having passed without the return of an answer, Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n was invaded by three British columns, one of which started from Jamr\u00fad at the mouth of the Kh\u00e1ibar. The other columns started from Thal and Quetta. On the second day of the campaign the fortress of Al\u00ed Masjid, 9\u00bd miles from Jamr\u00fad, was brilliantly captured by the British troops, under Sir Samuel Browne. The successful passage of the Kh\u00e1ibar by Sir Samuel Browne's force, and the unopposed occupation, first of Dh\u00e1ka at the eastern mouth of the pass, and then of Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d in the plains beyond, were immediately subsequent events. The treaty which closed the war in May 1879 left the Kh\u00e1ibar tribes for the future under British control.\n\nKhair.\u2014Western tahsil of Al\u00edgarh District, North-Western Provinces; stretching inland from the east bank of the Jumna, and irrigated by distributaries from the Ganges Canal. It comprises the three pargan\u00e1s of Khair, Chandausi, and Tappal. Area, 406 square miles, of which 293 were cultivated at the time of the last land settlement in 1874, the proportion of cultivated to cultivable land being 84 per cent. Population (1872) 169,459; (1882) 160,264, showing a decrease of 9195 in nine years. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 147,247; Muhammadans, 12,894; Jains, 120; 'others,' 3. Number of villages, 276, of which 171 had less than five hundred inhabitants. Land revenue, \u00a340,105; total Government revenue, \u00a344,115; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a362,131. The tahsil contains 1 criminal, but no civil court; with 4 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); a regular police force of 64, and a village watch or rural police of 354 men.\n\nKhair.\u2014Town in Al\u00edgarh District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Khair tahsil. Situated on the road to the Jumna; distant from Al\u00edgarh town 14 miles north-west. Tahsili, police station, post-office, school, munsifi. Population (1881) 4455. For police and conservancy purposes, a small house-tax is levied. Local revenue in 1873, \u00a396. During the Mutiny of 1857, the Chauh\u00e1ns occupied Khair, under R\u00e1o Bh\u00fap\u00e1l Singh, who set himself up as R\u00e1j\u00e1. On the 1st of June, an expedition of the Agra volunteers, under Mr. Watson,\nsurrounded the town, and captured the rebel leader, who was hanged by order of a court-martial. Later in the month, the Chauh\u00e1ns called in the J\u00e1ts, attacked the town, and plundered or destroyed the Government buildings and the houses of the wealthy Mah\u00e1jans and Baniy\u00e1s.\n\nKhair\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in S\u00edt\u00e1pur tahsil, S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh. Bounded on the north by Harg\u00e1m pargan\u00e1; on the east by the Gon river; and on the south and west by the Sar\u00e1yan river, the two streams meeting at the southern extremity of the pargan\u00e1, which forms their do\u00e1b. Originally in the possession of the P\u00e1s\u00eds, who were ousted by the Bais and K\u00e1yasths; but their descendants still hold many villages. Constituted a pargan\u00e1 by Todar Mall, in the reign of Akbar. Soil fertile; country well wooded and watered; the Gon and the Sar\u00e1yan afford water communication, except during the dry months. Area, 128 square miles, or 81,919 acres (excluding S\u00edt\u00e1pur cantonment); of which 71 square miles, or 45,708 acres, are cultivated, and 30 square miles, or 20,628 acres, are cultivable. Incidence of Government land revenue, 3s. 1\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area, 2s. 2\u00bdd. per acre of assessed area, and 1s. 8\u00bdd. per acre of total area. Rents are paid almost entirely in kind. Population (1869) 63,728; (1882) 57,411, namely, males 29,348, and females 28,063. The town of Khair\u00e1b\u00e1d and the cantonment of S\u00edtapur are situated in this pargan\u00e1. Large markets are held in three other villages. Six numerously attended Hindu fairs and three Musalm\u00e1n festivals are held, at all of which a brisk trade is carried on. Three military camping stations, at Sar\u00e1yan on the Bisw\u00e1n road, at Thompsonganj, and at Jal\u00e1lpur on the Lucknow road.\n\nKhair\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Chief town of S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh; situated 5 miles south-east of S\u00edt\u00e1pur, the civil station and cantonment of the District, in lat. 27\u00b0 31' 30\" N., and long. 80\u00b0 47' 35\" E. The town is said to have been founded by one Khaira, a P\u00e1s\u00ed, in the first year of the 11th century, and to have been subsequently taken possession of by a K\u00e1yasth family. In after years, many rent-free grants of portions of its site were made to Musalm\u00e1ns, who came in great numbers in the reigns of B\u00e1bar and Akbar, but these grants were all resumed by the Naw\u00e1b of Oudh about 1810. Khair\u00e1b\u00e1d is the seventh largest town in Oudh. It contained a population in 1869 of 15,677 persons, but had decreased by 1881 to 14,217. Classified according to religion, the population in the latter year consisted of\u2014Muhammadans, 7653; Hindus, 6551; Jains, 9; and Christians, 4. Municipal income in 1876\u201377, \u00a3401; in 1882\u201383, \u00a3471, of which \u00a3397 was derived from octroi; average rate of taxation, 6\u00bdd. per head. The town contains 40 mosques and 30 Hindu temples, besides a handsome set of holy Muhammadan buildings, erected about fifty years ago.\nThese consist of a Kadam R\u00e1sul ('prophet's footprint'), an Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, and mosques with intervening courtyards, all surrounded by a wall. The public buildings consist of a police station, school, post-office, sar\u00e1\u00eds, etc. Four b\u00e1z\u00e1rs and markets are held daily. Large fair held in January, lasting ten days, and attended by an average of 60,000 persons. A second fair is held at the Dasah\u00e1ra festival, attended by about 15,000 persons. Annual value of b\u00e1z\u00e1r sales, about \u00a334,000.\n\nKhair\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014River in B\u00e1karganj District, Bengal. An offshoot of the Baris\u00e1l river at R\u00e1n\u00edh\u00e1t, flowing east of B\u00e1karganj town to Angari\u00e1h\u00e1t, a distance of 22 miles; whence it continues as the Nah\u00e1lia river, running a tortuous course, sometimes south-east and sometimes south-west, for 14 miles, as far as Patu\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed; after which it is called the Gul\u00e1chip\u00e1 or Rabn\u00e1b\u00e1d river, and flows a southerly course for 20 miles till it falls into the Bay of Bengal, just north of the Rabn\u00e1b\u00e1d islands. A branch of this river, called in different parts of its course the Patu\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed, Begh\u00e1i, and Buriswar, falls into the sea under the latter name.\n\nKhair\u00e1gahr.\u2014South-western tahsil of Agra District, North-Western Provinces; consisting of a spur of British territory, almost surrounded by the Native States of Bhartpur (Bhurtpore) and Dholpur, and largely intersected by wild ravines. The tahsil is divided by the Utanghan river into two portions, each varying greatly in physical features. The northern tract is of the same character as the neighbouring lands of Fatehpur Sikri and Fateh\u00e1b\u00e1d, having an alluvial soil. In the south-west portion of the tahsil, a range of the Vindhya hills separates it from Bhartpur territory. There are also a number of isolated hills of red sandstone, which is quarried in considerable quantities. Some of the larger hills are wooded, and supply materials for charcoal, as well as scanty grazing for cattle. The Sindhia State Railway passes through the eastern half of the tahsil, which is also intersected by the Agra and Bombay road, as well as by five unmetalled roads which meet at Khair\u00e1gahr village. Area of the tahsil, 308\u00b79 square miles, of which 192\u00b79 square miles are cultivated, 77 square miles cultivable, and the remaining 39 square miles uncultivable waste. Land revenue (1881-82), \u00a328,485; total Government revenue, \u00a331,988; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a351,703. Total population (1881) 118,134, namely, males 64,155, and females 53,979, giving an average density of 382 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Hindus, 110,291; Muhammadans, 7051; Jains, 784; Christians, 6; and 'others,' 2. Total number of villages, 156, of which 82 contained less than five hundred, and none upwards of five thousand inhabitants. The tahsil contains 1 criminal court, with 5 police stations; strength of regular police, 69 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 407.\nKhair\u00e1garh.\u2014Village in Agra District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Khair\u00e1garh tahsil; situated 18 miles south-west of Agra city, on the left or north bank of the Utanghan river, in lat. $27^\\circ 1' 28''$ N., and long. $77^\\circ 53' 50''$ E. Population (1881) 1261. Besides being the head-quarters of the tahsil, the village has a first-class police station, imperial post-office, and Anglo-veracular school.\n\nKhair\u00e1garh.\u2014Native State attached to R\u00e1ipur District, Central Provinces, and the most important of the Chhat\u00edsgarh Feudatory States, lying in the richest part of the Chhat\u00edsgarh plain. Area, 940 square miles; number of towns and villages, 512; houses, 30,392. Population (1881) 166,138, namely, males 82,677, and females 83,461; average density, 177 persons per square mile.\n\nThe ruling family, which is R\u00e1j-Gond, and descended from the royal family of Garh\u00e1 Mandl\u00e1, originally held only the small forest tract known as Kholw\u00e1, below the S\u00e1letekri range; but they obtained extensive grants in 1818, both from the Mandl\u00e1 princes and from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rulers of N\u00e1gpur. The last chief, L\u00e1l Fateh Singh, was deposed, and died in 1874. From 1874 till February 1883, the State was under direct British management, when it was made over to its present chief, L\u00e1l Umras Singh, in public darb\u00e1r. During the year 1876-77, the income amounted to \u00a312,259, of which \u00a311,261 was derived from land revenue, according to a summary settlement concluded in 1874; the expenditure amounted to \u00a39433, of which \u00a33149 was devoted to the chief's family. In 1882-83, the State revenue was \u00a313,963. The tribute payable to the British Government is fixed at \u00a34700.\n\nCotton, wheat, and gram constitute the chief products; iron-ore is also found in parts. Two of the principal passes through the S\u00e1letekr\u00ed hills between Chhat\u00edsgarh and N\u00e1gpur lie in Khair\u00e1garh; but a different line has been adopted for the Great Eastern Road. All the roads leading to the great grain mart of Dongargarh, one of the principal stations on the N\u00e1gpur-Chhat\u00edsgarh railway, can at small cost be made good cold-weather routes. A fair-weather road from Dongargarh to Borla in Bil\u00e1sipur District, passing through Khair\u00e1garh, Chhuikh\u00e1dan, and Kawardh\u00e1 States, is (1883) about to be constructed. Dispensaries have been opened at Khair\u00e1garh and Dongargarh, and various public buildings, court-houses, jail, etc., have recently been built.\n\nKhair\u00e1garh.\u2014Chief town of Khair\u00e1garh Feudatory State, attached to R\u00e1ipur District, Central Provinces; situated 45 miles north-west of R\u00e1ipur town, at the junction of the Am and the Pip\u00e1ria rivers, in lat. $21^\\circ 25' 30''$ N., long. $81^\\circ 2' E$. Population (1881) 2887, namely, Hindus, 2600; Muhammadans, 176; Kab\u00edranth\u00eds, 78; Satn\u00e1m\u00eds, 2; Jains, 4; aboriginal religions, 27.\nKhairi.\u2014Small estate in Bhand\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; 8 miles north of S\u00e1koli, on the Great Eastern Road, comprising 4 villages, on an area of 14 square miles, of which 2 square miles are cultivated. The forests yield abundance of inferior timber. The chief is a M\u00e1n\u00e1, and the population (633 in 1881) chiefly Gonds.\n\nKhairigarh.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Nigh\u00e1san tahsil, Kheri District, Oudh; situated between the Mohan and Sarju rivers, which border it on the north and south; bounded on the east by the Kaur\u00ed\u00e1la river, and on the west by Nep\u00e1l State. The largest pargan\u00e1 in the District, being 47 miles from east to west and 12 from north to south. Area, 425 square miles, of which 263 miles are covered with State forests. Population (1869) 33,046; (1881) 39,444, namely, males 21,378, and females 18,066. Hindus numbered 34,903, and Muhammadans, 4541. Ah\u00edrs form the principal Hindu caste. Br\u00e1hmans are very few in number. Crops, principally rice and barley. The only landed proprietor in the pargan\u00e1 is the R\u00e1ja of Khairigarh, who owns 67 out of the 70 villages, the remaining 3 being the property of Government. The Government land revenue, which about 1875 was returned at \u00a34963, had fallen by 1882\u201383 to \u00a32343. The pargan\u00e1 is said to derive its name from the khair jungle, found here in great quantities.\n\nThe early history of the pargan\u00e1 is lost in obscurity. It has been for many centuries the huge forest which it now appears. In the reign of Firoz-ud-d\u00edn Tughlak, 1351\u20131388 A.D., it is related that the Emperor established a chain of forts along the north bank of the river Sarju, to repel marauding expeditions on the part of the mountaineers of Dhoti and Garhw\u00e1l. Tradition states that the Emperor, with his son, ascended the tallest tower of the great Khairigarh fort. He cast his eyes over the boundless sea of jungle, in which no house roof, no temple spire, no smoke, nor any other sign of human habitation appeared, and was so appalled by the vast solitude, that he for ever abandoned the place at which he had spent two years in building and hunting. The fort was abandoned for centuries. Khairigarh first reappears in deeds granted to the kan\u00fango family, which held office both in Khairigarh and Kheri. A deed signed by Akbar (1556\u20131605) recites that Ahbaran, an Ah\u00edr of Khairigarh, had usurped dominion, and was oppressing the people; and it directs the destruction of this chieftain, whose head-quarters were at Kundanpur, near Khairigarh. The landholders of the pargan\u00e1 at that time were B\u00e1chhils, Bisens, Bais, and Kurmis. The B\u00e1chhils were succeeded by the Rajp\u00fatis, and these latter, in their turn, were ousted by the Loh\u00e1ni Banj\u00e1ras in the reign of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. R\u00e1o R\u00e1m Singh was the Banj\u00e1ra chief at the beginning of the present century. He was a turbulent man, and his exactions led to a rebellion on the part of his own people, and his\ndefeat in 1800. In the following year, Khairigarh came into the hands of the British, being part of the territories ceded by the Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edr. It remained in their possession till 1816, when it was handed over to Oudh in exchange for a part of Jaunpur. In 1809, the English sent a force to punish the R\u00e1j\u00e1 for his cruelty and exactions. He was taken prisoner and carried to Bareilly, where he died. His successor, in 1830, was ousted by the Surajbans Kshattriyas, who had an ancient claim to the land, and to which tribe the present R\u00e1j\u00e1 belongs. Khairigarh finally came into British possession on the annexation of Oudh.\n\nKhairigarh.\u2014Chief village in Khairigarh pargan\u00e1, Kheri District, Oudh; situated on the left bank of the Suheli river, 110 miles north of Lucknow. Lat. 28\u00b0 20' 35\" N., long. 80\u00b0 52' 55\" E. Population (1869) 1135; (1881) 1278. Built by Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Tughlak, in order to check the depredations of mountaineers from Nep\u00e1l and Kum\u00e1un. Tieffenthaler, describing its condition eighty years ago, states it to be a fortified place, worthy of note as well on account of its excellent construction as of its size, being 4 or 5 miles in circuit. The defences are built of huge blocks of stone below, and of bricks of unusual size above; but it now lies waste, and the site is infested with tigers and other wild beasts. The town is 2 miles north-east of the great fort, the intervening space being overgrown with trees and grassy jungle.\n\nKhairi-Murat.\u2014Mountain range in R\u00e1wal Pindi District, Punjab; midway between the Soh\u00e1n river and the Chitta Pah\u00e1r. Rises about 30 miles from the Indus, and runs eastward for some 24 miles, a dreary ridge of barren limestone and sandstone rock. Lat. 33\u00b0 28' N., long. 72\u00b0 49' 30\" E. North of the range lies a plateau intersected by ravines; while southward a waste of gorges and hillocks extends in a belt for a distance of 5 miles, till it dips into the fertile valley of the Soh\u00e1n, one of the richest tracts in R\u00e1wal Pindi District. The Khairi-Murat was formerly covered with jungle, but is now completely destitute of vegetation, except where the hill has been formed into a reserved forest, and closed to grazing. In these parts the trees are rapidly springing up again.\n\nKhairpur.\u2014Native State in Upper Sind, also known as the territories of the M\u00edr \u00c1li Mur\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n Talpur; lying between 26\u00b0 10' and 27\u00b0 46' N. lat., and between 68\u00b0 14' and 70\u00b0 13' E. long. Bounded on the north by Shik\u00e1rpur District; on the east by Jaisalmer (Jeysulmere) State; on the south by Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) District; and on the west by the river Indus. Its greatest length from east to west calculated at 120 miles, and its breadth from north to south at 70 miles; area, 6109 square miles. Population (1881) 129,153 persons.\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Like other parts of Sind, Khairpur consists of a great alluvial plain, the part bordering directly upon the Indus being very rich and fertile, though much of it is converted into mah\u0101ris, or hunting-grounds. With the exception of the fertile strip watered by the Indus and the Eastern N\u00e1ra (a canal which follows an old bed of the Indus), the remainder or three-fourths of the whole area is a continuous series of sandhill ridges covered with a stunted brushwood, where cultivation is altogether impossible. The country generally is exceedingly arid, sterile, and desolate in aspect. In the northern portion of the State is a small ridge of limestone hills, being a continuation of the low range known as the Ghar, which runs southward from Rohri for a distance of about 40 miles. On the top of the range are found oyster, cockle, and numerous other kinds of marine shells. On a western outlying spur of this ridge is situated the fort of Diji. About 150,000 acres of land in all are under cultivation.\n\nKhairpur is watered by five canals, drawn off from the Indus river, as well as by the Eastern N\u00e1ra. The largest and most important of these canals is the M\u00edrwah; and it is upon the land watered by this stream and its branches that much of the indigo grown in the State is produced. There are several cuts from the M\u00edrwah canal, which extend to the valleys near the sandhills, where the soil is apparently fertile, and largely cultivated on the occurrence of a good rainfall. No separate canal department exists under the M\u00edr\u2019s rule; but when the clearing out of silt becomes necessary, it is generally done by the cultivators themselves, who receive for this work about a pound of flour per diem. The Eastern N\u00e1ra, which irrigates a portion of the State, is a petty stream, except during the rains, when it spreads out into wide sheets of water; in the dry season it is but a series of sluggish pools. The belt of land through which this stream flows is composed of rich alluvial soil, at present almost wholly uncultivated, but capable of producing excellent crops.\n\nThe soil of Khairpur, especially in the strip adjoining the Indus, is very productive. The tract lying between the M\u00edrwah Canal and the Indus is the richest part of the State, but cultivation is even there by no means so extensive as it might be. In the desert portion of Khairpur are pits of natron\u2014an impure sesqui-carbonate of soda, always containing sulphate of soda and chloride of sodium. It is generally obtained by means of evaporation. The natron pits are a source of income to the M\u00edr, as many as a thousand camel-loads of this substance being annually exported to Northern and Central India, and also to the seaboard, each camel-load being taxed at 5s.\n\nThe wild animals found in Khairpur are the tiger, lynx, hyaena, wolf, jackal, fox, wild hog, deer, hare, and antelope. The birds and water-fowl are those common to Sind generally, such as bustard, wild geese,\nsnipe, partridges (both black and grey), and various kinds of wild duck (which arrive in the cold season). The reptiles are also the same as those common to the Province, and snakes abound as in other parts of Sind. The domestic animals comprise the camel, horse, buffalo, bullock, sheep, goat, mule, and donkey.\n\n**History.**\u2014The present chief of Khairpur belongs to a Baluch family called Talpur; and, previous to the accession of this family, on the fall of the Kalhor\u00e1 dynasty of Sind in 1783, the history of Khairpur belongs to the general history of Sind. In that year M\u00edr Fateh Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n Talpur established himself as *Ra\u00eds* or ruler of Sind; and subsequently his nephew Mir Sohr\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n Talpur, with two sons, named M\u00edr Rustam and Al\u00ed Mur\u00e1d, founded the Khairpur branch of the Talpur rulers of Sind. The dominions of M\u00edr Sohr\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n were at first confined to the town of Khairpur and a small adjacent tract of country; but by conquest and intrigue he managed to enlarge them, until they extended to Sabzalkot and Kashmor on the north, to the Jaisalmer Desert on the east, and to the borders of Kachchh Gand\u00e1va on the west. About the year 1813, during the troubles in K\u00e1b\u00fal incidental to the establishment of the B\u00e1r\u00e1kzai dynasty, the M\u00edrs were able to refuse the further payment of the tribute which up to that date had been somewhat irregularly paid to the rulers of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n. Two years earlier than this, in 1811, M\u00edr Sohr\u00e1b had abdicated in favour of his son M\u00edr Rustam. But he appears to have endeavoured to modify this arrangement subsequently; and ultimately the jealousy between the two brothers, M\u00edr Rustam and Al\u00ed Mur\u00e1d, was one of the factors in the crisis that called in the intervention of the British power.\n\nIn 1832, the individuality of the Khairpur State, as separate from the other Talpur M\u00edrs in Sind, was recognised by the Government in a treaty, under which the use of the river Indus and the roads of Sind were secured to the British. When the first K\u00e1b\u00fal expedition was decided on, the Sind M\u00edrs were required to assist the passage of the British through their territories, and allow of the occupation of Shik\u00e1rpur; most of the princes showed great disinclination to comply with these demands. But in Khairpur, Al\u00ed Mur\u00e1d, who gradually succeeded in establishing his hold on the *ra\u00edsat*, or chiefship, cordially supported the British policy; and the result was that, after the battles of Mi\u00e1n\u00ed (Meeanee) and Daba had put the whole of Sind at the disposal of the British Government, Khairpur was the only State in that Province that was allowed to retain its political existence under the protection of the paramount power. In 1866, a *sanad* was granted to the present Chief, under which the British Government promised to recognise any succession to the Chiefship that might be in accordance with Muhammadan law. The present ruler of Khairpur, His Highness M\u00edr Al\u00ed Mur\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n, mentioned above as the youngest son of M\u00edr\nSohrab Khan Talpur, was born in the year 1815. He is entitled to a salute of 15 guns.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of Khairpur, according to the Census of 1872, was returned at 130,350 persons, or 21 persons to each square mile. The Census taken on February 17, 1881, returned the population at 129,153, there being in the intervening period of nine years a hardly appreciable decrease of 1197. Of the total, 70,746 were males, and 58,407 females, the whole inhabiting 25,720 houses. The density of population remains at 21 persons to the square mile as in 1872; houses per square mile, 4\u00b72; persons per house, 5. In point of religion, Hindus numbered 26,727, or 20\u00b77 per cent. of the whole population; Muhammadans, who are in a great majority, 102,426, or 79\u00b73 per cent. Among the Hindus were 213 Brahmins, 7 Rajputs, 25,415 Lohanas (Government servants and the shopkeeping classes), and 'unspecified,' 1092. The Muhammadans include 12,276 Baluchis; 690 Pathans; 2297 Sayyids; 1466 Shaikhs; Sindhis, 77,524; 'unspecified,' 8173. The Muhammadans mostly belong to the Rajur tribe, which is again subdivided into numerous families. The Hindu inhabitants are principally Soda Thakurs, or Rajputs, who inhabit the extreme eastern part of the State. They are a well-built and sturdy race, nomadic in their habits, and fond of a life of freedom. Their only wealth consists in their herds of camels, oxen, sheep, and goats. Their chief food is butter-milk or camel's milk, and the coarsest grain. Sindh\u00ed, Persian, and Baluchi are the languages chiefly spoken.\n\nThe Census divides the male population into the following six main groups as regards occupation:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every kind and the learned professions, 2025; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 1191; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 456; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including shepherds, 28,644; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 9407; and (6) indefinite and non-productive classes, comprising general labourers, male children, and 'unspecified,' 29,023.\n\nTrade and Manufactures, etc.\u2014The value of the articles annually exported from Khairpur to British Sind and the Native State of Jaisalmer has been approximately estimated at about 54 l\u00f3khs of rupees (\u00a352,500), and that of the imported articles at somewhat more than 2\u00bd l\u00f3khs (\u00a325,000). The principal exports are indigo, wool, cotton, grain, tobacco, twine, and skins. The imports are rice, wheat, barley, sugar, and piece-goods. The chief manufactures are cotton fabrics, such as woven sheets and coloured cloth; silk fabrics, silver-ware of different kinds, lacquered wood-work, boots, shoes, horse trappings, swords, matchlocks, and earthen pottery for home consumption. A\nsmall quantity of salt and saltpetre is also manufactured. The lines of communication in the State are very few. Excepting the main trunk road from Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d to Rohri, which passes through Khairpur at a distance of about 20 miles from the Indus, and another road connecting the same towns by a somewhat more direct route, there are no made roads in M\u00edr Ali Mur\u00e1d\u2019s territory. The telegraph runs along the trunk road. The ferries, chiefly on the Indus, are six in number, and have each one boat attached to them. They are\u2014(1) Bindu, (2) Al\u00edpur, (3) Saga, (4) Rafid\u00edr, (5) Agro, (6) N\u00farpur.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The principal grains grown in the State are jo\u00e1r (Sorghum vulgare), b\u00e1jra (Pennisetum typhoideum), wheat, gram, various pulses, and cotton. Indigo is also largely cultivated. The fruit-trees are the mango (Mangifera indica), mulberry, apple, pomegranate, date, and others. The forest-trees are the pipal (Ficus religiosa), nim (Melia Azadirachta indica), ber (Zizyphus jujuba), siras (Dalbergia latifolia), tali (Dalbergia sissoo) bahan (Populus euphratica), and kandi (Prosopis spicigera). The bush jungle consists principally of tamarisk; reed grasses are abundant. There is good timber in the game preserves bordering on the Indus. The kandi tree grows luxuriantly in the valleys.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The rule of the M\u00edr is a patriarchal system of government like that of the chief of a Scottish highland clan. The village system has died out in Khairpur as in the rest of Sind. The gross revenue of Khairpur, collected not in cash but in kind, the M\u00edr receiving one-third of the produce, amounted in 1882\u201383 to \u00a357,250. From this about \u00a317,000 must be deducted for j\u00e1g\u00edrs or alienations. The j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs are mostly the M\u00edr\u2019s own sons and the ladies of his family. The British Collector at Shik\u00e1rpur acts as a Political Agent in regard to the State.\n\nThere are only two courts of justice in the State; one permanent, and held at the town of Khairpur; the other of an itinerant nature, always accompanying the M\u00edr wherever he may be. A Hindu officer presides over the former, and two Muhammadan Maulvis over the latter. All sentences passed by these courts require the M\u00edr\u2019s confirmation before they can be carried out. The punishments resorted to in the case of convicted persons are generally fine and flogging, with or without imprisonment. The punishment of death is seldom inflicted, but the Mir has the power of life and death throughout his dominions. In civil cases the plaintiff is required to give to the State one-fourth of his claim as costs and expenses; and it is, no doubt, on this account that but few suits are brought in the M\u00edr\u2019s courts, the litigating parties preferring to have them settled by means of panch\u00e1yats, or friendly arbitration. Registration is done by k\u00e1z\u00eds or subordinate officers, and the documents are attested by the k\u00e1rd\u00e1rs and zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs. In 1882\u201383,\n424 offences were reported to the police, mostly cattle-thefts. The daily jail average was 101 prisoners. The military force consists of about 50 men fairly mounted, and armed with swords and matchlocks. Repairs to canals in 1882 cost \u00a31720. A preventive service to check opium-smuggling from Jaisalmer State is being organized. Number of schools in the State, 6; number of scholars, 240. Persian is specially attended to by M\u00fallas, who, for the instruction they afford, receive 1 pice (\u00bdd.) weekly from the parents of each child.\n\nClimate, Medical Aspects, etc.\u2014The climate of Khairpur is represented to be agreeable during about four months of the year, but fiercely hot during the remaining eight. The fall of rain is slight, but dust storms are frequent, and have the effect of cooling the atmosphere to some extent. The diseases common to the country are fevers, intermittent and remittent, ophthalmia, and several cutaneous affections. Organic affections of the liver are said to be rare. 2850 persons were vaccinated in 1882-83. In the same year there were 2 native physicians attached to the Mir's camp, while 3 more were resident in Khairpur town, to give advice and medicine to the inhabitants free of charge.\n\nKhairpur.\u2014Chief town of Khairpur State, Sind, Bombay Presidency; situated on the Mirwah Canal, about 15 miles east of the river Indus, and 17 miles south of Rohri. Lat. 27\u00b0 31' 30\" N., long. 68\u00b0 48' 30\" E. The town, which is irregularly built, consists of a collection of mud hovels, intermingled with a few houses of a better class. It is very filthy, and, owing to the excessive heat of the place, and the deleterious influence of the stagnant marshes around it, decidedly unhealthy. The palace, covered with gaudy lacquered tiles of various hues, is situate in the midst of the b\u00e1z\u00e1r, and presents but few points worthy of notice. Outside the town stand the tombs of two Muhammadan saints\u2014P\u00edr Ruhan Z\u00eda-ud-din and H\u00e1ji Ja\u015bar Sh\u00e1hid. The population, consisting of Muhammadans and Hindus, the former of whom greatly predominate in number, is estimated by some at from 4000 to 5000 persons, but by others as high as 10,000; in 1875, it was returned at 7275. The population of Khairpur town is not returned separately in the Census Report of 1881.\n\nDuring the flourishing period of the Talpur dynasty, Khairpur is said to have possessed not less than 15,000 inhabitants, but the place is now fast hastening to ruin and decay. The trade of Khairpur is principally in indigo, grain (jo\u00e1r and bajra), and oil-seeds, which form the chief articles of export; the imports being piece-goods, silk, cotton, wool, metals, etc. The manufactures comprise the weaving and dyeing of cloths of various kinds, goldsmith's work, and the making of firearms, swords, etc. On the present site of the town of Khairpur, which owes its rise to M\u00edr Sohr\u00e1b Kh\u00e1n Talpur, there stood, prior\nto the year 1787, the village of Boira, and the zam\u012bnd\u0101r\u012b or estate of the Phulpotras. It was selected as the residence of the chief M\u012brs of Northern Sind; and for some time during Talpur rule, a British Resident was stationed here, in terms of the treaty of 20th April 1838, concluded between the British Government and the M\u012brs of Sind.\n\nKhairpur.\u2014Town and municipality in Alipur tahs\u012bl, Muzaffargarh District, Punjab; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 20' N., long. 70\u00b0 51' E., 6 miles south-west of Alipur, on a depressed site, below flood-level from the Chen\u0101b, and therefore surrounded by an embankment, which has to be kept up at a considerable outlay. The town is compactly built, chiefly of brick, many of the houses being two and three storied. The b\u0101z\u0101rs are mostly paved with brick, but the streets are too narrow to admit of wheeled traffic. Population (1868) 2846; (1881) 2609; namely, Hindus, 1549, and Muhammadans, 1060; number of houses, 271. A third-class municipality, with an income in 1881-82 of \u00a3295; average incidence of taxation, 2s. 3\u00bdd. per head of the population. The inhabitants are enterprising traders, and their trade with Baluchist\u00e1n, Sakkar (Sukkur), M\u00falt\u00e1n, and other places at a distance is larger than that of any other town in the District. The exports consist principally of wool, cotton, and grain; the imports of cloth and sundries. The town contains a primary school, and has a police outpost station.\n\nKhairpur Dharki.\u2014Town in Rohri Sub-division, Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; situated about 65 miles north-east of Rohri town. Lat. 28\u00b0 3' N., long. 69\u00b0 44' 30\" E. Head-quarters of a tapp\u0101-d\u0101r, with a musafirkh\u0101na (travellers' rest-house); vernacular school; th\u00e1n\u0101 police force of 7 men; and cattle pound. Connected by road with the towns of Ubauro, Rawati, Mirpur, and Raharki. Population (1881) under 2000. The trade of Khairpur Dharki is principally in grain, sugar, molasses, oil, and cloth. The Loh\u0101rs are noted for their handiwork in metal pots, pipe bowls, knives, razors, etc. The Dhars, who were once the principal landowners in Ubauro t\u0101luk, are thus referred to by Lieutenant Lester, a former Deputy Collector, in his Report (1852) on the Districts on the left bank of the Indus:\n\n'The Dhars are a race of Musalm\u00e1ns, originally Hindus, who emigrated from their native country of Tonk Jodah, near Delhi, under their chief, one Jodh Dhar, and settled in Ubauro. This migration took place about A.H. 551 (A.D. 1150). The Dhars took Ubauro by force of arms from the Odh\u00e1nas, a Muhammadan race, who formerly possessed it, and Jodh Dhar became the acknowledged ruler of Ubauro. Al\u00edm Kh\u00e1n, the twelfth chief from Jodh Dhar, was the first who surrendered his independence. He became subject to the kings of Delhi about A.D. 1634; and one of the first sanads is dated A.H. 1052 (A.D. 1626), by which one-half of the grain produce is allowed to the\nDhar chief, and the other half taken by the Delhi Government. About A.D. 1795, the Talpur chiefs, M\u00edrs Sohr\u00e1b and Rustam, wrested from the chief of Ubauro some of the west and south-west parts of that pargan\u00e1 near Sirhad, and called this acquired territory \"N\u00e1o Kh\u00e1lsa.\" The Dhars were, however, allowed the zamind\u00e1ri of these lands. In 1817, the Talpurs took Sabzalkot, two-thirds of which were appropriated to the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d M\u00edrs, and one-third to M\u00edr Rustam. The Talpurs continued to encroach by degrees on the possessions of the Dhars in Ubauro, until one-half only remained in the possession of the latter. At length, on the death of Bhamb\u00fa Kh\u00e1n, his son, Ab\u00fal Khair, was only allowed an eighth share of the revenue, besides zamind\u00e1ri.\n\nThe town of Khairpur Dharki is comparatively modern, having been founded about 1787 by the grandfather of J\u00e1m Ab\u00fal Khair Dhar, the present head of the Dhar tribe. The Khairpur station (11 miles southwest of the Reti station) on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway is near the town.\n\n**Khairpur Juso.**\u2014Village in L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na Sub-division, Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; situated about 10 miles south-west of L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na town.

Population (1881) 3492, namely, males 1682, and females 1810; prevailing caste, Br\u00e1hmans. For police and conservancy purposes, a house-tax is levied, amounting in 1881-82 to \u00a3105. The town retains some architectural remains of ancient grandeur, including the B\u00e1gh Badsh\u00e1hi, a large enclosed garden with a b\u00e1rad\u00e1ri at the eastern end, and a considerable masonry tank; the gateway and walls of the handsome old sar\u00e1i, through which ran the Mughal road to Agra and Et\u00e1wah; and a fine Hindu temple, dedicated to Siva, with a tank known as the Randon-ka-tal\u00e1o. A large religious fair is held here in October.

Hiuen Tsiang mentions it in the 7th century; and General Cunningham attributes to the same date a single pillared temple called Ganthai, and a high mound which probably conceals the ruins of a Buddhist monastery. Numerous inscriptions of the Chandel kings have been discovered at various places in the neighbourhood. Upwards of twenty temples still stand in the town, and the ruins of at least as many more bear witness to its former greatness. On one alone, General Cunningham counted over eight hundred statues of half life-size, and eight sculptured elephants of like proportions. The inner shrine of this edifice constituted in itself a splendid temple, and was crowded with figures. Captain Burt noticed seven large temples of exquisite carving, whose mechanical construction adapted them to last for almost indefinite periods. Most or all of these noble buildings must be referred to the\nChandel dynasty, who ruled at Khajur\u00e1hu, apparently from A.D. 841 to 1157. The modern village contains only about 160 houses.\n\nKhaj\u00fari.\u2014Guaranteed chiefship of Central India.\u2014See Kaj\u00fari.\n\nKhakereru.\u2014South-eastern tahsil of Fatehpur District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the north bank of the Jumna river, and comprising the pargan\u00e1s of Dh\u00e1ta and Ekdala.

After Naw\u00e1nagar, the town of most importance in the State; it was the residence of the J\u00e1m or chief until the death of the Emperor Aurangzeb. Khambh\u00e1l\u00eda is an ancient town, and was formerly a possession of the V\u00e1dhels, from whom it was conquered by J\u00e1m R\u00e1wal. It contains several old temples.

Area, 441 square miles; contains 2 towns and 129 villages. Population (1867) 76,726; (1881) 96,179, namely, 50,558 males and 45,621 females, or 218\npersons per square mile. Occupied houses, 17,482; unoccupied, 1777; towns and villages per square mile, '3; houses per square mile, 43\u00b76; persons per house, 5\u00b75.

Total revenue, \u00a329,304, of which \u00a323,408 is derived from land.\n\nKh\u00e1mg\u00e1on.\u2014Town and municipality in Akola District, Ber\u00e1r. Lat. 20\u00b0 42' 30\" N., long. 76\u00b0 37' 30\" E. Population (1881) 12,390, namely, 6718 males and 5672 females. Of the total population, 9337 were returned as Hindus, 2603 as Muhammadans, 87 as Christians, 314 as Jains, and 41 as Parsis. A large cotton market and the emporium of the western Districts of the Province for opium. The grain trade of the town is also of considerable importance. Trade was first established about 1820, when a few dealers opened shops and began to deal in gh\u00ed, yarn, and a little cotton. A branch State railway of 8 miles, opened in 1870, connects Kh\u00e1mg\u00e1on with the Nagpur branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway at Jalamb station. It is only worked about seven months in the year, from December to July, during the cotton season; in the remaining months a contractor is allowed to conduct a lorry service for the convenience of travellers. It is also made use of to a considerable extent for grain and other goods, being able to compete successfully with ordinary carts for light loads. Latterly, considerable supplies of cotton have been diverted from Kh\u00e1mg\u00e1on to Sheg\u00e1on, on the Nagpur branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. In good seasons, above 100,000 bullock-loads of cotton are brought into Kh\u00e1mg\u00e1on. The weekly market is held on Thursdays, and during the busy season it is very largely attended. A branch of the Bombay Bank is open for business during six months.\n\nThe town is surrounded by low irregular hills. To the east is a large enclosed cotton market, having a small building in the centre used as an exchange room. There are upwards of 400 public and private wells; but the water in many of them has become contaminated, and a large tank is being constructed (1883) a mile and a half from the town, which it is calculated will afford an abundant supply of pure drinking water. The cost of this work is estimated at \u00a318,000, half of which will be borne by the town. The public buildings are\u2014the Assistant Commissioner's courthouse; a tahsil; a handsome sarai; travellers' bungalow; dispensary, telegraph and post offices; police stations; three school-houses; market shed. Of the private buildings, those erected by the European merchants are the most conspicuous; of these, the principal are the\nFrench Press Company's, the New Ber\u00e1r Company's, the Kh\u00e1mga\u00f3n Pressing Company's, and the Mofussil Pressing Company's factories, which all possess steam machinery for full-pressing cotton. Several gardens in the town produce good oranges and vegetables. The Assistant Commissioner is judge of the Small-Cause Court, and has a Magistrate's full powers; a tahsild\u00e1r is also stationed at Kh\u00e1mga\u00f3n, and there is a sub-treasury. The imports into Kh\u00e1mga\u00f3n by rail in 1882-83 were valued at \u00a3316,081, and the exports at \u00a3673,148. Kh\u00e1mga\u00f3n is a municipality. In 1882-83, the municipal receipts were \u00a31959; expenditure, \u00a31742; incidence of taxation, 10\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits. The daily average attendance at the dispensary was 48 in 1882.\n\nKhamti Hills and Tribe.\u2014A tract of country on the extreme eastern frontier of Assam, bordering on Lakhimpur District; occupied by the Khamt\u00eds, a hill tribe of Shan origin, akin to the Ahams. The seat of this tribe for centuries, and still inhabited by them, is the hilly country at the sources of the Nawadi river, known as Bar-khamt\u00ed, which was visited by Captain Wilcox in 1826. About the middle of last century, owing to internal dissensions, a colony of Khamt\u00eds migrated into Assam and established themselves in the division of Sadiy\u00e1. Their chief assumed the title of Sadiy\u00e1 Kho\u00e1 Gos\u00e1in, and was recognised by the British Government. On his death, the division of Sadiy\u00e1 was taken under British administration, and difficulties arose with the Khamt\u00eds. In 1839 they cut off the outpost at Sadiy\u00e1, with its garrison of Sepoys and British commandant. This outbreak was sternly suppressed, and for several years the Khamt\u00eds led a hunted life. They have now resumed peaceful habits, and new colonies of their tribesmen from beyond the frontier have recently joined their settlements on the Teng\u00e1pan\u00ed and No\u00e1 Dihing rivers.\n\nAccording to the Census of 1872, the total number of Khamt\u00eds in the settled portion of Lakhimpur District was 1562 souls. In 1881, the number was returned at 2883. The Khamt\u00eds are far in advance of all the neighbouring tribes in knowledge, arts, and civilisation. They are Buddhists, and in their own country have regular establishments of priests, well versed in the mysteries of that religion. The majority of the laity can read and write their own language, the boys of each village being (as in Burma) instructed by the village priest or b\u00e1pu. The priests carve with great taste in wood, bone, or ivory. The chiefs pride themselves upon their manual dexterity in working in metals, and in ornamenting their shields of buffalo or rhinoceros hide with gold and lac. The women are skilled in embroidery. The dress of both men and women is marked by simplicity and neatness, and closely resembles that of the Burmese.\n\nThe principal settlement of the Khamt\u00eds in Assam proper is at N\u00e1r\u00e1-\nyanpur, and the following description of the little colony is derived from the Assam Census Report of 1881:\u2014'The colony at Narayanpur affords a good example of the mode of life characteristic of the Khamtis in Assam. The houses are built on platforms raised a few feet above the ground. The chief's house is a very large structure, 90 feet long by 30 feet broad, with the customary deep verandah or porch in front. Both men and women still retain their national costume, viz. a blue cotton jacket and kilt of chequered cloth for the former, and for the latter a blue cloth tied under the arms and reaching down nearly to the ankles, with a jacket above. Thus attired, the women may be seen of an evening bringing in large loads of firewood to the village. Both sexes have that robust and well-nourished appearance which distinguishes the non-Aryan races of Assam from the Hindu, whenever the former have not yet been persuaded to relinquish their freedom of eating and drinking. Though professedly followers of the Buddhist religion, the Khamti laity eat all kinds of flesh (except beef), and drink strong liquors, but their priests are bound to abstinence. The Bapuchang, or monastery, is a large house outside their village, with only two residents, an old man who has lived there five-and-thirty years, and a young lad in training to be his successor. Their daily meal of rice and curried vegetables is supplied to them by the women of the village. The interior of the home is occupied by the carpets and beds of the priests, their domestic utensils, and a shrine with a red canopy, containing several images of Gautama, one of which is a clay model three feet high, and gilded, but of coarse workmanship, while another is a small image of white marble, and both are of the ordinary Buddhist type. The priests shave their heads, and wear a yellow dress.\n\n'The doctrines of their religion are contained in sacred books written in the Khamti character, but believed in some cases to be of the Pali language. They have not, however, any very definite notion of the religion they profess. They celebrate Thursday as the birthday of Gautama, or Kodoma, as they call him, but of the month and year of his birth they are ignorant. Their principal feasts are on the full moon of Asarh and Asin. The common people worship both Kodoma and the Hindu goddess Debi or Durga, but they are not the followers of any Gosain, and they employ in her service their own priests, instead of Brahmans. The priests of Debi are called Pomu, while those of Kodoma are called Thomon (Assamese, b\u0101pu). Fowls, pigs, and buffaloes may be offered to Debi, but not a duck nor a goat; the service of Kodoma consists of floral offerings only. The worship of Durga, like the custom of burning their dead, is said by themselves to date from time immemorial, but it seems more probable that both practices have been adopted from the Hindus with whom this little colony has been thrown so intimately into contact. The Khamtis of\nSadiy\u00e1, in Colonel Dalton\u2019s time at least, used not only to bury their dead, but to preserve the graves with particular care. The chief man of the colony, who has adopted the Hindu name of Mani Ram, is the grandson of the old Sadiy\u00e1-khoa, whose office was taken away in 1839.\n\nClosely allied to the Khamt\u00eds, and, indeed, undistinguished from them in the Census, are four tribes, known as K\u00e1mjangs, Aitonias, P\u00e1n\u00ed Noras, and Phaki\u00e1ls. They are of somewhat inferior status, and are not allowed to take wives from the Khamt\u00eds, who, however, do not object to taking wives from them. A full account of the Khamt\u00ed tribe will be found in Colonel Dalton\u2019s Ethnology of Bengal (Calcutta, 1872), which has been quoted at length in the Statistical Account of Assam, vol. i. pp. 309\u2013315 (Tr\u00fcbner & Co., London, 1879).\n\nKh\u00e1n (or K\u00e1n).\u2014River of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, Central India, rising in lat. 22\u00b0 36\u2032 N., and long. 75\u00b0 55\u2032 E., on the north side of the Vindhyan range, 8 miles east of Mau (Mhow). It flows in a northerly direction through a very fertile country until it is joined by the Saraswat\u00ed. It then takes a north-easterly direction for about 19 miles, and eventually falls into the Sipr\u00e1, in lat. 23\u00b0 8\u2032 N., long. 75\u00b0 50\u2032 E. On the route from Mau to Ujjain, about 12 miles from the source of this river, there is a good ford.\n\nKh\u00e1napur (formerly known as Bidi).\u2014Sub-division of Belg\u00e1um District, Bombay Presidency. The most southern Sub-division of the District, known as Bidi till 1868\u201369, in which year the head-quarters was transferred from Bidi to Kh\u00e1napur, and the name of the Sub-division changed. It contains 219 villages, with an area of 632 square miles; population (1872) 78,875, (1881) 79,264, or 125 persons per square mile; land revenue, \u00a311,308. Of the 632 square miles, 626\u00b77 had been surveyed in detail in 1882; 86 square miles were occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The remainder contains 156,669 acres of arable land, 1796 acres of uncultivable land, 1690 acres of grass, 174,534 acres of forests, and 12,664 acres of village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. Of the total, 36,400 acres are alienated lands in Government villages. The south and south-west of Kh\u00e1napur is crowded with hills and dense forest, the people are few and unsettled, and, except in patches, tillage disappears. In the north-west the hills are especially lofty. In the centre, north-east, and east, the country is an open, well-tilled black soil plain, with many rich and populous villages. The climate is temperate and healthy during the hot months, feverish in the cold season, and sickly during the southwest rains. At Kh\u00e1napur town, during the ten years ending in 1882, the rainfall averaged 63 inches. In 1881\u201382, of 94,727 acres held for tillage, 36,143 acres were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 58,584 acres, 2706 were twice cropped. Of the 61,290 acres under tillage, grain occupied 52,231 acres; pulse, 5722; oil-seeds, 2184; fibres,\n64; and miscellaneous crops, 999. About 20 miles of the West Deccan line of the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Railway pass from north to south through the centre of the Sub-division, and about 21 miles of the Bellary-Marmagoa Railway along the southern boundary. In 1882, there were 15 schools in the Sub-division. [Kh\u00e1napur Sub-division was formerly known as Bidi, and it has been described under that name in Volume II. of this edition of the Imperial Gazetteer of India. Since the short article BIDI was written, the further materials here given under Kh\u00e1napur have been obtained.]\n\nKh\u00e1napur.\u2014Town in the Kh\u00e1napur Sub-division of Belg\u00e1um District, Bombay Presidency. Situated in lat. 15\u00b0 37' N., and long. 74\u00b0 34' E., on the Malprabha river, about 16 miles south of Belg\u00e1um town. Head-quarters of the Sub-division, with a population of 3516 in 1872, and of 4016 in 1881. About 1720, Kh\u00e1napur was a large entrep\u00f4t for Goa merchants with drugs, China goods, metals, and spices; they were met here by merchants from Hubli, Narg\u00fand, and Nawalg\u00fand with cloth, cotton, and saltpetre. This trade was destroyed about 1810 by the Kittur Desai, who removed it to Nandgar, seven miles south-east of Kh\u00e1napur. Besides the revenue and police offices of the Sub-division, the town contains a school, post-office, rest-house, and Portuguese mission with a chapel. It is a station on the West Deccan line of the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Railway.\n\nKh\u00e1n\u00e1pur.\u2014Sub-division of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 531 square miles; contains 1 town and 90 villages. Population (1872) 76,783; (1881) 80,327, namely, 40,388 males and 39,939 females, occupying 11,245 houses. Hindus numbered 76,768; Muhammadans, 2989; and 'others,' 570. Since 1872 the population has increased by 3544. The Sub-division contains 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; police station (th\u00e1n\u00e1), 1; regular police, 44 men; village watchmen (chauki-d\u00e1rs), 135. Land revenue, \u00a316,693.\n\nKh\u00e1nbaila.\u2014Town in Bah\u00e1walpur State, Punjab; a place of some importance, near the left bank of the Panjnad. Lat. 29\u00b0 4' N., long. 70\u00b0 52' E. The neighbouring country, fertilized by the inundations, produces abundant crops of grain.\n\nKhand\u00e1la.\u2014Sanatarium in Poona (P\u00fana) District, Bombay Presidency. Situated about 41 miles north-west of Poona city, on the Western Gh\u00e1ts; a favourite retreat of the inhabitants of Bombay during the summer months. There is a much admired waterfall, distant about half a mile, consisting in the rainy season of two cataracts, divided into an upper and a lower fall. The upper cataract has a sheer fall of 300 feet. The village of Khand\u00e1la is extending since the opening of the south extension of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, on which it is a station.\n\nKh\u00e1nd\u00e1nsa.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in B\u00edk\u00e1pur tahsil, Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d)\nDistrict, Oudh; situated along the north bank of the G\u00fant\u00ed. It contains 128 villages, covering 116 square miles, of which 65 are cultivated. Population (1869) 70,905; (1881) 67,712, namely, 62,542 Hindus and 5170 Muhammadans. Tradition states that about six hundred years ago, one Kh\u00e1nde, a Bhar chief, while on a pilgrimage to Ajodhya with his brothers, came to the neighbourhood of the present Kh\u00e1nd\u00e1nsa, and, finding it fertile and uninhabited, took possession of it and founded four villages\u2014Kh\u00e1nd\u00e1nsa, Urwa, Bhakauli, and Dehli Girdhar\u2014calling them after his own and his brothers\u2019 names. The pargan\u00e1 remained in the hands of the Bhars, until one Deo R\u00e1i, a Bisen of Manjhauli, happened to stop at Bhakauli on his way to bathe in the Ganges. During his stay, a quarrel arose between him and the Bhars, which ended in his putting them to the sword and taking possession of Bhakauli. Subsequently, his descendants made themselves masters of Urwa and Kh\u00e1nd\u00e1nsa, with other villages in neighbouring pargan\u00e1s, of which, after the lapse of thirty-five generations, they are still zamind\u00e1rs.\n\nKh\u00e1ndauli (Kanauli).\u2014Village in Bh\u00e1galpur District, Bengal; situated within a short distance of the Nep\u00e1l frontier. Lat. 26\u00b0 26' 58\" N., long. 86\u00b0 49' 6\" E. Although the population is small (1955 in 1881), a large bi-weekly market is held here, which is one of the most flourishing seats of trade in the north of the District. Since the opening of the T\u00edrh\u00fat State Railway to Darbhanga, Kh\u00e1ndauli has much increased in commercial importance. It not only exports large quantities of rice, oil-seeds, mahu\u00e1, and other country produce, but imports salt, cloth, spices, etc. for distribution to smaller b\u00e1z\u00e1rs, and also for export to Nep\u00e1l. Since 1875, Kh\u00e1ndauli has been a station for the registration of traffic with Nep\u00e1l.\n\nKh\u00e1ndauli (or Ihtimadpur).\u2014Tahsil of Agra District, North-Western Provinces; lying in the Do\u00e1b portion of the District, along the north bank of the Jumna, and much intersected by ravines, which intersect the country for miles from the river bank. These ravines are distinctive features of the country, which exhibits three separate and strongly-marked divisions. First, the tract above the ravines, and removed from their influence, which forms the main area of the tahsil, and the soil of which is, with rare exceptions, a rich and productive loam. Second, the ravines and adjacent parts, which are for the most part sterile; and third, the low-lying alluvial or kh\u00e1dar tract below the ravines, and along the river bank. The kh\u00e1dar is often a mere narrow belt of sand capable of supporting only melons. The ownership in this tract is, moreover, precarious, as it is liable to be cut away by constant changes in the river bed. The tahsil is intersected by the East Indian Railway, with stations at Tundl\u00e1 and Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d. Water communication is afforded by the Jumna, although river traffic has greatly diminished of late years. There are also several good lines\nof road, metalled and unmetalled. Towns and markets are almost absent, and there is no manufacture or trade worth mention; what little there is consists chiefly of native-made indigo and country cloth.\n\nArea of Kh\u00e1ndauli tahsil, 277.3 square miles; 201 square miles being cultivated, 31 square miles cultivable, and 45.3 square miles uncultivable. Population (1872) 151,454; (1881) 141,267, namely, males 77,137, and females 64,130, the decrease of population in nine years being 10,187. Classified according to religion, the population in 1881 consisted of\u2014Hindus, 128,768; Muhammadans, 9554; Jains, 2639; and Christians, 306. Number of villages, 180, of which 90 contained less than five hundred inhabitants. Government land revenue (1881), \u00a330,987; total Government revenue, including rates and cesses, \u00a334,786; rental paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a358,002. The tahsil contains 2 criminal courts, with 4 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 56 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 331.\n\nKh\u00e1ndela.\u2014Town in the Tourw\u00e1ti district of Jaipur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Population (1881) 7949, namely, 4138 males and 3811 females. Hindus numbered 6130; Muhammadans, 1701; and \u2018others,\u2019 118.\n\nKh\u00e1ndesh.\u2014British District of the Bombay Presidency, lying between 20\u00b0 15' and 22\u00b0 5' N. lat., and between 73\u00b0 37' and 76\u00b0 24' E. long. Bounded on the north by the S\u00e1tpura hills and the Narbad\u00e1 river; on the east by Ber\u00e1r, and the Nim\u00e1r District of the Central Provinces; on the south by the S\u00e1tm\u00e1la or Ajanta hills; on the south-west by the District of N\u00e1sik; and on the west by Baroda territory and the petty State of Sag\u00e1b\u00e1ra. The District is distributed into the following sixteen Sub-divisions, each of which see separately:\u2014Amalner, Bhusawal, Ch\u00e1lisaon, Chopda, Dhulia, Erandol, Jamner, Nandurb\u00e1r, Nasirabad, Pachora, Pimpalner, Savda, Shahada, Sherpur, Taloda, and Virdeh. Area, 9944 square miles. Population (1881) 1,237,231. Chief town, Dhulia.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Kh\u00e1ndesh forms the most northerly section of the Deccan table-land. The chief natural feature is the river T\u00e1pti, which, entering at the south-east corner of the District, flows in a north-westerly direction, dividing it into two unequal parts. Of these, the larger lies towards the south, and is drained by the river Girna. Here is the long central plain of Kh\u00e1ndesh,\u2014an unbroken stretch of 150 miles, from Burh\u00e1npur to Nandurb\u00e1r, comprising an extensive area of rich alluvial soil. In this tract large and prosperous towns and villages, surrounded by mango groves and gardens, are numerous. Except when blasted by the hot winds of the dry season, the fields are green with a harvest of various crops. Northwards beyond the alluvial plain the land rises towards the S\u00e1tpura Hills. In the centre and east, save for some low ranges of barren hills, the country is level,\nand has in general an arid, unfertile appearance. Towards the north and west, the plain rises into a difficult and rugged country, thickly wooded, and inhabited by tribes of Bhils, who chiefly live on the wild fruits of the forest, and are supported by the profits of wood-cutting. The drainage of the District, drawn from an area of about 30,000 square miles, centres in the T\u00e1pti, which receives thirteen principal tributaries in its winding course of 450 miles through Kh\u00e1ndesh. None of the rivers are navigable, and the T\u00e1pti flows in too deep a bed to be made use of for irrigation. The banks of the T\u00e1pti rise high and bare at distances of from 240 to 400 yards across. Except for two waterfalls, one above and the other below the Bhus\u00e1wal railway bridge, the river rolls over long sandy stretches for 40 miles, till it meets the waters of the V\u00e1ghar. During the rainy season the T\u00e1pti is not fordable; the only bridge across it is the railway bridge at Bhus\u00e1wal.\n\nKh\u00e1ndesh District on the whole may be said to be fairly well supplied with surface water, for besides the rivers that flow during the whole year, the channels of many of the smaller streams are seldom entirely without water. In 1879-80, 28,137 wells and 97 water-lifts were utilized for irrigation. Three lakes have been built or restored for the same purpose. The four principal mountain ranges are\u2014in the north, the S\u00e1tpura hills, dividing the valleys of the T\u00e1pti and the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), including the peak of Panchu-P\u00e1ndu (3000 feet) and plateau of Turanm\u00e1l (3800 feet), the starting-point of Kh\u00e1ndesh history; in the south-east, the Hati; in the south, the S\u00e1tm\u00e1la Ch\u00e1ndor, or Ajanta range, separating Kh\u00e1ndesh from the Deccan table-land, and, speaking roughly, from the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s dominions; on the west, between Kh\u00e1ndesh and Gujar\u00e1t, is the northern extremity of the Sahy\u00e1dri range. The S\u00e1tm\u00e1la range is dotted with the remains of rock-cut Bhuddist monasteries and temples. The only cart road across the Sahy\u00e1dris, between Kh\u00e1ndesh and the Konk\u00e1n, is through the Kundaib\u00e1ri Pass, 15 miles west of Niz\u00e1mpur. The Arva and G\u00e1lna hills divide Kh\u00e1ndesh from N\u00e1sik.\n\nKh\u00e1ndesh is not rich in minerals. A large area is under forest; but the want of conservancy rules in the past, and the destructive habits of the hill tribes have robbed the jungles of most of their valuable timber. The forest revenue for the year 1881\u201382 amounted to \u00a314,200.\n\nWild beasts are numerous, comprising the tiger, leopard, hunting chita, bear, lynx, wolf, bison, s\u00e1mbhar deer, nilg\u00e1i, spotted deer, antelope, ravine deer, and the four-horned deer. At the time of the introduction of British rule, and for many years after, tigers and leopards were found in every part of the District. As late as 1858, tigers were numerous; but since then they have been very closely hunted, and during the fifteen years ending 1881 as many as 202\nwere killed. This, together with the spread of tillage, has driven the tiger almost entirely out of the plains into the S\u00e1tpura hills in the north, the Hati and S\u00e1tm\u00e1la ranges in the south-east and south, and the rough hilly country in the west.\n\n**Geology.**\u2014The geology of the District has been examined only as far south as the river T\u00e1pti. Alluvium and trap are the predominant formations, the latter in the mountain ranges and hill-spurs. Near Burh\u00e1npur is a curious patch of limestone formation of an infratrapean character, and probably included in some ancient lava flow. South of the T\u00e1pti, the peaks of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds take a strangely-tilted shape, with precipitous and long defiles between. A columnar structure of the rocks characterizes the ranges between Kh\u00e1ndesh and N\u00e1sik. Here the hills are covered with a stratum of dark basalt; and traces are obvious of felspar, hornblende, and iron-ore. There is plenty of stone for building purposes in the District, as well as gravel for road-making. A good quarry near Bhus\u00e1wal supplies the railway requirements. **Kankar**, or nodular limestone, and clay for brick-making, occur in all parts of the area.\n\n**History.**\u2014The history of Kh\u00e1ndesh, like the history of the greater part of India, falls naturally into an earlier and a later period. The early period is the period of the Hindu, the latter the period of the Muhammadan dynasties. In the case of Kh\u00e1ndesh, the early and partly mythical period extends from 150 B.C., the date of the oldest rock inscription yet discovered and deciphered, to the year 1295 A.D., when the Musalm\u00e1n emperor Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn suddenly appeared from Delhi. The later and purely historical period extends from 1295 to the present time. In its course, Kh\u00e1ndesh has been successively ruled by Muhammadan, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1, and British masters.\n\nThe annals of the Hindu period may be said to commence with the mention in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1r\u00e1ta of the hill forts of Turanm\u00e1l and Asirgarh; the ruler of Turanm\u00e1l is recorded as having fought against the P\u00e1ndyas; the fort of Asirgarh is named as a place of worship to Ashvatth\u00e1ma. Next, there is the local tradition that, from a time long previous to Christianity, the dynasty in power was that of a R\u00e1jput chief whose ancestors had come out of Oudh. The first dynasty of which distinct record remains is that of the Andrabhity\u00e1s; the Andrabhity\u00e1s were succeeded by S\u00e1h kings; in the 5th century after Christ the Ch\u00e1lukya dynasties rose to power; local chiefs followed; and Kh\u00e1ndesh was under an officer of the Yad\u00e1va princes of Devag\u00edri (Devagarh) when Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn appeared.\n\nThe Muhammadan rule lasted until the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s captured the stronghold of Asirgarh in 1760. In the interval, Kh\u00e1ndesh was subject to successive governors from Delhi, sent by the different dynasties that rose, each on the ruins of its predecessor in that city.\nUnder Tughlak, from 1323 to 1370, Kh\u00e1ndesh was administered from Ellichpur in Ber\u00e1r. Arab viceroys, favourites of the Delhi Emperor, succeeded; and from 1370 to 1600 the Arab dynasty of the Farukhis administered the District. The last year of the century (1599) saw the coming of the M\u00faghals. In that year Akbar in person overran Kh\u00e1ndesh at the head of an army, besieged Asirgarh, captured the fortress, and sent the reigning prince, Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, to Gwalior for safe-keeping. Kh\u00e1ndesh became incorporated into the Delhi Empire. Its name was changed for a time to D\u00e1ndesh in honour of its new governor, Prince D\u00e1ny\u00e1l. And from this period, a formerly rich, prosperous, and contented region began to grow impoverished and distracted.\n\nKh\u00e1ndesh under the M\u00faghals (1600\u20131760) was for more than a century and a half given up to every species of calamity, internal and external. Before the arrival of Akbar, all descriptions agree in representing it to have thriven wonderfully. Its thirty-nine sub-divisions supplied a revenue of over \u00a3200,000, and were able to furnish a contingent of 6000 infantry and 500 cavalry. The air was delightful, the winter temperate, the rivers and streams abundant. The land was highly cultivated. The husbandmen were dutiful subjects as well as laborious and thrifty workers. In many places the soil yielded three crops yearly. There was in the towns and villages a busy cloth manufacture. In one of its crowded cities\u2014Burh\u00e1npur\u2014were congregated inhabitants of all nations and of every handicraft. Then the rule of the M\u00faghals was set up. The M\u00faghal governors could not be held responsible for such natural changes as the years must bring; but as to the degenerate condition of Kh\u00e1ndesh and its people under the M\u00faghals, the following picture is extant:\u2014'In 1609, the English merchant Hawkins, travelling from Surat to Burh\u00e1npur, even with an escort of about 60 Path\u00e1n horse, was attacked by a troop of outlaws. Next year, the Viceroy was defeated by the people of the Deccan, and the country was disturbed. The roads were not safe for bodies of less than 1000 horse. The Deccanis made inroads to the T\u00e1pti, plundering the people and sacking R\u00e1ver and other towns. Ten years later (1618) Sir Thomas Roe found the country quite as unsettled. Travellers, when they stopped for the night, made a ring-fence of their carts and pitched their tents inside. On any suspicion of danger, the local governor provided a special guard of horse.'\n\nIn 1630, Kh\u00e1ndesh suffered from both war and famine. One army after another sent from Delhi, at times with the Emperor (Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n) in command, laid the country waste. The chiefs rose in revolt. After the rains the governor of Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t) let loose a force of 26,000 men to ravage the country and sack the towns. The rains proved deficient over the country between Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d and\nDaulat\u00e1b\u00e1d. Areas, before famous for fertility, became utterly barren. 'Life,' says the chronicler, 'was offered for a loaf, but none would buy; rank for a cake, but none cared for it; the ever-bounteous hand was stretched out to beg, and the rich wandered in search of food. Dogs' flesh was sold, and the pounded bones of the dead were mixed with flour. The flesh of a son was preferred to his love. The dying blocked the roads, and those who survived fled.' From 1634 to 1670 there was an interval of relief. Todar Mal's revenue system was introduced into the District, to the greater security of the r\u00e1y\u00e1l's tenure and the State revenue. The land was measured, the produce of each bigh\u00e1 ascertained, and the proportion to be paid for each field to Government settled. Trade began to increase over the Kh\u00e1ndesh roads, on its way to the emporium of Surat. The ways were safely guarded, the towns and villages made secure. Cotton, rice, and indigo were largely grown. Burh\u00e1npur again rose into importance as a cloth mart.\n\nBut in 1670 began the M\u00faghal contests with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 hordes, which were to end by dragging the District back to a condition worse than that before its temporary prosperity. The struggles between the M\u00faghals and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s practically ended with the fall of Asirgarh in 1760, and the cession of Kh\u00e1ndesh to the descendants of Siv\u00e1j\u00ed. The period of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 supremacy in Kh\u00e1ndesh lasted till the fall of the Peshw\u00e1 in 1818. Until that year Kh\u00e1ndesh experienced a return of most of its former miseries.\n\nIn 1802, the country was ravaged by Holkar's army. For two seasons the land remained uncared for, the destruction and ruin bringing on a severe famine. In the years that followed, Kh\u00e1ndesh was further impoverished by the greed and misrule of the Peshw\u00e1s. The people leaving their peaceful callings, joined together in bands, wandering over the country, robbing and laying waste. It was in this state that, in 1818, the District passed into British hands. Order was soon established, and has never since been disturbed.\n\nPopulation.\u2014In 1872, the population numbered 1,030,036. The Census returns of 1881 disclosed a total of 1,237,231 persons, residing in 23 towns and 2660 villages; average density, 124.4 persons per square mile; houses per square mile, 28; persons per village, 389; persons per house, 5.9. There has thus been an increase of 207,195, or 20 per cent., in the nine years since 1872. The increase is mainly due to immigration, arising from the large area of unoccupied fertile land available for cultivation. Classified according to sex, there were, in 1881, 632,468 males and 604,763 females; proportion of males, 51 per cent. Classified according to age, there were, under 15 years\u2014261,174 boys and 250,736 girls; total children, 511,910, or 41 per cent. of the population. Classified according\nto religion, there were 958,128 Hindus, 92,297 Muhammadans, 158 P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 1146 Christians, 88 Jews, 43 Sikhs, 10,013 Jains, 175,349 Bh\u00edls, 8 Buddhists, and 'others,' 1. Among the Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans numbered 40,459; R\u00e1jputs, 45,869; Cham\u00e1rs, 16,259; Darj\u00eds (tailors), 14,220; Dh\u00e1ngars, 27,743; Dhab\u00eds (washermen), 6564; N\u00e1pits (barbers), 16,902; Kunb\u00eds (cultivators), 337,816; Kol\u00eds, 48,307; Kumbh\u00e1rs (potters), 7041; Loh\u00e1rs (blacksmiths), 7140; M\u00e1l\u00eds (gardeners), 49,153; Son\u00e1rs (goldsmiths), 20,102; S\u00fat\u00e1rs (carpenters), 13,000; Tel\u00eds (oil-men), 23,178; B\u00e1njaras (carriers), 28,579; Mh\u00e1rs, 85,674. Other Hindus, 170,122.\n\nOf the thirteen divisions of Br\u00e1hmans in the District, three understand but do not speak Mar\u00e1th\u00ed; the remaining nine use that dialect. As a rule, the main divisions eat together, but do not intermarry; the sub-divisions as a rule do both. The entire body of Br\u00e1hmans are the descendants of Br\u00e1hmans from every part of India who found their way to Kh\u00e1ndesh. The Prabhus, a section of the 'writer' class, are scattered over the District, most of them in the service of Government. The sub-division of 'writers' called Th\u00e1k\u00fars, who come from Upper India, follow some peculiar customs. They never marry their sons and daughters into the same sub-division. If possible, the daughter marries into a higher, the son, perhaps, into a lower one.\n\nBesides the general body of cultivators, who are Kunb\u00eds by caste, large numbers of P\u00e1rdh\u00eds\u2014a low caste of wandering hunters and snarers\u2014and R\u00e1jputs have long been settled in the District. Another class of cultivators worthy of notice are the G\u00fajars, the most industrious and well-to-do of the agricultural population. Their name, and their habit of speaking Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed among themselves, show that they are immigrants from Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t. But they must have lived for many years in Kh\u00e1ndesh, as in many villages they hold hereditary grants of money and land. Most of the traders are foreigners\u2014Baniy\u00e1s from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t, and Bh\u00e1ti\u00e1s, recent comers from Bombay. Wandering and aboriginal tribes form a large section of the population. The Bh\u00edls, with a total strength of 175,349, or 14 per cent. of the whole, are the most important. Many of them are employed in police duties, and as village watchmen. But though most have settled down to peaceable ways, they show little skill in farming. Since the introduction of British rule into Kh\u00e1ndesh, the efforts made, by kindly treatment and the offer of suitable employment, to win the Bh\u00edls from a disorderly life have been most successful.\n\nThe Musalm\u00e1n Bh\u00edls are of two classes, namely, Tadv\u00eds and Nirdh\u00eds. The Tadv\u00eds, who live chiefly in the villages at the foot of the S\u00e1tpura hills, are a tall and well-built race, said to be descendants of Bhil women and Musalm\u00e1n men, dating from the Emperor Aurangzeb's reign. Like other Hindu converts to Muhammadanism, they have a\ndeep regard for certain Hindu deities. The Nirdh\u00eds dwell along the foot of the S\u00e1tm\u00e1l\u00e1s. In former times they were much dreaded; during seasons of revolt the most atrocious acts were invariably the work of the Nirdh\u00eds. Banj\u00e1ras or Lam\u00e1nis, the pack-bullock carriers of former, and the gipsies of present times, have suffered much by the increased use of carts and by the introduction of the railway. A few are well-to-do traders. But most of them live apart from the villages, in bands or t\u00e1nd\u00e1s, each with its own leader or n\u00e1ik. Forced to give up their old employment, they now live chiefly by grazing, and cutting grass and wood. The Musalm\u00e1n section of the population is poor, and employed chiefly as messengers, policemen, and day-labourers.\n\nThe Census divides the male population into the following six main groups as regards occupation:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every kind and the learned professions, 19,636; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 4595; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 7276; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 273,640; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 61,342; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 265,979.\n\nOf the 2683 towns and villages in the District, in 1881, 1133 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 931 from two to five hundred; 379 from five hundred to a thousand; 169 from one to two thousand; 27 from two to three thousand; 23 from three to five thousand; 15 from five to ten thousand; 5 from ten to fifteen thousand; and 1 from fifteen to twenty thousand.\n\nLanguage.\u2014Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed is in use among the higher class husbandmen to the north of the T\u00e1pti, and it is the language of trade throughout the District; but Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, the speech of the people in the south and west, is the language of Government offices and schools, and is gradually gaining ground. In their homes the bulk of the people speak a dialect known as Kh\u00e1ndesh\u00ed or Ahir\u00e1n\u00ed, a mixture of Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed, Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, Nem\u00e1d\u00ed, and Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014In 1881, agriculture supported 820,127 persons, or 66 per cent. of the entire population. All varieties of soil\u2014black, red, and light, from the richest to the poorest\u2014are found. The agricultural stock in State villages amounted in 1881-82 to 113,187 ploughs, 75,501 carts, 369,782 bullocks, 284,295 cows, 131,244 buffaloes, 15,949 horses, 252,744 sheep and goats, and 8705 asses. The District contains many fine cows and bullocks, brought chiefly from Nim\u00e1r and Ber\u00e1r. But the greater number of the cattle are small and poor, reduced during the hot season to the most wretched condition. The horses also are small, and of little value. To improve the breed, Government has introduced\nbulls and stud horses. Certain tracts have, from their rugged character and unhealthy climate, been excluded from the Survey operations. Out of 3,455,122 acres, the total area of Government cultivable land, 2,861,910 acres, or 82.83 per cent., were taken up for cultivation in 1881-82. Of these, 179,962 acres, or 6.29 per cent., were fallow or under grass. Of the remaining 2,681,947 acres under actual cultivation (3478 acres of which were twice cropped), grain crops occupied 1,515,346 acres, or 56.5 per cent.; pulses occupied 117,286, or 4.37 per cent.; oil-seeds occupied 247,390, or 9.22 per cent.; fibres occupied 759,346, or 28.31 per cent., of which 758,134 acres were under cotton; and miscellaneous crops occupied 46,057 acres, or 1.71 per cent.\n\nIrrigation is more extensively practised in Kh\u00e1ndesh than in the Deccan and Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 country. The principal agricultural products exported are wheat, gram, linseed, sesamum, and cotton. Millet is retained for local consumption, and forms the staple article of food. Indigo and opium, once important products, are now no longer grown. Thirty years ago, the poppy was a favourite crop; but in 1853, the Kh\u00e1ndesh opium factory was closed, and the further cultivation of the poppy forbidden. On the other hand, the area under linseed and cotton has increased from year to year. Two descriptions of foreign cotton, Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Hingangh\u00e1t, have been successfully introduced. Cotton is seldom grown oftener than once in three years in the same field, whether of black or light soil, the intermediate crops being wheat and Indian millet. A Government farm has been established at Bhadg\u00e1on. Almost every year is marked by some partial failure of the crops. The District is liable to floods, the rivers overflowing the country for a considerable distance from their banks.\n\nAttempts at Land Reclamation.\u2014Several attempts have been made, dating from 1829, at a re-colonization of the Pal tappa, a waste tract in the neighbourhood of the S\u00e1tpura hills, which is said to have been formerly well inhabited. At the time of the British occupation in 1818, the whole was found to be an uninhabited jungle, excessively unhealthy, and infested with wild beasts. It is said to have been deserted about the middle of the 17th century, owing to famine; and the remains of ancient buildings show that the village of Pal was formerly a place of considerable importance. Portions of the old fort and sar\u00e1i are still standing, though much ruined; a handsome mosque with a fountain and reservoir still remain in good repair; and the lines of the old streets were traceable in 1870. Small mounds here and there mark the site of an old fort; but most of the villages have so entirely disappeared that their sites cannot be ascertained. Several attempts have been made to colonize Pal, or some other village in the tappa, as a preliminary to the settlement of the whole tract. The experiment is still (1885) going on, but as yet, owing to the excessive\npoverty of the cultivators and other causes, it has yielded little or no results.\n\n**Industries.**\u2014The Trunk Road from Bombay to Agra passes through the District, and of late years roads have been made along all the chief lines of traffic. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway runs for 124 miles through the District from east to west; Bhus\u00e1wal junction is situated on this portion of the line; and about 25 miles of the N\u00e1gpur branch are within the District. The chief exports are food-grains, oil-seeds, butter, indigo, wax, and honey. The chief imports\u2014salt, spices, metal, piece-goods, yarn, and sugar. The most important article of trade is cotton. There are 2 steam cotton ginning factories, 13 steam presses, and one steam factory for spinning and weaving cotton. Of late years, many Bombay mercantile houses have established agencies in Kh\u00e1ndesh; and towards the east, in the rich T\u00e1pti valley, Jalg\u00e1on and Bhus\u00e1wal are rising into centres of an important trade.\n\nAmong declining industries may be noticed the manufacture of coarse paper, the spinning of yarn by Mh\u00e1r women, the weaving of coarse cotton cloth, and the manufacture of wax bangles.\n\nThe internal trade is carried on by means of weekly markets, and a succession of fairs and religious feasts. The rates of interest vary from 9 to 24 per cent. per annum, rising in some cases as high as 36 per cent. Labourers earn 4\u00bdd. a day; bricklayers and carpenters, 1s. The current prices of the chief articles of food during 1882 were, for a rupee (2s.)\u2014wheat, 34 lbs.; jo\u00e1r, 54 lbs.; rice, 22 lbs.; d\u00e1l (split peas), 22 lbs.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014The T\u00e1pti and lesser streams are liable to sudden and disastrous rising of their waters. Six great floods have caused more or less injury at various periods in the District. These floods took place in 1822, 1829, 1837, 1872, 1875, and in 1876. In 1822, sixty-five villages were entirely destroyed by the T\u00e1pti, and fifty were partly washed away, causing a loss in money value of \u00a325,000. On Sunday, 15th September 1872, the Girna and P\u00e1njhra rose and swept away 500 houses in the town of Dh\u00fali\u00e1. A whole village on the opposite side of the P\u00e1njhra suddenly disappeared. At seven in the morning the flood was forty-five feet above the level of the river-bed. One hundred and fifty-two villages were damaged, and property to the value of \u00a3160,000 destroyed. Over 1000 persons were on this occasion relieved by public and private charity. The most severe famine on record is that of 1802\u201304, when the selling price of grain is reported to have risen to 1 ser per rupee (1s. per lb.). Great numbers died, and extensive tracts were left deserted and waste. This famine was due, not to any natural causes, but to the ravages of Holkar's army, who during two years (1802\u201303) spread desolation and famine\nthroughout the District. Scarcities not amounting to famine occurred in 1824, 1833-36, 1845, and 1876-77. Locusts have sometimes visited the District, but never in sufficient numbers to do much harm. In 1869, a large cloud crossed the District from north to south, and in 1873 and in 1878 they did some injury to the late crop. Rats in 1847-48 and 1878-79 caused much havoc.\n\nAdministration.\u2014For administrative purposes the District is distributed into 16 Sub-divisions. The total revenue raised in 1881-82 under all heads\u2014imperial, local, and municipal\u2014amounted to \u00a3507,320, showing an incidence of taxation of 8s. 2\u00bdd. per head. The land-tax forms the principal source of revenue, amounting to \u00a3352,564. Other important items are stamps and excise. The District local funds, created since 1863, for works of public utility and rural education, yielded a total sum of \u00a333,132. There are 18 municipalities, containing an aggregate population of 148,084 persons; total municipal revenue, \u00a310,159, the incidence of taxation varying from 4d. to 3s. 7d. per head. The administration of the District in revenue matters is entrusted to a Collector and 5 Assistants, of whom 4 are covenanted civilians. For the settlement of civil disputes, there are 10 courts; the number of suits decided in 1881-82 was 18,832. The total strength of the regular police for the protection of person and property consisted of 1845 officers and men, being 1 policeman to every 670 of the population. The total cost was \u00a327,744, equal to \u00a32, 15s. 9\u00bdd. per square mile of area and 5\u00bdd. per head of population. The number of persons convicted of any offence, great or small, was 3551, being 1 to every 348 of the population. Education has widely spread of late years. In 1855-56 there were only 7 schools, attended by 715 pupils. In 1881-82 there were 352 schools, attended by 20,815 pupils, being an average of 1 school for every 7\u00bd villages. There are 3 libraries and 3 printing presses for the publication of vernacular papers, which have, however, only a small circulation.\n\nClimate.\u2014The rainy period extends from the middle of June to the middle of October; the cold months from the middle of October to the middle of January; and the hot months from January to June. From differences of elevation the climate varies greatly in different parts of the District. Very seldom is the rainfall over the whole area sufficient. The town of Dh\u00fali\u00e1, which may be taken to illustrate the average, had an annual rainfall of 21.7 inches during the period of twenty-nine years ending in 1879. The amount varied during these years from 10 to 35 inches. The average rainfall during the five years ending 1882 was 27 inches. In the cold season (October to January), except on cloudy days, the climate is pleasant and bracing. At Dh\u00fali\u00e1 the average minimum between 1871 and 1879 ranged between 40\u00b0 F. and 52\u00b0. The heat of the summer period is intense. The\naverage maximum reading at Dh\u00fal\u00ed\u00e1 during the 1871-79 period was 156\u00b0 for the month of May. The extreme maximum was as high as 111\u00b0. In the T\u00e1pti valley 115\u00b0 has been reached during a hot and stifling night.\n\nThe general health of the people is best in the hot season, and worst in the cold season. Malaria is rife at the beginning of the latter season, when the ground commences to dry after the rains. In the east and centre, the climate is trying to Europeans, but healthy to the natives. In the west, all periods except the hot are injurious to native and European alike. The prevailing diseases are fever and skin affections. Seven dispensaries afforded medical relief, in 1881-82, to 67 in-door and 29,044 out-door patients, and 38,510 persons were vaccinated. Since 1881-82, three new dispensaries have been opened.

Lat. 20\u00b0 16' N., long. 85\u00b0 50' E. Twin sandstone hills, Khandgiri and Ud\u00e1yagiri, rise abruptly out of the jungle, separated by a narrow gorge, each of which is honeycombed into caves and temples cut out of the rock. These cave dwellings are believed to form the very earliest memorials of Buddhism in India. They are of various ages, and of different degrees of architecture. The oldest of them consist of a single cell, little larger than a dog-kennel, cut in the face of scarcely accessible precipices, and with no signs of even the primitive carpentry architecture. Others of a somewhat later date are shaped into strangely distorted resemblances of animals. One has from time immemorial been known as the Snake Cave, another as the Elephant Cave, a third as the Tiger Cave. This last stands out from the rock in the form of a monstrous wild beast's jaw, with nose and eyes above, and teeth overhanging the entrance to the cell. Such cells in their turn give way to more comfortable excavations, shaded by pillared verandahs, and lighted by several doors, which again are succeeded by others still more elaborate. Of the last, the most important is a two-storied monastery, known as the R\u00e1n\u00ed-n\u00far or Queen's Palace, highly sculptured in bas-relief. These sandstone caves, as a whole, represent ten centuries of human existence, or from 500 B.C. to 500 A.D. The oldest are on UDAYAGIRI HILL, the more modern ones being on KHANDGIRI, whose summit is crowned by a Jain temple erected by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s at the end of the last century.\nKhandgosh.\u2014Village and head-quarters of a police circle (th\u00e1nd) in the head-quarters Sub-division of Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal; situated on the road from Bardw\u00e1n town to Son\u00e1mukh\u00ed and B\u00e1nkur\u00e1. Lat. 23\u00b0 12' 30\" N., long. 87\u00b0 44' 20\" E.\n\nKh\u00e1ndia.\u2014Petty State in the Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village, with 2 separate proprietors. Area, 5 square miles. Population (1872) 966; (1881) 781. Estimated revenue in 1881, \u00a3294; tribute of \u00a380, 13s. is paid to the British Government, \u00a38, 2s. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh, and \u00a31, 6s. as sukhr\u00ed on account of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. Kh\u00e1ndia village is situated about four miles to the north-east of Bhoika th\u00e1nd, and eight miles south-east of the Limbdi station on the Bhaunagar-Gondal Railway.\n\nKhandp\u00e1r\u00e1.\u2014Native State in Orissa, lying between lat. 20\u00b0 11' 15\" and 20\u00b0 25' N., and long. 85\u00b0 1' and 85\u00b0 24' 40\" E. Bounded on the north by the Mah\u00e1nadi river, which separates it from Narsinghpur and Baramba; on the east by B\u00e1nki and Pur\u00ed District; on the south by Pur\u00ed and Nay\u00e1garh; and on the west by Daspall\u00e1. The State originally formed part of Nay\u00e1garh, and was separated from it about 200 years ago by a brother of the Nay\u00e1garh R\u00e1j\u00e1, who established his independence. The present chief, a R\u00e1jput by caste, is the eighth in descent from the founder. The country forms a very valuable territory, and is one of the best cultivated of the Orissa States. Fine s\u00e1l timber abounds in the hilly tracts, and magnificent banian and mango trees stud the plain. It is intersected by the Kuari\u00e1 and Dauka rivers, small tributaries of the Mah\u00e1nadi.\n\nArea, 244 square miles, with 321 villages and 12,946 houses. The first Census of 1872 thus returned the population, according to religion\u2014Hindus, 57,007, or 93\u00b76 per cent.; Muhammadans, 38, or 1 per cent.; 'others,' 3832, or 6\u00b73 per cent.; total, 60,877, namely, males 30,234, and females 30,643. Classified according to race, there were, in 1872\u2014aboriginal tribes, 3561, or 5\u00b79 per cent., mainly composed of Kandhs (1596) and Savars (1126); semi-Hinduized aborigines, 6438, or 10\u00b76 per cent., consisting principally of P\u00e1ns (3577), Meht\u00e1rs (1547), and Kand\u00e1ras (1064); Hindu castes, 50,840, or 83\u00b75 per cent.; Muhammadans, 38.\n\nThe more recent Census of 1881 followed a different classification, and only returned the population according to religion. In that year the population numbered 66,296, namely, males 33,891, and females 32,405, showing an increase of 5419, or 8\u00b78 per cent. in nine years. In religion the people are almost entirely Hindus, that faith being professed by 66,196 persons, while only 60 were returned as Muhammadans, and 40 as belonging to aboriginal religions. The principal seat of trade is K\u00e1ntilo, on the banks of the Mah\u00e1nadi, lat. 20\u00b0 21' 46\" N., long. 85\u00b0 14' 20\" E. Popula-\ntion (1872) 5386. Not returned in the Census of 1881. Five other villages also contained upwards of 100 houses in 1872, namely, Khandp\u00e1ra, the capital of the State, and residence of the R\u00e1ja, lat. 20\u00b0 15' 50\" N., long. 85\u00b0 12' 51\" E., 680 houses. Khandp\u00e1ra had risen to the highest place as regards population by 1881, in which year it contained 5543 inhabitants, namely, Hindus, 5529, and Muhammadans, 14. Biengoni\u00e1, lat. 20\u00b0 15' 8\" N., long. 85\u00b0 16' E., 211 houses; Fatehgarh, lat. 20\u00b0 17' 37\" N., long. 85\u00b0 22' 32\" E., 158 houses; Banmalipur, lat. 20\u00b0 16' 14\" N., long. 85\u00b0 15' 12' E., 130 houses; Nem\u00e1pol, lat. 20\u00b0 16' 10\" N., long. 85\u00b0 16' 14\" E. Estimated annual revenue of the chief, \u00a32435; tribute, \u00a3421. A post-office has recently been established at Kantilo, and increased means of communication have been afforded by the construction of good metalled roads.\n\nKhandtarn.\u2014Town in Champ\u00e1ran District, Bengal. Lat. 26\u00b0 40' 15\" N., long. 85\u00b0 5' 45\" E. Population (1872) 6207. Not separately returned in the Census of 1881.\n\nKhandw\u00e1.\u2014The eastern tahsil or revenue Sub-division of Nim\u00e1r District, Central Provinces; situated between 21\u00b0 32' and 22\u00b0 13' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 6' 30\" and 77\u00b0 1' E. long. Area (1881), 2202 square miles; number of towns and villages, 497; houses, 32,009. Population in 1872, but according to the area of 1881, 138,922. Population in 1881, 154,000, namely, males 80,842, and females 73,158, showing an increase of 15,078 in nine years. Average density of population, 70 persons per square mile. The adult agricultural population (male and female) numbered 61,689, or 40\u00b706 per cent. of that of the whole tahsil, the average area of cultivated and cultivable land being 11 acres for each adult agriculturist. Of the total area of 2202 square miles, less than one-half, or 1066 square miles, is assessed for Government revenue. Of this area, 482 square miles were returned as cultivated in 1881, 372 square miles as still available for cultivation, and 212 square miles as uncultivable waste. Total Government revenue (1881), including local rates and cesses, \u00a312,021, or an average of 9\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated land. Total rental paid by cultivators, including rates and cesses, \u00a326,155, or an average of 1s. 7\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total number of civil courts (including those at headquarters for the entire District, and the Cantonment Magistrate's court at Asirgarh), 6; criminal courts, 9; number of police stations (including outposts), 18; strength of regular police force, 135 men, besides village police (chaukid\u00e1rs).\n\nKhandw\u00e1.\u2014Head-quarters and civil station of Nim\u00e1r District, Central Provinces. Lat. 21\u00b0 50' N., long. 76\u00b0 23' E. Khandw\u00e1 is perhaps the most advancing town in the Central Provinces. It has a station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, where the whole traffic of Central India towards Bombay meets the line. Thus it has entirely\nsuperseded Burhanpur, the ancient centre of trade between M\u00e1lw\u00e1, the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) valley, and the Deccan. Population (1877) 14,119; (1881) 15,142, namely, males 8472, and females 6670. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 10,321; Muhammadans, 3851; Christians, 568; Jains, 264; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 90; Jews, 26; Satn\u00e1m\u00ed, 1; aboriginal religions, 21. Municipal income (1882\u201383), \u00a33440, of which \u00a32386 was derived from taxation, nearly all from octroi duties; average incidence of taxation, 3s. 1\u00bdd. per head. Extensive barracks have been built for the relays of troops who pass through in the cold season, and also a good travellers\u2019 bungalow with a spacious sar\u00e1\u00ed or native rest-house, near the railway station.\n\nThe Arab geographer, Al Bir\u00fan\u00ed (circa 1000 A.D.), mentions Khandw\u00e1; and a century later, it was a great seat of Jain worship. The mound on which the town stands has supplied many finely carved pillars, cornices, and other remains of the old Jain buildings, which have been built into Br\u00e1hmanical temples, the walls of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 fort, and other structures, besides forming materials for the Sivaite temples surrounding the four kunds or water reservoirs, one of which is on each side of the town, that on the west side bearing the date A.D. 1132. Ferishta describes Khandw\u00e1 as the seat of a local governor of the Ghor\u00ed kingdom of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 in 1516. The town was burnt by Jaswant R\u00e1o Holkar in 1802, and again partially by T\u00e1nti\u00e1 Top\u00ed in 1858. The civil station, 2 miles east of the town, contains a court-house, circuit-house, and church. The road to Indore is in good repair.\n\nKh\u00e1ngarh.\u2014Town and municipality in Muzaffargarh t\u00e1sil, Muzaffargarh District, Punjab; situated about 4 miles from the present bed of the Chen\u00e1b, and 11 miles south of Muzaffargarh town. Lat. 29\u00b0 55\u2032 N., long. 71\u00b0 12\u2032 E. Kh\u00e1ngarh is the head-quarters of a police division (th\u00e1n\u00e1), and was chosen in 1849 as the civil station of the District; it was found, however, liable to inundation from the Chen\u00e1b, and in 1859 the head-quarters were removed to Muzaffargarh. Population (1868) 3717; (1881) 3417, namely, Hindus, 1909; Muhammadans, 1504; Jains, 3; Sikh, 1. Number of houses, 947. Municipal income (1875\u20131876), \u00a3377; (1881\u201382), \u00a3522; average incidence, 3s. 0\u00bdd. per head. The land around the town is well wooded, fertile, and more highly cultivated than any other part of the District. Kh\u00e1npur is little more than an ordinary village compactly built, chiefly of brick, with one principal street running north and south, from which narrow lanes branch off at right angles. The main streets and lanes are neatly paved. At the beginning of the century it was an Afgh\u00e1n post, but the town has now outgrown the dimensions of the circular fortification which originally enclosed it. It has no manufactures, and owes all the importance it possesses to being the agricultural centre for a fertile tract. The town contains a grain market, primary school, municipal hall, dis-\npensary, and sar\u00e1\u00ed or native inn. Outside the town is an encamping ground.\n\nKhani\u00e1-dh\u00e1na.\u2014One of the petty States in Bundelkhand, under the political superintendence of the Central India Agency. It originally formed part of the Orchh\u00e1 (Urch\u00e1) or Tehri State, the j\u00e1gir having been granted by Ud\u00e9t Singh to his younger brother, Am\u00e1n Singh, about the year 1703. After the dismemberment of the Orchh\u00e1 State by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the Peshw\u00e1 granted a sanad for the j\u00e1gir to Am\u00edn Singh. For a long time the claim to feudal suzerainty over Khani\u00e1-dh\u00e1na was disputed between the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 State of Jh\u00e1nsi and Orchh\u00e1. However, in 1862, when the Jh\u00e1nsi R\u00e1j was extinct, it was decided that the Khani\u00e1-dh\u00e1na j\u00e1gir was directly dependent on the British Government, as it had undoubtedly formed part of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 conquests, to which the British Government had succeeded. The chief is a Hindu B\u00fandela. The present (1883) R\u00e1j\u00e1 being a minor, the administration is conducted by his uncle. The area of the State is about 84 square miles. Population (1881) 13,494, namely, males 7089, and females 6405. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Hindus, 12,857; Jains, 480; and Muhammadans, 157. The revenue is estimated at \u00a32000 a year. The State is in a wild tract of country, with much hill and jungle, west of the Betw\u00e1 river and southwest of Orchh\u00e1.\n\nKhani\u00e1-dh\u00e1na.\u2014Chief town in Khani\u00e1-dh\u00e1na State, Bundelkhand, Central India; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 1' 30\" N., long 78\u00b0 11' 30\" E.

The country in the immediate neighbourhood is irrigated, and supports a considerable population; but the sandy desert to the south presents the usual barren appearance of the Punjab uplands. Thornton says that Kh\u00e1npur bears marks of having formerly possessed greater importance than at present. It now forms a station on the Indus Valley State Railway, 133 miles from Rohri, and 147 miles from M\u00falt\u00e1n. The town contains a flat-roofed b\u00e1z\u00e1r, and a ruined fort 200 yards long and 120 broad.\n\nKh\u00e1nua (Kh\u00e1nwa).\u2014Village in Bhartpur (Bhurtapore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; situated on the road from Agra to Ajmere, 37 miles west of the former and 197 miles east of the latter town. Lat. 27\u00b0 2' N., long. 77\u00b0 33' E. Thornton states that this village was the site of the great battle, in 1526 A.D., between the M\u00faghal conqueror B\u00e1bar and the confederated R\u00e1jput princes under R\u00e1n\u00e1 Sanka of Udaipur (Oodeypore). The latter were completely defeated; B\u00e1bar henceforth assumed the title of Gh\u00e1zi, \u2018Victorious over the Infidel,\u2019 and the supremacy of Upper India passed into the hands of the Muhammadan invaders.\n\nKh\u00e1nw\u00e1han.\u2014Village in the Kandi\u00e1rot\u00edluk, Naushahro Sub-division, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; 8 miles north-east of Kandi\u00e1ro town. The population, chiefly agriculturists, is inconsiderable. Cotton cloth is manufactured for home consumption and export. The town is supposed to have been founded some 300 years ago by one Kh\u00e1n Sahta, a zam\u00ednd\u00e1r. Head-quarters of a tappad\u00e1r.\n\nKhanwah Canal.\u2014One of the Upper Sutlej (Satlaj) Inundation Channels in Lahore and Montgomery Districts, Punjab, and one of the most important of those useful irrigation works. The canal follows the course of an ancient flood-torrent bed, with a cross cut from the Sutlej. Its origin and date remain uncertain, though tradition assigns its construction, amongst other persons, to Kh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n\u00e1n, a minister of the Emperor Akbar, who held this part of the country as a fief. In 1839, the head was reported to be choked up with sand; and in the succeeding year, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Kharrak Singh, the son and successor of the great Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranjit Singh, cleared it out by contributions levied from the surrounding landowners. Shortly afterwards,\nthe canal once more silted up, and continued inefficient till 1843, when Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Sher Singh repaired it at the expense of the State, which has since levied a half-yearly water-rate of 16s. per acre irrigated. The head-water flows from the Sutlej near M\u00e1mok\u00ed, in Lahore District, and the channel runs as far as Dhappai, 26 miles below Dip\u00e1lpur in Montgomery. Since the annexation, the Canal Department has taken charge of the works, and greatly promoted its efficiency, and much is still being done to render it useful to a larger area. The area watered by it in 1881\u201382 was 84,456 acres, and the water-rate levied amounted to \u00a310,095.\n\nKh\u00e1p\u00e1.\u2014Town and municipality in N\u00e1gpur District, Central Provinces.

It contains an area of 6157 square miles, with a population, according to the Census of 1881, of 169,360 souls. The administrative head-quarters are at the station of Shillong, which is also the residence of the Chief Commissioner of Assam, situated in $25^\\circ 32' 39'' N.$ lat., and $91^\\circ 55' 32'' E.$ long.\nThe Kh\u00e1si and Jaintia Hills form the central section of the watershed between the valleys of the Brahmaputra and the Surma. On the north the District is bounded by K\u00e1mr\u00fap and Nowgong (Naug\u00e1on); east by the Nowgong (Naug\u00e1on) and Cachar Districts; south by Sylhet; and west by the G\u00e1ro Hills. The District is divided into three portions, namely, British possessions in the Kh\u00e1si Hills; petty dependent democratic States in the Kh\u00e1si Hills, presided over by elected chiefs known as Siems, W\u00e1had\u00e1d\u00e1rs, Sard\u00e1rs, and Lyngdohs; and the Jaintia Hill country, which is entirely British territory.\n\nThe British possessions in the Kh\u00e1si and Jaintia Hills, which cover an aggregate area of 2160 square miles, consist of the following Fiscal Divisions:\u2014In the Kh\u00e1si Hills\u2014(1) Jim-mang; (2) L\u00e1it-lynkot; (3) L\u00e1it-kroh; (4) B\u00e1\u00ed-rang, otherwise W\u00e1h-long; (5) Long-k\u00e1-ding; (6) M\u00e1o-be-l\u00e1r-k\u00e1r; (7) M\u00e1o-sm\u00e1i; (8) Mynteng; (9) M\u00e1o-ml\u00fah; (10) M\u00e1o-pun-kyr-tiang; (11) Nong-j\u00edrf; (12) Nong-lyng-kin; (13) Nong-bah; (14) Nong-ri\u00e1t; (15) Nong-kroh; (16) Nun-niah; (17) R\u00e1m-d\u00e1it; (18) S\u00e1it-soh-pen; (19) Tyng-riang; (20) Tyng-rong; (21) Tyr-n\u00e1; (22) Um-niuh; (23) Mar-bisu (dependency); and (24) U Tyma.

Presided over by Langdohs\u2014(1) Lan-iong; (2) M\u00e1o-phlang; (3) Nong-lyw\u00e1i; and (4) Soh-iong.\n\nHistory.\u2014In history, as in administration, the Kh\u00e1si Hills and the Jaintia Hills constitute two separate tracts. The Kh\u00e1si Hills are occupied by a collection of States, each governed by an elective ruler, on democratic principles. The chiefs or siems have treaties or agreements with the British Government, and their territories (vide Act xxii. of 1869, section 9) are held not to be parts of British India. They resemble the petty States in the neighbourhood of Simla, and are in so-called \u2018political\u2019 relations with the District officer. Heinous offences\nare tried by him, civil cases and minor offences being decided by the courts of the States. Besides the territories of the siems, however, there are several villages in the Kh\u00e1si Hills which are purely British, acquired either by cession, conquest, or voluntary transfer of allegiance. The Jaintia Hills, on the other hand, are purely British territory, being that portion of the dominions of the Raj\u00e1 of Jaintia annexed in 1835, which it was not found convenient to incorporate with the District of Sylhet.\n\nWhen the East India Company acquired the div\u00e1n\u00ed of Bengal in 1765, Sylhet was the frontier District towards the north-east. All beyond was occupied by wild tribes, who had never acknowledged subjection to the Muhammadans. Among these the Kh\u00e1s\u00eds early attracted attention. By their language and other characteristics, they stand out in marked contrast to the various peoples by whom they are surrounded. Securely perched on the plateaux of their native hills, they have preserved a political constitution to which there is no analogy in the rest of India. But it was not to scientific inquirers that they first became an object of curiosity. They possess, on the southern slopes of their mountains, a rich abundance of natural products, which at an early date attracted European enterprise. From time immemorial, Bengal has drawn its supply of limestone, lime, and oranges from the Kh\u00e1si Hills. Potatoes, an article of export now hardly second to lime, were introduced in 1830 by the first British Agent, Mr. Scott. Coal and iron are found in many places, both of excellent quality; but the expense of transport prevents the coal from being utilized, and the greater cheapness of English iron has gradually overcome the old reputation of the Kh\u00e1s\u00eds as iron smelters.\n\nEven in the last century, the large profits to be obtained from the trade in lime, known at Calcutta by the name of 'Sylhet lime,' had brought the English officers stationed at Sylhet into contact with the Kh\u00e1s\u00eds. In 1826, the chief of Nong-khlao, one of the principal of the Kh\u00e1si States, entered into an agreement with certain European British subjects to allow a road to be made across the hills, to connect the Surm\u00e1 valley with Assam Proper. Several Europeans took up their residence at Nong-khlao. Unfortunately, misunderstandings arose, and the growing discontent was fanned into a flame by the misconduct of some of their Beng\u00e1l\u00ed followers. On the 4th April 1829, the Kh\u00e1s\u00eds rose in arms and massacred Lieutenants Bedingfield and Burlton, together with some sepoys. This led to military operations on the part of the British Government, which were protracted through several cold seasons. The last of the Kh\u00e1si chiefs did not tender his submission till 1833. From 1835 to 1854, Colonel Lister was Political Agent in the Kh\u00e1si Hills, with his head-quarters at Nong-khlao, subsequently moved to Cherra P\u00fanj\u00ed.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Jaintia Hills, who call themselves Pan\u00e1rs,\nand are called Santengs or Syntengs by the Kh\u00e1sis, have a less interesting history. They first became British subjects in 1835. In that year, the last R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jaintia, R\u00e1jendra Singh, was deposed on the charge of complicity with certain of his tribesmen who had carried off three British subjects from Nowgong District, and barbarously immolated them at a shrine of K\u00e1l\u00ed. That portion of his territory lying in the plains was incorporated with the District of Sylhet; and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 voluntarily resigned the hill portion, of which also we took possession. The indigenous revenue system was continued, consisting simply of the payment of a he-goat once a year from each village. In 1860, however, a house-tax was imposed, the highest limit of which was 1 rupee (2s.) per house. This measure of direct taxation was very obnoxious to the Santengs, and it led to outbreaks, which had to be suppressed by force.\n\nIn the following year, fresh taxation was introduced in the shape of judicial stamps, the schedules of the income-tax, and imposts upon fisheries and wood-cutting. The absence of any resident European officer, and the injudicious acts of certain subordinates, precipitated a general insurrection. In January 1862, the th\u00e1n\u00e1 or police station of Jow\u00e1i was burnt to the ground; the garrison of sepoys was besieged, and all show of British authority was quickly swept away throughout the hills. The Santengs fought bravely for their independence, and at first were successful in cutting off several small detachments of police and sepoys. Their only weapons were bows and arrows. Their defences consisted of a series of strong stockades, the pathways leading to which were thickly planted with p\u00ednjis or little bamboo spikes. At last it was found necessary to move regular troops into the country. The military operations were tedious and harassing. The rebel chiefs were captured one by one, and the District was declared to be finally pacified in March 1863, after the rebellion had lasted for fifteen months. Various measures of improvement were introduced into the administration, and the Santengs, like the Kh\u00e1sis, have ever since remained peaceable and contented.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District consists of a succession of plateaux, deeply furrowed by the action of streams, and rising in shelves from one level to another. On the southern side, towards Sylhet, the mountains rise precipitously from the valley of the Barak. The first plateau is met with at the height of about 4000 feet above sea-level. Farther north is another plateau, on which is situated the station of Shillong, 4900 feet above the sea; behind lies the Shillong range, of which the highest peak rises to 6449 feet. On the north side, towards K\u00e1mr\u00fap, are two similar plateaux of lower elevation. The general appearance of all these table-lands is that of undulating downs, covered with grass, but destitute of large timber.\nOn the whole, the Kh\u00e1si Hills are remarkable for the absence of forest. At an elevation of 3000 feet, the indigenous pine (Pinus kasia) predominates over all other vegetation, and forms almost pure pine forests. The highest peaks are clothed with magnificent clumps of timber trees, which superstition has preserved from the axe of the woodcutter. The characteristic trees in these sacred groves are those of a temperate zone, chiefly consisting of oaks, chestnuts, magnolias, etc. Beneath the shade grow rare orchids, rhododendrons, and wild cinnamon. The streams that find their way through the hills are merely mountain torrents, navigable by canoes only in their lower reaches. As they approach the plains, they form rapids and cascades, and many of them pass through narrow gorges of wild beauty.\n\nThe forests are too scanty to furnish any considerable source of revenue. The total area of 'unreserved forest,' i.e. land covered with timber trees and not at present required for j\u00fam cultivation, is only 150 square miles. Besides a small forest area in the vicinity of Shillong, 36 tracts are reserved in the Kh\u00e1si, and 21 in the Jaintia Hills. An experimental cinchona plantation was established near Nong-khlao, but has now been abandoned.\n\nThe natural wealth of the Kh\u00e1si Hills is confined to the limestone quarries along the southern slope. From time immemorial, Bengal has drawn its supply of lime from this source, and the quarries are literally inexhaustible. In 1881-82, the total export of lime was 1,598,117 maunds, valued at \u00a327,943. The revenue derived by Government was \u00a33837, and the native chiefs received in addition over \u00a3600. The quarries are chiefly situated in the beds and on the banks of rivers; and the stone is transported by water to the Surm\u00e1, where it is either at once calcined or placed in the lump upon larger vessels for shipment to Bengal.\n\nCoal of excellent quality crops out at Cherra P\u00fanj\u00ed, L\u00e1-k\u00e1-dong, Laur, and several other places; but owing to difficulty of transport and the high price of labour, these deposits have never yet been remuneratively worked. Iron-ore, in the shape of crystals of magnetic iron, is found in the decomposed granite of the central axis of the hills. These are separated from the lighter elements of the stone by the action of water, and reduced with the help of charcoal. In former days the Kh\u00e1sis were renowned as smelters of iron. Recently, however, the cheapness of the iron imported from England has almost succeeded in driving the native commodity out of the market.\n\nAmong other natural products may be mentioned beeswax, lac, and caoutchouc. Wild animals of all kinds abound, including elephants, rhinoceros, tigers, buffaloes, mithuns or wild cows, and many varieties of deer. The rivers swarm with fish; the m\u00e1hsir especially is excellent both for sport and for the table.\nNatural Phenomena.\u2014Many peculiar caves and caverns are found in the limestone rock formation, the most notable being the caves at Cherra P\u00fanj\u00ed and at R\u00fapn\u00e1th in Amwi. At the latter place the caverns extend a great distance beneath the earth, one being imagined by the people to reach as far as China, and a Hindu legend states that a Chinese army once marched by this route to the invasion of India. In another cave, the limestone stalactites have been carved into images representing the gods of the Hindu pantheon. On the banks of the Kapil\u00ed river on the Cachar border, at a place called Sumir, there is a hot spring, the water of which contains carbonate of lime.\n\nThe People.\u2014No early estimates of the population exist. In 1881, an enumeration was taken mainly through the agency of the native chiefs. The results show a total population in the Kh\u00e1si and Jaintia Hills of 169,360 persons, dwelling in 1546 villages and in 35,048 houses. These figures give an average of 27\u00b75 persons per square mile, 109 persons per village, and 4\u00b783 persons per house. Divided according to sex, there are 80,543 males and 88,817 females; proportion of males, 47\u00b755 per cent. Divided according to age, there are, under 15 years, 33,986 boys and 33,709 girls; total children, 67,695, or 39\u00b797 per cent. of the population. The religious classification of the people shows 160,976 aborigines, 5692 Hindus, 570 Muhammadans, 15 Brahmos, and 2107 Christians, including 212 Europeans and Eurasians, and 1895 native converts.\n\nAs is clearly shown by the above figures, the two races of Kh\u00e1sis and Santengs have succeeded in preserving to the present day their primitive isolation, free from the interference of Hinduism. They still maintain their indigenous forms of belief and religious worship, and repudiate alike the authority of Br\u00e1hmans and the entire system of caste. They have in the Jaintia Hills given way somewhat to Hindu prejudices so far as regards purity of food. The comparatively few Hindus to be found in the hills either belong to the regiments as soldiers and camp followers, or are attached in some capacity to the Government offices, or are private servants. Some of the local traders, too, are Hindus from other parts of India. There is no emigration, except in the case of the labourers who proceed southward every year to work on the tea-gardens in Cachar and Sylhet.\n\nThe Kh\u00e1sis occupy a position of isolation among the hill tribes by whom they are surrounded, in language, national characteristics, and political institutions. From the point of view of ethnology, they are commonly classed with the neighbouring Santengs, G\u00e1ros, N\u00e1g\u00e1s, Cacharis, etc., as a sub-division of the Indo-Chinese branch of the human family. Their physiognomy, colour, and physical appearance would place them among these tribes; but their language has no\nanalogy elsewhere in the whole of India. It has been described as 'monosyllabic in the agglutinative stage.' The greater number of the words used are monosyllabic roots; the compounds are mere juxtapositions of these roots. The Kh\u00e1sis have no written character or literature, but traditions abound. The missionaries use school-books printed in the Roman character, into which the Old and New Testaments, and several religious and other books have been transliterated. The Kh\u00e1si political organization consists of a number of petty States or democracies, presided over by elective chiefs. The Hindu village community, the hereditary R\u00e1j\u00e1 of some neighbouring States, and the military general of others, are alike unknown to them.\n\nThe most curious of their social customs is the importance attached to female descent and female authority. The husband marries into the wife's family, the wife or her mother being regarded as the head of the household. Property brought by the husband to the wife's house reverts to his own family at his death, being, together with his ashes after cremation, made over by his widow and children to the youngest sister of the deceased, who inherits all ancestral property, and property acquired previous to marriage. Property acquired during wedlock goes at the death of the husband to the widow and children, but this custom varies in different parts of the country, the inhabitants of the southern slopes and valleys recognising no difference between property acquired previous to or after marriage. Children here inherit all property. If there are no children, the property goes, on the death of the husband, to the nearest of kin who performed the funeral obsequies. Relatives who do not join in the performance of such ceremonies do not share. If the children are minors, and incapable of performing the funeral ceremonies, the property becomes temporarily alienated to the relatives who perform the same, but passes to the children when grown up, on payment of the expenses incurred by the relatives.\n\nThe Kh\u00e1sis still maintain their aboriginal forms of belief, and repudiate alike the authority of Br\u00e1hmans, and the entire system of caste. To some extent, however, they have given way to Hindu prejudices in the matter of purity of food. The ashes of the dead are buried under cromlechs or dolmens, consisting of four upright slabs of stones covered over by a fifth slab. [A fuller account of the Kh\u00e1si tribe will be found in Colonel Dalton's Ethnology of Bengal, pp. 54-58 (Calcutta, 1872), and in the Statistical Account of Assam, vol. ii. pp. 215-220 (London, Tr\u00fcbner & Co., 1879).]\n\nCondition of the People.\u2014Both Kh\u00e1sis and Santengs are a prosperous people. Adult males earn as much as a shilling a day as common labourers, and adult females as much as eightpence. The dwellings of the well-to-do classes are generally constructed of masonry, with a\nthatched roof and a plank floor, and divided into two or three rooms. The furniture consists of a rough bedstead, a seat or two, some cooking utensils, and a few boxes. The ordinary peasants and poorer classes construct their huts of stone, mud or plank walls, with a thatch or cane roof. They are fitted with wooden platforms or loose planks placed on the ground to serve as beds.\n\nThe food of the well-to-do classes consists of rice, fish, fowl, or meat, curry, vegetables, oil, hog's lard, and fermented or spirituous liquor; the expenses of an average-sized household being estimated at about \u00a32, 10s. per month. An ordinary husbandman or labourer lives on rice, dry fish, occasionally a little meat, oil, or hog's lard; the estimated cost of living for an averaged-sized household being about 16s. per month. The few Hindus found in the hills are mere temporary residents, engaged in civil and military employ, who always contemplate returning to their own homes. The traders are for the most part natives of the hills; for the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri merchants, who penetrate into every other corner of Assam, have been able to obtain no footing here in the face of Kh\u00e1si competition.\n\nThe only places in the Kh\u00e1si and Jaintia Hills larger than villages are the two British stations of Shillong and Jowai, and the native towns of Cherra Punji and Shella Punji. Cherra P\u00fanj\u00ed was the chief civil station in the District until 1864, and it is still the centre of the operations of the Welsh Calvinistic Mission. In 1864, the District head-quarters were removed to Shillong, which was selected in 1874 as the permanent seat of the local government of Assam. According to the enumeration of 1881, Shillong then contained 3640 inhabitants. A good cart-road was opened up between Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed in the Brahmaputra valley and Shillong a few years ago, afterwards extended to Cherra P\u00fanj\u00ed, to which place it was opened throughout in January 1883. Large sums of money have also been expended on the erection of public buildings in Shillong. Sanitation is carefully attended to, and an excellent supply of water is conveyed into the town by means of an aqueduct. A project for the supply of a perfectly pure drinking supply to the station was completed in 1883 from a stream running from the high range behind it. Such a supply has also been provided for the cantonments, and for the fast-growing Kh\u00e1si suburb of M\u00e1okhor, which lies to the north of the civil station. Shillong is now supplied with as pure and abundant a water-supply as any station in India. Jow\u00e1i is the residence of the Assistant Commissioner of the Jaintia Hills.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The chief cereal crop cultivated by the Kh\u00e1sis is rice, but even of this they do not grow sufficient for their own consumption. The rice crop is cultivated in two ways\u2014(1) on low marshy land, which can be regularly irrigated by means of artificial channels cut from the\nadjoining hill streams; (2) on high lands, where the grass and low jungle have been previously cut down and burned on the spot. Other crops grown for food are Indian corn, millet, 'Job's tears,' pulses, and an esculent tuberous root called soh-phlang, resembling a small potato. P\u00e1n or betel-leaf and sup\u00e1ri or betel-nut are largely grown, both for consumption and export. The following four crops are cultivated in large quantities, chiefly for exportation to Bengal:\u2014(1) Potatoes, (2) oranges, (3) pine-apples, (4) tezp\u00e1t or bay-leaves. Sugar-cane is grown in some places, and cotton in the lower hills towards the Brahmaputra valley. Potatoes were first introduced into the hills in 1830. In 1876\u201377, the export of potatoes was estimated at 7,480 tons, valued at \u00a350,125. Orange, limes, and pine-apples are grown to great perfection on the southern slopes of the hills, whence Calcutta draws its supply of these fruits. In 1876\u201377, the export of oranges was valued at \u00a33760, and of pine-apples at \u00a3800.\n\nIn the Jaintia Hills the use of the plough is common, but in the Kh\u00e1si Hills no agricultural implement is to be seen except the hoe. Manure in the form of cow-dung is generally used for rice and potatoes. Irrigation is regularly practised, the water being brought to the land by means of channels cut from the numerous hill streams in the neighbourhood of the fields. Wells and tanks are unknown. The total area under cultivation is estimated at only 302 square miles, but an additional 388 square miles are cultivable. The principal crops are thus distributed\u2014rice, 59,880 acres; other food-grains, 57,820 acres; potatoes, 33,880 acres; cotton, 1076 acres; tea, 224 acres. The average out-turn per acre is returned at 6 cwt. of rice, 2 cwt. of other food-grains, 40 cwt. of potatoes, and 1\u00bd cwt. of cotton. The relations of landlord and tenant do not exist throughout the hills. The land is the absolute property of the cultivators, who occupy and cultivate their hereditary lands, and who pay no rent or revenue either to the British Government or to their own chiefs. Natural calamities, such as blight, flood, or drought, are almost unknown, and have never occurred on such a scale as to affect the general harvest. The price of rice is directly determined by the rates ruling in the neighbouring markets of Sylhet and K\u00e1mr\u00fap, from which the larger portion of the food supply is drawn.\n\nCommerce, etc.\u2014The trade of the Kh\u00e1si Hills is very considerable. This tract possesses almost a monopoly of certain valuable products; and the natives, who are notoriously keen at a bargain, retain all the profits in their own hands. According to estimates carefully compiled by the Deputy Commissioner, the exports in 1876\u201377 were valued at \u00a3160,000, chiefly potatoes, limestone, cotton, stick-lac, tezp\u00e1t or bay-leaves, oranges, betel-nuts, and betel-leaves. The imports were valued at \u00a3157,000, chiefly rice, dry fish, cotton, cloth, salt, wheat-flour,\ntobacco, oil, and gh\u00ed. By far the greater portion of the trade is conducted at a row of markets along the southern foot of the hills, of which Chh\u00e1tak on the Surm\u00e1, in Sylhet District, is the most important. The trade on the K\u00e1mr\u00fap side is comparatively small, except for the importation of rice.\n\nThe chief means of communication in the District is the road opened in 1877 for wheeled traffic from Gauh\u00e1ti to Shillong, on the Brahmaputra. This road is 64 miles in length, and its construction is described as a model of engineering skill. It has since been extended to Cherra P\u00fanj\u00ed, a further distance of about 30 miles, and is open for wheeled traffic throughout. There are seven other roads through the hills, maintained at the public expense. These are\u2014(1) Shillong to Sohrarim via Laitlyngkot; (2) Shillong to Jow\u00e1i; (3) Jow\u00e1i to Jaintiapur; (4) Jow\u00e1i to Nurtiang; (5) Shillong to Sympur; (6) Shillong to Nongstoin; (7) Maophlang to Jirang via Nong-khlao. The manufactures of the District are insignificant. Besides a decaying business in iron-smelting, they comprise coarse cotton and randia cloth, plain silverwork, rude implements of husbandry, netted bags made of pine-apple fibre, common pottery, mats, and baskets.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The Kh\u00e1si and Jaintia Hills constitute a Political Agency, independent of the ordinary jurisdiction. The British territory, which consists of the whole of the Jaintia Hills, the stations of Shillong and Cherra P\u00fanj\u00ed, and a number of villages in the Kh\u00e1si Hills, is administered under a special code by the Deputy Commissioner and his Assistants. The Kh\u00e1si petty States, 25 in number, are presided over by elective chiefs, variously styled Seims, W\u00e1had\u00e1d\u00e1rs, Sard\u00e1rs, and Langdohs. These chiefs have jurisdiction over their own subjects in all cases except homicide. The British Government undertakes the management of the natural products of the country, such as lime, coal, timber, and elephants, and pays over to the chiefs a half share of the profits. Their other sources of revenue are market dues, court fines, and various cesses. Their aggregate income is approximately estimated at \u00a33200, of which about \u00a3600 is derived from lime quarries.\n\nIn 1881\u201382, the total revenue of the District to the British Government amounted to \u00a310,700, of which the larger portion came from royalties on lime quarries and the house-tax; the expenditure in the same year was \u00a310,917. The house-tax is levied throughout the Jaintia Hills, and from the British villages in the Kh\u00e1si Hills, at the rate of 2s. or 4s. per house; in 1881\u201382, the total realized was \u00a31660. The land-tax is applied to some petty holdings in the Jaintia Hills, a few building sites at Jow\u00e1i and Cherra P\u00fanj\u00ed, and the waste land grants at the foot of the Jaintia Hills towards Sylhet; the total is only \u00a3197 a year, derived from 34 estates. In 1881\u201382, there were 4 magisterial\nand 3 civil courts in the District, and 2 European officers. The headquarters of a regiment of Assam Light Infantry are stationed at Shillong, with an outpost at Jowai. For police purposes, the District is divided into 3 thanas or police circles, with 2 outposts. In 1881, the regular police force numbered 168 men of all ranks, maintained at a total cost of \u00a32854. These figures show 1 policeman to every 36\u00b768 square miles of area, or to every 1008 persons of the population; the cost being 9s. 3d. per square mile and 4d. per head. The administration of justice is mainly conducted in criminal cases by the petty chiefs, and in civil cases before panchayats or indigenous courts of arbitration; only heinous crimes or important suits are referred to the British officers. In 1881, the number of offences reported was 172; the number of persons tried was 180, of whom 132 or 73\u00b734 per cent. were convicted. The civil cases tried before the courts numbered 101. There is a jail at Shillong. In 1881, the daily average number of prisoners was 43\u00b728, of whom 2\u00b770 were females. The total expenditure was \u00a3732, or an average of \u00a315, 18s. for each prisoner.\n\nThe management of education in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills is chiefly in the hands of the Welsh Calvinistic Mission, whose efforts have been rewarded by most satisfactory results. In 1874-75, the total number of schools open in the District was 73, attended by 1666 pupils, which by 1881-82 had increased to 107 schools, attended by 2551 pupils, being 1 school to every 57 square miles, and 1 pupil to every 66 inhabitants. The total expenditure on education in the latter year was \u00a33806, towards which Government contributed \u00a31586; the average cost per pupil was \u00a31, 9s. 10d. English is taught in 46 schools out of the 107. The Normal School for higher instruction was attended by 44 pupils, of whom 9 were girls. The number of girls attending school increased from 344 in 1874-75 to 742 in 1881, showing 8\u00b735 pupils to every thousand of the female population.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills is mild and equable, though in some parts excessively humid. At Shillong, the thermometer rarely exceeds 80\u00b0 F., and has been known to fall to 38\u00b0. Hoar frost lies on the ground almost every morning during the months of December, January, and February. Shallow water occasionally freezes over, but snow never falls. The rainfall at Cherra Punji is enormous. The average during the 25 years ending 1881 is returned at 489 inches; and 805 inches are said to have fallen in 1861, including 366 inches in the single month of July. At Shillong, where the clouds rolling up from the plains of Bengal have already spent their force on three intervening ridges, the annual rainfall declines to an average of about 88 inches; and at Jowai, which occupies an intermediate position, the average is 362 inches. The rainy season is confined to the five months from May to November. The District is liable to\nshocks of earthquake, one of which, in 1875, did much damage to the houses in Shillong.\n\nGenerally speaking, the climate of the hills is healthy, both for natives and Europeans. Malarious fevers do not exist, except in the marshy strip or *tard\u00ed* on the northern frontier. Cholera never prevails, unless directly imported from the plains. The chief diseases are fevers of a typhoid character, or at least engendered by insanitary conditions of life; small-pox, dysentery, and bowel complaints. Europeans on first arriving at Shillong frequently suffer from disorders of the liver; but afterwards enjoy excellent health, when they have once passed through a short period of acclimatizing indisposition. European children thrive remarkably. Except in the case of Shillong, no regard is paid to the requirements of conservancy in any Kh\u00e1si village. The collection of vital statistics was commenced in the District in 1882 in certain representative areas. The charitable dispensary at Shillong was attended in 1881 by 101 in-door and 1133 out-door patients. The total expenditure was \u00a3306, towards which Government contributed \u00a3120.

They bound Pesh\u00e1war District to the south, and extend from the Sufed Koh system to the Indus. In Koh\u00e1t they consist of an intricate network of barren and almost perpendicular ridges, intersected by deep valleys, whose sides are clothed with jungle and scored by innumerable ravines. Patches of cultivation, however, nestle in the open glades, while occasional clumps of acacia and wild olive relieve the sterile monotony of the bare gorges. The Teri Toi river divides the system into two main groups, the southern of which contains the famous salt mines of Narri, Bah\u00e1dur Khel, and Kharrak; while the mines of Malgin and Jatta lie among the spurs of the northern range. The peaks of the south-eastern group seldom exceed 3000 feet; but Sw\u00e1nai S\u00edr, in the opposite range, has an elevation of 4785 feet above sea-level.\n\nThe salt, which gives these mountains their chief importance, occurs as a solid rock, uncovered and exposed in many places, so as to be quarried rather than mined. The deposit may probably rank as one of the largest in the world. It has a bluish-grey colour,\nbut grinds white. Large quantities are exported to the Punjab towns, to Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, and to the surrounding countries generally. The Government Preventive Establishment consisted in 1872 of 204 persons, maintained at a total annual cost of \u00a31678. The total quantity of salt extracted from the five mines in 1870-71 amounted to 407,098 maunds, and the duty realized was \u00a38556. In 1882-83, the annual out-turn was returned at 416,616 maunds. The head-quarters of the salt establishment are at Jatta.\n\nThe Khatak hills on the border of Pesh\u00e1war District have an average height of about 3000 feet above sea-level, but the highest peak, that of Jaw\u00e1la S\u00edr, close to the sanitarium of Charat, reaches an elevation of 5110 feet. The celebrated shrine of K\u00e1k\u00e1 S\u00e1hib is situated in Pesh\u00e1war District, at the foot of these hills, and forms the headquarters of the powerful clan of K\u00e1k\u00e1 Khels, descendants of Shaikh R\u00e1him K\u00e1r, a Khatak. They are venerated by the other inhabitants as holy men, and travel to all parts of Central Asia as traders. The M\u00edr Kal\u00e1n pass runs through these hills, and a wide road has been made for military purposes. A bungalow is situated on the Koh\u00e1t side. Slate is found in considerable quantities at the foot of the hills.\n\nKhat\u00e1o.\u2014Sub-division of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 497 square miles; number of villages, 84. Population (1872) 66,104; (1881) 74,027, namely, 36,839 males and 37,188 females. Hindus numbered 71,327; Muhammadans, 2072; and \u2018others,\u2019 628. Contains 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; police station (th\u00e1n\u00ed), 1; regular police, 56 men; village watchmen, 214. Land revenue, \u00a315,490.\n\nKh\u00e1tauli.\u2014Commercial town in J\u00e1nsath tahsil, Muzaffarnagar District, North-Western Provinces. Distant from Muzaffarnagar town 13\u00bd miles south. Lat. 29\u00b0 17' N., long. 77\u00b0 46' 10\" E. Population (1872) 6409; (1881) 7574, namely, 3342 Hindus, 3601 Muhammadans, 628 Jains, and 3 Christians. Area of town site, 76 acres. Kh\u00e1tauli is a place of increasing importance as a mart for the exchange of country produce, and is a station on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway. There are four Jain temples, and the Jain inhabitants are thriving grain dealers. It contains a good b\u00e1z\u00e1r, with a well-paved road; good communications with the surrounding country. For police and sanitary purposes, a house-tax is levied. Police station, post-office, school, and encamping ground.\n\nKh\u00e1tmand\u00fa (K\u00e1thm\u00e1nd\u00fa).\u2014Capital of the Native State of Nep\u00e1l; situated towards the western side of the valley, about a mile from the base of Mount Nagarjun, standing on the east bank of the Vishnumati river at its junction with the B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed; approximate latitude 27\u00b0 42' N., longitude 85\u00b0 12' E. The population is estimated by the State authorities at 50,000, occupying about 5000 houses, which are usually from two to four storeys high, made of brick, and tiled or (in the suburbs)\nthatched; many houses possess large projecting wooden windows or balconies, often richly carved. The majority of the inhabitants belong to the Newar class, half of whom are Buddhists. The G\u00farkhas form but an inconsiderable minority. There are many small open spaces in various parts of the town, paved, like the streets, with brick and stone; in these the markets are held, and Dr. Wright (History of Nep\u00e1l, 1877) notices that in the mornings these places are quite gay with the flowers, fruit, and vegetables exposed for sale. The general shape of the city is very irregular, but it is said by the Hindus to resemble the khora or sword of the goddess Dev\u00ed, while the Buddhist Newars declare it to have been built after the shape of the sword of the great founder of the city, Manj\u00fasri. They state that the handle or blunt extremity of this traditionary sword is directed to the south, towards the confluence of the B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed and Vishnumati rivers, while its apex points to the north, where it terminates in the suburb of Timm\u00e1le, which stretches round or rests upon it as the chhattra or cloth does upon the point of Manj\u00fasri\u2019s sword. Kh\u00e1tm\u00e1ndu is said to have been founded by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Gunak\u00e1madeva about A.D. 723.\n\nThe greatest length of the city from north to south is about a mile, and its breadth varies from one-fourth to one-third of a mile. The Vishnumati is crossed by two masonry bridges, over one of which runs the road from the city to the arsenal and parade-ground, and over the other the direct road to the temple of Sh\u00e1mbun\u00e1th. The earliest name by which the city was known was Manju Patan, after Manj\u00fasri, its traditional founder. Its modern name is said to be derived from an ancient building which stands in the heart of the city near the royal palace, and which is still known among the Newars as K\u00e1thm\u00e1nd\u00fa, from k\u00e1th, \u2018wood\u2019 (of which material it is chiefly composed), and mandi or mandon, an \u2018edifice,\u2019 \u2018house,\u2019 or \u2018temple.\u2019 This building was erected by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Lachmina Singh Mal, A.D. 1596, not as a temple (though there are some figures of Siva inside it), but as a house of accommodation for religious mendicants, and it has always been used for that purpose. The walls of the city have been allowed to fall into decay, and in many places are now hardly distinguishable. Many of the gateways, of which there were thirty-two, are still standing, but the gates themselves have long since disappeared. There are said to be thirty-two small squares or tol\u00e1s in the city, of which the following only are now of importance: Assan tol\u00e1, Indra Chauk, Kh\u00e1tm\u00e1ndu, Toba tol\u00e1, Laghan tol\u00e1, and the square in front of the Darb\u00e1r or royal palace.\n\nThe Darb\u00e1r covers a considerable extent of ground, in the form of an irregular quadrangle. To the north it is partly open to the city, and is flanked by the lofty Taliju temple. At the southern end is the council-chamber, the Basantpur, and the long modern\nDarb\u00e1r or public reception room. On the east it encloses the royal garden and stables, and on the west, which is its principal front, it is open to the street, and forms one side of a rambling irregular square, in which are clustered together a number of Hindu temples, originally built by the Newars. Opposite the north-west corner of the Darb\u00e1r is the K\u00f3t, or military council-chamber, in which was enacted the massacre of 1846. The Kot-ling, Dhunsar, and other courts of law are also situated around the western front of the Darb\u00e1r. Several of the Sard\u00e1rs have, during the last few years, built large houses in different parts of the city, which, from their imposing appearance, contrast very strongly with the humble and dirty Newar dwellings in their neighbourhood.\n\nDr. Wright gives the following description of the chief objects of interest at Kh\u00e1m\u00e1ndu:\n\n\u2018In the centre of the town stands the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s palace, which is a huge, rambling, ungainly building. Part of it is very old, built in pagoda fashion, and covered with elaborate and grotesque carvings. Other parts of it, such as the Darb\u00e1r room, have been built within the last ten years, and possess glass windows, which are rare in Nep\u00e1l, being found only in the houses of the wealthiest. In the square in front of the palace are numerous handsome temples. Many of these are like pagodas, of several storeys in height, and profusely ornamented with carvings, painting, and gilding. The roofs of many of them are entirely of brass or copper gilt, and along the eaves of the different storeys are hung numerous little bells, which tinkle in the breeze. At some of the doorways are placed a couple of large stone lions or griffins, with well-curled manes, which remind one strongly of the figures found at Nineveh.\n\n\u2018Another description of temple is built of stone, with pillars and a dome. Though less ornamented and less picturesque, this style is far more graceful than the other. Close to the palace, on the north, is the temple of Taliju, one of the largest of the pagoda type. It is said to have been built by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Mahendra Male, about A.D. 1549. It is devoted entirely to the use of the royal family. In front of several of the temples are tall monoliths, some surmounted by figures of old R\u00e1j\u00e1s, who founded the temples, others by the winged figure of Gar\u00far. The figures are often in a kneeling posture, facing a temple, and are generally overhung by a brazen snake, on whose head is perched a little bird. Not far from the palace, and close to one of the temples, is an enormous bell, suspended to stone pillars; and in another building are two huge drums, about eight feet in diameter. The bell is sounded by pulling the tongue, but the peal is by no means what might be expected from its size. Here, too, are several huge and hideous figures of Hindu gods and goddesses,\nwhich on festival days are dressed up and ornamented in the usual way.\n\n'About 200 yards from the palace stands a large semi-European building, called the K\u00f3t, which is famous as being the place where, in 1846, the massacre took place of almost all the leading men of the country, by which event the [late] prime minister, Sir Jang Bah\u00e1dur, was established in power.\n\n'Besides the temples already noticed, many others are to be found in every street and lane. In fact, at a first glance, the town seems to consist of almost nothing but temples. They vary in size from the gigantic pagoda of Taliju to a diminutive shrine cut out of a single stone, with an image a few inches high in the centre. Many of them present a most repulsive appearance, being dabbled over with the blood of cocks, ducks, goats, and buffaloes, which are sacrificed before them.\n\n'The streets of Kh\u00e1tm\u00e1ndu are very narrow\u2014mere lanes, in fact; and the whole town is very dirty. In every lane there is a stagnant ditch full of putrid mud, and no attempt is ever made to clean these thoroughly. The streets, it is true, are swept in the centre, and part of the filth is carried off by the sellers of manure; but to clean the drains would now be impossible without knocking down the entire city, as the whole ground is saturated with filth. The houses are generally built in the form of hollow squares, opening off the streets by low doorways; and these central courtyards are too often only receptacles for rubbish of every sort. In short, from a sanitary point of view, Kh\u00e1tm\u00e1ndu may be said to be built on a dunghill in the middle of latrines!\n\n'On leaving the town by the north-east gateway, and turning to the south, the first object one sees is a large tank, the R\u00e1nipukhri, or Queen's Tank. It is surrounded by a wall, and in the centre is a temple, united to the western bank by a long narrow brick bridge. On the south side is a large figure of an elephant, cut out of, or rather built of, stone, bearing the image of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Prat\u00e1pa Male, the maker of the tank, and of his R\u00e1ni. A little farther south, the road passes through an avenue of buk\u00e1yun (Cape lilac) trees, which runs between the city and the great parade-ground or Thandikhel. This ground is a large open space, covered with a fine greensward, and here the troops are daily drilled and exercised. In the centre used to stand a square stone building\\(^1\\) about 30 feet high, erected by Sir Jang Bah\u00e1dur after his return from England in 1851. On the top was a figure of Sir Jang Bah\u00e1dur, holding a sword in one hand and a scroll in the other, and at the four corners were hideous brazen griffins or dragons. All these have, however, been removed to a new temple built by Sir Jang Bah\u00e1dur on the bank of the B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed. To the west\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Removed in 1882.\nof the parade-ground is a more graceful object, namely the Dar\u00e9ra or column erected by a former prime minister, General Bh\u00edmasen Th\u00e1p\u00e1. This column is beautifully proportioned, standing on a base of stone, and rising to a height of 250 feet. This is the second column of the kind that was built by Bh\u00edmasen, the first having been thrown down by a violent earthquake in 1833. The column now standing was struck by lightning in 1856, and a large rent was made all down one side. It was repaired, however, in 1869, and now looks as well as ever. There is a good winding staircase inside, and from the windows at the top a fine bird's-eye view of the town and its environs may be obtained.\n\n'A little farther south stands the arsenal,\u00b9 and to the east of the parade-ground are store-houses for ammunition, cannon, etc., and a manufactory where these are cast and bored. A new workshop on a larger scale has lately been built about 4 miles south of the city, on a small stream, the Nukk\u00fa, near Chaubah\u00e1l.\n\n'The road now turns to the east, and at about a mile south-east of Kh\u00e1tm\u00e1ndu it reaches Th\u00e1tpatali, the residence of [the late] Sir Jang Bah\u00e1dur. This is an immense building, or rather range of buildings, situated close to the northern bank of the B\u00e1ghmati, just where it is crossed by a bridge leading to Patan.'\n\nA British Resident, with a small staff and escort, is stationed at Kh\u00e1tm\u00e1ndu. The Residency is situated about a mile out of the city on the north side, in a spot described by Dr. Wright (who was Residency Surgeon) as one of the best wooded and most beautiful in the valley, though it was originally assigned for a Residency 'because, owing to a deficient supply of water, it was a barren patch, supposed to be very unhealthy, and to be the abode of demons.'\n\nThe present minister, Sir Ranadip Singh, has a very extensive residence at Naiainhitti, to the north-east of the city. The military force maintained in Kh\u00e1tm\u00e1ndu and its suburbs numbers about 12,000 men, in twenty infantry battalions, with 250 field-pieces, all of which are of small calibre, and many are unserviceable. There are several magazines in and about the city, filled with muskets and rifles mostly of obsolete patterns, old equipments, accoutrements, and other material of war.\n\nKh\u00e1tm\u00e1ndu is an open town, and is connected with the neighbouring towns of B\u00e1tgaon, Patan, and Thankot by bridged carriage roads. There are no manufactures of any importance.\n\nKhed (or Kher).\u2014Sub-division of Ratn\u00e1giri District, Bombay Presidency. Bounded on the north by Kol\u00e1ba District; on the east by S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District; on the south by Chiplun; and on the west by D\u00e1poli. It lies fifteen miles inland, with the Sub-division of\n\n\u00b9 On the completion of the Nukk\u00fa buildings this arsenal was abandoned.\nD\u00e1poli between it and the sea. Area, 400 square miles. Population (1881) 91,492, namely, 44,024 males and 47,468 females, dwelling in 146 villages, containing 17,204 houses; density of population, 228 persons to the square mile. Hindus numbered 84,116; Muhammadans, 7329; and 'others,' 47.\n\nThe Sub-division consists of a rugged and hilly surface, with patches of poor land. The north-west is much broken by ravines; in the north-east are the three lofty hills of Mahipatgarh, Sum\u00e1rgarh, and Ras\u00e1lgarh, detached from the range of the Sahy\u00e1dris by the deep valley of the Jagbudi. Across the Sahy\u00e1dris, the principal passes from the Sub-division are the Hatlot and the Amb\u00e1oli, the latter passable by pack-bullocks. The village sites alone are protected by shade-giving trees; near the villages are numerous sacred groves. The sea-breeze is but little felt. The average rainfall for ten years ending 1877 was 130.5 inches. The river Jagbudi is navigable for small craft as far as Khed, where a hot spring is found. Grain, rice, and pulses are the staple crops. In 1878, the agricultural stock consisted of\u2014horned cattle, 36,774; sheep and goats, 2793; horses, 21; ploughs, 10,362; and carts, 33. Of the 187,949 acres under actual cultivation in 1878, grain crops occupied 98 per cent. Of the whole, rice occupied 18,794 acres, and n\u00e1chni (Eleusine corocana) 34,700 acres. In 1884, the Sub-division contained 2 criminal courts; police stations, 3; regular police, 52 men. Land revenue (1878\u201379), \u00a39262.\n\nKhed (or Kher).\u2014Town and head-quarters of the Khed Sub-division, Ratn\u00e1giri District, Bombay Presidency. Situated at the head of the Jagbudi river, and surrounded by hills. The population in 1872 was 3817. Not separately returned in the Census Report of 1881. A cart-road connects Khed with the port of Harnai, 26 miles distant. Boats of light draught work up from Dabhol and Anjanwel to Khed. Post-office, school, and rest-house for travellers. East of the town are three small rock temples, now inhabited by a family of lepers.\n\nKhed (or Kher).\u2014Sub-division of Poona District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 888 square miles. Population (1872) 139,152; (1881) 141,890, namely, 70,811 males and 71,079 females, dwelling in 244 villages, containing 24,054 houses. Density of population, 159 persons to the square mile. Hindus numbered 136,395; Muhammadans, 3601; 'others,' not specified, 1894. The Sub-division in 1884 contained 1 civil and 3 criminal courts; police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 2; regular police, 76 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 156. Land revenue (1883), \u00a315,980.\n\nKhed (or Kher).\u2014Town and municipality in Poona (P\u00fana) District, Bombay Presidency; situated on the left bank of the river Bh\u00edma, 26 miles north of Poona city. Lat. 18\u00b0 51' N., long. 73\u00b0 55' 30\" E. Population (1881) 3836; municipal revenue (1882\u201383), \u00a344; municipal\nexpenditure, \u00a379; incidence of municipal taxation, 3s. 3\u00bdd. Post-office and dispensary, and head-quarters of the revenue and police officers of the Sub-division. Khed has a village area of upwards of 20 square miles. Within those limits are at least three places of interest, from an architectural or archaeological point of view, viz. the tomb and mosque of Dil\u00e1war Kh\u00e1n, and an old Hindu temple of Siddheswar, on the left bank of the Bh\u00edma river.\n\n**Khejiri.**\u2014Village near the mouth of the H\u00fagli river in Midnapur District, Bengal.\u2014See KEDGEREE.\n\n**Kh\u00e9kera** (or Kahkra).\u2014Town in B\u00e1gp\u00e1t tahsil, Meerut (Merath) District, North-Western Provinces; situated 26 miles from Meerut city. Population (1865) 6045; in 1872, the population having fallen to below 5000, it was not returned separately in the Census Report; by 1881, however, the population had risen to 6972, namely, Hindus, 5715; Muhammadans, 879; and Jains, 378. Said to have been founded about 1500 years ago by Ah\u00edrs, who were subsequently ousted by J\u00e1ts from Sikandarpur. Fine Jain temple; second-class police station. Large annual fair. During the Mutiny, the proprietor of the village rebelled, and his estate was confiscated and made over to some neighbouring loyal zamind\u00e1rs.\n\n**Kh\u00e9l\u00e1t** (Kal\u00e1t or Eastern Baluchist\u00e1n).\u2014A collection of chiefships inhabited by tribes of Baluch\u00eds, acknowledging subordination to the Kh\u00e1n of Kh\u00e9l\u00e1t, who is the ruler of Baluchist\u00e1n (q.v.).\n\n**Kh\u00e9l\u00e1t** (Kal\u00e1t).\u2014Chief town of the territories of the Kh\u00e1n of Kh\u00e9l\u00e1t, in Baluchist\u00e1n; situated on the northern spur of a limestone hill called the Sh\u00e1h Mard\u00e1n. Lat. 28\u00b0 53' N., long. 66\u00b0 28' E. It is about 6783 feet above sea-level, and has, in consequence, a temperate climate approximating to places situate in much higher latitudes. Kh\u00e9l\u00e1t is a fortified town built in terraces, and has three gates, known as the Kh\u00e1ni, Mast\u00fang, and Bel\u00e1i\u2014the two latter named, no doubt, from the roads leading to Mast\u00fang and Bel\u00e1, which pass through them. The streets are extremely narrow, tortuous, and dirty. The walls are built of mud, with bastions at intervals; and both walls and bastions are said to be pierced with numerous loopholes for musketry. Only a few guns are mounted on them. The b\u00eds\u00e1r of Kh\u00e9l\u00e1t is reported to be large and well supplied with all kinds of necessaries; and the town itself is furnished with very clear and pure water from a stream which rises in the base of a limestone hill on the eastern side of the valley. The miri, or old fort, now forms the palace of the Kh\u00e1n, and overhangs the town. It consists of a confused mass of buildings closely crowded together. Cook says it is an imposing and antique structure, and probably the most ancient edifice in Baluchist\u00e1n, owing its foundation to the Hindu kings who preceded the present Muhammadan dynasty. From the Darb\u00e1r or\ngrand reception room in this building, which has an open balcony, a most extensive view is obtained, embracing the whole valley and surrounding hills.\n\nKhel\u00e1t has two suburbs, the one on the west and the other on the east side. They would appear to be extensive, and it is here that the B\u00e1bi portion of the community reside. The number of houses, according to Bellew, is 3500, which would imply a population of about 14,000 persons; but this no doubt includes the suburbs. Masson states the total number of houses to have been, in his time, only 1100, which would give probably not more than between 4000 and 5000 inhabitants in all; but he has nevertheless estimated the population of Khel\u00e1t and its environs at 14,000, which would thus show Bellew's calculation to be correct. The town of Khel\u00e1t is inhabited by Brah\u00fas, Hindus, Dehw\u00e1rs, and B\u00e1bis or Afgh\u00e1ns, the latter residing chiefly, as has previously been stated, in the suburbs. The Brah\u00fas form the great bulk of the inhabitants; but the cultivation is chiefly carried on by the Dehw\u00e1r communities. There are several villages and walled gardens clustered together in the valley east of the town; of these, Si\u00e1lkoh is one of the largest, having about 100 houses, or, say, 450 inhabitants. The trade and manufactures of Khel\u00e1t are in every way slight and unimportant. Sir Frederick Goldsmid, whose opinion merits the highest consideration, prefers rendering the name as Kal\u00e1t.\u2014See BALUCHISTAN.\n\nKhem Karn.\u2014Town and municipality in Kas\u00far tahsil, Lahore District, Punjab; 7 miles from Kas\u00far town, with which place it is connected by a metalled road. Lat. 31\u00b0 9' N., long. 74\u00b0 36' 30\" E. Situated on the old bank of the Beas (Bi\u00e1s), at the edge of the barren upland known as the M\u00e1njh\u00e1, 34 miles south of Lahore city. Population (1868) 5847; (1881) 5516, namely, Muhammadans, 3458; Hindus, 1650; and Sikhs, 408. Municipal revenue (1875\u201376), \u00a3327; (1882\u201383), \u00a3402, or average incidence, 1s. 6\u00bdd. per head. In former days Khem Karn must have been a place of more importance than at present, as there are a number of ruins scattered around beyond its present limits. It is surrounded by a thick, well-built masonry wall, buttressed at intervals. The main streets are all paved, and it has two or three straight and fairly broad b\u00e1z\u00e1rs. The town contains some good houses, and has a fine b\u00e1oli or public reservoir, with steps leading down to the water's edge. It is not, however, a place of much commercial importance, although a flourishing manufacture of country blankets affords employment to about three hundred families. The public buildings include a municipal hall, school-house, police station, and rest-house. The Kas\u00far branch of the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b Canal passes the town.\n\nKher\u00e1l\u00ed.\u2014Petty State in the Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1war,\nBombay Presidency; consisting of 2 villages, Kher\u00e1l\u00ed and V\u00e1dla, with 3 separate shareholders. Area of the estate, 11 square miles; population (1881) 1658. Estimated revenue (1881), \u00a31061; tribute of \u00a367, 16s. is paid to the British Government. Kher\u00e1l\u00ed village is situated 2\u00bd miles south of the Wadwh\u00e1n station on the Bhaunagar-Gondal Railway. Population (1881) 1155.\n\nKher\u00e1l\u00ed.\u2014Town in Kadi Division, Baroda (G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r's territory), Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency. Lat. 23\u00b0 54' N., long. 72\u00b0 40' E. Population (1872) 8212; (1881) 8528, namely, 4030 males and 4498 females. Contains a civil court (kachhari), police station, two rest-houses, a post-office, and a Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed school. The Gos\u00e1vji's temple is famous as having been founded by the Vishnuite reformer Vallabh\u00e1ch\u00e1rya, who is said to have dwelt here.\n\nKheri.\u2014District in the S\u00edt\u00e1pur Division of Oudh, under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 27\u00b0 41' and 28\u00b0 42' N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 4' 30\" and 81\u00b0 23' E. long. The largest District in Oudh, in the extreme north-west of the Province. Bounded on the north by the river Mohan, separating it from Nep\u00e1l; on the east by the Kauri\u00e1l\u00e1 river, separating it from Bahr\u00e1ich; on the south by S\u00edt\u00e1pur District; and on the west by Sh\u00e1jh\u00e1j\u00e1npur District, in the North-Western Provinces. Area (1881), 2992 square miles. Population, according to the Census of 1881, 831,922 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at Lakhimpur town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Kheri District consists of a series of fairly elevated plateaux, separated by rivers flowing from the north-west, each of which is bordered by a belt of alluvial land. The rivers are, commencing from the east, the Kauri\u00e1l\u00e1, Suheli, Dah\u00e1war, Chauk\u00e1, Ul, Jamw\u00e1ri, Kathna, G\u00famti, and Sukheta. North of the Ul, the country is what is generally styled tar\u00e1i, and is considered very unhealthy. This tract probably formed in ancient times the bed of a lake, through which two main rivers, the Kauri\u00e1l\u00e1 and Chauk\u00e1, have for thousands of years been forcing their way. These two rivers change their courses constantly, abandoning old channels and opening up new, so that the whole surface is seamed with deserted river beds much below the level of the surrounding country. In these, the vegetation is very dense, and the stagnant waters are the cause of much fever. The people reside in the neighbourhood of the low ground, as the soil is more fertile and less expensive to cultivate than the uplands, which are covered with forests.\n\nSouth of the Ul, the scene changes. Between every two rivers there is a plain, more or less broad, considerably less elevated than the tar\u00e1i tract to the north. There is very little slope in any of these plains for many miles, and marshes are formed, from which\nemerge the head-waters of many secondary streams, but which in the rains become dangerous torrents, and frequently cause devastating floods. The general slope of the country is from north-west to south-east, the highest elevation being 600 feet in the northern forests, and the lowest 375 feet, opposite Mallapur in the extreme south-east. Several large lakes exist; some, formed by the ancient channels of the rivers in the north of the District, being fine sheets of water, from 10 to 20 feet deep and from 3 to 4 miles long, and in places fringed with magnificent groves. In P\u00e1ila and Kheri pargan\u00e1s in the south, there are also large natural lakes. There are no river-side towns, nor do any of the villages in the neighbourhood of the rivers contain any number of persons who live by fishing or river traffic. At the ferries on the Chauk\u00e1 and Kauri\u00e1l\u00e1, merchants encamp during the cold weather and buy up grain, departing before the rains commence.\n\nThe north of the District is covered with forests, occupying an area of 650 square miles. Of this area, 303 square miles were taken up by Government in 1861 and formed into a forest reserve. The remainder was divided into lots of 5000 acres or less, and let out to grantees rent-free for 20 years, and subsequently at half rates, upon the condition that one-fourth of the forest area should be cleared and brought into cultivation within 12 years. Some grants were sold outright at an upset price of 5s. an acre. Hardly any of these forest lessees either brought their land under cultivation under the first set of conditions, or paid up the due instalments of their purchase money under the second. Consequently, 120 square miles of such grants were resumed by Government, raising the present reserved forest area to a total of 423 square miles. Of the 227 square miles still held by private individuals, but little has been brought under the plough. S\u00e1l occupies about two-thirds of the whole forest area. In Khairigarh pargan\u00e1, the trees grow to a large size, there being an average of more than ten to each acre, with a girth of over $4\\frac{1}{2}$ feet. The forests north of the Mohan consist mainly of s\u00e1l and \u00e1san. The banks of the Suheli are fringed with green shisham trees; above them rise masses of khair, with bare branches, and stiff, grey rugged trunks; and beyond them again are the s\u00e1l forests, groups of tall, slender, straight stems, the older trees shooting up for 60 or 70 feet without a branch or bend. In addition to the forest, about 65 square miles of groves, chiefly of mango trees, are distributed over the District.\n\nKheri has no merchantable mineral products, except a little petroleum in Khairigarh pargan\u00e1. Kankar of good quality is met with near Gol\u00e1. Saltpetre is manufactured in large quantities at Dhaurahra. The wild animals include tigers, leopards, antelope, spotted deer, hog-deer, nilgai, principally found in the northern jungles. Tigers, although still\nnumerous, have decreased considerably of late years. Venomous snakes and crocodiles are common.\n\n**History.**\u2014The present District of Kheri has a very brief history, having only existed as an administrative unit since 1858. Under the native sovereigns of Oudh, it lay partly in the Chakl\u00ed of Muhamdi and partly in that of Khair\u00e1b\u00e1d. In 1856, when Oudh was annexed, two Districts were constituted, those of Muhamdi and Mall\u00e1pur, dividing between them the whole of Kheri, in addition to several of the bordering *parsan\u00e1s* now included in Hardoi, S\u00edt\u00e1pur, and Bahr\u00e1\u00edch. Their head-quarters were Muhamdi and Mall\u00e1pur, one to the extreme west of the present District, the other near the south-eastern corner, in S\u00edt\u00e1pur. When the Mutiny broke out, the officers of Muhamdi were captured by the Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur mutineers or by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mitauli and massacred; those at Mall\u00e1pur fled north into the jungles of Nep\u00e1l, being cut off from a retreat to the south, and perished of fever and ague.\n\nWhen the present District of Kheri was constituted in 1858, Lakhimpur was selected for the head-quarters. It is 28 miles due north of, and within easy reach of, S\u00edt\u00e1pur; but it cannot be considered central or very accessible, some villages being about 60 miles distant.\n\nIn Akbar's time, the country was entirely divided among families of *zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs*. The R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Muhamdi, who afterwards acquired nearly the whole District, then held under a royal grant 3000 *bigh\u00e1s* and 5 small villages. The great estate of the Janw\u00e1rs, which under its three heads Kaimahra, Oel, and Mahewa now embraces 330 villages, did not then exist. Similarly the J\u00e1ngres estate of Bh\u00far Dhaurahra, which afterwards covered 800 square miles, did not exist even in the germ. The Ahbans estate of Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra existed in Akbar's time, but was much smaller and more divided, while the great S\u00farajbans estate of Khairigarh is a creation of 1858. In later times, there were four great families who held the lands now comprised in this District\u2014namely, the Sayyids of Barwar, the Ahbans of Mitauli and Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra, the Janw\u00e1rs of Kheri, and the J\u00e1ngres of Dhaurahra.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The population of Kheri District, according to the Census of 1869, but calculated on the area of 1881, amounted to 399,585 males and 338,504 females; total, 738,089. The Census of 1881 returned a total population of 831,922, showing an increase of 93,833, or 12\u00b77 per cent., in twelve years. The main results of the Census of 1881 may be briefly summarized as follows:\u2014Area, 2992 square miles; number of towns and villages, 1655; houses, 142,657. Total population, 831,922, namely, males 445,019, and females 386,903; proportion of males, 53\u00b75 per cent. Average density, 278 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, .55; persons per village, 503; houses per square mile, 47\u00b76; persons per house,\n58. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 727,770, or 87.5 per cent. of the population; Muhammadans, 103,755, or 12.5 per cent.; Christians, 397.\n\nOf the higher Hindu castes, Br\u00e1hmans numbered 67,110, or 9.2 per cent. of the Hindus; the R\u00e1jputs or Kshattriyas, 24,966, or 3.4 per cent.; K\u00e1yasths, 8017; and Baniy\u00e1s, 12,389. The most numerous caste is that of the Cham\u00e1rs, who numbered 108,639, or 14.9 per cent. of the Hindu population; next to them come the Kurm\u00eds with 84,441, or 11.6 per cent.; Ah\u00edrs, 71,984, or 9.9 per cent.; and P\u00e1s\u00eds, 62,748, or 8.6 per cent. The other principal Hindu castes, ranked according to numerical superiority, are\u2014Kachhis, 42,801; Lodh\u00eds, 36,907; Kah\u00e1rs, 28,285; Kor\u00eds, 17,847; Tel\u00eds, 16,195; Gad\u00e1rias, 16,069; Dhob\u00eds, 13,176; Loniy\u00e1s, 13,114; Barh\u00e1is, 10,763; Bhurj\u00eds, 9506; N\u00e1is, 9365; Loh\u00e1rs, 8974; Kalw\u00e1rs, 8056; Kumbh\u00e1rs, 6702; and Gos\u00e1ins, 5084.\n\nThe only remarkable feature presented by the population tables is the comparative scarcity of the higher castes\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, Kshattriyas, K\u00e1yasths, and Vaisyas (the last represented by the Baniy\u00e1 or trading caste of the present day). They number altogether only 112,482, or 15.4 per cent. of the Hindus; in the whole Province of Oudh they amount to 2,387,602, or a fraction over 24 per cent. The reason of this is not far to seek. The low castes are the first, in all instances, to occupy the wilderness, and reclaim it from nature, and much of Kheri District has but very recently been brought under cultivation. There was little to invite the Br\u00e1hman or Kshattriya. There are very few temples, and none of ancient repute; consequently the priestly class is not numerous. Population was so thin that disputes about boundaries, that fertile source of internal warfare, were comparatively rare, and but few professional soldiers were required. The District, too, was so distant from any seat of Government, that there could be little interference with the great landholders, who found it more profitable in many cases to have low-caste industrious tenants than the prouder Aryans.\n\nThe Muhammadan population are almost without exception Sunnis, only 499 out of a total of 103,755 being returned as Shi\u00e1s. Of the 397 Christians, 320 are natives, 62 Europeans, and 15 Eurasians.\n\nAll the towns now existing are of recent foundation. Kheri was founded in the 16th century, Muhamdi and Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d in the 17th. Of their origin, one common tale is told. The Musalm\u00e1n or Kshattriya founder came through the woods and marshes (the country then lying much lower than now), and seized upon the slight hills or hummocks, where some P\u00e1s\u00ed or Ah\u00edr patriarch ruled over a few mud huts. The rightful owner fled deeper into the forest, and the intruder built a block house or a brick fort to guard against his return. Only 5 towns were returned in 1881 as containing upwards of 5000 inhabitants,\nnamely, Lakhimpur, the civil station, 7526; Muhamdi, 6635; Ora Dhakwa, 6533; Kheri, 5996; and Dhauraahra, 5767. Total urban population, 32,457.\n\nLakhimpur, Muhamdi, and Dhauraahra are the only three municipalities. Of the 1655 towns and villages in the District in 1881, 521 are returned as containing less than two hundred inhabitants; 564 from two to five hundred; 340 from five hundred to a thousand; 184 from one to two thousand; 29 from two to three thousand; 12 from three to five thousand; and 5 from five to ten thousand. Classified according to occupation, the Census Report returns the male population under the following six main groups:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including all Government servants, civil and military, and the learned professions, 5245; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 1431; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 7088; (4) agricultural and pastoral, including gardeners, 224,612; (5) manufacturing and industrial, 28,871; (6) indefinite and unspecified (comprising 28,266 general labourers, 149,506 male children, and 'others'), 177,772.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The chief agricultural product is rice, the area under this crop being returned in 1883-84 at 179,047 acres. The area under other crops is thus returned:\u2014Wheat, 132,110 acres; other food-grains, 540,883; oil-seeds, 6918; sugar-cane, 20,596; cotton, 4270; tobacco, 9335; vegetables, 16,531; fibres (other than cotton), 6635 acres. Opium and indigo are also cultivated to a small extent. Total cultivated area (including 133,948 acres of two-crop land), 925,414 acres.\n\nThe rice of Kheri District is of excellent quality, but its cultivation is slovenly. There are two harvests in the year. The kharif or autumn crops consist of rice, kodo, kakan, joar, bajra, mas, and mas, sown from June to August, and reaped between the end of September and the beginning of November. The rabi or spring crops are barley, wheat, gram, peas, and arhar, cut between March and June. The people are employed principally in the cultivation of the soil as tenants. The agricultural stock, in 1882-83, consisted of 93,733 ploughs, 567,395 bullocks and buffaloes. North of the river Ul, land is hardly ever manured, and never irrigated, except the small gardens in which tobacco and vegetables are grown. Total irrigated area, 96,714 acres, all by private industry. South of the Ul, a fair amount of labour is bestowed upon the crops in this respect, although less than is usual in the rest of Oudh.\n\nThe Kurmis, who form the most skilful body of cultivators in the District, are in general tolerably well off; but the mass of the low-caste husbandmen merely live from hand to mouth. The total male agricultural population of Kheri District in 1881 was returned at 223,387, giving an average of 3'32 cultivated acres to each.\ntotal agricultural population, however, dependent on the soil, amounted to 609,654, or 73\u00b728 per cent. of the District population. Of the total area of 2992 square miles, 2425\u00b79 square miles are assessed for Government revenue. Of these, 1122\u00b73 square miles are under cultivation; 999\u00b73 square miles are cultivable; and 304\u00b73 square miles are uncultivable waste. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses on land, \u00a382,664, or an average of 2s. 3\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total amount of rental actually paid by cultivators, including rates and cesses, \u00a3180,008, or an average of 4s. 10\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Rents, although not high, are very uneven. The highest rates seem to be \u00a31, 13s. per acre for tobacco, and \u00a31, 7s. per acre for sugar-cane land, in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d parg\u00e1n\u00e1. The average rent rates per acre for land suited for different crops was returned as follows in 1882-83:\u2014Rice, 4s. 5\u00bdd. per acre; wheat, 7s. 0\u00bdd.; inferior grains, 5s. 9\u00bdd.; indigo, 6s.; cotton, 7s. 9d.; opium, 16s.; oil-seeds, 7s. 4d.; fibres, 5s. 6\u00bdd.; sugar-cane, 13s. 9\u00bdd.; and tobacco, 15s. 5\u00bdd. per acre. The lowest rented lands are the outlying patches far from the sites of villages, in P\u00e1l\u00eda, Kukr\u00e1, and Bh\u00far, where the ordinary rate is 2s. per acre, but even 1s. an acre is met with. Tenants settle on the lands at these low rates, which are raised as population increases. The nominal rents were much the same under the native rulers as at present.\n\nThe principal landholding castes are the J\u00e1ngre, Raikw\u00e1r, S\u00farajbans, and Janw\u00e1r R\u00e1jputs, Sikhs, and Sayyids. According to the Oudh Gazetteer, published in 1877, there were four estates in Kheri each measuring over 100,000 acres. Nine local landholders held in that year estates in this or other Districts averaging about 220 square miles each. There were 12 proprietors holding more than 20,000 acres each; their estates averaged 77,000 acres or 120 square miles in Kheri alone; the aggregate area of their holdings was 1435 square miles, or nearly half the District, and they controlled a population of about 400,000 in this District, and of at least a million in the whole of Oudh. The rest of the villages (656) were owned by 780 zamind\u00e1rs, many owning 2 or 3 villages. There are also a number of subordinate tenures, of which 873 had been decreed in the courts. The cultivators have no fixity of tenure. Out of 1690 villages, reported in the Oudh Gazetteer, R\u00e1jput landlords are returned as holding 850; Muhammadans, 353; K\u00e1yasths, 116; Br\u00e1hmans, 88; and Europeans, 98.\n\nThe average price of food-grains for the ten years ending 1870 is returned as follows:\u2014Unhusked rice, 34 sers per rupee, or 3s. 4d. per cwt.; common rice, 17 sers per rupee, or 6s. 7d. per cwt.; best rice, 7 sers per rupee, or 16s. per cwt.; wheat, 22 sers per rupee, or 5s. 1d. per cwt.; barley, 34 sers per rupee, or 3s. 4d. per cwt.;\nbajra, 30 sers per rupee, or 3s. 9d. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 31 sers per rupee, or 3s. 7d. per cwt. In 1870, the average rates were as follows:\n\u2014Unhusked rice, 26\u00bd sers per rupee, or 4s. 3d. per cwt.; common rice, 13 sers per rupee, or 8s. 7d. per cwt.; best rice, 5\u00bd sers per rupee, or \u00a31 per cwt.; wheat, 21 sers per rupee, or 5s. 4d. per cwt.; barley, 31 sers per rupee, or 3s. 6\u00bdd. per cwt.; bajra, 36 sers per rupee, or 3s. 1d. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 25 sers per rupee, or 4s. 6d. per cwt. In 1883\u201384, the rates for common rice were 16\u00bd sers per rupee, or 6s. 9d. per cwt.; best rice, 10\u00bd sers per rupee, or 10s. 8d. per cwt.; wheat, 23 sers per rupee, or 4s. 10d. per cwt.; and gram, 25\u00bd sers per rupee, or 4s. 5d. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The District is liable to blights, droughts, and floods, the former, however, doing but little damage. Inundations are very destructive in Dhaurahra, Srinagar, and Firozabad parganas, from the overflow of the Chauk\u00e1; and in Kheri and Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d parganas, from the local rainfall causing the jhils and marshes to overflow into the neighbouring fields. Muhamdi, Magdapur, P\u00e1ila, and Khairigarh have good drainage generally, and do not suffer from floods. Hailstorms seldom occur. Severe famines occurred in 1769, in 1778\u201384, and in 1837, while there has been scarcity in 1865, in 1869, and in 1874: all these were caused by drought. The price of coarse grain reached 7 sers during these famine times; but whenever the cheapest wholesome grain in the market, whether it be kodo, maize, or barley, be priced for any length of time at a higher rate than 15 sers for the rupee, there will undoubtedly be famine. In January 1874, the cheapest grain reached 18 sers.\n\nAs in other Districts of Oudh, the periods in which famine is most to be apprehended are the two months before the rahi harvest is cut, January and February, and the two months before the kharif harvest ripens, July and August. There is perhaps less danger of famine in Kheri than in the adjoining District of Bahr\u00e1ich, because the sugar-cane crop in January, which is an exceptionally large one, mitigates the winter scarcity, and the early half-ripe Indian corn or makit in August is used by those who have nothing left from their rahi harvest.\n\nRoads, Manufactures, Trade, etc.\u2014There are no metalled roads in Kheri, except the line from Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur to Sit\u00e1pur, which passes for 21 miles through the south-west corner of the District. A raised and bridged road runs from Sit\u00e1pur through Oel to Lakhimpur 28 miles, thence to Gol\u00e1 20 miles, and thence to Muhamdi 18 miles. This road now extends to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. The District is well provided with minor unmetalled and unbridged roads. The principal of these are\u2014(1) Lakhimpur to Sujahi; (2) Lakhimpur to Khairigarh; (3) Lakhimpur to Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d; (4) Lakhimpur to Dhaurahra; (5) P\u00e1ila to Mater\u00e1; (6) Gol\u00e1\nto Bhera; and (7) Gol\u00e1 to Khot\u00e1r. Total length of roads in 1882-83, 402\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) miles. The manufactures of the District are confined to weaving and cotton printing, carried on in Kheri pargan\u00e1, but only to meet local requirements. Grain of all kinds is exported, as also are turmeric, tobacco, timber, sugar, syrup, hides, bullocks, and gh\u00ed. Catechu is made in large quantities throughout the northern parts of the District, from the khair tree (Acacia Catechu), the heart-wood of which is chopped out and boiled down by a caste called Khairis. Khaskhas (Andropogon muricatus), the roots of which are used for matting tatl\u00ed screens, is exported in large quantities to Benares and Patn\u00e1.\n\nTwo great annual religious trading fairs are held at Gol\u00e1 Gokarann\u00e1th\u2014one in January attended by about 50,000 people, and the other in February, lasting about fifteen days, at which 150,000 persons are said to assemble. The latter fair is increasing rapidly in importance; goods to the value of about \u00a315,000 being sold annually by traders from all parts of India. The principal trading gh\u00e1ts or landing-places in the District are Dulh\u00e1mau and Pachperi on the Chauk\u00e1, and Shit\u00e1bi and Kat\u00e1i gh\u00e1ts on the Kauri\u00e1l\u00e1, whence grain is exported by means of flat-bottomed boats to Lucknow and Patn\u00e1. The imports, which consist mainly of cotton, salt, country cloth, and English piece-goods, are thought to exceed the exports in value.\n\nAdministration.\u2014For administrative purposes, Kheri District is divided into 3 tahsils and 17 pargan\u00e1s, as follows:\u2014(1) Lakhimpur tahsil, comprising Kheri, Srinagar, Bh\u00far, P\u00e1ila, and Kukr\u00e1 Mail\u00e1n\u00ed pargan\u00e1s; (2) Nigh\u00e1san tahsil, comprising Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d, Dhaurahra, Nigh\u00e1san, Khairigarh, and Palia pargan\u00e1s; (3) Muhamdi tahsil, comprising Muhamdi, Pasgaw\u00e1n, Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d, K\u00e1sta, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Magdapur, and Atwa Pip\u00e1ria,\u2014all of which see separately. The administration is conducted by a Deputy Commissioner, with one or more Assistant Commissioners, and the usual staff of subordinates. The total revenue in 1870 amounted to \u00a374,132, of which \u00a362,471, or six-sevenths of the total, was derived from the land-tax, which is increasing every year. Total cost of administration in 1870, \u00a329,594; but this included the expenses of the Survey Department, then engaged in making a new Land Settlement. In 1882-83, the total revenue amounted to \u00a389,605, of which \u00a379,088 was derived from the land. For police purposes, Kheri is divided into 7 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); the force, including regular police, village watch, and municipal police, numbered, in 1882, 2972 officers and men, maintained at a total cost of \u00a313,557. Average daily number of prisoners in jail in 1882, 193; total number of convicts imprisoned during the year (732 males and 86 females), 818. In respect of education, Kheri is one of the most backward Districts of Oudh. There were in 1882, 90 schools, attended by\n3069 pupils, inspected by the Government Education Department. In addition, there are a number of indigenous uninspected schools.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate of Kheri is reckoned by the natives very malarious beyond the UI, but healthy south of that river. The heat is less than in the surrounding Districts. The mean annual temperature is returned at $79.6^\\circ$ F. The rainfall is above the average of the Province. Cold winds following the course of the rivers sweep from the Nep\u00e1l plateaux through the mountain gorges, and meeting the already saturated atmosphere of the plains, cool it, and precipitate moisture first on the lowlands at their base. The hot vapours from the plains are also cooled by the vast forests which clothe the uplands, and which, being unable to carry so much water, discharge it in rain. The average rainfall during the fourteen years ending 1881 amounted to 42.69 inches, the maximum being 70.2 inches in 1870, and the minimum 23.60 inches in 1881.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The disease most common in this District is intermittent fever, which appears to be endemic in the neighbourhood of Gokarann\u00e1th. Its origin is assigned to the malaria produced by the spontaneous decomposition of vegetable matter after the cessation of the rains, and by imperfect drainage. European and native constitutions alike suffer from its attacks. Spring fever appears mostly among those whose pursuits expose them to the noon-day sun. It assumes a remittent type, and is proportionally more fatal as summer advances. Next in the order of frequency are bowel complaints. As a rule, they increase at harvest-time, and have a fatal tendency when succulent fruit and vegetables are abundant in the market. Cholera became epidemic in this District during the rains of 1867, and was most fatal and persistent in those villages where filth most abounded. In Lakhimpur town, the scourge was apparently introduced on b\u00e1z\u00e1r days, or only occurred sporadically. Pulmonic and rheumatic affections increase in winter.\n\nOf cutaneous affections, herpes deserves notice; it is very prevalent among the natives. It seems to be acquired from the practice of keeping on a dhoti while bathing, and replacing it by a clean one without drying the skin. The disease is seen chiefly about the hips and loins of those affected, and does not yield readily to treatment; strong acetic acid externally is the best remedy. Leprosy is not an uncommon disease. Goitre is most common among the trans-Chauk\u00e1 population. The quality of the water is supposed to be the cause of this disease. Its local distribution is unaccountably capricious, but, as a rule, the great majority of the cases occur within 2 miles of the river bank, particularly in Dhauraha and Paila pargan\u00e1s. Venereal diseases are common, and frequently seen in their secondary and tertiary forms, a fact attributable to neglect or improper\ntreatment of the primary symptoms. Among ophthalmic disorders, those most prevalent are ophthalmitia and nyctalopia; they occur principally in summer. Cataract among the aged is not uncommon. Dropsies of the skin and abdomen are often seen in subjects who have long suffered from marsh fever and enlarged spleen.\n\nIn 1882, the total number of registered deaths in Kheri District was 28,098, showing a death-rate of 33.77 per thousand, as against an average of 23.32 per thousand for the previous five years. Deaths from fevers alone numbered 22,744, and from cholera 3957. There are 5 dispensaries in the District, which in 1882 afforded medical relief to 587 in-door, and 20,318 out-door patients.\n\nCattle plague made its appearance in Kheri in 1870 and 1871, and it is estimated that about one-fourth of the cattle in the District died, viz. 120,000, of an estimated value of \u00a3120,000. Cattle murrain is said to have been unknown prior to this epidemic. [For further information regarding Kheri, see the Gazetteer of Oudh, vol. ii. pp. 140-273 (published by authority, Allahabad, 1877). See also the Settlement Report of the District, by T. R. Redfern, Esq., C.S. (1879); the Census Report of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh for 1881; and the several Annual Administration and Departmental Reports from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nKheri.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Lakhimpur tahsil, Kheri District, Oudh; lying between the Ul and Jamwari rivers on the east and southwest respectively, and bounded on the north-west by P\u00e1ila, and on the south by S\u00edt\u00e1pur pargan\u00e1. Area, 193 square miles, of which 130 are cultivated. Population (1869) 104,916; (1881) 107,668, namely, males 56,951, and females 50,717. The pargan\u00e1 is roughly divided into two parts. One is an upland plateau, largely irrigated from jhils and wells, which contains three-quarters of the total area, the soil nearly all high-class loam. To the north-east of this plateau, along its whole length, lies a slope, 1 or 2 miles in breadth, of lighter soil, which suddenly sinks into the tar\u00e1\u00ed of the Ul. Farther to the south-east, the Kew\u00e1ni river has formed a very extensive tar\u00e1\u00ed of first-class land, separated from the Ul tar\u00e1\u00ed, as far as the borders of Kheri District, by a promontory of high land running south-east from the main plateau. This tar\u00e1\u00ed is at a level of nearly 60 feet beneath the upper ground.\n\nDown the centre of the pargan\u00e1 runs a series of jhils, or marshy lakes. They collect the water of the plateau, which is slightly saucer-shaped. The southern edge is formed by the high bank of the Jamwari, and the northern by the bank of the Ul. These lakes communicate in the rains; and generally there is a slight stream running through to Muhammadpur, where the channel becomes perennial and joins the Kew\u00e1ni. Unfortunately, however, this outlet is not sufficient,\nand the overflow spreads over a great area, as the lowest point of the plateau is only 11 feet lower than the highest. A part of the water also from these lakes, in heavy rain, seeks an outlet through Lakhimpur station to the UI, and five persons were drowned or killed by the floods and falling houses in 1870. This series of lakes offers good facilities for constructing irrigation channels, which will be more required every year. Kheri is well supplied with groves.\n\nBisens appear to have been the earliest landlords in Muhammadan times, having ousted the P\u00e1s\u00eds. The whole pargan\u00e1, however, afterwards became part of the great estate formed by the Barw\u00e1r Sayyids. This family, however, has decayed; and out of the 193 villages now forming the pargan\u00e1, 138 are held by R\u00e1jputs. Small local traffic in grain, and a few settlements of weavers and cotton printers.\n\n**Kheri.**\u2014Town in Kheri District, Oudh, and head-quarters of Lakhimpur tahsil; situated in lat. 27\u00b0 54' N., long. 80\u00b0 51' E. Population (1869) 7001; (1881) 5996, namely, Muhammadans, 3524, and Hindus, 2472. For police and conservancy purposes, a house-tax is levied. Daily market, 14 Hindu temples, 12 mosques, and 3 im\u00e1mh\u00e1rs. The one object of antiquarian interest is the tomb of Sayyid Khurd, who died in 971 A.H. or 1563 A.D.\u2014a building composed of huge kankar blocks.\n\n**Kherkeri\u00e1.**\u2014Village in Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, near the Lakshmi nadi, just beyond the northern frontier of Darrang District, Assam. An annual fair is held here, which is largely attended by people from considerable distances. In 1875, the Bhuti\u00e1s are estimated to have sold goods valued at \u00a31700, chiefly salt, blankets, ponies, gold, and a spice called jabrang; and to have bought goods to the value of \u00a31600, chiefly rice, silk, cloth, cotton cloth, dried fish, and hardware.\n\n**Kherna.**\u2014Seaport in the Salsette Sub-division of Th\u00e1na District, Bombay Presidency. One of the ports of the Panwel customs division. Average annual value of trade during the five years ending 1881\u201382\u2014imports, \u00a335; exports, \u00a3289.\n\n**Khetri.**\u2014Chiefship and town in Jaipur (Jeypore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. The chiefship comprises the pargan\u00e1s of Khetri, Babai, Singhana, and Jhunjhnu, yielding an annual revenue of about \u00a335,000, and paying a tribute of \u00a38000 a year to Jaipur. The chief holds, besides, the pargan\u00e1 of Kot Putli, yielding about \u00a310,000 a year, a possession which was bestowed in perpetuity upon his ancestor, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Abbi Singh, by the British Government, for military services rendered to Lord Lake against the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in the early part of the present century, notably in an important engagement by British troops, under Colonel Monson, with Sindhi\u00e1's army on the banks of the Chambal. Population of the town (1881) 5283, namely, 2592\nmales and 2691 females. Hindus numbered 3929; Muhammadans, 1347; and 'others,' 7. The town is commanded by a citadel of some strength, on the summit of a hill 1000 feet high. It is distant from Jaipur city 75 miles north. In the immediate neighbourhood are valuable copper mines. School, dispensary, imperial post-office.\n\n**Kheura.**\u2014Village in Jehlam (Jhelum) District, Punjab.\u2014See Mayo Mines.\n\n**Khiaodah.**\u2014Petty State in Gwalior, under the G\u00fana (Goona) Sub-agency, Central India. Originally a portion of the Umri State, it now comprises 7 villages, with a population (1881) of 1184, and an income of about \u00a3300. The Th\u00e1kur or chief is not a feudatory of Gwalior.\n\n**Khijadia N\u00e1g\u00e1nio.**\u2014Petty State in the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1war division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village, with 1 proprietor. Estimated revenue (1881), \u00a3100. Tribute of \u00a35, 4s. is paid to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda.\n\n**Khijaria.**\u2014Petty State in the Gohelw\u00e1r division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village, with 2 separate shareholders. Area, 2 square miles. Population (1881) 265. Estimated revenue (1881), \u00a3240. Khijaria village is situated 11 miles north-west of Chital station on the Bhaunagar-Gondal Railway.\n\n**Khijaria.**\u2014Petty State in the Gohelw\u00e1r division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village, with 2 separate shareholders. Area, 1 square mile. Population (1881) 995. Estimated revenue (1881), \u00a3240. Tribute of \u00a338 is payable to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and of \u00a34, 14s. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh. Khijaria village is situated 18 miles south-east of Songarh and 5 miles north-west of Dhola junction on the Bhaunagar-Gondal Railway.\n\n**Khilchipur.**\u2014State under the Bhop\u00e1l Agency, Central India; a tributary of Gwalior. Lat. 23\u00b0 52' to 24\u00b0 17' N., long. 76\u00b0 28' to 76\u00b0 45' E. Chief products\u2014grain and opium. The present Chief of Khilchipur is R\u00e1o Amar Singh, a Khichi R\u00e1jput, who since his accession in 1869 has received the title of R\u00e1o from the British Government. He was adopted, with the consent of Sindhia, by the widow of the late Chief, and the adoption was confirmed by the British Government. The area of the State is estimated at 273 square miles. Population (1881) 36,125, or 132 persons per square mile. Of the total population, 19,859 are males and 16,266 females. Number of houses, 6757. Hindus numbered 33,291; Muhammadans, 1273; Jains, 250; and aboriginal tribes, 1311. The State contains 269 villages, and its revenue is estimated at \u00a317,500. The Chief pays tribute of \u00a31313 to Sindhia, through the Political Agent in Bhop\u00e1l. He maintains a force of 40 horse and 200 foot, and is entitled to a salute of 9 guns.\n\n**Khilchipur.**\u2014Chief town of the State of Khilchipur, under the\nBhop\u00e1l Agency of Central India. Situated on the banks of the Kali Sind river, a stone dam across which supplies water to the inhabitants. The country about the city is hilly and jungly, and sparsely cultivated. It is about 7 miles north-east from Rajgarh, and on the road from thence to Jhalra Patan, thus gaining the only trade it possesses. Population (1881) from 3000 to 5000.\n\nKhiml\u00e1s\u00e1.\u2014Town in Kurai tahsil, S\u00e1gar (Saugor) District, Central Provinces; 42 miles north-west of S\u00e1gar town. Lat. 24\u00b0 12' 30\" N., long. 78\u00b0 24' 30\" E. Population (1881) 2726, namely, Hindus, 2219; Jains, 294; Muhammadans, 212; and Kabirpanthi, 1. Number of houses, 713. A stone wall 20 feet high surrounds the town, enclosing a space of 63 acres; and the fort, which is built on high ground in the centre, occupies 5 acres. Within the fort are the police station-house and two remarkable edifices. One, a Muhammadan building, apparently the burial-place of some saint, consisted of a square structure, surmounted by a lofty dome. The dome has fallen, but the side walls remain; they are formed of enormous slabs of stone, about an inch and a half thick, cut with the most beautiful fretwork designs right through the stone, so that the pattern is visible both within and without the building. The other edifice is of Hindu origin, and was apparently a shisha mahal or glass palace. The upper of the two storeys contained an apartment fitted with mirrors, many traces of which still remain.\n\nKhiml\u00e1s\u00e1 originally belonged to a dependant of the Delhi Emperor, but was taken by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Panna in 1695, on the death of whose son without heirs in 1746, the representative of the Peshwa at S\u00e1gar occupied the fort. It was made over to the British with S\u00e1gar in 1818. From that date the town was the head-quarters of a tahsil, till in 1834 the tahsili was moved to Kurai. In July 1857, during the Mutiny, when the Bh\u00e1npur R\u00e1j\u00e1 occupied Kurai, he also seized Khiml\u00e1s\u00e1, and the town has not yet recovered from the damage done by his troops. Though the streets are narrow and irregular, the houses are generally well built, but many are still ownerless. Little trade takes place, though a market is held every Sunday. Two schools for boys and girls respectively have been established. Police station.\n\nKhindoli.\u2014Tahsil in Agra District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Khandauli.\n\nKhipra.\u2014T\u00e1luk or Sub-division in Thar and P\u00e1rkar District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; situated between 25\u00b0 26' and 26\u00b0 14' 45\" N. lat., and 69\u00b0 2' 45\" and 70\u00b0 16' E. long. Population (1881) 26,079, namely, 14,348 males and 11,731 females; number of houses, 4886. The Sub-division contains 28 villages. Hindus numbered 2722; Muhammadans, 20,279; aboriginal tribes, 2928; Sikhs, 140; Christians, 5; Jews, 4; and Jains, 1. Revenue (1881-82), \u00a36595, of which \u00a35009\nis derived from land; \u00a3667 from sayer (miscellaneous), and \u00a3319 from local sources. In 1884 the Sub-division contained 2 civil and 2 criminal courts; police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 9; regular police, 45 men.\n\n**Khipra.**\u2014Chief town in Khipra t\u00e1luk, Thar and P\u00e1rkar District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; situated on the Eastern N\u00e1ra, about 40 miles north-west of Um\u00e1rkot town. Lat. 25\u00b0 49' 30\" N., long. 69\u00b0 25' E. Population in 1881 inconsiderable. The municipal revenue in 1873\u201374 was \u00a3236, but the municipality was abolished in 1878, on the introduction into Sind of the Bombay Act vi. of 1873. Headquarters station of a mukhtiy\u00e1rk\u00e1r and tappad\u00e1r; civil and criminal court-houses; police post; dharm\u00e1s\u00e1la or rest-house. Occupation of the inhabitants principally agricultural. Manufactures consist chiefly in weaving and dyeing of cloth; local trade in cotton, wool, cocoa-nuts, metals, grain, sugar, tobacco, etc. Transit trade\u2014grain, cattle, wool, ghi, indigo, sugar, and cloth. The town is supposed to have been founded about a century ago.\n\n**Khirasra.**\u2014Petty State in the Hall\u00e1r division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 13 villages, with 1 proprietor. Estimated revenue (1881), \u00a31900. Tribute of \u00a3236, 12s. is paid to the British Government, and \u00a335 to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1gahr. Area of the estate, 13 square miles. Population (1881) 4377.\n\n**Khiron.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Dalmau tahsil, R\u00e1i Bareli District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n; on the east by Dalmau and R\u00e1i Bareli; on the south by Sareni; and on the west by Panh\u00e1n, Bhagwantnagar, Bih\u00e1r, and Patan. Population (1869) 57,102; (1881) 59,492, namely, males 29,252, and females 30,240. Hindus numbered 56,579, and Muhammadans 2913. Area, 102 square miles, or 65,097 acres. Government land revenue, \u00a39070; average rate per acre, 2s. 9\u00bdd. Of the 123 villages forming the pargan\u00e1, 79 are held under t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri tenure; 20 are zamind\u00e1ri, and 24 pattid\u00e1ri. Five market villages. Two large annual fairs. The pargan\u00e1 was originally in the possession of the Bhars, who were ousted about 700 years ago by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Abh\u00e1i Chand of the Bais clan, who annexed it to his dominions, and his descendants still form the main proprietary body. R\u00e1j\u00e1 S\u00e1tna, eighth in descent from Abh\u00e1i Chand, founded a village, calling it after his own name S\u00e1tanpur, which he also bestowed upon the whole pargan\u00e1. This arrangement continued till the time of Naw\u00e1b Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1, when the tahsild\u00e1r of the pargan\u00e1 built a fort at Khiron, which he fixed on as the seat of the tahsil, and re-named the pargan\u00e1 after it.\n\n**Khiron.**\u2014Town in Dalmau tahsil, R\u00e1i Bareli District, Oudh, and head-quarters of Khiron pargan\u00e1; situated on the road from R\u00e1i Bareli to Cawnpur, 18 miles from R\u00e1i Bareli town. Population (1881) 3083, namely, 2439 Hindus and 644 Muhammadans. The residence of one of the pargan\u00e1 t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs. Here also dwell some notable old families of\nK\u00e1yasth k\u00e1n\u00fangos. Vernacular school; weekly market. Ruined mud-built fort dating from the days of native rule.\n\nKh\u00edrp\u00e1i.\u2014Village in Midnapur District, Bengal; situated on the main road from Bardw\u00e1n to Midnapur town. Transferred, with the surrounding country, from H\u00fagl\u00ed to Midnapur in 1872. Population (1881) 6295, namely, Hindus, 6081; Muhammadans, 207; 'others,' 7. Area of town site, 1280 acres. Municipal income in 1882-83, \u00a3167; average incidence of taxation, 5s.d. per head. The town is principally inhabited by cotton-weavers, who manufacture fabrics of a superior quality, which commands a high price.\n\nKh\u00edso\u0301r (Khasor) Hills.\u2014Range in Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n District, Punjab, known also under the name of Rattah Roh or 'Red Hills;' situated between $32^\\circ 13'$ and $32^\\circ 34'$ N. lat., and between $70^\\circ 56'$ and $71^\\circ 21'$ E. long. The Indus washes their eastern base for a distance of about 25 miles, from Is\u00e1 Khel to Ch\u00fara, near Bilot, after which the chain sweeps slightly westward, parallel to the Shaikh Bud\u00edn Hills, from which it is separated by the Pani\u00e1la valley, having an average breadth of 5 miles, till it terminates at Pani\u00e1la, about 16 miles from the Indus. The extensive ruins of two ancient Hindu forts or fortified monasteries\u2014the one about 9 miles south of the mouth of the Kuram river, and the other immediately above the town of Bilot\u2014make these hills archaeologically interesting. Both of the ruins are locally called Kafir Kot, 'infidel's fort.' Bilot is also famous for its shrine of a holy Sayyid, who used to sail about the Indus in a stone boat. His descendant, known as the Makhd\u00fam of Bilot, has inherited the sanctity as well as the stone boat of his ancestor, and enjoys a j\u00e1g\u00edr worth about \u00a3250 a year.\n\nThe hills consist of miocene sandstone and conglomerate, superimposed upon jurassic and carboniferous limestone, in which fossils occur abundantly. The range is generally stony and destitute of vegetation and water. Here and there springs are to be found, their presence being usually marked by a clump of palms. The largest of these is the Garoba spring, near Kirri Khisor. Its waters run for a mile or two along a narrow ravine fringed with date-palms. These springs are generally situated too low to allow of their being utilized for irrigation. Water for cattle is also procured from some large tanks at the very top of the range, above Kirri Khisor. The hills are dotted with numerous patches of cultivated land, varying in size from one or two roods to twenty acres. These fields are embanked to receive and retain the rain water from the higher land, and sometimes form terraces one above the other. The cultivation, however, entirely depends on the rainfall, and is very uncertain. Sometimes nearly the whole of these hill fields remain waste; while in years of abundant rainfall almost the whole is cultivated, yielding very fair crops of wheat and\nb\u00e1jra. Lands at the foot of the hills watered from wells produce tobacco.\n\nThe Khisor range has a total length of about 50 miles, a breadth of 6 miles, and an elevation varying from 2000 to about 3500 feet. Its northern extremity juts into the District of Bannu.\n\n**Khol\u00e1pur.**\u2014Town in Amr\u00e1oti District, Ber\u00e1r, Deccan; 18 miles west of Amr\u00e1oti town. Lat. $20^\\circ 55' 30''$ N., long. $77^\\circ 33' 30''$ E. Population (1867) 6169; (1881) 6452, namely, 3261 males and 3191 females, of whom 4576 were Hindus, 1719 Musalm\u00e1ns, 150 Jains, and 7 Sikhs. Silk trade was once considerable. In 1809, the *subahd\u00e1r* of Ellichpur, Vithal Bh\u00e1g Deo, demanded a contribution of \u00a310,000. On payment being refused, he captured the town, which was then protected by walls; and it was sacked by his troops. Its rapid decadence may be partly attributable to the annual fights between the Musalm\u00e1ns and the R\u00e1jputs, when the victorious party always took occasion to plunder at least part of the town.\n\n**Kholpetu\u00e1.**\u2014River in Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal; an offshoot of the Kabadak near As\u00e1sun\u00ed. It first keeps a westerly course for a short distance, and, after receiving the waters of the Budh\u00e1t\u00e1 G\u00e1ng, turns to the south till it is joined by the Galghasi\u00e1, whence the united river flows through the Sundarbans till it falls again into the Kabadak, a few miles above the place where that river in its turn empties itself into the Pangasi. The Kholpetu\u00e1 is a river of little note, except for the great breadth which it assumes after it is joined by the Galghasi\u00e1, the width of the channel increasing from 150 to 600 yards in a course of 16 miles.\n\n**Khora.**\u2014Village in Khairpur State, Sind, Bombay Presidency; situated on the Abulw\u00e1ro Canal, about 20 miles from Khairpur town, and on the postal road between Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) and M\u00falt\u00e1n (Mooltan). The population is inconsiderable. There is a small manufacture of coarse cotton cloth.\n\n**Khosh\u00e1b.**\u2014Tahsil and town in Sh\u00e1hpur District, Punjab.\u2014See KHUSHAB.\n\n**Khud\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Ruined town in Dadu *\u00faluk*, Sehw\u00e1n Sub-division, Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; 16 miles north-east of Sehw\u00e1n, and 8 miles south-west of Dadu. Lat. $26^\\circ 38' 35''$ N., long. $67^\\circ 44' 30''$ E. With regard to this place, Thornton says: 'Little more than thirty years ago it rivalled Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d in size and population, yet now not one habitable dwelling remains. It was a favourite residence of the Talpur chiefs of Sind, and the remains of many of them rest here in tombs of neat but plain construction.'\n\n**Kh\u00fadi\u00e1n.**\u2014Town in Chuni\u00e1n tahsil, Lahore District, Punjab; situated on the road from Firozpur to Mult\u00e1n. Lat. $30^\\circ 59' 30''$ N., long. $74^\\circ 19' 15''$ E. Population (1869) 3108; (1881) 2917, namely, Muhammadans, 1694; Hindus, 1071; and Sikhs, 152. Number of\nhouses, 607. Municipal income (1882-83), \u00a3120, or an average taxation of 9\u00bdd. per head. It is an old town, but of no present importance; surrounded by a brick wall, with well-built houses of burnt brick, and several large residences. The Katora Inundation Canal passes close to the town on the south. School and police station.\n\nKh\u00fajji.\u2014Zamindari estate in Dr\u00fag tahsil, R\u00e1ipur District, Central Provinces; 70 miles south-west of R\u00e1ipur town. Kh\u00fajji village is situated in lat. 21\u00b0 57' N., long. 81\u00b0 57' 30\" E. Area of the estate, 71 square miles; number of villages, 32; occupied houses, 3459. Population (1881) 11,309, namely, males 5616, and females 5693; average density, 159 persons per square mile. The estate is at present (1883) under Government management, the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r, a Muhammadan, being a minor.\n\nKhuln\u00e1.\u2014A British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between 21\u00b0 38' and 23\u00b0 1' N. lat., and between 88\u00b0 55' and 89\u00b0 59' E. long. Khuln\u00e1 District forms the south-eastern portion of the Presidency Division. It is bounded on the north by Jess\u00f3r District, on the east by B\u00e1karganj District, on the south by the Sundarbans, and on the west by the Twenty-four Parganas. Area, exclusive of the unsurveyed Sundarbans, 2077 square miles. Population, according to the Census of 1881, 1,079,948 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Khuln\u00e1, which is the terminus of the Bengal Central Railway.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Khuln\u00e1 occupies the southern central portion of the Delta between the H\u00fagl\u00ed and the united Ganges and Brahmaputra. Its general shape is much the same as that of the Twenty-four Parganas, an irregular parallelogram. It is an alluvial plain, intersected by rivers, which again are interlaced by cross-channels and marshes. The District may be divided into three parts: the north-western portion, where the land is well raised; the north-eastern portion, from the boundary-line between Jess\u00f3r and Khuln\u00e1, down to the latitude of B\u00e1gherh\u00e1t, where the land is low and covered with swamps; and the southern portion, which forms the Khuln\u00e1 Sundarbans, a mere tangled network of swamps and rivers, in the interstices of which (except where reclamation has been going on) tillage is impossible, and there is no settled population.\n\nThe north-west of Khuln\u00e1 District is beautified with extensive groves of date-palms and plantations, especially on the outskirts of villages. Indeed, nearly every village lies within its own fringe of plantations and garden-ground. The produce of the date trees is boiled down into gur or molasses by the cultivators, and sold to refiners for the purpose of being manufactured into sugar. In the north-east portion of the District the population is sparse, the only parts of the tract suitable for dwellings being the high land along the\nbanks of rivers. The principal rivers of Khuln\u00e1 are the Madhumati (which forms the eastern boundary of the District), with its tributary the Bhairab, on the banks of which is situated the town of Khuln\u00e1; the Kabadak, the Bhadra, the Ath\u00e1rabank\u00e1, the Jamun\u00e1 or Ichhamat\u00ed, the Galgh\u00e1s\u00ed\u00e1 or B\u00e1nst\u00e1l\u00e1, and the Sibs\u00e1. As in all deltaic tracts, the banks of the rivers are higher than the adjacent country; but a great part of the District is spread out into large marshes.\n\nHistory.\u2014The history of Khuln\u00e1 District is much the same as the history of Jess\u00f3r, as more than two-thirds of it is formed of what were formerly Sub-divisions of the District of Jess\u00f3r. Khuln\u00e1 was erected into a separate District on the 1st June 1882.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of Khuln\u00e1, as ascertained by the Census of 1881, is 1,079,948 persons, inhabiting 2,890 villages or townships, and 156,223 houses. The average pressure of the population on the soil throughout the surveyed portion of the District is 519'96 to the square mile; number of houses per square mile, 77'03; persons per house, 6'91. The density of the population varies, however, in a most marked way in different parts of the District. After what has been said above in connection with the physical aspects of the three different portions into which Khuln\u00e1 may be divided, it will be readily understood that the population may be expected to be more sparse towards the south of the District than in the north-west and north-east.\n\nOf the total population, 568,402 are males and 511,546 females; proportion of males, 52'63 per cent. Classified according to age, there are, under twelve years old\u2014males 183,167, and females 173,414; total children, 356,581, or 33'01 per cent. As regards religious distinctions, Hindus number 523,657, or 48'48 per cent. of the total population, while Musalm\u00e1ns number 555,544, or 51'44 per cent., chiefly belonging to the lower classes. The number of Christians is 747, of whom 723 are native converts. Of the higher castes of Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans number 28,654, and R\u00e1jputs 551. Of the lower ranks of the Hindu community, the fishing and boating castes deserve special mention. The fisheries in the rivers and deeper swamps are very valuable, and the right to fish is a regular tenure, paid for like the right to cultivate land.\n\nTowns and Villages.\u2014There are, in Khuln\u00e1, according to the Census of 1881, four towns with a population of over 5000 souls, viz. Satkhira, 8738; Kalamosa, 5995; Kaliganj, 5554; and Debhata, 5514; and there are three municipalities in the District, at S\u00e1tkhir\u00e1, Debh\u00e1t\u00e1, and Chandoni\u00e1. There are 160 towns containing from 1000 to 5000 inhabitants, of which 138 contain fewer than 2000; 2266 villages with fewer than 500; and 460 with between 500 and 1000 inhabitants. Among the towns or large villages which, though con-\ntaining fewer than 5000 inhabitants, are important commercially or otherwise, may be mentioned the following:\u2014Khuln\u00e1, the 'capital of the Sundarbans,' a town of commercial importance, and the civil station of the District, past which the whole boat traffic of the east and north-east passes on its way to Calcutta; Kapilmuni, a market and place of pilgrimage; B\u00e1gherh\u00e1t, with the celebrated shat-gumbaz or sixty-domed mosque, and many other interesting ruins connected with Kh\u00e1n Jahan, one of the earliest reclaimers of the Sundarbans; Morrellganj on the P\u00e1ng\u00e1ch\u00ed, lately the property of Messrs. Morrell and Lightfoot; and S\u00e1tkhir\u00e1, which contains many Hindu temples. Descriptions of most of these places will be found in their alphabetical order in this work, and a detailed account of them is given in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. ii. pp. 201-239.\n\nOccupations.\u2014As regards occupation, the Census Report of 1881 classifies the male population into the following six main divisions:\u2014(1) Professional class, including all Government officials and the professions, 10,786; (2) domestic servants, innkeepers, etc., 7068; (3) commercial classes, including bankers, merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 31,666; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 253,622; (5) industrial class, including manufacturers and artisans, 63,204; (6) indefinite and unspecified class, comprising general labourers and male children, 202,056.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014As in Jessore, the staple crop in the District of Khuln\u00e1 is rice, of which there are three harvests, \u00e1man, \u00e1us, and boro. The times of sowing and reaping vary in different parts of the District, as in Jessore. In the north-west portion of Khuln\u00e1, \u00e1man or winter rice is sown in April and May, and reaped in November or December; in the Sundarbans, it is sown in April and reaped in January. The land for this crop is ploughed four times before sowing, and, except in marsh lands, the young shoots are transplanted in July. For \u00e1us rice the ground is ploughed five or six times, the seed is sown on higher ground, there is no transplanting, and the lands yield a second crop. Boro rice is hardly ploughed at all; the seed is scattered broadcast in the marshes as they dry up, and the shoots are transplanted when a month old, and sometimes again a month later. Among the other crops of the District are peas, jute, sugar-cane, date palms, etc. The land tenures of the District deserve special notice. The possessors of Sundarbans grants are called t\u00e1luhdd\u00e1s. Several of them hold considerable estates in Jessore, B\u00e1karganj, or the Twenty-four Parganas; but many are residents in the portion of this District immediately north of the Sundarbans. These are men who, being in comfortable circumstances, have money enough to carry on Sundarban reclamation with success, although they cannot afford to leave the business in the hands of agents. They are therefore immediately interested in\nthe reclamation scheme, and to them is due much of the agricultural improvements and extension since the Permanent Settlement. Rates of rent vary in Khuln\u00e1, as in Jessor, according to the description and position of the land.\n\nNational Calamities.\u2014Bights occur occasionally, but rarely to any serious extent. The District is, as might be expected, subject to heavy floods, which have sometimes been immediately followed by disastrous cyclones.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The trade of Khuln\u00e1 is carried on by means of permanent markets. The chief exports are sugar, both dhulna (half-refined) and paka (white granular), indigo, rice, etc., and from the Sundarbans, timber, honey, shells, etc. The principal imports are salt, English piece-goods, and hardware. The exports greatly exceed the imports in value.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Khuln\u00e1 was formerly a Sub-division of Jessor District, but now, with the addition of two more Sub-divisions, it forms a District of itself. With the view of lightening the work in the great suburban District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, and of partially relieving Nadiy\u00e1 and Jessor of the charges which pressed so heavily on them, the local Government, after long and careful inquiry, came to the conclusion that the formation of a Sundarbans District with its head-quarters at Khuln\u00e1 was absolutely necessary. The advantages of having the head-quarters at the Khuln\u00e1 terminus of the new Bengal Central Railway are many; and the same grounds which rendered it desirable that the Sundarbans should be connected by railway communication with Calcutta, pointed conclusively to the choice of Khuln\u00e1 as the head-quarters of the new District. The sanction of the Government of India and of the Secretary of State having been obtained to the formation of the new District in the Sundarbans, which the local Government considered should be formed, a notification, dated the 25th April 1882, which took effect from the 1st June of the same year, declared that it should consist of the S\u00e1tkhir\u00e1 Sub-division of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, and of the Khuln\u00e1 and B\u00e1gherh\u00e1t Sub-divisions of Jessor District, the head-quarters being at the town of Khuln\u00e1. Jessor District, thus relieved of two Sub-divisions, is in a position to take one from Nadiy\u00e1, which District stands in need of relief. The B\u00e1ng\u00e1on Sub-division of Nadiy\u00e1 is accordingly to be transferred to Jessor, of which District indeed it geographically forms a part. The effect of these changes is that each of the three Districts of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Nadiy\u00e1, and Jessor will be relieved of one Sub-division, and will be reduced to more manageable proportions in regard to area and population.\n\nThe additional establishment which has been provided for Khuln\u00e1, exclusive of the usual ministerial establishments, is a Magistrate and\nCollector, a Joint-Magistrate, a Civil Surgeon, and a District Superintendent of Police. Beyond the appointment of a subordinate Judge, no increase in the judicial establishment is necessary, as the Judge of Jessor will hold sessions at Khuln\u00e1, and, with the aid of the subordinate Judge newly appointed, and the munisif, dispose of the civil work of the District. For police purposes Khuln\u00e1 is divided into 13 than\u00e1s or police circles, with 11 outposts and 1 salt pass-station. The District police consists of 303 men, of all ranks. There is one District jail in Khuln\u00e1 and two subsidiary jails.\n\nMedical Aspects\u2014Climate.\u2014The seasons are substantially the same as in other Districts of Lower Bengal; but the climate is marked by a comparative absence of cold weather during the winter months, throughout which heavy night dews prevail, and by a cool breeze during the rainy season from the south-east. During the year the thermometer ranges from $56^\\circ$ to $98^\\circ$ F. The rainfall during the year 1882 at the town of Khuln\u00e1 was returned at 67.02 inches.\n\nDiseases.\u2014As in the neighbouring Districts, intermittent and other classes of fever are prevalent throughout the year, owing to the extreme dampness of the District. The people living on the borders of the Sundarbans, and those at a distance, suffer alike from this cause; the country in the immediate neighbourhood of the head-quarters of the S\u00e1tkhir\u00e1 Sub-division being apparently the most unhealthy. Cholera is scarcely ever absent, being most severe at the commencement of the cold season. The total number of deaths reported to have occurred from cholera during 1882 was 2830, of which 1538 happened during the last quarter of the year. Small-pox is now almost unknown. Cattle disease prevails at times, chiefly in the Sundarban tracts of the B\u00e1gherh\u00e1t Sub-division. The cattle required for cultivation in those parts are carried backwards and forwards in crowded boats; and from want of proper accommodation, both in their transit and on shore, it is not surprising that some disease among them occurs.\n\nMedical Institutions.\u2014There are public charitable dispensaries, containing accommodation for in-door patients, supported by voluntary contributions, at the head-quarters of each of the Sub-divisions of Khuln\u00e1, S\u00e1tkhir\u00e1, and B\u00e1gherh\u00e1t, in charge of native hospital assistants; and also one at Morrellganj, supported by the owners of that estate; one at Daulatpur, 6 miles from Khuln\u00e1, supported from the funds of the Sayyidpur trust estate (the Mohsin Fund), of which a considerable portion lies in this District; and one at Sy\u00e1mnagar in the Sub-division of S\u00e1tkhir\u00e1, maintained by the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r of Nokipur. The total number of persons who received out-door medical relief in the year 1882 was about 8000.\n\nKhuln\u00e1.\u2014Head-quarters Sub-division of Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated between $21^\\circ 41' 45''$ and $23^\\circ 1' N.$ lat., and between $89^\\circ 12' 30''$.\nand $89^\\circ 47' 15\"$ E. long. Area (1881), 696 square miles; with 886 villages or towns, and 47,480 houses. Population (1872) 324,001; (1881) 344,389, showing an increase of 20,388, or 6.29 per cent., in nine years. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 169,960, or 49.4 per cent.; Muhammadans, 174,267, or 50.6 per cent.; and Christians, 162; total, 344,389, namely, 180,994 males and 163,395 females. Proportion of males, 52.6 per cent.; density of population, 495 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 1.27; persons per village, 389; houses per square mile, 54; persons per house, 7.1. This Sub-division, which was constituted in 1842, comprises the 4 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of Khuln\u00e1, Bait\u00e1gh\u00e1t\u00e1, Damuri\u00e1, and P\u00e1ikg\u00e1chha. In 1883 it contained 4 civil and 5 criminal courts, a regular police force of 151 men, besides 575 village watchmen.\n\nKhuln\u00e1.\u2014Administrative head-quarters of Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated at the point where the Bhairab river meets the Sundarbans. Lat. $22^\\circ 49' 10\"$ N., long. $89^\\circ 36' 55\"$ E. Khuln\u00e1 may be described as the capital of the Sundarbans; and for the last hundred years at least it has been a place of considerable importance. It was the headquarters of the salt department during the period of the Company's salt manufacture. The whole boat traffic from the east and north-east passes here on its way to Calcutta: rice from Dacca and B\u00e1karganj; lime, lemons, and oranges from Sylhet; mustard seed, linseed, and pulse from Pabn\u00e1, R\u00e1jsh\u00e1h\u00ed, and Far\u00eddpur; clarified butter (gh\u00ed) from Patn\u00e1; and firewood from the Sundarbans. From Calcutta, the principal cargo is Liverpool salt, the trade in which is very considerable. Numerous sugar refineries exist. It contains three market-places, of which the most important, Sen's B\u00e1z\u00e1r, is situated on the east and the other two on the west bank of the river.

The port is five miles east of Dholer\u00e1, on the Bh\u00e1dar or Dholer\u00e1 creek. Dholera town and the port of Khun were once connected by a tramway, which has now ceased to run. The lighthouse is at the entrance of the creek, in lat. $22^\\circ 3' 20\"$ N., and long. $72^\\circ 17' 30\"$ E. It is provided with a common lantern with five oil burners and reflectors fixed on a conical building on wooden piles. The lantern is 50 feet above high-water, and visible for 15 miles.\n\nKh\u00fand (or Kund).\u2014Valley in Kashmir State, Punjab, on the northern side of the P\u00edr-Panj\u00e1l Mountain. Lat. $33^\\circ 32'$ N., long. $75^\\circ 10'$ E. Thornton describes it as three miles long, picturesque, well cultivated, and possessing a cool climate.

This Sub-division comprises the 2 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of Khurdh\u00e1 and B\u00e1npur. It contained in 1883, 3 courts, with a regular police force of 114 officers and men, and a rural police or village watch numbering 407.\n\nThe estate or little principality of Khurdh\u00e1 formed the last portion of territory held by the independent Hindu dynasty of Orissa. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 cavalry were unable to overrun this jungle-covered and hilly tract; and the ancient royal house retained much of its independence until 1804, when the R\u00e1j\u00e1 rebelled against the British Government, and his territory was confiscated. A rising on the part of the peasantry took place in 1817\u201318, arising in great measure through the oppression of underling Bengali officials. The insurrection was speedily quelled, reforms were introduced, and grievances redressed. At the present day Khurdh\u00e1 is a profitable and well-managed Government estate, and the cultivators are a contented and generally prosperous class. Since 1804, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 has possessed no independent powers, but he was held in great veneration by the people as the hereditary guardian of the Jagann\u00e1th temple. The late holder of the title was convicted of wilful murder in 1878, and sentenced to penal servitude in the Andaman Islands.\n\nKhurdh\u00e1.\u2014Town in Pur\u00ed District, Orissa, and head-quarters of Khurdh\u00e1 Sub-division and police circle (th\u00e1n\u00ed); situated on the high road from Cuttack to Ganj\u00e1m in Madras.

The principal inhabitants are Keshgi Path\u00e1ns and Chur\u00faw\u00e1l Baniy\u00e1s; the latter, who are Jains by religion, are an enterprising and a wealthy class, carrying on banking over all India by means of paid agencies. They have recently built a handsome temple in the centre of the town, with a lofty dome surmounted by a gilded pinnacle. The interior is one blaze of gold and colour; the vault of the dome being painted and ornamented in the most florid style of Hindu decorative art. Among the recent improvements in the town are a fine masonry tank, 200 feet square, supplied with water from the Ganges Canal; and a market-place with handsome fa\u00e7ades, a lofty gateway, a mosque in the centre of the square, and an adjoining b\u00e1z\u00e1r, all pointed with carved stone. The cost of the tank and aqueduct was about \u00a31200; that of the market-place nearly \u00a310,000. Tahs\u00edli, police station, post-office, dispensary, town hall, tahs\u00edli school.

Total population (1881) 122,633, namely, males 64,585, and females 58,048; average density, 119 persons per square mile. Of the 239 towns and villages, 168 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; 46 from five hundred to a thousand; 23 from one to two thousand; while two towns (Shahpur and Shahiwal) have between five and ten thousand. Classified according to religion, the population in 1881 consisted of\u2014Muhammadans, 101,831; Hindus, 19,304; Sikhs, 1481; and Christians, 17. Of the total area of 660,615 acres, 182,047 acres were returned in the quinquennial agricultural statistics of the Punjab Government as under cultivation in 1878-79, of which 175,957 acres were irrigated (9189 acres from Government works, and 166,768 acres by private individuals). The uncultivated area included 274,192 acres of grazing lands, 190,950 acres of cultivable land available for tillage, and 13,426 acres of uncultivable waste. The principal crops are wheat, jowar, bajra, gram, and barley. Poppy is also grown to a considerable extent. Revenue, \u00a314,432. The administrative staff consists of a tahsildar, presiding over 1 civil and 1 criminal court.

A canal 14 miles long, the Corbyn-wah, has\nbeen cut from the Jehlam river, which affords irrigation to a large tract of country, and supplies the town of Khush\u00e1b with good water. This canal will fertilize a barren tract of country. The principal official buildings comprise a town hall, tahs\u00edli, school, dispensary.\n\n**Khut\u00e1han.** \u2014 Northern tahs\u00edl of Jaunpur District, North-Western Provinces, comprising the pargan\u00e1s of Ungli, R\u00e1ri, Badl\u00e1pur, Kary\u00e1t-Mendha, and Chandah.

In former times, smelting operations were conducted on a large scale, as evidenced by the deep excavations and large heaps of slag. The greater part of the smelted iron used to be exported to the plains in lumps or bars, and was more highly valued than English iron by native smiths. Under the competition of the cheaper article from England, this trade has now died out; but at the present day, iron implements, such as d\u00e3os or hill-knives, kodalis or mattocks, hammers, crow-bars, and wedges, are still manufactured and exported to Sylhet. Other manufactures are the weaving of cotton and eria silk cloth, and the making of mats and baskets. The cultivated crops are rice, millet, cotton, potatoes, oranges, chillies, betel-nut, and p\u00e1n leaves. The wild products gathered in the jungle include caoutchouc, cinnamon, lac, black pepper, and honey.\n\nKi\u00e1m\u00e1ri.\u2014Island on the further side of Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) harbour, Kar\u00e1chi District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; lying in lat. 24\u00b0 49' 15\" N., and long. 67\u00b0 2' E., and forming one of the municipal quarters of Kar\u00e1chi Town, with which it is connected by a road called the 'Napier Mole,' 3 miles long, constructed in 1854.

Two of the temples at Kiching are still visited by pilgrims, and are kept in some repair. The surrounding jungle is thickly scattered with fragments of elaborately sculptured idols, and human figures in alto-relievo. The two temples are said to have formed part of a series of 60 similar ones, placed 2 miles apart in a circle 40 miles in diameter, of which only these and some others at Udaipur on the Baitaran\u00ed are now visited.\nKidderpur.\u2014Village on the left bank of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, immediately south of Calcutta, in the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal.

Rice is cultivated along the narrow valleys of the hill streams. The whole area is mountainous, being traversed by spurs of the Brahmagiri range, which abound in simbhar deer, and are the favourite resort of sportsmen. Coffee estates have been opened out on the rich black soil of the northern portion of the t\u00e1luk, which is traversed by the Mysore-Cannanore road. Another road leads from Gonikopal to the Wyn\u00e1d.

Each estate consists of two distinct divisions, a lowland and an upland tract; the former held as an ordinary zamind\u00e1ri under the regular District officers, while the latter is under the supervision of a special Government Agency.\n\nParl\u00e1 Kimedi is the largest zamind\u00e1ri in the District. It contains an area of 410 square miles, exclusive of about 354 square miles of M\u00e1livas or hill country. Population of lowland tract (1871) 227,482; (1881) 240,980, namely, 120,487 males and 120,493 females; villages, 723; houses, 50,708. Hindus numbered 240,266; Muhammadans, 497; Christians, 118; and 'others,' 99. In 1881 the M\u00e1livas contained 342 villages, with a population of 39,152, namely, 20,218 males and 18,934 females, occupying 8936 houses. Hindus numbered 38,952, chiefly Savars; and Muhammadans, 200. The peshkash, or permanent assessment, of Parl\u00e1 Kimedi is \u00a38783. The estate yields an annual revenue of \u00a345,318 to the zamind\u00e1r.\nPedda Kimedi, which is situated north of Parl\u00e1 Kimedi, pays a peshkash of \u00a32332, and yields an annual revenue of \u00a310,087. The Census returns of 1881 do not show the figures of Pedda Kimedi zamindar\u00ed; those of 1871 gave the area as 195 square miles; villages, 194; population, 40,650. In 1881, the M\u00e1l\u00edyas or hill tract of Pedda Kimedi contained 260 villages, with a population of 26,605, namely, 13,665 males and 12,940 females, occupying 5416 houses. Hindus numbered 26,563, mostly Kandhs; Muhammadans, 41; and Christian, 1. Area, about 377 square miles.\n\nChinna Kimedi, the most northern division, pays a peshkash of \u00a31994, and yields an annual revenue of \u00a311,641. Area of lowlands, 56 square miles, with 131 villages, containing 6665 houses. Population (1871) 28,491; (1881) 35,954, namely, 17,851 males and 18,103 females. Hindus numbered 35,926; and Muhammadans, 28. The extensive M\u00e1l\u00edyas (about 1975 square miles) attached to Chinna Kimedi have been resumed by the British Government, and their ancient feudal connection with the zamindar has ceased. In 1881, these M\u00e1l\u00edyas contained 138 villages, with a population of 11,849, namely, 6254 males and 5595 females, occupying 2671 houses. Hindus numbered 11,835, principally Kandhs; Muhammadans, 11; and Christians, 3.\n\nThe whole Kimedi country was ruled from a remote date by a descendant of the royal house of Orissa. In 1607, the then Kimedi R\u00e1j\u00e1 allotted Vizian\u00e1gram and Prat\u00e1pgiri to his younger son Unanga Bh\u00edma Deo Kes\u00e1ri, whose descendants divided the estate into two zamindar\u00eds, which were temporarily reunited under Bh\u00edma Deo, who proved very troublesome to the British Resident. Troops were sent against him in 1769, and his fort at Karla was taken. The following year, in consequence of his suspected intrigues with S\u00edt\u00e1r\u00e1ma R\u00e1zu (of Vizian\u00e1gram in Vizagapatam District) and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Prat\u00e1pgiri, his principal stronghold, was seized. On this, the old R\u00e1j\u00e1 accepted the terms offered him; but in 1772 it was again found necessary to enter the country. After a hard-fought contest, the British gained possession of all his forts, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 had to submit to strict conditions, including the partition of his estate between his two sons. This arrangement was fraught with most disastrous consequences to the country, for it led to internecine struggles, lasting for a quarter of a century. The brothers ravaged one another's territory, and burnt one another's villages, till in 1800 they were both thrown into jail in Ganj\u00e1m for disturbing the peace. They were replaced by their respective sons, who carried on the feud; and until very recently, although open hostilities were impossible, the feeling of hatred continued. The country is now peaceful and flourishing, and connected by road with\nthe coast. The principal towns are Parl\u00e1 Kimedi, Digupadi, and Pudamari.\n\n**Kimiri\u00e1.**\u2014A deltaic distributary of the Br\u00e1hmani river, Cuttack District, Orissa, which branches off opposite the village of Rajendrapur, and, after receiving the waters of the Genguti, Kelo, and Birupa, falls again into the parent stream at the village of Indpur.\n\n**Kimlia.**\u2014Pass in Bashahr State, Punjab, over the outer Himalayan range, bounding Kunaw\u00e1r to the north. Lat. $31^\\circ 14' N.$, long. $78^\\circ 28'$. Thornton states that it can be crossed only during the months of May, June, and July; later in the year, the snow becomes treacherous, swallowing pack-sheep and goats, with their drivers. Elevation above sea-level, about 17,000 feet.\n\n**Kinhi.**\u2014Zamind\u00e1ri estate in B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t District, Central Provinces; comprising 64 villages, on an area of 159 square miles, partly above and partly below the hills. Kinhi, the chief village, is situated in lat. $21^\\circ 37' N.$, and long. $80^\\circ 29' E.$, 25 miles south-east of B\u00farha. The present chiefs trace their descent from the head herdsman of the Gond and Bhonsla kings of N\u00e1gpur, who tended the royal flocks on the upland pastures of L\u00e1nj\u00ed. Since the estate was divided into eight shares, its value has greatly decreased.\n\n**Kin-rwa.**\u2014Village in the Kin-rwa revenue circle, Shwe-gyin District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. Government rest-house; small police force. Population (1877) 1349; (1881) 1107, chiefly engaged in orchard cultivation. Number of houses, 211. Prior to annexation, a small Burmese military force was stationed here. The word 'Keng' or 'Kin' means a military station. The termination rwa is simply 'village.'\n\n**Kir\u00e1kat** (*Kardkat*).\u2014Eastern tahsil of Jaunpur District, North-Western Provinces, lying on either side of the river G\u00famti, and comprising the pargan\u00e1s of Chandwak, Dary\u00e1pur, Pis\u00e1ra, and Gujara.

In the south-east of the tahsil are wide tracts of uncultivable \u00fasar plains, and glass is largely produced from the saline efflorescence (*reh*) which covers them. There are no lakes in the tahsil. Water is found at a depth of from 28 to 40 feet, and wells and tanks are numerous. The Grand Trunk Road from Azamgarh to Benares passes through the east of the tahsil from north to south, and several other roads afford communication with Kir\u00e1kat, the headquarters town. Total area, according to the latest official report (1881), 171 square miles, of which 120\u00b76 square miles are cultivated, 34\u00b77 square miles cultivable, and 15\u00b77 square miles barren.

There were no towns containing more than five thousand inhabitants. Of the total population, 2557 are returned as landholders, 27,068 as agriculturists, and 12,610 as engaged in occupations other than agriculture. The majority of the cultivators belong to the R\u00e1jput, Koer\u00ed, Ah\u00edr, and Cham\u00e1r castes. In 1884 the tahsil contained 2 criminal courts, 2 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), a regular police force of 36 men, and a village watch of 187 chaukid\u00e1rs.\n\nKir\u00e1kat.\u2014Town in Jaunpur District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Kir\u00e1kat tahsil.

A small municipal revenue for police and conservancy purposes is raised by means of a house-tax. The town was founded about the year 1450, in the reign of Bahlol Lodi; and the ruins of the old castle or fort still exist, though fast falling to decay. Walls of great strength are yet standing on either side of the main gateway, within which is a handsome and well-preserved mosque. K\u00edratpur is now merely an agricultural centre, of purely local importance, with a petty manufacture of lacquered wooden work.\n\nKirki (Kirkee or Khakdi).\u2014Town and cantonment in the Haveli Sub-division of Poona (P\u00fana) District, Bombay Presidency.

Population (1881) 12,667, namely, males 6214, and females 6453; residing in 29 villages, on an area of 40 square miles, and inhabiting 2751 houses. Conferred in 1828 upon Ch\u00edm\u00e1 Patel, the once powerful possessor of K\u00e1mtha and the surrounding tal\u00faks. Kirn\u00e1pur, the principal town, and residence of the chief, stands on high ground, in lat. $21^\\circ 39'$ N., and long. $80^\\circ 22'$ E., 16 miles south-east of B\u00farha, and contains some ancient temples. It has a good Government school, and a police outpost, and the District post to L\u00e1nji passes daily.\n\nKirran (or S\u00e1ki).\u2014River in Gurd\u00e1sipur and Amritsar (Umritsar) Districts, Punjab; rises in lat. $32^\\circ 8'$ N., and long. $75^\\circ 30'$ E., in the extensive swamps of Bahrampur, west of D\u00ednanagar in the former District, and runs parallel with the R\u00e1vi until it passes into Amritsar. It flows past the towns of R\u00e1md\u00e1s and Ajn\u00e1la, and joins the R\u00e1vi in lat. $31^\\circ 45'$ N., and long. $74^\\circ 37'$ E., near the village of Mirow\u00e1l, just above the bridge of boats on the Amritsar and Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la road.

Few trees, no b\u00e1z\u00e1r, unmade and broken roadways, damp situation, defective sanitary arrangements. Inhabitants suffer from enlarged spleen and other malarious diseases.\n\nKirtin\u00e1s\u00e1.\u2014River in Dacca District, Bengal; one of the main channels by which the Ganges now finds its way into the Meghn\u00e1.\nIn Rennel's map of the last century, the Ganges is shown as joining the Meghn\u00e1 at Mehndiganj, considerably to the south of the Kirtin\u00e1s\u00e1. But the Kirtin\u00e1s\u00e1 is now the principal channel of the Ganges, branching off near R\u00e1jnagar, and falling into the Meghn\u00e1, in lat. $23^\\circ 14' \\text{N.}$, and long. $90^\\circ 37' \\text{E.}$, near K\u00e1rtikpur. The Kirtin\u00e1s\u00e1 has a width of from 3 to 4 miles, with a strong current, which renders navigation difficult during the rains. The original bed of the Ganges is now almost dry in the hot season.\n\n**Kishangarh (Krishnagarh).**\u2014Native State under the political superintendence of the Eastern States Agency of R\u00e1jput\u00e1n\u00e1; situated between lat. $26^\\circ 17'$ and $26^\\circ 50' \\text{N.}$, long. $74^\\circ 43'$ and $75^\\circ 13' \\text{E.}$ The area is 724 square miles, and the population in 1881 was returned at 112,633, namely, 59,098 males and 53,535 females; dwelling in 3 towns and 210 villages, and occupying 24,928 houses. Persons per square mile, 155.5; per house, 4.5. Hindus numbered 97,846; Muhammadans, 8492; and Jains, 6295.

Divided into their tribes, the Muhammadans are thus returned\u2014Path\u00e1ns, 1308; Sayyids, 265; and 'others,' 6919. The Census distributes the adult male population into the following groups as regards occupation\u2014Agriculture, 13,436; day-labour, 4946; handicraft, 5396; service, 5038; miscellaneous, 4630; and no occupation, 3034: total, 36,480. The principal towns are KISHANGARH (the capital), RUPNAGAR, and SARWAR.\n\n**History.**\u2014The founder of the State was Kishan Singh, the second son of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Udai Singh of Jodhpur, who, leaving his patrimony, conquered the tract of country which now comprises Kishangarh, and became its ruler under the sign-manual of the Emperor Akbar in 1594. There is little of importance known regarding the affairs of the State until 1818, when a treaty was entered into by the British Government with Kishangarh, together with the other R\u00e1jput States, as part of a general scheme for the suppression of the Pind\u00e1ri marauders, by whom the country was at that time overrun. This treaty contains the usual conditions of protection on the part of the British Government, and subordinate co-operation and abstinence from political correspondence on the part of the chief.\n\nThe Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Kaly\u00e1n Singh, who was supposed to be insane, soon became involved in troubles with his nobles, which eventually resulted in his flight to Delhi. Affairs grew worse at Kishangarh, and British territory having been violated by the disputants, the leaders of both parties were called upon to desist from hostilities, and to refer their grievances to the mediation of the Government of India. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja was at the same time warned that, if he did not return to his capital and interest him-\nself in the affairs of the State, the treaty with him would be abrogated and engagements formed with the insurgent Thakurs. This threat brought the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 back to Kishangarh, but, finding himself unable to govern the State, he offered to lease it to Government. His offer was refused. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 on this took up his residence at Ajmere. The nobles then proclaimed the heir-apparent as Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, and laid siege to the capital, which they were on the point of carrying when Kaly\u00e1n Singh accepted the mediation of the Political Agent, through whom matters were for the time adjusted.\n\nThe reconciliation, however, did not prove sincere, and Kaly\u00e1n Singh shortly afterwards abdicated in favour of his son, Makhd\u00fam Singh, by whom the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, Dhir\u00e1j Prithwi Singh Bah\u00e1dur, was adopted. Prithwi Singh succeeded in 1840; and the administration, which was under his personal guidance, was conducted with prudence, and more than average ability. He died on the 25th December 1879, leaving three sons, and was succeeded by the eldest, the present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 S\u00e1dul Singh, who was born about 1854. The chief possesses the right of adoption, and is entitled to a salute of 15 guns.\n\nRevenue, Agriculture, etc.\u2014The produce of the State consists mainly of cereals. Its revenue in 1881 was \u00a327,511. The customs receipts, which formed a large portion of the revenue, were chiefly derived from the S\u00e1mbhar lake salt traffic. These receipts, however, owing to the introduction of railway communication into R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, and the abandonment of duty on all through traffic, having become greatly diminished, the Government of India agreed to compensate the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 by a money payment of \u00a32000 per annum. The R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway, constructed on the metre gauge, passes through the northern portion of the State. The Nas\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d-Deoli road also traverses the State.\n\nKishangarh pays no tribute, and contributes nothing to any local corps or contingent. The military force consists of 550 cavalry, 3500 infantry, 36 guns, and 100 artillerymen.\n\nKishangarh.\u2014Chief town of the State of Kishangarh, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, and a station on the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 State Railway; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 35' N., and long. 74\u00b0 55' E., about 21 miles north-east of Nasirabad (Nusseer\u00e1b\u00e1d). Population (1881) 14,824, namely, 7513 males and 7311 females. Hindus number 9760; Muhammadans, 3140; and 'others,' 1924.\n\nThe town and fort of Kishangarh occupy a picturesque position on the banks of a small lake, called G\u00fandol\u00e1o, in the centre of which is the Muhkum Bil\u00e1s, or Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1's summer garden. The principal temples in the town are Brijr\u00e1j-j\u00ed-k\u00e1-Mand\u00edr, and those dedicated to Mohan L\u00e1l J\u00ed, Madan Mohan J\u00ed, Narsingh J\u00ed, and Chint\u00e1m\u00e1n J\u00ed. At Sal\u00edm\u00e1b\u00e1d, about 12 miles from Kishangarh, is a temple known as Nim Marag Samparda, which is an object of pilgrimage at all seasons to the natives of the surrounding districts.\nThe town contains a number of banking houses, and the principal industrial occupations of the people are the manufacture of cloth, the cutting of precious stones, and the manufacture of drinking vessels of khas-khas. There is a post-office, a dharms\u00e1l\u00e1 for the reception of native travellers, and a staging bungalow near the railway station, outside of the city; but European visitors are usually accommodated in the Ph\u00fal-Mahal, a garden-house belonging to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, on the borders of the lake immediately below the palace. This last building is the highest and most conspicuous part of the fort, and commands a magnificent view over the surrounding country. An Anglo-vernacular school, founded by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 in 1882, is largely attended.\n\n**Kishenganj** (properly, Krishnaganj).\u2014Village and head-quarters of a police circle (th\u00e1n\u00e1) in Bh\u00e1galpur District, Bengal; situated 33 miles north of Bh\u00e1galpur town.

In 1883 it contained a Deputy Magistrate and Collector's court, and 2 muns\u00edf's courts, a regular police of 72 men, besides a village watch of 947.\n\n**Kisoriganj.**\u2014Town, municipality and head-quarters of Kisoriganj Sub-division and police circle, Maimansingh District, Bengal; situated\nKISORIGANJ VILLAGE\u2014KISTNA.\n\non the Kund\u00e1l\u00ed kh\u00e1l, 13 miles east of the Brahmaputra. Lat. 24\u00b0 26' 20\" N., long. 90\u00b0 48' 40\" E. Population (1872) 13,637; (1881) 12,898, namely, Hindus, 5587, and Muhammadans, 7311. The town is a second-class municipality, with an income in 1883-84 of \u00a3365, of which \u00a3312 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 5\u00bdd. per head of the population (13,114) within municipal limits. Kisoriganj is connected with the Brahmaputra by a road, and also by the Kund\u00e1l\u00ed kh\u00e1l, which, however, is only navigable during the rainy months. A fair is held here annually during the Jhulan jatra, a festival in honour of the birth of Krishna, lasting for a month, from the middle of July to the middle of August.\n\nKisoriganj.\u2014Market village in Rangpur District, Bengal; situated on or near the Sankos river. Exports of rice, jute, and tobacco.\n\nKistaw\u00e1r.\u2014Town in Kashmir State, Northern India, and former capital of a small principality.

Ill-built houses; small b\u00e1z\u00e1r; fort. Manufacture of inferior shawls and coarse woollens. Elevation above sea-level, about 5000 feet.\n\nKistna (Krishna).\u2014A British District in the Madras Presidency. It lies along the coast of the Bay of Bengal at the mouth of the river Kistna or Krishna, which gives it the name it bears; between lat. 15\u00b0 35' and 17\u00b0 10' N., and between 79\u00b0 14' and 81\u00b0 34' E. Bounded on the north by God\u00e1vari District; on the east by the Bay of Bengal; on the south by Nellore; and on the west by the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions and Karn\u00fal (Kurnool). The District was formed in 1859 by the amalgamation of the two Collectorates of Gunt\u00far and Masulipatam, a small portion of the latter being assigned to God\u00e1vari District. Prior to 1859 there had been in existence the three Districts of Gunt\u00far, Masulipatam, and R\u00e1j\u00e1mandri (R\u00e1j\u00e1hmundry); but these were afterwards consolidated into the two Districts of Kistna and God\u00e1vari, each containing its own irrigation system, constructed in the deltas of the two rivers which give their names to the Districts. Area, 8471 square miles, or about the size of Wales. Population (1881) 1,548,480 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at Masulipatam.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Kistna District is, speaking generally, a flat country; but the interior is broken by a few low hills, the chief of which are Bellamkond\u00e1, Kondav\u00edr, Kondapalli, Jamalavayadurga, and Medurgh\u00e1t, the highest being 1876 feet above sea-level. The principal rivers are the Kistna (q.v.), which cuts the District into two portions known as the Masulipatam and Gunt\u00far divisions; the Munyeru, Paleru, and Naguleru (tributaries of the Kistna), and the Gundlakamma; the first only is practicable for navigation. The Kolar (Koller) Lake, which covers\nan area of 21 by 14 miles, and the Romperu swamp, are natural receptacles for the drainage on the north and south sides of the Kistna respectively. Koller Lake is navigable from June or July, according to the setting in of the heavy rains, till February. The whole coast is fringed with ridges of blown sand, the most recent formation in the District. These ridges or sandhills attain a height of from 30 to 50 feet, and the belt of sand is sometimes more than a mile in width. In some places the sand is bound by spinifex, ipomoea, and other plants, while in some nooks grow cashew-nut bushes (Anacardium occidentale). Plantations of the casuarina trees are being extended on these sands.\n\nThe geological survey of the District is completed. Iron and copper exist, and at one time the mines were worked; but the smelting of copper is now a thing of the past, and that of iron is also dying out. Diamond mines are still worked, to a very slight extent, in five bordering villages belonging to the Niz\u00e1m; and at other places in the District there are traces of mines which were abandoned long ago. Garnets and small rubies are also found. The most trustworthy account of the Kistna diamond mines is that of the French jeweller, Tavernier, who made six journeys to India to purchase precious stones. At one mine he visited, he relates that he found 60,000 people at work. From these mines were obtained the Koh-i-n\u00far and the Regent diamonds.\n\nA few tigers and leopards are found in the Kondav\u00edr and Kondapall\u00ed Hills, and in the hilly part of the Nuzv\u00edr zamindar\u00ed and the Paln\u00e1d; antelopes in the plain; and spotted deer and s\u00e1mbhar. Every variety of the game birds of India, except the pheasant, woodcock, and hill partridge, abounds in the District; and almost all the known inland aquatic birds are found on the Kol\u00e1r (Koller) Lake, when it is full. The most deadly of poisonous snakes, the Russell viper (Daboia russellii), the cobra (Naja tripudians), carpet snake (Echis carinata), and one kind of karait (Bungarus arcuatus), are also met with.\n\nForests.\u2014There is now very little forest within the limits of the District, though formerly the hills of the remote Paln\u00e1d were covered with timber. A small revenue of \u00a31368, derived from jungle conservancy, is spent in planting groves, etc. Soap-nut jungle (Sapindus emarginatus) is found in the B\u00e1patla and Gudiv\u00e1da t\u00e1luk. Repalle t\u00e1luk supplies firewood to Masulipatam. A plantation of casuarina trees in the barren sandy wastes on the coast of B\u00e1patla t\u00e1luk lost 10,000 trees in the cyclone of 1879; the trees were sold as they lay for 3d. each, and fetched 1s. each when brought by sea to Madras. The chief obstacle to the formation of forest reserve is the Opuntia vulgaris or prickly-pear cactus. As is the case with most hill forts in India, custard-apple trees are found near the old strongholds of Konda-\npall\u00ed, Kondavir, and Bellam Konda. Generally speaking, the District is bare of trees.\n\nHistory.\u2014The history of Kistna District may be divided into four periods: \u2014 the early or Hindu period; the Muhammadan period; the French period; and the period of British administration. The early history of the District is inseparable from that of the Northern Circars and Godavari District. The earliest tribes to settle in the forests that once covered the District, were the hunters, whose representatives still survive as the Chentsus and Yerikalas. For some time before and after the Christian era, Buddhism was firmly established on the banks of the Kistna. The Brahmins were invited in the third century A.D. The kingdom of Andra, with its capital Vengi, is mentioned by Hiuen Tsiang, the Chinese pilgrim, who came to India in 640 A.D. to visit its Buddhist monasteries. By that time the Pallava kings of Vengi had been conquered by the Chalukyan kings of Kalyanpur. The Chalukyan kings were succeeded by Chola kings from the south, and in the Guntur country are found traces of the rule of Chola viceroys. The Jain kings of Dharnikota were the next, if not contemporary, rulers. And it was during the Jain r\u00e9gime in 1290 that the Venetian, Marco Polo, landed at a fishing village in the B\u00e1patla taluk of this District. The Reddi kings of Kondavir shortly afterwards divided the sovereignty of the country with Orissa Raj\u00e1s from Bengal. Reddi kings reigned from 1328 to 1424. The Gajapatis of Orissa, who succeeded the Reddi dynasty, went down before the great Karn\u00e1tik kingdom of Vijayanagar. With the capture of the Kondavir fortress in 1579, the Hindu rule of Vijayanagar gave place to the Muhammadan conquerors.\n\nThe first Musalm\u00e1n king to enter Kistna District was Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, second of the B\u00e1bmani line; and a general delegated by him, with the title of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, established a Muhammadan garrison in the fort of Kondapalli. On the fall of the B\u00e1bmanis and the partition of their kingdom into the five States of Bij\u00e1pur, Bidar, Ber\u00e1r, Ahmadnagar, and Golconda, the region round Kondapalli fell to the share of Golconda. A series of attempts made by the neighbouring Raj\u00e1s to wrest the District from Musalm\u00e1n hands were all attended with failure. From this time until 1759, when the British received Masulipatam and other portions of the District, the reign of Muhammadan princes was only disturbed by the occurrences which took place in what has been called the French period.\n\nIn 1611, the English and Dutch were engaged in trade at the Kistna ports of Masulipatam and Niz\u00e1mapatam. In 1686, Masulipatam was seized by the Dutch. Three years afterwards (1689), the Dutch were expelled by the forces of Aurangzeb, and the District was included in one of the twenty-two Provinces of the Mughal Empire. From the\ndeath of Aurangzeb in 1707 until the British took possession half a century later, Kistna District formed part of the Subah of the Deccan; and it was during the Subahd\u00e1rship of the last Muhammadan viceroy, Sal\u00e1bat Jang, that the incidents of the French period occurred.\n\nThe French period is remarkable for the first active interference of a European in the internal politics of the Deccan. In 1741, Monsieur Dupleix was governor of Pondicherri, and in 1750 French troops stormed and took Masulipatam. A few months later was fought the battle in which N\u00e1sir Jang, then Subahd\u00e1r of the Deccan, was slain. Muzaffar Jang was by French aid installed at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. Sal\u00e1bat Jang succeeded Muzaffar Jang, and came also under the influence of the French. During the tenure of Sal\u00e1bat, the assistance of the French was required against the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and the exertions of French troops were rewarded by a grant of the province of Kondav\u00edr. After a short time, mainly through the instrumentality of the enterprising Monsieur de Bussi, Monsieur Dupleix administered a territory with six hundred miles of seaboard, and larger than any as yet possessed in India by a European power. Monsieur de Bussi was superseded by the Marquis de Conflans, on the arrival of Count Lally at Pondicherri. Meanwhile the English in Bengal became alarmed at the progress of the French in the Karn\u00e1tik, and a detachment under Colonel Forde and Captain Yorke was sent to Masulipatam. The place fell before their gallant and almost desperate assault. Sal\u00e1bat Jang, on the defeat of his allies, found himself compelled to sign a treaty with the English by which he resigned the greater portion of Kistna District.\n\nThe opening of the British period was disturbed by a prospect of the restoration of French influence; but with the return of Lord Clive to Bengal in 1765, British authority was confirmed, and imperial sanads were obtained from the Emperor of Delhi granting to the East India Company the five Northern Circars. The publication of the sanads took the Niz\u00e1m by surprise; and abandoning a war he had on hand with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, he turned his forces against the English. The Niz\u00e1m was joined by Haidar Al\u00ed of Mysore, but the hostilities which broke out in 1767 speedily ended with a treaty which left the Company tributary to the Niz\u00e1m for most of the territory at stake. Gunt\u00far was assigned to Bas\u00e1lat Jang, brother of the Niz\u00e1m, for life, and became during the next twelve years a focus for French and Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d intrigue against the English. But in 1788, with the rendition to the Company of the Gunt\u00far Circar, Kistna District, excepting the wild country of the Paln\u00e1d, became an integral part of the East India Company's possessions. The absolute right of sovereignty over the whole District was not obtained until 1823.\n\nPopulation.\u2014As in other Madras Districts, the population has been roughly counted every five years by the agency of the village\nestablishments. In 1861, it was estimated at 1,296,652. In 1871, when the first regular Census was taken, the population was returned at 1,452,374. According to the Census taken on the night of February 17, 1881, the population was 1,548,480, showing an increase of 96,106, or 6\u00b76 per cent., in the ten years. The density of population in 1871 was 171 persons to the square mile; in 1881, the density was 183. Kistna ranks fifteenth in respect of density of population among the Districts of the Madras Presidency. Males in 1881 numbered 780,588; females, 767,892. Classified according to age, there were in 1881\u2014under 15 years, males 310,158, and females 300,326; total children, 610,484; 15 years and upwards, males 470,430, and females 467,566; total adults, 937,996. Number of towns, 13; villages, 1810; occupied houses, 268,849; unoccupied, 18,963; towns and villages per square mile, '215; occupied houses per village, 148\u00b75; persons per occupied house, 5\u00b78. Distributed according to religion, Hindus numbered 1,425,013, or 92 per cent.; Muhammadans, 87,161, or 5\u00b76 per cent.; Christians, 36,194, or 2\u00b73 per cent.; Jains, 8; and \u2018others\u2019 104.\n\nTaking the Hindu population by caste, there were\u2014Brahmans (priests), 94,893; Kshattriyas (warrior caste), 11,569; Shettis (traders), 69,854; Vallalars (cultivators), 522,696, or over 36 per cent. of the whole; Idaiyars (shepherds), 101,578; Kammalar (artisans), 34,528; Kannakan (writers), 305; Kaikalars (weavers), 47,199; Vanniyan (labourers), 24,459; Kushavan (potters), 16,363; Sataini (mixed and depressed castes), 18,606; Shembadavan (fishermen), 5573; Shanani (toddy-drawers), 30,643; Ambattan (barbers), 16,557; Vannan (washer-men), 44,276; pariahs and \u2018others,\u2019 385,914. Divided into their tribes, the Muhammadans were thus returned\u2014Arabs, none; Mughals, 52; Pathans, 88; Sayyids, 204; Shaikhs, 1979; and \u2018other\u2019 Muhammadans, 84,838. The Christian population according to sect consisted of\u2014Protestants, 24,471; Roman Catholics, 9804; and \u2018others,\u2019 1919. The Christian population included Europeans and Americans, 52; Eurasians, 73; native converts, 15,967; and \u2018others,\u2019 20,102. About half the population were returned as workers; of the workers, 34 per cent. were women.\n\nThe Census of 1881 distributed the males into the following six groups as regards occupation:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every kind and the learned professions, 21,961;(2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 3986;(3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 19,617;(4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 340,224;(5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 100,254;(6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 294,546.\nOf the 1823 towns and villages in Kistna District, 289 in 1881 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 517 from two to five hundred; 495 from five hundred to one thousand; 403 from one to two thousand; 80 from two to three thousand; 28 from three to five thousand; 8 from five to ten thousand; 1 from ten to fifteen thousand; 1 from fifteen to twenty thousand; and 1 from twenty to fifty thousand. The urban population forms 7.9 per cent. of the whole, distributed through the following thirteen principal towns:\u2014Masulipatam (35,056); Guntur (19,646); Jaggayapet (10,072); Bezwada (9336); Chirala (9061); Bapatla (6086); Nuzvid (5657); Mangalagiri (5617); Chellapalli (5615); Kondapalli (4289); Nizampatam (4128); Vallur (4070); and Mylaveram (3704). Masulipatam and Guntur are municipalities, with a total income in 1883-84 of \u00a34766, the incidence of taxation being 10s.d. per head of the municipal population. The language spoken in the District is Telugu. The Chentsus and Yerikalas speak dialects of their own. The Yanadis and Banjaras are gipsy tribes. In 1881, the Yerikalas numbered 5914; the Banjaras, 5565; and the Yanadis, 11.\n\nThe people of Kistna District are generally poor, but an exception must be made in the case of the raya of the Delta, who are as a rule very well off. Throughout the Delta, the houses are for the most part built with brick walls, and tiled or terraced roofs; in other parts, they are of mud walls with tiled roofs. Rice is the food of all classes in the Delta, but only well-to-do people use it in the other parts of the District. The total monthly expenditure of a prosperous shopkeeper's family, consisting of five persons, would be about 28s., and that of an ordinary peasant about 16s.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of 4,093,718 acres, 667,696 were in 1882 held as inam or rent-free; of the remaining 3,426,022 acres, 1,461,964 acres were under cultivation, of which 12,615 acres were twice cropped; the whole untilled but cultivable area was returned at 964,108 acres, and the uncultivable waste at 879,126 acres. In 1882-83, of the total area (Government and inam) of 4,093,718 acres, 1,886,063 acres were under actual cultivation, of which 14,123 acres were twice cropped; cereals occupied 1,264,608 acres; pulses, 111,841; fibres, 202,874; dyes (chiefly indigo), 122,975; oil-seeds, 112,385; sugar (palm or palmyra), 6680; condiments and spices (mostly chillies), 55,105; drugs and narcotics (principally tobacco), 20,170; orchard and garden produce, 3201; and starches (chiefly potato), 357 acres. The staples raised in the District are rice, maize, ragi, pulses, hemp, flax, cotton, tobacco, gingelly, oil-seeds, chillies, wheat, garlic, indigo, and various kinds of fruit. There are three classes of crops grown\u2014namely, punasa (early crop), sown in May or June, and reaped in September; pedda (great or middle), sown from July to September, and cut between November and February; and paira\n(late crop), sown in November and December, and gathered in February and March. Rice of all kinds is sown in regar or black soil. The area under rice in 1882-83 was 351,330 acres, or 18 per cent. of the whole cultivated area. The price of the best rice per maund (80 lbs.) was, in the same year, 5s. 3d.\n\nThe Delta is irrigated by the water of the Kistna river, which has been diverted into channels by the anicut at Bezw\u00e1ra at a cost of \u00a369,741. In 1881, the area irrigated from this source, within Kistna District, was 165,136 acres; in addition, 6019 acres were fertilized by the God\u00e1vari channels, and 19,941 acres were irrigated from tanks. The total assessment on the irrigated area was \u00a3109,688. During the same year the total area irrigated from the Kistna canals amounted to 287,027 acres, the ultimate area irrigable by the works, when carried to completion, being 475,000 acres. Manure of inferior quality is generally used. The District contains numerous wells.\n\nOf a total area of 8471 square miles, 5112 square miles were assessed in 1881 for revenue, of which 3479 square miles were cultivated, 1238 square miles cultivable but not cultivated, and 395 square miles uncultivable waste. The agricultural population of the District in 1881 numbered 471,318, or 30.4 per cent. of the total population. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses on land, \u00a3478,951, or an average of 4s. 3d. per cultivated acre. Total amount of rental actually paid by cultivators, including rates and cesses, \u00a3635,460, or an average of 5s. 6d. per cultivated acre. According to the returns of 1882-83, the farm stock included 105,159 ploughs, 25,854 carts, 713 boats, 167,094 buffaloes, 358,352 bullocks and cows, 2154 horses and ponies, 304,820 goats and sheep, 33,301 pigs, 8977 donkeys, and 3 camels.\n\nThe current prices of the chief articles of food during 1882-83 were, for a rupee\u2014rice, 30 lbs.; r\u0101\u1e63i, 64 lbs.; wheat, 23 lbs.; and gram, 44 lbs. The daily wages of coolies and agricultural day labourers in 1850 were from \u00bdd. to 3d.; in 1882, from 4\u00bdd. to 6d. Skilled labourers in 1882 earned 10\u00bdd. a day; while sixteen years ago they earned 3\u00bdd. to 6d.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Famines occurred in 1423, 1474, 1686, and 1793, but of these there is no detailed account extant. The great famine of 1832-34 caused a decrease of 200,000 in the population. It was worst in the Gunt\u00far portion, and was due to the failure of both the monsoons, causing, it is said, a loss of revenue in Gunt\u00far District estimated at \u00a32,270,000. Prices rose enormously. Public works were opened, but the bulk of the people would not avail themselves of them, and wandered away to other Districts. The loss of population was only in part due to deaths. Kistna District was but slightly affected by the great South Indian famine of 1876-78.\nAlthough the cultivated area temporarily fell off by 14'2 per cent., the local scarcity did not reach famine point. Inundations of the sea overwhelmed the town of Masulipatam in the years 1779 and 1864; and in both cases they were due to a storm-wave forced on to the coast by the violence of a cyclone. The reported loss of life on each occasion was between 20,000 and 30,000 persons. In the last cyclone, the salt water penetrated to a distance of 17 miles inland.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014Next to agriculture, the most important industry in the District is weaving. The chintzes and coloured cloths of Masulipatam once enjoyed a wide reputation, and these goods were formerly sent to the Persian Gulf to the value of \u00a350,000; but the annual value of this export has now fallen to \u00a35000. In other parts of the District also the competition of cheap piece-goods from Manchester has almost destroyed the manufacture of the more durable native cloth. At Bezw\u00e1da a considerable trade is carried on in dressed hides. In the villages, the chief manufacture is still cotton-weaving, sometimes from native hand-made thread. In some of the villages saltpetre is refined. A little silk is made at Jaggayapet, and in the large towns there is some trade in copper and brass vessels. At Kondav\u00edr and Kondapalli certain manufactures are a specialty: at the former, essences and fragrant oils are distilled; at the latter, small figures and toys are cut out of the light wood (Gyrocarpus Jacquinii) found on the neighbouring hills.\n\nA curious export of the District is the feathers of the white-breasted king-fisher, which are bought up by the dealer for \u00a31, 12s. per 100. Cotton and indigo are exported in considerable quantities from Cocan\u00e1da in God\u00e1vari District, a far easier port of shipment than Masulipatam. The only business carried on by European agency is a steam cotton-press at Gunt\u00far. Cotton is brought there to be pressed, and thence sent by road and canal to Cocan\u00e1da, where the purchasers from the west reside. In 1874\u201375, the total sea-borne imports into the District were valued at \u00a3190,058, and the exports at \u00a3231,206; in 1881\u201382, the figures were\u2014imports, \u00a3114,009; exports, \u00a3274,231. The gross duty paid in the former year was \u00a31507; in the latter year, \u00a32713. In March 1882, the customs import duties, with the exception of those on liquors, arms and ammunition, and one or two other articles, were abolished throughout British India. The largest exports are of grains, seeds, and spices. The three seaports are Masulipatam, Niz\u00e1mpatam, and Ipurpalayam. Lighthouses have been built at Masulipatam and Point Devi. Seventeen thousand tons of salt were made in 1881, manufactured in the 4 factories of the District, situated at Pandraka, Manginapudi, Niz\u00e1mpatam, and Chinna Ganj\u00e1m. The value of the inland trade, with the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory, in 1881 was \u00a3182,127 passing coastwards, and \u00a3245,921 passing inland.\nThe principal roads are \u2014 from Masulipatam to Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d); from the Paln\u00e1d via Sattanapalle to Gunt\u00far, and thence to Bezw\u00e1da; from Bhadr\u00e1chalam via Tirv\u00far to Bezw\u00e1da; and from Nellore District to Pondogala on the Kistna and thence to Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. Total length of road communication, 537 miles. Length of navigable rivers, 231 miles. There is water communication between Bezw\u00e1da and the God\u00e1vari Canals. Length of navigable canals, 172 miles. Bezw\u00e1da was but a little village when the anicut was made, and the Kistna irrigation system established; it is now a flourishing town, and the busiest place in the District.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total revenue of Kistna District in 1870-71 amounted to \u00a3548,469, of which \u00a3359,172 was derived from the land. In 1882 it was \u00a3440,058, of which \u00a3386,996 was derived from the land. It appears that from the earliest times there were public officers in each village, with duties corresponding to those of a kurnam and munsif at the present day. The Musalm\u00e1ns first introduced the system of renting out villages to middlemen, or zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs, originally mere collectors of revenue, who gradually raised themselves to the position of hereditary landowners, and at last asserted their independence of the sovereign power. When negotiations were going on between the Niz\u00e1m and English, soon after the capture of Masulipatam by Colonel Forde in 1759, it was urged by the Company that, as the Niz\u00e1m had not for a considerable period received any money from the Circars, he would lose nothing by surrendering his nominal rights to the English.\n\nWhen the English undertook the government of that part of the Circars which now comprises the present District of Kistna, the lands were divided into h\u00e1veli and zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri. The h\u00e1veli lands were divided into m\u00fatahs, and were sold; the whole District, including the old zam\u00ednd\u00e1ris, and the recently sold h\u00e1veli lands, being brought under the permanent settlement of 1802. In course of time many of the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs fell into arrears, and an inquiry into the causes of this was held by Mr. (now Sir) Walter Elliott, reported on in 1846. In 1846, all the zam\u00ednd\u00e1ris in Gunt\u00far District, and some in Masulipatam District, came under the hammer, and were purchased by Government. On the Masulipatam side of the river, the custom was to let the whole village for a fixed sum to the chief inhabitants, or any one who would outbid them, leaving it to the villagers to apportion the revenue and lands among the cultivators. But when Gunt\u00far fell to Government, the strict rayatw\u00e1ri system of dealing with each rayat for his land was ordered. The revenue was fixed either by measurement or by the yearly out-turn of crops. In 1859, the new settlement, to ascertain the productive value of the land, was begun, and finished in 1873. The assessment then fixed will hold good for thirty years.\nKistna District contains 13 taluks, and several zaminuddri estates. The District is administered by a Collector and Magistrate, with 4 Assistants and 37 subordinate judicial officers. The police force consists (1882) of 1346 men, controlled by a superintendent and his assistant, who reside at Masulipatam and Guntur respectively. Cost of police (1882), \u00a317,583. There is a District jail at Guntur, and 21 subsidiary prisons. The average daily number of prisoners in Guntur jail in 1882 was 129, maintained at a cost of \u00a38 per prisoner.\n\nThe country people, save Brahmins and Komatis, are generally uneducated; but in the towns, the inhabitants gladly avail themselves of the schools that have been established. The Church Missionary Society has a station at Masulipatam, and the American Lutherans at Guntur. In 1823, the number of vernacular schools teaching Telugu was 465; Persian, 19; and Sanskrit, 49. In 1882-83, the total number of educational institutions, Government, aided, and unaided (including 3 normal schools and 44 girls' schools), was 1102, with 23,119 pupils. The Census Report of 1881 returns 19,161 boys and 1262 girls as under instruction, besides 58,365 males and 2378 females able to read and write, but not under instruction.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The District surgeon resides at Masulipatam, and there is also a civil surgeon at Guntur who has charge of the District jail. The cost of the hospitals founded in both these places is defrayed by local funds. Local funds also maintain dispensaries in every taluk, there being three in the Palnad, where malaria is prevalent. Advice and medicine are given free. Births per thousand registered in 1882, 29; deaths per thousand registered, 17. Rainfall in 1882, 47.9 inches; average of nineteen years ending 1881, 36.7 inches.

In traditional sanctity it is surpassed by both these rivers, and in actual length by the Godavari; but the area of its drainage basin, including its two great tributaries, the Bhima and Tungabhadra, is the largest of the three. Its total length is about 800 miles, and the total area of its catchment basin about 97,050 square miles.\n\nThe source of the Kistna is in 18\u00b0 1' N. lat., and 73\u00b0 41' E. long., near the Bombay sanitarium of Mahabaleshwar, in the Western Ghats, only about 40 miles from the Arabian Sea. Here stands an ancient\ntemple of Mah\u00e1deo, at the foot of a steep hill, at an elevation of about 4500 feet above sea-level. In the interior of the temple is a small tank, into which a stream of pure water ever pours out of a spout fashioned into the image of a cow's mouth. This is the traditional fountain-head of the river, which is likened to the deity in a female form, and is fondly called Krishna B\u00e1\u00ed. Pilgrims in large numbers crowd to the sacred spot, which is embowered in trees of dark foliage and flowering shrubs. From Mah\u00e1baleshwar the Kistna runs southwards in a rapid course, flowing through the British Districts of Satara and Belgaum, the cluster of Native States which form the South Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Agency, and the District of Kal\u00e1dgi. Here it turns east to pass into the dominions of the Niz\u00e1m of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. In this portion of its course it receives many tributaries, of which the chief are the Yerla, Warna, Idganga, Gh\u00e1tprabha, and M\u00e1lprabha. All these, like the main stream, are characteristic rivers of the plateau of the Deccan. They run in deep channels, from which it is almost impossible to lead off channels for irrigation. In the rainy season they swell into brimming torrents, but during the remaining eight months of the year they shrink to mere threads of water, straggling through a sandy waste.\n\nOn entering the Niz\u00e1m's dominions, the Kistna drops from the table-land of the Deccan Proper down to the alluvial Do\u00e1bs of Shor\u00e1pur and R\u00e1ichur. The fall is as much as 408 feet in about three miles. In time of flood, a mighty volume of water rushes with a great roar over a succession of broken ledges of granite, dashing up a lofty column of spray. The first of the Doabs mentioned above is formed by the confluence of the Bh\u00edma, which brings down the drainage of Ahmadnagar, Poona, and Shol\u00e1pur; the second by the confluence of the Tungabhadra, which drains the north of Mysore and the 'Ceded Districts' of Bellary and Karn\u00fal (Kurnool). At the point of junction with the Tungabhadra, the Kistna again strikes upon British territory, and, still flowing east, forms for a considerable distance the boundary between the Madras Presidency and the Niz\u00e1m's dominions. Here it is joined by its last important tributary, the Musi, on whose banks stands the Niz\u00e1m's capital of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. On reaching the frontier chain of the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts, the Kistna turns south to reach the sea.\n\nThe delta, for about 100 miles from the mountains to the Bay of Bengal, lies entirely within British territory, and is now known as the District of Kistna. The river ultimately falls into the sea by two principal mouths. Along this part of the coast runs an extensive strip of land, which has been entirely formed by the detritus washed down by the Kistna and the God\u00e1vari. As a great part of the course of the Kistna and its tributaries flow through alluvial soil, the flood-water is heavily charged with silt. The rocky bed through which the river flows in Karn\u00fal District, and in the Paln\u00e1d and Sattanapalli Sub-divisions of Kistna\nDistrict, does not favour the deposit of much of this silt. The channel which the river has found among the older rocks must be scoured out in high floods, for the average fall of the river in the 295 miles above Bazw\u00e1da is 3\u00b75 feet per mile. When it reaches Bazw\u00e1da, it is confined between two gneissic hills, the width of the gorge being about 1300 yards. At this point the velocity of the river in flood is rather more than 6\u00b75 miles an hour, and the maximum flood discharge attains the enormous figure of 761,000 cubic feet per second. The solid matter carried by the flood-water past Bezw\u00e1da is $\\frac{4}{3}$ of the bulk. It follows that the Kistna in high flood carries past Bezw\u00e1da daily enough detritus to form a deposit one foot deep over a surface of five square miles. Below Bezw\u00e1da to the sea, the fall of the river is only 0\u00b766 foot per mile, and the bed widens out to three or four miles, so that in the course of ages an extensive deltaic tract has formed between Bezw\u00e1da and the coast. This delta slopes away on either side, with a fall of about 18 inches per mile from the elevated river bed; hence all that is not protected by embankments is submerged whenever a high flood occurs, and the deposition of fluviatile alluvium still continues. The Kol\u00e1r (Koller) Lake, a depression between the deltas of the God\u00e1vari and the Kistna rivers, represents the work still to be done by this alluvium in levelling up the land wrested from the sea by the rivers. The actual mouths of the rivers have thrown out low promontories far into the sea.\n\nThe Kistna may be said to be almost entirely useless for navigation. From Jaggayapet down to the anicut (about 50 miles), the river is navigable for about six months of the year by sea-going dhonis, which are brought up either by the Bandar or the Ellore Canal. The chief port in the delta is Masulipatam, a bare roadstead, liable to be swept by cyclones. The river channel is throughout too rocky and the stream too rapid to allow even of small native craft. The mode of crossing at the ferries is by wide circular baskets, made of hides stretched over a framework of bamboos. Near R\u00e1ichur, the main stream is crossed by a magnificent iron girder bridge of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway.\n\nIn utility for irrigation the Kistna is also inferior to its two sister streams, the God\u00e1vari and the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery). Throughout the upper portion of its course it runs in a deep bed, with high banks rising from 30 to 50 feet above its ordinary level. Naturally it drains rather than waters the surrounding country; and but insufficient attempts have yet been made to extend its usefulness by means of artificial channels. Of its tributaries, the head-waters of the Bhima are dammed up at Kharakwasla to furnish Poon\u00e1 with a water-supply; and the Madras Irrigation Company have expended large sums of money to water the thirsty soil of Karn\u00fal (Kurnool) from the floods of the Tungabhadra. On the main stream, a small work has been constructed high up in Sat\u00e1ra\nDistrict, called the Kistna Canal. A dam has been thrown across the bed of the river, from which a canal is taken parallel to the left bank, capable of irrigating an area of 1825 acres.\n\nBut by far the greatest irrigation work on the Kistna is the Bezw\u00e1da anicut, first commenced in 1852, when the similar undertakings on the deltas of the K\u00e1veri and God\u00e1vari had pointed out the way to success. Bezw\u00e1da is a small town at the entrance of the gorge by which the Kistna bursts down through the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts upon the plains. The channel is here 1300 yards wide. During the dry season the depth of water is barely 6 feet, which rises in summer freshes sometimes to as much as 40 feet. The maximum flood discharge is calculated at 761,000 cubic feet of water per second. The object of the engineer has been to regulate this excessive supply, so that it shall no longer run to waste and destruction, but be husbanded for the purposes of agriculture, and to some extent also of navigation. The Bezw\u00e1da anicut consists of a mass of loose stone, faced with a front of masonry. Its total length is 1238\u00bd yards, the breadth 263 feet, and the height above the river bed 20 feet. At each end sluices have been provided, in order to scour out channels for the heads of the two main canals. Of these, the one on the left bank breaks into two branches, one running 39 miles to Ellore, the other 49 miles to Masulipatam. The canal on the right bank proceeds nearly parallel to the river, and also sends off two principal branches, to Niz\u00e1mpatam and Komamur. The total length of the main channels (not including minor distributaries) is 254 miles; the total irrigated area is 226,000 acres, yielding a revenue of \u00a389,000. Schemes are now under consideration for extending the network of canals. The Kistna canal system is connected with that of the God\u00e1vari through the town of Ellore.\n\n**Kistnapur.** \u2014 Town in Kar\u00fanagapalli District, Travancore State, Madras Presidency. Lat. 9\u00b0 9' N., long. 76\u00b0 33' E. Population (1871) 3731; houses, 895. Not returned in the Census Report of 1881. Seat of a District judge; contains a palace and a large square fort in good repair to the west; a canal leads to K\u00e1yenkolam. Its once active seaborne trade has now disappeared.\n\n**Kitt\u00far.** \u2014 Town and fort in the S\u00e1mpg\u00e1on Sub-division of Belg\u00e1um District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 15\u00b0 35' 30\" N., and long. 74\u00b0 50' E.; 26 miles south-east of Belg\u00e1um. Population (1872) 7166; (1881) 6300. The Des\u00e1is of Kitt\u00far were descended from two brothers, who came as bankers with the Bij\u00e1pur army towards the close of the 16th century. By distinguished action in the field, the Des\u00e1is obtained a grant of Hubli; and their fifth successor established himself at Kitt\u00far. On the fall of the Peshw\u00e1, the town passed into the hands of the British Government. But in 1818, when General Munro was besieging the fort of Belg\u00e1um, the Des\u00e1i of Kitt\u00far gave great assistance, and in\nreturn was allowed to retain possession of his town of Kitt\u00far. The Des\u00e1i died in 1824, without issue. An attempt was subsequently made to prepare a forged deed of adoption, which led to an outbreak, in which the Political Agent and Collector, Mr. Thackeray, was killed, and his two Assistants imprisoned. The prisoners were afterwards released, but the fort was not surrendered until it had been attacked and breached, with a loss of 3 killed and 25 wounded. Among the killed was Mr. Munro, Sub-Collector of Shol\u00e1pur, and a nephew of Sir Thomas Munro. Kitt\u00far then finally passed into the hands of the British, although another rising occurred in 1829, which was not suppressed without difficulty. Bi-weekly markets are held in Kitt\u00far town on Mondays and Thursdays, at which cotton, cloth, and grain are sold. Weaving and glass bangle-making are the sole industries. School and post-office.\n\n**Koch** (also called *Pali* or *R\u00e1jbansi*). \u2014 These three names are applied to a race of aboriginal descent found in the Districts of North-Eastern Bengal, and in Assam. Nothing is known for certainty as to their origin, but their name and that of the ancient kingdom over which they once ruled is still preserved in the independent State of Kuch (or Koch) Behar. The best authorities regard the Kochs as a branch of the Bodo, Mech, or Cachari stock who had become Hinduized at a very early date, and who dominated the ancient kingdom of K\u00e1mr\u00e1n in Lower Bengal, stretching eastwards as far as the borders of Bh\u00fat\u00e1n. The Kochs, except by their broad faces, flat noses, and projecting cheek-bones, are now hardly to be distinguished from ordinary Hindus. On the conversion of the K\u00e1mr\u00e1n kings to Hinduism, a divine ancestry was found for the race, and numbers of Kochs now repudiate their race name, and claim that of R\u00e1jbansi, literally \u2018of royal descent.\u2019 With the exception of the people known as P\u00e1n\u00ed Koch who inhabit the submontane tract at the foot of the G\u00e1ro hills, and who have only partially accepted Hinduism by abstaining from the use of beef as food, the whole of the Koch people have adopted exclusive Hindu caste habits. The total number of Kochs (including R\u00e1jbans\u00eds) returned in the Census Report of 1881 is 1,985,180, confined wholly to the Districts of North-Eastern Bengal and Assam.\n\n**Kochchi Bandar.**\u2014Town in Mal\u00e1b\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency. \u2014See COCHIN.\n\n**Kod.**\u2014Sub-division of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 400 square miles; number of villages, 177; population (1881) 80,345, namely, 41,397 males and 38,948 females. Hindus numbered 72,759; Muhammadans, 7138; and \u2018others,\u2019 448. Since 1872, the population has increased by 1246.\n\nKod, the most southern Sub-division of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, is dotted with small hills and ponds; some of the latter when full are two or\nthree miles in length. Many of the hillocks are bare, but the range which separates Kod from Mysore is covered with brushwood and low forests. A considerable portion of the Sub-division is well watered, and covered with sugar-cane fields and areca palms. The villages are small, close together, well shaded, and situated in the open plains. The soil is chiefly red; black soil occurring in a few villages in the east. The north and west are studded with small hills and knolls, and the south is also hilly. The Tungabhadra touches a few villages in the south-east corner; the Kumadvati, rising in the Madak lake in Mysore, with a bed 150 feet broad, and between steep banks, flows east across the Sub-division. In the hot season it holds water in pools. Though cool and healthy during the hot months, the climate is very feverish during the cold season. During the ten years ending 1881, the rainfall at Hireker\u00far, the head-quarters of the Sub-division, averaged 25.73 inches.\n\nOf the 400 square miles, 389 have been surveyed in detail. Fifteen square miles are occupied by alienated villages. The remainder consists of 191,648 acres of arable land, of which 46,810 acres are alienated lands in Government villages; 2016 acres, unarable land; 3774 acres, grass land; 25,829 acres, forests; and 23,811 acres, village sites, roads, rivers, and streams. In 1881\u201382, of 123,768 acres, the whole Government area occupied for tillage, 25,859 acres were fallow or under grass. Of the 97,909 acres under tillage, cereals covered 65,539 acres; pulses, 7018 acres; oil-seeds, 3843 acres; fibres, 3370 acres; and miscellaneous crops, 18,139 acres, of which chillies occupied 16,219 acres. In 1882\u201383, the Sub-division contained 35 boys\u2019 and 1 girls\u2019 school, 2 criminal courts, and 1 police station (th\u00e1n\u00e1); regular police, 43 men; village watchmen, 185.

Lat. 10\u00b0 13' 21\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 31' 38\" E. A hill sanitarium, 7209 feet above sea-level. Population of Vilpatti (1871) 757; (1881) 1080, namely, 605 males and 475 females, occupying 219 houses. Hindus numbered 794; Christians, 258; and Muhammadans, 28. Kodaik\u00e1nal is a summer resort of growing popularity. It contains two churches\nand several English houses, and is about 40 miles by road from Ammayanayakanur station on the Tuticorin branch of the South Indian Railway. The climate is similar to that of Utakamand (Ootacamund), but somewhat milder, with a lighter rainfall, and without its raw and treacherous moisture. But the site of the settlement is ill chosen, and many more suitable spots exist on the Palni range.\n\n**Kod\u00e1shiri.**\u2014Mountain in Cochin State, Madras Presidency.

Noted for its blankets.\n\n**Kodungal\u00far** (Cranganore; Kodungal\u00far Singulyi\u2014Yule; Kzuangaloor\u2014Tohfat-al-Mahajidin; Cudnegalur and Crangalor\u2014Bartolomeo).\u2014Town in Cochin State, Madras Presidency. Lat. 10\u00b0 13' 50\" N., long. 76\u00b0 14' 50\" E. Population (1876) 9475; number of houses, 1990. Situated on the so-called island of Chetw\u00e1i, at one of the three openings of the great Cochin backwater, 18 miles north-north-west from Cochin town. Now a place of little importance, but of great and varied historical interest. Tradition assigns to it the double honour of having been the first field of Saint Thomas\u2019 labours (A.D. 52?) in India, and the seat of Cherum\u00e1n Perum\u00e1l\u2019s government (A.D. 341). The visit of Saint Thomas must be regarded as mythical. But it is certain that the Syrian Church was firmly established here before the 9th century (Burnell), and probably the Jews\u2019 settlement was still earlier. The latter, in fact, claim to hold grants dated 378 A.D.\n\nThe cruelty of the Portuguese, and their Goa Inquisition, drove most of the Jews to Cochin. Up to 1314, when the Vyp\u00edn harbour was formed, the only opening in the back-water, and outlet for the Periy\u00e1r, was at Kodungal\u00far, which must at that time have been the best harbour on the coast. Dr. Day says: \u2018The Cranganore\n(Kodungal\u00far) Division has been the scene of most momentous changes in times gone by. Here the Jew and the Christian obtained a footing, and founded towns before the Portuguese landed in India. Here the Perum\u00e1ls flourished and decayed. On this spot the Portuguese fort was raised in 1523, which they contemplated making the seat of their chief power in Malab\u00e1r. Here fell the Portuguese before Dutch prowess, whilst Cochin still continued in their possession. Here the Dutch had to sell their fort and territory to a native prince, before the British would fire a shot to hold back the victorious Tip\u00fa. Now the fort is a ruin, mouldering in the dust, with but one solitary tower overhanging the broad expanse of the river, which rolls on slowly but deeply beneath. Its old moat is the resort of the crocodile and paddy-bird; and its once well-used streets resound no more to human tread. The solitary stranger, perhaps, disturbs a snake in this path or an owl in the dense overhanging trees, but rarely a mortal will meet his eye. Cranganore fort is utterly and entirely deserted.\n\nIn 1502, the Syrian Christians invoked the protection of the Portuguese. In 1523, the latter built their first fort here; and in 1565 enlarged it. In 1661, the Dutch took the fort, the possession of which for the next forty years was contested between the Dutch, the Zamorin, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kodungal\u00far. In 1776, Tip\u00fa seized the stronghold. The Dutch recaptured it two years later; and having ceded it to Tip\u00fa in 1784, sold it to the Travancore R\u00e1j\u00e1, and again to Tip\u00fa in 1789, who destroyed and left it in the following year.\n\nThe present town consists of two villages, Metthala and Lakamaleshwara. In the latter are the ruins of some curious old pagodas. The remains of the ancient watch-tower, and the palace of the titular R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kodungal\u00far, are of interest. A few miles inland is Ambalkota, where the Jesuits had one of their earliest seminaries, and published in 1577 the first printed work in Malay\u00e1lam. The town is considered of great sanctity both by Christians and Hindus.\n\n**Koel.\u2014Tahs\u00edl in Al\u00edgarh District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Koil.**\n\n**Koel, North.\u2014River of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Bengal; rises in lat. 23\u00b0 4' N., and long. 84\u00b0 30' E., in the Barw\u00e1 Hills, in the west of Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District; and, after passing through the centre of Pal\u00e1mau Sub-division, falls into the Son (Soane) on the northern boundary of the District, in lat. 24\u00b0 32' N., and long. 83\u00b0 56' E., about 20 miles above Dehri. Tributaries\u2014the Am\u00e1nat and Aurang\u00e1 on the right, and some insignificant streams on the left bank. The Koel has a rocky bed in its earlier course, which becomes sandy as it nears the Son. Navigation is obstructed by a ridge of gneiss rock crossing the river near Sigsigi; and even if this obstacle could be removed, the sudden freshets which occur during the rains would render navigation extremely dangerous.**\nKoel, South.\u2014River of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1jpur, Bengal; rises in lat. $23^\\circ 18' 30''$ N., and long. $85^\\circ 6' 15''$ E., in Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District, a short distance west of R\u00e1nchi town. It flows circuitously southwards, until after a course of 185 miles it is joined by the Sankh river in the Tributary State of G\u00e1ngpur, whence the united stream becomes the Brahmani, and ultimately flows into the Bay of Bengal in the north-west of Cuttack District by the Dh\u00e1mr\u00e1 estuary. The principal feeders of the Koel are the North and South Karo, the Deo, and other minor streams.\n\nKoh\u00e1t.\u2014A British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab (Panj\u00e1b), lying between $32^\\circ 47'$ and $33^\\circ 53'$ N. lat., and between $70^\\circ 34'$ and $72^\\circ 17'$ E. long. Koh\u00e1t forms the south-western District of the Pesh\u00e1war Division, and is one of the north-western Districts of the Punjab. It is bounded on the north by Pesh\u00e1war District and the Afr\u00eddi Hills, and on the north-west by the Orakzai country; on the south by Bannu; on the east by the river Indus; and on the west by the Z\u00e1imukht hills, the river Kuram, and the Waz\u00edr\u00ed hills. Area, 2838 square miles; population (1881) 181,540 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Koh\u00e1t.\n\nPhysical Aspect.\u2014The District of Koh\u00e1t consists chiefly of a bare and intricate mountain region, deeply scored with river valleys and ravines, but enclosing many rich valleys, and rendered economically valuable by the rich deposits of rock-salt which occur amongst its sterile hills. The eastern or Khatak country, especially, comprises a perfect labyrinth of interlacing mountain ranges, which fall, however, into two principal groups, to the north and south of the Teri Toi river, although the line between them is not clearly marked by the river. The hills in the north of the District are of limestone, and those to the south of sandstone formation. The line of demarcation between the two, however, generally runs a good deal north of the Teri Toi. The lower Miranzai valley, in the extreme west, appears by comparison a rich and fertile tract. In its small but carefully tilled and abundantly irrigated glens, fig, plum, apricot, and many other orchard trees flourish luxuriantly; while a brushwood of wild olive, mimosa, and other thorny bushes, clothes the rugged ravines upon the upper slopes, where, however, there are very few gardens. Occasional grassy glades upon their sides form favourite pasture grounds for the Waz\u00edr\u00ed tribes.\n\nThe Teri Toi river, rising on the eastern limit of Upper Miranzai, and running due eastward to the Indus, which it joins 12 miles north of Makhad, divides the District into two main portions. The drainage from the northern half flows southwards, in a complicated system, into the Teri Toi itself, and northward into the parallel stream of the Koh\u00e1t Toi. That of the southern tract falls northwards also\ninto the Teri Toi, and southwards towards the Kuram and the Indus. The frontier mountains, continuations of the Safed Koh system, attain in places a considerable elevation, the two principal peaks, Dupa Sir and Mazeo Garh, just beyond the British frontier, being 8260 and 7940 feet above the sea respectively. The Waziri hills, on the south, extend like a wedge between the boundaries of Bannu and Koh\u00e1t, with a general elevation of less than 4000 feet. The salt mines are situated in the low line of hills crossing the valley of the Teri Toi, and extending along both banks of that river. The mineral occurs as a solid rock of bluish-grey colour, exposed at intervals for a distance of 40 miles, so as to be quarried rather than mined. The deposit has a width of a quarter of a mile, with a thickness of 1000 feet; it sometimes forms hills 200 feet in height, almost entirely composed of solid rock-salt, and may probably rank as one of the largest veins of its kind in the world. The most extensive exposure occurs at Bah\u00e1dur Khel, in the south of the District, on a stream draining into the Kuram river. Petroleum springs exude from a rock at Panoba, 23 miles east of Koh\u00e1t; and sulphur exists in the northern range, but the supply of both is trifling.\n\nHistory.\u2014The annals of the District coincide with those of its two principal tribes, the Khatak and Bangash Path\u00e1ns, who constitute together more than 60 per cent. of the population. The latter occupy the Miranzai valley, with the western portion of Koh\u00e1t proper; while the Khataks hold the remainder of the eastern territory up to the bank of the Indus. According to tradition, the Bangash Path\u00e1ns were driven from Gardez in the Ghilzai country by its present possessors, and settled in the Kuram valley about the 14th century A.D. Thence they spread eastward, over the Miranzai and Koh\u00e1t region, fighting for the ground inch by inch with the Orakzais, whom they cooped up at last in the frontier hills. This migration probably took place before the time of B\u00e1bar, as that Emperor in his Memoirs mentions the Bangash tribe among the races inhabiting the fourteen Provinces of K\u00e1b\u00fal.\n\nThroughout the Mughal period, their allegiance to the imperial court seems to have been little more than nominal; but the Dur\u00e1ni Emperors extended their sway to these remote valleys, and Taimur Sh\u00e1h collected a regular revenue from the Miranzai glens. Early in the present century, Koh\u00e1t and Hangu formed a governorship under Sard\u00e1r Samad Kh\u00e1n, one of the B\u00e1rakzai brotherhood, whose leader, Dost Muhammad, usurped the throne of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n. The sons of Sard\u00e1r Samad Kh\u00e1n were driven out about 1828 by the Peshawar Sard\u00e1rs, the principal of whom was Sard\u00e1r Sult\u00e1n Muhammad. Meanwhile, the great Sikh reaction had been spreading on every side from its centre at Amritsar, and began to affect even the distant Pathan\nhill country. In 1834, Ranj\u00edt Singh occupied Pesh\u00e1war, and Sult\u00e1n Muhammad Kh\u00e1n retired to K\u00e1b\u00fal. But the Sikhs found themselves unable to levy revenue from the hardy mountaineers; and in the following year Ranj\u00edt Singh restored Sult\u00e1n Muhammad Kh\u00e1n to a position of importance at Pesh\u00e1war, and made him a grant of Koh\u00e1t and Hangu. Sard\u00e1r Sult\u00e1n Muhammad Kh\u00e1n continued to govern Koh\u00e1t District through his sons till the breaking out of the second Sikh war. The country, however, was generally in a disturbed state, and the Upper Miranzai villages were practically independent. When the Sikh troops took up arms at Pesh\u00e1war on the outbreak of the second Sikh war, George Lawrence, the British officer there, took refuge at Koh\u00e1t, but Sult\u00e1n Muhammad played false, and delivered him over as a prisoner to the Sikhs.\n\nAt the close of the campaign, Sult\u00e1n Muhammad Kh\u00e1n and his adherents retired to K\u00e1b\u00fal, and the District with the rest of the Punjab was annexed to the British dominions. The boundaries to the west were, however, left undefined. The people petitioned that they had always belonged to Koh\u00e1t, and in August 1851, Upper Miranzai was formally annexed by proclamation, and an expedition was immediately despatched up the valley to establish our rule. There was no fighting beyond a little skirmishing with the Waz\u00edris near Biland Khel. The lawless Miranzai tribes, however, had no desire to be under either British or Afgh\u00e1n rule. They were most insubordinate, paid no revenue, and obeyed no orders. Seeing this, the Punjab Government wished to withdraw from Miranzai; but the supreme authority supervened. The people still refused to pay revenue, and incursions across the frontier continued to disturb the peace of the new District. At last, in 1855, a force of 4000 men marched into the valley, enforced the revenue settlement, and punished a recusant village at the foot of the Z\u00e1imukht Hills. The Miranzais quickly reconciled themselves to British rule; and during the Mutiny of 1857, no opposition of any sort took place in the valley. In March 1858, it was finally decided that the Kuram river was to form the western boundary of the District, thus excluding Biland Khel on the opposite bank, which, although really a part of Miranzai, was handed over to the K\u00e1b\u00fal Government.\n\nThe Khataks, who occupy the eastern half of the District, are an important tribe, holding the west bank of the Indus for a distance of 120 miles from Hund, north of the K\u00e1b\u00fal river in Pesh\u00e1war, to K\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1gh in Bannu. According to tradition, they left their native home in the Sul\u00e1\u00edm\u00e1n mountains about the 13th century, and settled in Bannu District. Thence they migrated northward two hundred years later, through a quarrel with the ancestors of the Bannuchis, and occupied their present domains. One of their leaders, M\u00e1lik Akor, agreed with the Emperor Akbar to protect the country south of the K\u00e1b\u00fal river\nfrom depredations, and received in return a grant of territory with the right of levying tolls at the Akora ferry. He was thus enabled to assume the chieftainship of his tribe, and to hand down his authority to his descendants, among whom was the warrior poet, Khush\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n.\n\nThe Khatak chiefs ruled at Akora; but after the establishment of the power of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1n\u00ed, it became the custom for a junior member of the family to rule as sub-chief at Teri. This office gradually became hereditary, and the sub-chiefs ruled the Western Khataks in complete independence of the Akora chiefs. The history of these affairs is very confused. The Akora chiefs were constantly interfering in Teri affairs. There were generally two or more rival claimants; the chiefship was constantly changing hands, and assassination and rebellion were matters of every-day occurrence. On the occupation of Pesh\u00e1war by the Sikhs under Ranj\u00edt Singh, the rival claimants were Ras\u00fal Kh\u00e1n and Biland Kh\u00e1n. At last, in 1835, Ranj\u00edt Singh granted Koh\u00e1t and Hangu to Sult\u00e1n Muhammad Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1r\u00e1kzai, to whom Ras\u00fal Kh\u00e1n submitted, and obtained the government in return for a fixed tribute. Ras\u00fal Kh\u00e1n held peaceable possession till his death in 1843; when he was succeeded by his adopted son, Khw\u00e1ja Muhammad Kh\u00e1n. The latter was subsequently expelled for a short time by Muhammad Kh\u00e1n; but on the retirement of the Afgh\u00e1ns from Pesh\u00e1war, at the close of the campaign of 1848, he again assumed the government of the Teri country, in which the British authorities confirmed him, after the annexation. Khw\u00e1ja Muhammad has proved himself a loyal subject; and in 1872 he obtained the title of Naw\u00e1b, with the Knight Commandership of the Star of India.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The Census of 1855 returned the number of inhabitants of Koh\u00e1t District at 101,232. That of 1868 showed an increase of 44,187 persons, or 43\u00b764 per cent. The latter enumeration extended over an area of 2838 square miles, and it disclosed a total population of 145,419 persons, distributed among 343 villages or townships, and inhabiting 28,639 houses. In 1881, over the same area, the Census returned a population of 181,540, showing a further increase of 36,121, or 24\u00b78 per cent., since 1868. Total number of towns and villages in 1881, 367; number of houses, 22,442; families, 32,365. Total population, 181,540, namely, males 101,369, and females 80,171. From these data the following averages may be deduced:\u2014Persons per square mile, 64; villages per square mile, 0\u00b713; houses per square mile, 9; persons per village, 494; persons per house, 8\u00b710; proportion of males, 55\u00b762 per cent. Classified according to age, there were, under 15 years\u201440,181 boys, and 34,747 girls; total children, 74,928, or 41\u00b73 per cent.; above 15 years of age\u2014males, 61,188; females, 45,424; total adults, 106,612, or 58\u00b77 per cent.\n\nAs regards religious distinctions, the District retains the Musal-\nm\u00e1n faith of its early Path\u00e1n settlers. The Muhammadans number 169,219 persons, or 93.21 per cent., as against 9828 Hindus, or 5.41 per cent.; 2240 Sikhs, or 1.23 per cent.; Jains, 41; and Christians, 212. The Hindus chiefly belong to the trading castes. They comprise 882 Br\u00e1hmans, 1383 Khetris, and 5233 Aroras, with a small sprinkling of R\u00e1jputs, J\u00e1ts, and Ahirs. Among the Muhammadans, 7776 rank as Sayyids; but the Path\u00e1ns form by far the largest division, numbering 116,431, or over two-thirds of the whole population, consisting mainly of the Khatak and Bangash tribes. The Khatak Path\u00e1ns are tall and good-looking mountaineers, fairer than their Pesh\u00e1war brethren; and though naturally wild and lawless, have settled down under our firm administration into peaceful subjects. The Bangash possess an equally fine physique, but lie under the imputation of cowardice.\n\nThe District contains only one town with a population exceeding 5000\u2014viz. Koh\u00e1t, the head-quarters station, with a total in 1881 of 18,179 inhabitants, including suburbs and military cantonment; Hangu, the capital of the Upper Bangash, and Teri, head-quarters of the Khatak Naw\u00e1bs, also possess a certain political importance. Of the 367 villages in the District in 1881, 148 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 127 from two to five hundred; 53 from five hundred to a thousand; 27 from one thousand to two thousand; 6 from two to three thousand; 5 from three to five thousand; and 1 upwards of five thousand inhabitants.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census of 1881 classified the male adults under the seven following headings:\u2014(1) Professional, 9035; (2) domestic, 1669; (3) commercial, 1700; (4) agricultural and pastoral, 30,681; (5) industrial and manufacturing, 9246; (6) indefinite and non-productive, 4701; (7) unspecified, 4156.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Koh\u00e1t District, though limited in its capabilities by its generally hilly surface, has made rapid progress in cultivation since the introduction of British rule. At the date of annexation, only 64,772 acres were under cultivation, out of a total area of 1,816,600 acres; but the figures rose steadily, being returned at 76,792 acres in 1860\u201361; 160,900 acres in 1868\u201369; 163,015 acres in 1873\u201374; and 201,947 acres in 1876\u201377, when measurements were first taken by the Settlement Department. These figures, however, are approximate only, and probably considerably in excess of the truth, as in 1881\u201382, when a circuit of the District was made by the patw\u00e1ris or village accountants, the cultivated area was ascertained to be only 145,845 acres. In the period of anarchy under the B\u00e1rakzai Sard\u00e1rs, tillage had almost disappeared; the cattle had been carried off, and the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs had fled to the hills. But since annexation, the area under the plough has increased by 125 per cent.\nThe agricultural staples include wheat and barley for the spring harvest, with rice, millet, Indian corn, and pulses for the autumn crops. Tobacco, mustard, and oil-seeds also cover small areas, and cotton of inferior quality is grown in favourable years. The area under each crop in 1881-82 was returned as follows:\u2014 Wheat, 48,950 acres; barley, 18,765 acres; Indian corn, 18,991 acres; rice, 4201 acres; bajra, 35,581 acres; jo\u00e1r, 287 acres; kangwi, 1883 acres; gram, 5860 acres; moth, 2715 acres; mug and mash, 5006 acres; cotton, 2822 acres; etc. Cultivation has now nearly reached its utmost limit in the glens and hollows of these barren hills. Irrigation from the hill streams supplied water to 40,607 acres in 1882-83. Manure is abundantly used in lands near the villages, and more sparingly elsewhere. Rotation of crops exist only in its simplest form.\n\nPrices ruled as follows on the 1st of January 1873:\u2014 Wheat, 18 sers per rupee, or 6s. 3d. per cwt.; barley, 34 sers per rupee, or 3s. 4d. per cwt.; Indian corn, 25 sers per rupee, or 4s. 6d. per cwt.; bajra, 26 sers per rupee, or 4s. 4d. per cwt. During the recent Afgh\u00e1n campaigns, the prices of all descriptions of food-grains of all sorts rose extremely high. Prices have since fallen, but up to the end of 1882 had not sunk to their normal rates before the war. On the 1st January 1882, wheat was 14 sers per rupee, or 8s. per cwt.; barley, 29\u00bd sers per rupee, or 3s. 9\u00bdd. per cwt.; Indian corn, 21\u00bd sers per rupee, or 5s. 2\u00bdd. per cwt.; and bajra, 19 sers per rupee, or 5s. 1\u00bdd. per cwt. In October 1882, rates were\u2014for wheat, 18\u00bd sers per rupee, or 6s. 1d. per cwt.; barley, 30\u00bd sers per rupee, or 3s. 8d. per cwt.; Indian corn, 24 sers per rupee, or 4s. 8d. per cwt.; and bajra, 25\u00bd sers per rupee, 4s. 5d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The principal industry of the District is that of its salt mines, situated in the range of hills along the Teri Toi. Five mines are now open\u2014Malgin and Jatta on the northern bank, and Narri, Bahadur Khel, and Kharrak on the opposite side of the river (each of which see separately). Traders resort to the mines from Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n and the Punjab towns. The Preventive Establishment, maintained by Government for the protection of the salt revenue, comprised in 1881 a body of 208 officers and men. The total quantity of salt quarried at all five mines during the year 1870-71, amounted to 407,098 maunds, or 294,680 cwt., yielding a duty of \u00a38556. In 1881, the total quantity of salt quarried was 525,494 standard maunds, or 375,352 cwt., yielding a duty of \u00a39073. The average duty realized during the nine years ending 1881-82 was \u00a39093 a year. The trade flourishes chiefly during the winter months, as the camels cannot work in the hottest part of the summer. The head-quarters of the salt establishment are at Jatt\u00e1. Gun and rifle barrels manufactured near\nKoh\u00e1t town have a considerable reputation along the north-western frontier. Coloured scarves, woollen carpets, country cloth, and pottery are also made at Koh\u00e1t, Hangu, and Teri.\n\nThe frontier military road forms the chief channel of communication for wheeled conveyances and artillery. There is a good metalled road to Kushalgarh (29 miles), a point on the Indus on the road to R\u00e1wal Pindi, where there is a good boat bridge, and the terminus of a branch of the Punjab Northern State Railway. The road to Bannu is metalled in patches, but is barely practicable for wheeled traffic. A road via Hangu to Thal was commenced during the Afgh\u00e1n war, and although much money was spent, it was abandoned while still unfinished. One or two roads led into Pesh\u00e1war District via Mir Kalan and Khair\u00e1b\u00e1d, but they are not practicable for wheeled traffic. The road to Pesh\u00e1war leads for 12 miles through Afridi territory, through a defile known as the Koh\u00e1t Pass, a rough tract frequently covered with large boulders. The above are the only roads in the District; the cross tracks between the different villages are often difficult even for horsemen. They cross rough rocky hills and precipitous ravines, and in the cultivated tracts are much broken up by irrigation cuts. The Frontier Telegraph Line from Pesh\u00e1war crosses the District, with a station at Koh\u00e1t town.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total imperial revenue raised in the District during the year 1851-52 amounted to \u00a39824. By 1882-83, the revenue had increased to \u00a314,477, of which \u00a38909 were derived from the land. The other principal items of revenue are salt and stamps. A small Provincial and local revenue is also raised for home expenditure. The administrative staff consists of a Deputy Commissioner, with one or more Assistant and extra-Assistant Commissioners. Naw\u00e1b Khw\u00e1ja Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, K.C.S.I., of Teri, exercises the powers of an honorary magistrate within the Teri Sub-division. In 1882, the District contained 10 civil and revenue judges, and as many magistrates.\n\nThe imperial police force in 1882 numbered 439 officers and men, besides a municipal constabulary of 54 men at Koh\u00e1t; the rural watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs) numbered 115 men; making a total force of 608, or one to every 4\u00b766 square miles of area and every 299 of the population.\n\nThe District jail at Koh\u00e1t had a daily average of 164 prisoners in 1882. The troops quartered in the District usually comprise 1 mountain battery and 1 garrison battery of artillery, 1 regiment of cavalry, and 3 regiments of infantry, making a total of about 3000 men of all arms. The head-quarters are at Koh\u00e1t town, but numerous outposts are maintained along the frontier line. Education remains in a very backward stage. Four Government or aided schools, and 43 indigenous schools, had a total roll of only 745 pupils in 1872-73. In 1882, the Government-inspected schools numbered only 6, with 632\npupils, while the indigenous village schools were returned at 251, with 2447 pupils. The only municipality in the District is that of Koh\u00e1t town (q.v.).\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The proximity of the hills renders Koh\u00e1t comparatively cool, except during the summer months; but no record of temperature is available. The rainfall for the sixteen years ending 1881-82 is returned as follows:\u20141866-67, 15\u00b71 inches; 1867-68, 14\u00b71 inches; 1868-69, 13\u00b74 inches; 1869-70, 19\u00b71 inches; 1870-71, 18\u00b77 inches; 1871-72, 18\u00b74 inches; 1872-73, 24 inches; 1873-74, 18 inches; 1874-75, 24\u00b74 inches; 1875-76, 30\u00b76 inches; 1876-77, 24\u00b75 inches; 1877-78, 34\u00b79 inches; 1878-79, 25\u00b73 inches; 1879-80, 8\u00b76 inches; 1880-81, 15\u00b73 inches; 1881-82, 13\u00b79 inches: annual average, 19\u00b764 inches.\n\nThe health of the cantonment and civil station, which formerly bore a bad reputation, has materially improved of late years, owing to the introduction of a better water-supply. In the District, small-pox, fevers, and bowel complaints form the principal endemic diseases. The number of recorded deaths from all causes reported in 1882 amounted to 3178, or 17 per thousand; but these figures cannot be regarded as trustworthy. Of the total, 2262 were assigned to fever, and 316 to small-pox. The 3 Government charitable dispensaries at Koh\u00e1t, Hangu, and Teri afforded relief in 1882 to 30,052 persons, of whom 821 were in-patients. [For further information regarding Koh\u00e1t, see the forthcoming Gazetteer of Koh\u00e1t District, to be published by the authority of the Punjab Government in the course of the present year (1885).

Area, 803 square miles. Population (1881) 65,245, namely, males 37,249, and females 27,996; average density, 81 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion\u2014Muhammadans numbered 59,711; Hindus, 3901; Sikhs, 1566; and \u2018others,\u2019 67. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a35,171. The administrative staff, including head-quarters offices, comprises a Deputy Commissioner, with 4 Assistant or extra-Assistant Commissioners, 1 tahsild\u00e1r, 1 munsif, and 4 honorary magistrates. These officers preside over 9 civil and 10 criminal courts; number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 5; strength of regular police, 148 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 79.\n\nKoh\u00e1t.\u2014Town, municipality, military cantonment, and administrative head-quarters of Koh\u00e1t District, Punjab. Situated in lat. 33\u00b0 35' 35\" N., and long. 71\u00b0 28' 43\" E., near the north bank of the Koh\u00e1t Toi river, 2 miles from the southern base of the Afridi Hills. Distant from Peshawar 37 miles south, from Bannu 84 miles north-east, from Rawal Pindi\n105 miles west. Elevation above sea-level, 1767 feet. Population (1868), including cantonments, 11,274. Population (1881)\u2014town and suburbs, 13,490; cantonments, 4689; total, 18,179; namely, Muhammadans, 13,752; Hindus, 2798; Sikhs, 1562; and \u2018others,\u2019 67. Number of houses, 2061. The present town lies in an amphitheatre of hills, at some distance from the old site. Built on undulating ground, with excellent natural drainage. One good main street; the remainder are tortuous alleys, often ending in culs-de-sac. Surrounded by a slight wall, 12 feet in height. Government schoolhouse; jail. Small trade, but of relative importance as the chief mart for the hill tribes, who bring down grass and firewood. Manufacture of gun and rifle barrels, at a village near the site of the old town.\n\nThe cantonment and civil station lie to the east and north-east of the native town, occupying an elevated site. There is accommodation for about 3000 troops, including a battery of artillery, 1 regiment of cavalry, and 3 regiments of infantry, together with a garrison company of artillery, stationed in the fort. Climate pleasant; but the water-supply is polluted, and the general unhealthiness of the station has been attributed to this cause. The fort, erected by the British Government after the annexation, stands north of the cantonment and town.\n\nMunicipal revenue in 1875\u201376, \u00a3757; the highest amount of municipal income ever realized was \u00a33477 in 1880\u201381, but this was solely due to the large trade of the town during the Afghan war. In 1882\u201383, the municipal revenue was \u00a31527, or an average of 2s. 3d. per head of population (13,490) within municipal limits.\n\n**Koh\u00e1t Toi.**\u2014River in Koh\u00e1t District, Punjab; rises beyond the British frontier, in the valley which separates the two parallel ranges of the Orakzai Hills. Issues upon British territory, in lat. 33\u00b0 36' N., and long. 71\u00b0 9' E., a little north-east of Hangu. Receives a considerable tributary, which drains the Lower Miranzai valley, and opposite Koh\u00e1t town sweeps southward, diverted by the curve of the Adam Khel Afridi Hills; fifteen miles lower down, turns eastward, and, after a further course of 17 miles, falls into the Indus, in lat. 33\u00b0 24' N., and long. 71\u00b0 51' E., 36 miles south-east of Koh\u00e1t in a straight line.\n\n**Koh\u00edst\u00e1n.**\u2014T\u00e1tluk or Sub-division of Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Area, 2652 square miles. Population (1872) 5681; (1881) 11,957. Bounded on the north by the Sehw\u00e1n Sub-division; on the east by the Jherak (Jerruck) Sub-division; on the south by the Kadeji Hills and Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed t\u00e1tluk; and on the west by the Hab river and the Kithar range. Consists of a barren and hilly tract of country, composed of outlying spurs from the Kirthar range. The southern portion merges into several extensive plains, separated by low lines of hills, which afford abundance of forage for herds of cattle from the neighbourhood of the Indus after falls of rain. The valley\nof the Mohul, 20 miles long by 10 broad, is enclosed by hills of 1000 feet altitude. The chief streams are the Hab, B\u00e1ran, and Malir. No canals exist; agriculture is all but unknown; and the Bal\u00fach\u00ed tribes live almost entirely by pasturing goats and sheep.\n\nThe population is nomadic and fluctuating, the whole taluk containing only 6 permanent villages. The Bal\u00fach\u00eds inhabit chiefly the northern portion; the N\u00famr\u00edas and Jokias, who are Sindi tribes, range over the central hills and the southern plains. As a rule, none of the people erect any buildings more substantial than a mat hut, which can be put up in a couple of hours. The N\u00famr\u00edas or 'nine men,' who are descended from a family of R\u00e1jput freebooters and exiles, are especially averse to dealings with Government, and all the tribes are great adepts at cattle-lifting.\n\nThe treasury derives no revenue from this extensive taluk, as the land-tax has been remitted for twenty years, the cost of its collection proving to be greater than the amount realized. The Government establishment consists only of a kotw\u00e1l, with the powers of a subordinate magistrate. The police force comprises 77 men, under a chief constable. The principal village is B\u00fala Kh\u00e1n's Th\u00e1no, which communicates by road with Kotri (32 miles east) and Kar\u00e1ch\u00e9 (67 miles south-west).\n\nThe ancient system of blood-feud still prevails amongst the Bal\u00fach\u00ed tribes of Kohist\u00e1n, inducing much bloodshed and internal confusion. A feud may arise from the most trivial causes, such as a wrestle, in which a man of one tribe knocks off the turban of a man belonging to another clan. The insult thus offered is supposed to extend to all the relations and tribesmen on either side, and can only be wiped out in the blood of the offender himself or his family. When the insulted tribe has thus taken vengeance for the affront, the other tribe proceeds to avenge in turn the murder of their clansman, and in this manner the quarrel may continue for many years. To check this state of things, it becomes necessary to imprison the chief of the tribe, though sometimes the injured party, whose turn it is to take revenge, so as to prevail upon him to accept a compensation in the shape of money, camels, or cattle; after which the feud dies a natural death.\n\nA former Collector relates a case in which one N\u00far Mu\u1e25ammad, an influential member of the Bar\u00e9jo tribe, seduced a Lohar\u00e1n\u00ed woman, and slew her husband. He attempted to purchase peace, but the Lohar\u00e1n\u00eds refused. He was tried for murder, but escaped through the inapplicability of English procedure to such wild and barbarous tribes. In a little time some Lohar\u00e1n\u00eds were found with arms in their hands, going to murder their enemy, and were bound over to keep the peace. Shortly afterwards, however, in 1871, his foemen met\nhim in a pass near Taung, and cut him to pieces with swords, together with his stepson. When the case came on for trial, the Bar\u00e9jos tried to implicate a third man, a Gabol, as they had a feud with that branch of the tribe also. This example will illustrate the continuance of the vendetta amongst the rude Bal\u00fach\u00ed clansmen, even after twenty-five years of British rule.\n\n**Koil.**\u2014Central northern tahsil of Al\u00edgarh District, North-Western Provinces; comprising the pargan\u00e1s of Koil, Morthal, and Barauli, and consisting for the most part of a level and well-tilled plain, watered by the Ganges Canal, and traversed by the East Indian and Oudh and Rohilkhand Railways. The tahsil is divided into unequal parts by the Grand Trunk Road, and into two still more unequal portions by the Ganges Canal. Total area, according to the Settlement Records of 1874, 356 square miles, or 227,897 acres, of which 5575 acres were held revenue free, and 53,088 acres were barren. The assessable area was 169,234 acres, of which 151,856 acres were under cultivation, and 17,378 acres cultivable. Population (1872) 230,894; (1881) 227,654, namely, males 123,029 and females, 104,625, showing a decrease of 3240 in the nine years since 1872. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 188,443; Muhammadans, 38,128; Jains, 786; and \u2018others,\u2019 297. Number of villages, 348, of which 247 contained less than five hundred inhabitants. Land revenue (Settlement Report, 1874), \u00a336,057; total Government revenue, \u00a339,662; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a357,671. In 1883, the tahsil contained, including the general head-quarters courts for the District, 4 civil and 10 criminal courts; number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 3; strength of regular police, 275 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 359.\n\n**Koil.**\u2014Town and municipality in Al\u00edgarh District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Al\u00edgarh Town.\n\n**Koil Kuntla.**\u2014T\u00e1luk or Sub-division of Karn\u00fal (Kurnool) District, Madras Presidency. Area, about 530 square miles. Population (1881) 76,296, namely, 38,196 males and 38,100 females. Hindus numbered 68,699; Muhammadans, 6420; and Christians, 1177. Villages, 86; houses, 17,747. In 1883 there were 2 criminal courts; regular police, 63 men; police stations, 9. Land revenue, \u00a323,245.\n\n**Koilpatti.**\u2014Revenue-free village in Sat\u00far t\u00e1luk, Tinnevelli District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 1213; houses, 262. Hindus numbered 1139; Muhammadans, 18; and Christians, 56. Station on the South Indian Railway, Madras to Tuticorin; market on Monday; police station.\n\nA zam\u00edn\u00edd\u00e1r\u00ed estate, consisting of 11 villages; area, 12,836 acres, paying a peshkash or permanent assessment of \u00a3323; annual revenue derived by the zam\u00edn\u00edd\u00e1r, \u00a31058.\n\n**Kok\u00far.**\u2014Celebrated spring in Kashmir State, Northern India;\nsituated at the northern base of the P\u00edr Panjal Mountain. Lat. 33\u00b0 36' N., long. 75\u00b0 19' E. Issues by six mouths from the bottom of a limestone cliff. The stream thus formed flows into the Bareng river. Thornton mentions that the Afgh\u00e1n court, when established in Kashm\u00edr, drank no other water except that of the Kok\u00far spring.\n\nKol.\u2014The name of a collection of aboriginal tribes, mainly occupying the mountainous districts and plateaux of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Division of Bengal, and found to a smaller extent in the Tributary States of Orissa, and in some Districts of the Central Provinces. Kol is a generic word for the whole group of tribes included linguistically within the term Kolarian; but it is generally applied in a more restricted sense, embracing the three principal tribes, the Munda Kols, whose home is in Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District; the Larka Kols or Hos of Sing-bh\u00fam District; and the Bh\u00famij Kols of M\u00e1nbh\u00fam. Of this latter tribe, those who live on the borders of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper recognise no distinction between themselves and the Mundas. They intermarry, and associate and coalesce in all matters indicating identity of race. The Bh\u00famij farther to the east have become too Hinduized to acknowledge the relationship; and those of Dh\u00e1lbh\u00fam on the borders of Midnapur consider themselves autochthones, and will not admit that they are in any way connected with the Mundas or Hos.\n\nOrigin.\u2014Behar, the ancient Magadha, has numerous antiquities attributed to the Cherus and Kols; and from traditions handed down, it appears that the sovereigns of the country were at one time Cherus, the people being for the most part Kols. Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton points to K\u00e1bar, the most important of the ruins in Behar attributed to the Cherus or Kols, as evidently the work of a powerful ruler, and probably the stronghold of the princes of the race. Numerous antiquities, forts, and ruins are universally ascribed by the present inhabitants of Behar to that ancient dynasty and primitive race. According to legends and texts in the Rig-veda and the Bh\u00e1gavata Pur\u00e1na, Cherus and Kols occupied the Magadha country at the time of the birth of Gautama Buddha; and it has been noticed that the sculptures at Buddh-Gaya portray not Aryan, but Turanian or Kol features. Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton states that the dominant race, the Cherus, probably accepted the doctrines of Buddha and became Aryanized, while the Kols rejected them, and adhered to the life of freedom in which they are still found. The Kols appear as the earliest historical settlers in the Gangetic valley; and they had been long established there, and had attained some advance in civilisation, when they were dislodged and driven back by the Savars, a Dravidian people, about 500 A.D.\n\nThe following description of the Kols of the present day is quoted in a condensed form from Colonel Dalton's description in his Ethnology of Bengal (Calcutta, 1872), to which admirable work the reader is\nreferred for a full account of these and the other Kolarian tribes (pp. 150 to 235).\n\n\u2018Of the great Kol empire there are now no remnants in Behar. The Cheru chiefs, on being expelled from it, fell back into what is now the Palamau Sub-division of Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1; whilst the chief seat of the Munda race is now the plateau of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper. The central table-land, on which the tribes rallied, is admirably adapted for defence. The approaches to it from the north, north-west, east, and south, are exceedingly precipitous, the paths winding up defiles which a handful of resolute men could hold against hosts of invaders. The highlands in the western and south-western direction stretch into Sarg\u00faj\u00e1 and Jashpur, uniting with the Vindhyan mountains in a western direction and the S\u00e1tpura range to the south-west. They divide the waters of the Narbad\u00e1 and Mah\u00e1nadi, forming a covered way by which fresh accessions of cognates strengthened the growing colonies of Kols on the Jh\u00e1rkhand or forest tract; and thus were founded the \u201cstrongholds of the ten chiefs,\u201d referred to in the Pur\u00e1\u00f1as, and in Colonel Wilford\u2019s essays, as the Dasarana, or ten forest forts east of the Son. These Jh\u00e1rkhand or Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur chiefs appear to have maintained their isolated and elevated defensive positions throughout the long series of Hindu dynasties, and to have come with an indifferent reputation under the Muhammadan Government.\n\n\u2018Little is found in Munda or Bh\u00famij folk-lore that throws light on the early history of the race. The families that rank highest among them have lost such traditions in the hazy fables which Hindus have invented for them. The lower classes, as a rule, declare themselves to be autochthones; and even the chiefs found their claims to be of noble birth on miracles that took place in the country which they call their fatherland. But in a manuscript account of the family of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, it is stated that the Mund\u00e1ris came to Jh\u00e1rkhand, afterwards called Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, from Pipra and P\u00e1l\u00edgarh, names that occur in the Sant\u00e1l traditions.\n\n\u2018Village Organization.\u2014The Mundas say they had no R\u00e1j\u00e1 when they first occupied Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. They formed a congeries of small confederate states. Each village had its chief, also called a m\u00fanda, literally \u201ca head\u201d in Sanskrit; and as a village often consisted of one family, the inhabitants were all of Munda dignity, and hence it became a name for the whole tribe. What the original name for the tribe in their own language may have been, I do not know; but as the Mund\u00e1ris on the plateau call themselves Konk P\u00e1t Munda, Konk or Konkp\u00e1t may have been a national denomination. They appear to have only one word for ruler, the term g\u00famk\u00ed, and they apply it to every one in authority. In M\u00e1nbh\u00fam District, the word m\u00fanda becomes mura, which is also Sanskrit, and has the same meaning. As\nthese Kols have taken up the word *munda*, the Santals have appropriated the term *manjhi*, and the Bhumijs *sirdar*. The Munda villages had each its own staff of officers; and from the customs that still prevail in most old villages, the organization that descended from primitive times appears to have been very complete. The system of government that obtained among the Mundas and Uraons of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, before their polity was disturbed by the conversion of their chief, may still be discerned in the existing organization. The country was divided into groups of twelve or more villages, called *parh\u00e1s*, each under a headman, who was generally called the *manda*. Although not recognised by the authorities in the administrative divisions of the present time, the people still acknowledge the *parh\u00e1* jurisdiction; and questions affecting their social relations are still adjusted in *parh\u00e1* conclave. Each village had, besides, its establishment of hereditary public servants, who still exist. The principal of these are the representatives of the most influential of the patriarchs. They originally formed the colony, and each is literally a pillar of the little state called *khunt*. The head of one of these *khunts* or families is the chief or *manda*, of another the *p\u00e1hn*, or priest, and there is sometimes a third called *m\u00e1hato*, the *manda*'s deputy. The headmen had no superior rights in the lands cultivated by other villagers. They were not landlords but chiefs, and they and the people acknowledging them held the soil they cultivated in virtue of being the heirs of those who first utilized it; and when it became necessary to distinguish such men from cultivators of inferior title, the former were called *bhuinh\u00e1rs*, breakers of the soil. When the Mundas and Uraons submitted to a R\u00e1ja, and all were required to contribute to his maintenance, the people in each village were divided into two classes. The more privileged, who retained the designation of *bhuinh\u00e1r*, had to give honorary attendance, and constituted the militia of the state. The remainder supplied food and raiment; but these obligations were eventually commuted for money payment or rent, and the lands cultivated by this class were called *rijhas*, or rent-paying, in contradistinction to the *bhuinh\u00e1ri*, which were, no doubt, originally rent-free. At a late period, the R\u00e1ja was allowed to hold in each village a proportion of land called *manjihas*, which was cultivated for his sole benefit; and the persons who cultivated this land for him or his assigns had lands allotted to them, subject to no other service and no rent, called *beth khet\u00e1*. Besides the above, there were lands set apart for the expenses periodically incurred in the propitiation of the national and local deities, by which means the Kols provided against the dangers that threatened their gods from impending changes of belief. The produce of the lands has never, so far as known, been appropriated to the service of the Hindu divinities, though the people contribute something yearly\ntowards the public worship of K\u00e1l\u00ed, inaugurated by the zamind\u00e1rs; if, however, the villagers were all to adopt a new religion, they would doubtless assert their right to devote the assets of what may be called their church lands to the service of the newly-adopted faith.\n\nThe Religion of the Mundas possesses a Shamanistic rather than a Fetish character. They make no images of their gods, nor do they worship symbols; but they believe that, though invisible to mortal eyes, the gods may, when propitiated by sacrifice, take up for a time their abode in places especially dedicated to them. Thus they have their \"high places\" and their \"groves\"\u2014the former, some mighty mass of rock to which man has added nothing, and from which he takes nothing; the latter, a fragment of the original forest, the trees in which have been for ages carefully protected, left when the clearance was first made, lest the sylvan gods of places, disquieted at the wholesale felling of the trees that sheltered them, should abandon the locality. Even now, if a tree is destroyed in the sacred grove (the j\u0101hir\u00e1 or sarna), the gods evince their displeasure by withholding seasonable rain. Sing Bonga, the creator and preserver, is adored as the sun. Prayer and sacrifice are made to him as to a beneficent deity, who has no pleasure in the destruction of any of his creatures, though, as a father, he chastises his erring children; and to him our gratitude is due for all the benefits we enjoy. He is said to have married Chandra Omol, or the moon, but she deceived him on one occasion and he cut her into two; but repenting of his anger, he allows her at times to shine forth in full beauty. The stars are her daughters.\n\nThe worship of the sun as the supreme deity is the foundation of the religion of the Kols in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, and also of the Ur\u00e1ons, who address him as Dharm\u00ed, the Holy One. He is not regarded as the author of sickness or calamity, but he may be invoked to avert it; and this appeal is often made, when the sacrifices to the minor deities have been unproductive. The other deities are all considered subordinate to Sing Bonga, and though they possess supernatural powers, there are cases beyond their authority; but when they are invoked in such cases, it is their duty to intercede with Sing Bonga, and so obtain for their votaries the solicited relief. This notion of the intercessional power of the minor spirits is remarkable. Chanala Desum Bonga and his wife P\u00e1ngora have been included among the minor deities of the Hos, but these are the styles under which Sing Bonga and his wife Chandra Omol desire to be worshipped by female votaries. Chanala is to women what Sing Bonga is to men.\n\nThe next in order among the gods after Sing Bonga is Marang-B\u00far\u00fa or B\u00far\u00e1 Bonga, the mountain god. The highest or most remarkable hill or rock in the neighbourhood is the shrine of this deity or spirit. The Kols evidently recognise the importance of wooded hills\nin securing the needful supply of rain; and trusting entirely to rain for irrigation, and regarding B\u00far\u00fa Bonga as the head of the heavenly water department, they naturally pay him special attention. Every third year, in most places, buffaloes are sacrificed in his honour, and fowls and goats every year. He is also invoked in sickness. In Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur a remarkable bluff, near the village of Lodhma, is the Marang-B\u00far\u00fa or Mah\u00e1-B\u00far\u00fa for a wide expanse of country. Here people of all castes assemble and sacrifice\u2014Hindus, and even Muhammadans, as well as Kols. There is no visible object of worship; the sacrifices are offered on the top of the hill, a bare semi-globular mass of rock. If animals are killed, the heads are left there, and afterwards appropriated by the p\u00e1nh, or village priest. Hindus say that the Marang-B\u00far\u00fa, as a deity, is the same as Mah\u00e1deo. They aver, however, that they cannot exist in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur without propitiating the local deities. Every village has in its vicinity a grove reputed to be a remnant of the primeval forest, left intact for the local gods when the clearing was originally made. Here Desauli, the tutelary deity of the village, and his wife, Jh\u00e1r-Era or Mab\u00far\u00fa, are supposed to sojourn when attending to the wants of their votaries. There is a Desauli for every village, whose authority does not extend beyond the boundary of the village to which his grove belongs; if a man cultivates land in another village than the one in which his home is, he must pay his devotions to the Desauli of both. The grove deities are held responsible for the crops, and are especially honoured at all the great agricultural festivals. They are also appealed to in sickness. The next in order are N\u00e1ga-Era or Naiads, who preside over tanks, wells, and any bodies of stagnant water (called Ekhir-Bonga by the Mundas); and Garh\u00e1-Era, the river goddess. They, too, are frequently, and no doubt very truly, denounced as the cause of sickness, and propitiated by sacrifices to spare the sufferers. The remaining spirits are the ancestral shades, who are supposed to hover about, doing good or evil to their descendants. They are often denounced as the cause of calamitous visitations, and propitiatory offerings are made to them; but besides, a small portion of the food prepared in every house is daily set apart for them. The ancestors are the Penates, and are called Ham-ho. The ancestors of the wife have also to be considered; they are called Horatan-ho, because sacrifices to them are always offered on the path hora, by which the old woman came as a bride to the house.\n\nThe Munda Marriages, as solemnized in most parts of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, have many ceremonies, some of which appear to have been taken from the Hindus; at all events the ceremonies I allude to are common to Hindus and aborigines, but it is not always easy to decide by whom they were originated. We may, however, safely assert that practices common to both, which are not in accordance with the ritual\nprescribed in the Vedas, are derived from the aborigines. Among Mundas having any pretensions to respectability, the young people are not allowed to arrange these affairs for themselves. Their parents settle it all for them. The pan, or purchase money paid for the bride, varies from Rs. 4 to Rs. 20 (8s. to \u00a32); but the marriage feast is very liberally provided, and as it takes place at the bride\u2019s house, the expense chiefly falls on her father.\n\n\u2018Iron-Smelting.\u2014The Kols generally understand the smelting of iron. Their country is rich in that mineral; but it is the wilder clans, the mountain Kharri\u00e1s, the B\u00eerhors, and in Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1, the As\u00fars and Agari\u00e1s, that chiefly utilize it. Those who devote themselves to it regularly pay no attention to the cultivation of the soil. The Mundas have also acquired the art of washing for gold in the streams and rivers that drain the plateau of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, or rise in the bordering hills, which are all auriferous; but the average quantity obtained is not more than suffices to give a bare subsistence to the persons employed, including men, women, and children. The richest field, Son\u00e1pet, is the valley of the Sonai river below the plateau opening on Khars\u00e1w\u00e1n. The population are all Mundas, enjoying a rich soil, a most romantic and sequestered situation, and low fixed rents. This last advantage was secured to them after the insurrection of 1831, in which they heartily joined.\n\n\u2018Food.\u2014The Hinduized Munda abstains from most meats which Hindus consider impure, but it is not safe to place a fat capon in his way. Other Mundas, and all the Hos, eat beef, mutton, goats\u2019 flesh, fowls, fish, hares, and deer. Pigs are not much relished except by the poorer classes; and the flesh of bears, monkeys, snakes, field mice, and other small game that the Ur\u00e1ons and Sant\u00e1ls affect, the Mundas and Hos do not approve of. They will take from our hands cakes, bread and the like, but not cooked rice. In regard to cooked rice, these tribes are exceedingly particular. They will leave off eating if a man\u2019s shadow passes across their food.\n\n\u2018Very few of this people have been known to take to trade as a pursuit, but the Kols of one small section of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Tam\u00e1rh, known as Tam\u00e1ri\u00e1s, form an exception. They are employed chiefly as brokers for the purchase of the produce of the wilder parts of the Kolh\u00e1n; but owing to extension of the market system, and a growing predilection on the part of the Kols for more direct dealings with the traders, the Tam\u00e1ri\u00e1s\u2019 occupation as brokers is on the wane.\n\n\u2018Property.\u2014An equal division of property amongst the sons is the prevailing custom of inheritance; but they live together as an undivided family until the youngest boy attains his majority, when the division is made. The sisters are regarded as live stock, and allotted to the brothers just as are the cattle. Thus, if a man dies, leaving three sons\nand three daughters and thirty head of cattle, on a division each son would get ten head of cattle and one sister; but should there be only one sister, they wait till she marries, and divide the pan. The pan is the price of a wife, paid by her husband to her father's family, and usually consists of about six head of cattle. In Singbh\u00fcm the pan is higher than in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, and the question of its amount is there found to affect seriously the number of marriages.\n\nCharacter, etc.\u2014The Mundas are not so truthful and open as the Hos of Singbh\u00fcm, nor so manly and honest; but the Mundas have lived for ages under conditions ill calculated to develop the good qualities for which the Hos take credit. There has been a continual struggle to maintain what they consider their rights in the land, against the adverse interest of the landlord or his assigns. The very conditions under which most of them hold their lands place them in a position of dependence and inferiority, as they have to labour for their landlord as well as pay rent to him. Moreover, they live among a people who look down on them as a degraded race, and one of whose favourite theories is, that the Kols were created to serve them. This, no doubt, must be as demoralizing as it is aggravating; and in many places the Mundas and Ur\u00e1ons have listened to it so long that they begin to accept the doctrine, and calmly subside into the position of serfdom allotted to them. The licentiousness indulged in by Mundas and Hos at their great festival is, of course, incompatible with purity and chastity, and there is no doubt that the majority of the elders are terrible sots; but in Singbh\u00fcm the rising generation show a disposition to abandon licentious habits, and it is satisfactory to know that they can be entirely weaned from them. About seven thousand Mundas have now (1872) embraced Christianity, and recently the movement has extended to the Hos of Singbh\u00fcm. One of the m\u00e1nkis, with all his family and a considerable number of his villagers, has been baptized; and, generally speaking, all those who have embraced our religion have entirely withdrawn from participation in the wild revelry of their pagan brethren. Their pastors have made this a test of their sincerity, and it is no doubt a very severe one. The women must lay aside all their trinkets, and should not be seen, even as spectators, at dances. The race generally are duller of comprehension and more difficult to teach than Hindus or Muhammadans. With the exception of those who embrace Christianity, the Mundas are usually unwilling to learn; but the Hos have of late years evinced considerable interest in education, and the progress they make is satisfactory, their anxiety to learn and wonderful diligence making up for sluggishness in intellect.\n\nKol Population.\u2014Owing to the loose use of the term Kol, which, as stated above, is in many cases applied to the whole group of tribes speaking Kolarian dialects, it was found impossible for the Census\nofficers to present any satisfactory return of the Kol population in the more restricted ethnical sense in which the word is used as referring to the Mundas, Hos, and Bh\u00famij, who make up the tribe commonly known as Kol. In the ethnical sense the Kol tribe is confined mainly to the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Districts and States, and to certain Districts in the Central Provinces. In Bengal, the Census statements for 1881 show a total number of 871,666 Kols, of whom 613,863 were returned as professing aboriginal religions, and 257,803 as Hindus. In the Central Provinces, out of a total of 78,000 Kols, 35,804 were returned as aborigines by religion, and 42,196 as Hindus. These figures show a total of 949,666 persons returned as Kols. The Bengal Census Report of 1881 states\u2014\u2018On the one hand they [the returns for the Kols] include members of various tribes which have separate names, but belong to the great Kolarian family; and on the other hand they do not include all the persons to whom the term is properly applicable, and who may have been entered with closer specification as Mundas, Hos, Bh\u00famij, or Khari\u00e1s. . . . All that can be said is, not that all the Kols are entered under that name, but only that all those who are entered as Kols are Kolarians.\u2019 In the language returns of the Census Report, the total number of persons returned as speaking Kolarian languages is 1,140,489.\n\nKol\u00e1ba.\u2014A British District in the Konk\u00e1n or Southern Division of the Bombay Presidency. Lies between 17\u00b0 52' and 18\u00b0 50' N. lat., and 73\u00b0 7' and 73\u00b0 42' E. long. Bounded on the north and north-east by the Bombay harbour, the Panwel and Karjat Sub-divisions of Th\u00e1na District, and the Amba river; on the east by the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills, the Bhor State, the territory of Pant Sachiv, and the Districts of Poona and Sat\u00e1ra; on the south and south-west by Ratn\u00e1giri; and on the west by the Janjira State and (for 18 miles) by the Arabian Sea. Area, 1496 square miles. Population (1881) 381,649; density of population, 255 persons per square mile. Land revenue (1882-83), \u00a379,896. Chief town, Alibagh.\n\nPhysical Aspect, etc.\u2014Kol\u00e1ba District is a rugged belt of country from 15 to 30 miles broad, stretching from the south of Bombay harbour to the foot of the Mah\u00e1baleshwar hills, 75 miles south-east. Situated between the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills and the sea, the District contains spurs of considerable regularity and height, running westwards at right angles to the main range, as well as isolated peaks or lofty detached ridges. A series of minor ranges also run north and south between the main range and the sea. The great wall of the Sahy\u00e1dris forms the chief natural feature. Apparently bare of vegetation, a near approach discovers well-wooded ravines and glades of evergreen forest. The sea frontage of the District, of 18 miles, is throughout the greater part of its length fringed by a belt of cocoa-nut and areca-nut palms. Behind\nthis belt is situated a stretch of flat country devoted to rice cultivation. In many places, along the banks of the salt-water creeks, there are extensive tracts of salt marsh land, some of them reclaimed, some still subject to tidal inundation, and others set apart for the manufacture of salt. A few small streams, rising in the hills to the east of the District, pass through it to the sea. Tidal inlets, of which the principal are the Amba or N\u00e1gothna in the north, the Kundalika, Roha or Chaul in the west, the M\u00e1nd\u00e1d in the south-west, and the S\u00e1vitra or B\u00e1nkot creek in the south, run inland for 25 or 30 miles, forming highways for a brisk trade in rice, salt, firewood, and dried fish. The creek of the Pen river is navigable to Antora, 4 miles from Pen, for boats of seven tons (28 khandis) during ordinary tides, and to boats of thirty-five tons (140 khandis) during spring tides. Near the coast especially, the District is well supplied with reservoirs. Some of these are handsomely built of cut stone; but none are very large, and only a few hold water throughout the year. The Alibagh reservoir, built in 1876, has an area of 7 acres and a depth of 20 feet. The well water of the coast villages is somewhat brackish, and the supply near the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills is very defective. Hot springs are found at Unheri, Son, and Kondivi.\n\nOn spurs of the Sahy\u00e1dri range are two remarkable peaks.\u2014Raig\u00e1rbh (R\u00e1ygad), in the Mah\u00e1d Sub-division, where Sivaji built his capital; and Mir\u00e1dongar, a station of the Trigonometrical Survey. Two passes in the range are suitable for wheeled traffic, the Fitzgerald pass and the Varandha pass, the roads of which unite in the trading town of Mah\u00e1d. There are several minor passes adapted for foot passengers.\n\nThe teak and blackwood forests of Kol\u00e1ba are very valuable. The Kol\u00e1ba teak (Tectona grandis) has by competent judges been pronounced the best grown in the Konk\u00e1n, and inferior only to that of Calicut. The value of the forests is increased by their proximity to Bombay, for they may be said to lie around the mouth of the harbour. The curved knees are particularly adapted for the building of small vessels. The timber trade of the District has two main branches,\u2014an inland trade in wood for building purposes, and a coast trade in firewood and crooks for shipbuilding. The area under the Forest Department in 1881 was about 153 square miles. During the nine years ending 1878, the forest revenue has increased from \u00a32488 (1871\u201372) to \u00a39194 (1877\u201378), averaging a little over \u00a35000. Since the augmentation of the forest staff in 1878, the charges have been greater than the revenue. In 1880\u201381, the gross forest revenue of Kolaba District amounted to \u00a35152. The only mineral known to occur is iron. Road-metalling is abundant, and sand is found in all the creeks.\n\nTigers and leopards are found all over the District, and bears on the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills. Hyenas and jackals abound. Bison, simbhar, and cheetah have been shot, but are very rare. Serviceable ponies and\ngoats are numerous. In the coast villages, the fishermen cure large quantities of fish for export to Bombay by the inland creeks. The sea fisheries, especially of the Alib\u00e1gh villages, are of considerable importance, and afford a livelihood to 6800 fishermen in the District. The chief species caught, mostly by means of stake-nets, are *pomphlet*, *bamelo* or *bombil*, *haliva*, and others. A row of stakes with its accompanying net costs about \u00a330.\n\nKol\u00e1ba island formed in ancient times a shelter for the piratical fleets of Western India. The island is situated just outside Alib\u00e1gh harbour, about a furlong from the shore, and was in the last century the stronghold of the Angri\u00e1 family. In 1662, Sivaj\u00ed rebuilt and strengthened Kol\u00e1ba fort, and converted it into a regular buccaneering stronghold. In 1722, a combined expedition of British ships and Portuguese troops made an unsuccessful attack upon it. Kol\u00e1ba fort continued to be an active scene of Angri\u00e1\u2019s operations, and survived the sharp measures of Clive against that chief. In 1771, Forbes describes it as still an important place, where the Angri\u00e1 of that day lived in much splendour. The rise of the Indian navy during the second half of the last century put an end to piracy on an organized scale in Bombay waters.\n\n**History.**\u2014Hindu, Muhammadan, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1, and British rulers have, as throughout most of the peninsula, in turn administered the District of Kol\u00e1ba. But it is the rise, daring, and extinction of the pirate power of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Angri\u00e1 that vest the history of this part of the Konk\u00e1n with a peculiar interest.\n\nThe early rulers were most probably local chiefs. Shortly after the beginning of the Christian era, the semi-mythical Andrabhritya dynasty, whose capital was Kolh\u00e1pur, were the over-lords of Kol\u00e1ba. About this time (135 A.D. to 150 A.D.), the Greek geographer Ptolemy describes the region of Kol\u00e1ba under the name of Symulla or Timulla, most likely the Chaul of later days. In Ptolemy\u2019s time the Shata Karnis or Andrabhrityas were ruling in the Konk\u00e1n as well as in the Deccan; and for many years the ports on the Kol\u00e1ba seaboard were the emporia of a large traffic, not only inland, over the Sahy\u00e1dri passes across the peninsula to Bengal, but by way of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf to Egypt, Arabia, and Abyssinia. In the sixth century Kol\u00e1ba, with all the northern Konk\u00e1n, came under the sway of the Ch\u00e1lukyas, whose general, Channa-danda, sweeping the Mauryas or local rulers before him \u2018like a great wave,\u2019 captured the Maurya citadel Puri, \u2018the goddess of the fortunes of the western ocean.\u2019 In the thirteenth century, by which time the rule of the Ch\u00e1lukyas had passed away, the District was held by the Deogiri (Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d) Yad\u00e1vas.\n\nImmediately prior to the appearance of the Muhammadans, tradition assigns to Kol\u00e1ba a dynasty of K\u00e1nara kings. Nothing, however, is\nknown about them. The B\u00e1hmanis, who ruled from 1347 to 1489, reduced the whole Konk\u00e1n to obedience, and held Chaul as well as other posts in Kol\u00e1ba District. The B\u00e1hmani dynasty was followed by kings from Gujar\u00e1t. A period of Portuguese ascendancy established at Chaul (1507\u20131660) preceded the rise of the Angri\u00e1s, and was partly contemporaneous with the conquest of all the rest of the District by the Mughals and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The Mughals, who acquired the sovereignty in 1600, were in 1632 ousted by Sh\u00e1bj\u00ed Bhonsla, father of Sivaji, the founder of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 conquest. Sivaji built two small forts near Ghasale and R\u00e1igarh, repaired the great strongholds of Suvarndr\u00fag and Vijayadr\u00fag, which stand on the coast-line below Bombay; and in 1674 caused himself to be enthroned at R\u00e1igarh. Nine years after Sivaji\u2019s death, in 1680, the seizure of R\u00e1igarh restored control of the country to the Mughals. The period of the Angri\u00e1s, who terrorized the coast while the Muhammadans were powerful inland, lasted for one hundred and fifty years\u2014from 1690 to 1840, when K\u00e1nhoj\u00ed II. died in infancy and the country was taken over by the British.\n\nK\u00e1nhoj\u00ed, the first of the Angri\u00e1s, was in 1698 the admiral of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 fleet, having his head-quarters at Kol\u00e1ba, an island-fort close to Alib\u00e1gh and within two or three miles of the present city of Bombay. From here he had long harassed shipping on the coast from Malab\u00e1r to Bombay; in 1713 he threw off his allegiance to the Peshw\u00e1, and having defeated and captured his suzerain, set up an independent rule in ten forts and sixteen minor posts along the Konk\u00e1n coasts. Having conquered the Sid\u00eds of Janjira, his rivals in buccaneering, K\u00e1nhoj\u00ed with a considerable fleet of vessels, ranging from 150 to 200 tons burthen, swept the seas from his fort of Vijayadr\u00fag. In 1717, his first piracies against English trade occurred. In retaliation the English assaulted Vijayadr\u00fag, but the assault was beaten off. On two occasions within the next four years, K\u00e1nhoj\u00ed withstood the combined attacks of English and Portuguese. On his death in 1731, the Angri\u00e1 chief-ship was weakened by division between K\u00e1nhoj\u00ed\u2019s two sons, of whom Sambhoj\u00ed Angri\u00e1 was the more enterprising and able. Sambhoj\u00ed was succeeded in 1748 by Tulaj\u00ed; and from now until the fall of Vijayadr\u00fag before the allied forces of the Peshw\u00e1 and the British Government at Bombay, both English and Dutch commerce suffered severely from the Angri\u00e1 pirates.\n\nIn 1756, the fort of Vijayadr\u00fag was captured by Admiral Watson and Colonel (afterwards Lord) Clive, who commanded the land forces. Fifteen hundred prisoners were taken, eight English and three Dutch captains were rescued from the underground dungeons in the neighbourhood of the fortress, and treasure to the value of \u00a3125,000 was divided among the captors. Vijayadr\u00fag was handed over to the Peshw\u00e1, under whom piracy flourished as vigorously as under the Angri\u00e1s. Under the\nPeshw\u00e1, Manaji and Raghoj\u00ed, the descendants of an illegitimate branch of the first Angri\u00e1s, held Kol\u00e1ba fort as feudatories of Poona. On the fall of the Peshw\u00e1\u2019s rule in 1818, the allegiance of the Angri\u00e1s was transferred to the British. In 1840, the death of K\u00e1nhoj\u00ed II., the last representative of the original Angri\u00e1s, afforded an opportunity to the Bombay Government to annex the forts of Suvarndr\u00fag, Vijayadr\u00fag, and Kol\u00e1ba. The District has since enjoyed unbroken peace.\n\nKol\u00e1ba District, with the exception of the Sub-division of Alib\u00e1gh, formed part of the dominions of the Peshw\u00e1, annexed by the Bombay Government in 1818, on the overthrow of B\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o. Alib\u00e1gh lapsed to the Paramount Power in 1840. Kol\u00e1ba island has still an evil reputation with mariners, as the scene of many wrecks. Full nautical details regarding it are given in Taylor\u2019s Sailing Directions. Many houses in the town are built from the driftwood of vessels which have gone ashore. Ships are sometimes supposed to be intentionally wrecked here; the coast near Alib\u00e1gh presents fair facilities for the escape of the crews.\n\nPopulation.\u2014In 1872, the population of the District was returned at 350,405. The Census returns of 1881 disclosed a total population of 381,649 persons, residing in 974 towns and villages, and 71,930 occupied and 7335 unoccupied houses; density of the population, 255 persons per square mile; houses per square mile, 52.9; persons per village, 392; persons per house, 5.30. The population has thus increased 31,244 since 1872, or nearly 9 per cent., in nine years. Classified according to sex, there are 191,952 males and 189,697 females; proportion of males, 50.29 per cent. Classified according to age, there are, under 15 years, 81,554 boys and 74,602 girls; total children, 156,156, or 40 per cent. of the population. The religious division shows 360,117 Hindus, 17,891 Musalm\u00e1ns, 1164 Jains, and 33 P\u00e1rs\u00eds. Of the remainder, 2139 are Jews (Beni-Israel), and 305 Christians. The Hindus, who form 94 per cent. of the population, include\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 13,789; R\u00e1jputs, 167; Ag\u00e1rias, 44,191; Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds, 5982; Cham\u00e1rs, 6248; Darj\u00eds, 1637; Dhob\u00eds (washermen), 1566; N\u00e1pits (barbers), 3153; Kunb\u00eds (cultivators), 159,335; Kol\u00eds (gardeners), 14,869; Kumbh\u00e1rs (potters), 3732; Ling\u00e1yats (mostly shopkeepers), 1463; Mal\u00eds (gardeners), 11,260; Mangs and Mhars (inferior castes), 34,847; Son\u00e1rs (goldsmiths), 5229; Sut\u00e1rs (carpenters), 3670; Tel\u00eds (oilmen), 844; Gaulis (cowherds), 7332; Dh\u00e1ngars (shepherds), 3543; Jangams, 1286; Loh\u00e1rs, 328; and \u2018other\u2019 Hindus, 35,646. The Muhammadan tribes are thus distributed\u2014Path\u00e1ns, 401; Sayyids, 162; Shaikhs, 17,230; and \u2018other\u2019 Muhammadans, 98.\n\nClassified according to occupation, the males are placed in the Census under the following six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every kind and the learned professions, 3166;\n(2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 3945; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 2911; (4) agricultural class, including shepherds and gardeners, 83,052; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 13,131; and (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 85,747.\n\nKolaba contains the following six towns, namely\u2014Pen (population, 8082); Rewadanda (6908); Mahad (6804); Alibagh (6376); Chaurl (5355); Roha-Ashtami (4894). Of the places of interest the following may be mentioned\u2014the Kuda and Pale caves, and Raigarh and Kolaba forts. Of the 975 towns and villages in the District in 1881, 354 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 429 from two to five hundred; 140 from five hundred to one thousand; 41 from one to two thousand; 2 from two to three thousand; 4 from three to five thousand; and 5 from five to ten thousand.\n\nAmong Hindus, the most important classes are the Brahmins, who own large gardens and palm groves along the coast. In the south they are the landlords or khots of many villages, holding the position of middlemen between Government and the actual cultivators.\n\nOf the hill tribes, there are the Thakurs and Kothkaris; of unsettled tribes, the Vadars and the Banjaras. The Thakurs (3629) are small squat men, with hard irregular features, in some degree redeemed by an honest, kindly expression. They speak Marathi; they are honest, harmless, and hard-working, the women doing quite as much work as the men. When not employed on land cultivation, they find stray jobs or gather firewood for sale. The Kothkaris (10,292) are cultivators, labourers, and firewood sellers. Their women, tall and slim, singularly dirty and unkempt, are hard workers, and help the men by hawking headloads of firewood. Kothkaris, as a rule, are much darker and slimmer than the other forest tribes; they rank among the lowest of the low, their very touch being thought to defile. They eat every sort of flesh, except the cow and the brown-faced monkey. They are poor, and much given to drinking. The Vadars (232) are rude, intemperate, and unsettled in their habits, gathering wherever building is going on. They are quarry-men, and make grindstones, hand-mills, and rolling pins. They dig wells and ponds, and trade in and carry salt and grain. They are poor, living from hand to mouth.\n\nThe Beni-Israel, or Indian Jews, are chiefly found in the seaboard tracts. They are of two classes, the white and black; the white, according to their own story, are descended from the original immigrants; while the black are descendants of converts or of women of the country. A considerable number of them enlist in the native army, and are esteemed as soldiers. They maintain the rite of circumcision, and faithfully accept the Old Testament. Their social and religious\ndiscipline is administered by elders, the chief of whom are called K\u00e1d\u2019s. Their home language is Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, but in the synagogues their scriptures are read in Hebrew. The Jews monopolize the work of oil-pressing to so great an extent, that they are generally known as oilmen or telis. The late Dr. Wilson was of opinion that the Beni-Israel are descended from the lost tribes, founding his belief upon the fact that they possessed none of the Jewish names which date after the captivity, and none of the Jewish scriptures or writings after that date.\n\nSome of the Musalm\u00e1ns are the descendants of converted Hindus; others trace their origin to foreign invaders; and a few are said to represent the early Arab traders and settlers. But of these last there is not, so low down the western coast, any distinct community, and there are few families that have not intermarried with Musalm\u00e1ns of the country.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Agriculture is the most important industry of Kol\u00e1ba District; the total agricultural population in 1881 was returned at 147,525, giving an average of 3'4 cultivable and cultivated acres per head. The total number, however, dependent on the soil amounted to 258,641, or 67'77 per cent. of the District population. Of the total District area of 1496 square miles, 804 square miles are assessed for revenue. Of these, 792 square miles are under cultivation; 12 square miles are cultivable; and 692 non-revenue-paying. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses on land, \u00a377,909, or an average of 3s. 0\u00bed. per cultivated acre.\n\nThere are four descriptions of soil:\u2014(1) Alluvial, composed of various disintegrated rocks of the overlying trap formation, with a larger or smaller proportion of calcareous substance. This is by far the richest variety, and occupies the greater portion of the District. (2) Soil formed by the disintegration of laterite and trap, covering the slopes of the hills and plateaux. Though fitted for the cultivation of some crops, such as n\u00e1gliwari and hemp, this soil, owing to its shallowness, soon becomes exhausted, and has to be left fallow for a few years. (3) Clayey mould, resting upon trap, called kh\u00e1r\u00e1p\u00e1t or salt land. (4) Soil containing marine deposits, a large portion of sand, and other matter in concretion. This last lies immediately upon the sea-coast, and is favourable for garden crops.\n\nA peculiarity of Kol\u00e1ba District is the khoti tenure, which exists in 485 villages. The khot was originally a mere farmer of the revenue from year to year, but this right to act as middleman became hereditary, although he had no proprietary right. Under the Survey, the khot, as peasant proprietor, pays the survey rates; while the actual cultivators pay rent to the khot, not exceeding an excess of 50 per cent. above the Government demand, and this constitutes the profit of the khot.\n\nThe agricultural stock in the District amounted in 1881\u201382 to 29,902\nploughs, 2938 carts, 50,305 bullocks, 40,310 cows, 39,398 buffaloes, 447 horses, 15,307 sheep and goats, 41 asses. Of 483,096 acres, the total area of Government cultivable land, 476,643 acres, or 98\u00b766 per cent., were taken up for cultivation in 1881\u201382. Of these, 168,731 acres were under grass or occupied by salt-pans; of the remainder, 307,912 acres were under actual tillage, 5259 of which were twice cropped. Food-grains covered 287,267 acres, or 93\u00b723 per cent. of the cultivated area; pulses, 16,572, or 5\u00b738 per cent.; oil seeds, 4902, or 1\u00b759 per cent.; fibres, 1587, or 0\u00b751 per cent.; and miscellaneous crops, 2843 acres, or 0\u00b792 per cent. Rice of many varieties, occupying 141,835 acres, or 46\u00b706 per cent. of the area actually under cultivation in 1881\u201382, is the staple produce of the District, and forms the chief article of export. The finest varieties are called kolamba and ambaver, after them patni, nirpunj, and bodak, otherwise called kothimbre.\n\nRice is grown on saline as well as on sweet land. Between December and May, the plot of ground chosen for a nursery is covered with cow-dung and brushwood; this is overlaid with thick grass, and earth is spread over the surface; the whole is then set fire to on the leeward side, generally towards morning, after the heavy dew has collected. In June, after the land has been sprinkled by a few showers, the nursery is sown and then ploughed. The plants shoot up after a few heavy falls of rain. In the beginning of July, the seedlings are planted out at a distance of from 3 to 10 inches apart in fields previously ploughed and cleared. The land is weeded from time to time. Between October and November, the reaping commences. The cut crop is left on the field, where it is spread out to dry more perfectly; it is afterwards tied up in sheaves and built into a stack. After a month or so, the threshing commences. A small piece of hard ground (sometimes a rock) is selected, and the sheaves are then beaten against the ground, the straw being kept for fodder or thatch. The winnowing follows, which is effected by filling a flat shovel-shaped basket with grain, and slowly emptying it from as great a height as the upraised arms can reach. In saline land no plough is used, neither is the soil manured. In the beginning of June, when the ground has become thoroughly saturated, the seed is either sown in the mud, or wherever the land is low and subject to the overflow of rain-water. No transplanting takes place, but thinning is done when necessary. Should a field by any accident be flooded by salt water for three years in succession, the crops would be deteriorated.\n\nEspecially in the northern Sub-divisions, Alibagh and Pen, the most interesting feature in the tillage of Kolaba District is the large area of salt marsh and mangrove swamps that has been reclaimed for the growth of rice. These tracts, situated along the banks of tidal creeks, are locally known as kh\u00e4repit or saline land. Most of the embankments or\nshilotris, which save the land from tidal flooding, are said to have been built between 1755 and 1780 under the Angri\u00e1s by men of position and capital, who, with the title of shilotrid\u00e1rs or dam-keepers, undertook, on the grant of special terms, to make the embankments and to keep them in repair. For many years these reclamations were divided into rice-fields and salt-pans. The salt-pans were gradually closed between 1858 and 1872; and about two-thirds of the area formerly devoted to salt-making has now been brought under tillage. Each reclamation has two banks, an outer and an inner. In the outer bank are sluice-gates which are kept closed from October to June; and, as soon as the rains set in, are opened to allow the rain water to escape. Two years after the embankment is completed, rice is sown in the reclaimed land, in order that the decayed straw may offer a resting-place, and supply nourishment to grass seeds. Five years generally elapse before any crop is raised. More than 9000 acres have been reclaimed in this way. The reclamation of saline land is encouraged by no revenue being levied for the first ten years, and full revenue only after thirty years.\n\nThe inferior kinds of grain called nachni (Eleusine corocana), wari (Panicum miliaceum), harik (Paspalum scrobiculatum), which form the chief food-supply of the people, are also grown in considerable quantities, especially on the flat tops and terraced sides of the hills. Cotton, now rarely grown, was cultivated with considerable success during the great development of the production of Indian cotton at the close of last century.\n\nA skilled labourer earns from 1s. to 2s. a day; unskilled, from 3\u00bdd. to 6d.; cart hire per day, from 1s. 6d. to 2s.; boat (machw\u00e1s) hire per day, from 10s. to 16s. The current prices of the chief articles of food during 1881 were, for a rupee\u2014rice, 24 lbs.; wheat, 21 lbs.; d\u00e1l (split peas), 19 lbs.; h\u00e1jra, 28 lbs.; and gram, 25 lbs.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The oldest scarcity of which local memory remains was the famine of 1803. The distress caused by want of rain and failure of crops was increased by the influx of starving people from the Deccan. Many children are said to have been sold for food. The price of rice rose to about two pounds the rupee. To relieve distress, entire remissions of revenue, during periods varying from eight months to two years, were granted. In 1817\u201318, there was a great scarcity of food, approaching to a famine. In 1848, in the old Sankshi division, part of the rice crop on saline land was damaged by unusually high spring-tides. Remissions were granted to the amount of \u00a33775. In 1852, heavy rain damaged grain and other produce stacked in the fields. In 1854, an exceedingly good harvest was the outcome of a most favourable rainfall. But, on 1st of November, a terrible hurricane completely destroyed every sort of field produce, whether standing or stacked, felling also cocoa-nut and areca-nut plantations. Remissions to the\namount of more than \u00a31200 were granted. In 1871 there was a serious drought, particularly in the southern half of the District. In 1875-76, and in 1876-77, floods did much damage to the same tract. In 1878-79, the cold-weather crops were damaged by locusts.\n\nTrade, etc.\u2014The principal trade centres of the District are Pen, N\u00e1gothna, Rew\u00e1danda, Roha, Ghodeg\u00e1on, and Mah\u00e1d. The chief articles of export are rice, salt, firewood, timber, vegetables, fruits, and dried fish. The imports consist of Malab\u00e1r teak, brass pots from Poona and N\u00e1sik, dates, grain, piece-goods, oil, butter, garlic, potatoes, turmeric, sugar, and molasses. The local manufactures barely suffice for local wants. Salt is extensively made by evaporation, and its production furnishes profitable employment in the fair season, when the cultivators are not engaged in agriculture. The weaving of silk\u2014a relic of Portuguese times\u2014is practised at Chaul; but the manufacture has declined since 1668, about which time a migration of weavers took place, and the first street was built in Bombay to receive them. The extraction of oil from til (Sesamum), the cocoa-nut, and the ground-nut, and the preparation of cocoa-nut fibre, also support many families. The District appears on the whole to be well supplied with means of transporting and exporting produce, a great portion being within easy reach of water-carriage. There are 13 seaports in the District: during the eight years ending 1881-82, the total value of sea-borne trade averaged \u00a3285,916, being\u2014imports \u00a3100,218, and exports \u00a3185,698. In 1881-82, the imports were valued at \u00a393,617; exports, \u00a3174,459; total value, \u00a3268,076. Minor markets and fairs are held periodically at twenty-three places in the District. The yearly rate of interest varies from 6 to 24 per cent. Baniyas from Marwar and Gujarat are the chief shopkeepers and money-lenders.\n\nCommunications.\u2014In 1881 there were 12 roads in the District, with a total length of 187 miles; 139 miles of this number are unbridged fair-weather roads. The Amba is crossed at Kol\u00e1d by a ferry. The number of toll-bars is eight, five of them placed on the Mahabaleshwar Trunk Road. The largest bridge in the District is one of 56 spans at Mang\u00e1on, across the Niz\u00e1mpur-K\u00e1l. At N\u00e1gothna there is a masonry bridge, built in 1580 at a cost of three l\u00faks of rupees, to facilitate the march of the Ahmadnagar kings\u2019 troops into Chaul. A steam ferry plies daily between Bombay harbour, Revas, and Dharambar. The chief passes across the Sahy\u00e1dris are\u2014the P\u00e1r, the Fitzgerald, the Varandha, the Umbarda, and K\u00e1v\u00e1lya. The only lighthouse in Kol\u00e1ba District stands on the highest point of the island of Kh\u00e1ndari or Kenery, a small island near the entrance of the Bombay harbour, 11 miles south of Bombay. Lat. 18\u00b0 42' 8\" N., long. 72\u00b0 48' 17\" E. It consists of an octagonal tower 75 feet high from base to vane, built on a flat roofed house, with a single fixed white dioptric light of the first order, which\nin clear weather is visible for 20 miles from the deck of a ship. The height of the lantern above high water is 161 feet, and its area of illumination is 225\u00b0 of the horizon.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Kol\u00e1ba was first attached to Ratn\u00e1giri and then to Th\u00e1na District. In 1853 it was made a Sub-collectorate, and in 1869 an independent District. For administrative purposes Kol\u00e1ba is divided into 5 Sub-divisions. The gross revenue in 1882-83 amounted to \u00a3107,611, showing, on a population of 381,649, an incidence per head of 5s. 7\u00bdd. The land-tax forms the principal source of income, yielding \u00a379,896. Other important items are stamps, forest, and local dues. The latter, created since 1863 for works of public utility and rural education, yielded (1881) a total sum of \u00a37976. There are 4 municipalities\u2014Alib\u00e1gh, Pen, Roha-Ashtami, Mah\u00e1d\u2014containing an aggregate population of 26,156 persons, and having (1882) an income of \u00a32415. The incidence of municipal taxation varies from 1s. 0\u00bdd. to 1s. 9d. per head. The administration of the District is entrusted to a Collector and two Assistants, of whom one is a covenanted civilian.\n\nKol\u00e1ba is included in the local jurisdiction of the Judge of Th\u00e1na. For the settlement of civil disputes there are 5 civil judges, and the number of suits decided in 1881-82 was 3242. Fourteen officers share the administration of criminal justice. The total strength of the regular police in 1881 consisted of 346 officers and men, giving 1 man to every 4'32 square miles, or to every 1103 persons. Total cost, \u00a35418, equal to \u00a33, 12s. 5d. per square mile of area, and 4d. per head of the population. The number of persons convicted of any offence, great or small, was 923, being 1 person to every 413 of the population. There are 14 post-offices in the District. In 1855-56 there was only 1 school, attended by 108 pupils; in 1881-82 there were 79 schools, attended by 4990 pupils, or an average of 1 school for every 12 inhabited villages.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014There are four distinct climatic periods\u2014the rains from June to October; the damp hot weather in October and November on the cessation of the rains; the cold weather from December to March; and the dry hot weather from March to June. In the region about Alib\u00e1gh there is said to be always a sea-breeze. The time of the rains is considered the healthy period of the year. Bagaly\u00e1s, or devils, is the local name given to the sudden, short, and violent hot dust storms that occur. The number of deaths registered in 1881 was 7723, at the rate of 20'23 per thousand of the population. Average rainfall during five years ending 1881, 83 inches. The minimum temperature during the period 1875-1879 was 72'6\u00b0 F., and the maximum 91'3\u00b0. In 1881, 3 dispensaries afforded medical relief to 207 in-door and 24,428 out-door patients. [For further information regarding Kol\u00e1ba District, see the Bombay Gazetteer, compiled under\nthe orders of the Government of Bombay, by Mr. J. M. Campbell, C.S., vol. vi., Kol\u00e1ba and Janjira (Government Central Press, Bombay, 1883). Also the Settlement Report of Kol\u00e1ba District, by Major J. T. Francis (1863); the Bombay Census Report for 1881; and the several Annual Administration and Departmental Reports of the Presidency from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nKol\u00e1ba.\u2014Point or spur of land protecting the entrance to Bombay harbour on the north, and comprised within the limits of the city of Bombay. It was originally a chain of small islands, now connected with each other and with the island of Bombay by causeways and reclaimed tracts. The northern portion of Kol\u00e1ba contains docks, factories, and other important commercial and industrial buildings of Bombay city; it is also the terminus of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway. In the centre are the quarters of the European garrison of Bombay city; and at the southern point, about 2\u00bd miles south-west by south from Bombay Castle, are the lunatic asylum, the observatory, and the old lighthouse, for which was substituted in 1874 a lighthouse with first-class flashing dioptric light, about a mile seaward of the old lighthouse, on the 'Prongs,' a dangerous reef running south from Kol\u00e1ba Point.\n\nKol\u00e1bir\u00e1.\u2014Zamind\u00e1ri estate in Sambalpur District, Central Provinces; situated in the north-east corner of the District, bordering on B\u00e1mr\u00e1 and Gangpur States. Population (1881) 31,246, namely, males 15,877, and females 15,369, chiefly agriculturists, residing in 242 villages and 7194 houses, on an area of 231 square miles, of which two-thirds are cultivated. Products\u2014rice, pulses, oil-seeds, sugar-cane, and cotton. Principal villages\u2014Kol\u00e1bir\u00e1 (lat. 21\u00b0 48' N., long. 84\u00b0 12' 30\" E.; population in 1881, 790), which contains a good school; and Raghun\u00e1thpalli, with a population of about 1100. The estate was created in the time of Jeth Singh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sambalpur, about 1760. During the Mutiny of 1857 the chief was hanged, and his son died an outlaw; but the estate was restored to the family after the amnesty. Estimated income of the zamind\u00e1r, \u00a3309; tribute payable to Government, \u00a3109. The old road from Sambalpur town to Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur traverses the estate.\n\nKol\u00e1chel (Colachy-Coleci\u2014Bartolomeo; possibly the K\u00f3lias of Strabo).\u2014Town in Travancore State, Madras Presidency. Lat. 8\u00b0 10' N., and long. 77\u00b0 19' E., in the southernmost corner of India; containing 1038 houses and (1875) 4768 inhabitants. Not returned in the Census Report of 1881. A place of yearly increasing importance. South Travancore coffee is here prepared and exported. Kol\u00e1chel is now a regular port for coasting steamers. Since 1870, the annual tonnage of ships calling has increased from 4000 to 37,000. The imports are valued at \u00a313,500, the exports at \u00a368,000; of the latter, 85 per cent.\nrepresent the trade in coffee. The port was of value some centuries ago, and was occupied by the Danes; it is referred to by Bartolomeo as a safe harbour well known to the ancients.\n\n**Koladyne.**\u2014River in Akyab District, British Burmah.\u2014See Kuladan.\n\n**Kolair.**\u2014Lake in Kistna and God\u00e1vari Districts, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Kolar.\n\n**Kolak.**\u2014Port in the P\u00e1rdi Sub-division of Surat District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. $20^\\circ 27' 30''$ N., long. $72^\\circ 57'$ E. Situated at the mouth of the Kolak river, where the channel is 498 feet broad, and can only be crossed by boats. Vessels of 60 tons can enter and find a good landing. Beyond the bar are the beds of oysters for which the Kolak is famous. About eight miles up the river the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway has a bridge 438 feet long and 33 feet high. Value of trade for the year 1874\u2014imports \u00a31255, and exports \u00a33232; no later statistics are available.\n\n**Kolakamb\u00e1i.**\u2014River, coffee-growing tract, hill peak (5600 feet above sea-level), with a waterfall north-east of the peak, having an unbroken fall of 400 feet, in the District of the Nilgiri Hills, Madras Presidency.\n\n**Kolang** (*Kolong*).\u2014Village in the L\u00e1hul tract of Kangra District, Punjab; situated on the right bank of the Bh\u00e1ga river, about ten miles above Kyelang. One of the principal places in L\u00e1hul, and the residence of the Th\u00e1kur or head-man (*negi*) of the whole L\u00e1hul valley.\n\n**Kol\u00e1r.**\u2014District in the Native State of Mysore, forming the eastern portion of the Nandidr\u00fag (Nundydroog) Division. It is situated between $12^\\circ 46'$ and $13^\\circ 36'$ N. lat., and between $78^\\circ 5'$ and $78^\\circ 35'$ E. long.; bounded on the north and north-east by Bellary and Cuddapah Districts, on the south-east and south by North Arcot and Salem Districts, and on the west by Bangalore and T\u00famk\u00far Districts of Mysore. It contains an area of 1891 square miles, and a population, according to the Census of 1881, of 461,129 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at Kolar town, 6 miles from the right bank of the P\u00e1l\u00e1r river.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Kol\u00e1r District occupies that portion of the Mysore table-land immediately bordering the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts. The principal watershed lies in the north-west, around the hill of Nandidr\u00fag, rising to 4810 feet above the sea, from which rivers radiate in all directions; and the whole country is broken by numerous hill ranges. The chief rivers are the P\u00e1l\u00e1r, the South Pin\u00e1kini or Penn\u00e1r, the North Pinakini, and the P\u00e1paghn\u00ed, which are industriously utilized for irrigation by means of anicuts and tanks. In no other part of Mysore has the tank system been more fully developed. The entire water-supply of the P\u00e1l\u00e1r is thus intercepted, while of the North Pin\u00e1kini and its affluents upwards of 85 per cent. of the drainage is utilized. The largest tank is the R\u00e1ms\u00e1g\u00e1r, which is capable of irrigating 1500 acres.\nThe rocks are mostly syenite or granite, with a small admixture of mica and felspar. There is one range of a soft ferruginous clay-slate, which yields gold in small quantities; and of late years the subject of gold-mining in the District has attracted considerable attention. The total yield of the precious metal by washing from the alluvial soil was estimated in 1876 at about 4 lbs. per annum. A licence was granted to a European to 'prospect' the auriferous strata upon a scientific plan; a small European gold colony has established itself in Kol\u00e1r; and prospecting is being industriously carried on. Three hundred and seventy-three iron mines and quarries were worked in 1880. The estimated produce of the iron mines was 28,160 lbs. The soil in the valleys of Kol\u00e1r consists of a fertile loam, formed from the finer particles of the decomposed rocks washed down during the rains. On the higher levels, sand and gravel are found, and the cultivation is there confined to dry grains and pulses.\n\nThe hills are covered with scrub jungle and brushwood. The only tract where the trees attain any size is in the neighbourhood of Nandidr\u00fag, where an area of 7 square miles has been reserved by the Forest Department. In recent years, avenues of large trees have been planted along all the high roads, and the peasants are encouraged to plant groves of their own. The wild animals met with include bears, leopards, wild hog, and hyenas.\n\nHistory. \u2014 The early history of Kol\u00e1r is involved in the usual Hindu legends, chiefly localized at the village of Avani, which is identified with Av\u00e1ntika-kshetra, one of the ten sacred places of India, still a popular place of pilgrimage, and said formerly to have contained a linga set up by R\u00e1ma himself on his return to Ayodhya from the conquest of Lanka or Ceylon. Here, too, Sita, the wife of R\u00e1ma, is supposed to have given birth to her twin sons Kusa and Lava; and here Valmiki is represented as instructing them.\n\nThe earliest authentic evidence derived from inscriptions shows that this region in primitive times formed part of the kingdom of the Pallavas, who had Vengi as their capital. The Pallava kings were overthrown by Chol\u00e1 kings, to whom is attributed the foundation of Kol\u00e1r town. After the Chol\u00e1s came the Ball\u00e1la kings of the 12th century, who in their turn gave way to the powerful monarch of Vij\u00e1yanagar, in the early part of the 14th century.\n\nAbout this period arose the Gauda family, whose numerous branches, springing from the 'seven farmers of Kanchi,' gradually established themselves in various strong places throughout the modern Districts of Bangalore and Kol\u00e1r. Tinme Gauda, one of the 'seven farmers' from Bangalore, became a favourite at the Vij\u00e1yanagar court, and was permitted to establish himself in the old fort of Kol\u00e1r and to build Hoskote (the new fort). The Gauda chiefs appear to have\nmade no claim to independence, but to have submitted themselves successively to every conqueror who was strong enough to exercise temporary authority in those troubled times, until they were swept away by the organized empire of Haidar Ali.\n\nThe first Muhammadans to invade this tract were the Bijapur kings, whose general was the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Sh\u00e1hj\u00ed, father of Sivaj\u00ed. In 1639, Sh\u00e1hj\u00ed obtained Kol\u00e1r as a fief, which he transmitted to his son Venkoji, the founder of the Tanjore line. Subsequently Kol\u00e1r was overrun by the Mughals, and placed under the government of Fateh Muhammad, whose famous son, Haidar Al\u00ed, was born here at the little village of Budikot. In 1761, the District was formally ceded to Haidar Al\u00ed by the Niz\u00e1m; and after the fall of Tip\u00fa in 1799, it was incorporated in the Hindu State of Mysore. The chief historical interest of modern times centres round the hill fort of Nandidr\u00fag (Nundydroog), which was stormed by the British in 1791, under the eye of Lord Cornwallis, after a bombardment of twenty-one days.\n\nTwo towns have a local history, viz. Chikballapur and Gumn\u00e1yakanpalya. The former was founded about 1479 by one of the Gauda family, and rapidly grew into the capital of a petty kingdom, whose rock fortress was at Nandidr\u00fag. The p\u00e1leg\u00e1r of his time successfully resisted the conquering Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mysore in the beginning of the 18th century; but, like the rest of his compeers, he fell before the might of Haidar Al\u00ed, and his dominions were absorbed in Mysore. Gumn\u00e1yakanpalya was founded about one hundred years earlier, as the fortress of a p\u00e1leg\u00e1r, whose line also was extinguished by Haidar Al\u00ed.\n\nPopulation.\u2014A kh\u00e1nasum\u00e1ri or house enumeration of the people in 1853-54 returned a total of 461,979 persons. The regular Census of 1871 ascertained the number to be 618,954, showing an increase of nearly 34 per cent. in the interval of eighteen years, if the earlier estimate can be trusted. The Census taken on February 17, 1881, gives the following statistics:\u2014Total population, 461,129; males, 228,193, females, 232,936. Area, 1891 square miles; number of towns and villages, 2983; occupied houses, 77,633; unoccupied houses, 17,887; persons per square mile, 244; villages per square mile, 1'58; houses per square mile, 50'5; persons per occupied house, 5'94. In the t\u00e1luk of Sidlagh\u00e1ta, which is reckoned to be peculiarly healthy, is found the greatest density of population in Mysore, about 375 per square mile. There are, under 15 years of age, 76,367 boys and 79,715 girls; total children, 156,082, or over 33 per cent. of the population.\n\nThe male population is classified under six main groups\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every kind and the learned professions, 12,225; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 563; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 5836; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including\ngardeners, 127,151; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 13,046; and (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 69,372.\n\nThe religious division of the people shows\u2014Hindus, 439,092, or 95 per cent.; Muhammadans, 20,664, or 4 per cent.; Jains, 504; and Christians, 869. The Hindus are further sub-divided according to caste, as follows:\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 21,685, of whom the majority belong to the Smarta sect; Kshattriyas, 1121; Komatis, 7534, mostly traders; and Nagatars, traders, 2408. Of inferior castes, by far the most numerous is the Vakkaligars (115,926), who are agricultural labourers; next come the Bedars (35,567), hunters; the Banajigas (31,287), traders; the Kurubas (28,669), shepherds. The Lingayats, who have always been influential in this part of the country, number only 9823; out-castes are returned at 67,660, wandering tribes at 3973, and non-Hindu aboriginal tribes at 256. The Muhammadans, who muster thickest in the t\u00e1lukas of Kol\u00e1r and Sriniv\u00e1sapur, are chiefly returned as Deccani Musalm\u00e1ns. Classified by tribes, they are thus distributed:\u2014Sunn\u00eds, 20,071; Shi\u00e1s, 219; Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, 42; Pind\u00e1ris, 19; Labbais, 218; and \u2018others,\u2019 95. Out of the total of 869 Christians, 76 are Europeans and 44 Eurasians, leaving 749 for the native converts. According to another principle of division, there are 386 Protestants and 483 Roman Catholics. The language chiefly spoken in the District is K\u00e1narese.\n\nOf the 2983 towns and villages in Kol\u00e1r District, 2348 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 529 from two hundred to five hundred; 78 from five hundred to one thousand; 20 from one to two thousand; 3 from two to three thousand; 1 from three to five thousand; 3 from five to ten thousand; and 1 from ten to fifteen thousand. The following towns, which are also municipalities, each contain more than 5000 inhabitants:\u2014KOL\u00c1R, 11,172; CHIKBALLAPUR, 9133; SIDLAGHATA, 5804; CHINTAMANI, 5119. Apart from the towns already mentioned, the most interesting places in the District are\u2014Avani, one of the ten places of greatest sanctity in India, and alleged to have been the residence of Valmiki, author of the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana; Avati, the original settlement of the \u2018seven Kanchi farmers;\u2019 Budikot, the birthplace of Haidar Al\u00ed; and the hill fort of Nandidr\u00fag, with the sacred village of Nandi at its base. Both fort and town were captured by Lord Cornwallis in 1791.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014More than 45 per cent. of the people of the District (210,197) are directly engaged in agriculture. The agricultural products are substantially the same as those of the neighbouring District of Bangalore, except that the abundance of tanks encourages more attention to wet crops and vegetables. The staple food of the people consists of r\u00e1gi (Eleusine corocana) and jo\u00e1r (Sorghum vulgare),\nboth of which come under the category of 'dry crops.' Rice, also, is largely grown in the lower valleys, and nearly half the annual produce is exported. It is estimated that in ordinary years the surplus of the food crops, to the value of about \u00a350,000, is exported to Bangalore and the adjoining Districts of Madras. Besides various pulses and oil-seeds, the miscellaneous crops include sugar-cane, poppy, tobacco, and mulberry for silkworms. Among vegetables are turmeric, garlic, chilli, and potatoes. The cultivation, also, of viled\u00e9le or betel-leaf, tamarind, and kadale k\u00e1yi or ground nut, is very considerable.\n\nThe following are the agricultural statistics for 1880\u201381:\u2014Total area under actual cultivation, 519 square miles; cultivable but not under cultivation, 342 square miles; uncultivable waste, 1030 square miles. Area under rice, 39,300 acres; wheat, 90; other food-grains, 260,244; oil-seeds, 12,500; sugar-cane, 7040; vegetables, 11,000; mulberry, 692; tobacco, 606; cocoa-nut and areca-nut, 739; fibres, 90; coffee, 45 acres. The current (1880) rents per acre in the District are as follows:\u2014For rice land, 12s.; for wheat, 12s.; inferior grains, 3s.; cotton, 3s.; oil-seeds, 3s.; sugar-cane, \u00a31, 4s.; tobacco, 12s. The out-turn of the land per acre was, in 1880, as follows:\u2014Rice, 720 lbs.; wheat, 817 lbs.; inferior food-grains, 990 lbs.; oil-seeds, 598 lbs.; sugar-cane, 1420 lbs.; and tobacco, 438 lbs. The average assessment per acre of cultivated land is 4s. 8d.\n\nThe very large number of tanks forming chains along all the river valleys has already been alluded to as an element in the scenery of the District. The total is 5497, themselves covering an area of upwards of 120,000 acres. As many as 400 can be counted from the summit of Nandidr\u00fag. In addition to these tanks, irrigation is also practised from small channels branching off from ancient anicuts or dams in the rivers. Manure is largely used for sugar-cane, which flourishes best in the Mulb\u00e1gal t\u00e1luk.\n\nThe indigenous cattle of the District are of a diminutive breed, but fine bulls are imported from the Madras frontier. Several large cattle fairs are held annually, of which the most frequented is at the village of V\u00e1nar\u00e1s\u0131, where 60,000 bullocks sometimes change hands within the nine days during which the fair lasts. The fairs at Avani and Nandi are of scarcely second importance. In connection with these fairs, cattle shows with prizes have been instituted by Government, and the breeding of cattle has become a passion with well-to-do peasants. Buffaloes are commonly used for ploughing throughout the District. Sheep and goats are numerous, and the village of Gumn\u00e1yakanp\u00e1lya is noted for a superior breed of the former animals. The wool, however, is of a coarse kind, only suited for native blankets. In 1880\u201381 the agricultural stock was as follows:\u2014Horned cattle, 192,085; horses and ponies, 2442; asses, 7837; sheep and goats, 241,041; pigs, 1905; carts, 19,384; ploughs, 58,797.\nThe town of Kol\u00e1r and the surrounding villages are celebrated for turkeys, which are exported in large numbers to the markets of Bangalore, Bellary, etc.\n\nThe prices of produce in 1880 were, per maund of 80 lbs., as follows:\u2014\nRice, 4s. 7d.; wheat, 9s. 7d.; cotton, \u00a32, 13s. 4d.; sugar, \u00a31, 17s. 7d.;\nsalt, 7s. 1d.; gram, 7s. 10\u00bdd.; r\u0101gi, 2s. 2d.; tobacco, \u00a33, 7s. 3d.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The staple industry of the District arises out of the extensive cultivation of sugar-cane, and consists of the manufacture of refined sugar, jaggery, and molasses. The production of raw silk, a business confined to the Muhammadan class of the community, has greatly declined in recent years, owing to the continued mortality among the silkworms. The weaving of coarse cotton cloth and rough woollen blankets or kamblis is common throughout the District, as also are the making of common pottery and the pressing of oil. The returns show a total of 6960 looms and 379 oil-mills. In the mountainous taluk of Gumn\u00e1yakanp\u00e1lya, iron-ore was once worked by native methods in considerable quantities, but the industry has died out since the famine.\n\nThe trade of the District is conducted at weekly markets and at large annual fairs. There are 7 market towns, where the average weekly attendance numbers over 1000. The principal fairs are those held at Nandi, attended by 50,000 persons; Avani, 40,000; V\u00e1nar\u00e1s\u00ed, 25,000; which are all important cattle fairs, besides having a religious character. It has not been observed that these large gatherings result in the propagation of any epidemic disease. Among exports from the District sugar holds the first place; the annual production is estimated at \u00a378,060 worth of jaggery and refined sugar. Raw silk is manufactured to the value of \u00a3800; cotton, wool, and other fibres to the value of \u00a312,972; oils to the value of \u00a35176. Vegetables, betel-leaf, cotton cloth, and gh\u00ed are also produced in sufficient quantities to leave a surplus for other Districts. Almost the sole import received in return is European piece-goods, valued, but manifestly over-valued, at \u00a31,466,000. The imports of salt are returned at \u00a35700. The Bangalore branch of the south-west line of the Madras Railway runs for 31 miles across the south of the District, with stations at Kamasa-mudram, Bowringpet or Kol\u00e1r Road, Taiakaland Mal\u00far. The length of made roads in 1880\u201381 was 419 miles.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1880\u201381, the total revenue of Kol\u00e1r District, including forests, education, and public works, amounted to \u00a396,941. The chief item was land revenue, \u00a385,763. The District is subdivided into 10 taluks or fiscal divisions, with 81 hoblis or minor fiscal units. In 1870\u201371, the number of separate estates was 678, owned by 78,247 registered proprietors or coparceners.\n\nDuring the year 1880\u201381, the average daily prison population of the District jail was 55, and of the taluk lock-ups 2\u2014total, 57, of whom\nwere women, showing 1 person in jail to every 8089 of the population. Cost of District jail in 1880, \u00a3389; net cost per head of convicts, \u00a36, 19s. 7d. In the same year, the District police force numbered 475 of all ranks, and the municipal police 3 officers and 15 men\u2014total, 493 men of all ranks, maintained at an aggregate cost of \u00a35624. These figures show 1 policeman to about 4 square miles of area, or to every 935 of the population, the cost being nearly 3d. per head of population. The number of schools aided and inspected by Government in 1874 was 233, attended by 5547 pupils, being 1 school to every 11\u00b706 square miles and 8\u00b79 pupils to every 1000 of the population. In addition there were 102 unaided schools, with 1494 pupils. In 1880\u201381, Government and aided schools numbered 155 for boys, with 4575 pupils, and 7 for girls, with 162 pupils. The London Missionary Society has a station at Chikballapur.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Kol\u00e1r closely resembles that of Bangalore, and shares in its general reputation for healthiness. The mean annual temperature is about 76\u00b0 F. During the year 1880\u201381, the maximum recorded was 91\u00b0 in the month of May, the minimum 65\u00b0 in December. The average rainfall for the year is 30 inches, which chiefly falls during the months of September and October. In former times, Kol\u00e1r town was periodically attacked by cholera and other epidemics, introduced by the crowds of pilgrims that annually passed through. But attention to sanitary precautions on the part of the municipal authorities, and the construction of the railway, have effectually checked this evil. A total of 7496 deaths, or 12\u00b77 per thousand, were registered in 1880; but the actual mortality is no doubt much higher. In 1880, 25 people were killed by snake-bite. In the same year, 13,557 persons were vaccinated. There are 2 civil dispensaries in the District\u2014at Kol\u00e1r and Chikballapur\u2014each affording relief to about 75 patients per day. During the year 1880, the dispensary at Kol\u00e1r town was attended by 160 in-patients and 7,329 out-patients. [For further information regarding Kol\u00e1r, see the Mysore and Coorg Gazetteer, by Mr. Lewis Rice, vol. ii. pp. 82\u2013138 (Bangalore, 1876); and also the Census Report of Mysore for 1881.]\n\nKol\u00e1r.\u2014T\u00e1luk in Kol\u00e1r District, Mysore State. Area, 337 square miles. Population (1871) 71,493; (1881) 56,971, namely, 27,526 males and 29,445 females. Hindus number 52,248; Muhammadans, 4364; and Christians, 359. The P\u00e1l\u00e1r river runs through the northern and eastern parts of Kol\u00e1r t\u00e1luk; the western side is occupied with the ranges of the Kol\u00e1r and Vakkaleri hills. Well cultivated, including even the table-land on the Kol\u00e1r hills. The old Bangalore-Madras road passes through Kol\u00e1r. The t\u00e1luk contains 1 criminal court and 8 police stations. Regular police, 78 men; village watch (chaukid\u00e1rs), 148. Revenue (1883\u201384), \u00a312,856.\nKol\u00e1r.\u2014Chief town of Kol\u00e1r District, Mysore State; situated in lat. 13\u00b0 8' 5\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 10' 18\" E.; 43 miles east-north-east of Bangalore by road, but also connected with it by rail from the Kol\u00e1r Road station at Bowringpet, 10 miles to the south. Population (1871) 9924; (1881) 11,172, namely, 5356 males and 5816 females. Hindus, 8165; Muhammadans, 2724; and Christians, 283. The town contains the usual District offices, school, dispensary, barracks, jail, etc. The chief building is the tomb of Fateh Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, the father of Haidar Al\u00ed (see Kolar District). The mulberry is cultivated for the rearing of silkworms. Turkeys are exported in large numbers to Bangalore, Bellary, and other places. Manufacture of kambl\u00eds or coarse blankets. Weekly fair.\n\nKol\u00e1r (Colair; Kolleru; Klugu; Kolair; Koller).\u2014Lake in Kistna and God\u00e1vari Districts, Madras Presidency. Lat. 16\u00b0 30' to 16\u00b0 45' N., long. 81\u00b0 5' to 81\u00b0 27' E. A curious stretch of fresh water, half lake, half swamp, sometimes covering more than 100 square miles in the monsoon. In the dry weather the area is much reduced, and many parts are merely mud. A few small streams feed it, and the Upputeru river is its only outlet. At no time is it very deep. It abounds in waterfowl, and is fairly stocked with fish. Lake Kol\u00e1r contains numerous fertile islets called lank\u00e1s, many of which are inhabited and highly cultivated. On the other hand, many of the smaller ones are submerged during floods. The origin of the unusual depression which forms the bed of the lake is unknown, but it was possibly the result of an earthquake. In very dry seasons the ruins of ancient villages are perceptible in the bed, and large quantities of charcoal and charred beams give support to the local tradition that this was the scene of a conflagration, which was extinguished by a great flood; the latter caused by volcanic subsidence.\n\nAnother hypothesis, common to the Kol\u00e1r, and to the Chilk\u00e1 lake in Orissa, explains these sheets of fresh water as caused by the land-making activity of the great rivers, acting together with the monsoon, which blows up an intervening beach or bank of sand between any low-lying unfilled tract and the sea. The inner low-lying tract receives the surrounding drainage, and becomes a shallow lake. The God\u00e1vari and the Kistna have pushed out their deltas on either side, leaving the area of the lake still to be filled up. Its dimensions are still being gradually reduced by reclamation and embankments.\n\nTwo inscribed copper-plates of the early Pallava dynasty have been found in the Kol\u00e1r lake. A legend runs that one of the Orissa kings had a fort at Kolleti Kota on one of the eastern islands of the lake, and that the enemy, probably Muhammadan, encamped at Chiguru Kota on the shores of the lake, whose waters prevented an attack on Kolleti Kota. At last a channel, the Upputeru, was excavated, and the lake waters drawn off into the sea. To ensure the success of\nthe assault that followed, the Orissa general is said to have sacrificed his daughter. And her name, Perantala Kanama, commemorates the point of attack to the present day.\n\n**Kole.**\u2014Town in the Kar\u00e1d Sub-division of Sat\u00e1ra District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 17\u00b0 14' N., long. 74\u00b0 10' E.; 31 miles south by east of Sat\u00e1ra town. Population (1872) 5137; (1881) 1781.\n\n**Kolh\u00e1n.**\u2014Tract of country forming a Government estate in Singbh\u00fam District, Bengal. Area, 1905 square miles, with 883 villages, 31,640 houses, and a population (1872) of 150,904 persons; density of population, 79 persons per square mile; persons per village, 171; persons per house, 4.8. No separate Census of the Kolh\u00e1n tract appears to have been taken in 1881.\n\nThe indigenous village system of the Kols, based upon a federal union of villages under a single divisional head-man, which is gradually dying out elsewhere in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, still survives in this tract. A group of from 5 to 20 villages forms a *pirhi* or *pir*, each of which has its own *mund\u00e1* or village head, all of whom are subject to the authority of the *m\u00e1nk\u00ed* or divisional head-man, who exercises the functions of divisional collector of rents and of divisional police superintendent within the limits of his *pir*. Every *mund\u00e1* or village head is responsible for the payment of the revenue, and for the detection and arrest of criminals in his own village, to the *m\u00e1nk\u00ed* or divisional head of the *pir*; and this latter official is in his turn responsible to Government. For acting as revenue collectors, the *m\u00e1nk\u00eds* receive a commission of one-tenth, and the *mund\u00e1s* one-sixth, of the rent which passes through their hands. Besides these duties, the *m\u00e1nk\u00eds* and *mund\u00e1s*, each in his degree, have certain informal powers to decide village disputes and questions of tribal usage.\n\n**Kolh\u00e1pur** (or Karav\u00edra; Karv\u00edr).\u2014Native State under the Kolh\u00e1pur and Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Political Agency, Bombay Presidency. Kolh\u00e1pur State is situated between 15\u00b0 58' and 17\u00b0 11' N. lat., and between 73\u00b0 45' and 74\u00b0 24' E. long. It is bounded on the north by the river Warna, which separates it from the British District of Sat\u00e1ra; on the north-east by the river Kistna (Krishna), separating it from S\u00e1ngli, Mir\u00e1j, and Kurundw\u00e1d; on the east and south by the District of Belg\u00e1um; and on the west by the Sahy\u00e1dri mountains, which divide it from S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri on the south-west and Ratn\u00e1giri on the west. Kolh\u00e1pur State comprises portions of the old Hindu divisions of Mah\u00e1-r\u00e1shtra and Karn\u00e1tak,\u2014a distinction which is still marked in the language of the people, part of whom speak Mar\u00e1thi, and the remainder K\u00e1narese. It forms one of the Deccan group of Native States. Area, 2816 square miles; population (1881) 800,189 persons. Chief town and capital, Kolh\u00e1pur.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Stretching from the heart of the Sahy\u00e1dri range\neastwards into the plain of the Deccan, Kolhapur includes tracts of country of widely different character and appearance. In the west, along the spurs of the main chain of the Sahyadri mountains, are situated wild and picturesque hill slopes and valleys, producing little but timber, and till lately covered with rich forests. The central belt, which is open and fertile in parts, is crossed by several lines of low hills running east and west at right angles to the main range. Farther east, the land becomes more open, and presents the unpicturesque uniformity of a well-cultivated and treeless plain, broken only by an occasional river. Among the western hills are perched the forts of Panhala, Vishalgarh, Bavra, Bhudargarh, and Rangna, ancient strongholds of the Kolhapur chieftains. The State is watered by eight streams of considerable size; but though navigable during the rainy months by trading boats of 2 tons, none are so large that they cannot be forded in the hot season. The only lake of any importance is that of Rankala, near the town of Kolhapur. It has lately been improved at a considerable cost. Its circumference is about 3 miles, and its mean depth 33 feet.\n\nThe principal agricultural products of the State are rice, millet, sugar-cane, tobacco, cotton, safflower, and vegetables. Iron-ore of three varieties is found in the Kolhapur territory. It is most plentiful in Vishalgarh, Panhala, Bhudargarh, and Kolhapur proper, near the main range of the Sahyadri Hills. In these places it is generally found near the surface, in laterite stone. Formerly the smelting of iron was an industry of some importance; but, owing to the cost of manual labour, the increased price of fuel, and the low rate of freights from England, the Kolhapur mineral cannot compete with that imported from Europe. Stone is the only other mineral product of the State. There are several good quarries, especially one in a place known as Jotibas Hill, with a fine grained basalt, that takes a polish like marble. Game abounds, and the rivers yield large quantities of fish.\n\nHistory.\u2014The members of the third branch of the Silahara family, which was settled above the Western Ghats, possessed the territory lying round Kolhapur and in the north-west part of Belgauum District, from about the end of the 10th to early in the 13th century A.D. In 1213-14, the country passed to the Devgiri Yadava dynasty. The ancient Hindu dynasty was subverted by the Bahmani kings of the Deccan, and the country afterwards passed under the rule of Bijapur. Sivaji obtained possession of the forts in 1659, which, though taken and retaken many times, finally remained with the Marathas on the death of Aurangzeb.\n\nThe present Rajas of Kolhapur trace their descent from Rajaraj Ram, a younger son of Sivaji the Great, the founder of the Maratha power. After the death of Rajaraj Ram in 1700, his widow placed her\nson Sivaji in power at Kolhapur. But in 1707, when Sh\u00e1hu, the son of Sambh\u00e1j\u00ed, Sivaji's elder son, was released from captivity, he claimed the sovereignty over all the possessions of his grandfather, and fixed his capital at Satara. Between the two branches of the family disputes continued for several years, till in 1731 a treaty was concluded, under the terms of which the Kolhapur family agreed to yield precedence to Sh\u00e1hu, and Sh\u00e1hu recognised Kolhapur as an independent principality.\n\nOn the death of R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1m's sons in 1760, the direct line of Sivaji became extinct; and a member of the family of the Bhonslas was adopted under the name of Sivaji II. The prevalence of piracy from the Kolhapur port of M\u00e1lw\u00e1n compelled the Bombay Government to send expeditions against Kolhapur in 1765, and again in 1792, when the R\u00e1j\u00e1 agreed to give compensation for the losses which British merchants had sustained since 1785, and to permit the establishment of factories at M\u00e1lw\u00e1n and Kolhapur. Internal dissensions and wars with the neighbouring States of Patwardh\u00e1ns, S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri, and Nip\u00e1ni gradually weakened the power of Kolhapur. In 1811, a treaty was concluded with the British Government, by which, in return for the cession of certain forts, the Kolhapur chief was guaranteed against the attacks of foreign powers; while on his part he engaged to abstain from hostilities with other States, and to refer all disputes to the arbitration of the British Government.\n\nDuring the war with the Peshw\u00e1 in 1817, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kolhapur sided with the British. In reward, the tracts of Chikori and Manoli, formerly wrested from him by the chief of Nip\u00e1ni, were restored to him. But these tracts did not remain long in the possession of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kolhapur; they were taken back from him by the British Government in 1829, as the then R\u00e1j\u00e1 did not act in accordance with the treaty entered into by him. Sh\u00e1h\u00e1j\u00ed, alias B\u00e1wa S\u00e1hib, who came to the throne in 1822, proved a quarrelsome and profligate ruler; and in consequence of his aggressions between 1822 and 1829, the British were three times obliged to move a force against him. On his death in 1838, a council of regency was formed to govern during the minority of Sivaji III. Quarrels arose among the members of this council, and the consequent anarchy led to the appointment by the British Government of a minister of its own. The efforts, however, which he made to reform the administration gave rise to a general rebellion, which extended to the neighbouring State of S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri. After the suppression of this rising, all the forts were dismantled, and the system of hereditary garrisons was abolished. The military force of the State was disbanded, and replaced by a local corps.\n\nIn 1862, a treaty was concluded with Sivaji III., who was bound\nin all matters of importance to be guided by the advice of the British Government. In 1866, on his death-bed, Sivaji was allowed to adopt a successor in his sister's son, R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1m. In 1870, R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1m proceeded on a tour in Europe, and, while on his return journey to India, died at Florence on the 30th November 1870.\n\nSivaj\u00ed Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 Chhatrapati iv. succeeded R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1m by adoption. He was invested with the Knighthood of the Order of the Star of India. In 1882 he became insane, and Government was compelled to appoint a Council of Regency, headed by the chief of K\u00e1g\u00e1l as Regent. Sivaji iv. died on the 25th December 1883; and having no issue, was succeeded by adoption by Yeshwant Rao, alias B\u00e1ba S\u00e1hib, under the name of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1j\u00ed. He is the eldest son of the Regent, and a lad of about nine years of age.\n\nThe R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kolh\u00e1pur holds a patent authorizing adoption, and the succession follows the rule of primogeniture. He is entitled to a salute of 19 guns, and is empowered to try his own subjects for capital offences, without permission from the Political Agent.\n\nPopulation.\u2014In 1872, the population of the State was returned at 804,103. According to the Census of 1881, it amounted to 800,189. There has thus been a decrease of 3914 in nine years. In 1881 the males numbered 410,647, females 389,542. The people are scattered through 5 towns and 1056 villages, and occupy 129,148 houses; unoccupied houses number 16,036. The density of population is 284 persons per square mile; towns and villages per square mile, '376; houses per square mile, 51'5; persons per house, 6.\n\nOf the 1061 towns and villages in the State, 184 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 382 between two and five hundred; 306 between five hundred and one thousand; 123 between one and two thousand; 34 between two and three thousand; 27 between three and five thousand; 4 between five and ten thousand; and 1 between twenty and fifty thousand. The five towns in Kolh\u00e1pur State with a population above 5000 are\u2014Karvir (38,599); Inchalkaranji (9107); Shirol (6944); Kagal (6371); and Gadh Hinglaj (5002).\n\nThe male population is thus distributed as regards occupation\u2014(1) Professional class, including officials and the learned professions, 18,884; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 4184; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 3748; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including shepherds, 289,253; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 37,182; and (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 57,396.\n\nClassified according to religion, there are\u2014Hindus, 719,164, or more than 89 per cent. of the whole population; Muhammadans, 33,022; Christians, 1253; Jains, 46,732; Parsi, 1; Buddhists, 12; and\nJews, 5. Among Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans number 29,446; R\u00e1jputs, 1500; Berads, 5277; Dhangars, 38,326; Kumbh\u00e1rs (potters), 8509; Ling\u00e1yats (mostly traders), 72,391; Mahars (inferior caste), 65,314; Cham\u00e1rs, 10,219; Kunb\u00eds, 362,158; Mangs, 13,323; S\u00fat\u00e1s, 11,451; Kosht\u00ed, 5924; N\u00e1pits, 7476; Darj\u00eds, 5666; Dhob\u00eds, 5208. The Muhammadans are thus sub-divided\u2014Shaikhs, 25,984; Sayyids, 4104; Path\u00e1ns, 2186; and unspecified, 748.\n\nTrade, etc.\u2014The principal manufactures are pottery, hardware, coarse cotton, woollen cloth, felt, paper, liquor, perfumes, and lac and glass ornaments. Coarse sugar, tobacco, cotton, and grain are the chief exports; and sugar, spices, cocoa-nuts, piece-goods, silk, salt, and sulphur are the principal imports. The most noteworthy centres of local trade with permanent markets are Kolh\u00e1pur town, Shirol, Wadg\u00e1on, Alta, Inchalkaranj\u00ed, K\u00e1g\u00e1l, and Malk\u00e1pur. Six principal lines of road pass through Kolh\u00e1pur territory, the most important being that from Poona to Belg\u00e1um, which crosses the State from north to south.\n\nRevenue, Administration, etc.\u2014There are thirteen more or less important estates, including the four feudatories of the Kolh\u00e1pur R\u00e1j, viz. Vishalgarh, B\u00e1vra, K\u00e1g\u00e1l, Inchalkaranj\u00ed, Jagatguru, Guru Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j, Torgal, Kapsi, D\u00e1tt\u00e1ji R\u00e1o, Datwad, Himat Bah\u00e1dur, Sir Lashkar, and Patankar; their chiefs pay a nazar or tribute to Kolh\u00e1pur on succession, and also usually an annual contribution. Accounts of them will be found under their respective names; the principal are VISHALGARH, BAVRA, KAGAL, and INCHALKARANJI. The gross annual revenue of Kolh\u00e1pur State in 1882-83 was \u00a3221,976. The actual income of the chief is given at \u00a3167,400. He maintains a military force of 1684 men. Exclusive of a few missionary institutions, there are (1882) in all 174 schools. There is also a Provincial College, which was organized in 1880. The total number of pupils on the rolls is returned at 10,419. There is a native library, a local newspaper, and 11 reading rooms established in the State. The cost of education in 1882-83 was \u00a38100. Seven petty chiefs attend the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r class of the R\u00e1j\u00e1r\u00e1m College. The Forest Department cleared a profit of \u00a31765 in 1882. There are municipalities at Kolh\u00e1pur, Narsob\u00e1chi V\u00e1di, Inchalkaranji, and K\u00e1g\u00e1l. Strength of police, 646 men, maintained at a cost of \u00a36637. In 1882-83, 3806 persons were brought before the 38 magisterial courts of the State. The central jail at Kolh\u00e1pur has an average daily population of 164; cost per prisoner, \u00a39, 12s. There are 13 subordinate jails. The telegraph and postal systems are maintained by the British Government.\n\nClimate and Medical Aspects.\u2014At an elevation of about 1800 feet above the sea, Kolh\u00e1pur enjoys on the whole a temperate climate. In the west, with its heavy rainfall and timber-covered hills and valleys,\nthe air keeps cool throughout the year; but in the plain dry tracts beyond the hills, suffocating easterly winds prevail from April to June. During the hot weather months, the hill forts, rising about 1000 feet above the plain, afford a pleasant retreat. The ordinary forms of sickness are fevers, diarrhoea, cholera, dysentery, and small-pox. A State medical service has been organized. In 1882, the registered death-rate was 23 per 1000, and the birth-rate 33 per 1000.\n\n**Kolhapur** (or *Koll\u00e1pura*, *Karav\u00edra*, or *Karv\u00edr*).\u2014Capital of Kolhapur State, Bombay Presidency, and residence of the chief; situated in lat. 16\u00b0 42' N., and long. 74\u00b0 16' E., opposite a gap in the Sahy\u00e1di Hills; 144 miles south by east from Poona, and 76 from Sat\u00e1ra. Population (1872) 37,663; (1881) 38,599, namely, 19,335 males and 19,264 females. Hindus numbered 33,583; Muhammadans, 3734; Jains, 1107; Christians, 164; Parsi, 1; and 'others,' 10.\n\nA picturesque native capital, thronged by traders from many parts, each in his national habit. Much has recently been done to improve the sanitation of the town, and to adorn it with handsome edifices. Some of the new public buildings of Kolhapur challenge comparison with the most successful efforts of modern Indian architecture. The income of the municipality in 1882-83 was \u00a34579.\n\nKolhapur has long been held in high esteem for the antiquity of its sacred shrines; and all current legends state that the present capital originally existed as a purely religious settlement, of which the great temple dedicated to the goddess Mah\u00e1lakshmi remains to mark the site. The cloisters, which formerly surrounded this great temple, now lie buried many feet under the surface of the earth, which appears to have undergone at no distant period a serious convulsion. The extreme antiquity of Kolhapur is borne out by the numerous Buddhist remains that have been discovered in the immediate neighbourhood, and notably by a crystal relic casket found in a large stupa, about 1880, bearing on its lid an inscription in Asoka characters of the 3rd century B.C. Small temples are frequently brought to light by excavations. It is believed that Karavira is the older and more important capital of the State, and that the transfer of the political capital, from Karavira to the originally religious settlement of Kolhapur, was probably necessitated by some convulsion of nature of which there are so many evidences in the neighbourhood of Kolhapur. The ancient Karavira is now a petty village on the north side of the present town of Kolhapur.\n\n**Kolikodu.**\u2014Town in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Calicut.\n\n**Kolkai** (or *Kork\u00e1i*).\u2014Village in Tenkar\u00e1i taluk, Tinneveli District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 8\u00b0 40' N., long. 78\u00b0 6' E. Population (1881) 2386. Number of houses, 677. Hindus numbered 2125;\nChristians, 250; and Muhammadans, 11. Now an inland town, but once a seaport at the mouth of the Tambraparni river, and the earliest seat of South Indian civilisation, where (according to tradition) the brothers Chera, Chola, and Pandya dwelt together before founding the three kingdoms that bore their respective names. \u039a\u03cc\u03bb\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9 \u1f10\u03bc\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd is mentioned by Ptolemy; and in the Periplus as the seat of King Pandya's pearl-fishery. It is referred to in the Peutinger Tables as 'Colcis Indorum,' and gave its name to the Colchic Gulf, now known as Manaar. The silt of the Tambraparni river has spread seaward, so that this once celebrated port is at present 5 miles from the coast. K\u00e1yal (Kail, Koil), where Marco Polo stopped for a time, succeeded Kolkai as the port of Mad\u00fara; but it also has been left 2 miles inland by the sea, and the insignificant village of Palayak\u00e1yal has been identified as the site of this once important city and seaport. The present K\u00e1yalpatam (q.v.) succeeded K\u00e1yal as the port of Mad\u00fara.\n\n**Kolladam.**\u2014The northern mouth of the K\u00e1ver\u00ed (Cauvery) river, Madras Presidency.\u2014See COLEROON.\n\n**Kollamallai.**\u2014Mountain range in Salem District, Madras Presidency; lying in the At\u00far and N\u00e1makal t\u00e1lukas.

General elevation from 2500 to 3500 feet; highest point in the range, 4663 feet above sea-level. The population includes a number of Malay\u00e1lis, or hillmen of the same race as those described in the article on the SHEVAROY HILLS. The Kot\u00e1s, a tribe characteristic of the Nilgiris, have a tradition that the Kollamallai Hills are the cradle of the race. The Kollamallais are cultivated in many parts, and furnish the surrounding country with forest produce\u2014sandal-wood, black-wood, and other valuable timbers, firewood, and charcoal. They bear an evil reputation at certain seasons for malarious fever of a deadly type.\n\n**Koll\u00e9r** (or Kolleru).\u2014Lake in Kistna and God\u00e1vari Districts, Madras Presidency.\u2014See KOLAR.\n\n**Koll\u00far.**\u2014Gh\u00e1t or pass in South K\u00e1nara District, Madras Presidency.

Lat. 16\u00b0 37' 59\" N., long. 80\u00b0 34' 17\" E. Population (1871) 5207; (1881) 4289. Number of houses, 973. Hindus numbered 3391, and Muhammadans 8081. Now unimportant, but formerly a fortress of some strength, giving its name to a Province known to the Musalm\u00e1ns as Must\u00e1fanagar or Must\u00e1s\u00e1b\u00e1d. It was in fact the capital of one of the 5 Northern Circars, and was a frequently contested point for two and a half centuries. The hill fort was constructed, circ. 1360, by the Reddis of Kondavir. It was taken by the B\u00e1hmani king, Muhammad Sh\u00e1h II., in 1471, from the Orissa R\u00e1j\u00e1s, and in 1477 from a revolted garrison. Falling again into the hands of the Orissa R\u00e1j\u00e1s, it was taken by Krishna R\u00e1ya circ. 1515, and by Sult\u00e1n Kuli Kutab Sh\u00e1h in 1521. It surrendered to the troops of the Emperor Aurangzeb in 1687, and on March 10, 1766, was taken by assault, by General Caillaud, from the Niz\u00e1m. The old enclosure of the walled city is now chiefly occupied by corn-fields, but the ruins of the citadel remain on the overhanging hill. A small British garrison was stationed here till January 1859. The barracks have been converted into a public bungalow. At Kondapall\u00ed there is a special local industry, the manufacture of small figures and toys from a very light wood (Gyrocarpus Jacquinii), which grows on the hills in its neighbourhood.\n\nKondavir (Condaveed; Kondav\u00eddu; Kondhir; Kondaver\u2014Hamilton).\u2014Town and fort in Narsaraopet t\u00e1luk, Kistna District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 16\u00b0 15' 15\" N., long. 80\u00b0 17' 25\" E. Population (1881) 1746. Number of houses, 418. Hindus numbered 1533; Muhammadans, 124; and Christians, 4.\n\nOnce the capital of a Province of the same name, extending from the Kistna to the Gundlakamma (Orme). Constructed in the 12th century by the Orissa R\u00e1j\u00e1s, the hill fortress above the town of Kondavir, on a ridge running in a north-east and south-west direction for 9\u00bd miles, was the seat of the Redd\u00ed dynasty (1328\u20131428), was taken by Krishna R\u00e1ya about 1516, and by Sult\u00e1n Kuli Kutab Sh\u00e1h of Golconda in 1531, 1536, and 1579. It was termed Murtizanagar by the Muhammadans.\nThe French obtained the Province in 1752, and in 1757 starved out a garrison of local insurgents. Kondavir was made over to the English Company in 1788.\n\nThe highest point of the hill is 1701 feet above sea-level. The village situated at the western foot of the central ridge, 5 furlongs north-east of the fort. The old town of Kondavir was to the east of the village, in the triangular valley between the ridges. The fort, 1050 feet (described by Mr. Boswell in the *Indian Antiquary*, vol. i. p. 182), is of large extent even now, and many parts of it, including granaries, palace, etc., are in good repair. There are one or two European bungalows here, and the place was for a time used as a sanitarium by the officers of Guntur. The only industry worth notice is the extraction of essences and fragrant oils from jasmine and other plants, which are sent to Haidarabad for sale.\n\n**Kondayapollam.**\u2014Town in Udayagiri *tiluk*, Nellore District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 3885; houses, 930.

Area, 174 square miles; number of villages, 109; number of houses, 9669. Total population (1881) 32,979, namely, males 16,267, and females 16,712; average density of population, 189.5 persons per square mile. The area in the plains, which is fertile and well cultivated, comprises 101 villages; the largest of which contains 400 huts or houses, with over 1000 inhabitants. Chief products, wheat, gram, cotton, etc. The chief resides in a substantial stone building, standing in a fortified square. He is a Bairagi, but belongs to a sect among which marriage is permitted. He pays to the British Government a yearly tribute of \u00a31100. His estimated annual income is \u00a32203.\n\n**Kongnoli.**\u2014Town in the Chikori Sub-division of Belg\u00e1um District, Bombay Presidency. Situated in lat. 16\u00b0 32' 30\" N., and long. 74\u00b0 24' E., 4 miles north of Sadalgi, and 22 miles north-west of Chikori on the Belg\u00e1um-Kolhapur road, in the extreme north-west corner of Belg\u00e1um District. The town has a large trade, sending rice to Belg\u00e1um and various places in Kolhapur, and importing cloth, date, salt, spices, and sugar, through the ports of R\u00e1j\u00e1pur and Vengurla in Ratn\u00e1giri District. Weekly market on Thursday, when cotton, yarn, grain, molasses, tobacco, and from 2000 to 3000 cattle form the chief articles of trade. Weaving of women's robes, waistcloths, and inferior blankets are the only industries. Travellers' bungalow, rest-house, post-office, and two Government schools, one for boys and the other for girls. Paper for packing purposes and for envelopes was manufactured to a large extent before the famine of 1876\u201377, but during the famine the paper-makers deserted the town. Population (1872) 5143; (1881) 5061.\nKonkair.\u2014Town in N\u00e1gpur District, Central Provinces. \u2014 See KAKAIR.\n\nKonkan.\u2014A name applied to the Mar\u00e1th\u00ed-speaking lowland strip along the southern portion of the Bombay Presidency, situated between the Western Gh\u00e1ts and the sea. The term has no very distinct administrative signification, and its former geographical limits have become less strictly defined than of old. The coast strip, to which the word is now applied, is a fertile and generally level tract, varying from 1 or 2 to about 50 miles in breadth between the sea and the mountains, with an area of about 12,500 square miles, and, approximately, a population of 3,800,000. It is watered by hill streams, and at parts intersected by tidal backwaters, but has nowhere any great rivers. A luxuriant vegetation of palms rises along the coast, the cocoa-nut plantations forming an important source of wealth to the villagers. Splendid forests cover the Gh\u00e1ts on its eastern boundary. The crops are abundant; and owing to the monsoon rainfall being precipitated upon the Gh\u00e1ts behind, the Konkan is peculiarly exempt from drought and famine. The common language of the Konkan is Mar\u00e1th\u00ed. K\u00e1narese is spoken in the southern part, and a little Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed in the north of Th\u00e1na.\n\nIn a geographical sense, the Konkan forms one of the five territorial Divisions of the Bombay Presidency, the others being the Deccan, the Karn\u00e1tik, Gujar\u00e1t, and Sind. It includes the town and island of Bombay, the three British Districts of Ratn\u00e1giri, Kol\u00e1ba, and Th\u00e1na, the three Native States of Jawh\u00e1r, Janjira, and S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri, and the Portuguese territory of Goa, all of which see separately.\n\n| Area in Square Miles | Population (Census of 1881) |\n|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| Ratn\u00e1giri District   | 3,922                     | 997,090                   |\n| Kol\u00e1ba               | 1,496                     | 381,649                   |\n| Th\u00e1na                | 4,243                     | 908,548                   |\n| Bombay City and Island | 22                        | 773,196                   |\n| Jawh\u00e1r State         | 534                       | 48,556                    |\n| Janjira              | 325                       | 76,361                    |\n| S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri           | 900                       | 174,433                   |\n| Goa Territory        | 1,062                     | 445,449                   |\n| **Total**            | **12,504**                | **3,805,282**             |\n\nThe Konkan is bounded by Gujar\u00e1t on the north, by the Deccan on the east, by North K\u00e1nara District on the south, and by the Arabian Sea on the west.\n\nThe history of the Konkan will best be gathered from a perusal of the historical portions of the separate articles on the included States and Districts. The earliest dynasty connected with the Konkan is that of the Mauryas, who reigned about three centuries before Christ; but the evidence of the connection rests altogether on\nan Asoka inscription discovered at the town of Sop\u00e1ra in Th\u00e1na District. The dynasties that succeeded were the following, in their order, so far as order is ascertainable:\u2014The Sh\u00e1t\u00e1karnis or Andrabhrityas, with their capital at Paitan in the Deccan; the Mauryas, descendants of the elder house; the Ch\u00e1lukyas; the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras, whose capital was perhaps the island of Elephanta in Bombay Harbour; the Yadavas, with their capital at Deogiri, the modern Daul\u00e1t\u00e1b\u00e1d; the Muhammadans (Khiljis, B\u00e1hmanis, Bij\u00e1pur chiefs, Mughals, and Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d kings); Portuguese commanders (over a limited area); Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s; and British.\n\nThe principal incidents in the annals of the Konkan are of modern interest. The Konkan coast was known to the peoples of Greece and Rome, and both Ptolemy (150 A.D.) and the author of the Periplus (247 A.D.) afford evidence that Greek traders from Egypt dealt with the Konkan ports. Many of these last are named by the Greek geographers; and while the modern representative of the ancient town has been in many instances identified, in others the ingenuity of conjecture is still employed. To take one or two examples, it is yet a matter of uncertainty whether Byzantium is the Konkan pirate fort of Vijayadr\u00fag; whether the word Chersonesus refers to Goa, or whether the term Heptanesia relates to the islands that stud the modern harbour of Bombay.\n\nThe arrival of the Beni-Israel and the P\u00e1rs\u00eds from the Persian Gulf and Persia are important incidents in Konkan history. The Beni-Israel, whom high authority has not hesitated to call the descendants of the lost tribes of Israel, are found all over Bombay Presidency. The descendants of the first P\u00e1rs\u00eds, who landed in Th\u00e1na about the 7th century, now crowd the streets and markets of Bombay, engross a large part of the city\u2019s wealth and principal trading operations, and have their agents in all important provincial towns.\n\nThe Portuguese reached Malabar in 1498, and fixed the head-quarters of their naval dominion at Cheul or Chaul. In 1510, Goa was seized, and from this time until 1630 the Portuguese shared the rule of the Konkan with the Muhammadan kings of Ahmadnagar and Bij\u00e1pur. The rise and fall of the pirate power of the Angr\u00edas, who fixed themselves in the island strongholds of Kol\u00e1ba, Suvarndr\u00fag, and Gheria or Vijayadr\u00fag, and from 1700 to 1756 harassed English, Dutch, and native shipping alike, mark a disastrous period of Konkan history.\n\nSince the British administration was set up in 1818 on the overthrow of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the peace of the whole area, if some disturbances in S\u00e1wantw\u00e1ri in 1844 and 1850 be excepted, has remained unbroken.\n\nThe great city and harbour of Bombay are situated about one-third down the length of the Konkan from the north. The Portuguese territory of Goa used to form its southern limit; but the District of North\nK\u00e1nara has been transferred from Madras to the Bombay Presidency, and now constitutes the southernmost District of the Division known as the Konkan.\n\nPhysical Aspects, Natural History, and Geology.\u2014The following paragraphs have been condensed from a short monograph on the physical features of the Konkan, by Major J. H. Lloyd:\u2014Approaching the coast of the Konkan from seaward, the traveller sees before him a wild-looking country consisting of a confused mass of hills, exhibiting every shade of brown, red, and purple; in some parts coming down to the sea, in others receding and giving space along the shore for tracts of rice cultivation, or belts of cocoa-nut and palm. In the foreground the sea beating on the rocks sets off the picture with a fringe of surf, interrupted at intervals where the coast-line is broken by the mouths of creeks and rivers, and far in the background the eye rests on the line of Gh\u00e1ts, blocking the distant horizon with a long succession of peaks, bluffs, and domes\u2014cool and grey in the morning, misty and indistinct under the glare of noonday, and glowing with pink and violet as the great trap precipices catch the rays of the setting sun. As regards its geology, the Konkan is a country, broadly speaking, of stratified primary rocks. The hills are composed of layers of trap varying in composition, and capped by a stratum of laterite, while the alluvial soil of the valleys is the result of the disintegration and decomposition of these rocks carried down by drainage from the hills.\n\nOn the shores of the salt marshes, locally known as Kh\u00edr, and along the tidal portion of the rivers which empty themselves into the Arabian Sea, the soil is a stiff blue clay which, when reclaimed from the action of the sea, is capable of being converted into rice land of considerable value. The narrow strip of sand along the coast rests on what geologists term littoral concrete, which bears the various species of the palm tree, date, and palmyra in the north, cocoa-nut and arecanut in the south. The annual rainfall of the Konkan is estimated at over 100 inches; and this rainfall added to the enormous body of water thrown off the face of the Western Gh\u00e1ts during the monsoon, the whole traversing the region to the sea, accounts for the numerous rivers and streams in which the Konkan abounds. The general level of the country presents throughout the dry months of the year a parched and barren appearance; but this air of sterility is modified as higher ground is reached.\n\nIn the open cultivated tracts are sun-baked rice-fields, bare hill-sides, dried-up streams, and occasional groves with their denizens of kites, cattle egrets, noisy koels, and active squirrels. In the lower ground are found forests of teak (Tectona grandis), ain (Terminalia romentosa), kinjal (Terminalia paniculata), p\u00e1g\u00e1ri (Erythrina indica).\nand *simul* (Bombax malabaricum); among what scanty foliage there is, the woodpecker, the babbler, and the coppersmith keep up a din of confusing notes. On the higher slopes, the *kokamb* (Garcinia indica), *sissi* (Dalbergia latifolia), and wild plantain spread over the hills, and afford shelter to the green pigeon, green barbet, and bronze-winged doves. On the highest ranges, in the shade of evergreen forests of R\u00e1n-J\u00e1mbul (Eugenia Jambolana), *punschi* (Carallia integerrima), and many others, ferns and mosses adorn the surface of the ground; strange forms of plant and insect life continually demand the naturalist's attention; while the notes of the thrush, blackbird, and *gh\u00e1t* bulbul musically salute his ears.\n\n**Konnagar.**\u2014Village in H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal; situated on the right bank of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river. Lat. 22\u00b0 42' N., long. 88\u00b0 23' E. Inhabited by a large Br\u00e1hman community, but not otherwise of any importance. Station on the East Indian Railway, 9 miles from the Howrah terminus.\n\n**Koosee.**\u2014River in Purniah District, Bengal.\u2014See Kusi.\n\n**Kooshtea.**\u2014Sub-division and town in Nadiy\u00e1 District, Bengal.\u2014See Kushtia.\n\n**Kopaganj.**\u2014Town in Muhammad\u00e1b\u00e1d *tahsil*, Azamgarh District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 0' 40\" N., and long. 83\u00b0 36' 35\" E., on the Gorakhpur and Gh\u00e1zipur road. Population (1872) 66,333; (1881) 63,01, namely, Hindus, 36,16; and Muhammadans, 26,85. Area of town site, 147 acres. For police and conservancy purposes, a house-tax is levied, yielding an income of \u00a3103 in 1881. Founded about the year 1745 by Ir\u00e1dat Kh\u00e1n, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Azamgarh. Country cloth is woven. Exports of sugar and grain; imports of piece-goods, metal, and manufactured wares. The trade, however, is small, and the town is not now of any note. Retail markets twice a week. Police outpost station; post-office.\n\n**Kop\u00e1rg\u00e1oon.**\u2014Sub-division of Ahmadnagar District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 511 square miles; containing 121 villages, and 8956 houses. Population (1872) 66,739; (1881) 63,789, namely, 32,530 males and 31,259 females. In 1881, Hindus numbered 56,472; Muhammadans, 2695; and 'others,' 4622.\n\nKop\u00e1rg\u00e1oon is the most northerly Sub-division of the District, and was formed in 1861\u201362 by splitting up the old Sub-division of P\u00e1toda, which was found too large and unwieldy for administrative purposes. About half the villages now forming Kop\u00e1rg\u00e1oon belonged to P\u00e1toda, and to these were added villages all along the south. The river God\u00e1vari enters at the extreme north-west corner, traverses the Sub-division, and forms for a short distance the eastern boundary. The bed of the river is considerably below the general level of the country, and the high black soil and clay banks are deeply fissured by the numerous minor streams\nwhich drain the Sub-division. Kop\u00e1rg\u00e1on consists of a black soil plain, having a gentle slope from both sides towards the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri. In most of the villages the people are dependent on wells for their water supply, as all but the largest tributaries of the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri run dry shortly after the monsoon rains have ceased. The cultivators of Kop\u00e1rg\u00e1on are in an impoverished condition, attributable in a great measure to the frequent occurrence of bad seasons. Sudden and violent showers, which deluge the country, are often succeeded by a long and continued drought. Out of the eleven years ending 1884, six have been seasons of partial or absolute famine.\n\nKop\u00e1rg\u00e1on until recently possessed only one made road, the old military route from Ahmadnagar to M\u00e1legaon, now maintained from Provincial Funds; but it enjoys the advantage of numerous fair-weather tracks. The Dhond-Manm\u00e1r State Railway traverses the Sub-division from south to north, with stations at Bel\u00e1pur, Chit\u00e1l\u00ed, Punt\u00e1mba, Sanwats\u00e1r, and Kop\u00e1rg\u00e1on Road. The export of grain from the Punt\u00e1mba station in 1880 amounted to 1175 tons.\n\nOf a total area of 511 square miles, 509 have been surveyed in detail. Of these, 4283 acres are the lands of alienated villages. The rest includes 290,874 acres of cultivable land; 17,588 acres of uncultivable land; 269 acres under grass; 2988 acres of forest reserves; and 10,116 acres of village sites, roads, and river-beds. Of the 290,874 acres of cultivable land, 21,636 acres are alienated lands in Government villages. Of 269,238 acres (the actual area of Government cultivable land), 254,274 acres were in 1882\u201383 held for tillage. Of these, 244,979 acres were under dry crops, and 9295 acres were watered garden land. Of 198,982 acres, the actual area under cultivation in 1881\u201382, grain crops occupied 186,399 acres; pulses, 9528 acres; oil-seeds, 506 acres; fibres, 80 acres; and miscellaneous crops, 2469 acres.\n\nThe Sub-division contains 2 civil and 3 criminal courts. There is a police station (th\u00e1n\u00e1); regular police, 30 men; village watchmen (chank\u00edd\u00e1s), 162. Six weekly markets; 21 village schools for boys and 2 for girls.\n\nKop\u00e1rg\u00e1on.\u2014Village in Kop\u00e1rg\u00e1on Sub-division, Ahmadnagar District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 19\u00b0 54' N., long. 74\u00b0 33' E. The head-quarters of the Sub-division, 60 miles north of Ahmadnagar city, on the north bank of the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri river. Kop\u00e1rg\u00e1on was the favourite residence of R\u00e1ghuba, the father of B\u00e1ji R\u00e1o, the last Peshw\u00e1. His palace is now used as the sub-divisional office. Population (1881) 2020. In 1804, B\u00e1l\u00e1j\u00ed Lakshman, the Peshw\u00e1's governor of Kh\u00e1ndesh, inveigled 7000 Bhils into his power at Kop\u00e1rg\u00e1on, and threw most of them into two wells. In 1818, on the final overthrow of the Peshw\u00e1's power, Kop\u00e1rg\u00e1on was occupied by Madras troops. Subordinate judge's court, and a weekly market held on Monday. The Kop\u00e1rg\u00e1on Road station on the Dhond-Manm\u00e1r State Railway is two miles from the village.\nKopil\u00e1s.\u2014Hill in Dhenk\u00e1nal State, Orissa. Lat. 20\u00b0 40' 40\" N., long. 85\u00b0 48' 53\" E.; height, 2098 feet. The hill takes its name from a temple situated near its summit, which in February of every year is visited by about 10,000 pilgrims, on which occasion a large fair is held, and considerable trade carried on. At the top of the hill is a table-land, which might be made a pleasant place of residence during the hot months.\n\nKopili.\u2014River of Assam.\u2014See Kapili.\n\nKoppa.\u2014T\u00e1luk in Kad\u00far District, Mysore State. Area, 503 square miles, of which only 75 are cultivated. Population (1872) 35,799; (1881) 40,287, namely, 23,112 males and 17,175 females. In 1881, Hindus numbered 39,023; Muhammadans, 978; and Christians, 286. Revenue (1883\u201384), exclusive of water rates, \u00a324,760, or 10s. per cultivated acre. The Koppa t\u00e1luk is entirely Maln\u00e1d, or high land. It contains the sources of the Tunga river, and the sacred site of Sringeri, founded in the 8th century by the Sivaite apostle Sankar\u00e1ch\u00e1rya. Country clothed with the finest forest. Products\u2014coffee, extensively cultivated in the hill ranges to the north, and on the slopes of the Western Gh\u00e1ts; rice, areca-nut, and cardamoms. The t\u00e1luk contains 2 criminal courts and 7 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); regular police, 58 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 10. The head-quarters of the t\u00e1luk are at the village of HARIHARPUR.\n\nKoppa.\u2014Village in the t\u00e1luk of the same name in Kad\u00far District, Mysore State. Lat. 13\u00b0 32' 4\" N., long. 75\u00b0 21' 51\" E. Situated about two miles to the east of Hariharpur.\n\nKora (Corah).\u2014Western tahsil or Sub-division of Fatehpur District, North-Western Provinces; lying along the northern bank of the Jumna, and consisting of a cultivable plain, intersected by jungle-clad ravines. The tahsil is divided into three portions by the rivers Rind and N\u00fan, which pass through it from west to south-east. In the northern and central tract there is well-irrigation, but the southern tract is generally unirrigated. The irrigation is entirely from wells and tanks, the rivers not being used at all for that purpose. The most important soils are \u2014irrigated d\u00edumat, covering 22 per cent., and unirrigated d\u00edumat, which extends over about 30 per cent. of the cultivated area. About 13 per cent. of the area under cultivation consists of s\u00edg\u00f3n. The rabi, or spring crops, which occupy about two-thirds of the cultivated area, consist chiefly of birra, wheat, and gram; and the autumn crops of jo\u00e1r, b\u00e1jra, and cotton.\n\nThe area of the tahsil, according to the latest official statement (1881), was 230 square miles, of which 132 square miles were cultivated; 35'4 square miles cultivable; and 62'1 square miles uncultivable waste. The area paying Government revenue or quit-rent was 229'4 square miles, of which 132'1 square miles were cultivated. Government land revenue,\n\u00a319,231; total Government revenue, including rates and cesses, \u00a322,613; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a332,618. Population (1872) 91,207; (1881) 81,164, namely, males 40,898, and females 40,266, showing a decrease of 10,043, or 11 per cent. in the nine years since 1872. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 75,486; Muhammadans, 5620; and Jains, 58. Of the 217 villages comprising the tahsil, 152 had less than five hundred inhabitants.\n\nKora is well supplied with roads, and a metalled road connects it with the Mauh\u00e1r station on the East Indian Railway. In 1884, the Subdivision contained 1 criminal court, 3 police circles (thdnis), with a regular police of 32 men, and a village watch of 165 chaukidars.\n\n**Kora (Corah).**\u2014Town in Fatehpur District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Kora tahsil. Lat. 26\u00b0 6' 35\" N., long. 80\u00b0 24' 20\" E. Situated on the old Mughal road from Agra to Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. Capital of a subah under the Mughal Empire, and still retaining many architectural relics of its former magnificence. Amongst them the most noticeable are\u2014the B\u00e1rad\u00e1ri of R\u00e1o L\u00e1l Bah\u00e1dur, a large enclosed garden with two pleasure-houses, built towards the close of the last century, under the Oudh Waz\u00edrs; the Sorahi or mausoleum, a mile west of Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d; the sard\u00ed or travellers\u2019 halting-place in Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d, with handsome old walls and gates; and a magnificent tank of great size and depth, still retaining a constant supply of clear water. The old fort is now used as the tahs\u00edli, and contains the Government courts and offices. The Th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ra, opposite the B\u00e1rad\u00e1ri, is a modern building of some interest.\n\nPopulation (1881) 2650, namely, males 1198, and females 1452. The two towns of Kora and Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d are situated on opposite sides of the road, and are known as one under the name of Kora-Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d, although they are separately administered under Act xx. of 1856. Kora was formerly the seat of considerable trade; but lying as it does on the Mughal imperial highway, away from the modern Grand Trunk Road and Railway, much of its business has been diverted to other places more favourably situated. It is, however, still a market for agricultural produce, and copper and bell-metal vessels are manufactured in some quantity. The town contains many old and substantially built houses, mostly, however, in a ruined state.\n\n**Kor\u00e1 (or K\u00e1ro).**\u2014Hill in B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 District, Bengal; on the east of the provincial road from R\u00e1niganj to B\u00e1nkur\u00e1.

The chief village, Korba, is situated on the river Hasd\u00fa, 48 miles east of Bil\u00e1spur town, in lat. $22^\\circ 21'$ N., and long. $82^\\circ 45'$ E. Though wild and poorly cultivated, the estate possesses timber and coal, and with better communications would be valuable. At present it exports tas\u00e1r silk. The chief is a Kunw\u00e1r.\nKorea.\u2014Native State of Chuti\u00e1 Nagpur, Bengal, lying between $22^\\circ 55' 50''$ and $23^\\circ 49' 15''$ N. lat., and between $81^\\circ 58' 15''$ and $82^\\circ 48' 15''$ E. long. Bounded on the north by Rew\u00e1 State; on the east by Sarguj\u00e1; on the south by Bil\u00e1spur District in the Central Provinces; and on the west by Ch\u00e1ng Bhuk\u00e1r and Rew\u00e1. Korea consists of an elevated table-land of coarse sandstone overlying the coal measures, from which spring several abruptly scarped plateaux, varying in height, and irregularly distributed over the surface. To the east is the Sonh\u00e1t plateau, with an elevation of 2477 feet; the north of the State is occupied by a still higher table-land, with a maximum elevation of 3367 feet. In the west a group of hills culminates in Deogarh Peak, 3370 feet. Several streams rise in the hills, of which the largest is the Heshto, a tributary of the Mah\u00e1nadi. Large forest tracts of sal timber exist, but have not hitherto been utilized. Alternating with the forest areas are wide stretches of pasture land, from which grazing dues to the extent of about \u00a3150 a year are realized. Iron is found throughout the State, and a tribe of Kols, called Agari\u00e1s from their occupation, are largely engaged in iron-smelting. Good coal is found in the Bar\u00e1kh\u00e1r rocks, which form the upper surface in the northern part of the State; and underlying the Mah\u00e1deva sandstones forming the central plateau. Crops consist of rice, wheat, barley, Indian corn, marua, pulses, oil-seeds, cotton, etc. Jungle products, stick-lac and resin. Tigers and wild elephants formerly committed serious depredations; but of late years the former have been reduced by increased rewards for their destruction, and the elephants have been captured or driven out by successful kheda operations.\n\nThe area of the State is 1625 square miles, containing in 1881, 249 villages, 5798 houses, and a total population of 29,846 persons. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 29,638, and Muhammadans 208.

Of aboriginal tribes (although not returned separately in the Census Report of 1881), the most numerous and influential are the Gonds, who numbered 4644 in 1872; the two leading sub-proprietors of the State belong to this tribe. Next in importance are the Cherus (3009 in 1872). These tribes are returned as Hindus according to religion. The principal village and the residence of the chief is Sonh\u00e1t, situated on the plateau so named, at an elevation of 2477 feet; lat. $82^\\circ 35' N.$, long. $23^\\circ 28' E$. The chief's family call themselves Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jputs, and claim descent from a chief of that clan, who conquered Korea 600 years ago.

Area, 349 square miles; containing 1 town and 73 villages, with 11,033 houses. Population (1872) 89,930; (1881) 81,187, namely, 39,392 males and 41,795 females. In 1881, Hindus numbered 78,548; Muhammadans, 2196; and \u2018others,\u2019 443. In 1884, the Sub-division contained 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; police station, 1; regular police, 49 men; village watch, 99. Land revenue, \u00a324,429.\n\n**Kori.**\u2014River in the Native State of Cutch, Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency. Kori is the name applied to the eastern mouth of the Indus. Although of little value for trade or irrigation, the locality is of historic interest. Alexander the Great (325 B.C.) and Ptolemy (125 A.D.) knew it as Lonibare, a chief entrance to the Indus. About 1000 A.D. the main stream appears to have turned to the west; but as late as the middle of the 18th century the Koli branch had water enough to irrigate the State of Lakhpat. According to tradition, the river was deep enough to have a port at Sindhi, 50 miles up; then shoaling, the port had to be moved 14 miles lower down to Sindu. Afterwards the port was fixed at Lakhpat, 20 miles from the mouth; and now the port is at Koteswar. These changes are attributed to the change in the course of the main stream of the Indus. One period of this change was particularly disastrous. During the 11th or 12th century, while the change was in progress, the great city of Alor and \u20181000 towns\u2019 were swept away. In 1764, when the people of Cutch were beaten by the people of Sind, Ghul\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, the Sindhi conqueror, built an immense dam across the Kori, which almost entirely prevented the Lakhpat rice-land irrigation, and caused a loss of revenue to Cutch of \u00a320,000 a year.\n\n**Korig\u00e1um.**\u2014Town in Poona (P\u00fana) District, Bombay Presidency. Situated on the right bank of the Bhima river, sixteen miles south of Poona city; the scene of the last of the three battles which led to the collapse of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power. The battle was fought on the 1st January 1818 between Captain Stanton and B\u00e1ji R\u00e1o Peshw\u00e1. Captain Stanton, on his march to strengthen Colonel Burr, arrived at Korig\u00e1um in the morning after a fatiguing night march, with a detachment of 500 Bombay Native Infantry, 300 irregular horse, and two 6-pounders manned by 24 Madras artillerymen. He found the whole army of the\nPeshw\u00e1, some 20,000 strong, encamped on the opposite bank of the Bh\u00edma river. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 troops were immediately sent across against the exhausted handful of soldiers, destitute of both provisions and water. The engagement was kept up throughout the day, and resulted in the discomfiture and retreat of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The remarkable feature of this engagement was that the British troops were all natives, without any European support excepting 24 artillerymen, of whom 20 were killed and wounded. Of seven officers engaged, four were killed and one wounded; total casualties, 276 killed, wounded, and missing. This gallant fight is now commemorated by a stone obelisk.\n\n**Kortalaiy\u00e1ru.**\u2014River in North Arcot and Chengalpat Districts, Madras Presidency.\u2014See CORTELLIAR.\n\n**Kosala.**\u2014Ancient Division of India. It was estimated by Hiuen Tsiang (7th century) at 6000 li or 1000 miles in circuit. Its frontiers are not named; but we know from the pilgrim\u2019s Itinerary that it must have been bounded by Ujjain on the north, by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shtra on the west, by Orissa on the east, and by Andhra and Kalinga on the south. The limits of the kingdom may be roughly described as extending from near Burh\u00e1npur on the T\u00e1pti, and Nanda on the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri, to Ratanpur in Chhat\u00edsgarh, and Naw\u00e1gadha near the source of the Mah\u00e1nadi. Within these limits the circuit of the large tract assigned to Kosala is rather more than 1000 miles.\u2014See AJODHYA.\n\n**Kosa N\u00e1g** (*Kaiser Nag*, *Quaizar Nag*?).\u2014Mountain lake and place of pilgrimage in Kashmir State, Northern India, on the north side of the Fateh Panj\u00e1l Mountains. Lat. 33\u00b0 30' N., long. 74\u00b0 52' E. According to Thornton, it is three-quarters of a mile in length, by 500 yards in breadth. Supplied by the melting of the snow. Gives rise to the river Veshau, a tributary of the Jehlam. Venerated by the Hindus under the name of Vishnu P\u00e1dh, from a legend that the god produced it by stamping with his foot. Estimated elevation above sea-level, 12,000 feet.\n\n**Kosi.**\u2014North-western tahsil of Muttra (Mathura) District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the western bank of the Jumna, and consisting mainly of an arid plain, intersected by ravines. Area (1881-82), 153 square miles, of which 125 square miles are cultivated, 19.8 square miles cultivable, and 8.2 square miles uncultivable waste. Of the total cultivated area, 83,117 acres, or 26 per cent., are irrigated from the Agra Canal, which intersects the tahsil, crossing the Delhi road about a mile south of Kosi town. Land revenue, \u00a316,720; total Government revenue, including rates and cesses, \u00a318,727; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a322,937. Population (1872) 73,808; (1881) 65,293, namely, males 34,002, and females 31,291, showing a decrease of 8515, or 11.5 per cent., in the nine years since 1872. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 56,275; Muhammadans,\n8093; Jains, 924; 'other,' 1. Of the 55 villages comprising the tahsil, 14 contained less than five hundred inhabitants.\n\nThe crops most extensively grown in Kosi tahsil are jo\u00e1r, gram, and barley. The villages, with but a few exceptions, are held under bh\u00e1yach\u00e1ra tenure, divided into infinitesimal shares among village communities; so that, excepting a few shopkeepers and menial servants, almost every resident is, to some extent, a landed proprietor. As a natural result of this sub-division of estates, there is not a single large landed proprietor. In 1883, the tahsil contained 1 criminal court, with 3 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), a regular police force numbering 42 men, besides 190 village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs).\n\nKosi.\u2014Town and municipality in Muttra (Mathura) District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Kosi tahsil. Stands in lat. 27\u00b0 47' 40\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 28' 45\" E., on the open plain, 10 miles west of the Jumna, and 29 miles north-west of Muttra town, on the metalled road to Delhi. Population (1872) 12,770; (1881) 11,231, namely, Hindus, 6831; Muhammadans, 3866; Jains, 533; and Christian, 1. The town contains the largest cattle mart in the District, police station, post-office, dispensary, and Anglo-vernacular school. The streets are fairly well drained, and paved with brick and stone. During the Mutiny, the District officials took refuge at Kosi for a while, but were compelled to flee by the defection of the Bhartpur (Bhurtpore) force. The townspeople, however, remained well affected. Municipal revenue in 1881-82, \u00a31077, or 1s. 11d. per head of population.\n\nKosigi.\u2014Town in Adoni t\u00e1luk, Bellary District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 15\u00b0 51' N., long. 78\u00b0 17' E.; 18 miles north of Adoni. Population (1881) 4907. Hindus numbered 4530; Muhammadans, 376; and Christian, 1. Number of houses, 979. An irregularly-built town, containing not a single good street. It is situated at the foot of a rock, on which stand the ruins of fortifications and temples. According to tradition, Kosigi was founded by S\u00farap\u00e1h Naik, an officer of the Anigundi R\u00e1j\u00e1, who visited the place on a marauding expedition. Not far from the town is a curious isolated rock known by the name of 'The Sisters'\u2014Akkachellelu. The north-west line of the Madras Railway has a station here.\n\nKot\u00e1.\u2014Village in G\u00fad\u00far t\u00e1luk, Nellore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 14\u00b0 3' N., long. 80\u00b0 5' E. Population (1881) 4400; number of houses, 978. Hindus numbered 4242, and Muhammadans, 158. Station of a sub-magistrate. Police station and post-office.\n\nKot\u00e1.\u2014Village in W\u00fan District, Ber\u00e1r. Lat. 20\u00b0 31' 30\" N., long. 78\u00b0 19' E.; 14 miles north-east of Yeotm\u00e1l. Contains 434 houses; population (1881) 1951. Large weekly market. Police station, school, and ser\u00e1i.\n\nKota (or Kotu, Koter, Kotar, Kohatur, Kottur).\u2014A primitive tribe\ninhabiting the Nilgiri Hills, Madras Presidency. The Kotas profess to have no traditions; but the Todas, another primitive tribe of the Nilgiris, assert that the Kotas were a caste of artisans, brought from the plains to work for the Todas on certain conditions. The Kota men, according to Dr. Shortt, 'are well made and of tolerable height, rather good-featured and light-skinned, having a copper colour, and some of them are the fairest-skinned among the hill tribes. They have well-formed heads covered with long black hair, grown long and let loose, or tied up carelessly at the back of the head.' The women are of moderate height, of fair build of body, but not so good-looking as the men. They have more of a snub nose, and a somewhat vacant expression. The Kotas recognise no caste among themselves, but are divided into keris, and a man of one keri must seek a wife in another. They are not allowed to keep buffaloes; but they have cows, which they neither milk for consumption nor for sale. The buffaloes are kept by the Todas, by whom the Kotas are called kuof or cow-people. The Kotas eat all sorts of flesh, even carrion. Mr. Metz observes that 'at no time do they thrive so well as when there is a murrain among the herds of the Todas and Badagas.' They are addicted to drinking and opium-smoking. All the other hill tribes have a great contempt for the Kotas on account of their eating carrion. They live in villages of from 50 to 60 houses, built of mud and thatch, and irregularly arranged. The verandahs of some houses have stone pillars, sculptured by cutters from the low country. In each village, one or two houses are set apart, to which the women retire during seasons of purification.\n\nThe Kotas worship one God, Kam\u00e1tar\u00e1ya, and his wife; each of whom is represented by a silver plate. They have two great annual festivals, one in honour of Kam\u00e1tar\u00e1ya, and the other in honour of the dead who have died during the year. The former lasts for a fortnight. Their national dance requires six or eight performers, who stand in a row, their motions being uniform. The main characteristic of the dance is the way in which the draperies of the performers swing to and fro with the measure.\n\nThe Kotas marry only one wife, unless she should be barren, when they may take another; in this case the two wives live together in the same house. Widows may re-marry. The Kotas have two funeral ceremonies, at both of which cows and buffaloes are slaughtered. After ceremonies performed in the house, the corpse is taken to the du\u00e9 or burning ground, and burnt with certain implements of the deceased. The bones are then collected, and buried near the burning place, and a stone is placed over them. The skull is, however, kept till the 'dry' or second funeral, which must take place on a Monday or Thursday. At the 'dry' funeral each skull is wrapped in a new cloth and placed on a cot; and after certain ceremonies the skulls are\nburned, together with the bows, arrows, and other implements of the deceased.\n\nThe Kota language is a dialect of K\u00e1narese. The Kotas are the artisans of the hills, and are necessary to all the tribes as their blacksmiths, carpenters, tanners, rope and umbrella makers, potters, musicians, and workers in gold and silver. The Kotas in 1881 numbered 1062.\n\n**Kot Adu.**\u2014Town in Sin\u00e1nw\u00e1n tahsil, Muzaffargarh District, Punjab. Lat. 30\u00b0 28' 14\" N., long. 71\u00b0 0' 30\" E. Situated on the road from Muzaffargarh to Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, 33 miles from Muzaffargarh town, and 10 miles from the river Indus, in lat. 30\u00b0 28' 14\" N., long. 71\u00b0 0' 30\" E. Population (1868) 2761; (1881) 2574, namely, Hindus, 1627; Muhammadans, 946; and Sikh, 1. Number of houses, 460. Municipal income (1881-82), \u00a3107. Kot Adu is in all respects an ordinary village with narrow lanes and mud-built houses, and derives its only importance from being an agricultural centre, a halting-place for travellers marching along the left bank of the Indus, and the largest village in the Sin\u00e1nw\u00e1n tahsil, of which it was at one time the headquarters. Its only manufacture is that of ornamented bows and arrows. Police outpost station, rest-house, school, and dispensary.\n\n**Kot\u00e1e.**\u2014Remains of an old city, twelve miles north of Bh\u00faj, on the shores of the Rann of Cutch (Kachchh), with several ruined temples of perhaps the early part of the 10th century. The Sun temple, known as R\u00e1 L\u00e1kha's, ascribed to L\u00e1kha Phul\u00e1ni, who is said to have fixed his capital here for a time, is built of the yellowish and red stone used also at Ker\u00e1, and is roofed in a peculiar way. The aisles are covered by a sort of groins, like the side-aisles in some Chaitya caves; the nave is roofed the same way as at the Amarn\u00e1th temple,\u2014the central area being covered with massive slabs hollowed out in the centre, in which a pendant has been inserted. Outside, it has a slanting roof divided into four sections of slightly different heights, that next to the spire being the highest, and the remote end the lowest; each section is terminated by a neatly carved gable-end. The whole has been built without any cement, and most of the stones are hollowed out on the under or inner side as if for the purpose of making them lighter. The porch has long since fallen away. The door of the temple has been neatly carved with the nine grahas or patrons of the planets over the lintel; the jambs are also carefully sculptured. The shrine door is elaborately carved with two rows of figures on the frieze, Ganapati on the lintel, and the jambs richly ornamented. The area behind the central jamb is roofed with large slabs, carved with sixteen female figures linked in one another's arms in a circle, with the legs crossed and turned towards the centre. Each holds a rod or bar in either hand, the left hand being bent down and\nthe right up, and so interlaced with the arms of the figures on either side. In two neat gokhlas or niches, advanced from the front wall of the shrine, and with two colonnettes in front of each, there have been standing images in alto relievo, neatly canopied by a lotus flower and buds growing over the muguts or head-dresses. Enormously elongated munis or bhringis seem to have been the supporters.\n\nBeyond a ravine to the north-east are fragments of two other temples facing west. Of the first, and higher up of the two, only plain square pillars of the mandap and the lower part of the rimana are standing. The general style is the same as that of the other temples, but much plainer. The stones are cut away below as at the first temple. The lower of the two is also only a fragment of the shrine of a Surya temple, with Ganapati on the lintel, and the nine grahas on the frieze. There are no figures outside. Foundations still remain on this part of the hill, showing that whole edifices must have been carted away for building purposes elsewhere.\u2014BURGESS\u2019 Archaeological Survey of Western India.\n\nKot\u00e1giri.\u2014Hill station and tea-growing centre in Nilgiri District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 11\u00b0 20' to 11\u00b0 20' 10\" N., long. 76\u00b0 51' to 76\u00b0 56' E. Contains 934 houses and (1881) 3691 inhabitants. Area, about 12 square miles. It is in the Paraganad N\u00e1d, situated at the north-east end of the plateau, 17 miles from Ut\u00e1kamand (Ootacamund), and 12 from Coonoor, at an average height of 6500 feet above sea-level. In the opinion of residents, it has the best climate to be found on these hills; and the Marquis of Dalhousie preferred it to Ut\u00e1kamand. The station, which was founded in 1830, has 12 or 15 European houses, and a small church. The residents are nearly all proprietors of neighbouring tea estates. The annual rainfall is about 50 inches. Near Kot\u00e1giri is the military sanitarium of Dimhatti, now abandoned. A gh\u00e1t or pass in fair order leads from Kot\u00e1giri to the plains of Coimbatore. Dispensary, rest-house, bazaar, police station, and post-office.\n\nKotah.\u2014Native State in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, under the political superintendence of the Kotah Agency. The State lies between 24\u00b0 30' and 25\u00b0 51' N. lat., and between 75\u00b0 40' and 76\u00b0 59' E. long. Bounded on the north and north-west by the river Chambal, which separates it from B\u00fand\u00ed (Boondee) State; on the east by Gwalior, the Tonk district of Chhapra, and by part of Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r; on the south by the Mokandarra Hills and Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r; and on the west by Udaipur (Oodeypore). Area, 3797 square miles. Population (1881) 517,275; density of population, 136 persons per square mile. Chief town, Kotah.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Kotah State slopes gently northwards from the high table-land of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, and is drained by the Chambal with its\ntributaries, all flowing in a northerly or north-easterly direction. The Mokandarra range, from 1200 to 1600 feet above sea-level, runs from south-east to north-west, forming the southern border of Kotah, and separating it from Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r. The Mokandarra Pass through these hills, in the neighbourhood of the highest peak (1671 feet), has been rendered memorable by the passage of Colonel Monson\u2019s army on its disastrous retreat in 1804. The defile is strikingly picturesque, and forms one of the chief outlets between the Deccan and Northern India. The hills are for the most part clothed with a thick jungle of stunted trees and undergrowth. There are no forests of any size, but several extensive game preserves, chiefly covered with grass. The largest of these is about 7 miles from the city of Kotah, and is 12 miles in length, with an average breadth of 4 miles. Of the tributaries of the Chambal within the State, the K\u00e1l\u00ed Sind, with its feeder, the Parw\u00e1n, is the principal. It enters Kotah from the south, and joins the Chambal near the village of Piparda. The P\u00e1rb\u00e1t flows due north for 80 miles, and falls into the Chambal in the extreme north-eastern corner of the territory. It forms the north and south-eastern boundary of the State for a considerable portion of its length, separating it from the Chhapra pargan\u00e1 of Tonk on the south, and from Gwalior on the north. The rivers contain trout and mahsir, besides other fish; crocodiles are numerous, and those in the Chambal are of large size. There are no natural lakes, but numerous small artificial tanks, for irrigation purposes, have been made by throwing masonry embankments across watercourses. The wild animals of the State include the \u2018golden\u2019 lion, the tiger, four varieties of leopards, two of cheetahs (hunting leopard), hy\u00e6na, wolf, bear, jackal, wild dog, etc.; the bison, the s\u00e1mbhar, the nilgai, the chital (spotted deer), and antelope. Kotah is celebrated for its parrots; birds of every variety abound.\n\nHistory.\u2014The territory of Kotah is an offshoot from B\u00fand\u00ed (Boondee), forming with that State the tract named H\u00e1r\u00e1oti after the dominant tribe of H\u00e1ra R\u00e1jputs. About the year 1625, Kotah and its dependencies were bestowed on Madhu Singh, second son of R\u00e1o Rattan of B\u00fand\u00ed, in acknowledgment of his services during the campaign which forced the imperial prince, who afterwards became the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, to flee almost unattended from Burh\u00e1npur. Madhu R\u00e1o, who assumed the rank and title of R\u00e1j\u00e1, ruled for several years. He distinguished himself as a commander in the Mughal service; and his territory was augmented until it touched M\u00e1lw\u00e1 on one side, and B\u00fand\u00ed on the other. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Mokand Singh, who with his four brothers fought desperately in a battle at Ujjain, against the revolt headed by Prince Alamg\u00edr, afterwards the Emperor Aurangzeb. All the brothers were slain, with the exception of the youngest, Kishor Singh, who, though desperately\nwounded, eventually recovered. The son of Mokand Singh, Jagat Singh, succeeded to the dignity of R\u00e1j\u00e1. In the beginning of the 18th century, the State, already weakened by civil dissensions, was attacked by Jaipur (Jeypore), and also by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who successfully enforced their claims to tribute. Kotah was only saved from absolute ruin at this juncture by the talents of the minister Z\u00e1l\u00edm Singh, into whose hand the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1o Umed Singh surrendered all power (see Jhalawar). By playing off one party against another, Z\u00e1l\u00edm Singh succeeded in piloting the State safely through the storms of a period in which the whole of Central India was desolated by Mar\u00e1th\u00e1, Pind\u00e1ri, and other predatory hordes; and in the course of forty-five years, he raised Kotah to the rank of one of the most flourishing and powerful States in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. He was one of the first R\u00e1jput chiefs to co-operate with the British Government for the suppression of the Pind\u00e1ris.\n\nThrough Z\u00e1l\u00edm Singh a treaty was made in 1817 by which Kotah was taken under British protection; the tribute formerly paid to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s was made payable to the British Government, who accounted to Sindhia for his share; and the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1o agreed to furnish troops when required. A supplementary article vested the administration in Z\u00e1l\u00edm Singh and his heirs for ever. Even during Z\u00e1l\u00edm Singh\u2019s lifetime, on the succession of a new chief, inconvenience was felt through this arrangement, and a British force had to be sent to insist upon it. On Z\u00e1l\u00edm Singh\u2019s death, his son was notoriously unfit to govern the State; and hence it was finally resolved, in 1838, with the consent of the chief of Kotah, to dismember the State, and to create a new principality of Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r as a separate provision for the descendants of Z\u00e1l\u00edm Singh (see Jhalawar). The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1o\u2019s tribute was reduced by \u00a38000, which sum was to be paid by Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r, and he agreed to maintain an auxiliary force at a cost of not less than 3 l\u00f3khs of rupees (say \u00a330,000). This auxiliary force, known as the Kotah contingent, mutinied in 1857. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1o\u2019s troops also revolted, and murdered the Political Agent and his two sons. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1o made no attempt to assist the Political Agent, and, as a mark of the displeasure of Government, his salute was reduced from 17 to 13 guns.\n\nThe present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1o, Chhatra S\u00e1l, a Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jput, was born about 1837. He succeeded his father in 1866, and on his accession he was restored the full salute of 17 guns, and has also been guaranteed the right of adoption.\n\nA few years later, the confusion into which the affairs of the State had fallen induced the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1o to request the interference of the British Government. Naw\u00e1b Sir Fa\u00edz Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur, K.C.S.I., was thereupon appointed in 1874 to administer the State, subject to the advice\nand control of the Governor-General's Agent in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Since his departure from Kotah, the administration has been superintended by a British political officer.\n\nThere are in Kotah many nobles, generally the descendants of former R\u00e1j\u00e1s through a cadet branch, who, as a rule, hold their estates on a semi-feudal tenure. The State claims to be the absolute owner of all the soil in the territory. Even j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs of the highest class have no power to dispose of their lands by sale. A j\u00e1gir once granted on a feudal tenure cannot be resumed except for disloyalty or misconduct; the grantee has, however, the power of alienating a portion of his grant as a provision for younger sons or other near relatives, and he may raise money on it by mortgage, but this cannot be foreclosed. The present policy of native chiefs tends towards making their subjects of the agricultural class mere tenants-at-will. Yet, as shown by Colonel Tod, the r\u00e1yats have certain bapoti (or ancestral occupancy) rights, which even arbitrary native governments are chary of interfering with. So long as the cultivator pays all his instalments of rent due, his land cannot be resumed or granted to another. All classes depend for their subsistence on the produce of the soil. The majority of the cultivators are poverty-stricken, and live from hand to mouth, although many tracts produce enough grain for exportation in considerable quantities after the needs of home consumption are satisfied.\n\nCrops, etc.\u2014In addition to the usual Indian grains, wheat, cotton, opium, and a little tobacco of good quality are cultivated. Rotation of crops is known and practised to a certain extent. The manufactures are very limited. Cotton fabrics are woven, but are being rapidly superseded by the products of Bombay and Manchester. Articles of wooden furniture are also constructed. The chief articles of export from the State are opium and grain. The imports chiefly consist of salt, cotton, and woollen cloth.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Previous to 1881, no regular Census had ever been taken of the whole territory. The enumeration of that year showed the total population of the State to be 517,275, males numbering 269,924, and females 247,351. This population dwelt in six towns and 1605 villages, and occupied 130,698 houses. Number of persons per square mile of area, 136\u00b72; number of persons per house, 3\u00b79. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 479,634; Muhammadans, 32,866; Jains, 4750; and Christians, 25. Among the Hindus, 43,458 were returned as Br\u00e1hmans, 15,255 as R\u00e1jputs, 425,671 as 'other Hindu castes,' which included 20,717 Mah\u00e1jans or Baniy\u00e1s, 33,488 G\u00fajars, 5009 J\u00e1ts, 1754 Kachhis, 6576 Ah\u00edrs, 46,925 M\u00edn\u00e1s, 48,882 Cham\u00e1rs, 43,469 Dhakurs, 16,773 Balais, 8801 Bhils, and 193,277 'others.' The Muhammadans, classified according to tribes,\nare thus distributed:\u2014Shaikhs, 18,545; Sayyids, 1828; Mughals, 542; Pathans, 9078; and \u2018others,\u2019 2873. The male population is classified into the following seven main groups, namely:\u2014(1) Agriculture, 74,818; (2) day labour, 66,805; (3) handicraft, 20,399; (4) trade, 14,387; (5) service, 21,039; (6) miscellaneous, 30,244; and (7) no occupation, 42,232. About 90 per cent. of the feudal jagirdars belong to the clan of the ruling family.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The gross revenue for the year 1881-82 was \u00a3294,197, of which the land yielded \u00a3177,321. The expenditure in the same year amounted to \u00a3239,666, of which \u00a338,472, including \u00a320,000 for maintenance of a contingent force, formed tribute due to the British Government, and \u00a31439 tribute due to Jaipur (Jeypore).\n\nThe criminal court at the capital is presided over by a Faujd\u00e1r, with a staff of ministerial subordinates. He has the power of inflicting penalties up to one year\u2019s imprisonment, a fine of \u00a320, and whipping to the extent of 12 stripes. A special constabulary, and one central jail for the whole State, have been established at the capital since the introduction of the present administration. The jail, and the jail and city police, are presided over by the judge of the chief appellate court. For police purposes, the State is divided into 19 thinds, with special road guards for the protection of travellers and traffic. Guards are detailed by turns from the different regiments, and relieved yearly.\n\nNo regular department of education has as yet been devised for Kotah. There is a school at the capital, in which English, Persian, Sanskrit, and Hind\u00ed are taught. The staff consists of 9 teachers, and the average attendance of pupils is 210. The State maintains no schools; but the principal villages possess indigenous institutions, where Gurus, or priests of the Jain sect, teach arithmetic and writing chiefly to sons of Br\u00e1hmans and Baniy\u00e1s, with a view to fitting them for a political or mercantile career.\n\nThe city post-office is the only imperial institution of the kind in the State. The only postal route connected with Kotah is that from Jhalrapatan to Deoli.\n\nThe British contingent supplied by the State of Kotah is now known as the Deoli Irregular Force. The troops which the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1o is allowed to maintain are limited to 15,000 men of all descriptions; there are also 2 field and about 90 other serviceable guns in the State.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate is very sultry during the prevalence of the hot winds at the commencement of summer, and is considered unhealthy during the rainy season. Endemic fever and spleen invariably appear after the close of the rains. The other diseases most prevalent are ophthalmia, venereal, chest, and rheumatic affections. Cholera.\noccasionally breaks out in epidemic form. The mean temperature in 1882 was 82\u00b0 F. The average annual rainfall registered at the city of Kotah, for the seven years ending 1881, was 28.77 inches.\n\n**Kotah.**\u2014The principal town of the State of Kotah in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. It is situated in lat. 25\u00b0 10' N., and long. 75\u00b0 52' E., on the right bank of the river Chambal (here crossed by a ferry), and on the route from Nasr\u00e1b\u00e1d (Nusseer\u00e1b\u00e1d) to S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor). East of the town extends an extensive artificial lake, the Kishor S\u00e1g\u00e1r, which affords great facilities for irrigation. The gardens, however, are neither well laid out nor, until recently, well cared for. The town is of considerable size, and contains a population (1881) of 40,270 persons, namely, Hindus, 30,217; Muhammadans, 9005; and 'others,' 1048. There are many Hindu temples and some mosques. The central jail of the State is established at Kotah, and, for police purposes, the town is divided into 25 wards. There is also a State dispensary, and one school, in which English, Persian, Sanskrit, and Hindi are taught. The post-office in the city is the only imperial institution of the kind within the State. A municipal committee has been formed, and some progress has been made towards the conservancy and sanitation of the city. The heat in Kotah is very great, and there is much sickness during the rainy season. Dr. Moore has pointed out that Kotah, with the Chambal on one side, and the Kishor S\u00e1g\u00e1r Lake on the other, combining to produce a copious percolation of water underneath the city, must always be an unhealthy locality.\n\n**Kotaha.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in the N\u00e1r\u00e1yangarh tahs\u00edl, Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umballa) District, Punjab; consisting of the hill portion of the District, and stretching down for a short distance into the plains. Lat. 30\u00b0 32' 30\" to 30\u00b0 45' 30\" N., and long. 76\u00b0 51' to 77\u00b0 13' E. Area of the hill tract, 97 square miles. Population (1868) 5660, or 58 per square mile. The population of pargan\u00e1s is not returned in the Census Report of 1881. Bounded on the west by the Pinjaur valley, and on the north and east by the N\u00e1han or Sirm\u00far (Sarmor) mountains. The town of Kotaha itself stands in the plains. The hills run in two parallel ranges, continuations of the Siw\u00e1lik chain in N\u00e1han State. Between them flows the river Ghaggar, while the forest of Morni clothes their sides. In its midst lie two considerable lakes, at an elevation of about 2000 feet above sea-level. A hill divides their surface, but some underground communication apparently exists, as the level of both always remains the same. The people regard them as sacred, and a great gathering annually takes place at a ruined temple in honour of Krishna, on the banks of the larger lake.\n\nThe village and fort of Morni are perched high up among the mountain-sides. The people are a simple race, seldom visiting the plains, and clinging to their proprietary rights with the usual\ntenacity of hillmen. Kanets, Bh\u00e1ts, Gujars, and Kolis form the principal castes. Originally ruled by R\u00e1jput Th\u00e1kurs owing allegiance to the Sirm\u00far R\u00e1j\u00e1, Kotaha became an independent principality about the 15th century; and after the suppression of the Gurkha invasion by the British in 1815, was made over once more to its native rulers. In 1849 it came under the same reforms as the other cis-Sutlej States, since which period the representatives of the chiefs have become simple j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs. Hinduism is the almost universal religion. Polyandry, frequent in the neighbouring hill tribes, does not occur. No roads exist passable even by a pony, and the villages are mere clusters of huts. Nevertheless, cultivation has spread over most of the available hill-sides, and irrigation from the Ghaggar or from drainage fertilizes every possible field. The inhabitants are extremely industrious and take great pains in cultivating their terraced slopes.\n\n**Kotai.**\u2014Ruined city on the shores of the Rann of Cutch (Kachchh), Gujar\u00e1t.\u2014See KOTAE.\n\n**Kot\u00e1lpur.**\u2014Village and head-quarters of a police circle (th\u00e1nd\u00e1) in Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal; situated on the road from B\u00e1nkur\u00e1 and Bishnupur to Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d, and thence to Calcutta.

The timber is felled and dragged to the T\u00e1l river, and then floated down the God\u00e1vari. Kot\u00e1palli village is situated in lat. 18\u00b0 13' N., and long. 80\u00b0 49' 30\" E.\n\n**Kotappakonda** (or Yellamunda).\u2014Hill village and celebrated shrine in Narsar\u00e1pet t\u00e1luk, Kistna District, Madras Presidency.

Lat. (centre of State) 31\u00b0 7' N., long. 77\u00b0 15' E. Area, 36 square miles. Population (1881) 5435; revenue, \u00a3606. The chief, Bishnu Chand, a R\u00e1jput, received the title of R\u00e1n\u00e1 for services rendered during the Mutiny of 1857. His family originally came from Patn\u00e1 in Bengal. Mashobra, a suburb of Simla, is in Kothi territory. In a deep valley east of Mashobra is the little hamlet of Sipi, where an annual fair is held every May, which is attended by the people of the neighbouring hills in large numbers, and is also a popular resort of holiday-makers from Simla. Naldera, also in Kothi territory, is a little village situated on a beautiful plateau overlooking the Sutlej, bordering a fine deod\u00e1r forest often occupied by the tents of European visitors from Simla.\n\n**Kothi.**\u2014Petty State in Baghelkhand, under the Baghelkhand Agency, the Central India Agency, and the Government of India. Lat. 24\u00b0 4 to 24\u00b0 53' N., and long. 80\u00b0 39' to 80\u00b0 54' E. The town of Kothi is in lat. 24\u00b0 45' E., long. 80\u00b0 40' N. The ruling family have long retained possession of their j\u00e1g\u00edr, by timely submission to the successive conquerors of Bundelkhand. They were never dispossessed either in the time of the Bundela R\u00e1j\u00e1s or of Ali Bah\u00e1dur. In 1810, a sanad was granted to L\u00e1l D\u00faniapat, the j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r then in possession, making him directly dependent on the British Government, like the other chieftains in Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand. The present (1883) chief, Ran Bah\u00e1dur Singh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bah\u00e1dur of Kothi, is a R\u00e1jput by caste. The area of the State is about 90 square miles; number of villages, 67. Population (1881) 18,386, namely, males 9218, and females 9168. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Hindus, 15,649; Muhammadans, 284; Christians, 6; and aboriginal tribes, 2447. Br\u00e1hmans form the predominant caste, numbering 3490. Estimated revenue of the State, \u00a33529. The chief exercises jurisdiction within his own territory, independent of the British courts of law, except in crimes of a heinous nature, or where Europeans are concerned, when the jurisdiction lies with the Political Agent.\n\n**Kothide.**\u2014Guaranteed Th\u00e1kurate or petty State under the Deputy Bhil or Bhop\u00e1war Agency, Central India. The estate consists of 11\nBh\u00edl paras or hamlets, with a total area of about 4000 acres, 250 acres of which are under cultivation. There are 6 wells for irrigation. Population (1881) 289. Revenue about \u00a350. The Bh\u00famia of Kothide, Moti Singh, born about 1850, is a younger branch of the Garhi family. He holds his villages from the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Dh\u00e1r on the condition of being responsible for robberies committed. The estate is now under British administration, in consequence of the indebtedness of the chief.\n\nKoti.\u2014Petty Hill State in the Punjab, subordinate to Keunth\u00e1l.\u2014See Kothi.\n\nKot\u00edpalli.\u2014Village in R\u00e1machandrapur taluk, God\u00e1vari District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 16\u00b0 40' N., long. 82\u00b0 6' E. Population (1881) 2065; number of houses, 398. This village, situated on the left bank of the Gautama God\u00e1vari, halfway between R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri (R\u00e1jamundry) and Coringa, is the only portion of the District which belongs to the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 of Vizian\u00e1garam, with the exception of a few yards of land at R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri. Kotipalli is considered by the Hindus a very sacred place; every twelfth year the village is crowded with devotees; while near the pagoda the river is looked upon as peculiarly sanctifying.\n\nKot Kam\u00e1li\u00e1.\u2014Town and municipality in Montgomery tahsil, Montgomery District, Punjab. Situated in lat. 30\u00b0 43' 45\" N., and long. 72\u00b0 42' E., on the old high north bank of the R\u00e1vi, 5 miles north-west from the present bed of the river. Distant from Montgomery town 27 miles west, from Ch\u00edchawatni railway station 13 miles north. Kam\u00e1li\u00e1 is a very ancient town, and is identified by General Cunningham with one of the towns in the Malli country taken by Alexander. An ancient mound of brick ruins adjoins the present site. Tradition assigns the foundation of the modern town to Kh\u00e1n Kam\u00e1l, a Kharal chieftain, in the 14th century, from whom it derives its name, and whose descendants still occupy it. The town is an uninteresting place, with low and mean-looking houses. It is traversed by a single b\u00e1z\u00e1r from east to west. The streets are, as a rule, well paved, and though many of them are narrow and crooked, the drainage, and indeed the sanitary arrangements generally, are excellent.\n\nPopulation (1868) 5695; (1881) 7594, namely, Muhammadans, 4227; Hindus, 3295; Sikhs, 66; Jain, 1; 'others,' 5. Number of houses, 1021. Since the British annexation, a brisk trade in the produce of the R\u00e1vi lowlands has sprung up, and the importance of Kot Kam\u00e1li\u00e1 has been immensely increased by the opening of the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway. The town is now a place of considerable commerce, collecting wheat, grain, and pulses from the surrounding villages and Jhang; gur and sugar from J\u00e1landhar and Amritsar; wool from Jhang; piece-goods from Calcutta, Kar\u00e1chi, Amritsar, and M\u00falt\u00e1n; majith or madder and fruits from Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n. The exports consist of\nlungis, quilts, darris or cotton carpets, etc. In 1857, the insurgent tribes held the town for a week, and completely sacked it. Police station, post-office, schools; saraii, with accommodation for European travellers. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a3242; in 1881-82, \u00a3347, or an average of 1s. 5d. per head. The municipal income is chiefly derived from octroi.\n\n**Kot Kangra.**\u2014See Kangra (Town).\n\n**Kotkh\u00e1i Kotgarh** (correctly Kotguru).\u2014Tahsil of Simla District, Punjab.

Kotri has been placed in considerable danger, however, by sudden and violent inundations of the B\u00e1ran mountain torrent, to protect it from which a dam was erected some years since. A station on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway, which communicates with the seaport of Kar\u00e1chi (106 miles). By the river, here 600 yards wide, and from 9 to 10 feet deep in ordinary seasons, Kotri has regular communication with Sukkur (270 miles), Mith\u00e1nkot (430 miles), and Mult\u00e1n (570 miles). Besides the steamers, native vessels go up and down with merchandise. The river bank, crowded with flotilla steamers, barges, and small native craft, all discharging or collecting cargo, often presents an animated scene, not to be found at any other station nearer than Sukkur (Sakkar). Sidings convey goods from the railway to the river by zigzag routes, so constructed as to suit any condition of the stream, in flood or drought.\n\nHead-quarters station of Deputy Collector, Civil Surgeon, Conser-vator and Registrar of the Indus, and judge of subordinate civil court. Protestant and Roman Catholic churches. Civil hospital, court-house, subordinate jail, post-office, Government and other schools, and travellers\u2019 bungalow. The Indus Steam Flotilla formerly had its head-quarters at Kotri, with a large floating dock for the repairs of its steamers. Since the connection of the railway in the Indus valley with the general railway system of India, the Indus Steam Flotilla has been abolished, and its fleet of steamers sold. The European quarter, north and west of the native town, stands embosomed in foliage, handsome trees lining all its well-kept and neatly laid-out roads.\n\nLocal trade inconsiderable; large transit traffic between Kar\u00e1chi and the Punjab. The articles of merchandise sent upwards comprise beer, wine, and spirits for the European troops quartered in the Punjab; metals, railway materials, piece-goods, and silk. The return trade consists principally of wool, cotton, grain, oil-seeds, indigo, gh\u00ed, oil, saltpetre, and sugar. Water from Kotri is forwarded to Kar\u00e1chi, especially for the manufacture of ice and for drinking pur-\nposes.

The Krishnagar College, affiliated to the Calcutta University, was attended by 41 students in 1882-83; and its attached collegiate school by 209 pupils in the same year. Both college and collegiate school have shown a steadily decreasing number of pupils of late years, owing to the prevalence of malarious fever in the District. The town is a seat of considerable trade, and is noted for its manufacture of coloured clay figures, a speciality carried on by a few artists of the Kumbh\u00e1r or potter caste. Krishnagar is the residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Nadiy\u00e1, one of the old historical families of Bengal, for an account of whom see NADIYA DISTRICT.\n\nKrishnagiri (Kistnagiri).\u2014T\u00e1luk in Salem District, Madras Presidency.

Hindus numbered 115,163; Muhammadans, 5226; Christians, 514; and 'others,' 26. The area liable to revenue is distributed as follows:\u2014Government villages, 246,189 acres, and muta and shrotriem villages, 188,888 acres. The extent actually under cultivation in rayatw\u00e1ri villages is 95,869 acres, paying \u00a311,471. The staples of cultivation are r\u00e1gi on dry and paddy on wet lands; but other grain crops, as var\u00e1gu, cumbu, and cholam, are also largely grown. Irrigation is carried on from the Penn\u00e1r (Ponnaiy\u00e1r) and other small rivers, tanks (333), minor reservoirs (71), and wells (6262); irrigated area, 8499 acres, assessed at \u00a33816.

Lat. 12\u00b0 32' N., long. 78\u00b0 15' 40\" E.; containing, with Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d, 1665 houses and 8856 inhabitants, namely, 4183 males and 4673 females, of whom 22 per cent., or 1980, are Musalm\u00e1ns, chiefly Sepoys. Hindus number 6755; Christians, 114; and 'others,' 7. Situated on the Madras-Bangalore road, the head-quarters of the t\u00e1luk, and formerly the military key to the B\u00e1ramah\u00e1l. It consists of two portions, Old and New Krishnagiri, the latter also known as Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d. Both portions are clean, and well laid out in broad streets. To the north towers the durgam or fortified hill, rising almost perpendicularly 800 feet over the town. The fortifications are said to have been built by Jagadeva R\u00e1o, but most probably are due to Haidar \u00c1li and Tip\u00fa.\nSult\u00e1n. Dilapidated ramparts, reservoirs, and ruined barracks now alone mark the former purpose of the site. Such were its capabilities for defence, that it was never carried by assault. In 1767, and again in 1791, British troops attempted it unsuccessfully, and on several occasions during our operations against Mysore it was found necessary to blockade or mask it. In 1768 it surrendered to a blockading force, and was held by a British garrison for some years, until restored by treaty. In 1803, a powder explosion caused great loss of life, the magazine having been struck by lightning.\n\nKrishnai.\u2014River of Assam, which rises in the G\u00e1ro Hills to the north of the Arbel\u00e1 range, near the village of Mand\u00e1lang-giri, and, flowing north into Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra District, falls into the Brahmaputra a few miles above Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra town. Its tributaries in the hills are the Banji and Rangri. The principal place on the banks of the Krishnai is the market village of Jir\u00e1, where the river debouches upon the plains. In the hills the stream is only used for floating down timber and dug-out canoes, but in the plains it becomes navigable for boats of 2 tons burthen for a distance of 22 miles.\n\nKrishtna.\u2014District and river, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Kistna.\n\nKub\u00e1.\u2014Petty State in the Sorath division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, Bombay Presidency. It consists of 1 village, with 2 separate shareholders. Area, 1 square mile; population (1881) 375. The revenue is estimated at \u00a3300.\n\nKubatt\u00far.\u2014Village in Shimoga district, Mysore State; anciently called Kuntala-nagara. Associated by tradition with King Chandrah\u00e1sa of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, whose romantic story is told at greater length in the K\u00e1narese J\u00e1imini Bhar\u00e1ta. Ruins of temples in the Chalukyan style of architecture still exist.\n\nKuch Behar.\u2014Native State in political relation with the Government of Bengal. It is situated between $25^\\circ 57' 40''$ and $26^\\circ 32' 20''$ N. lat., and between $88^\\circ 47' 40''$ and $89^\\circ 54' 35''$ E. long., entirely surrounded by British territory, being bordered by the Western Dw\u00e1rs of Jalp\u00e1gur\u00ed on the north and by Rangpur District on the south. The area, including certain outlying and detached tracts in Rangpur and Jalp\u00e1gur\u00ed Districts, is 1307 square miles; and the population, according to the Census of 1881, numbers 602,624 persons. The administrative head-quarters and the principal residence of the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 are at Kuch Behar town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The State forms a level plain of triangular shape, intersected by numerous rivers. The greater portion is fertile and well cultivated, but tracts of jungle are to be seen in the north-east corner, which abuts upon the Province of Assam. The general green of the arable fields is only broken by bamboo clumps and orchards, which surround the homestead of each jotd\u00e1r or substantial farmer. The\nsoil is uniform in character throughout, consisting of a light, friable loam, varying in depth from 6 inches to 3 feet, superimposed upon a deep bed of sand. The whole is detritus, washed down by torrents from the neighbouring Him\u00e1layas.\n\nThe rivers all pass through the State from north to south, with a slight inclination towards the east, on their way from the mountains to join the main stream of the Brahmaputra. The following six are generally navigable for small trading boats throughout the year, and, with the exception of the T\u00edst\u00e1 and the R\u00e1idhak, are fordable at places during the dry season:\u2014The T\u00edst\u00e1, Singim\u00e1ri, Torsh\u00e1 or Dharia, K\u00e1lj\u00e1n\u00ed, R\u00e1idhak, and Gad\u00e1dhar. There are, besides, some twenty minor streams which become navigable only during the rainy season. The river beds are nowhere strongly defined. The streams have a tendency to cut new channels for themselves after every annual flood, and they communicate with one another by cross-country watercourses. These fluvial changes have scattered over the country many pools and marshes of stagnant water. There are no embankments or artificial canals, nor are any mineral products known to exist.\n\nHistory.\u2014As is the case with many of the Native States throughout India, the ruling family of Kuch Behar lays claim to a divine origin. There can be no doubt that this region contained the capital of the ancient Hindu kingdom of K\u00e1mrup, which was overthrown by the Afgh\u00e1n kings of Gaur towards the close of the 15th century. Local traditions of the national dynasty still live in the memories of the people, and the ruins of more than one of their capitals are pointed out at the present day. On their downfall, according to all accounts, succeeded a period of anarchy, during which the land was overrun by wild tribes from the north-east. Among these the Kochs came to the front, and ultimately founded the kingdom of Kuch Behar. The first rulers were evidently powerful princes, for their influence extended over the greater part of Assam and Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, and they were able to maintain a show of independence against the Mughal Naw\u00e1bs of Bengal. But when the British entered into relations with the State its power was at a very low ebb.\n\nThe generally received tradition makes one H\u00e1jo, of the Koch tribe, the earliest known founder of the dynasty; but according to a second legend, more popular at Court, the family trace back to a Mech called H\u00e1riy\u00e1. Both stories agree in introducing two women, H\u00edr\u00e1 and J\u00edra, who are variously described as sisters or as wives of a common husband. The part assigned to J\u00edra is unimportant; but the beauty of H\u00edr\u00e1 attracted the love of the great god Siva, by whom she became the mother of a son, Visu or Biswa Singh, the first king of Kuch Behar. All the members of the ruling family bear the name of N\u00e1riy\u00e1n or Lord. The common people, at least those who have not embraced Isl\u00e1m, call themselves by the high-sounding title of R\u00e1jbansi or 'royal-\nborn'; and the official appellation of the State is N\u00edj Behar, *N\u00edj* = 'own' or 'peculiar,' being used to distinguish the country from Behar proper.\n\nThe greatest monarch of the dynasty was Nar N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, the son of Visu Singh, who began to reign about 1550 A.D. He conquered the whole of K\u00e1mnr\u00fap, and built temples in Assam, of which ruins still exist bearing inscriptions with his name. He compelled the Deb R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bh\u00fat\u00e1n to pay tribute, and extended his power southwards over what is now part of the British Districts of Rangpur and Purniah. To this reign also is attributed the introduction of the well-known N\u00e1r\u00e1yan\u00ed currency, the privilege of coining which has not yet been entirely abolished, although the custom has fallen into disuse. Old N\u00e1r\u00e1yan\u00ed coins are not in general circulation, but are accepted at the treasury at a fixed rate. A few coins have been struck to celebrate the accession of recent R\u00e1j\u00e1s, but not for circulation. The privilege, when enjoyed, was much abused, and the existing N\u00e1r\u00e1yan\u00ed rupees are very bad silver.\n\nThe Koch kingdom did not long retain its independence. Nar N\u00e1r\u00e1yan divided his Assam possessions among his brothers, where their descendants are to be found at the present day as wealthy zamin-d\u00e1rs. His son, Lakshm\u00ed N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, who succeeded him in Kuch Behar, came into collision with the Mughal Empire, and was carried away prisoner to Delhi, whence he returned shorn of the attributes of sovereignty. The history of the State now loses all general interest. The Mughals closed round it from the south, though they never actually annexed it, as a revenue-paying unit, to the Province of Bengal. On the north, the Bhuti\u00e1s commenced a regular system of depredations, and went so far as to assert the right of interfering in the succession to the throne. The internal affairs of the State also fell into deplorable confusion. In accordance with the curse of the Hindu political system, three families, all scions of the royal stock,\u2014the R\u00e1ikat of B\u00e1ikanthpur, the N\u00e1zir Deo, and the D\u00edw\u00e1n Deo,\u2014each claimed a hereditary position which was inconsistent with unity of administration, and did not hesitate to call in the foreign foe to support their pretensions.\n\nIt was under these circumstances that the East India Company gained their first knowledge of Kuch Behar. In 1772, the N\u00e1zir Deo, having been driven out of the country by his rivals, who were aided by the Bhuti\u00e1s, applied for assistance to Warren Hastings, then Governor-General of Bengal. A detachment of Sepoys was accordingly marched into Kuch Behar; the Bhuti\u00e1s were expelled, after a sharp resistance, and forced to sue for peace through the intervention of the Lama of Tibet. The treaty made upon this occasion, bearing date April 1773, is the only authoritative document to determine the relations now existing between the two parties. By the third clause, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 acknowled-\nledged subjection to the Company, and consented to his country being annexed to the Province of Bengal. In subsequent clauses he promised to make over to the Company one-half of his annual revenue, according to an assessment to be settled by the Company. The precise amount of this moiety was not determined until 1780, when it was fixed by the Collector of Rangpur at Sikk\u00e1 Rs. 62,722, equivalent to Company's Rs. 67,700 (say \u00a36770), which sum has continued to be paid into the treasury of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 up to the present day. As to the important question of the amount of interference which the British might exercise in the internal administration, the treaty is entirely silent. No doubt it was hoped that things would now go on quietly; and even in subject zamind\u00e1ris at this time, the British were not inquisitive about misgovernment, provided that there were no outbreaks of violence, and the revenue was punctually paid. But though the Bhuti\u00e1s had been driven out, the rivalry of domestic faction continued unabated. Anarchy was rendered yet more intense by a long minority, and the worse evil of the regency of a R\u00e1n\u00ed. Conspiracies and murders repeatedly demanded the armed interference of the Collector of Rangpur. A commission of two civil servants was nominated in 1788 to inquire into the state of the country. In their report they are careful to point out that the R\u00e1j\u00e1 'had made only a partial and voluntary surrender of his rights, and maintained his independence unimpaired in his domestic administration.' They concluded by recommending the appointment of a Resident or Commissioner at the town of Kuch Behar. This office subsequently became merged in that of Governor-General's Agent for the North-east Frontier; and its occupant was usually too much engaged with the troublous affairs of Assam to pay any attention to Kuch Behar. The little State went on after its own fashion for many years, presenting a unique picture of the merits and demerits of native Bengali administration.\n\nIn 1863, the death of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, leaving a son and heir only ten months old, attracted the attention of the Government. It was resolved that a British Commissioner should undertake the direct management of affairs during the minority of the prince. No organic changes were effected beyond what was absolutely necessary; but an attempt has been made to give tone and vigour to the administration, by the example of administrative energy and judicial uprightness. Among the many reforms introduced, the following are the most noteworthy:\n\nA complete survey of the State, accompanied by a settlement of the land revenue and a record of all rights in the soil; the reorganization of the police, and the establishment of an education department; good carriage roads have been constructed, to connect the State with adjacent commercial centres; rivers have been bridged, plantations of valuable trees laid out, and an efficient system of postal and tele\ngraphic communication established. The young R\u00e1j\u00e1 received his early training under an able European officer at Patna, and subsequently attended law lectures for three years at the Presidency College, Calcutta. In 1878 he married a daughter of the late B\u00e1bu Keshab Chandra Sen, and in the same year he paid a visit to England. He attained his majority in October 1883, when he assumed the administration of the State. He has been appointed an honorary Major in the British Army, and is attached to the 6th Bengal Cavalry. The higher title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 has also been conferred upon him.\n\nPeople.\u2014The Census of 1872 returned a total population of 532,565 persons, residing in 1199 mauz\u00e1s or villages and in 81,820 houses. In 1881 the population was returned at 602,624, showing an increase of 70,059, or 13\u00b71 per cent., in the nine years. Area of State (1881), 1307 square miles, with 1214 villages, and 115,720 houses. Persons per square mile, 461; villages per square mile, 0\u00b793; houses per square mile, 91. The average number of persons per village is 496; of persons per house, 5\u00b721. Classified according to sex, there are 311,678 males and 290,946 females; proportion of males, 51\u00b74 per cent. Classified according to age, there are, under 15 years\u2014123,073 boys and 114,592 girls; total children, 237,665, or 39\u00b74 per cent. of the total population; above 15 years\u2014males 188,605, and females 176,354; total adults, 364,959, or 60\u00b76 per cent. of the population. The occupation returns are not trustworthy; but it may be mentioned that the total number of male adults connected with agriculture is returned at 125,559. Classified according to religion, Hindus number 427,478; Muhammadans, 174,539; Jains, 144; Christians, 48; and 'others,' 415.\n\nThe great bulk of the population is undoubtedly of mixed origin, in which the aboriginal element strongly predominates. The aborigines proper are poorly represented, and consist mainly of Morangs, G\u00e1ros, and Mechs. But the semi-Hinduized aborigines, with the addition of the Muhammadans, who are not ethnologically to be distinguished from them, form together upwards of 90 per cent. of the total population. The R\u00e1jbansi alone, the name by which the Koch tribe is known at the present day in its original head-quarters, number 299,458 souls, or 49\u00b77 per cent. of the whole. The Koch or R\u00e1jbansi is a widely spread tribe, evidently of aboriginal descent, which is found throughout all northern Bengal, from Purniah District to the Assam valley. In ethnical affinities, they are apparently connected with the Indo-Chinese races of the north-east frontier; but they have now become largely Hinduized, especially in their own home, where the appellation 'Koch' has come to be used as a term of reproach. They have adopted exclusive caste habits, and pride themselves upon their purity in eating and drinking. But it is charged against them that their\nnumbers are largely recruited by the offspring of mixed marriages and illicit connections. Of the Hindus proper, the Br\u0101hmans number 3530; the Kshattriyas or R\u00e1jputs, 3197; the K\u00e1yasths, 2522. The most numerous caste is that of the Tiors, a low semi-aboriginal caste of fishermen, menials, and swineherds, numbering 54,152. Next to these in numerical order are the Bagd\u00eds, 14,196; Chand\u00e1l\u015b, 5208; Jug\u00eds, 4431; Kurm\u00eds, 3586; N\u00e1pits, 3052; Kaibarttas, 2678; Jaliyas, 2640; and M\u00e1l\u00eds, 2156. There are a few members of the Br\u0101hma Sam\u00e1j, who have a regular place of meeting in Kuch Behar town. The Vaishnavs are returned at 1210. The Christian population comprises 32 Europeans, 3 Eurasians, 9 Native Christians, and 4 unspecified.\n\nKuch Behar town, which contains the palace of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and has 9535 inhabitants, is the only place worthy the name of a town in the State. Even villages, in the ordinary sense of the word, are unknown. Out of a total of 1214 mauz\u00e1s returned in the Census Report, as many as 827 have a population of less than 500 persons each. The people do not gather into hamlets of any sort, but each well-to-do family lives apart in its own homestead. Within the State are situated the extensive ruins of two ancient walled cities, known as Dharma P\u00e1l's city and Kamat\u00e1pur, capitals of the K\u00e1mrup monarchy before the rise of Kuch Behar.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Rice constitutes the staple crop throughout the State, being grown on about three-fourths of the total cultivated area. The \u00e1man or haimantik harvest, reaped in December and January, furnishes about 55 per cent. of the food-supply; the \u00e1us or bitari, about 21 per cent., the remainder being made up by millets, wheat, and various sorts of pulses. Jute and tobacco are largely grown for exportation, over an area that is increasing year by year. Manure, in the form of cow-dung, is used by the cultivators for special crops, the quantity being determined by the number of cattle they keep. Irrigation is rarely practised. Lands are occasionally allowed to lie fallow, but the principle of the rotation of crops is unknown. The average out-turn of an acre of rice land varies from 11 to 20 cwt., valued at from \u00a31, 11s. to \u00a32, 13s. The value of a second crop, if obtained from the same field, would be about \u00a31 additional. The rates paid by all classes of cultivators are practically fixed by the Government Settlement, which is to last for twelve years.\n\nThe R\u00e1j\u00e1 is the actual owner of the soil; and he deals directly only with the jotd\u00e1rs and chuk\u00e1nid\u00e1rs, substantial farmers, who frequently cultivate the land themselves, but also let it out to under-tenants. These again sub-let, and about half the area held by the jotd\u00e1rs and chuk\u00e1nid\u00e1rs is cultivated by adhi\u00e1rs, who have no interest in the soil, but receive a certain share of the produce.\nAccording to the Settlement now current, the jotd\u00e1r pays a rent of 3s. an acre, and is expressly prohibited from exacting an increase of more than 25 per cent. from his under-tenant, who in his turn is laid under similar restrictions with regard to the \u00e1dhi\u00e1r. At the same time, an effort has been made to improve the position of the \u00e1dhi\u00e1rs, by giving them some degree of fixity of tenure. It is reported that the cultivators of Kuch Behar are generally in a better position than men of the same class in the neighbouring Districts of Bengal.\n\nThe ordinary rates of wages appear to have trebled within the past thirty years. Both common labourers and skilled artisans require to be imported from the south. In 1850, a coolie received only 3s. a month; he now receives about 14s. In the same period, the wages of an agricultural labourer have risen from 4s. to 10s. a month; and those of a local artisan from 5s. to 16s. On the other hand, the price of food-grains would seem to have remained almost stationary. Common rice, which fetched 4s. 9d. per cwt. in 1861, is reported to have sold at 4s. 1d. per cwt. in 1870, the average price in 1883 being 5s. 6d. per cwt. The maximum price reached in 1866, the year of the Orissa famine, was 10s. 11d. per cwt.\n\nKuch Behar is not specially exposed to the calamities of either flood or drought. Heavy rain in the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Hills sometimes causes inundation. On two occasions in recent years, in 1854 and in 1873, the failure of the crops, due to insufficient local rainfall, has been so extensive as to require relief operations on the part of the authorities. In the latter year \u00a320,000 was expended on this account. These occurrences, however, are so rare that no system of irrigation works or embankments has ever been thought desirable; and the means of communication are now sufficiently ample to prevent local scarcity from intensifying into famine. If the price of rice were to rise in January to 8s. 2d. per cwt., that should be regarded as a sign of approaching distress.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The people make a great portion of their own cloth, mats, baskets, etc. within their own families. The only special industries are the weaving of a strong silk from worms fed on the castor-oil plant, and of a coarse jute cloth, used for screens and bedding. An artisans' school has recently been established at Kuch Behar town, and several skilled workmen have been engaged by the State to teach their trades.\n\nThe external trade of the State is annually on the increase. Its conduct is chiefly in the hands of M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri immigrants from the North-West. The system of registration at Sir\u00e1jganj unfortunately fails to record the entire river traffic of Kuch Behar. The returns for the year 1876\u201377 (the latest year for which full details are available) show a total export valued at \u00a3152,683, against imports valued at only\n\u00a355,837. The chief articles of export were jute (166,200 maunds), tobacco (159,300 maunds), oils (\u00a38833), timber (\u00a37281); the imports were almost entirely confined to salt (47,500 maunds), sugar (\u00a310,400), piece-goods (\u00a34420). The explanation of the disproportionately low figures of importation is to be found in the circumstance, that the supplies are mainly received from Sirajganj, whence they are reconsigned after having once passed the registration station. The principal marts are\u2014Chaora H\u00e1t, which exported 50,000 maunds of jute and 22,400 of tobacco, and received 6800 of salt; Kuch Behar town, which exported 15,400 maunds of jute and 34,200 of tobacco, and received 8500 of salt; Balrampur, which exported 47,300 maunds of jute and received 8100 of salt. The amount of jute exported has greatly increased of late, since the opening of the Northern Bengal State Railway, the Haldibari station of which is situated within the State, and is rapidly becoming an important centre of trade for jute and other country produce. The present (1883) export of jute probably approaches 400,000 maunds.\n\nA small but effective Public Works Department has been instituted within the last few years. In 1874 there were about 115 miles of unmetalled roads in the State, with numerous good wooden bridges; and \u2018thousands of carts are now found where only tens and scores used to be seen.\u2019 There are now (1883) 271 miles of road in the State, all of them bridged, excepting where they cross the larger rivers. The roads in the town of Kuch Behar and its vicinity are many of them metalled. The system of roads is mainly designed to bring all parts of the country into easy communication with the Tista and the Brahmaputra, the two water highways of this region; the total cost of maintenance is \u00a32000 to \u00a32500 per annum. A railway from Kuch Behar to join the branch line of the Northern Bengal Railway at Kauni in Rangpur District is projected, and the Haldibari station of the main line of that railway is just within the western limits of the State.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1870\u201371, the net revenue of Kuch Behar State amounted to \u00a3112,093, towards which the land-tax contributed \u00a340,896, and the zamindari estates in British territory \u00a325,719; the net expenditure was returned at \u00a3120,279, including \u00a313,903 for household expenses, \u00a310,430 for public works, and an aggregate of \u00a358,722 for \u2018land revenue\u2019 and zamindari. In 1881\u201382, the total revenue of the State from all sources (exclusive of the zamindaris within British territory) amounted to \u00a3132,040, of which the land-tax yielded \u00a396,486. The net expenditure during 1881\u201382 was \u00a3116,344, of which \u00a330,944 was for the Maharaja\u2019s household, \u00a332,365 for public works, and \u00a311,557 for Government tribute and land revenue. During the ten years from 1864, when a British Commissioner took charge of the administration on the death of the late Raj\u00e1 up to 1874, the total\nsurplus revenue amounted to \u00a3150,000. Most of it was invested in public securities.\n\nIn 1883 there were 8 criminal and 11 revenue and civil courts open. For police purposes, the State is divided into 6 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles. In 1881-82, the regular police force numbered 300 officers and men, maintained at a total cost of \u00a34215. These figures show 1 policeman to every 4.3 square miles of the area, or to every 2008 persons in the population; and an average cost of \u00a33, 4s. 6d. per square mile, and 1\u00bdd. per head of population. The system of village watch has been gradually introduced, and there are now 1701 chaukid\u00e1irs. The force has been in all respects assimilated to that of the surrounding villages. In 1874, 2674 criminal cases were instituted, in which 2614 persons were brought to trial, of whom 1748, or 66 per cent., were convicted, showing 1 person convicted of an offence to every 304 of the population. Out of property to the value of \u00a3770 reported to be stolen, \u00a3209, or 27 per cent., was recovered. There is one jail at Kuch Behar town. In 1874, the aggregate number of prisoners was 1324, of whom 34 were females; the average cost per head was \u00a34, 13s. 4d., and the net profit from jail manufactures amounted to \u00a3478.\n\nEducation has extended rapidly during recent years. In 1874 there were 245 schools, attended by 6495 pupils, showing 1 school to every 5.3 square miles, and 1 pupil to every 82 of the population. The high school, with 176 students, has won many scholarships in the colleges of Bengal. The artisan school, or technical institution for the lower classes, is attended by 39 pupils. There is a good library of English literature in Kuch Behar town, and also a State printing-press. An official Gazette called Cooch Behar State Gazette is published every fortnight at the State Press.\n\nThe administration of Kuch Behar State is carried on by the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1, assisted by a council, consisting of three members, namely, the Superintendent of the State, the Diw\u00e1n or chief revenue officer, and the Civil Judge. The Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 is the President of the Council, and in his absence the Superintendent of the State acts as Vice-President.\n\nThe Superintendent of the State supervises, directs, and controls the administration of criminal justice, and the police, military, jail, public works, education, and audit departments. He is also Sessions Judge, hearing all criminal appeals which ordinarily lie to Sessions Judges in British Districts.\n\nThe Diw\u00e1n is in charge of the revenue department, and is responsible for the collection of all kinds of revenue, and the supervision of all proceedings in connection therewith. He does not exercise any judicial powers. Appeals from the decisions of his subordinates in\nrent suits lie to the Civil Court; but he hears appeals from their orders in revenue executive matters, such as sales for arrears, mutation cases, etc.\n\nThe Judicial Member of Council hears all civil and revenue appeals in which the subject-matter of the suit exceeds Rs. 100 in value in Small Cause Court cases, and Rs. 50 in other cases. In addition, he tries original civil and rent suits, in which the value exceeds Rs. 500.\n\nThe following appeals lie to the Council\u2014(1) Appeals from sentences passed by the Sessions Court; (2) Civil appeals, both on the facts and on points of law, from the Judicial Member in original suits; (3) Special appeals on law points only, in other civil and revenue cases. Sentences of death are confirmed by the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 in Council in every case. The three Members of Council are independent of each other.\n\nThe officers subordinate to the Superintendent of the State are\u2014(1) The Faujd\u00e1ri Ahilk\u00e1r, or Magistrate, who exercises the powers of a first-class Magistrate in British Districts. He is assisted by subordinate Magistrates, who exercise second and third class powers; (2) The Superintendent of Education, who has under him a Deputy and a Sub-Deputy Superintendent; (3) The Superintendent of Police, with his staff of inspectors and sub-inspectors; (4) The Superintendent of Public Works, with a subordinate staff of assistant superintendents, overseers, and sub-overseers. The Diw\u00e1n, or chief revenue officer, is assisted by an officer styled M\u00e1l-kachh\u00e1ri Naib Ahilk\u00e1r, who has also the charge of the treasury. There are four administrative Sub-divisions in the State, each presided over by an officer styled Naib Ahilk\u00e1r, whose duties are analogous to those of sub-divisional officers in British Districts.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Kuch Behar is damp and malarious, but not so hot as in other parts of Bengal. The wind sets much from the east, and thunderstorms are common from March to May. The rainy season lasts from April to October. Fogs are common during the cold weather in the early mornings. The average annual rainfall is returned at 123 inches. During the year 1874, the highest temperature recorded at 10 A.M. was 92\u00b05' F., in the month of June; the lowest at 4 P.M. was 49\u00b01', in January.\n\nThe chief diseases are malarious fevers, dysentery, diarrhoea, splenitis, and goitre. Cholera appears to be endemic to the country, and occasionally breaks out with great epidemic violence. Small-pox is now disappearing before the introduction of vaccination. In 1876, the total number of patients treated at the charitable dispensary was 5075, the proportion of deaths to patients treated being 31 per thousand.\n\nKuch Behar.\u2014Capital of Kuch Behar State and the principal residence of the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1; situated on the Torsha river. Lat. 26\u00b019'36\" N., long. 89\u00b028'53\" E. Population (1872) 7145; (1881) 9535. Hindus\nnumbered in the latter year 6119; Muhammadans, 3337; and 'others,' 79. Area of town site, 1309 acres. The town until recently consisted of a congeries of mat huts surrounding the brick mansion which formed the residence of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1. Great improvements have, however, been effected within the last few years, and others have been introduced and energetically proceeded with since the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 assumed the direct management of the State on attaining his majority in 1883. The principal square has been surrounded on three sides with handsome public buildings. In the centre of the square is a large tank called the S\u00e1gard\u00edghi, which affords good drinking water to nearly all the population. On the north side of the square stands the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1's court-house and attached offices, a two-storied building of imposing appearance. On the east are the English and vernacular schools, printing-office, and State record rooms. To the south the subordinate civil and criminal courts occupy a fine building, containing four large court-rooms and other smaller offices. The old market-place has been recently cleared of mat huts, and a quadrangular marketplace with a corrugated iron roof and brick floor has been constructed. An excellent dispensary and hospital has also been built. The principal street passing through the b\u00e1z\u00e1r now contains hardly a single mat hut, and corrugated iron has taken the place of straw as roofing. The other public buildings are the post-office, jail, police station, and artisans' schools, located in suitable masonry buildings. A new palace, a splendid building, has just been constructed as a residence for the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 at a cost of about 12 l\u00e1khs of rupees (\u00a3120,000).\n\nThe trade is not large, and the few M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri merchants confine their dealings mainly to export traffic. The two small streams, both called Torsh\u00e1, which encircle the town on three sides, are navigable only during the rainy season. For the rest of the year, the sole means of communication is by land. The main line of road from Rangpur to Jalp\u00e1guri passes through the town. A municipality, consisting of official and non-official members, has lately been established.\n\n**Kuchla Bijn\u00e1.**\u2014Town in Hardoi District, Oudh; situated on the right bank of the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 river, 4 miles above its confluence with the Ganges. Population (1869) 2104; (1881) 1612, chiefly Raikw\u00e1rs, who obtained the village by conquest from the Thatheras.\n\n**K\u00fachmala.**\u2014Hill in Palgh\u00e1t t\u012bluk, Malabar District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 10\u00b0 33' N., long. 76\u00b0 55' E.; about 4000 feet above sea-level. A well-defined, pinnacle-shaped peak, terminating the Kollangod range. Contains some splendid teak. Inhabited by the hill tribe of Kurders.\n\n**Kudal\u00far.**\u2014T\u012bluk and town in South Arcot District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Cuddalore.\nKudal\u00far.\u2014Pass in Travancore State, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Gudalur.\n\nKudarimukh.\u2014Mountain in the Western Gh\u00e1ts, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Kuduremukha.\n\nKudarkot.\u2014Village and ruins in Bidhauna tahsil, Et\u00e1wah District, North-Western Provinces. Lies on the Et\u00e1wah and Kanauj road, 24 miles north-east of Et\u00e1wah town. Population (1872) 2567; (1881) 3459, namely, Hindus 2709, and Muhammadans 750. Probably a place of great importance in the days of the Gupta kings. Tradition asserts that an underground passage connected Kudarkot with Kanauj. The houses of the modern village are built of bricks dug out of the ancient mound. Miy\u00e1n Alm\u00e1s Ali Kh\u00e1n, minister of Naw\u00e1b Asaf ud-daul\u00e1, held court at Kudarkot, and built a fort with 16 bastions on the site of the prehistoric stronghold. Disused after the British occupation, it now serves in part for the factory of an indigo planter, in part for a police station and village school. An inscription of the 11th century has been found among the ruins.\n\nKudd\u00e1na.\u2014State in Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha Province, Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency. The chief is Th\u00e1kur Parvat Singhj\u00ed, born about 1822. The area of the State is 130 square miles. The revenue is estimated at \u00a31400. The State pays no tribute.\n\nKuditini.\u2014Town in Bellary District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 3944; number of houses, 768. The first stage on the Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r road, and formerly sacred as the halting-place of Komaras-w\u00e1mi on his expedition against the R\u00e1kshasas. Remains of a fort and of a Jain settlement.\n\nKudligi.\u2014T\u00e1luk in Bellary District, Madras Presidency. Area, 838 square miles (536,595 acres). Population (1881) 74,690, namely, 37,226 males and 37,464 females, inhabiting 15,086 houses. Hindus number 72,469; Muhammadans, 2181; Christians, 6; \u2018others,\u2019 34. The area under actual cultivation in 1871 was 124,428 acres. Three-quarters of the t\u00e1luk are waste. There are 70 miles of made road. Chief towns are Kudligi (2977), Kott\u00far (5156), and Jerimala. The t\u00e1luk contains 2 criminal courts and 9 police stations; regular police, 63 men. Land revenue, \u00a39046.\n\nKuduremukha (literally \u2018Horse-face\u2019).\u2014Peak of the Western Gh\u00e1ts, on the boundary between Kad\u00far District, Mysore State, and the Madras District of South K\u00e1nara. Lat. 13\u00b0 8' N., long. 75\u00b0 20' E.; 6215 feet above sea-level. The name is said to be derived from its appearance as a conspicuous landmark to sailors. It can be ascended from the west by a bridle-path. On the summit a bungalow has been erected as a summer retreat for the Malabar officials, and another has recently been built by the missionaries of the Basel Evangelical Mission.\n\nKuhan.\u2014River in the Punjab.\u2014See Kahan.\nKuhlur.\u2014State in the Punjab.\u2014See Kahlur.\n\nKukdel.\u2014Town in the Sh\u00e1h\u00e1da Sub-division of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency, included within the municipal limits of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1da (q.v.) town. The population of Kukdel itself in 1881 was 1217; the houses numbered 202.\n\nK\u00faki.\u2014A family of wild tribes inhabiting hilly country on the north-east frontier of India, extending along the southern border of the Assam District of Cachar, the eastern borders of the Bengal District of Chittagong, the hilly tracts of Northern Arakan, and stretching away into the unexplored mountains of Independent Burma.\u2014See Lushai Hills.\n\nKukra Mail\u00e1ni.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Lakhimpur tahsil, Kheri District, Oudh; lying between the Kathna river on the west and the Ul on the east; bounded on the north by Bh\u00far, and on the south by Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d pargan\u00e1s. A jungle tract, containing three large clearings\u2014one to the south, Saukhia Sans\u00e1rpur; one to the north-east, Kukra; and a third to the extreme north-west, Mail\u00e1ni. Most of the forest or upland area, amounting to 126 square miles, was made over to grantees under the lease rules, but they all failed to comply with the conditions of their grants, which have since been resumed and transferred to the Oudh Forest Department. The revenue-paying tract, 51 square miles, consists mainly of the basins of three or four ancient lakes, into which the high lands drained.\n\nThe aspect of these mere pits in the surface of the forest is very peculiar. The largest (Kukra) may be taken as a type of all: a flat plain about seven miles long and four broad, covered with rice-fields and prairies of long coarse grass, through which breast-high the foot-passenger moves with difficulty in pursuit of the game which lies concealed in herds. A few mango groves adjoin the mud-walled villages. Here and there a slight depression allows the rain-water to gather in stagnant marshes. All round the horizon the traveller sees the high bluffs\u2014once the shores of this inland sea\u2014rising crowned with a ring of lofty and dense s\u00e1l forest. This wall of verdure is only broken at places where it has been levelled to make room for the roads which pass through the plain, piercing the forest towards Gola and Bhira.\n\nRice is the principal crop in these clearings, but barley and gram have been sown largely of late years. The want of means of carriage alone prevents a large trade springing up in timber. Population (1868) 12,236; (1881) 14,641, of whom 2511 are Muhammadans, principally Path\u00e1ns; 12,125 Hindus; and 5 \u2018others.\u2019 Land revenue, \u00a3945. The proprietary body was formerly Ahban, but many of them have now lost all their possessions. Ahban Musalm\u00e1ns, however, still hold 19 of the 40 townships comprising the pargan\u00e1, 13 being held by R\u00e1jputs.\n\nKul\u00e1chi.\u2014Western tahsil of Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n District, Punjab;\nconsisting of the wild country immediately below the independent Sulaim\u00e1n mountains, stretching in its extreme southern portion to the west bank of the Indus. Lat. $30^\\circ 57' 30''$ to $32^\\circ 16' N.$, and long. $70^\\circ 14'$ to $70^\\circ 45'$ E. Area, 1513 square miles, with 111 towns and villages, and 14,172 houses. Population (1881) 70,950, namely, males 37,763, and females 33,187; average density of population, 47 persons per square mile. Number of families, 15,942. Classified according to religion, Muhammadans numbered 62,614; Hindus, 8170; and Sikhs, 166. Of the total area of 1513 square miles or 968,400 acres, 238,618 acres were returned as under cultivation in 1878-79, in the last quinquennial agricultural statistics of the Punjab Government. The uncultivated area comprised 8771 acres of grazing land, 588,159 acres of cultivable waste, and 132,852 acres of uncultivable waste. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a34673. The administrative staff consists of a tahsildar, a munsif, and an honorary magistrate. These officers preside over 3 civil and 2 criminal courts. The tahsil contains 3 tahsils or police circles, a regular police of 77 men, and a village watch of 122 chaukidars.\n\nKul\u00e1chi.\u2014Chieftown and head-quarters of Kul\u00e1chi tahsil, Dera Ismail Kh\u00e1n District, Punjab. Situated in lat. $31^\\circ 55' 38'' N.$, long. $70^\\circ 30' 19'' E.$, on the left bank of the Lun\u00ed, 27 miles north-west of Dera Ismail Kh\u00e1n town, and 24 miles south of Tank. Population (1868) 9921; (1881) 7834, namely, 2461 Hindus, 5310 Muhammadans, and 63 Sikhs; number of houses, 1336. Kul\u00e1chi is rather an aggregation of 16 separate hamlets standing at the point of union in their lands, than a regular town. Surrounded by a low mud wall; scattered houses, 30 mosques, 5 dharmas\u00e1las. Formerly carried on a brisk trade with the Waziris of the hills, which declined before annexation, but has since somewhat revived. Transit trade to Ghwal\u00e1ri Pass. Tahsil, police station, dispensary, school, travellers\u2019 bungalow. A third class municipality, with an income in 1880-81 of \u00a3536; expenditure, \u00a3551.\n\nK\u00fa-la-dan.\u2014River of Arakan, British Burma. Supposed to rise in the neighbourhood of the Blue Mountain, a peak in the Yoma range. After a course generally north and south, it falls into the Bay of Bengal at Akyab town, where it is called by Europeans the \u2018Arakan river,\u2019 but by the inhabitants of the country \u2018Gat-sa-ba.\u2019 Before the K\u00fa-la-dan leaves the hills, it is fed by numerous tributaries, the two largest being the M\u00ed from the east and the P\u00ed from the west; its banks are inhabited by hillmen. It is navigable by vessels of from 300 to 400 tons burden for nearly 50 miles. Its mouth forms a large harbour with good holding ground, protected from the south-west monsoon by the Borongo islands. On Savage Island, at the entrance to the harbour, stands a lighthouse, erected in 1842. The entrance is dangerous and difficult at low tide,\nthere being then a depth of barely $3\\frac{1}{2}$ fathoms, much reduced when a rolling swell sets in.\n\n**K\u00fa-la-dan.**\u2014Township in the north of Akyab District, Arakan Division, British Burma. It adjoins the Hill Tracts, and is divided into 13 revenue circles. Except to the south, the country is hilly, forest-clad, and but little cultivated. The township contains 294 villages. The area under cultivation (1881\u201382) is 40,880 acres, mostly under rice. Agricultural stock:\u2014Horned cattle, 25,768; pigs, 2550; goats, 805; ploughs, 5901; carts, 1237; and boats, 1095. The head-quarters of the township are on the right bank of the K\u00fa-la-dan river, near the Mah\u00e1-m\u00fani temple. Population (1881) 38,896; gross revenue, \u00a311,979; of which land revenue contributed \u00a37716, capitation-tax \u00a33488, and local cess \u00a3738.\n\n**Kulagh\u00e1t.**\u2014Village and head-quarters of a police circle in Rangpur District, Bengal; situated on the right bank of the Dharla river. An important trading mart; principal articles of export\u2014jute, tobacco, and ginger.\n\n**Kulasekharapatnam.**\u2014Town and seaport in Tenkar\u00e1i t\u00e1luk, Tinn\u00e9velli District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 9\u00b0 4' 40\" N., long. 77\u00b0 31' 20\" E. Population (1881) 14,972, namely, 6548 males and 8424 females; number of houses, 3823. Hindus numbered 7182; Muhammadans, 3572; Christians, 4218. One of the trade centres of the District. Imports (1880\u201381), \u00a316,828; exports, \u00a355,030.\n\n**Kulbarga** (or **Gulbarga**).\u2014Chief town of the Kulbarga District of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d State (Nizam\u2019s Dominions); situated on an undulating plain, which presents a somewhat dreary expanse of black soil. Population (1881) 22,834. The former capital of a powerful dynasty, it has now become a place of secondary importance. In early times it was a Hindu city of great extent. Previous to the Muhamma-dan conquest, Kulbarga was included in the dominions of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Warangal. After the subjugation of the Zadav\u00e1s of Deogiri (Daulat-\u00e1b\u00e1d) by the Muhammadans, other inroads followed which resulted in the overthrow of the Hindu kingdom of Warangal. In 1323, Prince Alagh Kh\u00e1n (afterwards the emperor Muhammad Tughlak), who was deputed by his father, Gh\u00e1zi Beg Tughlak, to suppress a rebellion that had broken out in the southern portions of the kingdom, captured Kulbarga and B\u00edd\u00e1r. Twenty years afterwards the Deccan governors rebelled against the emperor Muhammad Tughlak, and set up a king of their own. Malik Magh, the nominee of the rebels, abdi-cated in favour of Jafar Kh\u00e1n, who assumed the title of Ala-ud-din Hasan Sh\u00e1h Gangu B\u00e1hmani. He selected Kulbarga as his capital, and commenced to reign in 1347. The new king rapidly extended his dominions, which were subsequently divided into four great provinces. In 1432, the capital was transferred to B\u00edd\u00e1r. Towards\nthe close of the fifteenth century, Kulbarga came into the possession of the kings of Bij\u00e1pur.\n\nDuring the last ten or twelve years much has been done to restore to Kulbarga some of its former prosperity. The southeastern extension of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway has a station near the town. Between the railway station and the old town, plantations of trees have been laid out. A handsome garden and many new buildings also adorn the town. Kulbarga is entered by a stately gateway recently erected. In the jail the manufacture of carpets, both of the finer and coarser kinds, of soda-water and lemonade, of tents, and of paper, together with cloth-weaving, is carried on by 400 convicts.\n\nAfter the abandonment of Kulbarga for Bidar, the palaces and mosques, which had been erected by the kings who ruled there, were allowed to fall into ruin and decay. The outer walls and gateways of the old fort are now in a dilapidated condition. A citadel, or B\u00e1li Hiss\u00e1r, has suffered the least. The only remarkable building in the fort is the great mosque or masjid, modelled after the mosque of Cordova in Spain. Its chief peculiarity is that, alone among the larger mosques of India, the whole area of 38,016 square feet is covered in. Nothing but heaps of ruin remain of the palaces and pleasure-houses of the B\u00e1hmani kings.\n\n**Kulik.**\u2014River of Din\u00e1jpur District, Bengal. The principal tributary of the N\u00e1gar. It takes its rise in a marsh in the police circle (th\u00e1nd) of Th\u00e1kurg\u00e1on, and, after running for 36 miles through the th\u00e1nds of R\u00e1n\u00edsank\u00e1il, Pirganj, and Hemt\u00e1b\u00e1d, falls into the N\u00e1gar in lat. 25\u00b0 34' N., and long. 88\u00b0 5' E., at Gor\u00e1h\u00e1r village, near the point where the latter river joins the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1. The important jute mart of RAIGANJ is situated on the Kulik.\n\n**Kulital\u00e1i.**\u2014T\u00e1luk in Trichinopoli District, Madras Presidency. Area, 941 square miles. Population (1881) 201,990, namely, 97,382 males and 104,608 females. Number of villages, 249; houses, 41,666. Hindus number 187,180; Muhammadans, 6513; Christians, 8295; 'others,' 2. Villages of considerable size are\u2014Nangavaram (4465), Mah\u00e1danapuram (6191), and Kristnar\u00e1yapuram (3233). The t\u00e1luk contains 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; police stations (th\u00e1nds), 12; regular police, 86 men. Land revenue (1883), \u00a322,726.\n\n**Kulital\u00e1i.**\u2014Town in Kulital\u00e1i t\u00e1luk, Trichinopoli District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 10\u00b0 56' N., long. 78\u00b0 27' E.; situated on the banks of the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery). Population (1881) 1459; number of houses, 296. Head-quarters of the t\u00e1luk, and a station on the Erode branch of the South Indian Railway.\n\n**K\u00fall\u00e1r.**\u2014Village in Nilgiri Hills District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 11\u00b0 20' N., long. 70\u00b0 56' E. Although it belongs to Nilgiri District, K\u00fall\u00e1r lies low, being the d\u00e1k (post) station (5 miles from the railway\nterminus at Mettapolliem), where the ascent of the Kun\u00far (Coonoor) gh\u00e1t begins.\n\n**Kullu.\u2014Valley and Sub-division of Kangra District, Punjab. See Kulu.**\n\n**Kulpah\u00e1r** (also called Panw\u00e1ri-J\u00e1itpur, from the name of the two parg\u00e1ns comprising it).\u2014Southern tahsil of Ham\u00edrpur District, North-Western Provinces, consisting of part of the hilly and rocky southern border of the District. Area, 558 square miles, of which 309 are cultivated. Population (1872) 123,911; (1881) 125,578, namely, males 64,468, and females 61,110. Total increase of population in the 9 years, 1667, or 1.3 per cent. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 119,931, and Muhammadans, 5647. Of the 233 villages constituting the tahsil, 153 contained less than five hundred inhabitants. Land revenue, \u00a317,852; total Government revenue, \u00a321,110; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a332,671; incidence of Government revenue, 1s. per acre.\n\n**Kulpah\u00e1r.\u2014Town in Ham\u00edrpur District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Kulpah\u00e1r tahsil; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 19' 10\" N., and long. 79\u00b0 39' 40\" E., in the southern hill country; distant from Ham\u00edrpur town 60 miles south. Population (1872) 6044; (1881) 6066, namely, 5294 Hindus and 772 Muhammadans. Founded by Jagatr\u00e1j\u00e1, son of the great Bundela leader, Chhatar S\u00e1l, and R\u00e1j\u00e1 of J\u00e1itpur. Each of Jagatr\u00e1j\u00e1's sons built himself a mansion in the town, the ruins of which still exist. Kesri Singh also erected the Toriya fort, whose remains still stand. Large tanks, built by the Bundela R\u00e1j\u00e1s. Tahs\u00edli, police station, school, sar\u00e1i, unpretentious mosques and temples. Trade in grain, cotton, and the al dye. A specially good variety of cotton is grown in, and named from, the locality. The town was a centre of local disaffection during the Mutiny.**\n\n**Kulsi.\u2014River of Assam, formed by the junction of the Khri and Um-gin streams in the Kh\u00e1si Hills. The united stream flows north into K\u00e1m\u00edrup District, and, after a very winding course, which changes year by year, finally falls into the Brahmaputra, in lat. 26\u00b0 9' N., and long. 91\u00b0 22' E., near the Nagarbera hill on the south bank of that river. In the plains it is navigable by native boats during the greater part of the year. On its banks in K\u00e1m\u00edrup District are several valuable forests of s\u00e1l trees, under the protection of the Forest Department. The timber depot is at Kukurm\u00e1r\u00e1, at the crossing of the trunk road. A portion of the river is leased annually as a fishery.**\n\n**Kulsi.\u2014Forest reserve and experimental plantation in K\u00e1m\u00edrup District, Assam; on the right or west bank of the river of the same name, immediately north of the Bardw\u00e1r reserve. Area, 3520 acres, or 5.5 square miles. The surface soil is a sandy loam covered with vegetable mould, resting upon granitoid rock, much decomposed.**\nThere are several marshy tracts, inundated during the rains. About 2 square miles are covered with sal (Shorea robusta), which it is intended to preserve. The remainder is being gradually planted experimentally with teak (Tectona grandis), sissu (Dalbergia Sissoo), t\u00fan (Cedrela Toona), nahor (Mesua ferrea), sum (Machilus odoratissima); and all the land not suitable for timber trees is to be planted with caoutchouc or india-rubber (Ficus elastica). At the close of the year 1882, 168 acres had been planted with teak, 20 acres with sissu, 101 acres with caoutchouc, and 2 acres with bamboo.\n\nKulsia.\u2014Native State, Punjab.\u2014See Kalsia.\n\nK\u00falu.\u2014Eastern tahsil or Sub-division of Kangra District, Punjab. Lat. 31\u00b0 20' to 33\u00b0 N., and long. 76\u00b0 49' to 78\u00b0 35' E.; comprises the three taluks or cantons of Kulu, Lahul, and Spiti, each of which see separately. Area of the Sub-division, 6,344 square miles, of which only 67 square miles were returned as under cultivation in 1878. Population (1881) 108,981, namely, males 54,546, and females 54,435, living in 67 villages, and occupying 20,576 houses. Number of families, 22,342. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 105,493; Buddhists, 2860; Muhammadans, 547; Christians, 74; and Sikhs, 7. The average density of the population throughout the whole Sub-division is 17 persons per square mile, varying from 1 person per square mile in Spiti to 3 in Lahul, and to 52 in Kulu taluk. Nearly the whole of what little cultivation there is, is confined to Kulu Proper. The Assistant Commissioner of Kulu has his head-quarters at Nagar on the Beas (Bi\u00e1s). The subordinate officials include\u2014the tahsild\u00e1r of Kulu, whose head-quarters are at Sult\u00e1npur; the m\u0101st tahsild\u00e1r of Seor\u00e1j, whose head-quarters are at Pl\u00e1ch; the negi, or head-man of Lahul; and the nono of Spiti. These officers preside over 3 civil and 3 criminal courts; strength of regular police, 20 men, with 33 village watchmen or chaukid\u00e1rs. Revenue of the Sub-division, \u00a35598. For further information, see the following article, Kulu valley, and also Kangra District.\n\nKulu.\u2014A valley and taluk of Kangra District, Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 20' and 32\u00b0 26' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 58' 30\" and 77\u00b0 49' 45\" E. long. Bounded on the north-east and east by the Central Himalayan range, dividing it from Lahul and Spiti; on the south by the river Sutlej (Satlaj); on the south-west by the Dh\u00e1oladhar or Outer Himalayan range, the river Beas (Bi\u00e1s) and the Native States of Suket and Mandi; and on the west by the Bar\u00e1 Bang\u00e1hal Hills, which separate Kulu from the Bang\u00e1hal valley. Area, 1934 square miles; population (1881) 108,981 persons.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The river Sainj, which rises in the Mid-Himalayan range, joining the Beas (Bi\u00e1s) at L\u00e1rgi, divides the tract into two portions, Kulu Proper and Seor\u00e1j. The latter division, lying between\nthe Sainj and the Sutlej (Satlaj), is again separated into Outer and Inner Seor\u00e1j by the Jalorior Suket range. Kulu Proper, to the north of the Sainj, together with Inner Seor\u00e1j, forms a great basin or depression in the midst of the Him\u00e1layan systems, having the narrow gorge of the Beas at L\u00e1rji as the only outlet for its waters. North and east, the Bar\u00e1 Bang\u00e1hal and Mid-Him\u00e1layan ranges rise to a mean elevation of 18,000 feet; while southward, the Jalori and Dh\u00e1oladhar ridges attain the height of 11,000 feet. Within the basin thus defined, short but lofty buttresses of rock encroach upon the central area, leaving only a few rare patches of cultivable land between their barren and snow-clad summits. The greater portion must consequently ever remain an utter wilderness. The higher villages stand 9000 feet above the sea; and even the cultivated tracts have probably an average elevation of 5000 feet.\n\nThe Beas (Bi\u00e1s), which, with its tributaries, drains the entire basin, rises at the crest of the Rohtang Pass, 13,326 feet above the sea, and has an average fall of 125 feet per mile, although in the lower part of its course through K\u00falu, its average fall does not probably exceed 62 feet per mile. The principal tributaries of the Beas are on the right bank, the Solang or Beash-khand, the Man\u00e1li and the Sarwari; on the left bank the Raini, the Parbati (with its affluent the Mal\u00e1na), the Hural, the Sainj or L\u00e1rji, and the Tirthan. The Beas is bridged by a steel rope suspension bridge at Shamsi, and by wooden bridges at five other places. Its course presents a succession of magnificent scenery, including cataracts, gorges, precipitous cliffs, and mountains clad with forests of pine, towering above the tiers of deod\u00e1r on the lower rocky ledges.\n\nThe general appearance of the country is very different from that of K\u00e1ngra Proper. There are no low hills; at every point, before and behind, high mountains rise up at no great distance, and shut in the view. The lower slopes are dotted here and there with villages, not the scattered houses so common in K\u00e1ngra, but groups of houses standing as close together as the ground will admit. Some are tower-shaped, four storeys high, with but one room to each storey. The sloping roof of stone or wooden slabs with far projecting eaves, and the wooden verandahs thrown out round the upper storey, and adorned with carved work, have a very picturesque appearance. The lower storey is occupied by the cattle and sheep and goats; and consequently, instead of the fresh-plastered walls and clean-swept court-yards to be seen in the low hills, there is as much mud and mess round the houses as in a farm-yard in England. Round the villages are terraced fields, planted here and there with walnut and apricot trees, and fringed with belts of kh\u00e1rs\u00fa or mor\u00fa, evergreen oaks whose leaves are used for winter fodder; mixed up with the fields, and separating them from those of the next village,\nare slopes of steep grass and strips of *kail* pine and *deodar* cedar forest.\n\nAbove the villages, wherever there is some soil and not too much sun, dark forests of *reh* and *tos* pines, lit up here and there with patches of maple or horse chestnut, spread along the upper slopes, and are succeeded again by straggling woods of stunted oak, birch, and white rhododendron. Rounded grassy summits or bare ridges of rock crown the whole; and here and there, up a valley, or through an opening in the mountains, a glimpse is caught of the peaks and perpetual snows of the great ranges of which the mountains on which the villages stand are spurs and offshoots. This is the summer aspect of the country; in the winter the ground is covered with snow for two or three days, or for months together, according to situation. Snow does not usually lie long at heights of less than 6000 feet.\n\nIn the valley of the Beas the mountains stand back on either side for a distance of one or two miles; and fine plateaux run down with a gentle slope from their bases to the banks of the river. These plateaux are the garden of K\u00falu. They are closely and carefully cultivated, and watered by canals brought from the mountain gorges. The river banks are high cliffs hung with bush and creeper. Between them the river winds from side to side, now deep and smooth, now foaming down rocky rapids in channels fringed with alder, and through meadows and marshes dotted with ash and poplar. Here and there wooded islands break the stream into several branches. This part of the country is remarkably beautiful, and has gained for the K\u00falu valley the reputation of being the prettiest part of the British Himalayas. The minor rivers have no proper valley; the mountains rise abruptly from the very edge of the water.\n\nGreat mineral wealth exists in K\u00falu, undeveloped as yet, among the isolated glens, but the isolation of the country and the difficulty of transport and labour must for long prevent its proper development. In the tract known as Waz\u00edr\u00ed R\u00fapi, veins of silver, copper, and lead have been discovered, and in 1869 a monopoly of working the mines in this tract was granted to an English private gentleman. His proceedings, however, were not attended with any marked success, and the lease was cancelled in 1883. Negotiations with other English capitalists for a fresh lease are now (1884) in progress. In the valley of the upper Beas, various lodes have been discovered; and traces of a very pure white crystal, and of antimony, have been met with at Jagat Sukh on the Beas. Slate of a very fair quality is obtainable throughout Kulu, the better descriptions being found at Sult\u00e1npur. Several hot springs exist, much resorted to as places of pilgrimage, and for bathing purposes by persons suffering from rheumatism and skin diseases. The best\nknown of these springs are at M\u00e1nikarn in the valley of the P\u00e1rbat\u00ed, and at B\u00e1sisht and Kal\u00e1t on the banks of the Beas.\n\nForests occupy a considerable portion of K\u00falu below the snow line. The finest deod\u00e1r forests are those of the upper Beas and the P\u00e1rbat\u00ed, where they lie low in the valley near the water's edge. Higher up on the hill-side the forests are more dense, the principal timber trees being the reh or rai (Abies Smithiana), the tos (Abies Webbiana), and several kinds of oak. Horse chestnut, maple, birch, yew, walnut, and rhododendron are also very common. In the valleys, Him\u00e1layan poplar and alder are found. Walnut, apricot, and quince trees are much planted in fields surrounding the villages.\n\nThe fauna of K\u00falu is rich, and includes two species of bear, the black and brown; and two species of leopard, the common spotted and the white. Ibex and musk deer are found in the hills. The other animals include the hy\u00e6na, wild hog, jackal, fox, marten, wild cat, and flying squirrel. Several species of hill pheasant abound, but the mundil and argus pheasants, so prized for their plumage, are only procurable in the highest ranges. The white-crested pheasant, the koklas, and the chir, with red jungle-fowl, black and wood partridge, and chikor are common in the lower hills; snipe, woodcock, teal, and quail are tolerably abundant in the lower grass ground. In winter, the gohind or snow pheasant, and the snow partridge, can be obtained without difficulty, as also wild geese and duck. Eagles, vultures, kites, and hawks inhabit the upper fastnesses.\n\nHistory.\u2014The little principality of K\u00falu formed one of the eleven original R\u00e1jput States between the R\u00e1vi and the Sutlej, and probably belonged to some of the minor Katoch dynasties, offshoots from the great kingdom of Jal\u00e1ndhar (Jullundur). Hiuen Tsiang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, visited it in the 7th century; and local legends preserve the names of 87 princes who ruled successively in this remote mountain valley. Authentic history, however, first recognises K\u00falu in the 15th century, when R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sudh Singh ascended the throne, whom tradition places 74th in descent from the original founder of the dynasty. His descendants ruled the valley till the beginning of the present century, their annals being wholly confined to the usual Indian record of court intrigues, assassinations, and dynastic quarrels. When the G\u00farkhas broke out from their home in Nep\u00e1l, and conquered all the country up to the banks of the Sutlej, they found Bikr\u00e1ma Singh upon the throne of K\u00falu. Like the other neighbouring chieftains, Bikr\u00e1ma Singh paid tribute to the invaders for his cis-Sutlej territory, as well as to Sans\u00e1r Chand, the Katoch prince of Kangra, for K\u00falu itself. In 1809, however, Ranj\u00edt Singh, called in by Sans\u00e1r Chand, made himself master of the hills, and obtained tribute from the young R\u00e1j\u00e1 of K\u00falu, Aj\u00edt Singh, an illegitimate son of Bikr\u00e1ma Singh.\nThree years later, the Sikhs demanded an annual payment of \u00a35000; and on the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s refusal, marched upon his capital of Sult\u00e1npur and sacked his palace. Ajit Singh at length bribed the Sikhs to withdraw, by paying them all the money he could collect. After the expulsion of the G\u00farkhas, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 became a feudatory of the British for the cis-Sutlej tract. In 1839, General Ventura led a Sikh force against the neighbouring State of Mandi; after conquering which, one of his lieutenants attacked K\u00falu, on the pretext of hostile dispositions. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 made no resistance, and allowed himself to be taken prisoner; but the brutal discourtesy shown him by his captors roused the hereditary loyalty of the hillmen. A secret muster took place; and as the invaders marched out of Seor\u00e1j by the Basleo Pass, the hillmen fell upon them in a narrow ravine, rescued their prince, and massacred the Sikhs almost to a man.\n\nAjit Singh retired across the Sutlej to his fief of Sh\u00e1ngri, which he held from the British Government since the expulsion of the G\u00farkhas; and so placed himself beyond reach of vengeance from Lahore. A Sikh army soon after marched into Seor\u00e1j, but found it completely deserted, the inhabitants having fled into inaccessible forests on the mountain-sides. Accordingly they handed over the country in farm to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Mandi, leaving a garrison in K\u00falu to enforce their supremacy. Ajit Singh died at Sh\u00e1ngri in 1841; and the Sikhs made over in part their portion of his former dominions to his first cousin, Th\u00e1kur Singh, while Sh\u00e1ngri remained in the hands of another relative. In 1846, at the close of the first Sikh war, the Jalandhar (Jullundur) Do\u00e1b, with the adjoining hill States, passed into the power of the British; and K\u00falu, with L\u00e1hul and Spiti, became a tahsil of the new Kangra District. The Government confirmed Th\u00e1kur Singh in his title of R\u00e1j\u00e1, and in the territories which he then possessed. On his death in 1852, his son, Gy\u00e1n Singh, of doubtful legitimacy, obtained the inferior title of R\u00e1i, with half the land, and no political powers. The resumed half has since been restored, with certain reservations in favour of Government.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1881 returned the number of inhabitants at 100,259, spread over an area of 1934 square miles, distributed among 48 villages. The people are almost exclusively Hindus in religion, the ancient faith numbering 99,686 adherents, as against 522 Muhamma-dans and 7 Christians. The chief castes or tribes ranked as follows in numerical order in 1868:\u2014Kanets, 52,836; D\u00e1g\u00eds, 26,495; and Br\u00e1hmans, 6615. The Census for 1881 does not return the population of Sub-divisions according to caste or tribe. The first-named tribe probably represents impure or degraded Rajputs. The D\u00e1g\u00eds are hill aborigines. The character of the hillmen resembles that of most other mountaineers in its mixture of simplicity, independence,\nand superstition. Polyandry still prevails in Seor\u00e1j, but the custom is disappearing, and has almost died out elsewhere. It consists simply of a community of wives amongst brothers, who hold all their other goods in common, and regard their women as labourers on the farm. The temples usually occupy picturesque sites, and are dedicated rather to local deities than to the greater gods of the Hindu Pantheon.\n\nThe language, though peculiar to the valley, belongs essentially to the Indian or Neo-Sanskritic family, having a basis of Urdu and Pah\u00e1ri, with an infusion of Tibetan vocables. The only place deserving the name of town is Sultanpur, the former capital and modern headquarters of K\u00falu t\u00e1luk, on the right bank of the Beas. N\u00e1g\u00e1r, also a capital of the native R\u00e1j\u00e1s, possesses some interest from its fine old palace or castle, crowning an eminence, which rises above the Beas to the height of about 1000 feet. The castle has been recently restored, and is now the residence of the Assistant Commissioner in charge of K\u00falu Sub-division.\n\nThe Pl\u00e1ch or K\u00falu Mission was founded by the Rev. Dr. Carleton of the American Presbyterian Mission in 1868, and for ten successive years he spent the hot season in Pl\u00e1ch, engaging in medical work and preaching. In 1878 he purchased some land on the K\u00falu side of the Sutlej basin, about ten miles from the river, and there founded a Christian village. Since then but little mission work has been done in Pl\u00e1ch. The community of the new village now numbers 28 persons, all engaged in agriculture; and their example, under Dr. Carleton\u2019s guidance, has done something towards improving the simple agricultural practice of the neighbourhood. Four years ago a dispensary was built, and it has become so popular that a new and larger building is about to be erected.\n\nPasturage rights and customs.\u2014Pasturage is the occupation of a considerable proportion of the population, independent of, or subsidiary to, cultivation. Some villages muster large flocks of sheep and goats. During the spring or up till about the middle of June, the sheep stay in the wastes round about the hamlets; they then move up into the grazing grounds (g\u00e1hr) in the forests above the limits of cultivation, and graze there promiscuously; which they leave in July for sheep-runs (nig\u00e1hr) on the grassy slopes above the limits of forest, where they stay, each flock in its own run, for two months or till the middle of September; they then descend again to the lower grounds, and graze in them for about six weeks or till November. Villages with only a few sheep and goats, generally winter their flocks in K\u00falu at the bottom of the valleys; but large flocks are sent into Mandi State, where a ban or run is leased for the purpose from the R\u00e1j\u00e1.\n\nA sort of hereditary title to or interest in each nig\u00e1hr is asserted by some man or other. He is known as the r\u00e1sh\u00ed, and bases his claim\nupon a grant from the R\u00e1j\u00e1s, but can rarely or ever produce a deed. Sometimes he is a resident of the village in which the nig\u00e1hr is situated; sometimes he is a man of a distant village in which there are probably no nig\u00e1hrs, as the mountains are not high enough.\n\nTo each nig\u00e1hr is attached a certain number of grazing plots (th\u00e1ch) in the lower g\u00e1hrs; but when the flocks ascend in the spring, the g\u00e1hrs are free or open to all comers; the exclusive right to graze them arises when the flocks come down from the nig\u00e1hrs in September. These nig\u00e1hrs and g\u00e1hrs have tolerably definite boundaries, which are recognised by the shepherds, who hand down the knowledge of them among themselves. It is not easy to say to what the interest of a r\u00e1s\u00fa in a nig\u00e1hr and g\u00e1hr amounts. It is not in any sense a proprietorship of the soil; but rather an hereditary managership to be exercised in the r\u00e1s\u00fa's own interest and that of his neighbours than an exclusive right of grazing vested in one man or one family only. The r\u00e1s\u00fa in practice always forms his flock by collecting together all the sheep and goats of his own and neighbouring hamlets, and he takes nothing from the owners who accompany him in the shape of fee or due. It is doubtful whether he could give a preference to strangers, or to the people of other hamlets than those who have been accustomed to combine their flocks with his. But of late years the r\u00e1s\u00fas have often dealt with their nig\u00e1hrs in a fashion not quite consistent with this theory of the limited nature of their rights; for instance, some of them who have lost their flocks and ceased to be shepherds, have given leave to other men to form flocks and go to their nig\u00e1hrs for the year, and have taken from them two or three rupees as a presentation fee. It appears, however, that the man so sent in place of a r\u00e1s\u00fa has ordinarily been one of his old companions who used to resort to the run in his company.\n\nIn the lowlands in and around the villages, the sheep graze promiscuously like the cattle. Ordinarily speaking, a flock belonging to a man of one hamlet would not be driven to graze in another, but within the village lands he may drive them where he likes, without reference to, or nearness, or the contrary, to his own hamlet; and in waste lands near the boundary of two villages, the neighbouring hamlets on both sides frequently have a common right of grazing. In some places the villages high up in the mountains have by custom a right to send their flocks to winter in the waste lands of those lower down, which are not so much exposed to frost and snowstorms.\n\nIn the times of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s, and down to the Regular Settlement, a tax was levied on all sheep and goats in K\u00falu at the rate of 1 anna per head per annum. This tax was on account of the grazing for the whole year, and therefore no special rents or dues were imposed on the nig\u00e1hrs or summer sheep-runs. It is said that something of the kind ought to be done again, as it now happens that the villages which\npay the least revenue graze the most sheep, and Government loses greatly by the absence of such an impost. Some temples exact a fee of a sheep or goat from the flock which resorts to certain runs in their neighbourhood, but this fee, though now claimed as a right, originated in the idea that the mountain in question was the peculiar haunt of the temple god who ought to be propitiated, and not in any grant to the temples by the R\u00e1j\u00e1s. The numerous flocks from Simla territory, which spend the summer in K\u00falu, formerly paid 1 anna per head for the summer grazing only. In the Waz\u00edr\u00ed R\u00fap\u00ed tract, these taxes both on native and foreign sheep are still collected by the R\u00e1j\u00e1; but since the first regular land settlement in 1852, even sheep from other Districts which resort to nig\u00e1hrs belonging to Government villages, have paid nothing. Nearly all the foreign sheep, however, go to Waz\u00edr\u00ed R\u00fap\u00ed, which contains the best nig\u00e1hrs in K\u00falu.\n\nBy custom, the grazing of beasts of burden in waste lands alongside the high road is free to all traders or travellers on the march. In the winter and spring many are to be found encamped in the Beas valley. Shepherds can use any route they please when on the march to and from the summer pasture grounds, and halt a day or two, if necessary, anywhere in the waste. The shepherds from K\u00e1ngra, before crossing the Hanta pass into L\u00e1hul, spend some days in the forests above Jagat Sukh.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Out of a total area of State lands amounting to 799,834 acres, the revised settlement returns in 1872 show 762,467 acres unoccupied, as against 37,367 acres in occupation. Of the latter amount, 32,884 acres are under actual cultivation, the remainder being set down as waste or grass lands. The total area under crops, including 14,210 acres, yielding two harvests in the year, is returned at 37,110 acres. The above figures do not include the tract known as Waz\u00edr\u00ed R\u00fap\u00ed, which has a total area of 433,050 acres, and is alienated in jag\u00edr to the ex-ruling family. The average cultivated area for the five years ending 1881\u201382 is returned at 41,682 acres. Seven-eighths of the unoccupied waste lie above the limits of possible cultivation. The staple spring products include wheat, barley, poppy, tobacco, and oil-seeds; the autumn crops are maize, rice, pulses, and millets.\n\nThe average area under the principal crops for the five years ending 1881\u201382 is returned as under\u2014wheat, 13,404 acres; barley, 7014 acres; Indian corn, 5666 acres; rice, 4707 acres; and poppy, 1456 acres. The poppy is a lucrative crop, and cultivators who have no rice lands rely upon it to pay their land revenue. Opium is but little used locally, although the poppy seed is freely eaten. The manufactured opium is bought up by traders for export to the plains, at a price varying from 6s. to 15s. per lb., the fluctuation in price depending less on the crop than on the influx of buyers. Rice, the most important of\nthe autumn crops, is grown wherever water is plentiful, its range being from 3600 to 7000 feet above sea-level.\n\nThe cultivation of tea has spread from Kangra Proper into Kulu; but the area under cultivation is said to be less than 100 acres, and there seems to be very little land in the Kulu valley well suited for the cultivation of tea. The quality of the leaf is excellent, but the out-turn is light. In the lower part of the main valley, the rainfall is very uncertain; while in the upper valley there is a sufficient rainfall, but hardly enough warmth. The land is often cold and marshy at a short depth below the surface; and a combination of a hot sun above, and cold water at the root, appears to kill the plant.\n\nIrrigation is effected by small canals cut from the hill streams, as much as 19 per cent. of the cultivated area being artificially supplied with water in the greater part of Kulu Proper.\n\nThe tenure of land has been largely assimilated to the ordinary Indian system, the whole artificial village, made up of separate hamlets, being held jointly responsible for the entire land revenue assessed upon it. At the time of the revised land settlement in 1872, there were 771 holdings with a total area of 567 acres held rent free in lieu of service, and 3943 holdings with a total area of 5494 acres held by tenants paying rent either in money or kind. The average area of each holding, three acres, seems very small, and the average Government assessment of Rs. 6, or 12s., if compared with the value of the crops, appears heavy. In a great number of villages the fields give absolutely no income, and nothing is produced in them which it would pay to export to the nearest market. But in these places the people have their flocks to fall back upon by selling a sheep and a little home-spun cloth or a blanket; they can make good the whole demand, or they can earn a good deal of money (as many do), by gathering wild roots and herbs in the forests, and selling them in Sult\u0101npur or at R\u0101mpur for export to the plains. Dh\u016bp (Dolomiora macrocephala), used as incense in India and China, and karr\u016b and chiretta, kinds of gentians, used in medicine, are the principal articles so sold. Then they have their honey and beeswax; the upper verandahs of the houses are often full of beehives formed of short lengths of hollow trunks of trees covered at top, and with an entrance hole in the side. Again, by snaring a musk deer and selling its pods, or shooting a leopard or bear and claiming the reward, a sum equal to one or two years' land-tax may be secured at one blow.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The surplus commodities of Kulu consist of rice, barley, wheat, opium, tobacco, tea, and honey. The rice, barley, and wheat go chiefly to supply the barren valley of Lahul, though a little grain also finds its way to the plains. Traders from the Punjab towns and neighbouring Hill States buy up the opium,\nwhile the tobacco is exported both into L\u00e1hul and Spiti, and into the Simla States. Rice, wheat, and barley are also bartered for salt, with the Tibetans who come down to Patseo in L\u00e1hul. Honey and tea are exported to the plains. Sheep are annually sold in large numbers to traders from Simla, at an average price of 7s. or 8s. per head. It is not, however, solely with this object that they are bred. The flesh is freely eaten by the people, and the wool is woven into cloth and blankets in every village, the blankets of Seor\u00e1j and Waz\u00edr R\u00fap\u00ed being of superior excellence, and sold at prices ranging from 4s. to 10s. each. The imports consist of borax from Lad\u00e1kh; brass and copper utensils from the Punjab plains; salt and iron from Mandi. Horses, silk, and charas (an intoxicating preparation of hemp) are also largely imported.\n\nRoads, etc.\u2014Two roads lead from Kangra to Sult\u00e1npur, and another connects the same place with Simla. Wooden bridges cross the principal rivers, and the Beas is spanned by a steel-rope suspension bridge at Shamsi. The main route to Leh and Y\u00e1rkand follows the right bank of the Beas, crosses the Rohtang Pass, pursues the valley of the Bh\u00e1ga to Bar\u00e1 L\u00e1cha Pass, and thence descends into Lad\u00e1kh. A post-office has been established at Sult\u00e1npur, with a daily mail from P\u00e1lampur. Education remains at a very low ebb, but Government schools exist at the two principal villages. Sult\u00e1npur also possesses a Government charitable dispensary.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The average annual rainfall of the valley may be put at from 45 to 50 inches. The mean temperature for the month of August amounts to 78\u00b0 F.; that of November to 55\u00b0. The climate cannot be considered favourable to health. Intermittent fevers and bowel complaints prevail in an endemic form, while epidemics of virulent contagious fever and cholera break out from time to time. Goitre and cretinism also occur, as in other confined valleys. Much of the mortality might probably be prevented by cleanliness and better sanitary arrangements; but the rank vegetation, damp soil, and hot sun will always prove prejudicial to the public health, in the opinion of the settlement officer.

Lyall, C.S.; together with the Punjab Census Report of 1881.]\n\nKulutzai.\u2014Village in the Lad\u00e1kh Division of Kashm\u00edr State, Northern India; perched upon an elevated site above the right bank of the Indus. Lat. 34\u00b0 19' N., long. 76\u00b0 58' E. A wooden bridge crosses the river, which is here about 25 yards in width. The population consists chiefly of Buddhists.\nKumalgarh.\u2014Fort in the Native State of Udaipur, Rajputana. Built by R\u00e1na Kumbhu in the 15th century, on the site of a more ancient fortress, of which mountaineers long held possession. Tradition ascribes it to Sumprit, a Jain prince in the 2nd century; and ancient Jain temples appear to confirm the tradition. The fortress is situated near the village of Kailw\u00e1ra on a steep and craggy mountain, rising to the height of 3568 feet above sea-level, and about 700 feet above the pass below, which it commands. The massive wall, with numerous towers and pierced battlements, encloses a space of some miles in extent below, while tier above tier of ramparts rise to the summit of the hill, which is crowned with the B\u00e1dal Mahal, or cloud-palace of the R\u00e1n\u00e1s, whence the eye ranges far to the west over the sandy deserts of Marw\u00e1r and the chaotic mountain group of the Aravallis. Besides the Arail Pol, or barrier, thrown across the first narrow ascent, about a mile from Kailw\u00e1ra, there is a second gate, called the Hull\u00e1 Pol, intermediate to the Hanum\u00e1n Pol, the exterior gate of the fortress, between which and the summit there are four more gates.\n\nKum\u00e1on.\u2014Division and District in the North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Kumaun.\n\nKum\u00e1r (also called Pang\u00e1s\u00ed).\u2014River of the Gangetic Delta, Bengal. An offshoot of the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1, leaving the main stream near Alim-d\u00e1ng\u00e1, and flowing a tortuous easterly and south-easterly course, first for a few miles through Nadiy\u00e1 District, and afterwards through Jessor, till it forms a connection with the Gar\u00e1i (Gorai). The head of the river is closed during summer by a bar of sand, and silting is rapidly going on in its upper reaches. In Jessor, the river deepens into a beautiful stream of clear water, navigable by large boats all the year round.\n\nKum\u00e1r.\u2014River in Far\u00eddpur District, Bengal; a branch of the Chandna, taking off from that river near Madhukh\u00e1li, a few miles west of Far\u00eddpur town, and, flowing a tortuous course generally from north-west to south-east, falls into the Ari\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n at Mad\u00e1ripur, in lat. 23\u00b0 10' N., and long. 90\u00b0 15' 45\" E. Navigable for small boats throughout the year.\n\nKum\u00e1radh\u00e1ri.\u2014River in South K\u00e1nara District, Madras Presidency; rises in lat. 13\u00b0 50' N., and long. 76\u00b0 52' E., in the Bisli Gh\u00e1t on the boundary between Coorg and Hassan District of Mysore, below the Pushpagiri or Subrahmanya range of the Western Gh\u00e1tis, and flows westwards towards the Malabar coast. Near the village of Uppin\u00e1ngadi it joins the Netravati river, and the combined stream, under the latter name, flows into the sea near Mangalore. In the lower part of its course it is much used for navigation; small boats can proceed even above Uppin\u00e1ngadi.\nKum\u00e1rganj.\u2014Village in Din\u00e1jpur District, Bengal; situated on the Atr\u00e1i river. One of the principal seats of local trade.\n\nKum\u00e1rganj.\u2014Village and head-quarters of a police circle (th\u00e1n\u00e1) in the head-quarters Sub-division of Rangpur District, Bengal; situated on the right bank of the Karat\u00f3y\u00e1 river.\n\nKum\u00e1ri.\u2014Village on the headland forming the extreme southernmost point of India.\u2014See COMORIN.\n\nKum\u00e1rkh\u00e1l\u00ed (Comercolly).\u2014Town, municipality, and head-quarters of a police circle (th\u00e1n\u00e1) in the Kusht\u00eda Sub-division of Nadiy\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated on the left bank of the Gar\u00e1i (Gorai) river. Lat. 23\u00b0 51' 30\" N., long. 89\u00b0 17' 14\" E. Population (1872) 5251; (1881) 6041, namely, Hindus, 3676; Muhammadans, 2356; and 'others,' 9. Area of town site, 640 acres. Municipal income (1876\u201377), \u00a3215; (1881), \u00a3353; incidence of taxation, 1s. 1\u00bdd. per head. Station on the Eastern Bengal Railway, 118 miles from Calcutta. During the mercantile days of the East Indian Company, a commercial Resident was stationed at Kum\u00e1rkh\u00e1l\u00ed, and a large business in silk was carried on. A few old tombs in a small cemetery, the earliest dating from 1790, are all the existing remains marking the former existence of the Company's factory. The cemetery is now used as a burial-ground for employ\u00e9s of the Eastern Bengal Railway.\n\nKum\u00e1un.\u2014Division or Commissionership under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces. The Division comprises the three British Districts of Kumaun, Garhwal, and Tar\u00e1i, all of which see separately. It is bounded on the north by the Tibetan territory of Hundes; on the east by the independent kingdom of Nep\u00e1l; on the south by the Rohilkhand Districts of Pilibhit, Bareli (Bareilly), Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Bijnor, and by the Native State of Rampur; and on the west by the District of Dehra Dun and by Native Garhw\u00e1l.\n\nArea, 12,438 square miles; number of towns and villages, 9578; number of houses, 153,605. Total population (1881) 1,046,263, namely, males 545,124, and females 501,139. Average density of population, 84\u00b71 persons per square mile, ranging from 220 in the submontane strip which forms the Tar\u00e1i District to 62\u00b78 per square mile in the mountainous region of Garhw\u00e1l. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 955,100, or 91\u00b73 per cent.; Muhammadans, 88,320, or 8\u00b74 per cent.; Christians, 2646; Jains, 103; Buddhists, 87; and P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 7. Among the Hindus, the higher castes are unusually strongly represented, Br\u00e1hmans numbering 204,994, and R\u00e1jputs 425,061, these two classes numbering altogether upwards of two-thirds of the Hindu population. The Muhammadans are almost without exception Sunnis. The Christian population consists mainly of European troops cantoned at the hill stations of R\u00e1n\u00edkhet, Almora, and N\u00e1ini T\u00e1l. The villages,\nespecially in the hill Districts, are mere hamlets of a few houses. Out of a total of 9578 villages and towns, 8462 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 946 between two hundred and five hundred; 140 from five hundred to a thousand; 25 from one to five thousand; and 5 upwards of five thousand inhabitants. Total male adult agriculturists, 308,632, cultivating 506,752 acres, or an average of 1'64 acre per head. The population entirely dependent on the soil numbers 833,573, or 79'7 per cent. of the total population. The cultivation bears but a small proportion to the total area, only 792 square miles being returned as under tillage in 1881, of which 738 square miles were assessed for Government revenue. The uncultivable area is returned at 9223'5 square miles, and that still available for tillage at 2422'5 square miles.\n\nTotal Government land revenue, including local rates and cesses levied on land, \u00a357,257, or an average of 2s. 4\u00bdd. per cultivated acre; average rental paid by cultivators in the Tar\u00e1\u00ed District, 4s. 9\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. In the hill Districts of Kum\u00e1un and Garhw\u00e1l, a very large proportion of the cultivators are also proprietors, and pay no rent other than the Government revenue demand. The head-quarters of the Commissioner of the Division are at Almora in Kum\u00e1un District. The sanitarium of N\u00e1ini T\u00e1l in the same District is the residence of the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces for several months in the year, and the head-quarters of his Government. It is also a favourite summer retreat for Europeans during the hot-weather months.\n\nKum\u00e1un.\u2014The principal District in the Division of the same name in the North-Western Provinces, including the Sub-divisions of Almora or Kum\u00e1un Proper, Champ\u00e1wat, and the Bh\u00e1bhar. It lies between lat. 28\u00b0 55' and 30\u00b0 50' 30\" N., and between long. 78\u00b0 52' and 80\u00b0 56' 15\" E. Area, 6000 square miles. Population in 1881, 493,641 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at Almora town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Kum\u00e1un District consists, first, of the sub-Himalayan ranges; and, secondly, of the bh\u00e1bhar or waterless forest, averaging from 10 to 15 miles in breadth, which stretches between the mountains and the Tar\u00e1\u00ed. Of the entire area of the highlands, only 500 square miles are returned as cultivated, and 100 square miles as cultivable. No country exhibits more extraordinary diversities of temperature and climate than Kum\u00e1un. The southern or bh\u00e1bhar portion is of considerable elevation. It is distinguished by a total absence of running water, and is bounded on the south by a line of springs. This tract consists of the loose detritus of the lower hills, resting on a bed of hard clay. The moisture, instead of flowing off from the surface, sinks downwards to the clay beneath, over which it percolates in a southern\ndirection, and eventually comes to light in the Tar\u00e1i. The rivers descending from the lower hills, in the same manner lose a considerable portion of their volume on entering the bh\u00e1bhar; and in many instances, during the hot and cold seasons, their beds are perfectly dry for the space of 9 or 10 miles, after which they again fill with water, and, reinforced by the numerous springs which gush out of the earth on the border of the moist country, form the characteristic feature of the Tar\u00e1i.\n\nUp to 1850, the bh\u00e1bhar was an almost impenetrable forest, given up to wild animals; but since then, the numerous clearings have attracted a large population from the hills, who cultivate the rich soil during the hot and cold seasons, returning home in the rains. The bh\u00e1bhar is, however, still for the most part unreclaimed jungle of the thickest and most luxuriant description; and what changes have taken place in the appearance of this tract by clearing and irrigation, have all been effected within the last twenty-five years, under the personal superintendence of Sir Henry Ramsay, the late Commissioner of Kum\u00e1un. With the exception of these low lands, and a few similar tracts of small extent stretching along the great rivers in the lower parts of their courses, Kum\u00e1un is a maze of mountains, some of which are among the loftiest known. The ranges run, as a rule, from east to west in groups, connected and intersected by other ridges varying much in elevation, and gradually increasing in height as they approach the north and north-east frontier, which divides the drainage system of the Indus and Sutlej from that of the Ganges.\n\nThe crest of the N\u00edti Pass is 16,570 feet above the sea; the M\u00e1n\u00e1 Pass, 18,000 feet; the Juh\u00e1r or Milam Pass, 17,270 feet. To the west, on the boundary of Garhw\u00e1l, is the Tr\u00eds\u00fal Mountain, so called from its peaks having the appearance of a trident, the most easterly of which attains an elevation of 22,342 feet, the middle peak 23,092 feet, and the western peak 23,382 feet. To the north-east of Tr\u00eds\u00fal is Nand\u00e1 Dev\u00ed, with an elevation of 25,661 feet; and Nandakot, the katiya or couch of the great goddess Nand\u00e1, with a height of 22,538 feet. Farther east are the two highest of the P\u00e1nchch\u00fala peaks, 22,673 and 21,114 feet respectively. In fact, in a tract not more than 140 miles in length and 40 miles in breadth, there are over 30 peaks rising to elevations exceeding 18,000 feet. South of the thirtieth parallel of latitude no peaks attain the limit of perpetual snow, and few exceed 10,000 feet.\n\nThe rivers chiefly take their rise in the southern slope of the Tibetan watershed to the north of the loftiest peaks, amongst which they make their way down valleys of rapid declivity and extraordinary depth. Enumerated from east to west, the principal rivers are\u2014the\nK\u00e1li, known as the S\u00e1rda where it debouches on the plains, and as the Gogra (Gh\u00e1gra) farther south to its junction with the Ganges on the borders of Bengal; and its affluents the eastern Dhauli, G\u00fanta, Gorigang\u00e1, eastern R\u00e1mgang\u00e1, and Sarju; next come the Pindar and K\u00e1ilgang\u00e1, whose waters join the Alaknanda. Inferior to these, but connected with them, are the drainage lines of the southern and less elevated table-lands. Of such the principal are the Ladiya, Baliya Bhakra, Bauri, Kosi, and western R\u00e1mgang\u00e1, which last takes its rise in Garhw\u00e1l District; but ultimately all reach the Ganges. It is only by the beds of these rivers that access is afforded to the District from the plains on the south and Hundes on the north.\n\nThere are several lakes in the Chhakh\u00e1ta pargan\u00e1, the overflow of which is used for providing the small canals of the bh\u00e1bhar with water during the cold and hot seasons. In the Him\u00e1layan ranges, also, are several unimportant natural reservoirs resembling lakes. The principal lakes are\u2014the N\u00e1ini T\u00e1l, 4703 feet long by 1518 feet broad, with a maximum depth of 93 feet, and circumference of 2\u00bd miles; Bh\u00edm T\u00e1l, 5580 feet long by 1490 broad, with a maximum depth of 87 feet; Naukuchiya, 3120 feet long by 2270 broad, with a maximum depth of 132 feet; M\u00e1lw\u00e1 T\u00e1l, 4480 feet long by 1833 broad, with a maximum depth of 127 feet. Although the successive steep ridges of Kum\u00e1un are only separated by narrow ravines instead of by true valleys, yet, as compared with Garhw\u00e1l and other cis-Sutlej western Districts, it can boast of some extensive river plateaux and level uplands, which give a peculiar character to its scenery. Of the former, Sumesw\u00e1r and Hawalb\u00e1gh on the Kosi, the Katy\u00far valley on the Gaomati, and the whole centre tract of P\u00e1l\u00ed watered by the Gag\u00e1s and western R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 are remarkable examples; of the latter, may be mentioned Ch\u00e1r\u00e1l in K\u00e1li Kum\u00e1un, and the neighbourhood of Loh\u00e1gh\u00e1t and Pithor\u00e1g\u00e1rh.\n\nThe valuable timber of the yet uncleared forest tracts in Kum\u00e1un is now under official supervision. The chief trees are the chir or three-leaved Him\u00e1layan pine, the cypress, fir, alder, s\u00e1l or iron-wood, and saindan. S\u00e1l, the most valuable of all, grows abundantly in the valleys, stretching down to the plains, and is strictly preserved by the Forest Department.\n\nLimestone, sandstone, slate, gneiss, and granite constitute the principal geological formations of the District. Mines of iron, copper, gypsum, lead, and asbestos exist; but they are not thoroughly worked, and often their inaccessible position, combined with the absence of coal, renders any profitable out-turn impossible.\n\nThe fauna and flora of Kum\u00e1un District are very varied, but can only be described shortly. The wild animals include the leopard, hy\u00e6na, black and brown bear, jackal, monkey, fox, deer of several\nspecies, chamois, and yak or Himalayan ox. Elephants are found in the bh\u0101dhar, and in the forests bordering on the Siwalik Hills. They are now protected by order of Government, and are captured, when required, by means of khedas. Tigers are becoming scarcer every year. Venomous snakes are numerous. The mora fly is very troublesome in the months of April and May.\n\nHistory.\u2014Of the early history of Kum\u00e1un very little is known. The few facts on record tend to show that at a remote period these mountains were the recognised home of the hero-gods of India, and an object of veneration to all Hindus. In the travels of the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsiang in the 7th century, the kingdom of Govisana, now identified with K\u00e1sipur in the Kum\u00e1un tar\u00e1i, is mentioned as adjacent to Brahmaputra within the hill territory, a seat of civilised government. The earliest dynasty known to tradition is that of the Katy\u00fara Deos, eventually supplanted by the Chand R\u00e1j\u00e1s, the former reigning at Baijn\u00e1th in the Katy\u00far valley, at which place, and also at Dw\u00e1ra H\u00e1t, architectural remains are still extant. The Chand R\u00e1j\u00e1s, of whom the first, Som Chand, is said to have come from Jhusi, near Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, probably in the 10th century of our era, had their established seat of Government at Champ\u00e1wat in K\u00e1l\u00ed Kum\u00e1un.\n\nIn 1563 A.D., the Chands having obtained full authority over all the petty chiefs, including the last descendant of the Katy\u00faras, the capital was transferred to Almora by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Kaly\u00e1n Chand. His son R\u00fadra Chand was a contemporary of Akbar, and made his obeisance to that Emperor at Lahore in 1587. The Muhammadan rulers never obtained a fixed footing in the hills; but in 1744, Al\u00ed Muhammad Kh\u00e1n sent a force to invade Kum\u00e1un. The resistance of the Chand R\u00e1j\u00e1 was weak and ineffectual. The Rohill\u00e1s captured and plundered Almora. Though their stay in Kum\u00e1un was short, its results to the Province are bitterly remembered; and its mischievous, though zealously religious, character is still attested by the mutilated sculptures of some of the Kum\u00e1un temples. The Rohill\u00e1s remained in the hills for seven months, when, disgusted with the climate and the hardships that they were forced to suffer, they accepted a bribe of three l\u0101khs of rupees (or \u00a330,000), and returned to the plains. But Al\u00ed Muhammad Kh\u00e1n was not satisfied with the conduct of his lieutenants; and three months after their retreat, at the commencement of 1745, the Rohill\u00e1s returned. They were defeated at the very entrance of the hills near B\u00e1rakheri, and made no further attempt on Kum\u00e1un. These were the first and last Muhammadan invasions of the hills. The Delhi Emperors never exercised any direct authority in Kum\u00e1un, although it was necessary for the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to admit their nominal supremacy for the sake of his possessions in the plains. These events were followed by disturbances and revolutions in Kum\u00e1un itself; and within the next thirty years the\nhill R\u00e1j\u00e1s lost all the country which they had held in the plains, except the tract known as the bh\u00e1bhar.\n\nIn the middle of the 18th century, the G\u00farkha tribe, under their chief Prithwi N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, had made themselves masters of the most important part of the present kingdom of Nep\u00e1l. His successors determined, in 1790, to attack Kum\u00e1un. The G\u00farkha forces crossed the K\u00e1l\u00ed, and advanced upon Almora through Gangoli and K\u00e1l\u00ed Kum\u00e1un. The titular R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kum\u00e1un fled to the plains, and the whole of his territory was annexed to the other conquests of the G\u00farkhas. The Nep\u00e1lese rule lasted twenty-four years, and was of a cruel and oppressive character. In the early part of the present century, the G\u00farkhas had been making numerous raids in the British possessions lying at the foot of the Him\u00e1layas. All remonstrance was unavailing; and in December 1814, it was finally resolved to wrest Kum\u00e1un from the G\u00farkhas, and annex it to the British possessions, as no legitimate claimant on the part of the Chands was then in existence. Harakdeo Joshi, the minister of the last legitimate R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kum\u00e1un, warmly espoused the British side. At the end of January 1815, everything was ready for the attack on Kum\u00e1un. The whole force consisted of 4500 men with two 6-pounder guns.\n\nThe first successful event on the British side during this war was the capture of Almora by Colonel Nicholls, on 26th April 1815. On the same day, Chandra Bah\u00e1dur S\u00e1h, one of the principal G\u00farkha chiefs, sent a flag of truce to Colonel Nicholls, requesting a suspension of hostilities, and offering to treat for the evacuation of Kum\u00e1un. Lieutenant-Colonel Gardner was deputed to hold a personal conference with Bam S\u00e1h, the Nep\u00e1lese commander at Almora; and on the following day the negotiation was brought to a close by the conclusion of a convention, under which the G\u00farkhas agreed to evacuate the Province and all its fortified places. It was stipulated that they should be allowed to retire across the K\u00e1l\u00ed with their military stores and private property, the British providing the necessary supplies and carriage. As a pledge for the due fulfilment of the conditions, the fort of L\u00e1mandi (now Fort Moira) was the same day surrendered to the British troops. Captain Hearsey, who had been taken and imprisoned at Almora, was released at the same time. The G\u00farkhas were escorted across the K\u00e1l\u00ed by our troops, and the British took possession of Kum\u00e1un and Garhw\u00e1l.\n\nThe Hon. E. Gardner was the first Commissioner of Kum\u00e1un; and in August 1817 he was succeeded by his assistant, Mr. Traill. He was followed in 1835 by Colonel Gowan and Mr. S. T. Lushington, under the latter of whom Mr. J. H. Batten carried out the first regular settlement of the Province, and in 1848 succeeded Mr. Lushington as Commissioner. In 1856, Captain (now Major-General Sir Henry) Ramsay was appointed Commissioner, and until 1883 managed the affairs of Kum\u00e1un.\nMr. P. Whalley, in his Report on the non-Regulation Provinces, states that the administrative history of Kum\u00e1un divides itself naturally into three periods\u2014under Traill, under Batten, and under Ramsay. The r\u00e9gime in the first period was essentially despotic and personal, in contrast with the centralizing tendencies which the policy of the Government had developed. It was at the same time just and eminently progressive. Mr. Traill\u2019s incumbency terminated in 1835, and then followed an interval of uncertainty. Traill left the Province orderly, prosperous, and comparatively civilised; but his machinery was not easily worked by another hand. There was no law, and the lawgiver had been withdrawn. The Board of Commissioners and the Government found it necessary to re-assert their control, and to lay down specific rules in matters that had hitherto been left to the judgment of the Commissioner.\n\nMr. Batten was then only Assistant Commissioner of Garhw\u00e1l, but he was a man eminently qualified both by training and disposition to second the action of Government, and to assist in the inauguration of the new era. His talents had already been recognised, and from this period he was consulted in every step; and it was his influence, more than that of any single officer, which gave its stamp and character to the period (1836\u201356) distinguished by his name. It was marked in its earlier stage by an introduction of codes and rules and the predominance of official supervision, which gradually diminished as Mr. Batten gained influence, position, and experience. Thus the second period glided insensibly into the third, which, nevertheless, has a distinctive character of its own. In General Ramsay\u2019s administration we see the personal sway and unhampered autocracy of the first era happily blending with the orderly procedure and observance of fixed rules and principles, which formed the chief feature of the second period.\n\nPopulation, etc.\u2014The population of Kum\u00e1un in 1872, on an area corresponding with the present District, was returned at 433,314. The Census of 1881 returned the population at 493,641, showing an increase of 60,327, or 13\u00b79 per cent., in the nine years. The results of the Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area, 6000 square miles; number of towns and villages, 5151; number of houses, 72,964. Total population, 493,641, namely, males 261,054, and females 232,587; proportion of males in total population, 52\u00b78 per cent. Average density of population, 82\u00b72 persons per square mile; number of villages per square mile, .85; persons per village, 96; persons per occupied house, 6\u00b77. In religion, the District is almost exclusively Hindu. The Census of 1881 returned the Hindus as numbering 479,948, or 97\u00b72 per cent. of the total population; Muhammadans, 11,261, or 2\u00b73 per cent.; Christians, 2393; Buddhists, 32; and P\u00e1rsis, 7.\nThe Musalm\u00e1ns are chiefly recent immigrants from the plains, or the descendants of the retainers of the Kum\u00e1un R\u00e1j\u00e1s. The majority of the Hindus belong to the tribe of Kh\u00e1sias, not to be confused with the inhabitants of the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills in Assam. The Kh\u00e1sias of Kum\u00e1un are to all intents and purposes Hindus in religion and customs, and their language is purely Hindu, as shown both by the archaic records extant and by their present dialect. There is every reason to believe that the original Kh\u00e1sias, or inhabitants of Khasdes, mentioned by the Hindu lawgiver Manu, some 2500 years ago, were identical with the modern tribe of Kh\u00e1sias. Successive immigrations from the plains imposed upon them masters, who absorbed all power, and introduced observances characteristic of the Br\u00e1hman and R\u00e1jput castes, to which they themselves now claim to belong. Indeed, these two castes (Brahmans numbering 120,137 in 1881, and R\u00e1jputs 216,247) now form nearly three-fourths of the entire population. The Doms (104,936 in number), corresponding to the Cham\u00e1rs of the plains, rank as the lowest of the Kh\u00e1sias, and until the British occupation they were the pr\u00e6dial slaves of the landholders. It is by no means proved that these Doms are the descendants of any non-Aryan aboriginal race. They share with their Kh\u00e1sia countrymen the superstitious belief in demons and sprites common to all mountaineers. Every crag and summit has its local deity and shrine, at which kids are offered in sacrifice; at the larger temples at river junctions buffaloes are similarly slaughtered. Most of the great tribes of Northern India have their representatives amongst the hill communities, and among the Br\u00e1hmans the tribe of astrologers, known as jyotishs or joshis, have attained the greatest influence.\n\nThe Bhotiyas (from Bhot, the corrupt form of Bod or Tibet) inhabit the country lying north of the great peaks. The Bhotiyas are distinctly of Tibetan origin, but they are little inclined themselves to admit this fact. In the Juh\u00e1r valley especially, they have adopted the language and customs of their Hindu neighbours; though, if report be true, when once across the border they do as the Tibetans do, and are good Buddhists. The features and dialect of the Bhotiyas resemble closely those of the people of Tibet. The Kum\u00e1unis themselves are a tolerably fair, good-looking race; and, except in the extreme northern parsana, any difference of feature may be attributed to climatic influences rather than to any extensive intermixture of Tartar blood. On the whole, the character of the people is estimable and pleasing. The men are active, cheerful, honest, and industrious. The women in their youth are generally pretty. The custom of polyandry is here unknown, but polygamy is frequent.\n\nThe 5151 villages or hamlets of the District are scattered about the hill-sides, the houses being built of stone laid in mud, and\nroofed with slates, or with planks or thatch. No less than 4662 villages contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 435 from two to five hundred; 44 from five hundred to a thousand; and only 10 upwards of a thousand inhabitants. The better class of dwellings are ornamented with wooden carvings, principally of t\u00fan-wood (Cedrela toona). The only native town is Almora. Champawat, the ruined capital of the Chands, ranks only as a village, though it boasts of a tashili in the old fort. There are large b\u00e1z\u00e1rs at the European stations of Naini Tal and Ranikhet. Milam, the principal residence of the Juh\u00e1r Bhotiyas, is a large, well-built village, but is uninhabitable between November and May. Of the mandis or market gatherings in the bh\u00e1bhar, R\u00e1mnagar on the Kosi is the most considerable.\n\nClassified according to occupation, the Census Report of 1881 returned the male population as follows:\u2014(1) Professional, including all Government servants, and the learned professions, 3599; (2) domestic class, 5586; (3) commercial class, 1405; (4) agricultural class, 150,946; (5) industrial class, 13,113; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, 86,405.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The agriculture of the bh\u00e1bhar is being assimilated so rapidly to that of the plains, that a separate notice of it is hardly required. Wheat and mustard form a large proportion of the rab\u00ed or spring crops, and the irrigation absolutely necessary for all cultivation in that tract is supplied by a well-organized system of small canals. The area available for cultivation is small in Kum\u00e1un. In order to remedy this deficiency, the sides of hills, wherever possible, have been cut down into terraces, rising above each other in regular succession, and having their fronts supported by stone abutments. The soil, except in some of the valleys, is often poor and stony, and requires much manure. In certain localities, periodical cultivation with the hoe only is carried on. On the better kinds of land, rice, wheat, and tobacco are grown; on the others, according to the season, wheat, barley, mustard, vetch, flax, Indian corn, millets, pulses, sugar-cane, cotton, oil-seeds, etc. The staple food of the peasantry is the millet called mandua (Eleusine corocana), the r\u00e1gi of the Deccan. The cucumber family is largely used; and in the southernmost pargan\u00e1s, ginger, turmeric, and capsicums are profitable crops. Potatoes are becoming common in some localities, but are not so plentifully grown as in the Simla Hills. Fruit is very plentiful in Kum\u00e1un. The oranges grown here are of excellent quality.\n\nThe tea plantations form now an important and valuable feature in the District, but are almost entirely in the hands of European owners. In 1876\u201377 the number of gardens was 19, covering an area of 2222 acres. The total yield of tea in that year was 261,060 lbs. In 1882\u201383 the number of plantations was returned at\nbut no statistics are given showing the area under cultivation or the out-turn. Both are probably nearly double the return for 1876-77. The recent opening up of the Central Asian market through Afghan traders, who come to the plantations in person, has given a fresh impetus to this industry, which had begun to decline.\n\nLanded property in Kum\u00e1un, both in theory and practice, has ever been vested in the State. The occupant landholders possess an hereditary and transferable property in the soil, but their rights were never indefeasible and have always been revocable at the hands of the sovereign. The proprietary right is in a state of extreme sub-division, each hamlet or village being shared commonly amongst many petty proprietors. Where the proprietary and occupancy rights are vested in the same individual, the cultivating tenants under him possess no rights in the soil, and are mere tenants-at-will. Fully three-fifths of the arable land in Kum\u00e1un are cultivated by the proprietors themselves. Proprietors simply pay their share of the Government demand; while old occupancy tenants (khayak\u00e1rs) are subject to an additional money payment, in commutation of certain dues and fees formerly demanded.\n\nIn native times, Br\u00e1hmans and other principal grantees cultivated their lands by means of h\u00e1lyas or domestic slaves. In the tea plantations, the planters hold their estates in what would be elsewhere called pure zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri right, including that portion of the adjacent forest and waste, within fixed boundaries, to which Government has given up its claim. A very few instances of such tenure also exist among the principal natives of the District. The head-man of every village is called the pradh\u00e1n, whose office is often hereditary, but essentially elective. In large estates each clan has its own representative head-man. The Government revenue is collected by and paid through the pradh\u00e1ns, who are remunerated by rent-free lands and certain fees and privileges. They are the local police officers in each village for reporting offences, etc. The higher class of hereditary head-men are called sij\u00e1ns, kam\u00edns, and thokd\u00e1rs.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014No universal famine has taken place in Kum\u00e1un since the British gained possession of the District. The worst calamities of this kind were in 1838 and 1867. Disastrous floods are almost unknown, but sometimes, as in 1840, the valley lands suffer from sudden freshets, which cover the soil with barren gravel. Heavy rains, too, wash away field terrace-walls, and houses and lands are occasionally injured by landslips. In September 1880, a cyclone caused much damage from landslips and floods. In the Bhut mah\u00e1ls, avalanches are always threatening the safety of villages and of travellers, and laden cattle and sheep are sometimes over-\nwhelmed in the passes; but no great disaster has yet occurred requiring special notice. On an average of five years, 58 persons have perished yearly in Kum\u00e1un from the attacks of wild animals and snake-bites; while the record of a single year shows the destruction of 45 tigers, 124 leopards, and 240 bears, at a cost of \u00a3146 in Government rewards.\n\nManufactures, Commerce, etc. \u2014 If we except tea prepared on the European plantations, there are no manufactures of any note. The people of the northern tracts, who use woollen clothing, weave a coarse kind of serge. The trade of Kum\u00e1un may be described under two heads \u2014 first, that in the hands of the Bhotiyas with Tibet; and, secondly, that with the plains. The Tibet trade is almost a complete monopoly in the hands of its carriers. The imports are ponies, y\u00e1ks, sheep, salt, borax, gold, wool, drugs, precious stones, y\u00e1k tails, coarse woollen cloth, and Chinese silks. The exports are grain, cotton goods, broad-cloth, quilts, hardware, tobacco, sugar, spices, dyes, tea, and wood for house-building. In the year 1876\u201377, imports via Juh\u00e1r were valued at \u00a312,600, and exports at \u00a34100; imports via D\u00e1rma and By\u00e1us at \u00a38500, and exports at \u00a35500 in value. No later statistics are available.\n\nKum\u00e1un sends to the plains grain of sorts, clarified butter, tea, ginger, turmeric, red pepper, potatoes, hill drugs and spices, bark for tanning, pine-tar, honey and wax, and a little iron and copper, besides the timber and wild jungle produce of the bh\u00e1bhar. Its imports comprise every article of necessity or luxury, both for Europeans and natives, which the hills themselves do not furnish. Trade has of late much improved, owing to the increase of markets and the improvement in communications. The roads in the hills are for the most part only bridle-paths, more or less well laid out, but all now well bridged, English iron suspension bridges having superseded the old native rope jhulas over the larger rivers. Cart-roads run from Haldw\u00e1ni to N\u00e1ini T\u00e1l, and from R\u00e1mnagar to R\u00e1n\u00edkhet and Almora, the latter penetrating into the very heart of the District. Total length of made roads in 1882\u201383, 1402 miles. Among the resources of Kum\u00e1un, which may be further developed, are the mineral and metallic products. At Dechauri in the bh\u00e1bhar, experiments are being carried on with a view to the profitable working of the tertiary iron-ores, in the vicinity of forest fuel.\n\nAdministration. \u2014 The public revenue under the native rulers was derived from a variety of sources besides land produce, most of which were given up at the conquest by the British. Traill's land assessments were for short periods; Batten's Settlement in 1846 was for twenty years; Beckett's existing Settlement is for thirty years, and is the first based on a regular survey. Though it has produced a large increase\nof the Government demand, its incidence on the land is light, the average rate being Rs. 1. 3. 11, or about 2s. 5\u00bdd., per cultivated bisi or local acre, and Rs. 0. 13. 10 per bisi on total cultivated and cultivable area. The total revenue of Kum\u00e1un District, in 1882-83, was \u00a368,585, of which \u00a325,374 was derived from the land. Total cost of officials and police of all kinds, \u00a313,874. For the collection of the revenue, as well as for general duty, 2 tahsild\u00e1irs are stationed at Almora and Champ\u00e1wat. They are assisted by local patw\u00e1ris, a peculiar class of mixed fiscal and judicial petty officers, each of whom has charge of one or more pattis, paid chiefly from a cess of 4 per cent. on the land revenue. Besides this cess, there is a District d\u00e1k or post-office cess of 3 per cent. in lieu of personal service, and a school cess to provide vernacular education. A small tax of from 1 to 3 rupees (2s. to 6s.) is levied on village water-mills for grinding corn. There are police stations at Almora, N\u00e1ini T\u00e1l, R\u00e1n\u00edkhet, Champ\u00e1wat, and Shor, within the hills, and at R\u00e1mnagar, K\u00e1ladh\u00fangi, Haldw\u00e1ni, and Barmdeo in the bh\u00e1bhar, where protection is required at the mand\u00eds or marts. There is a jail at Almora, but crime in Kum\u00e1un is, generally speaking, light.\n\nThe Civil Courts, presided over by the European staff and 2 native subordinate judges, have a simple procedure, resembling that of our county courts, and deal with a rather excessive amount of petty litigation, chiefly connected with land. The language used is Hindi, written in the N\u00e1gari character, and well known to the suitors.\n\nClimate, etc.\u2014With the exception of the bh\u00e1bhar and deep valleys, Kum\u00e1un on the whole enjoys a mild climate. Even at heights from 5000 feet upwards, supposed to possess a European climate, the periodical rains and atmospheric conditions preceding and following them, throw the whole southern slope of the great Himalayan chain for almost half the year into the sub-tropical rather than the temperate region. The seven months from October to April are delightful. The rainfall of the outer range, which is first struck by the monsoon, is double that of the central hills, in the average proportion of 80 inches to 40. No winter passes without snow on the higher ridges, and in some years its occurrence is universal throughout the mountain tract. Frosts, especially in the valleys, are often severe. The average death-rate for the five years ending 1881 was returned at 21\u00b725 per thousand. There are numerous Government dispensaries in the District, and the American Mission has its medical establishments also. Kum\u00e1un is occasionally visited by epidemic cholera. Leprosy, affecting 4 to 5 per 1000 persons, is most prevalent in the east of the District. There is an asylum at Almora for those suffering from this disease. Goitre and cretinism afflict a small proportion of the inhabitants, especially in the north-eastern pargan\u00e1s. The hill fevers at times exhibit the rapid and malignant features of plague. The mah\u00e1mari pestilence, which was\nformerly confined to Garhw\u00e1l, has of late years extended its ravages to Kum\u00e1un. The authorities are giving their anxious attention to sanitary measures, the total neglect and violation of which have produced among the natives fatal typhoid outbreaks. Murrains break out from time to time among the cattle. [For further information regarding Kum\u00e1un, see the Gazetteer of the North-Western Provinces, vols. x. and xi.

Lat. 17\u00b0 26' N., long. 73\u00b0 45' E.; 123 miles south-east by south of Bombay. The road leads from Kar\u00e1d in Sat\u00e1ra to Chipl\u00fan in Ratn\u00e1giri.\n\n**Kumbher (Kumher).**\u2014Town in Bhartpur (Bhurtpore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Lat. 27\u00b0 19' N., long. 77\u00b0 25' E.; 11 miles north-west of Bhartpur city. Thornton states that it was unsuccessfully besieged by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in 1754; and surrendered to the British in 1826, after the capture of Bhartpur. The town is on the high road to D\u00edg. It was founded at the beginning of last century by the chief of Jaipur, and is a small place situated in a plain, and surrounded by a mud wall and ditch. It has a large palace built by Budan Singh, which, although in a good state of preservation, is now infested by bats, and never used as a place of residence. The palace of the R\u00e1ja commands the surrounding plain, and serves as a fortress. Post-office. Population (1881) 7306. Hindus numbered 5972, and Muhammadans 1334.\n\n**Kumh\u00e1rsain.**\u2014One of the Simla Hill States, under the Government of the Punjab. Lat. 31\u00b0 6' to 31\u00b0 20' 30\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 22' to 77\u00b0 35' E. The village of Kumh\u00e1rsain is situated in lat. 31\u00b0 19' N., and long. 77\u00b0 30' E., about 40 miles east of Simla on the road to K\u00falu. Area of State, 90 square miles, containing 254 villages or hamlets, and 1445 houses. Total population (1881) 9515, namely, males 4920, and females 4595. Hindus number 9405, and Muhammadans 110. This State, formerly a feudatory of Bashahr, was declared independent after the expulsion of the G\u00farkhas in 1815. The sanad, dated\n7th February 1816, binds the chief and his heirs to render feudal service to the British Government. The R\u00e1na of Kumhr\u00e1sain, H\u00edr\u00e1l Singh, is a R\u00e1jput, born about 1850. The State pays a tribute to the British Government of \u00a3200. Estimated revenue of the chief, \u00a31200.\n\n**Kumhr\u00e1wan.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Digbij\u00e1iganj tahsil, R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli District, Oudh; bounded on the north by pargan\u00e1 Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d of Bara Banki, on the east by tahsil Mohan\u00e1lganj of Lucknow, on the south by pargan\u00e1 Hardoi, and on the west by Rokha Jais. Watered by the river N\u00e1iya. Area, 70 square miles, or 44,619 acres. Population (1869) 44,619; (1881) 35,259, namely, males 17,456, and females 17,803. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 34,034, and Muhammadans 1225. Government land revenue, \u00a33719; incidence per acre, 3s. 2\u00bdd. The chief proprietary body are Amethia R\u00e1jputs, a branch of the Cham\u00e1r Gaurs, said to be the descendants of a Gaur widow, who, at the extirpation of the Kshattriyas by the Br\u00e1hmans, found an asylum in a Cham\u00e1r's hut. The memory of this humble refuge is still kept alive by the worship of the r\u00e1pi or cobbler's cutting tool. Great numbers of the Cham\u00e1r Gaurs now hold villages in Hardoi District, and it is probable that the Amethias were an offshoot of the same immigration. Tradition discovers them first at Shiupur\u00ed and afterwards at the celebrated fortress of K\u00e1linjar. Somewhere about the time of Tamerlane's invasion of Hindust\u00e1n, R\u00e1ip\u00e1l Singh left K\u00e1linjar and settled at Amethi in Lucknow, and a branch of the family subsequently obtained Kumhr\u00e1wan. Of the 58 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1 40 are t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri, 4 zamind\u00e1ri, and 14 pattid\u00e1ri.\n\n**Kumill\u00e1.**\u2014Head-quarters town of Tipperah District, Bengal.\u2014See COMILLA.\n\n**Kumiri\u00e1.**\u2014Village and head-quarters of a police circle (th\u00e1n\u00e1) in the head-quarters Sub-division of Chittagong District, Bengal; situated near the sea-coast, on the main road from Tipperah to Chittagong, on the banks of the Kumhfra Kh\u00e1l (Crocodile Creek), from which it derives its name. Lat. 20\u00b0 30' 15\" N., long. 91\u00b0 45' 40\" E.\n\n**Kuml\u00e1grah.**\u2014Fortress in Mandi State, Punjab; situated in lat. 31\u00b0 48' N., and long. 76\u00b0 43' E., near the south bank of the Beas (B\u00eds\u00e1); consisting of a range of forts, about 3 miles in length, constructed partly of masonry and partly of the natural sandstone rock. The principal stronghold crowns an isolated peak, whose precipitous sides tower 1500 feet above the Beas, with double that elevation above sea-level. Sansar Chand, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of K\u00e1ngra, attacked the fortifications unsuccessfully; but General Ventura, the partisan Sikh commander, succeeded in carrying them, against the popular belief in their impregnability.\n\n**K\u00fampta** (Coompta).\u2014Sub-division of North Kanara District, Bombay Presidency. Situated along the coast, and bounded on the north by Ankola; on the east by Sirsi and Siddapur; on the south by\nHon\u00e1war; and on the west by the Arabian Sea. Area, 230 square miles. Population (1881) 58,758, namely, 29,088 males and 29,670 females; density of population, 255'4 persons per square mile; number of towns, 2; villages, 115; houses, 9803. Hindus number 55,010, or 93 per cent.; Muhammadans, 2099, or 3'5 per cent.; 'others,' 1649.\n\nThe coast-line, beginning south of the Gang\u00e1wali river, consists of long stretches of sand, fringed with cocoa-nut gardens, crossed by frequent rocky highlands and headlands, and by tidal creeks. Eight to twelve miles inland the hills are clothed with forest, which becomes denser as the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills are approached. Near the coast is a belt of rice land; beyond is the central plain occupied by rice and sugar-cane; inland, rice gives place to r\u00e1gi. Water is plentiful. The soil is sandy and red loam. Products, cocoa-nuts, rice, areca-nuts, pepper, sugar-cane, and pulses. The whole Sub-division has been brought under the Bombay Survey Settlement. Average rainfall for ten years ending 1879, 132'4 inches; in one year, 1877, 201 inches fell. Agricultural stock in 1881\u201382\u2014Horned cattle, 28,317; horses, 11; sheep and goats, 253; ploughs, 4900; carts, 146. In 1883, the Sub-division contained 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 3; with a regular police force of 43, and a village watch of 22 men. Land revenue (1881\u201382), \u00a312,122.\n\nK\u00fampta (Coompta).\u2014Chief town of the K\u00fampta Sub-division, K\u00e1nara District, Bombay Presidency; situated on the sea-coast, on the north side of the K\u00fampta creek, one mile east of the lighthouse, and about 113 miles north of Mangalore, and 40 miles south of K\u00e1rw\u00e1r. Lat. 14\u00b0 26' N., and long. 74\u00b0 27' E. Population (1881) 10,629, namely, 5571 males and 5058 females. Hindus numbered 9189; Muhammadans, 705; Christians, 679; and Jains, 56. Municipal income (1880\u201381), \u00a31163, or 2s. 1\u00bdd. per head.\n\nK\u00fampta, though an open roadstead, is a place of large trade, owing to the roads which connect it with the cotton marts of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r; but it is expected that this traffic will be much affected by the new railway which is to have its terminus at Marmagao, in Portuguese territory. The lighthouse, in lat. 14\u00b0 25' N., and long. 74\u00b0 23' E., is 6 miles to the north of Fortified Island, and consists of a white masonry column or tower, 60 feet high, erected on a hill 120 feet in elevation, and about half a mile to the east of the rocky cliffs of K\u00fampta point. It exhibits a fixed white light, at an elevation of 180 feet above sea-level, which is visible at the distance of 9 miles from the deck of a ship in clear weather. This light overlooks the mouth of the creek which leads boats at high water up to the cotton warehouse on the south side of the town.\n\nK\u00fampta seems to have been formerly a place of some note. Its lanes are straight and fenced with stone walls, and it has many\ncocoa-nut gardens. Twice it had the misfortune of having Tip\u00fb's army encamped in its vicinity, and on both occasions it was burned down by some of the irregulars. The town contains a sub-judge's court, a telegraph office, a post-office, a school, and a dispensary, and is the head-quarters station of the chief revenue and police officers of the Sub-division. Its trade consists chiefly of cotton, spices, and grain, the first coming from Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, and the rest from the upland country of K\u00e1nara. The only manufacture is the carving of a few articles of sandal-wood, which are exported to Bombay. K\u00fampta port is one of the seven ports which make up the Hon\u00e1war Customs Division. The average value of imports at K\u00fampta port alone for the five years ending 1881\u201382 was \u00a3269,754, and of exports \u00a3570,878. In 1881\u201382, the imports were valued at \u00a3219,415, and the exports at \u00a3636,299.\n\nKun\u00e1w\u00e1r (Kan\u00e1w\u00e1r).\u2014The upper or north-eastern Sub-division of Bashahr (Bassahir) State, Punjab, consisting in great part of the valley of the Upper Sutlej. Lat. 31\u00b0 16' to 32\u00b0 3' N., and long. 77\u00b0 33' to 79\u00b0 2' E.; bounded on the north by Spiti, on the east by Chinese territory, on the south by Bashahr Proper and Garhw\u00e1l, and on the west by the Kochi Sub-division of Bashahr. Estimated area, 1730 square miles. Population (1881) 14,315.\n\nKun\u00e1w\u00e1r consists of a rugged country, 50 miles in length by 40 in breadth, through whose ridges winds the deeply cleft valley of the Sutlej. The precipitous banks of the central river afford little room for cultivation; but the valleys of its tributaries are assiduously tilled by the mountaineers. The chief of these are\u2014the Li or river of Spiti, the D\u00e1rbang, the P\u00edjar, the Koch\u00e1ng, the Malgin, the V\u00e1l\u00e1, the Wangar, and the Keuncha, which flow into the Sutlej on the right side; and the Hocho, the Tughlagkhur, the Tidang, the Baspa, the Panwi, the Soldang, and the Kundala, which enter from the left. The Sutlej, which forms everywhere the centre of depression, has an elevation of about 10,000 feet on the north-eastern border, falling to about 4000 feet as it passes out of Kun\u00e1w\u00e1r on the south-west. The lower valley has a warm climate, rendered oppressively hot in summer by radiation from the rocks. The monsoon reaches only the southern extremity of Kun\u00e1w\u00e1r, so that the autumn rains do not extend to the upper half, which depends almost entirely for its water-supply upon artificial irrigation from the hill streams. The winter is rigorous, and snow often blocks up and isolates the higher villages for considerable periods together. Nevertheless, until about twenty-five years ago, grapes yielded an abundant vintage, being manufactured into raisin wine and strong spirit. The prevalence of vine disease has, however, seriously affected the vintage of the country. Its attacks are supposed by the people to have been provoked by the wrath of the local goddess Bh\u00eem Kall of Ser\u00e1-\nhan, who was offended by the attempt of a European to manufacture wine or spirit at Chini.\n\nThe population consists of a mixed Tibetan and Hindu race, the Turanian element preponderating in the north, while the southern region is inhabited by persons of Aryan type. In physique, the Kunawaris are tall, athletic, well made, and dark-skinned; while their character stands high for hospitality, truthfulness, and honesty. Alone among the neighbouring hill tribes, they successfully resisted the Gurkha invasion, and so completely baffled the enemy by breaking down bridges, that the Gurkhas entered into a convention by which, in return for a tribute of \u00a3750 per annum, they agreed to leave the valley unmolested. Polyandry everywhere exists in its fullest form.\n\nThe religion of the Kunawaris shows the same mixed origin as its ethnical peculiarities. The northern villages profess Buddhism of the Tibetan model; in the south, Hinduism prevails, while the middle region shades off gradually from one faith into the other, producing grotesque mixtures of ceremonial and belief. Brahmins do not live beyond Serahan, near the southern frontier; at Kanum, half-way across the tract, the Tibetan sacred books are in use, and lamas are found, but the Hindu veneration for kine still exists, and the distinctions of caste survive; while at Hang-rang, on the northern frontier, Buddhism assumes the pure Tibetan form. The language shades off, like the religion, from Tibetan in the north to neo-Sanskritic dialects on the Indian side. The chief villages in the valley are Sangnam and Kanum.\n\nKunch.\u2014South-western tahsil of Jalalun District, North-Western Provinces; consisting of a level plain, much cut up by ravines along the Pahuj river on its western border, and irrigated by the inundation known as pauh from the Samthar State on the south. The tahsil is thickly populated, and said to be better cultivated than any other tract in the District. Area, 209 square miles, of which 168 are under cultivation. Population (1872) 67,041; (1881) 71,429, namely, males 36,246, and females 35,183; the total increase during the nine years being 4388, or 6\u00b75 per cent. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 67,035, and Muhammadans, 4394. Of the 216 villages comprising the tahsil, 162 contained less than five hundred inhabitants. Land revenue, \u00a322,484; total Government revenue, \u00a325,268; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a340,013; corrected rental, \u00a349,663; incidence of Government revenue per acre, 3s. 4\u00bdd. Communication is afforded by the metalled roads from Jhansi to Phaphund railway station in Etawah District, and from Kunch to Urai, as well as by several fair-weather roads. In 1883 the tahsil contained 2 civil and 2 criminal courts; number of police circles (than\u00e1s), 5; with a regular police force of 46, and a village watch of 186 men.\n\nKunch.\u2014Municipal town in Jalalun District, North-Western Pro-\nvinces, and head-quarters of K\u00fanch tahsil. Lat. 25\u00b0 59' 36\" N., and long. 79\u00b0 1' 55\" E. The town stands on the open plain, distant from Ur\u00e1i 19 miles west, from K\u00e1lpi 42 miles south-west. Population (1872) 14,448; (1881) 13,739, namely, males 6749, and females 6990. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 11,216 in 1881, and Muhammadans 2523. Area of town site, 795 acres. The town consists of a business end to the east, and of a quiet, straggling, country village to the west. A large tank, known as Govind R\u00e1o's T\u00e1l, built about 1750, is adorned with steps on all sides, and a cupola at each corner, but it contains no water during the dry season. Cotton and wheat market; market for molasses, rice, and tobacco; salt market. Narrow, tortuous, unmade, undrained b\u00e1z\u00e1r lanes, with poor-looking and often ruinous shops. Surface much intersected by ravines and water-courses. Declining trade and population; insufficient communications.\n\nIn 1804, Colonel Fawcett, commanding British troops in Bundelkhand, sent a force to reduce a neighbouring fort. Am\u00edr Kh\u00e1n, then plundering Mau and Irichh, attacked them unexpectedly, and drove them back to their camp with considerable loss. The freebooting chief next plundered K\u00e1lpi and Ata; but K\u00fanch was saved by the remains of the British force. Shortly afterwards, the British troops under Colonel Shepherd dispersed the marauding body. During the Mutiny of 1857, the rebels under Barjor Singh frequently occupied K\u00fanch. Residence of an extra-Assistant Commissioner; tahsili, police station, tahsili school, girls' school, Government charitable dispensary. Municipal revenue in 1875-76, \u00a3805; in 1882-83, \u00a3722, of which \u00a3626 was derived from octroi; incidence of taxation, 10\u00bdd. per head of the town population.\n\nKund.\u2014Valley in Kashm\u00edr State, Northern India.\u2014See KHUND.\n\nKundada-betta.\u2014Peak in the Kiggatnad t\u00e1luk of Coorg. Distant 4 miles from H\u00e1t\u00far, on the Mysore-Cannanore road. On the summit is a small stone temple dedicated to Iswara or Siva, repaired in 1853; standing on the edge of a precipice 500 feet high. A festival or j\u00e1ttra is annually held here.\n\nK\u00fand\u00e1hs.\u2014Range of mountains in Nilgiri District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 11\u00b0 9' to 11\u00b0 21' 40\" N., and long. 76\u00b0 27' 50\" to 76\u00b0 46' E. The western wall of the Nilgiri plateau, rising abruptly from Malabar. The summit of the ridge is rocky and precipitous; and the sides, covered at places with grass, slope down to the valley of the K\u00fand\u00e1h river, which separates this range from the rest of the table-land. The three highest points are Avalanche Peak, 8502 feet; Bear Hill, 8353 feet; and Mak\u00farti, 8402 feet. The ground is broken, and tea-planting is less developed than in the rest of the District. From Ut\u00e1kamand (Ootacamund) the view of the K\u00fand\u00e1h range is remarkably beautiful. The Bhav\u00e1ni river rises in this range, and Government have\nrecently reserved all the remaining woodlands with the view of maintaining the rain-supply.

Celebrated for its deep lake known as K\u00e1l\u00e1 Kund. A bandh or masonry dam, placed across one end of the lake by a late R\u00e1j\u00e1 of the State, has enabled its waters to be used extensively for irrigation.\n\n**Kund\u00e1pur.**\u2014Town and river, South K\u00e1nara District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See KANDAPUR.\n\n**Kundhnan Khurd.**\u2014Town in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Oudh.\u2014See KANDARKA KHURD.\n\n**Kundia.**\u2014Village in the Native State of Udaipur, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na.

The country is a perfect network of small streams, which annually overflow their banks during the rains, causing considerable damage. Area, 164\u00bc square miles, or 105,507 acres, of which 67,983 acres are cultivated, 17,695 acres are cultivable, and 19,829 acres are uncultivable waste. Population (1869) 69,584; (1881) 71,161, namely, males 37,288, and females 33,873. The incidence of the land revenue is at the rate of rs. 3\u00bdd. per acre of total area, rs. 8\u00bcd. per acre of assessed area, and 2s. 1\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area. The villages number 129, of which 66 are held on t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r\u00ed and 63 on zamind\u00e1r\u00ed tenure. R\u00e1jputs hold 92 villages, Musalm\u00e1ns 26, Government 7, and Br\u00e1hmans, K\u00e1yasths, Baniy\u00e1s, and Bh\u00e1ts, 1 each. In ancient times, the inhabitants were Bhars, Kurm\u00eds, and Raghubansi. Local tradition relates that about 700 years ago two R\u00e1jput brothers, B\u00e1il and S\u00e1l, came from their native town of Raik\u00e1 in Jamu, and drove out the Bhars. B\u00e1il and S\u00e1l divided the country, the former taking the northern parts, and the latter the southern. The descend-\nants of both are extant to the present day, and are known as Raikw\u00e1r R\u00e1jputs, from the name of the original village of their ancestors. The descendants of S\u00e1l are chiefly found in R\u00e1mnagar pargan\u00e1, Bara Banki District; and those of B\u00e1l, in Kundri and in Bahr\u00e1ich. In Kundri, the chief Raikw\u00e1r proprietors were the Raj\u00e1 of Chahl\u00e1ri, who was slain in the Mutiny and his estates confiscated, the R\u00e1o of Mall\u00e1pur, and the Th\u00e1kur of R\u00e1mpur.\n\n**Kundri, South.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Siddhauli tahsil, S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh; forming, together with North Kundri, the do\u00e1b or alluvial valley between the Chauka and the Gogra, and liable to destructive inundations.

Population (1869) 29,393; (1881) 26,516, namely, males 14,259, and females 12,257. The incidence of the land revenue is at the rate of 1s. 1d. per acre of total area, 1s. 4\u00bdd. per acre of assessed area, and 1s. 9d. per acre of cultivated area. The villages number 39, of which 27 are held by a Raikw\u00e1r t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r.\n\n**Kunh\u00e1r** (also called Nainsukh).\u2014River in Haz\u00e1ra District, Punjab; draining the whole of the Kh\u00e1g\u00e1n valley. Rises in lat. 34\u00b0 51' N., and long. 74\u00b0 4' E., in lake Lohusur, at the head of the Kh\u00e1g\u00e1n glen, and after a course of about 100 miles, joins the Jehlam (Jhelum) at Patan, in lat. 34\u00b0 17' N., and long. 73\u00b0 31' E. Narrow and rocky bed; as far as Bal\u00e1kot, extremely tortuous. Mountains from 8000 to 16,700 feet in height hem it in on either side, the basin between rarely exceeding 16 miles in width, and contracting in its lower portion, where the hills subside, to 8 miles or less. Above Bal\u00e1kot, the torrent flows so fiercely that nothing can live in it; below that point, the stream may be crossed by swimming during the summer months, and sometimes even becomes fordable. One of the main roads to Kashm\u00edr runs through the Batr\u00e1si and D\u00fab Passes, on the western and eastern banks respectively, and crosses the Kunh\u00e1r at Garhi Habib-ull\u00e1 by a suspension bridge, with a span of 108 feet, erected in 1856 at a cost of \u00a3798. Below this bridge, rough suspension bridges of rope, manufactured from twisted twigs, cross the river at long intervals.\n\n**Kunhi\u00e1r.**\u2014One of the Simla Hill States, under the political superintendence of the Government of the Punjab. Lat. 31\u00b0 3' to 31\u00b0 7' N., and long. 76\u00b0 59' to 77\u00b0 3' E. The area is 8 square miles, and the population in 1881 was returned at 1923. The little State occupies a fertile valley about 15 miles west of Simla. The climate is very mild, and the soil fertile, producing good crops of sugar-cane. The Th\u00e1kur of Kunhi\u00e1r, Tegh Singh, is a Raghubansi R\u00e1jput, born about 1834. The family has the title of R\u00e1o, and within the last two generations has taken the suffix Singh. The founder of the family, Bhaj Deo, who came from Jamu, conquered and held this petty State at a date unknown. The\nsanad of the chiefship is dated 4th September 1815, after the expulsion of the G\u00farkhas. It contains the usual terms of vassalage. The annual revenue of the chief is estimated at \u00a3400. The State pays a tribute of \u00a318 to the British Government.\n\nKun\u00ed.\u2014River rising in the Yeotm\u00e1l range of hills, W\u00fan District, Ber\u00e1r.

The fort is said to have been founded by a local chief in 1290. It is said to derive its name from a 'dancing stone' (kunigallu), Siva having danced here. A large tank has been constructed at the junction of three hill streams. In recent years, a low type of fever has made the place very unhealthy. An important establishment for breeding horses for the Mysore silli\u00e1rs. Head-quarters of the Kunigal t\u00e1luk.\n\nKunjah.\u2014Town and municipality in Gujr\u00e1t tahsil, Gujr\u00e1t District, Punjab, 7 miles north-west of Gujr\u00e1t town.

Salt station, yielding a revenue of about \u00a315,000 per annum.\n\n**Kur\u00e1i.**\u2014North-western tahsil or Sub-division of S\u00e1gar (Saugor) District, Central Provinces. Area, 936 square miles, with 1 town and 482 villages; number of houses, 26,332. Population (1881) 116,767, namely, males 61,440, and females 55,327; average density, 124\u00b775 persons per square mile. Total adult agricultural population, 34,844, or 29\u00b78 per cent. of the entire population of the tahsil. Average area of cultivated and cultivable land, 13 acres per head. Of the total area of 936 square miles, 190 square miles are held revenue free, and 746 square miles are assessed for Government revenue. Of the assessed area, 358 square miles are returned as cultivated, 282 square miles as cultivable, and 106 square miles as uncultivable waste. Total Government revenue, including local rates and cesses levied on land, \u00a311,174, or an average of 11\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total rental paid by cultivators, \u00a327,324, or 2s. 2\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. In 1883, the tahsil contained 1 criminal and 2 civil courts; number of police stations, 3, with 15 outposts; strength of regular police, 139 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 405.\n\n**Kur\u00e1i.**\u2014Town in S\u00e1gar (Saugor) District, Central Provinces, and head-quarters of Kur\u00e1i tahsil. Lat. 24\u00b0 2' 30\" N., long. 78\u00b0 22' 30\" E.; 34 miles north-west of S\u00e1gar town. From the Gaul\u00eds Kur\u00e1i passed to the Muhammadan rulers of Delhi. Aurangzeb united the pargan\u00e1 of Kur\u00e1i with that of Garol\u00e1, and gave the tract in j\u00e1g\u00edr to a D\u00e1ngi chief, who built the fort. In 1753, Govind Pandit, on behalf of the Peshw\u00e1, took possession of Kur\u00e1i. He enlarged the fort, and dug a large well within it; and built on its south-west side a temple, still in good preservation, isolating the whole by water from a lake he had excavated. The fort consists of round towers connected by curtain walls, and\nencloses 11 acres. Within it stands the tahsil court-house, also built by Govind Pandit.\n\nKur\u00e1i formed part of the country ceded by the Peshw\u00e1 to the British in 1818. In July 1857, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bh\u00e1npur invested Kur\u00e1i, on which the tahsild\u00e1r surrendered the fort and joined the rebels. They held the place till February 1858, when Sir Hugh Rose defeated the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bh\u00e1npur at Barodi\u00e1 Naw\u00e1nagar. The ravages of the rebels greatly depressed the country round Kur\u00e1i; but since the new Settlement, marked improvement has taken place.\n\nThe town is well laid out, with wide streets, and substantial houses. North of the fort are some handsome Hindu temples. Large quantities of cattle are brought to the weekly markets, chiefly from the Native State of Gwalior; and the whole of the meat supplied by the commissariat to the European troops at S\u00e1g\u00e1r, Jabalpur (Jubbulpore), and Nowgong comes from Kur\u00e1i. The town has a police station-house, a post-office, and 3 schools, one being for girls. Population (1872) 4965; (1881) 5370, chiefly D\u00e1ng\u00eds, a class of agricultural R\u00e1jputs. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 3856; Jains, 745; Sikhs, 101; Muhammadans, 665; and Christians, 3. Municipal income (1882\u201383) \u00a31090, of which \u00a3571 was derived from taxation, principally octroi; average incidence of taxation, 2s. 1\u00bdd. per head.\n\n**Kuram.**\u2014A district of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, consisting of the valley of the river Kuram as far as British territory. The length of the district, until 1880 a sub-division of K\u00e1b\u00fal Province, is about 60 miles, and its breadth varies from 3 to 10 miles.\n\nThe scenery is exceedingly fine, and in some places grand, the Safed Koh forming a magnificent background to a picture of quiet beauty. The Kuram river runs through green fields and sunny orchards, and numerous villages dot the plain. The principal spur from the Safed Koh range is the Peiw\u00e1r ridge, which runs south and divides into two branches, one of which is parallel to the Kuram. The other rivers of the district are the Hariab, Keria, Mangal, Ahmad Khel, Kirm\u00e1n, and Karamana. The chief tribes inhabiting the Kuram valley are the Bangash, T\u00far\u00ed, J\u00e1j\u00ed, and Mangal. The two last, who are semi-independent, inhabit the upper portion of the district towards the crest of the Peiw\u00e1r Kotal, and south of Chamkan\u00ed. The numbers of these tribes are thus estimated:\n\n| Tribe     | Estimated Number |\n|-----------|------------------|\n| Mangals   | at 8,000 fighting men, by Lumsden. |\n| J\u00e1jis     | ,, 800 ,,        |\n| Bangash   | ,, 5,620 ,,      |\n| T\u00faris     | ,, 5,000 ,,      |\n\nTotal, 19,420 fighting men.\n\nThe total number of inhabitants has been estimated at 77,680.\nAlthough Kuram lies in the midst of an Afgh\u00e1n population, all its tribes belong to the Shi\u00e1 sect.\n\nThe chief crops of Kuram are rice, cotton, barley, and j\u00f3r. Apples, pomegranates, melons, quinces, and other fruits are also grown. Water is abundant everywhere, and irrigation is rendered easy by the presence of the Kuram and the numerous hill torrents which feed it. A large unirrigated tract in the north is known as the M\u00e1id\u00e1n. All the irrigated lands in the district lie close to the banks of the Kuram; and whenever these fields are flooded, it is a common practice to plant rows of willows as thickly as they will stand, and keep them cut down to 2 or 3 feet in height for some years. These spreading form a complete barrier, which in ordinary floods catches and retains rich deposits of alluvial soil, on which as soon as it is dry, a crop is sown, while each succeeding flood only adds to the depth of the deposit. Thus the cultivator only loses one crop, and in a very few years regains a fine field supported on a living wall of willows.\n\nThe slopes of the Safed Koh range are clothed with pine forests, and the timber is floated down the Kuram to Bannu for the use of the British Forest Department.\n\nThe route through the Kuram valley is perhaps the best of all the roads between Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n and the Punjab, both on account of its easiness and the abundance of water, fuel, etc. procurable.\n\nThe number of villages in Kuram is 36; the largest contains a population of about 1000. The fort of the governor is at Ahmadz\u00e1i.\n\nThe following particulars are given by General Macgregor (from Major Plowden's compilation) as to the administration of Kuram. The district was formerly divided in 29 sub-divisions, each of 720 acres, the whole paying an aggregate land-tax of \u00a36250. The miscellaneous revenue is raised by a poll-tax on Hindus, each male adult paying a sum of about 6s.; by taxes on animals sold; and by transit duties. The T\u00faris are great traders, and own a large stock of pack-mules; there are no camels or pack-bullocks in Kuram. Fruit, rice, and d\u00e1l are brought down to British territory, the traders lading Koh\u00e1t salt for the return journey. Hab\u00edf-Kala in Peiw\u00e1r is the chief centre of trade. The customs of the people do not differ materially from those of other parts of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n. In cases of murder, blood is either taken for blood, or \u00a336 and a bride (valued at \u00a318) are accepted as compensation. Peace is not held to be complete until a bride has been given. Semi-military and police posts are\u2014Kapi\u00e1n, Ahmadi-Shama, Balesh Khel, Fort Kuram, and Peiw\u00e1r.\n\nThe Kuram valley is historical as the starting-point of General Roberts' expedition in the war between England and Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, 1878-79. On the 11th of September in the latter year, the murder of our envoy Sir Louis Cavagnari was followed by General Roberts'\nseizure of the Shutargardan pass, and an advance by the Kuram route to K\u00e1b\u00fal.\n\n**Kuram.**\u2014River in Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n and Bannu District, Punjab; rises in the Safed Koh mountains beyond the frontier, and, before reaching British territory, waters the fertile Kuram valley in the independent hills. Then it rushes through the mountains held by various Waz\u00edr\u00ed clans, and entering Bannu District at its north-west corner, 5 miles from the cantonment and civil station, finally falls into the Indus some 4 miles south of Is\u00e1khel, after receiving the waters of the Tochi a few miles east of Lakki, in lat. $32^\\circ 37'$ N., and long. $71^\\circ 22'$ E.\n\nThe rich deposits brought down by the Kuram render its waters peculiarly valuable for irrigation, but unwholesome for drinking. The Bannuchis, however, draw their whole domestic supply from this source. Immediately below the hills, boulders line the shallow bed; farther down, the stream cuts itself a deep channel through the yielding banks of clay; while near the Indus it loses its force, and widens out over a spreading and ill-defined basin. Throughout its course in British territory, it is used for irrigation, and a large area is constantly flooded by means of side-cuts; so much so that but little water reaches the Indus, except during the rainy season. The depth varies from 2 feet in the dry months to 6 or 7 feet in the floods. In its diagonal course of about 60 miles through Bannu District, the Kuram falls fully 700 feet. It is subject to sudden and prolonged freshes; and being nowhere yet bridged, crossing is sometimes impossible for several days at a time. During the Afghan campaign a military detachment has been known to be detained on the bank a week, unable to reach the cantonment a mile distant on the opposite side of the river. Between June and September, the only tolerably safe and practicable ford for laden camels is that opposite the cantonment. A bridge at this point is the great commercial and military want of Bannu District. In parts, however, quicksands render the passage difficult or dangerous. Bannu District owes almost all its fertility to the Kuram and its tributary the Gambila (Tochi). Area annually irrigated, about 60,000 acres.\n\n**Kurambran\u00e1d.**\u2014T\u00e1luk or Sub-division of Malabar District, Madras Presidency. Area, 408 square miles.

Remarkable for the number of temples in its vicinity, among them a very fine new one dedicated to Siva, and containing a colossal representation of the bull Nandi, a monolith. Village school.\n\n**Kurukshetra.**\u2014Holy tract and place of pilgrimage in Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umballa) and Karn\u00e1l Districts, Punjab; embracing the country lying west and south-west of the town of Th\u00e1nesar as its centre. The name derives its origin from Kuru, the ancestor alike of the Kauravas and P\u00e1ndavas who figure in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata. Kuru became an ascetic upon the banks of the holy lake south of Th\u00e1nesar; but the limits of the sacred tract cannot be exactly ascertained. According to popular belief, the Kurukshetra embraces 360 places of pilgrimage, and extends as far as the town of Jind, 64 miles from Th\u00e1nesar;\nthough General Cunningham believes that modern Br\u0101hmans have unduly enlarged its boundaries to gratify the Sikh R\u00e1j\u00e1 of J\u00ednd, whose territories are thus included within the holy borders. Whatever be the precise extent of the sacred tract, it is certain that the strip of country between the Saraswat\u00ed (Sarsuti) and the Ghaggar (the Saraswat\u00ed and Drishadvati of the Sanskrit epics) formed the original home of the Hindu faith, the earliest settlement of the Aryan colonists in India. Here their religion first assumed its present form; and therefore the Kurukshetra and the river Saraswati still attract worshippers from the remotest parts of Bengal.\n\nThe ancient capital of Kurukshetra was Srughna, the site of which has been identified by General Cunningham with the village of Sugh, situated in a bend of the old bed of the Jumna, close to Jag\u00e1dhri and Bur\u00edya. Srughna is mentioned by Hiuen Tsiang, the Chinese pilgrim of the 7th century, as a town $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in circuit, the capital of a kingdom, and the seat of considerable learning, both Buddhistic and Br\u0101hmanical. He describes the kingdom of Srughna as extending to the mountains on the north, and to the Ganges on the east, with the Jumna flowing through the centre.\n\nThe towns of Th\u00e1nesar and Pihoia are the chief centres of pilgrimage, but minor shrines line the bank of the river for many miles. At Th\u00e1nesar, as many as 100,000 persons sometimes assemble on the occasion of an eclipse of the sun, and treble that number bathe annually in a tank filled from the Sarsuti (Saraswati). The great conflict between the P\u00e1ndavas and the Kauravas was fought out in the surrounding country; and the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata keeps alive the memory of all the most famous scenes in the minds of Hindu votaries, who regard the Kurukshetra as the Holy Land of their religion.\n\nKurumba.\u2014A primitive tribe of South India, Madras Presidency. The Kurumbas are believed to have sprung from a race of nomadic shepherds, one of the great Dravidian family which inhabited the Peninsula of South India before the historical period. They founded a powerful kingdom, known as Kuramba-bh\u00fami, occupying the tract along the sea-coast from the Penn\u00e1r to the P\u00e1l\u00e1r rivers, and extending inland to the Western Gh\u00e1ts. This kingdom was finally overthrown by Adondai, the illegitimate son of Kulattungi Chola; and the conquered country passed thenceforth by the name of Tondamandalam. The power of the Kurumbas probably survived longest in the North Karn\u00e1tik, particularly in the hills. The Kurumbas themselves have lost all traces of their ancient civilisation, and retain no recollection of their previous history. At the present day they are a tribe of shepherds, scattered through the Districts of Malabar, Coimbatore, Cuddapah, Bellary, Tanjore, Trichinopoli, the Nilgiris, Mysore,\nand Pudukota State. The Census of 1881 returned the total number of Kurumbas throughout the whole of Southern India as only 3801, of whom as many as 3601 were found in the petty State of Pudukota. The Kurumbas in the British Districts and Mysore were apparently enumerated among the low-caste Hindus.\n\nThe Kurumbas are small in stature, uncouth, and squalid. They wear their hair matted and straggling, sometimes tied into a knot with a piece of cord on the crown or back of the head, with the ends hanging down. The men have scarcely any moustache or whiskers, and only a scanty beard. Their clothing consists of a piece of cloth passed between their legs. Some of the women wear a square cloth which reaches from the arm to the knee; others have only a waist-cloth. The Kurumbas profess to worship Siva, and occasionally the women mark their forehead with the Siva spot. The tribe has no special ceremonies or rites at birth or marriage. The dead are burned, and the ashes are left to be scattered by the wind. Mr. Metz describes the language as a corruption of K\u00e1narese, with T\u00e1mil words intermixed. Dr. Caldwell, however, speaks of it as \u2018rude T\u00e1mil.\u2019 The Mysore Kurumbas speak old K\u00e1narese.\n\n**Kurundw\u00e1d.** \u2014 Native State under the Political Agency of the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Country, Bombay Presidency. This State at present consists of two divisions, one belonging to the elder ruler of Kurundw\u00e1d, and the other to the younger chiefs. The elder division comprises two towns, Kurundw\u00e1d and Tikota, and 37 villages. Of these, Tikota and Wadeg\u00e1on\u2014the former in Kal\u00e1dg\u00ed, and the latter in S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District\u2014are quite isolated from the main j\u00e1gir, of which 25 villages lie close to and south of the town of Belgaum, while the remaining 10 lie in the valley of the Kistna intermixed with British territory and with the territory of the Kolh\u00e1pur, S\u00e1ngli, and M\u00faraj States. The junior division comprises 34 villages, 17 in the neighbourhood of and mostly to the south of Belgaum, 15 on the borders of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions and to the east of Shol\u00e1pur District, and 2 within the limits of the Kolh\u00e1pur State.\n\nThe elder chief\u2019s estate contains an area of 182 square miles, and a population (1881) of 35,187 persons, namely, 17,636 males and 17,551 females, occupying 6577 houses. Hindus numbered 28,558; Muhammadans, 3409; and \u2018others,\u2019 3220. The staple products are millet, rice, wheat, gram, and cotton. Coarse country cloth and articles of native female apparel are the principal manufactures. The Kurundw\u00e1d State was a grant made before 1772 by the Peshw\u00e1 to a member of the Patwardhan family, on condition of military service. In 1811 the State was divided, a half share being given by the Peshw\u00e1 to Ganpat R\u00e1o, the nephew of Nilkant R\u00e1o, the original grantee. In 1855 a further division of Kurundw\u00e1d was effected by\nthe British Government between Raghun\u00e1th R\u00e1o and his nephew Ganpat R\u00e1o, and younger brothers Vin\u00e1yak R\u00e1o and Trimbak R\u00e1o. The latter dying in 1869 without male issue, the whole of his share of the j\u00e1gir was bestowed on the two younger chiefs, with the exception of the share he possessed in the in\u00e1m estate, which reverted to the elder chief. The total yearly tribute received by the British Government from Kurundw\u00e1d amounts to \u00a3961. The present (1881\u201382) senior chief is Chint\u00e1man R\u00e1o Raghun\u00e1th, a Hindu of the Brahmin caste. He is twenty-seven years of age, and administers his estate in person. The elder chief of Kurundw\u00e1d ranks as a first-class sard\u00e1r, and has power to try his own subjects for capital offences without the express permission of the Political Agent. He enjoys an estimated gross revenue of \u00a311,000, and maintains a military force of 268 men. His family hold a sanad of adoption, and the succession follows the rule of primogeniture. In 1882\u201383 there were five schools with 165 scholars, besides seven indigenous schools.\n\nThe share of the younger chiefs contains an area of 114 square miles, and a population (1881) of 25,811 persons, namely, 13,052 males and 12,759 females, occupying 3557 houses. Hindus numbered 20,632; Muhammadans, 2548; and \u2018others,\u2019 2631. The arrangement entered into by the senior branch is considered as binding upon the younger chiefs. The present (1881\u201382) head of the younger chiefs is Ganpat R\u00e1o Harihar. He is thirty-nine years of age, and administers his estate in person. He maintains a military force of 304 men, and has an estimated gross revenue (1882) of \u00a310,283. In 1882\u201383 there were two vernacular schools.\n\nKurundw\u00e1d.\u2014Chief town of the State of Kurundw\u00e1d, in the South Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Country, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 16\u00b0 41' N., long. 74\u00b0 38' E. Population (1881) 7138. Hindus numbered 5278; Muhammadans, 1064; Jains, 791; Christians, 1; and P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 4. Situated on the right bank of the P\u00e1nchgang\u00e1 river, close to its junction with the Kistna. The town is the residence of the representatives of both branches of the ruling family, and was formerly well protected, but the defences are now mostly in ruins. It has no public buildings of any interest, save the palace of the chiefs, and a temple dedicated to Vishnu. Outside the town, and distant about a mile, is a fine masonry bathing gh\u00e1t on the Kistna. The water-supply is dependent on the P\u00e1nchgang\u00e1, from which a windmill pump raises the water for the town. There is a charitable dispensary. The town is not a part of the j\u00e1gir, having been given in in\u00e1m to an ancestor of the present chiefs by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kolhap\u00far. It possesses a municipality.\n\nKurw\u00e1i.\u2014Native State under the Bhop\u00e1l Agency of Central India. Lat. 23\u00b0 21' to 24\u00b0 14' N., and long. 77\u00b0 26' to 78\u00b0 20' E. The State is situated on the river Betw\u00e1, between S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) and Sironj. Chief\nproducts, opium and grain. The founder of the principality was an Afgh\u00e1n adventurer, named Muhammad Dalel Kh\u00e1n. He first entered the service of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Datia, and afterwards, about 1726, that of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of B\u00e1soda. By dint of his valour, he became commandant of the B\u00e1soda troops; and, on the death of the chief of Kurw\u00e1i, he seized that territory, and built the fort of Kurw\u00e1i. During the decline of the Mughal Empire, the State increased greatly in consideration and prosperity. The chief rendered assistance to General Goddard in 1783, and in consequence suffered severely afterwards from the enmity of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s; in 1818 he applied to the British Resident at Bhop\u00e1l for protection, which was accorded, and thenceforward he remained undisturbed in his possessions. The chief, Muhammad Najaf Kh\u00e1n, bears the title of Naw\u00e1b. The area of the State is about 139 square miles, with a population in 1881 of 24,631, of whom 12,622 were males and 12,009 females; density of the population, 176 persons per square mile. Hindus numbered 20,788; Muhammadans, 3609; Jains, 24; and aboriginal tribes, 216. The revenue is estimated at \u00a310,000. The Naw\u00e1b keeps up a force of 40 horse and 150 infantry.\n\nKurw\u00e1i.\u2014Chief town of the Kurw\u00e1i State, under the Bhop\u00e1l Agency, Central India.

Native weapons, such as matchlocks and knives, are manufactured, and are much prized in the neighbouring villages. Dispensary and post-office. Population (1881) from 3000 to 5000.\n\nKusbhadr\u00e1.\u2014A deltaic distributary of the Koy\u00e1kh\u00e1i branch of the Mah\u00e1nadi, which, after throwing off a branch, the Pr\u00e1chi, falls into the Bay of Bengal a little south of the Kan\u00e1rak temple, in lat. 19\u00b0 51' N., and long. 86\u00b0 4' E.\n\nKushti\u00e1 (Kooshtea).\u2014Sub-division of Nadiy\u00e1 District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 42' to 24\u00b0 9' N., and long. 88\u00b0 47' to 89\u00b0 24' 45\" E. Area, 558 square miles, with 861 villages or towns, and 71,811 houses. Population (1881) 446,694, namely, males 216,617, and females 230,077; proportion of males in the total population, 48\u00b75 per cent. The most densely populated Sub-division in the District, the average density being 800 persons per square mile, or 1 to every 1\u00b725 acre; villages per square mile, 1\u00b754; persons per village, 519; houses per square mile, 133\u00b77; persons per house, 6\u00b72. This Sub-division comprises the 6 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of Daulatpur, N\u00e1opar\u00e1, Kushti\u00e1, Kum\u00e1rh\u00e1i, Bh\u00e1luk\u00e1, and Bhaduli\u00e1. In 1883 it contained 4 civil and 2 magisterial courts, a regular police force of 120 men, besides\na village watch numbering 913. The Northern Bengal State Railway, from the Eastern Bengal Railway station at Parodah to Damukdiha on the Ganges, intersects the Sub-division. The population is almost entirely agricultural, but a considerable river trade is also carried on.\n\n**Kushtia.**\u2014Town, municipality, and head-quarters of Kushtia Sub-division and police circle (th\u00e1n\u00e1) in Nadiy\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated on the right bank of the Padn\u00e1 or Ganges. Lat. $23^\\circ 54' 55''$ N., long. $89^\\circ 10' 5''$ E. Population (1872) 9245, namely, 4674 males and 4571 females; (1881) 9717, namely, males 4778, and females 4939. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Muhammadans, 5669; Hindus, 4023; \u2018others,\u2019 25. Area of town site, 3200 acres. Municipal income (1876\u201377), \u00a3279; (1883\u201384), \u00a3524; rate of municipal taxation, 1s. 0\u00bdd. per head. The principal seat of river trade in the District, and an important station on the Eastern Bengal Railway. Until the extension of the line to Go\u00e1land\u00e1 in 1870, Kushtia was the terminus of the railway, and the chief landing-place for jute and other products of Eastern Bengal. The silting up of the river, and the extension of the line eastwards down the Ganges to Go\u00e1land\u00e1 in Far\u00eddpur District, has removed much of the traffic of Kushtia to the new terminus.\n\n**Kus\u00ed (Koosy).**\u2014River of Northern Bengal, rising among the Nep\u00e1l Him\u00e1layas in lat. $28^\\circ 25'$ N., and long. $86^\\circ 11'$ E. It first takes a course south-west for about 60 miles, then south and south-east for 160 more, during which it receives on its left bank its two great tributaries the Aran and Tambar. It leaves the mountains in lat. $26^\\circ 45'$ N., and long. $87^\\circ 13'$ E., in a series of cataracts and rapids, and after a southerly course touches upon British territory in the extreme north-east of Bh\u00e1galpur District, at which point it is a large river nearly a mile wide. It here assumes the character of a deltaic stream, and runs a direct southerly course, with many bifurcations and interlacings, till, after receiving another considerable tributary on its left bank, the Ghugri, it finally falls into the left bank of the Ganges in lat. $25^\\circ 22' 15''$ N., and long. $87^\\circ 19'$ E., after a total course of about 325 miles.\n\nThe Kus\u00ed is remarkable for the rapidity of its stream, the dangerous and uncertain nature of its bed, but chiefly for its constant westerly movement and the desolation caused by its floods. Tracts inundated by it lapse into sand and jungle, and in this way it has made a wilderness of about half the Madahpura Sub-division. In the early part of the 18th century, the Kus\u00ed river passed below Purniah town, but it has since worked westwards across about 50 miles of country, as indicated by now deserted channels, to its present line. Owing to these characteristics, its navigation is at all times of the year a matter of much difficulty. The channels of deep\nwater are constantly changing, new ones being yearly opened up, and old ones choked by vast sandbanks. The bed of the river is full of sunken trees or snags. Owing to the great velocity of the current, boats have frequently to wait several days for a favourable wind to help them up particular reaches of the river. They require to be preceded by a regular pilot, who goes some distance in advance, and selects the channel to be followed. The river is navigable all the year round, as far as the Nep\u00e1l frontier, by boats of 9 or 10 tons burden.\n\nAccording to a Hindu legend, this river is Kausiki, the daughter of Kusik, R\u00e1j\u00e1, King of Gadh\u00ed. Although the daughter of a Kshatriya, she was the wife of a Br\u00e1hman; and on giving birth to a son, who preferred the warlike exploits of his mother's race to the sacred duties of his father, she became changed into a river.\n\n**Kusi\u00e1r\u00e1.**\u2014The most southerly of the two branches of the Surm\u00e1 or B\u00e1rak river in Sylhet District, Assam. The point of bifurcation is at the village of Bhanga on the Cachar boundary. The Kusi\u00e1r\u00e1, after receiving the waters of the Langai, Juri, and Manu rivers, takes the name of Bibi\u00e1na, at Bah\u00e1durpur, where the old course of the B\u00e1rak river (now almost closed) bifurcates. Farther west, the waters of the Kusi\u00e1r\u00e1 or Bibi\u00e1na meet those of the Surm\u00e1 or northerly branch of the B\u00e1rak. The united stream takes various names at different parts of its course, and at length contributes to make up the estuary of the Meghn\u00e1. The various portions of this river are navigable throughout the year by boats of 4 tons burden, and, except in the very driest season, by boats of 20 tons burden.\n\n**Kussowlee.**\u2014Town and cantonment in Simla District, Punjab.\u2014See Kasauli.\n\n**Kutabdi\u00e1.**\u2014Island and lighthouse off the coast of Chittagong, Bengal. This and the neighbouring island of Maheshk\u00e1l (M\u00e1skh\u00e1l) bear a resemblance both in character and general appearance to the Gangetic Sundarbans, except that Kutabdi\u00e1 does not contain much of the genuine Sundarban jungle, and Maheshk\u00e1l has some rising grounds with large trees. The island was at one time nearly abandoned by its inhabitants, owing to its liability to incursions of the sea. Recently, large sums have been spent by Government as landlord to embank the island, and embankments upwards of 40 miles in extent have been constructed. A new land settlement was in progress in 1883, from which a large increase of revenue is expected. The island has already recovered its prosperity, and is well cultivated. Lighthouse situated on the west of the island; lat. 21\u00b0 52' 30\" N., long. 91\u00b0 53' E. A police outpost station, under the Maheshk\u00e1l th\u00e1n\u00e1, is located here.\n\n**Kutabnagar.**\u2014Town in S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh; situated on the high road, 18 miles west of S\u00edt\u00e1pur town. Population (1869) 2256; (1881) 2319. Bi-weekly market; vernacular school.\nKutabpur.\u2014Village in Midnapur District, Bengal. The site of a considerable fair held in April or May in honour of the goddess Br\u00e1hman\u00ed, which lasts for eight days.\n\nKutch.\u2014State in Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Cutch.\n\nKuth\u00e1r.\u2014One of the Simla Hill States, under the political superintendence of the Government of the Punjab. Lat. $30^\\circ 55' 30''$ to $31^\\circ 1' 30''$ N., and long. $76^\\circ 57'$ to $77^\\circ 1'$ E. This little State has an area of only 7 square miles, and contains 150 villages or hamlets, with 863 houses. Population (1881) 3648, namely, Hindus, 3494; Muhammadans, 149; and Sikhs, 5. The State lies west of Subathu, and formerly included it, until the land for the cantonment was purchased by the Government. The founder of the State is said to have come from Rajaoli in the Jamu territory, forty-seven generations ago, whence he fled in fear of the Muhammadan invaders. In 1815, when the G\u00farkhas were driven out of this country, the chief was replaced by the British, on the usual conditions of feudal service. The present R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Kuth\u00e1r is Jai Chand, a Chandrabansi Rajput, born in 1844. The family suffix is Chand. The annual revenue is estimated at about \u00a3500; tribute of \u00a3100 is paid to the British Government.\n\nKutiy\u00e1na (or Kati\u00e1na).\u2014Town in the State of Jun\u00e1garh, K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, Bombay Presidency. Situated on the Bh\u00e1dra river, 25 miles east of Porbandar. Lat. $21^\\circ 38'$ N., long. $70^\\circ 10'$ E. Population (1881) 8177. Muhammadans numbered 5895; Hindus, 2279; and Jains, 2. A fortified town, with an inner citadel. Old Kutiy\u00e1na is about a mile to the west of the modern town.\n\nKutosan.\u2014State, Mahi K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Katosan.\n\nKutru.\u2014Zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ri estate in Bastar State, Central Provinces. Bounded on the north and west by the river Indr\u00e1v\u00e1t\u00ed; comprising 150 poor villages, scattered over a wild country. The proprietor is a Gond.\n\nK\u00fatt\u00e1lam.\u2014Town in Tinneveli District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Courtallum.\n\nKuttiy\u00e1di.\u2014Pass in the Western Gh\u00e1ts, Malabar District, Madras Presidency. Lat. $11^\\circ 41'$ to $11^\\circ 43' 45''$ N., and long. $75^\\circ 49' 30''$ to $75^\\circ 52' 15''$ E. Leading from Kurumbranad taluk into the Wyn\u00e1d; steep, and only practicable for foot-passengers and beasts of burden.\n\nKuvam (Cooum).\u2014River of Chengalpat District, Madras Presidency. Lat. $13^\\circ 1' 30''$ to $13^\\circ 4' 10''$ N., and long. $79^\\circ 48'$ to $80^\\circ 20'$ E. Notable only as being the stream on which the City of Madras stands. It flows from a tank in the Kanchipur taluk, and in the upper portion of its course it is utilized for irrigation; but within Madras municipal limits it is little more than a large open sewer.\nKwa.\u2014Small river of British Burma, forming a portion of the boundary between the Arakan and Irawadi Divisions. It takes its rise in the western slopes of the Arakan Yoma range. After a south-south-west course of about 20 miles it turns to the west for about 10 miles, and then north-north-west for 10 more, when it opens out into the Bay of Bengal, a short distance below the village of Kwa. Its mouth forms a good harbour; but the entrance is rendered difficult by a bar of sand, on which during the ebb there are not more than $2\\frac{1}{4}$ fathoms of water. It is affected by the tide as far as Than-ga-ta-ywa during neap, and Pein-ne-gon-ywa during spring tides, and small boats can ascend as high as the former with the flood. Larger boats cannot go farther up than On-min-ywa, which can be reached in one tide.\n\nKwa.\u2014Township in Sandoway District, British Burma. There are 14 villages in the township. Area under cultivation (1881-82), 1024 acres, of which 902 acres were occupied by rice; other crops, sugar-cane, tobacco, cotton, and sesamum. Agricultural stock\u2014horned cattle, 809; boats, 44; ploughs, 41. Gross revenue, \u00a3263.\n\nKwa.\u2014Head-quarters of the southern township of Sandoway District, British Burma; on the right bank of the Kwa river, about a mile above its mouth. Lat. 17\u00b0 34' N., long. 94\u00b0 39' E. It has been much improved of late years, and is well laid out with broad straight roads, crossing at right angles, one of which has been extended to the neighbouring village of Ta-man-gon. The one or two tidal creeks which run up into the village are crossed by wooden foot-bridges, built principally by the people themselves, who also made the roads. The village is buried in a grove of fruit-trees\u2014mango, tamarind, jack, cocoa-nut, etc. The houses are generally large and good, with timber posts, mat walls, and thatched roofs. A little trade during the favourable seasons of the year is carried on by sea with parts of Bassein District farther south, and Chinese junks occasionally anchor off the village. Court-house and police station. The population, including that of the adjoining villages of Ta-man-gon, Alay-ywa, and Khyin-ts\u00fa, was 2044 in 1881 (of whom nearly all were Burmese, with a few Chinese and natives of India, and only 9 Arakanese).\n\nKwon-chan-gon.\u2014Village in the Pyawbwe township, Hanthawadi District, Pegu Division, British Burma. Pots, used in the manufacture of salt, are made here in considerable quantities. Population (1881), with the adjacent hamlet of Taw-pa-lwe, 1257.\n\nKyaik-kauk.\u2014A pagoda standing on the Than-lyin K\u00fan-dan, or stretch of low laterite hills, which extend from Than-lyin, or Syriam, to Kyok-tan in British Burma. This pagoda, 131 feet in height and 1200 feet in circumference at the base, is constructed almost entirely of large blocks of laterite. It was built to enshrine two hairs, locally supposed to have been given by Gautama himself to a hermit on the\nMartaban Hills, who afterwards presented them in 580 B.C. to Ze-yathe-na, King of Than-lyin. In 223 B.C., eight Rahanda or Buddhist monks visited Than-lyin, bringing as offerings to Baw-ga-the-na, the last independent sovereign, a bone of Buddha's forehead and a tooth, one of which relics was enshrined in Than-lyin by the pious monarch.\n\n**Kyaik-than-lan.**\u2014The chief pagoda in Maulmain, Amherst District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. Founded in 875 A.D. by a hermit named Tha-gnya or Th\u00ed-la, and supposed to contain one of Gautama's hairs. Height, 152 feet; circumference at base, 377 feet.\n\n**Kyaik-ti-jo.**\u2014A peak, 3650 feet high, on the crest of the main dividing range between the rivers Sittaung and Salwin, in British Burma. Its most remarkable features are the numerous granitoid boulders scattered about the summit, some being balanced in a marvellous manner on the most prominent rocks. On the more striking of these, pagodas have been built, among which the Kyaik-ti-jo-ga-le and the Kyaik-ti-jo are the principal. The latter, about 15 feet high, is built on a huge egg-shaped boulder perched on the apex of a shelving and tabular rock which it actually overhangs by nearly one-half. Pious Buddhists believe that the pagoda is retained in its position solely by the power of the hair of Gautama enshrined in it. This relic is fabled to have been given to a hermit living on the mountain by Gautama himself.\n\n**Kyaik-to.**\u2014Town in the Kyaik-to-bi-lin township, Shwe-gyin District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. Lat. 18\u00b0 N., long. 96\u00b0 50' E. Head-quarters of Sittaung Sub-division; centre of a busy trade in cattle, unhusked rice, areca-nuts, fish, salt, piece-goods, cotton twist, and hardware. Court and circuit houses, police station, and good market. Population (1881) 1917. Local revenue (1881), in addition to imperial taxes, \u00a3287.\n\n**Kyan-kin.**\u2014Township in the extreme north of Henzada District, Irawadi Division, British Burma. Lat. 18\u00b0 11' to 18\u00b0 30' N., and long. 94\u00b0 56' to 95\u00b0 20' E. Extends westwards from the Irawadi to the crest of the Arakan Yoma range, which separates it from Sandoway, a District of Arakan. The greater portion of the country is hilly, and covered with dense forest. The township is divided into 7 revenue circles, containing in 1881 a total population of 34,618 persons; gross revenue, \u00a37533; area under cultivation, 22,882 acres.\n\n**Kyan-kin.**\u2014Town in Henzada District, Irawadi Division, British Burma; situated in lat. 18\u00b0 19' N., and long. 95\u00b0 17' E., on the right bank of the Irawadi (Irrawaddy). Head-quarters of an Assistant Commissioner; contains a fine market, police station, and Public Works Department inspection bungalow. Considerable trade in rice. Population (1881) 7565. Local revenue (1881-82), \u00a372.\n\n**Kyat.**\u2014River in British Burma.\u2014See Taung-gnyo.\nKyauk-chaing-gale.\u2014Village in the Lem-yet-ya township, Bassein District, Irawadi Division, British Burma; situated on a river of the same name, a tributary of the Bassein. Population (1881) 875.\n\nKyauk-gyi.\u2014Township in the north of Shwe-gyin District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. Traversed from north to south by the Sittaung river; high mountainous country in the east; to the west extensive rice plains stretch between the hills and the river. Chief streams\u2014the Kwun, the Youk-thwa-wa, and the Kyauk-gyi, all feeders of the Sittaung. This township is divided into 8 revenue circles. Total population (1881) 36,447. In 1881\u201382, the land revenue was \u00a33256; fishery revenue, \u00a3698; capitation-tax, \u00a32672; net-tax, \u00a311; and local cess, \u00a3406; total gross revenue, \u00a37043. The township contains 177 villages. Area under cultivation, 25,016 acres, of which 23,462 are under rice, 126 under sesamum, 23 under tobacco, and 17 under sugar-cane. Agricultural stock (1881\u201382)\u2014horned cattle, 11,866; carts, 1531; and boats, 70.\n\nKyauk-gyi.\u2014Village in the circle of the same name, Shwe-gyin District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. Lat. 18\u00b0 20' N., long. 96\u00b0 40' E. A busy town, but the dense forest and lofty rocks surrounding it give it a dreary and desolate appearance. Under native rule, Kyaug-gyi was a fortified place, and traces of the old stockade still remain; in 1809, it was attacked and destroyed by the Zeng-mai Shans. Population (1881) 1002.\n\nKyauk-pyu.\u2014District in the Arakan Division, British Burma, lying between 18\u00b0 55' and 19\u00b0 22' N. lat., and between 93\u00b0 25' and 94\u00b0 E. long. Bounded on the north by Akyab District, and on the farther side of the Arakan Yoma Hills by Independent Burma; south by Sandoway; and on the west and south-west by the Bay of Bengal. Area, 4309 square miles. Population (1881) 149,303 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at Kyauk-pyu Town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Kyauk-pyu District consists of (1) a strip of the mainland extending from the An Pass, across the main range, to the Ma-\u00ed river, and (2) the large islands of Ramri and Man-aung, with many others to the south, lying off the coast of Sandoway. The mainland in the north and east is highly mountainous and forest-clad, and the lower portion is cut up into numerous islands by a network of tidal creeks. Between the mainland and Ramri lies a group of islands separated by deep, narrow, salt-water inlets, forming the north-eastern shore of Kyauk-pyu harbour, which extends for nearly 30 miles along Ramri in a south-easterly direction, and has an average breadth of 3 miles. In this harbour are several rocks\u2014known as the \u2018Pagoda Rock,\u2019 the \u2018Terribles,\u2019 the \u2018Brothers,\u2019 the \u2018Sisters,\u2019 etc.\u2014rising abruptly from the sea, and possessing no cultivable area.\n\nThe principal mountains in Kyauk-pyu District are the Arakan\nYomas, which send out spurs and sub-spurs almost to the sea-coast. This range is crossed within the limits of the District by two passes, the Da-let and the An. (See An Town.) The former, during the first Burmese war, was proved to be impassable by troops; and, owing to the precipitous nature of its ascents and descents, it is but little used by the inhabitants of the country. The An Pass, an important trade route, rises to a height of 4664 feet above sea-level; on the east side it falls 3777 feet in 8 miles. A chain of low hills traverses Ramri Island from north-west to south-east, the highest point being 3000 feet.\n\nThere are no rivers of any importance in Kyauk-py\u00fa District, but numerous small streams drain the larger islands; and the Da-let and the An, the chief streams on the mainland, are both navigable by large boats, the former for 25 and the latter for 45 miles of its course. Above these distances they become mere mountain torrents. The most important timber trees found in the District are\u2014pyin-gado (Xylia dolabriformis, Benth.); ka-gnyin (Dipterocarpus alatus, Roxb.), furnishing wood-oil; three species of kok-ko (Albizzia procera, Benth., A. Lebbek, Benth., and A. stipulata, Boivin.), used for boats; kyan (Terminalia myriocarpa, Heurc. and M\u00fcll.-Arg.), and ban-bwe (Careya arborea, Roxb.), used for house-posts. The estimated area of uncultivable forest land is about 3740 square miles.\n\nKyauk-py\u00fa contains numerous mud \u2018volcanoes,\u2019 from which marsh gas is frequently discharged. Occasional issues of flames rise to a great height, and illuminate the country around for miles. The largest \u2018volcano\u2019 is situated in the centre of Cheduba Island. Earth-oil (petroleum) wells exist in several places in the District, and for some years were farmed out by the State. The industry has of late received a fresh impulse from European capital and steam power. In 1880, the Boringa Company was formed, with steam machinery for sinking wells and pumping oil, a large refinery, and a staff of English and Canadian artificers. In 1883\u201384 the Company had 24 wells, the deepest of which is over 1200 feet. During 1883\u201384 the Company pumped from 10 wells a total of 234,300 gallons of crude oil. Of this, 65,450 gallons were refined, and the rest sold in the crude state. The gross yield of the Company\u2019s sales was about \u00a36000. Another association, the Arakan Company, started during 1883\u201384 with steam machinery, and sank seven wells, the deepest of which was 400 feet. Five of these wells yielded in 1883\u201384 an output of 107,800 gallons, all of which was sold on the spot in the crude state. A smaller Company, called the Patrolia Company, obtained in 1883\u201384 a prospecting licence, and sank 10 wells, some to the depth of 400 and 500 feet. Unfortunately all these wells have yielded no oil. The natives, who own rights in several wells, do not use steam boring apparatus; but with windlasses, sheers, and local boring tools they\nhave sunk holes 250 and 350 feet deep. One Arakanese worker had a total output of 24,090 gallons, at an outlay of \u00a376 for the year. Another Arakanese obtained 20,075 gallons, at an outlay of \u00a334 for the year. The total output of the field, including the Boronga Company's wells, was 404,325 gallons in 1883-84. The other mineral products of Kyauk-pyu District include limestone, iron, and coal.\n\nPopulation, etc.\u2014By the Census of 1872, the population of Kyauk-pyu District was found to number 144,177 persons; in 1873-74 it had risen to 145,665; and in 1876-77, to 149,935. The Census of 1881 returns a population of 149,303; so that during the ten years ending 1881 there has been an increase of 5126. This increase is only part of a general increase which has taken place over the whole of Burma since British occupation. The number of males in 1881 was 74,476; females, 74,827: the whole inhabiting 937 towns and villages, and occupying 28,691 houses. Density of population, 34\u00b76 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, '2; houses per square mile, 7; persons per occupied house, 5\u00b72.\n\nIn 1881 the population was thus divided\u2014Arakanese, 118,944; Burmese, 14,907; Khyins, 11,617; Muhammadans, Hindus, etc., 3835. The Arakanese inhabit mainly Cheduba, Ramri, and the coast of the mainland; the Burmese, the valley of the An; and the Khyins, the hill country. The Khins or Chins trace their origin to the neighbourhood of the Chindwin river. Only in Thayet-myo District are there more Chins than in Kyauk-pyu. Their habits and superstitions have been described already. (See Burma.) The most remarkable of their customs is the habit of tattooing the faces of their young girls so completely as not to leave the eyelid free from the blue-black tracing. The Muhammadans are of mixed blood, descendants of the captives made by the Arakanese kings in their incursions into Bengal, and of the remnant of the followers of Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1, the brother of Aurangzeb.\n\nClassified according to age, there were, under 15 years\u2014males, 28,792; and females, 27,351; total, 56,143. The analysis of the population shows that at every period up to 50, except between 12 and 20, the males exceed the females in number; but above 50, the proportion is reversed. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Buddhists, 133,732; Nat-worshippers, 11,042; Muhammadans, 4246; Hindus, 229; Christians, 54. As regards occupation, the Census distributes the male population into the following six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including all State officials and members of the learned professions, 1433; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 214; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 2532; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including shepherds, 28,170; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 4827; and (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers,\nmale children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 37,300. The District does not contain a single town with 5000 inhabitants. Of its 937 villages, 711 have less than two hundred inhabitants; 199 from two to five hundred; 21 from five hundred to one thousand; 4 from one to two thousand; and 2 from two to five thousand. Kyauk-pyu, the head-quarters, situated on Ramri Island, has a population of 3747; Ramri, 3461; Man-aung, 512; An, 1492; Mye-bon, 546.\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014Out of 4309 square miles, the total area of the District, no less that 3740, including the surface covered by streams and creeks, are returned as absolutely uncultivable; and in 1882-83, only 163 were actually under tillage. There are 390 square miles of cultivable waste. The area under the principal crops in 1882-83 was\u2014rice (including fallow land), 90,105 acres; sugar-cane, 1362; tobacco, 1828; dani, 2684; indigo, 65; fibres, 50; plantains, 960 acres. The rice land is not very productive, the average yield per acre being only 880 lbs.; the quantity exported varies considerably\u2014in 1873-74, 1234 tons were shipped, and in 1881-82 only 1 cwt. The tobacco is grown chiefly for home consumption, and that produced in Cheduba is considered the finest. This is the only District of British Burma, except Akyab, in which indigo is grown. There are two pluckings for each sowing; and an acre of land sown with about 32 lbs. of seed will produce about 15 cwt. of dye. The selling price per lb. in the local markets is 2d., and the annual profit per acre is estimated at from \u00a311 to \u00a312. Cotton and sesamum are cultivated in the taungya or hill gardens. About 59 square miles of the total area are said to be suitable for tea plantation.\n\nThe produce per acre in 1882-83 was\u2014rice, 902 lbs.; sugar, 1312 lbs.; tobacco, 820 lbs.; indigo, 246 lbs.; and fibres, 325 lbs. The price of the most important products (per maund of 80 lbs.) was in the same year\u2014rice, 6s.; sugar, 12s.; indigo, 11s. Whilst the area under cultivation is extending and prices generally rising slowly, the rates of wages are rising somewhat more rapidly\u2014skilled labourers now receive 3s. to 4s.; unskilled labourers, 9d. to 2s. per diem. The agricultural stock in 1882-83 comprised 24,635 buffaloes, 58,084 cows, bulls, and bullocks, 3987 pigs, 635 carts, 17,843 ploughs, and 4431 boats. The land is held chiefly by small proprietors, who work their holdings (which seldom exceed 5 acres) themselves. When land is let, the rent, as a rule, is paid in kind; and this in the case of rice land is very low, being about 10 bushels a season. The size of the holdings shows no tendency to increase, and it is exceedingly rare to find a landowner settled in a town and living on his rents.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The principal articles manufactured in the District, besides the silk and cotton cloths woven in almost every house, are salt, indigo, pottery, coarse sugar, and sesamum oil. The\nDistrict is one of the three chief salt manufacturing Districts of Burma, the other two being Amherst and Bassein. In the dry season, salt is made by boiling down sea-water on the banks of the numerous tidal creeks. The produce varies with the local demand for fishcuring, and with the quantity imported from foreign countries into Akyab and Bassein. In 1871-72, 11,681 cwt. of salt were manufactured; in 1872-73, 8057; and in 1873-74, 13,911 cwt. Earthen pots are made principally in the Ramr\u00ed, Myoma, Kaing-chaung, and Than-taung circles, and are sold on the spot to the salt-boilers. Both men and women are employed in this industry; and it has been calculated that it takes a man and a woman one month to make and burn from 800 to 1000 pots. Salt pots are sold at about 12s. the hundred, and others at half that rate. Sesamum oil is made during the hot season, and is expressed by a simple process, in which a large pestle is turned round and round in a mortar by a bullock. In some cases the oil runs off by a hole in the side of the mortar; but more often it is collected by the primitive method of dipping cloths into the mass, and wringing them out when saturated. One mill will turn out about 110 lbs. of oil a day. The oil not required for home consumption is exported principally to Akyab. Sugar-cane is grown extensively on Ramr\u00ed Island, and a coarse kind of sugar is made by crushing the cane in a press worked by a bullock or buffalo, and by boiling the juice down. Indigo is also manufactured in Ramr\u00ed.\n\nThe total length of water communications in Kyauk-py\u00fa District is 894 miles; of third-class made roads, 152 miles. The steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company call once a month on their way from Calcutta to Rangoon (via Akyab) and the Straits Settlements, and vice versa; and, from November to May, once a month on their way from Calcutta to Sandoway and back. During the rainy season, the mails are sent to and from Akyab in boats, which run through the creeks, thus avoiding the open sea.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The imperial and provincial revenue (derived chiefly from land and capitation taxes) amounted in 1856-57 to \u00a321,062, in 1866-67 to \u00a328,640, in 1876-77 to \u00a343,454, and in 1882-83 to \u00a332,278. In 1881-82, a local revenue of \u00a37190 was derived from port and municipal funds, a ten per cent. cess on the land and fishery dues, and other sources. In 1882-83 the land revenue was \u00a314,894.\n\nIn Burmese times, the mainland portion of this District formed part of Arakan Proper, whilst Ramr\u00ed and Cheduba were separate and independent Governorships. After the country was ceded to the British, the two last were formed into Ramr\u00ed District, and placed under an officer styled Principal Assistant Commissioner; while the greater portion of the mainland constituted another District, similarly\nruled, called An. After this arrangement had lasted nearly thirty years, An was joined to Ramr\u00ed, and placed under a Deputy Commissioner, with his head-quarters at Kyauk-py\u00fa; and in 1871-72 the area was increased by the addition in the north of four circles from Akyab. During the first few years of British occupation, the main body of the garrison was stationed at Sandoway, but subsequently it was removed to Kyauk-py\u00fa, and finally withdrawn in 1855.\n\nThe District is divided into the 5 townships of Cheduba or Man-aung, Ramr\u00ed, Kyauk-py\u00fa, An, and Mye-bon. The police force, under a superintendent, consisted in 1882-83 of 359 officers and men, of whom 25 are river police. These figures give a proportion of 1 policeman to every 12 square miles, and to every 416 persons. Total cost in 1882-83, \u00a37561. The majority are located in the An township, which is traversed by the main road across the Yoma mountains into Upper Burma; in the north, Khyins are enlisted to keep the hillmen in order. In 1882, the average daily number of prisoners confined in the jail at Kyauk-py\u00fa was 87; average annual cost per prisoner, \u00a39, 8s. The hospital and charitable dispensary are also at Kyauk-py\u00fa; the number of patients treated at the former, in 1882-83, was\u2014indoor, 240; out-door, 1799. Most of the patients suffered from malaria, ague, and intermittent fevers. During the same year 4948 persons were vaccinated. As early as 1837, the State established a school, now classed as \u2018middle,\u2019 in the head-quarters town. In 1881-82 this school had 67 pupils on the rolls, and a daily average attendance of 61 pupils, all taught the English language. In 1881 there were 43 indigenous schools in the District. The Census Report of 1881 returned 11,308 boys and 2961 girls as under instruction; besides 23,607 males and 513 females able to read and write but not under instruction. [For further particulars regarding Kyauk-py\u00fa District, see the British Burma Gazetteer, compiled by authority (Government Press, Rangoon, 1879), vol. ii. pp. 298-314. Also the British Burma Census Report for 1881, and the several Provincial Administration and Departmental Reports from 1880 to 1884.]\n\nKyauk-py\u00fa.\u2014Township in Kyauk-py\u00fa District, Arakan Division, British Burma. Area, 383 square miles; occupying the north end of Ramr\u00ed Island, and a group of islands to the north-east formed by the numerous tidal creeks intersecting the coast. Head-quarters at Kyauk-py\u00fa Town. The township comprises 22 revenue circles. Population (1881) 38,667, mainly Arakanese. Gross revenue, \u00a310,075. Chief products\u2014rice, indigo, salt, and sugar. For the manufacture of the last-named article, 681 mills were at work in 1881-82.\n\nKyauk-py\u00fa.\u2014Town, port, and head-quarters of Kyauk-py\u00fa District, Arakan Division, British Burma; situated in the north of Ramr\u00ed Island, in lat. 19\u00b0 22' N., and long. 93\u00b0 30' E. Its name, \u2018White Stone,\u2019 is said\nto be derived either from the white pebbly beach, or from a rock with a white pagoda at the entrance of the harbour. The former derivation is supported by the best authorities. When Arakan was ceded to the British in 1825, after the first Burmese war, a small fishing village occupied the site of the modern town of Kyauk-py\u00fa, and Ramr\u00ed was then the chief civil station. Captain Pemberton, in his report on the Eastern Frontier of India (1835), states that the cantonments were built close to the sea-shore upon a sandy plain, bounded on the southwest by a low range of sandstone hills, 500 to 2000 feet in height, which breaks the severity of the monsoon. The whole tract behind the cantonments, as far as the mouth of the Oung-chaung creek on the east, was lined with mangrove jungles. Along the shores of this tidal inlet the salt of the Province was chiefly made; but the manufacture has never been extensively encouraged, as it is carried on far more cheaply on the western side of the Bay of Bengal. This description of Kyauk-py\u00fa is still fairly accurate, but the barracks no longer exist, the troops having been finally withdrawn in 1855. The town contains court and circuit houses, jail, hospital, charitable dispensary, school, and market. The harbour extends for many miles along the east shore of Ramr\u00ed Island, but numerous sunken rocks render the approach dangerous. The channel, however, is well buoyed. The population in 1867 numbered 3689 persons; in 1881, 3747. The local revenue amounted in 1881\u201382 to \u00a31045. In 1882\u201383 the imports were valued at \u00a3150, and the exports at \u00a34962.\n\n**Kyauung-s\u00fan** (or Chaung-sun).\u2014Village in Bil\u00fa-gywon island, Amherst District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma; situated on the edge of the low hills forming the backbone of the island. The western portion is called Win-tsin, and the eastern Ka-raik-thit. In the former portion, an artificial reservoir with a water area varying from half to one square mile, has been made by throwing an embankment across a valley. The Government has made a bridged opening at the western end as an escape, to prevent the water overflowing the road crossing the embankment. Population (1881) 2021. Court-house and police station.\n\n**Kyelang** (Kailang).\u2014Village in the L\u00e1hul Sub-division of K\u00e1ngra District, Punjab; situated on the right bank of the river Bh\u00e1ga, about four miles above its junction with the Chandra, and on the main trade route between the Rohtang and B\u00e1ra L\u00e1cha passes. A post-office is maintained here during the summer months, and the village has been a station of the Moravian Mission for many years. The mission-house is a substantial residence, the lower part of which is used as a chapel. A school supported by a Government grant was formerly managed by the missionaries, who, although they have not met with much success in the matter of conversions to Christianity, are looked up\nto as friends and protectors by every inhabitant of the valley. The school is now under Government management.\n\n**Kyl\u00e1sa** (Kailasa).\u2014Hill in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 17\u00b0 47' N., long. 83\u00b0 22' E.; highest point, 1758 feet above sea-level. This hill was suggested at one time as a sanitarium for Bengal; and with that view a kind of hotel and one or two houses were built, the R\u00e1ja of Vizian\u00e1garam assisting the project with much liberality. There is an average difference of about 12 degrees between the temperature of Kyl\u00e1sa and that of Vizagapatam, 8 miles distant; and owing to its proximity to the sea (within 3 miles), and the absence of forest growth, the site is singularly free from fever. It is easy of access, and the climate is said to be bracing and invigorating. But whether from the difficulty of a water-supply, or want of capital, the project of converting Kyl\u00e1sa into a sanitarium has been abandoned.\n\n**Kynchiong**.\u2014River in the Kh\u00e1si Hills, Assam.\u2014See Kanchiang.\n\n**Kyouk-hpyu**.\u2014District and town, Arakan Division, British Burma. See Kyauk-pyu. A large number of towns and other places in British Burma, commencing with the syllable Kyouk in the first edition of *The Imperial Gazetteer*, appear in this edition under Kyauk, according to a revised system of transliteration prescribed for British Burma.\n\n**Ky\u00fan-pyaw**.\u2014Head-quarters of the Ky\u00fan-pyaw township in Bassein District, Irawadi Division, British Burma. Lat. 17\u00b0 17' N., long. 95\u00b0 15' E. Large export of rice to Bassein. Contains a court-house, police station, and market. Population (1881) 2835.\n\n**Ky\u00fan-ton**.\u2014One of the main branches of the Irawadi (Irrawaddy) river in British Burma, from which it bifurcates at a place about 10 miles below Gnyaung-don, following a south-westerly course to the sea. During the rains a rapid current sets downwards; but at other times this channel is tidal throughout its whole length, the rise and fall at its mouth being, at springs, about 7 feet. The Ky\u00fan-ton is navigable by river steamers from its northern entrance for about 60 miles. The islands in this river are numerous, the two principal ones being Meim-ma-hla (16 miles long by 3 broad) and Kyw\u00fan-gnyo-gy\u00ed. In its upper reaches the Ky\u00fan-ton is known as the In-te, and lower down as the Maran or Kyaik-p\u00ed; by Europeans generally it is called the Dala. River traffic in rice, sugar, areca-nut, nga-p\u00ed, dani-leaves, and poles, etc.\n\n**L**\n\n**Labdarya.**\u2014T\u00e1luk in Larkana Sub-division, Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Situated between 27\u00b0 15' and 27\u00b0 31' N. lat., and between 68\u00b0 2' and 68\u00b0 23' E. long. Area, 207 square miles.\nPopulation (1881) 33,088, namely, 17,726 males and 15,362 females, dwelling in 4495 houses. Hindus numbered (1881) 1472; Muhammadans, 28,593; and Sikhs, 3023. Number of tap\u00e1s, 4; number of villages, 43. Revenue in 1881-82, \u00a313,992, of which \u00a313,219 was derived from imperial sources, and \u00a3773 from local funds. In 1873-74 the revenue was \u00a39214, of which \u00a38450 was derived from imperial sources, and \u00a3764 from local funds. The taluk contained in 1884, 2 criminal courts and 4 police stations or th\u00e1n\u00e1s; regular police, 27 men. The area assessed to land revenue in 1882-83 was 40,656 acres; area under actual cultivation, 39,371 acres.\n\nLa-bwut-ku-la.\u2014Village in Bassein District, Irawadi Division, British Burma. Population (1881) 1004; number of houses, 233. In 1877 the population was 1800.\n\nLaccadive Islands (Laksha Dwipa\u2014'The Hundred Thousand Islands'; also called the Divi or Amindivi Islands).\u2014A group of 14 islands off the west or Malabar coast of the Madras Presidency, lying between 10\u00b0 and 14\u00b0 N. lat., and between 71\u00b0 40' and 74\u00b0 E. long. Average distance from the mainland, 200 miles. There are 9 inhabited islands, 2 uninhabited, and 3 open reefs. Total population in 1871, 13,495; number of houses, 2442; total population in 1881, 14,473; number of houses, 2470. The northern portion of the group is attached to the Collectorate of South K\u00e1nara, the remainder belong to Al\u00ed R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Cannanore, and form part of the administrative District of Malabar.\n\nThe following are the names of the islands:\n\n| South K\u00e1nara or Amindivi Islands | Population (1881) | Houses |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|--------|\n| Amini or Amindivi                | 2060             | 322    |\n| Chetlat                          | 577              | 150    |\n| Kadam                            | 245              | 40     |\n| Kiltan                           | 790              | 198    |\n| Bitra\u2014uninhabited                | \u2014                | \u2014      |\n\n| Cannanore Islands                |                  |        |\n| Agatti                           | 1375             | 302    |\n| Kavaratti                        | 2129             | 314    |\n| Androth                          | 2884             | 407    |\n| Kalpeni (Kaluf\u00e9e of Ibn Batuta)  | 1222             | 213    |\n| Minikoi (Minkat)                 | 3191             | 524    |\n| Suheli\u2014uninhabited               | \u2014                | \u2014      |\n\nTotal, 14,473 2470\n\nThe island of Minikoi more properly belongs to the Maldive group, and its inhabitants speak a different language from that (Malay\u00e1lam) in use on the Laccadives proper.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Each of the islands is situated on an extensive\ncoral shoal, with an area of from 2 to 3 square miles. Their surface is flat, and no part of any of these formations rises more than 10 or 15 feet above the level of the sea. Around each island a more or less extensive fringe of coral reef extends, broader and more shelving on the west, where the island naturally most requires protection, and narrow and abrupt on the east. The outer edges are higher than the body of these shoals; and extending, as they do, in a semicircle at a distance of 500 yards to \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of a mile round the west, generally enclose a regularly formed lagoon, in which the water is so still that in the worst weather coir, or cocoa-nut fibre, may be soaked without danger of being washed away. The body of the island is the more perfect development of the eastern and protected side of the coral formation. The same feature characterizes all these shoals, and leads to the theory that they rose to the surface in the form of circular or oval shallow basins, and that under the protection of the shoal the east rim gradually developed itself towards the centre and formed an island. This theory is strengthened by the fact, that on some of the islands this gradual increase towards the lagoon is still going on. The receding tide leaves the outer edge of the reef nearly dry, and the tide water passes out of the lagoon by two or three breaches in the outer rim, which are sufficiently large to admit the light native craft into the natural harbour, several feet deep even at low tide, formed by the lagoon.\n\nUnder the surface of all these islands lies a stratum of coral or limestone which, varying from 1 foot to \\( 1\\frac{1}{2} \\) foot in thickness, is seemingly above the highest level of the water. This coral stratum stretches throughout the shoal. Beneath it is loose wet sand; and by breaking the crust and removing a few spadesful of sand, to allow the water to accumulate, a pool of fresh water may be obtained in most parts. All wells, tanks, and pits for soaking cocoa-nut fibre or coir (where soaked in fresh water) are thus made. The sand gradually presses towards this excavation, and from its constant removal some of the wells and tanks extend under the vault of coral for some distance all round. The water in these wells is quite fresh, and always abundant; but it is affected by the tide, rises and falls several inches, and is said to be not very wholesome.\n\nAbove the limestone or coral crust the soil lies to a depth varying from 2 to 6 feet, generally composed of light coral sand, which is finer than common sea sand, but quite as dry. In some parts the soil is entirely made up of small loose pieces of coral without any other soil, a condition which is said to be particularly well adapted to the cocoa-nut. The surface soil, except in two of the islands (Androth and Kalpeni), is naturally so barren that there is little or no spontaneous vegetation in most of the islands; and although during the monsoon some small crops of coarse dry grains are produced, their scantiness\nshows that the prosperity of the islands must ever depend upon the cocoa-nut. 'Being so low,' writes Commander Taylor in his *Sailing Directions*, 'with cocoa-nut trees only 50 or 60 feet above the sea, these islands are not discernible at any distance, and therefore are commonly and prudently avoided by navigators; but amongst them there are safe and wide channels through which a ship may extricate herself if, by any error in reckoning or otherwise, she gets among them.'\n\nThere are but few animals of any kind. Rats are unfortunately numerous, and prove very destructive to the cocoa-nut plantations. Tortoises are common, and fish is abundant.\n\n**History, Administration, etc.** \u2014 For two and a half centuries, the Laccadive Islands formed part of the small principality of Cannanore, having been conferred as *j\u00e1gir* on that family by the Chirakk\u00e1l or Kolattiri R\u00e1j\u00e1 (about A.D. 1550). The island of Minikoi was a more recent acquisition from the Sult\u00e1n of the Maldives. In 1786 the northern islanders revolted, and transferred their allegiance to Mysore. In 1799, when K\u00e1nara fell to the East India Company, these islands were not restored to the Bib\u00ed of Cannanore, but a remission of revenue (\u00a3525) was conceded instead; hence the different status of the two portions of the group. From 1855 to 1860, the southern islands were sequestrated for arrears of revenue. This again happened in 1877, and they are at present directly administered by the Collector of Malabar, to the unqualified satisfaction of the inhabitants. Such revenue as is derived from the Laccadive Islands has for more than a century been obtained by a monopoly of the staple produce of the group\u2014*coir*. The entire out-turn of the fibre is claimed by the Government as respects the northern portion of the group, and by Al\u00ed R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Cannanore as respects the islands which still remain under native management. The article is paid for to the producers at fixed prices, and is sold on the coast at the market rates; the difference constitutes the revenue or profits of trade of the Government and Al\u00ed R\u00e1j\u00e1 respectively. The latter pays a fixed tribute or *peshkash* of Rs. 10,000 (\u00a31000) to the Government on account of the islands which he manages. No change has been made for many years in the price which is given by Government for the *coir* produced in the islands attached to K\u00e1nara. Payment is made partly in rice and partly in money; and as the price is fairly equitable as compared with the average rates which could be obtained on the coast by the producers, the arrangement is still popular with the northern islanders.\n\nOn the southern islands, on the contrary, the price has been constantly changed by the native chief, and so reduced as to produce discontent and evasion of the monopoly; other monopolies (cocoa-nut, cowries, tortoise-shell, and the like) and imposts have been exacted or maintained, and entire alienation between Al\u00ed R\u00e1j\u00e1 and the inhabitants\nhas existed for years. In Minikoi, which is geographically the most isolated of the group, a more profitable arrangement for the inhabitants exists, and few, if any, monopolies are enforced. Comparative contentment and loyalty consequently exist here. Numerous wrecks of large vessels have occurred on the reefs, and on more than one occasion the inhabitants have been hard pressed for food owing to stress of weather.\n\nThe K\u00e1nara Islands are managed by a Sub-Magistrate and munsif; and the Cannanore group by amins (revenue agents). The islands are from time to time visited by a European officer. The people are of a peaceable disposition, with no little aptitude for self-government, and their disputes are generally settled by their own head-men according to local custom.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The entire population numbers (1881) 14,473, of whom about one-third are in the Government islands (K\u00e1nara group). The people are all Musalm\u00e1ns, and, like the M\u00e1ppill\u00e1s of the neighbouring coast, of Hindu descent. 'A tradition is preserved among them, that their forefathers formed a part of an expedition from Malay\u00e1la which set out for Mecca in search of their apostate king Cheram\u00e1n Perum\u00e1l (see Malabar District), and was wrecked on these islands. The inhabitants certainly remained Hindus long after their first settlement, and were probably converted to Isl\u00e1m not more than 250 or 300 years ago. They retain some of the general distinctions of caste, as well as the law of succession in the female line, with certain local modifications. This law is still strictly adhered to on the island of Am\u00ednd\u00edvi, where distinctions of caste and a more numerous population have been obstacles to the gradual change, by which the custom of regular paternal descent is supplanting the local law of Malabar, on the islands of Kadam, Kiltan, and Chetlat of the K\u00e1nara portion of the group; in the southern islands, still under native management, the old custom is more rigidly observed.'\u2014(Robinson.)\n\nThe proportion of females in the population is unusually large. There are, for the whole group, 111.79 females to every 100 males; and in some islands this disproportion is still more marked; thus in Minikoi the excess rises as high as nearly 26 per cent. The boys of Minikoi follow their fathers to sea at an early age, and when the ships are absent the proportion of males left on the island is extremely small. The general disparity is due partly to the emigration of the male population to the mainland for employment, and partly to accidental causes.\n\nCustoms, Language, etc.\u2014Monogamy is universal, and the women appear in public freely, with their heads uncovered; in Minikoi, they take the lead in almost every business except navigation. The language of the Laccadive group is Malay\u00e1lam, which is, however, written in the Arabic character; that of Minikoi is Maldive, with a mixture of corrupt\nMalayalam. The head-men and pilots of most of the islands know a little Arabic; and the male inhabitants can generally both read and write. The number in 1881 who could read and write was returned by the Census at 2377, while the number under instruction was returned at 246. The inhabitants are bold seamen and expert boat-builders. They own 184 large and 719 small boats, navigating them by European instruments, with the use of which they are familiar. The chief cultivation is that of the cocoa-nut palm; and the almost sole industry is the preparation and exportation of cocoa-nut fibre (coir). The number of cultivators returned in 1881 was 1861, a majority of whom dwelt in the Aminidivi group. The soaking of coir and the other processes connected therewith are almost entirely conducted by the women, who in 1881 were employed thus to the number of 4638. The men convey the produce, coir, cocoa-nuts, jaggery, copra, vindia (a sweetmeat), besides tortoise-shell and cowries, to the mainland\u2014from the northern islands to Mangalore; from the southern islands to the Malabar ports and Ceylon, the Maldives, and Calcutta. The annual value of the total exports is about \u00a317,000.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate is healthy on the whole, but the last European officer who visited Minikoi (1881) suffered with his establishment from malarious fever. Cholera has once visited Kalpeni, and formerly small-pox was the most dreaded disease of the islands. The practice, however, of both vaccination and inoculation has greatly reduced the mortality from this cause. Leprosy prevails; but the islanders have traditional sanitary laws, such as separate burial-grounds for small-pox and cholera deaths, and are otherwise careful in their habits. Cyclones, travelling up the Malabar coast, for a time submerge some of these islands; notably the storm of April 1847, which destroyed above 1000 people. More than one-sixth of the adult male population of Minikoi perished in a cyclone in 1867.\n\nLachhmangarh.\u2014Town in the Shaikhawati District, Jaipur State, Rajputana. Population (1881) 8713. Hindus numbered 7262; Muhammadans, 1380; and \u2018others,\u2019 71. Belongs to the Sikar chiefship (a feudatory of Jaipur), and named after Rao Raja Lachhman Singh, a former Sikar chief, by whom the place was founded in 1806. The town is fortified, and is built after the model of the city of Jaipur. It contains many handsome edifices, occupied principally by the banking class. Post-office.\n\nLachmangarh.\u2014Town in the Native State of Alwar (Ulwar), Rajputana. Population (1872) 3779; number of houses, 996; not returned in the Census of 1881. Twenty-three miles south-east of Alwar city. The original name was Taur, but the fort was re-named by Partab Singh. Najaf Khan besieged the place.\n\nLadakh.\u2014In its restricted but more correct sense, the name of\nLad\u00e1kh is applicable only to one of the three outlying Governorships under the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kashm\u00edr (Cashmere),\u2014the other two being B\u00e1lt\u00edst\u00e1n and Gilgit. It is of extremely irregular outline; but, speaking broadly, it may be described as comprising the valley of the Indus, and also of most of its tributaries, from $32^\\circ$ to $35^\\circ$ N. lat., and from $75^\\circ 29'$ to $79^\\circ 29'$ E. long. The different Districts of Central Lad\u00e1kh, R\u00fapshu, and Neobra, besides the bleak and almost uninhabited plateaux of the Kuen-lun and Linzhithang plains, together make up the Province. The area of Lad\u00e1kh is estimated by General Cunningham at about 30,000 square miles; but this includes Zanskar, and some other Districts which do not belong to it in a political sense. Mr. F. Drew is the most recent authority on Lad\u00e1kh; his return of the population, as ascertained by the Census of 1873, is 20,621; the 168,000 given by Cunningham, the 165,000 of Moorcroft (1822), and the estimate of 200,000 furnished by Dr. Bellew in 1873, of course apply to the more extended area.\n\nLying as it does at the back of the great central range of the Him\u00e1layas, it may be readily understood that Lad\u00e1kh is one of the loftiest of the inhabited regions of the globe. The valleys and plateaux vary between 9000 and 17,000 feet, while many of the peaks attain altitudes of 25,000 feet. The chief rivers of Lad\u00e1kh are the Indus, and its tributaries the Sh\u00e1yak, Neobra, Chanchengmo, and Zanskar. There are several salt lakes, the more important of which are the Pang Kong and Cho-moriri.\n\nThe climate is characterized by remarkable extremes, burning heat during the day being succeeded by piercing cold at night, while vegetation is parched by the excessive dryness of the air. The general aspect of the country is that of a somewhat complicated series of gigantic mountains, many of which rise to the limit of perpetual snow, interspersed with occasional valleys and deep ravines, where a few acres of ground available for cultivation are usually to be found. These support a few cereals, fruit-trees, poplars, and willows. The slopes of the mountains and the lofty table-lands in the north-east of the Province are, with the exception of occasional forest growth, almost destitute of vegetation. The wild animals comprise the kiang or wild ass, sheep, goat, marmot, and hare; snow-pheasant, red-legged partridge, eagle, and water-fowl; while the principal domestic animals are ponies, asses, oxen, sheep, goats, and dogs. The sheep are most useful, as nearly the whole of the traffic of the country is transported on their backs. General Cunningham relates that in one day he saw as many as from five to six thousand sheep laden with shawl and common wool, borax, sulphur, and dried apricots, all making their way to the hill Provinces on the south-west. The common domestic goat of Lad\u00e1kh is the well-known shawl goat, the wool of which is exported to Kashm\u00edr, Nep\u00e1l, and British India. In 1853, General Cunningham estimated the amount of wool produced in Lad\u00e1kh at about 2400 maunds.\nThe trade of the country in home produce is confined to four articles, viz. wool, borax, sulphur, and dried fruits. The total value of this trade was estimated by Cunningham at \u00a38000. But the fact of Leh being an important entrep\u00f4t for trade between Kashmir and Hindustan on the south, and Yarkand, Khotan, and Tibet on the north and east, has probably contributed more to the wealth of the country. The chief imports from Chinese territories are wool (sheep and goats), tea, gold dust and coins, silver, silk, and charas (an intoxicating preparation of hemp); while those from India consist of cotton goods, hides, skins and leathers, grain, guns, pistols, etc., brocades, and tea. In 1877, the foreign imports and exports into Leh were valued at \u00a3112,817 and \u00a389,618 respectively, while the local imports and exports amounted together to \u00a33573. The trade in wool with the Punjab in 1882\u201383 was valued at \u00a383,509. The intermediate position of R\u00fapshu has induced many travelling merchants to come that way, the two chief routes from thence into British India being over the Bar\u00e1 Lacha and Parang Passes to L\u00e1hul and Simla respectively. The Lhasa tea merchants pass through R\u00fapshu on their way to Leh, with their ventures of brick-tea.\n\nThe Lad\u00e1khis are a short, strong, but ugly race of Turanian origin, and Buddhists in religion. They are a settled and cultivating people, living in villages, which vary from 9500 to 13,500 feet above the sea. They are cheerful, willing, and not quarrelsome, unless excited by their intoxicating drink, chang; simplicity and clumsiness are in a measure their chief characteristics. On the other hand, authorities agree in remarking that the Lad\u00e1khis far excel the Indian munshis, or learned men, in one point, i.e. the understanding of a map. The man\u2019s dress is a wide and long woollen coat (choga), confined at the waist by a woollen kamarband or scarf, thick boots, and felt gaiters. The women wear a gown, the skirt gathered into plaits, a sort of sheepskin shawl over the shoulders, and for head-dress a strip of cloth ornamented with shells or rough turquoises. The shoes are the same for both sexes, and the dress of neither varies with the season of the year. Almost all the Lad\u00e1khis are engaged in agriculture, and the area cultivated by one family is from 2 to 4 acres. The grain which is most prolific, and which is sown to the greatest extent, is a loose-grained and hardy barley; besides this, wheat, peas, and common barley grow at lesser altitudes. The food is generally barley-meal made into a porridge, or else into a sort of dough with butter-milk; chang (a light beer) and tea among the better-to-do classes are the usual drinks. They are very dirty in person, but extremely hardy, and carry great weights with facility and endurance. The women have much social liberty, and do a large share of the manual labour. Except among the few richer people, polyandry, or plurality of husbands, is quite general; the\npractice having no doubt arisen from the limited extent of cultivable land, and the general inelasticity of the country's resources.\n\nIn nearly every village there is a monastery, which sometimes holds but one or two L\u00e1mas or monks, sometimes hundreds. These monasteries are, as a rule, conspicuously built on a spur of the mountain or isolated rock, and always somewhat apart from the village itself. The supply of priests is kept up by one boy in each family being usually devoted to the profession. The religious tone of the inhabitants is further exemplified by colossal figures of deities carved in the rock, stone-heaps or walls covered with inscriptions, and miscellaneous sacred structures.\n\nThe earliest mention of Lad\u00e1kh is probably to be found in the description of Kie-chha by the Chinese pilgrim Fa-Hian (300 A.D.). It appears to be referred to again in the Akhassa Regio of Pliny, and in the Mo-lo-pho or San-pho-lo of Hiuen Tsiang (middle of the 7th century). Originally it formed one of the Provinces of Tibet, governed as to temporal matters by an independent prince, and in spiritual affairs by the Grand L\u00e1ma of Lhasa. In the 10th century, when the empire of Great Tibet was finally broken up, several of the outlying Districts were erected into independent kingdoms, and Palgyi-Gon occupied Lad\u00e1kh. At the beginning of the 17th century, all the records of the temples and monasteries were destroyed by Al\u00ed Sher, chief of Skardo, which has occasioned a deplorable gap in the history of the country. The dominion of Lad\u00e1kh was much enlarged by Siunge Namgyal, who defeated the chief of Balti, although aided by Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr Sh\u00e1h. A series of wars between the Sokpos and Lad\u00e1khis ensued, but eventually in 1688 the Sokpos were driven out of Lad\u00e1kh with the assistance of the Muhammadans from Kashmir, and received Rudokh as a concession. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Lad\u00e1kh then became a Muhammadan, and from that time Lad\u00e1kh appears to have paid tribute to Kashmir.\n\nAbout the time of Moorcroft's visit to Lad\u00e1kh, in 1822, the Gyalpo, or ruler, made an offer of his allegiance to the British Government, which, unfortunately for the prosperity of Lad\u00e1kh, was refused. In 1834, Lad\u00e1kh was invaded by the Dogra troops of Ghul\u00e1b Singh, ruler of Kashmir, under the leadership of Zor\u00e1war Singh, and, with the neighbouring Province of Balti, was conquered after two campaigns. Elated at these successes, the same commander invaded Rudokh; but here the combined power of the Chinese and the piercing cold led to the practical annihilation of his army, in the very same month of the same year that a British division of about equal strength was destroyed in Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n. By a treaty of the 16th March 1846, Kashmir and its dependencies were handed over to Ghul\u00e1b Singh by the British Government, to whom they had passed on the conquest of the Punjab.\n\nIn 1867, Dr. Cayley was specially deputed to Lad\u00e1kh, to report on\nthe trade; and in 1870, a treaty was concluded between Lord Mayo and the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kashmir, providing for the appointment of two Joint Commissioners, one British and one native, for supervising the through trade; since which date annual reports on the subject have been duly submitted. Very full information will also be found in Dr. Aitchison's *Trade Products of Leh* (1874).\n\n**Ladole** (or *L\u00e1tol*).\u2014Town in Vij\u00e1pur Sub-division, Baroda State (G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r's territory). Population (1881) 5761.\n\n**L\u00e1dwa.**\u2014Town and municipality in Pipli tahsil, Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umballa) District, Punjab; situated on the unmetalled road from Pipli to Radaur, 33 miles south-east of Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 town, in lat. 29\u00b0 59' 30\" N., and long. 77\u00b0 5' E. The town was formerly the capital of a small native State, which was confiscated in 1846, owing to the conduct of its ruler, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ajit Singh, during the first Sikh campaign. The fort, the former residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, still exists, and is a substantial old building. Population (1868) 4400; (1881) 4061, namely, Hindus, 3100; Muhammadans, 916; Sikhs, 44; and Jain, 1. Number of houses, 690. Municipal income in 1881\u201382, \u00a3398, or 1s. 8\u00bdd. per head of the population. Police station and primary school.\n\n**Lah\u00e1r.**\u2014Fortified town in Gwalior State, Central India; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 11' 50\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 59' 5\" E., 6 miles east of the right or east bank of the river Sind; 50 miles east of Gwalior fort, and 85 south-east of Agra. Lah\u00e1r is chiefly noteworthy as the scene of a memorable and desperate assault by a British force in 1780. 'Captain Popham, in command of 2400 infantry, a small body of cavalry, and a detail of European artillery, with a howitzer and a few field-pieces, besieged this fort, which was found to be much stronger than had been fallaciously represented by the R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Gohad, who was anxious to have it captured from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. It was imperfectly breached; and as the light field-pieces could produce no further effect on the defences, the British commander determined to make a desperate attempt at storming. By extraordinary efforts, a lodgment was made in the place. Dreadful slaughter ensued on both sides. The enemy defended themselves with desperation; and it was not until the garrison, which had consisted of 500 men, was reduced to their kilad\u00e1r and a few of his dependants, that quarter was demanded. The British lost 125 men.'\n\n**Lah\u00e1rpur.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in S\u00edt\u00e1pur tahsil, Sit\u00e1pur District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Kheri District; on the east and south by parg\u00e1ns Bisw\u00e1n and Tambaur; and on the west by parg\u00e1ns Harg\u00e1m and Khair\u00e1b\u00e1d. Principal mart, Kesriganj, 2 miles west of Lah\u00e1rpur town. The pargan\u00e1 is divided into two portions by a ridge of land from 10 to 30 feet in height, the lands to the north of which are known as tar\u00e1i, the soil being a stiff mat\u00eddr; while to the south the soil is a\nfine dom\u00e1t. Population (1869) 84,730; (1881) 88,418, namely, males 45,988, and females 42,430. Area (at time of Settlement in 1872), 192 square miles, or 122,880 acres, of which 81,825 acres were cultivated, 22,415 acres cultivable, 1460 acres revenue-free (mud\u00edf), and 16,996 uncultivable waste. Incidence of land-tax, 1s. 10\u00bdd. per acre of total area; 2s. 2\u00bdd. per acre of assessed area, or 2s. 10\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area. The pargan\u00e1 was formed by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Todar Mall in the reign of Akbar, out of the lands of 13 tapp\u00e1s, containing 765 villages. It contained at the time of the Settlement 176 villages, held under the following tenures:\u2014T\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri, 104, and zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, 72. The principal castes among the landed proprietors are Gaur and Janw\u00e1r R\u00e1jputs, the former holding 105 villages and the latter 13. The Gaurs are descendants of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chandra Sen, who invaded S\u00edt\u00e1pur during the anarchy which ensued on the death of the Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707. The Janw\u00e1rs are known as Saindurias, from their original village of Saindur in pargan\u00e1 Kursi, whence they came into Lah\u00e1rpur before the invasion of the Gaurs. In addition to the 13 villages which they hold direct from the State, they also possess several villages in sub-settlement.\n\nLah\u00e1rpur.\u2014Town in Lah\u00e1rpur pargan\u00e1, S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh; situated 17 miles north of S\u00edt\u00e1pur town, on a road leading to Mallapur on the Gogra. Lat. 27\u00b0 42\u2032 45\u2033 N., long. 80\u00b0 56\u2032 25\u2033 E. A town of considerable extent, having a population in 1869 of 10,890, divided almost equally between Hindus and Muhammadans. Population (1881) 10,437, namely, Muhammadans, 5595; Hindus, 4827; and Jains, 15. Area of town site, 418 acres. Lah\u00e1rpur contains 1590 mud huts and 104 masonry buildings, the number of the latter steadily increasing, the banker caste being the principal builders. The public buildings consist of the usual police, post, and registry offices, with a well-attended school, and a sar\u00e1i. Thirteen mosques, 4 Musalm\u00e1n tombs, 4 Hindu and 2 Sikh temples. Good daily b\u00e1z\u00e1rs, the sales at which amount to about \u00a34000 per annum. No manufactures. The town is surrounded by extensive groves, and numerous fine trees are interspersed among the houses. Excellent and shady camping ground. Large fair held in the month of Rabi-us-sani; and the Muharram festival is celebrated with great splendour. The town was originally founded by, and named after, the Emperor Firoz Tughlak in 1370 A.D., when on his way to the shrine of Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad at Bahr\u00e1ich. Thirty years afterwards, one Lahuri, a P\u00e1s\u00ed, took possession of it, and changed its name to Lah\u00e1rpur. The P\u00e1s\u00eds were exterminated in 1418 by a Muhammadan army from Kanauj, under Shaikh T\u00e1hir Gh\u00e1zi. Subsequently the Muhammadans were ousted in 1707 by the Gaur R\u00e1jputs, who still possess most of the land in the pargan\u00e1. Lah\u00e1rpur is famous as the birthplace of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Todar Mall, Akbar\u2019s great finance minister and general.\nLahaul.\u2014Valley in Kangra District, Punjab.\u2014See Lahul.\n\nLahore.\u2014A Division (under a Commissioner) in the Punjab, lying between $30^\\circ 8'$ and $32^\\circ 33'$ N. lat., and between $73^\\circ 11' 30''$ and $75^\\circ 27'$ E. long., and comprising the three Districts of Lahore, Firozpur, and Gujranwala, each of which see separately. It is bounded on the north by Shahpur and Gujrat Districts; on the east by Sialkot and Amritsar Districts, by Kapurthala State, and by Jalandhar District; on the south by Patiala State; and on the west by Sirsa, Montgomery, and Jhang Districts. Area (1881), 8987 square miles, containing 26 towns and 3845 villages, with 323,296 occupied houses. Population (1868) 1,888,945; (1881) 2,191,517, namely, males 1,201,277, and females 990,240. Total increase for the thirteen years 1868\u20131881, 302,572, or 16.0 per cent. Number of families, 453,547. Average density of population, 244 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Muhammadans, 1,362,669, or 62.1 per cent. of the total population; Hindus, 489,286, or 22.3 per cent.; Sikhs, 330,566, or 15.1 per cent.; Jains, 2358; Parsis, 101; Christians, 6524; and \u2018others,\u2019 13. The prevailing castes or tribes are the Jats, 518,225, and Chuhras, 225,841. The former of these tribes are now almost entirely Muhammadans by conversion, and the latter is about equally divided between Muhammadans and Hindus. Indeed, in almost every caste or tribe mentioned below, there is a greater or less Muhammadan element. The principal of these tribes or castes are the following:\u2014Rajputs, 130,599; Arains, 167,747; Julahas, 82,406; Tarkhans, 79,305; Aroras, 76,521; Kumbhars, 73,709; Khattris, 63,445; Muchis, 59,173; Machhis, 55,773. The Muhammadan population by race, as distinguished from the descendants of converts, includes\u2014Shaikhs, 33,216; Khojahs, 18,257; Sayyids, 17,403; Kashmiris, 19,482; Baluchis, 9813; Pathans, 11,010; and Mughals, 5606.\n\nLahore Division contains a large urban population, numbering 342,587, or 15.6 per cent. Deducting Lahore city, however, the urban population numbers 193,218, or 8.8 per cent. Of the 3845 villages comprising the Division, 2713 contain less than five hundred inhabitants, and 689 from five hundred to a thousand. The average area under crops for the four years ending 1881, was 4365 square miles. Average annual land revenue, 1877 to 1881, \u00a3168,155; average annual gross revenue, including land, tribute, local rates, excise, and stamps, \u00a3247,892. For further details see the articles on the separate Districts of Lahore, Firozpur, and Gujranwala, which comprise the Division.\n\nLahore.\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between $30^\\circ 37'$ and $31^\\circ 54'$ N. lat., and between $73^\\circ 40' 15''$ and $75^\\circ 1' E.$ long. Area (1881), 3648 square miles. Population, 924,106.\nLahore forms the central District of the Lahore Division. It is bounded on the north-west by Gujranwala; on the north-east by Amritsar; on the south-east by the river Sutlej (Satlaj), which separates it from Firozpur District; and on the south-west by Montgomery District. It is divided into four tahsils, of which Sharakpur comprises the trans-R\u00e1vi portion of the District; and Chuni\u00e1n the south-western half of the tract between the R\u00e1vi and the Sutlej. The north-eastern half is divided between Lahore tahsil, which lies along the R\u00e1vi; and Kas\u00far tahsil, along the Sutlej. Lahore stands eleventh in order of area, and third in order of population, among the thirty-two Districts of the Province, comprising 3'42 per cent. of the total area, 4'91 per cent. of the total population, and 3'88 per cent. of the urban population of British territory. The administrative head-quarters are at Lahore City, the capital of the Punjab.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Lahore District comprises an irregular square of territory, stretching from the Sutlej (Satlaj) to the R\u00e1vi, and extending beyond the latter river far into the heart of the Rechn\u00e1 Do\u00e1b. Its surface, though mainly level, like the remainder of the Punjab plain, consists of parallel belts, having various degrees of fertility, which follow the general direction of the rivers Sutlej, R\u00e1vi, and Degh. The valleys of these three principal streams, with their intervening dorsal ridges, demarcate the country into several well-recognised tracts.\n\nBetween the Sutlej and the R\u00e1vi stretches an upland region, known as the M\u00e1njha, the original home of the Sikhs, broad and fairly cultivated towards the north, but contracting towards the south, and becoming more and more desert, till it becomes at last, in parts not reached by canal water, a mere barren steppe, interspersed with low bushes, affording forage to camels, and in favourable seasons covered with long grass much prized as pasturage for cattle. Villages only occur at rare intervals; but ruins of tanks, wells, towns, and forts prove that this desolate upland once formed the seat of a flourishing people. A high bank, running due east and west from the Sutlej, bounds the M\u00e1njha to the south; and between this bank and the river lies a fertile triangular wedge of lowland, known as the H\u00edt\u00e1r. The R\u00e1vi has only a small fringe of fruitful alluvium, from two to three miles in breadth, beyond which a tract of jungle runs north-westward to the Degh.\n\nExcept along the banks of rivers and in the canal tract described below, Lahore District is sadly wanting in fertility, owing to scarcity of water. Wherever wells can be sunk, or where water has been obtained from canals or other artificial sources, the out-turn of crops is in no way inferior to that of the neighbouring Districts, though not equal to that of the more highly favoured Districts of Si\u00e1lkot, Hoshi\u00e1rpur, or J\u00e1landhar.\n\nThe R\u00e1vi traverses the District throughout its whole length, passing\nwithin a mile of Lahore city, and dividing in places into numerous branches, which reunite after short courses. The Beas (Bi\u00e1s) and the Sutlej, which now meet just above the boundary of the District, once flowed in separate channels till they fell into the Indus; and the old bed of the Beas may still be distinctly traced close to the high bank of the M\u00e1njh\u00e1. According to the villagers, the change took place about the year 1750, in consequence of the curse of a Sikh Gur\u00fa, whose hermitage the irreverent river had destroyed. The towns of Kas\u00far and Chuni\u00e1n, besides many large villages, stand upon the edge of the ancient bank. Several important irrigation works fertilize the land throughout the District.\n\nThe Bari Do\u00e1b Canal runs down the high backbone between the Sutlej and the R\u00e1vi. The main line enters the District near Badh\u00e1na, and runs south-westwards to W\u00e1n Kh\u00e1ra in the Chuni\u00e1n talsil, whence a permanent escape has been dug to the R\u00e1vi at Alpa. The Lahore or northern branch of the same canal enters the District at Wahgeh, passes between Lahore city and the cantonment of Mi\u00e1n M\u00edr, and joins the R\u00e1vi at Ni\u00e1z Beg, a large village eight miles south-west of Lahore. The Kas\u00far branch, south of the main line, enters the District at Mughal, and terminates at Algun Hardo near the line of the Punjab Northern State Railway. The Sobr\u00e1on branch waters a small portion of the south-eastern corner of the District, and has its escape into the Sutlej. The Hasli Canal, constructed by Ali Mardan Kh\u00e1n, the famous engineer of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, which formerly provided water for the gardens and fountains at Shalim\u00e1r, near Lahore, now also feeds the Bari Do\u00e1b Canal; while three inundation cuts from the Sutlej, known as the Katora, Kh\u00e1nwah, and Soh\u00e1g, spread fertility over the triangular belt between the M\u00e1njh\u00e1 bank and the river.\n\nThe only trees indigenous to the District appear to be the kikar (Acacia arabica), sir\u00eds (Albizia Lebbek), tut or mulberry (Morus indica), and in a few places in alluvial soil, the palm tree. The jand (Indigofera atro purpurea), wana (Vitex Negundo), phul\u00e1hi (Acacia modesta), karil (Capparis aphylla), a camel thorn, are more properly shrubs, though the first three sometimes attain the growth of trees. Shisham or sissu (Dalbergia Sissoo), amb or mango (Mangifera indica), bakain (Melia Azedarach), amalt\u00e1s (Cassia fistula), barna, pipal (Ficus religiosa), bor (Ficus bengalensis), all require planting and tending for the first three or four years. Government has reserved several large tracts of waste land as fuel plantations for the railway, or grazing places for the horses employed by the military authorities, the total area under the Forest Department being 227,824 acres.\n\nWolves are still to be found in the wilder portions of the M\u00e1njh\u00e1 and the trans-R\u00e1vi tract, but they are now nearly exterminated. The opening of the Bari Do\u00e1b Canal has made this tract fertile and\nfairly populous, many new villages having been founded quite recently. Leopards and *nilgai* are occasionally met with, and antelope, ravine-deer, wild hog, hares, quails, sand-grouse, and pea-fowl are plentiful, especially in the forest plantations. Ducks, geese, cranes, wading birds, and pelicans abound along the banks of the Sutlej and its backwaters. The principal fishes found in the rivers are the *mahsir*, *katl\u00e1*, *mori*, *saul*, *sanghari*, *gawalli*, *khagg\u00e1*, *bachwa*, and *banam*. Snakes and scorpions are common. The Sutlej and the R\u00e1vi swarm with the *gharial*, or long-nosed crocodile; the *maggar*, or snubnosed crocodile, is also found in the former river.\n\n**History.**\u2014Numerous ruins of cities and wells, scattered over the now almost uninhabitable portions of the District, show that at some early period the general level of water must have stood much higher than now, and so permitted the existence of a comparatively high civilisation. Few traces, however, can be recovered of this pre-historic age; and the annals of the District coincide in the main with those of the great city from which it takes its name. Situated on the high road from Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, Lahore has been visited by every western invader from the days of Alexander onward. It long formed the centre of a confederation which repelled the advancing tide of Isl\u00e1m; it next became the capital of the Ghazni dynasty, and at a later period, stood for a short time as the head-quarters of the Mughals; while in modern times it has seen the rise of Ranjit Singh, and finally settled down into the administrative centre of a British Province.\n\nAt the time of Alexander's invasion, Lahore was probably a place of little importance; but in the 7th century, Hiuen Tsiang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, mentions it as a great Br\u00e1hmanical city, which he passed on his way to J\u00e1landhar (Jullundur). At the period of the first Muhammadan invasion, towards the end of the same century, Lahore was ruled by a Chauh\u00e1n prince of the Ajmere (Ajmir) family. For three hundred years longer, the native R\u00e1j\u00e1s held their own against all Musalm\u00e1n attacks; but towards the end of the roth century, Subuktug\u00edn, Sult\u00e1n of Ghazn\u00ed, 'like a foaming torrent, hastened toward Hindust\u00e1n,' and defeated Jai P\u00e1l of Lahore, who burnt himself to death in despair. Shortly after, the more famous Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed invaded India, defeated Anang P\u00e1l, son of Jai P\u00e1l, at Pesh\u00e1war, and after pushing his conquests farther into Hindust\u00e1n, returned thirteen years later to occupy Lahore, which remained thenceforth in the hands of one or other Muhammadan dynasty until the Sikh reaction.\n\nDuring the reigns of the first eight Ghazn\u00ed princes, Lahore was governed by viceroys; but about the year 1102, the Seljaks drove the Ghazn\u00ed Sult\u00e1n to India, and Lahore then became the capital of their race. It remained the capital of the Musalm\u00e1n Empire till Muhammad Ghori transferred the metropolis to Delhi in 1193. Under the Khilj\u00ed\nand Tughlak dynasties, Lahore makes little figure in history. In 1397, when Tim\u00far invaded India, it fell before one of his lieutenants; but the fact that the Mughal conqueror did not himself sack it in person, shows that it must then have sunk into comparative insignificance. In 1436, Bahlol Lodi, afterwards Emperor, seized upon Lahore, as a first step to power. Under his grandson Sult\u00e1n Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, Daulat Kh\u00e1n, the Afgh\u00e1n Governor of Lahore, revolted, and called in the aid of B\u00e1bar, who marched upon the city in 1524. Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm\u2019s army met him near Lahore; but B\u00e1bar defeated them with ease, and gave over the city to be plundered.\n\nIn 1526, B\u00e1bar once more invaded India; and after the decisive battle of P\u00e1n\u00edpat, took possession of Delhi, and laid the foundation of the Mughal Empire. Under that magnificent dynasty, Lahore remained at all times more or less of a royal residence, and still retains many splendid memorials of its imperial inhabitants (see LAHORE CITY). N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h passed through almost unresisted on his way to overturn the Mughal power in 1738; and the success of his invasion gave a fresh impetus to the rising enthusiasm of the Sikhs, whose tenets had been slowly spreading through the Punjab ever since the days of N\u00e1nak. In 1748, Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni took Lahore; and a period of perpetual invasion, pillage, and depopulation set in, which lasted up to the establishment of Ranjit Singh\u2019s rule. During the thirty years which followed Ahmad Sh\u00e1h\u2019s final departure in 1767, the Sikhs remained practically unmolested, and Lahore District fell into the hands of three among their chieftains, belonging to the Bhangi misl or confederacy. In 1799, Ranjit Singh took his first step toward the sovereignty of the Punjab by obtaining a grant of Lahore from the Afgh\u00e1n invader, Sh\u00e1h Zam\u00e1n. His subsequent rise to mastery over the whole Province, and the collapse of his artificial kingdom under his successors, form a chapter of imperial history (see PUNJAB). In December 1846, the Council of Regency was established, and the British Resident became the real central authority at Lahore. On 29th March 1849, on the conclusion of the second Sikh war, the young Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Dhul\u00edp Singh resigned the government to the British, and the District has ever since been constituted upon the usual administrative model.\n\nDuring the Mutiny of 1857, a plot among the native troops at Mee\u00e1n Meer, for seizing the fort of Lahore, was fortunately discovered in time and frustrated by the disarming of the mutinous regiments under the guns of a battery of horse artillery, supported by a British infantry regiment. Throughout the rebellion, Lahore continued in a disturbed state. In July, the 26th Native Infantry regiment mutinied at Mee\u00e1n Meer, and, after murdering some of their officers, succeeded in effecting their escape under cover of a dust storm. They were, however, overtaken on the banks of the R\u00e1vi, and destroyed by a force under the\ncommand of Mr. Cooper, Deputy-Commissioner of Amritsar. The strictest precautions were adopted in and around Lahore City until the fall of Delhi removed all further cause of apprehension.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1868 returned the population of Lahore District at 789,666, or 788,409 upon the area comprising the District as at present constituted. In 1881, the population was returned at 924,106, showing an increase of 135,697, or 17.2 per cent., in thirteen years. This increase is attributable to a large influx of traders, artisans, etc., and the formation of new villages resulting from the extension of canal irrigation and of the railway system through the District since 1868. The general results of the Census of 1881 may be briefly summarized as follows:\u2014Area, 3648 square miles, with 9 towns and 1477 villages; number of houses, 194,834, of which 160,296 were occupied, and 34,538 unoccupied. Total population, 924,106, namely, males 510,353, and females 413,753; proportion of males, 55.2 per cent. Average density of population, 253 persons per square mile; number of towns or villages per square mile, 42; persons per town or village (excluding Lahore City), 521. Number of houses per square mile, 53; inmates per house, 5.8. Classified according to age, there were\u2014under 15 years of age, males 191,041, and females 159,808; total children, 350,849, or 37.9 per cent. of the population; above 15 years, males 319,312, and females 253,945; total adults, 573,257, or 62.1 per cent. As regards religious distinctions, Muhammadans form the great majority of the population, numbering 599,477, or 64.8 per cent. Hindus numbered 193,319, or 20.9 per cent.; Sikhs, 125,591, or 13.6 per cent.; Christians, 4644; Jains, 970; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 92; and \u2018others,\u2019 13.\n\nAmong the ethnical divisions, the J\u00e1ts come first (157,670), and form the leading agricultural community. More than half of them (84,174) retain the ancestral creed of their Sikh or Hindu forefathers; the remainder have embraced Isl\u00e1m. The other principal castes and tribes are as follow. In almost all of them there is a greater or lesser Muhammadan element, descendants of converts from Hinduism\u2014Chuhras, 99,025; Arains, 94,964; R\u00e1jputs, 54,577; Jul\u00e1has, 35,742; Aroras, 33,136; Khattr\u00eds, 32,970; Kumbh\u00e1rs, 31,524; Tarkh\u00e1ns, 31,009; Machh\u00eds, 24,747; Tel\u00eds, 23,066; Jhinw\u00e1rs, 20,941; Br\u00e1hmans, 20,813; Moch\u00eds, 18,527; Kambohs, 17,694; Dhob\u00eds, 15,596; N\u00e1is, 13,840; Loh\u00e1rs, 13,767; Mir\u00e1s\u00eds, 11,747; Lab\u00e1nas, 10,116; Mahtams, 9551; Son\u00e1rs, 8317; Guj\u00e1rs, 7079; and Dogras, 6733. The Muhammadan population by race, as distinguished from descendants of converts, consists of\u2014Shaikhs, 17,853; Khojahs, 12,313; Kashm\u00edris, 11,659; Sayyids, 7930; Path\u00e1ns, 6976; Bal\u00fach\u00eds, 5247; and Mughals, 3676. According to sect, the Musalm\u00e1ns are returned as follows:\u2014Sunn\u00eds, 578,201; Shi\u00e1s, 3032; Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, 241; \u2018others\u2019 and unspecified, 18,003. The\nChristian population includes 3252 Europeans or Americans, 632 Eurasians, and 760 natives. According to sect, the Christian population comprises\u2014Church of England, 2535; Roman Catholics, 1001; Church of Scotland, 208; Baptists, 233; Wesleyans, 53; Protestant but otherwise unspecified, 417; Armenian Church, 20; 'others' and unspecified, 177.\n\nInstruction, both religious and secular, is afforded by a number of schools attached to the American Baptist Mission, and by the Zan\u00e1n\u00e1 and girls' schools. A Divinity School is maintained by the Church Missionary Society for the training of Native Christians as clergymen and catechists; also a female Normal School for training girls as teachers, and a Zan\u00e1n\u00e1 Mission. A branch of the Methodist Episcopal Mission was established in Lahore in 1881; but it mainly confines its efforts to out-door preaching, and up to 1883 had no church or schools or community of native Christians attached to it. The Punjab Religious Book Society, in connection with the London Religious Tract Society, was established in 1863, and has its central depository in the An\u00e1rkalli b\u00e1z\u00e1r. A number of colporteurs are employed.\n\nTown and Rural Population.\u2014Lahore District contains eight towns with a population exceeding five thousand, namely, Lahore City and suburbs, including the civil station and sadr b\u00e1z\u00e1r, 130,960; Meean Meer (Mi\u00e1n M\u00edr) cantonment (included with Lahore City in the Census Report), 18,409; Kasur, 17,336; Chunian, 8122; Patti, 6407; Khem Karn, 5516; Raja Jang, 5187; and Sur Singh, 5104. Two other towns are municipalities, with a population of less than five thousand, namely, Sharakpur, 4595, and Khudian, 2917. Total urban population, 204,553, or 22.1 per cent. of the District population. Deducting Lahore City and Meean Meer cantonment, however, the urban population amounts to only 55,184, or 7.1 per cent., as against a rural population of 719,553, or 92.8 per cent. Of the 1486 towns and villages in the District, 465 are returned as having less than two hundred inhabitants; 559 from two to five hundred; 279 from five hundred to a thousand; 138 from one to two thousand; 25 from two to three thousand; 13 from three to five thousand; 5 from five to ten thousand; 1 from fifteen to twenty thousand; and 1 upwards of fifty thousand inhabitants.\n\nThe villages generally possess a common site, on which all the habitations of the residents are gathered together in a cluster of mud huts. A deep pond, out of the excavations of which the huts have been built, lies on one side of every village; the water out of the pond being used for the cattle to drink from, for the village clothes to be cleaned in, and sometimes even for drinking purposes. In addition to this, there is generally a tall pipal or other tree affording shelter for\nvillage assemblies, or the accommodation of travellers; also a *takia* or *masjid* for religious observances. The houses and courtyards are generally huddled together, with narrow lanes between them; dirty and badly drained, and often the receptacles for all dirt and filth. The house, even of a prosperous agriculturist, looks but a poor abode, built of mud or clay, with a thatched roof in the neighbourhood of the villages, but in other places with flat mud roofs. The house generally consists of one or two small dark rooms, with no opening but the door; having a large courtyard in front, where the family live and follow their occupations all day long, while the head of the household is away in his fields.\n\nThe food of the cultivating classes consists of the commoner grains, such as gram, *moth*, Indian corn, *china*, etc., ground and kneaded with water, and made into round flat cakes or *chapatis*. Before the opening of the B\u00e2ri Do\u00e1b Canal, wheat was seldom eaten save as a luxury, or on occasions of festivity. Since the introduction of irrigation, the cultivation of this crop has increased so much that it will probably soon become the staple food of the people. Rice is too expensive to be much used by the poorer classes, for it has to be brought from a distance. Meat, particularly the flesh of the goat and kid, is eaten by those who can afford it. The people are very fond of curds, whey, and butter-milk, and for vegetables they use the leaves of the mustard plant. Salt is an indispensable accompaniment to every meal, and is also largely given to the cattle. Among the cultivating classes, the R\u00e1jput Musalm\u00e1ns are, as a rule, deeply in debt; but the J\u00e1ts are more independent of the village banker in Lahore than in many other Punjab Districts, and are more economical. They, however, resort to the bankers on every occasion of want. As regards the commercial and industrial classes, it may be said generally that a large proportion of the artisans in the towns are extremely poor; while those in the villages are scarcely less dependent on the harvest than are the agriculturists themselves, their fees often taking the form of a fixed share of the produce.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census Report of 1881 returned the adult male population under the following seven classes:\u2014(1) Professional class, including all Government officials, civil and military, and the learned professions, 21,113; (2) domestic and menial class, 36,508; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 10,716; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 117,975; (5) industrial and manufacturing class, 79,153; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, including labourers, 37,973; (7) unspecified, 15,874.\n\n*Agriculture.*\u2014According to the Punjab Administration Report for 1883\u201384, out of a total District area of 2,364,887 acres, 1,156,385 acres were under cultivation, 159,545 acres were grazing land, 738,156\nacres were cultivable, and 310,801 acres were uncultivable waste. Of the cultivated area, 548,688 acres were artificially irrigated, 239,808 acres from Government works, and 308,880 acres by private individuals from wells, etc. The great crop of the District is the rabi or spring harvest. The principal staples of this harvest, and their area in 1883\u201384, are as follow:\u2014Wheat, 393,070 acres, now the great agricultural product of the District since the opening up of the formerly sterile tract of the M\u00e1njh\u00e1 by the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b Canal. The best variety is grown in the villages around Lahore city. Gram occupies 188,459 acres; barley, 34,597 acres; mustard seed, 13,729 acres; and vegetables, 10,626 acres. The kharif or autumn harvest is mainly devoted to inferior grains and fodder for cattle. Rice occupies 15,609 acres, the best kinds being grown along the banks of the Degh, and in the b\u00e1ngar tract of Sharakpur tahsil. Jo\u00e1r is the principal kharif crop, and occupies 62,809 acres; Indian corn, 46,643 acres; moth, 34,793 acres. Of non-food crops, cotton is the most important, and is cultivated on 33,961 acres. It is grown in the lowlands of Chuni\u00e1n and Kas\u00far between the old bed of the Beas and the Sutlej. It is, however, of inferior quality, and is mainly employed for home consumption. The principal fruits cultivated in the District are\u2014mangoes, peaches, oranges of superior quality, mulberries, plums, loquats, melons, guavas, pine-apples, phalsa (an acid berry), pomegranates, sweet limes, and plantains.\n\nThe average out-turn per acre for the different crops is thus returned in 1883\u201384:\u2014Rice, 1033 lbs.; wheat, 749 lbs.; gram, 941 lbs.; barley, 726 lbs.; bajra, 378 lbs.; jo\u00e1r, 477 lbs.; inferior grains, 488 lbs.; cotton, 393 lbs.; tobacco, 689 lbs.; oil-seeds, 366 lbs.; and fibres, 264 lbs. The use of manure hardly extends beyond the lands immediately adjacent to the villages. Round the city of Lahore, however, it is employed with great effect, as many as three crops being sometimes taken from the same field within the year.\n\nThe village tenures fall under the three ordinary Punjab types, but that known as pattid\u00e1ri prevails in a large majority of cases. The peasant proprietors in most instances cultivate their own lands. At the time of the Settlement of 1869, 76,147 proprietors owned 1,703,187 acres; and 57,715 tenants held 336,851 acres. The final results of the Settlement, as regards tenant-right, were as follows:\u2014Tenants with rights of occupancy, 13,119 holdings; tenants holding conditionally, 3214 holdings; tenants-at-will, 34,700 holdings. Cash rents hardly exist, and rentals mainly depend, not upon free competition, but upon custom and the caste of the tenant. Cash rates are now becoming more common, being forced up by competition. The rates current at the Settlement of 1869 are thus described: \u2018Of 51,715 tenants, 27,798 cultivating 182,995 acres pay their rent in produce, and only 23,917\nholding 153,856 acres pay in cash, or are free of rent. Of the land held by tenants paying their rent in kind, there are as many as 115,856 acres, which yield one-fourth produce to the landlords; 11,084 acres, paying half; 6745 acres, paying two-fifths; and 49,310, paying one-third.' On unirrigated land, half or one-third of the gross produce forms the average rate; on irrigated land, one-fourth may be regarded as a fair proportion.\n\nPrices of food-grains ruled as follows in 1880:\u2014 Wheat, 16 sers per rupee, or 7s. per cwt.; barley, 17 sers per rupee, or 6s. 4d. per cwt.; gram, 20 sers per rupee, or 5s. 7d. per cwt.; bajra, 19 sers per rupee, or 6s. per cwt. These prices were exceptionally high. On the 1st January 1884, the ruling rates for food-grains were as follows:\u2014 Wheat, 25 sers per rupee, or 4s. 6d. per cwt.; barley, 40 sers per rupee, or 2s. 10d. per cwt.; gram, 38 sers per rupee, or 3s. per cwt.; joar, 38 sers per rupee, or 3s. per cwt.; and bajra, 26 sers per rupee, or 4s. 4d. per cwt. Skilled labourers are paid at the rate of from 6d. to 1s. a day, and unskilled labourers, from 3d. to 6d. a day.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Famines, due to drought, occurred before the British occupation in 1759, 1783, 1813, and 1833. Since the British assumed administration, the greatest scarcities have taken place in 1860 and 1867; but Lahore District suffered comparatively little, except from the exportation of its produce to other quarters. Grain rose to 7 sers per rupee, or 16s. per cwt. Poorhouses and famine relief works were set on foot, but they proved useful chiefly to the starving refugees from Malwa, Hissar, and the eastern Districts. The construction of the Bari Doab Canal will probably serve in future to protect the naturally fertile uplands of Lahore from drought. Hail-storms, locusts, and rats sometimes cause considerable damage to the standing crops.\n\nCommerce, Trade, etc.\u2014The trade of the District centres mainly in the city of Lahore. The chief manufactures comprise silk, cotton, wool, and metal work, none of them of more than local importance. The agricultural produce formerly did not suffice for local consumption, and large quantities of grain were imported to supply the city. Since the opening of the Bari Doab Canal, however, enormous quantities of wheat and oil-seeds are exported from the Manjha uplands. The main line of the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway terminates at Lahore, and has stations at Meean Meer and Jalal. A section of the Indus Valley Railway runs to Sher Shah on the Chenab, below Multan (Mooltan), and is continued to Karachi (Kurrachee) and the sea; and a branch line, constructed in 1883, connects Raiwind, a station on the Karachi branch of the railway, with Ganda Singhwala on the Sutlej opposite Firozpur. On the other side, the Northern Punjab State Railway leads towards Peshawar and the north-west frontier. The Grand Trunk Road enters the District from the east, crosses the Ravi\nand the Sutlej by bridges of boats, and from Lahore turns nearly due north on its way to Peshawar. Other roads connect the capital with surrounding cities and with the lesser towns of the District. The total length of communications is returned as follows:\u2014Navigable rivers, 104 miles; railways, 144 miles; metalled roads, $13\\frac{1}{2}$ miles; unmetalled roads, 703 miles. Lines of telegraph run to Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umballa), Peshawar, and M\u00falt\u00e1n (Mooltan), besides the railway wires, which last are also open to the public.\n\n**Administration.**\u2014Lahore District is under the Commissioner of the Lahore Division, who is assisted by an Additional Commissioner. The District staff ordinarily comprises a Deputy Commissioner, with 1 Judicial Assistant, 2 Assistant and 3 extra-Assistant Commissioners, besides the usual fiscal, constabulary, and medical officers. In 1882\u201383, 18 civil and revenue judges and 22 magistrates dispensed justice. The imperial revenue in 1872\u201373 amounted to \u00a395,285, of which sum \u00a361,031, or nearly two-thirds, was contributed by the land-tax. In 1882\u201383, the total revenue was returned at \u00a3121,537, of which \u00a372,965 was contributed by the land-tax, fixed and fluctuating, the other chief items being stamps, \u00a326,360; excise, \u00a315,701; and local rates, \u00a36510. The District fund showed an income (derived from provincial rates), in 1882\u201383, of \u00a37660; the expenditure, mainly on education, public works, medical services, post-office, etc., being \u00a34954. In 1882\u201383, the regular police force numbered 843 officers and men, supplemented by a municipal constabulary of 447 men, and a cantonment police of 67 men at Meean Meer (Mi\u00e1n Mir), besides a few constables supplied to private companies. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property amounted to 1357 policemen, being at the rate of 1 man to every 581 of the population and every 2'68 square miles of area. In addition to this force, there is a village watch of 1077 chaukid\u00e1rs, receiving a pay of 6s. per month, derived either from a description of octroi, or from a small house tax. The total number of persons brought to trial for all offences committed within the District in 1882 was 12,195. The central jail at Lahore serves as a receiving jail for long-term convicts from other parts of the Province. In 1882 it contained a daily average of 2004 prisoners. During the same year, the female penitentiary, also a Provincial prison, had a daily average of 193 inmates. The District jail in the same year contained an average of 556 prisoners.\n\nIncluding the Oriental College affiliated to the Punjab University, the Lahore Government College, Training College, the Normal Schools, School of Art, Law School, Veterinary School, Zan\u00e1na Mission Schools, the St. John\u2019s Divinity School (under the management of the Church Missionary Society), the Schools of the American Presbyterian Mission, and several schools for European children, education was carried on in\nthe District in 1882-83 by 378 aided and unaided schools, having an aggregate roll of 9277 pupils, and maintained at a cost of \u00a36724. The Census of 1881 returned a total of 9815 boys and 657 girls as able to read and write, besides 27,690 males and 917 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. A School of Industry for the instruction of boys in different branches of native handicrafts after leaving their village schools, was established at Kas\u00far in 1874, and is attended by a daily average of 30 pupils. A staff of master artisans is maintained to teach the boys cloth and carpet weaving, leather work, metal work, tailoring, and embroidery. The weaving industry is the special feature of the institution; and the work turned out is much sought after.\n\nFor fiscal and administrative purposes, the District is divided into the 4 tahsils or Sub-divisions of Lahore, Kas\u00far, Chuni\u00e1n, and Sharakpur. In 1882 it contained 7 municipal towns, namely, Lahore, Kas\u00far, Khem Karn, Chuni\u00e1n, Sharakpur, Patti, and Khud\u00ed\u00e1n. Their aggregate revenue amounted to \u00a341,381, or 4s. 6d. per head of the total population (181,711) within municipal limits.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The District bears a good reputation for general healthiness, though the heat for four or five months reaches an excessive intensity, the thermometer sometimes ranging even at night as high as 105\u00b0 F. In 1882, the recorded temperature in the shade was as follows for three selected months:\u2014May, maximum 116\u00b75\u00b0 F., minimum 62\u00b78\u00b0, mean 88\u00b78\u00b0; July, maximum 111\u00b75\u00b0, minimum 75\u00b74\u00b0, mean 88\u00b76\u00b0; December, maximum 78\u00b77\u00b0, minimum 39\u00b75\u00b0, mean 58\u00b76\u00b0 F. The average annual rainfall for the seventeen years ending 1882-83 was 17\u00b78 inches for the District as a whole, varying from a minimum of 12\u00b74 inches in Sharakpur, to 23\u00b79 inches at Meean Meer, and 18\u00b76 inches at Lahore city. September and October form the unhealthiest season of the year; and the valleys of the two great rivers are centres of endemic disease, especially fever.\n\nThe vital statistics of 1882 show a total of 26,049 recorded deaths, being at the rate of 28 per thousand. Of these, 17,443, or 18\u00b787 per thousand, were assigned to fever alone. The District contains five Government charitable dispensaries\u2014the Mayo Hospital in Lahore, at Kas\u00far, at Meean Meer (Mi\u00e1n M\u00edr), Sharakpur, and Chuni\u00e1n. In 1882 they gave relief to a total of 62,215 persons, of whom 2785 were in-patients. Besides these local dispensaries there are also the Medical College, Mayo Hospital, Veterinary School, and Lunatic Asylum, which are all Central Provincial Institutions.\n\n[For further information regarding Lahore, see the Gazetteer of the Lahore District, published under the authority of the Punjab Government in 1883-84; the Report on the Revised Land Settlement of Lahore District, between 1865 and 1869 (Central Jail Press, Lahore, 1873),\nby Mr. Leslie S.

Area, 740 square miles, with (1881) 376 towns and villages, 60,082 occupied houses, and 89,009 families. Total population, 370,796, namely, males 209,164, and females 161,632; proportion of males in total population, 56.4 per cent. Average density of population, 501 persons per square mile; average number of persons per town or village, excluding Lahore city, 609. Classified according to religion, the Muhammadans form the bulk of the population, numbering 234,500 in 1881; Hindus, 91,379; Sikhs, 49,144; Jains, 228; Parsis, 92; Christians, 4440; and 'others,' 13. Of the 376 towns and villages, 234 contain less than five hundred inhabitants, and 79 between five hundred and a thousand. The average annual area under cultivation for the five years from 1877-78 to 1881-82 was 253,199 acres, the area under the principal crops being\u2014Wheat, 92,241 acres; rice, 6538 acres; jo\u00e1r, 19,268 acres; Indian corn, 11,343 acres; barley, 9222 acres; gram, 37,825 acres; moth, 7536 acres; cotton, 12,622 acres; vegetables, 2777 acres; and sugar-cane, 1444 acres. Total revenue, \u00a320,066. The administrative staff, including the Divisional and District head-quarters, consists of a Commissioner with an Assistant, Deputy Commissioner with a Judicial Assistant, and six extra-Assistant Commissioners, a Cantonment Magistrate at Mee\u00e1n Meer, a Judge of the Small Cause Court, a tahsild\u00e1r, a munsif, and nine honorary magistrates, exercising criminal jurisdiction only. These officers preside over 14 civil and 13 criminal courts. Number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 7; strength of regular police, 490 men; besides 322 village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs).\n\n**Lahore.**\u2014City and capital of the Punjab Province, and administrative head-quarters of Lahore Division and District. Lat. 31\u00b0 34' 5\" N., long. 74\u00b0 21' E. Situated 1 mile south of the river R\u00e1vi, amid the debris and ruins of the ancient city, whose area the modern town does not nearly cover.\n\n**History and Architectural Remains.**\u2014Hindu tradition traces the origin of Lahore to R\u00e1m\u00e1, the hero of the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, whose two sons, Loh and Kash, founded the sister towns of Lahore and Kas\u00far. The name has probably been corrupted from Loh\u00e1war, or from a still earlier Sanskrit form, Loh\u00e1war\u00e1na. Though little can now be recovered with regard to the date of its foundation, the absence of all mention in Alexander's historians, and the fact that coins of the Gr\u00e6co-Bactrian kings are not found among the ruins, lead to the belief that Lahore\ndid not exist as a town of any importance during the earliest period of Indian history. On the other hand, Hiuen Tsiang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, notices the city in his *Itinerary*; and it seems probable, therefore, that Lahore first rose into eminence between the 1st and 7th centuries of our era. Its condition under the native Hindu and early Musalm\u00e1n dynasties belongs rather to the general annals of Lahore District. Governed originally by a family of Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jputs, a branch of the house of Ajmere (Ajm\u00edr), Lahore fell successively under the dominion of the Ghazn\u00ed and Ghori Sult\u00e1ns, who made it the capital of their Indian conquests, and adorned it with numerous buildings, almost all now in ruins.\n\nBut it was under the Mughal Empire that Lahore reached its greatest size and magnificence. The reigns of Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, Akbar, Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, and Aurangzeb, form the golden period in the annals and architecture of the city. Akbar enlarged and repaired the fort, and surrounded the town with a wall, portions of which still remain, built into the modern work of Ranjit Singh. Specimens of the mixed Hindu and Saracenic style adopted by Akbar survive within the fort, though largely defaced by later alterations. Under that great Emperor, Lahore rapidly increased in area and population. The most thickly inhabited portion covered the site of the existing town, but long b\u00e1z\u00e1srs and populous suburbs spread over the now desolate tract without the walls. Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr also frequently resided at Lahore, and it was here that his son Khusru rebelled against him. During his reign, the Sikh Guru, Arj\u00fan Mall, compiler of the *Adi Granth*, died in prison at Lahore; and the humble shrine of the first Sikh martyr still stands between the Mughal palace and the mausoleum of Ranjit Singh. Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr erected the greater Khw\u00e1bghah or 'Sleeping Palace,' the Mot\u00ed Masjid or 'Pearl Mosque,' and the tomb of An\u00e1rkalli, still used as a station church, although a handsome cathedral church is now (1885) in course of construction. The palace originally consisted of a large quadrangle, surrounded on three sides by a colonnade of red stone pillars, having their capitals intricately carved with figures of peacocks, elephants, and griffins. In the centre of the fourth side, overlooking the R\u00e1vi, stood a lofty pavilion in the Mughal style, flanked by two chambers with elaborately decorated verandahs of Hindu architecture. A garden filled the interior space of the quadrangle, with a raised platform of marble mosaic; while beneath the colonnade and pavilion, underground chambers afforded cool retreats from the mid-day sun. But Sikh and European alterations have largely disfigured the beauty of this building, the pavilion having been transformed into a mess-room, and the colonnades walled in to form officers' quarters.\n\nJah\u00e1ng\u00edr's mausoleum at Sh\u00e1hdra forms one of the chief ornaments of Lahore, though even this has suffered somewhat from depredations.\nThe marble dome, which once rose over the tomb, was removed by Aurangzeb. The tombs of N\u00far-Jah\u00e1n, his devoted wife, and of her brother Asaf Kh\u00e1n, have fared worse, having been stripped of their marble facings and coloured enamels by the Sikhs. Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n erected a smaller palace by the side of his father's building, the beauty of which can still be discerned through the inevitable whitewash which covers the marble slabs and hides the depredations of the Sikhs. To the same Emperor is due the range of buildings to the left of the Khw\u00e1bghah, with octagonal towers, the largest of which, known as the Saman B\u00farj, contains the exquisite pavilion, inlaid with flowers wrought in precious stones, which derives its name of the Naulaka from its original cost of 9 l\u00e1khs; together with the Shish Mahal, afterwards the reception-room of Ranjit Singh, and interesting as the place where Dhulip Singh made over the sovereignty of the Punjab to the British Government.\n\nUnder Aurangzeb, Lahore began to decline in population. Even before his time, the foundation of Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d or modern Delhi had drawn away the bulk of the classes dependent upon the court; and the constant absence of the Emperor contributed still more to depress the city. Aurangzeb also constructed an embankment for three miles along the R\u00e1vi, to prevent inundations, but with such undesirable success that the river completely altered its course, and left the town at a considerable distance. Among his other works, the Jam\u00e1 Masjid or 'Great Mosque' ranks first, a stiff and somewhat ungraceful piece of architecture, which, by its poverty of detail, contrasts with the gorgeous profuseness of Agra and Delhi.\n\nWith the reign of Aurangzeb, the architectural history of Lahore may be said to close, later attempts marking only the rapid decadence of art, which culminated in the tawdry erections of the Sikhs. From the accession of Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h till the establishment of Ranjit Singh's authority at the beginning of the present century, the annals of Lahore consist of successive invasions and conquests by N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h, Ahmad Sh\u00e1h, and many less famous depredators (see LAHORE DISTRICT). The magnificent city of the Mughal princes and their viceroys sank into a mere heap of ruins, containing a few scattered houses and a couple of Sikh forts within its shrunken walls; while outside, a wide expanse of broken remains marked the site of the decaying suburbs which once surrounded the capital.\n\nBut the rise of Ranjit Singh's empire made Lahore once more the centre of a flourishing though ephemeral kingdom. The great Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 stripped the Muhammadan tombs of their ornaments, which he sent to decorate the temple at Amritsar; but he restored the Shalim\u00e1r gardens, erected a really beautiful b\u00e1r\u00e1ddari in the space between the palace and the Jam\u00e1 Masjid, and also built a number of minor erections in the\nvery worst taste. His mausoleum, a mixed work of Hindu and Muhammadan architecture, forms one of the latest specimens of Sikh workmanship.\n\nIn 1846, the British Council of Regency was established at Lahore; and in 1849, the young Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Dhul\u00edp Singh transferred the government of the Punjab to the East India Company. Lahore thenceforth became the capital of a British Province, and a new impetus was given to its rising prosperity. In 1849, the environs still remained a mere expanse of crumbling ruins, and the houses of the first European residents clustered around the old cantonment, on a strip of alluvial lowland, south of the town, running parallel to a former bed of the R\u00e1v\u00ed. Gradually, however, the station spread eastward; and now a new town covers a large part of the area once given over to ruins and jungle, while every year sees fresh additions to the renovated capital.\n\nGeneral Appearance, Modern Buildings, etc.\u2014Modern Lahore covers an area of 640 acres, surrounded by a brick wall, which formerly rose to a height of 30 feet, and was strengthened by a moat and other defences. But the moat has been filled in, and the wall lowered to a uniform elevation of 16 feet. A garden now occupies the site of the trench, and encircles the city on every side except the north. Though built upon an alluvial plain, the d\u00e9bris of ages has raised the present town to a position upon a considerable mound. A metalled road runs round the outer side of the rampart, and gives access to the city by 13 gates. The citadel or fort rises upon a slight but commanding eminence at the north-eastern angle, and abuts northward on the old river bed, while the esplanade stretches over an open space to the south and east.\n\nWithin the city, narrow and tortuous streets, ending in culs-de-sac, and lined by tall houses, give Lahore a mean and gloomy appearance; but the magnificent buildings of the Mughal period serve to relieve the general dulness of its domestic architecture. On the north-eastern side especially, the Mosque of Aurangzeb, with its plain white marble domes and simple minarets, the mausoleum of Ranjit Singh, with its rounded roof and projecting balconies, and the desecrated fa\u00e7ade of the Mughal palace, stand side by side in front of an open grassy plain, exhibiting one of the grandest coups-d\u2019\u0153il to be seen in India.\n\nOutside the wall, with a general southerly direction, lies the European quarter. From the Loh\u00e1ri gate, the long street known as the An\u00e1rkalli or Sadr B\u00e1z\u00e1r stretches southward, joining the native town to the civil station and abandoned cantonment of An\u00e1rkalli. This portion of the new quarter contains the secretariat, financial offices, chief court, and station church. From An\u00e1rkalli the civil station now runs three miles eastward to the Lawrence Gardens and Government House, the extension in this direction being known as Donald Town, from the late Lieutenant-\nGovernor, Sir Donald McLeod. A broad road, called the Mall, cuts through the centre of the station, and connects this growing suburb with Anarkalli. North of the Mall, now largely built over, lies the railway station, surrounded by the bungalows of its employ\u00e9s. South of the Mall, again, the suburb of Muzang contains many European residences. The chief public buildings and institutions include the Punjab University, with its Senate Hall (endowed by several native R\u00e1j\u00e1s and Naw\u00e1bs), the Oriental College, the Lahore Government College, the Medical School, the Central Training College, Law School, Veterinary School, the Lahore High School, the Mayo Hospital (a fine building near the An\u00e1rkalli b\u00e1z\u00e1r, capable of accommodating 110 patients), the Museum, the Roberts Institute for European clerks, the Lawrence and Montgomery Halls, and the Agri-Horticultural Society.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of Lahore city and suburbs, including the cantonment of Meean Meer (Mi\u00e1n M\u00edr), was returned at 125,413 in 1868. By 1881 the population had risen to 149,369, namely, males 87,743, and females 61,626, showing an increase of 23,956, or 19 per cent., in thirteen years. Classified according to religion, the population of the city, suburbs, and cantonment in 1881 was composed as follows:\u2014Muhammadans, 86,413; Hindus, 53,641; Sikhs, 4627; Jains, 227; \u2018others,\u2019 4461. Number of occupied houses, 24,077. The military cantonment of Meean Meer (Mi\u00e1n M\u00edr) lies 3 miles east of the civil station and 6 miles from the city, and forms the head-quarters of the Lahore Military Division. The ordinary garrison consists of two batteries of Royal Artillery, one of Bengal Cavalry, one regiment of British infantry, one of Native infantry, and one of Punjab Pioneers. Total strength of garrison in July 1883, 3692 officers and men. The total population of the cantonment in 1881 was 18,409. The fort of Lahore is garrisoned by small detachments from Meean Meer. The 1st and 3rd Punjab Volunteer Rifles have their head-quarters at Lahore.\n\nCommerce, Communications, etc.\u2014Lahore possesses comparatively little trade, its business being almost confined to the importation of supplies for the consumption of the inhabitants. Small manufactures of silk and gold or silver lace form the chief source of export trade. The total value of the commerce of Lahore in 1871\u201372 was\u2014imports, \u00a3333,834; exports, \u00a312,395. By 1881\u201382, the imports of Lahore had increased to \u00a3790,711; and the exports to \u00a3116,837. Railways now connect the capital with most other parts of the Province, and complete the circuit to the frontier and the sea. The terminus of the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi line is at Lahore, and a branch to Sher Sh\u00e1h on the Chen\u00e1b unites the Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) and Kotri line with the Punjab system. The Northern State Railway runs to Pesh\u00e1war. The Grand Trunk Road also passes through\nLahore, and lines of telegraph afford communication with Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umballa), Pesh\u00e1war, and M\u00falt\u00e1n (Mooltan). Up till 1881, Lahore was chiefly dependent upon well-water for drinking purposes; but in June of that year, a regular system of water-works, calculated to supply an average of 10 gallons of pure water per head of the population, was opened; its advantages are now much appreciated by the townspeople, although at first there was a good deal of caste prejudice against using the water. The thorough drainage of the city has also been effected since 1881. Accommodation for travellers is provided by numerous hotels; and besides several places of business of European tradesmen and merchants, the Bank of Bengal, Agra Bank, Simla Bank, and Alliance Bank of Simla have all branches in Lahore. The internal affairs of the city are managed by a municipal committee. The income is mainly derived from an octroi duty. Municipal revenue in 1875\u201376, \u00a316,558, or 2s. 6\u00bed. per head of population (128,441) within municipal limits. In 1881, the population of the municipality, including certain suburbs, but excluding the cantonment of Meean Meer, was 138,878. Total income in 1882\u201383, \u00a336,407, of which \u00a324,995 was derived from octroi; average incidence of municipal revenue, 5s. 2\u00bed.; incidence of taxation, 3s. 7\u00bcd. per head.\n\n**Lahori Bandar.**\u2014Village in Kar\u00e1chi District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; situated in lat. 24\u00b0 32' N., and long. 67\u00b0 28' E., on the south or left bank of the Baghi\u00e1r or western branch of the Indus, 20 miles from the Piti mouth. In consequence of the channel on which it is situated having ceased to be navigable, Lahori Bandar has fallen into complete decay; but, according to Thornton, it was once the principal port in Sind, being accessible for ships of 200 tons burden. At the close of the last century there was an English factory here.\n\n**L\u00e1hul (Lahaul).**\u2014Sub-division of K\u00e1ngra District, Punjab, lying between 32\u00b0 8' and 32\u00b0 59' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 49' and 77\u00b0 46' 30\" E. long.; and comprising the valley between the Chamba mountains on the north-west, and the Kanzam range on the south-east. Area, 2255 square miles. Population (1881) 5860. L\u00e1hul is bounded on the north-west by Chamba, on the north-east by the R\u00fapshu Sub-division of Lad\u00e1kh, on the south-west by K\u00e1ngra and K\u00falu, and on the south-east by Spiti. For administrative purposes, it forms part of the K\u00falu tahsil.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014L\u00e1hul consists of an elevated and rugged Him\u00e1layan valley, traversed by the snow-fed torrents of the Chandra and the Bh\u00e1ga, which take their rise on the slopes of the B\u00e1ra L\u00e1cha Pass, at an elevation of nearly 16,500 feet above sea-level. At T\u00e1ndi the sister streams unite to form the great river Chen\u00e1b, here known as the Chandra-Bh\u00e1ga, which flows immediately into Chamba on its way to the Punjab plain. On either side of the two river glens, and in the\ntriangular space between them, the mountains rise to the level of perpetual snow, leaving only a narrow strip of wild valley fringing the streams themselves. To the north-east, the peaks about the B\u00e1ra L\u00e1cha pass tower to a height of from 19,000 to 21,000 feet; while the pass itself, the least elevated part of the whole range, is 16,221 feet above sea-level. Between the two rivers, an isolated mass of mountains attains still greater dimensions, consisting of one almost unbroken ice-field, with, at rare intervals, impassable barriers of naked rock. South of the highest peak, 21,415 feet above the sea, a glacier stretches downward for 12 miles; while east and west the hills, though slightly inferior in elevation, still reach the limits of the snow-line, and flank the valley on every side, except along the narrow outlet of the Chen\u00e1b. In such a waste of rock and ice, villages can only be planted in a few comparatively favoured spots, among the lower valleys of the Chandra and the Bh\u00e1ga, from old Koksar on the former to Darcha on the latter river. The remainder of L\u00e1hul is completely uninhabited, except for a few weeks in summer, when the K\u00falu shepherds bring up their flocks for pasturage. Picturesque knots of houses, however, nestle here and there in sheltered nooks, amid green irrigated fields, made beautiful by the exquisite Himalayan flora. Quaint conical buildings, erected in honour of some saint or Lama, stand just outside the villages; while, on the hillside above, the white walls and flying flags of some tiny Buddhist monastery give animation to the scene. The inhabited portions of the L\u00e1hul valley have an estimated elevation of 10,000 feet above sea-level. Kangser, the highest village, stands at a height of 11,345 feet. The fact that the main road to Lad\u00e1kh and Yarkand runs through the valley, from the Rohtang Pass to the B\u00e1ra L\u00e1cha, lends a certain degree of importance to this otherwise insignificant tract. The road is now (1884) in excellent order, and is annually growing in favour with the traders.\n\nHistory.\u2014The L\u00e1hul valley is mentioned as early as the 7th century in the Itinerary of Hiuen Tsiang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, who notices it under the name of Lo-hu-lo, as a district lying north-east of K\u00falu. In the earliest times, it probably formed a dependency of the Tibetan kingdom; and on the disruption of that empire in the 10th century, it seems to have been included in the principality of Lad\u00e1kh. We have no information to show the period at which it became independent, though reasons have been adduced for believing that that event preceded the reorganization of Lad\u00e1kh about 1580. An epoch of native rule under petty chiefs (Th\u00e1kurs) ensued, during which the various local families appear to have paid tribute to Chamba. Four or five of these families have survived up to the present day, and are still in possession of their original territories, which they hold in j\u00e1gir, subject to the payment of tribute or nazar\u00e1na. About the year 1700, the\nsupremacy passed to K\u00falu, in the reign of Budh Singh, son of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jagat Singh, a contemporary of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n and Aurangzeb. Thenceforward, L\u00e1hul followed the fortunes of K\u00falu, until they passed together under British rule in 1846.\n\n**Population.**\u2014In 1855, the population of L\u00e1hul amounted to only 2535 persons. By 1868, the number had risen to 5970. In 1881, the population was returned at 5860. The slight decrease, however, is believed to be more apparent than real. The Census of 1868 was taken at a time of year when the passes were open; while that of 1881 shows the winter population only, when numbers of the inhabitants were away in K\u00falu or Simla. The Th\u00e1kurs form the gentry of the valley, which they ruled until a recent period. They are pure Bhutias or Tibetans by blood, but affect a R\u00e1jput ancestry. The Kanets, who make up the mass of the population, have a mixed Indian and Mongolian origin, the latter element predominating. In religion, the people belong to the Buddhist faith, though a Hinduizing tendency exhibits itself in the distinctions of caste and the prohibition of beef as an article of food, a tendency which is much encouraged by the Th\u00e1kurs. A few pure Hindus, of Br\u00e1hman rank, live in the lower villages, while a mixture of the two faiths occurs commonly in the intervening tract, although they have all returned themselves as Hindus in the Census Report. The use of the Tibetan praying-wheel is nevertheless almost universal. Numerous monasteries stud the hills, the largest being that of Guru Gant\u00e1l, at the point of confluence of the Chandra and Bh\u00e1ga rivers. Polyandry was formerly customary throughout L\u00e1hul, but is now fast dying out; the practice is generally considered shameful, and is not admitted to exist by the people themselves. The L\u00e1hulis bear a good character as peaceable and honest mountaineers, but are much addicted to drunkenness and unchastity. The chief villages are Kielang, Kardong, and Kolang.\n\nThe houses in L\u00e1hul are two and sometimes three storeys high, with flat roofs. The lower storey is occupied by the cattle, horses, sheep, and goats; the upper one contains the rooms lived in by the family. Ordinarily the upper storey consists of an interior or winter room, an outer or summer room, and a verandah room open on the fourth side. In this verandah stands the loom; inside will be found large corn-chests made of slate set in wooden frames, large stone bowls from Isk\u00e1rdo, iron cauldrons, and cooking-pots, an iron tripod or pot-stand, some wooden dishes, and a few earthen pots from K\u00falu. Many pack-saddles for sheep and goats are strewed about, and a few blankets and thick sheep-skin coats hang on the walls. Small holes in the wall serve the purpose both of windows and chimneys; bedsteads are unknown. Grass is stacked on the roof, and wood for fuel inside. Many of the houses are built together in one block with connecting passages, by\nwhich communication is kept up in the winter without going out, which when the snow is very deep, may be scarcely possible. Spinning thread is the chief occupation in winter; on fine days the loom is brought out, and some weaving done. Both men and women work the loom. The Moravian Church has a mission station at Kielang village, with a small following of about 30 members.\n\nAgriculture, Trade, etc.\u2014Out of a total area of 2255 square miles, only 5 square miles are returned as under cultivation. Barley forms the principal crop, but wheat grows in the lower glens. Cultivation depends entirely on small irrigation canals, constructed and kept in repair by the village landowners. The grain produced does not suffice for local consumption, and has therefore to be supplemented by imports from K\u00falu. The L\u00e1hulis hold in their hands the trade between Lad\u00e1kh and Central Asia on the one hand, and K\u00falu and the Punjab on the other. Collecting their merchandise from the north, they pass annually into K\u00falu at the end of summer, driving their ponies and donkeys, goats and sheep, laden with pashm or shawl-wool, borax, and cloth; while on their return journey they bring metal vessels, sugar, rice, wheat, tobacco, pepper, ginger, and turmeric.\n\nThe L\u00e1hulis keep only a few sheep and goats, as the snow lies too long and too deep in the winter for the flocks to live out of doors as they do in Lad\u00e1kh. For a very long time, therefore, the upper ends of the main valleys, which are uninhabited, and the grounds high above the villages in the inhabited parts, have been utilized by the shepherds of K\u00e1ngra, Chamba, and K\u00falu. The snow begins to disappear in these places about the beginning of June; the shepherds do not ordinarily enter L\u00e1hul before the end of that month, and they leave it again early in September, by which time the frost is keen, and the rainy season in the outer Him\u00e1layas has come to an end. In the fine dry climate of L\u00e1hul the sheep escape foot-rot and other diseases which constantly attack flocks kept during the rains on the southern slopes of the outer Him\u00e1layas. The sheep arrive wretchedly thin, but by the time they are ready to leave are in splendid condition. A short fine grass of a dull bluish-green colour, called niru, is their favourite food; mat and mor\u00e1r are names of other good kinds of grasses. The goats depend very much on the leaves and twigs of the birch and bush willow.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The valley forms part of K\u00falu tahs\u00edl. The revenue amounts to \u00a3185. The Government established a school at Kielang, where, till recently, Urdu and Tibetan were taught, under the supervision of the Moravian missionaries. It was found necessary to close the school in 1882; but it is expected to be reopened, the principal Th\u00e1kurs being willing to contribute towards its maintenance. A post-office is kept open at Kielang during the summer months. The mean\ntemperature at Kardong is 46\u00b0 F. in March, 59\u00b0 F. in June, and 29\u00b0 F. in September.\n\nL\u00e1ichanpur.\u2014Port on the K\u00e1nsb\u00e1ns river, Balasor District, Bengal. The mouth of the river has now nearly silted up, and is concealed by a dense fringe of jungle. It is not navigable by vessels of more than 45 tons burden. The rice sloops taking in cargoes at this port load while at anchor several miles out to sea, the rice being carried to them in small boats. The sloops come as near the coast as the high tide permits, and when the water recedes they are left resting on a soft and yielding cushion of mud; the vessels are thus secure in case of storms. In 1873\u201374, the value of the imports of L\u00e1ichanpur, and its sister port Churaman, amounted to \u00a3251, and that of the exports to \u00a313,831. In 1881\u201382, the imports were valued at \u00a33062, and the exports at \u00a38710.\n\nL\u00e1ira (Lehira).\u2014Estate or zamind\u00e1ri in Sambalpur tahsil, Sambalpur District, Central Provinces. Lat. 21\u00b0 44' N., long. 84\u00b0 17' E.; 17 miles north-east of Sambalpur town. Area, 46 square miles, nearly the whole of which is cultivated. Chief products\u2014rice, pulses, oil-seeds, and sugar-cane. Iron-ore is found. Number of villages 25, with a total of 1543 houses. Total population (1881) 5932, namely, males 2974, and females 2958. The high road to R\u00e1nchi passes through the western portion of the estate. The estate was originally granted as a j\u00e1gir to the ancestor of the present chief in 1777, by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Sambalpur, as a reward for military services rendered. The j\u00e1gir was afterwards resumed and converted into an ordinary estate held on zamind\u00e1ri tenure. The late zamind\u00e1r, Sibn\u00e1th Singh, was noted as being the only Gond chief who did not join the mutineers in the disturbances of 1857 and 1858. He died a few years ago, and was succeeded by his son Bindraban Singh, who is still (1884) a minor.\n\nL\u00e1it-m\u00e1o-doh.\u2014Mountain range in the Kh\u00e1si Hills, Assam. Highest peak, 5377 feet above sea-level.\n\nL\u00e1-k\u00e1-dong (or Umat).\u2014Village in the south of the Jaintia Hills, Assam; 2200 feet above sea-level. There is a coal-field here, with an estimated area of 0\u00b7394 square mile, and a marketable out-turn of 1,100,000 tons. The mineral is of an excellent quality either for producing gas or coke. From its composition, quick combustion, and irregular cleavage, it is computed to be about 6 per cent. inferior to good English coal. The great difficulty in its profitable working lies in the want of means of communication. L\u00e1-k\u00e1-dong is 6 miles from Borgh\u00e1t, a village on the Thantidu or Hari river, a tributary of the Surm\u00e1, which is navigable all the year round by boats of about 28 maunds burden; but from L\u00e1-k\u00e1-dong to Borgh\u00e1t only coolie-carriage is at present available. The mine is the sole property of Government, which leased the rights of working to a succession of European capitalists from 1848 to 1859.\nDuring that period about 5000 tons of coal were raised for exportation. The mine is no longer worked.\n\n**Lakapadar.**\u2014Petty State in the Thalawar division of Kathiawar, Bombay Presidency, consisting of 1 village, with 1 proprietor. Situated 20 miles south of Amreli, and 9 west-south-west of Kandla. Area, 5 square miles. Population (1881) 413. Estimated revenue (1881), \u00a3300; tribute of \u00a315, 8s. is paid to the Gaekwar of Baroda, and \u00a32, 8s. to the Nawab of Junagarh. Post-office and school.\n\n**Lakhandai.**\u2014Tributary of the Bagmati river, Bengal; a small stream, which rises in Nep\u00e1l, and enters Muzaffarpur District at Itarwa. After being joined by the Sauran and Basiad, it becomes more important; its breadth here is 40 yards, and depth 15 feet. Flows south and joins the Bagmati 7 or 8 miles south of the Darbhanga-Muzaffarpur road, which is carried over it by an iron girder bridge. In the rains, the Lakhandai is navigable as far as Sitamarhi by boats of nearly 20 tons burden; but above this village a rapid current renders navigation dangerous. The Rajapat, Dumra, Belahi, Serpur, and Rajkhand indigo factories draw their water from this stream.\n\n**Lakh\u00e1t.**\u2014Village on the border of Sylhet District, Assam, at the south foot of the Khasi Hills. The market, which is held every fourth day, is frequented by Khasi and Santeng traders, who bring down potatoes, betel-nuts, pan, oranges, and other produce of their hills to exchange for cotton goods, salt, rice, and hardware.\n\n**Lakhi (Laki).**\u2014Mountain range in Sind, Bombay Presidency. Connected with the Hala or Brahui mountains in Baluchistan; the most easterly of a number of hill ranges in the western part of Sind, extending between Baluchistan and the alluvial tract of the Indus, and also between the desert of Shikarpur and Karachi (Kurrachee). Length of range, about 50 miles; greatest elevation, 1500 to 2000 feet. Lat. (centre) 26\u00b0 N., long. 67\u00b0 50' E. The mountains are for the most part of recent formation, containing marine remains in great quantities. Huge fissures, apparently produced by earthquakes, traverse this range; and the frequent occurrence of hot springs and of sulphurous exhalations is a sign of volcanic action. Some parts, again, appear to be of more ancient formation, as they yield lead, antimony, and copper. The whole tract is wild and dreary. Near the town of Sehw\u00e1n, the Lakhi range terminates abruptly on the Indus, in a nearly perpendicular face of rock 600 feet high, which presents an imposing appearance from the river.\n\n**Lakhi (Laki).**\u2014Village and railway station in Sehw\u00e1n Sub-division, Karachi (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; situated close to the west bank of the Indus, and adjacent to the entrance of what is known as the Lakhi Pass, through which runs the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway. The place is picturesquely situated, the Lakhi Moun-\ntains, here of considerable elevation, sloping down to the west of the town, which is on the main road leading from Kotri to Sehw\u00e1n. Branch road to the Dh\u00e1ra Tirth or 'hot springs,' distant about 2 miles. From Sehw\u00e1n this village is distant 12 miles south, and from M\u00e1njhand 32 miles north-west. Post-office, dharms\u00e1la, and police lines. Population in 1881, inconsiderable.\n\n**Lakhi (Laki).**\u2014Town in Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 27\u00b0 51' 30\" N., long. 68\u00b0 44' E.; elevation above sea, 234 feet. Lakhi is 3\u00bd miles distant from the junction station, Ruk, of the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi line, and is situated on the main road between Shik\u00e1rpur and Sukkur (8 miles south of the former), and has road communication also with the villages of M\u00e1ri and Kazi-W\u00e1han. Lakhi is the head-quarters station of a tapad\u00e1r, and contains a travellers' bungalow, school, and cattle pound. Police post of 6 men. Population in 1881, inconsiderable. The town of Lakhi is of ancient date, and was the chief place of that part of Sind known as Burdika and Larkh\u00e1na, at a time when the present site of Shik\u00e1rpur was covered with thick forest. Soon after the founding of Shik\u00e1rpur, Lakhi dwindled away in size and importance.\n\n**Lakhimpur.**\u2014British District occupying the extreme eastern portion of the Province of Assam; situated on both banks of the Brahmaputra, and lying between 26\u00b0 51' and 27\u00b0 54' N. lat., and between 93\u00b0 49' and 96\u00b0 4' E. long. The area within these limits is estimated at about 11,500 square miles, but the greater portion is sparsely occupied by hill tribes, who do not acknowledge the regular authority of the British Government. The settled portion of the District was ascertained by the recent Survey to cover an area of 3723 square miles, with a population, including certain hill tribes in the unsurveyed tracts, of 179,893, according to the Census of 1881. The administrative headquarters are at Dibrugarh, near the confluence of the Dibru river with the Brahmaputra.\n\nThe District, in its wider sense, is bounded on the north by the Daphl\u00e1, M\u00edr\u00ed, Abar, and Mishm\u00ed Hills; east by the Mishm\u00ed and Singpho Hills; south by the watershed of the P\u00e1tkai range and the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills; west by the Districts of Darrang and Sibs\u00e1gar, the former District being separated by the Mar\u00e1marn\u00e1i river, and the latter by the Dihing and Disang rivers. To the north and east the frontier remains undefined and undeclared; on the extreme south, an agreement has been arrived at between the British and Burmese Governments, but a debateable land is occupied by various savage communities who cling to their independence.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Lakhimpur consists of a narrow strip of level country fringing both banks of the Brahmaputra, from which the hills rise abruptly north, south, and east. It is situated at the head of\nthe Assam valley, where the Brahmaputra and its great tributaries burst through the gorges of the Himalayas. The scenery is both varied and picturesque. Along the banks of the river grow gigantic grasses and reeds. Farther inland are seen extensive paddy fields, dotted with villages, which are encircled by groves of bamboo and fruit-trees. In the distance, black, pathless forests stretch away from the lower slopes high up towards the snow-capped mountains. Except in the unsurveyed tracts, there are no hills within the District. In the south-east, however, near Jaipur, there are a few small knolls, rising 200 or 300 feet above the plain.\n\nThe river system is constituted by the Brahmaputra and its numerous tributaries and offshoots. The great river itself flows through the District for a distance of 400 miles. As far as Dibrugarh, it is navigable for steamers and large native boats at all seasons of the year. During the rains, steamers can get up to Sadiya; above that place the current is rapid, but the passage of canoes is possible almost to the Brahmakund. The real source and early channel of the Brahmaputra has not yet been definitely ascertained. The same may be said of its two great tributaries, the Dibang and Dihang, the latter of which breaks through the Himalayas, and both of which join the Brahmaputra in Lakhimpur District. It is now, however, almost certain that the Dihang is identical with the Tsanpu or great river of Tibet, and is the main source of the Brahmaputra. Neither the Dibang nor Dihang is at any season navigable by craft larger than canoes. The other important tributaries of the Brahmaputra are\u2014on the north bank, the Subansiri, which is navigable for some distance by steamers, and itself receives numerous hill streams; on the south bank, the Noa Dihing, the Dibru and Bur\u00ee Dihing, Tingrai-nadi, and Sessa. The Lohit is a large branch of the Brahmaputra, said to have been produced by the floods of the Subansiri; it flows parallel to the main stream for a winding course of about 70 miles.\n\nNo rivers or marshes have been embanked for the purpose of extending cultivation since the British annexation of the country, but some of the embankments constructed by the old Assamese rulers of the Province have been repaired and kept in order. There are large tracts of river and marsh land which could be reclaimed if required, but at present the population is not sufficiently numerous to bring under tillage the lands already cultivable. The wild reeds indigenous to the marshes are utilized for walling the houses. In 1882, the right of fishing in the rivers was leased out by Government for \u00a3463.\n\nIn the settled portion of the District, forests are estimated to cover an area of 2950 square miles; and a considerable area has been brought under the supervision of the Forest Department. Owing to an improvident system of leasing, and for other reasons, the plains have now been nearly stripped of the valuable caoutchouc or india-rubber\ntree. Uncultivated pasture lands of wide extent are to be found all over the District, but their area and extent cannot be estimated, as they have never been defined or separated from the interminable jungle waste which stretches around in every direction. None of the inhabitants gain their livelihood by pasturing cattle in the forests. The principal jungle products are silk, beeswax, and various drugs and dyes, brought to the market by the hill tribes, who combine this pursuit with agriculture.\n\nWild animals of all kinds abound, including elephants, rhinoceros, buffaloes, the mithun or wild cow, bears, and deer. The right of capturing wild elephants is a Government monopoly, and is annually farmed out. From \u00a32000 to \u00a33000 a year used to be realized from this source, in addition to a royalty of \u00a310 on each elephant captured, which increased the sum above mentioned by about one-half. Of late years, very much reduced prices have been received for these elephant farms, the reason being that to make elephant-hunting profitable, a large initial expense is required, which any ordinary lessee cannot afford. There is no lack of elephants, however, in the District, and a Government kheddah might very profitably be established here.\n\nThe mineral wealth of Lakhimpur has not yet been developed. Coal and petroleum are known to exist in many spots near Jaipur and M\u00e1kum, and arrangements have been recently made to open out these localities by means of a railway from Dibrugarh, the head-quarters town. A large demand for coal by the River Steamer Company is anticipated, and also an increased use of coal or coke in the tea factories. In January 1883, prior to the opening up of the M\u00e1kum railway, coal was difficult to procure at 4s. a cwt. in Dibrugarh, but it is thought that the railway company will probably be able to supply it at one-third of this cost. Limestone is found in the bed of the Brahmaputra, near Sadiy\u00e1, and in its tributaries from the Mishm\u00ed Hills, but not in any large masses. Traces of iron exist, and the coal near M\u00e1kum contains sulphur in rather large quantities. Fine clay also occurs in connection with the coal. From time immemorial, gold has been washed in many of the rivers, particularly the Subansiri and its tributaries north of the Brahmaputra. Formerly a class of gold-washers, called Sonw\u00e1ls (from Son, gold), used, it is believed, to make considerable profits from this source; but the great demand for labour caused by the introduction of tea cultivation, and the consequent increase in wages and prices, has almost entirely put a stop to the industry. In 1883, the right of searching for gold in the Subansiri river and its tributaries was let at a nominal rate for a period of ten years to a European planter of the District, Mr. Scott-Campbell; and it is possible that there may be a resuscitation of the industry, although the\nresults of Mr. Campbell's operations are not known. Many salt and mineral springs are found in the low hillocks throughout the District. The most noticeable are the brine springs at Borh\u00e1t, which at one time yielded great quantities of salt, but are now hardly worked at all.\n\nTwo picturesque gorges worthy of notice are situated in Lakhimpur. The Brahmakund or Parasur\u00e1mkund is the gorge through which the smallest and most southerly branch of the Brahmaputra (which alone bears the name of the great river) finds its way to the plains. It is a famous place of pilgrimage, and is annually resorted to by large numbers of Hindu devotees, although the journey to it is both difficult and dangerous. The Deo Dubi or Pool of the Demon is a dark pool of great depth in the gorge through which the Disang river leaves the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills.\n\n**History.**\u2014This tract of country figures largely in the annals of Assam, as the region where successive invaders from the east first reached the Brahmaputra, and as being always inhabited by a turbulent population. The earliest traditions, if trustworthy, indicate that Lakhimpur was in remote times the centre of a flourishing Hindu civilisation, connected with the name of a P\u00e1l dynasty. The first invaders were the B\u00e1ra (or twelve) Bhuiy\u00e1s, who are supposed to have been leaders of a colony, driven from the western Provinces of India by domestic convulsions. To these chiefs is attributed the construction of the large tanks still to be seen in the neighbourhood of B\u00e1nsk\u00e1ta and Lakhimpur town; but they have left no traces in the present population of the country. The B\u00e1ra Bhuiy\u00e1s are said to have been driven out by the Chuti\u00e1s, the first of the races of Shan origin who penetrated into Assam. The Chuti\u00e1 kingdom appears to have centred on the banks of the Subansiri river, and to have been of no long duration. The Chuti\u00e1s were in their turn driven out by the Ahams, whose arrival is placed in the 13th century. The Chuti\u00e1s sustained the struggle for some years, but in the end were completely defeated, many of them being removed to the tract now known as Chuti\u00e1, in the adjoining District of Darrang. The Ahams are also a tribe of Shan descent, whose original home was in the hilly tract of country known as the Kingdom of Pong. Their modern representatives are quiet agriculturists; but at the time of the conquest the Ahams were undoubtedly a fierce and warlike race, with great capacity for administration. They gradually extended their rule down the valley of the Brahmaputra; and on the frontier of Bengal defended themselves successfully against the generals of the Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb. It is also said that the neighbouring hill tribes acknowledged an allegiance to the Aham kings, which some of them now refuse to British authority. The greatest of the dynasty was R\u00e1j\u00e1 Rudra Singh, under whom all Assam was flourishing and peaceful.\n\nThe downfall of Aham rule in Lakhimpur is assigned to the reign of\nGaurin\u00e1th Singh, who was driven out of his capital into Lower Assam, and left this prosperous tract to be devastated by the insurgents. It was at this time that the race known as Mo\u00e1m\u00e1ri\u00e1 or Maran established their independence on the south bank of the Brahmaputra; while the Khamt\u00eds ravaged the north-east corner in the neighbourhood of Sadiy\u00e1. Order had scarcely been restored under the administration of the Bar\u00e1 Gos\u00e1i\u00edn, when the Burmese commenced their series of invasions which finally depopulated the whole country. On one occasion the inhabitants made a desperate stand in the neighbourhood of Lakhimpur town, but they were completely defeated, and the survivors were exposed to most wanton cruelties.\n\nThe misfortunes of Lakhimpur did not cease even with the expulsion of the Burmese in 1825. For several years after the British had nominally annexed the whole Province of Assam, they were unable to spare a single European officer for the civil administration of this remote tract. The southern region, known as Matak, and now included within the Sub-division of Dibrugarh, was allowed to remain under its native chief, whose rule was of a mild and patriarchal character. But on the death of the old chief in 1839, the conditions proposed to his successor were not accepted, and the country was then taken under direct British management. In the same year, it was resolved to dispossess R\u00e1j\u00e1 Purandar Singh, who had been placed over a tract stretching across both banks of the Brahmaputra, which corresponds to the eastern half of the Sub-division of North Lakhimpur and all Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r District. The misrule of the governor, the exactions of his subordinates, and the aggressions of the hill tribes, had reduced this tract to extreme desolation. So late as 1853, it was described as 'a wilderness from which it will take years to recover;' and even at the present day it is the most sparsely populated portion of the Province. The third portion of the District, called Sadiy\u00e1, had also been allowed to continue under a native governor, who was in this case a Khamt\u00ed chief. In 1835, it was found necessary to place the administration under the control of the military officer who had from the first been stationed at Sadiy\u00e1 town. Four years later, the Khamt\u00eds swept down from the hills, destroyed the town, and cut to pieces the detachment of Sepoys, together with Major White, the commandant and Political Agent. Since 1839, when the entire District was resumed by the British, such inroads have been successfully checked. The hill tribes are learning the advantages of peaceful intercourse; agriculture is extending on the plains, and the introduction of the tea plant has opened a new era of prosperity.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Two early estimates of the population of the regularly settled part of the District are in existence, which give elaborate details, and are said to have been arrived at after actual counting. The\nenumeration in 1847-48 showed a total of 81,917 persons, who had increased by 1852-53 to 85,296. The regular Census of 1871-72 returned the population of the settled and revenue-paying tract at 121,267; while that of 1881 showed that the population had risen to 179,893, being considerably more than double the population of 1848, and 48.34 per cent. increase on that of 1872. In 1881, however, the entire District was censused; and a considerable portion of the increase is explained by the fact that in 1881 some 4000 Khamtis and Singphos, who live on the extreme border, were enumerated for the first time, as well as a large number of Ahams and other settlers in the jungle. The results of the Census of 1881 may be briefly summarized as follows:\u2014Area of regularly settled District, 3723 square miles, with 1100 villages, and 29,255 occupied houses. Total population, 179,893, namely, males 96,335, and females 83,558; proportion of males, 53.6 per cent. Average density of population, 48.32 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, .29; houses, 7.87 per square mile; inmates per house, 6.5. Classified according to age, the Census Report returned the population as follows:\u2014Under 15 years of age, males 38,370, and females 34,090; total children, 72,460, or 40.2 per cent. of the population: 15 years of age and upwards, males 57,965, and females 49,468; total adults, 107,433, or 59.8 per cent.\n\nIn religion, the population consists of\u2014Hindus, 152,190, or 84.5 per cent.; Muhammadans, 5824; Buddhists, 4657; Christians, 837; Jains, 3; and hill tribes still professing aboriginal religions, 16,382.\n\nAs might be anticipated from the history and geographical position of Lakhimpur, the proportion of Hindus proper, and especially of high-caste Hindus, is lower than in any other District of Assam. The Br\u00e1hmans number 1363, the R\u00e1jputs 1791, the K\u00e1yasths 2070, and the Agarwalas, the trading castes from the north-west, 396. By far the most numerous caste is the Kalit\u00e1 (7742), the former priests of the aboriginal kings of Assam; they have now taken to agriculture, and rank as pure S\u00fadras. Other Hindu castes, based upon race rather than religion, are returned at 52,395.\n\nThe tribes ranked in the Census Report as semi-Hinduized aborigines constitute more than half the total population. The most numerous tribe is the Aham, the former rulers of the country, who still number 51,588, or almost the same number as the Hindus proper. Next come the kindred Chuti\u00e1s (16,708); the Doms, a tribe of peculiar exclusiveness in Assam (11,765); and the Kochs (4598).\n\nThe pure aborigines consist of three classes\u2014representative communities of the neighbouring hill tribes; immigrants of old standing, such as the Cachar\u00eds; and labourers on the tea plantations recently imported from the western Districts of Bengal and from Behar. The neighbouring hill tribes may again be sub-divided into two broadly\ndistinguished races\u2014(1) those of Shan descent, who have forced their way across the hills from the south, represented by the Khamt\u00eds and Singphos, who are Buddhists; (2) a group of Indo-Chinese origin, comprising the Mishm\u00eds, Abars, M\u00edr\u00eds, Daphl\u00e1s, and Ak\u00e1s, who occupy the slopes and spurs of the Him\u00e1layas along the north of the District. The great bulk of these tribes live in mountain fastnesses, far beyond the British frontier; but all of them have sent out little colonies, who settle down peaceably on the borders of the plains, and learn the arts of agriculture and commerce. The aboriginal tribes in Lakhimpur, Hindus and non-Hindus, are represented as follows:\u2014Abars, 821; Ahams, 51,588; Chuti\u00e1s, 16,708; Daphl\u00e1s, 210; Cachar\u00eds, 18,699; Khamt\u00eds, 2883; Kochs, 4598; Lalungs, 730; Manipur\u00eds, 99; Matak\u00eds, 220; Mikirs, 2752; Mishm\u00eds, 681; M\u00edr\u00eds, 11,687; Nagas, 230; Nep\u00e1l\u00eds, 879; Rabhas, 390; Sant\u00e1ls, 1035; and Singphos, 1774. It is reported that large numbers of the hill tribes are annually converted from their indigenous forms of demon-worship to Hinduism.\n\nThe faith of Isl\u00e1m now makes no progress. The comparatively large number of Musalm\u00e1ns in this remote corner, into which the Mughal armies never penetrated, is attributed partly to the fact that the Aham kings used to import Muhammadan artificers for their public works, and partly to a later immigration of shopkeepers from Dacca. The Far\u00e1\u00edz\u00ed or reforming spirit is said to have made some progress among them. Of the 837 Christians, 227 are Europeans or Eurasians, and 610 natives. The majority of the native Christians consist of tea labourers imported from Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. The Matak tribe represents the Mo\u00e1m\u00e1ri\u00e1s or Marans, who inhabit the south-eastern portion of the District. They became converts to the Vishnuite form of Hinduism at an early period; and their persecution by the Durg\u00e1-worshipping kings of Assam led to many outbreaks, and ultimately to the assertion of their independence.\n\nTowns and Villages.\u2014The most populous place in Lakhimp\u00far District, and the only place with a population exceeding 5000, is the civil station of Dibrugarh, situated on the Dibru river, a few miles above its junction with the Brahmaputra. It contains (1881) 1660 houses and 7153 inhabitants, including 1736 in the cantonments. Other places of some importance as centres of river traffic are\u2014Lakhimp\u00far, the head-quarters of the Sub-division of the same name; and Sadiya, which is occupied as a frontier station by a detachment of Native infantry. An annual fair is held at Sadiy\u00e1 in the month of February, on which occasion Government presents are distributed among the frontier tribes. No tendency is perceptible on the part of the population to gather into towns or centres of commerce or industry; except at the head-quarters town of Dibrugarh, where the population has considerably increased of late years. Of the 1100 villages returned\nby the Census, no less than 941 had less than two hundred inhabitants; 152 from two to five hundred; 5 from five hundred to a thousand; and 2 upwards of a thousand inhabitants.\n\nMaterial Condition of the People.\u2014The peasantry, as a rule, are well off. Their wants are, comparatively speaking, few, and easily supplied by their own industry. With the exception of such articles as salt or opium, all their actual necessaries are supplied from their own agricultural produce. Money is very little used by the Assamese peasant, and only passes through his hands in small quantities for the purchase of a little salt, betel-nut, and opium; with now and then a cooking utensil, a cotton cloth for a garment, or an ornament for his wife. He has, further, to pay his rent in money. He cultivates his land himself, with the assistance of his family, for the purpose of producing the different articles of food required, and subsists almost entirely upon the products of his own little plot. His meal of rice is supplemented by some herbs gathered in the fields and ponds, or else raised in his own garden; and also by very small fishes caught in the small streams, marshes, ponds, and even in the ditches. Many varieties of edible roots, vegetables, and fruits grow wild, and only require to be looked for. To clothe himself and his family he rears silkworms; either the eri\u00e1 worm, which feeds on the leaves of the castor-oil plant growing in his little patch of garden land, and which is reared in the house; or the mug\u00e1 worm, which feeds on the leaves of the s\u00fam tree, and is partially reared out of doors. His wife weaves the cloth and makes it up. Even oil need not be bought, as he can grow mustard seed in his own garden, and extract the oil by means of a rude press. To pay the rent of his land, he sells a small portion of his rice and silk. The rate of the land-tax is very light, being less than the value of two hundredweights of uncleaned rice per acre, or from 3s. to 3s. 9d. per acre, according to the locality and the description of the land.\n\nUnder such circumstances it would naturally be supposed that the Assamese peasant was prosperous. But, unfortunately, owing to his inveterate indolence and addiction to the use of opium, his condition is not so good as it is sometimes supposed to be, and he is very often in arrears with his rent, even when he has means to pay.\n\nThe people are extremely averse to working for daily wages, as they affirm that by so doing they compromise their respectability. The indigenous population furnishes very few permanent labourers to the tea-gardens. These consist principally of Sant\u00e1ls from Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, low castes from the upper Districts of Bengal and from the North-Western Provinces, together with some local labourers from Lower Assam. The trading community consists chiefly of M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris from the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na States; the shopkeepers are mostly Musalm\u00e1ns from Dacca.\nand Sylhet. With regard to occupation, the Census of 1881 divided the male population into the following six classes:\u2014(1) Professional classes, including all civil and military officials and the learned professions, 1621; (2) domestic class, 1072; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 1162; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 58,396; (5) manufacturing and industrial class, 1617; (6) indefinite and non-productive class (comprising 246 general labourers and 32,311 male children and unspecified), 34,267.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014As throughout the rest of Assam, rice forms the one staple crop, the only other cereal cultivated being Indian corn in small quantities. Rice is sub-divided into two usual crops\u2014the s\u00e1li, sown in low lands about July, transplanted in the following month, and reaped in December; the \u00e1hu or \u00e1us, sown in high lands about March, not generally transplanted, and reaped in October. The green crops grown in the District consist of many varieties of pulses, and mustard grown as an oil-seed. The miscellaneous crops comprise several sorts of fibres and of sugar-cane, mulberry, long pepper, potatoes, and pumpkins. Among fruit-trees, are the orange, lime, lemon, citron, and plantain.\n\nIn 1871 it was estimated that 61,490 acres were actually under cultivation in Lakhimpur District, or only one hundred and fiftieth part of the total area. The several crops were thus apportioned:\u2014Rice, 39,460 acres; tea, 15,000; pulses, 2130; vegetable and potatoes, 1000 each; cotton, 850; oil-seeds, 750; sugar-cane, 300; other crops, 1000 acres. About 2300 acres bore a second crop of vegetables, oil-seeds, or pulses. By 1883-84 the cultivated area had increased to 126,021 acres, or, deducting 1460 acres cropped more than once, to 124,561 acres. The area under the different crops was returned as follows:\u2014Rice, 70,928 acres; other food-grains, 8101 acres; oil-seeds, 1384 acres; sugar-cane, 884 acres; cotton, 1050 acres; jute, 200 acres; tea, 36,873 acres; miscellaneous crops, 6601 acres. Manure is not generally used, except for sugar-cane, and then in the form of the sweepings of cattle-sheds. It is stated, however, that the dead fish left on the lowlands after the subsidence of the annual inundations, serve as a natural fertilizer. Irrigation from neighbouring tanks or pools is sometimes resorted to in the case of the rice crop.\n\nThe entire soil is the property of Government. Leases are granted to the individual cultivators at the following rates, which are common to all Assam:\u2014For basti or homestead lands, 6s. an acre; for rupit or low-lying lands, on which rice is grown, 3s. 9d. an acre; for faringh\u00e1ti or dry lands, suited for vegetables, etc., 3s. an acre. In early times the revenue used to be collected by means of a poll-tax, varying in amount from 1s. to 2s. a head; an assessment on the land\nwas first introduced in 1841. Certain classes, such as the M\u00edris occupying the sub-hill tracts, and the Mataks, still pay a poll-tax, the rate being 6s. a head. The average out-turn from an acre of rupit land is estimated at about 26 cwts. of unhulled rice of the s\u00e1li crop; from an acre of faringh\u00e1ti land, about 12 cwts. of \u00e1us unhulled rice. From both lands a second crop is sometimes raised, which may amount to 13 cwts. of either pulses or fibres, or half that weight of cotton.\n\nA farm of about ten acres in extent is considered a large holding for a peasant; one of five acres as a comfortable medium-sized one; while one of two acres is reckoned as very small, and as a rule is only held by a man who has some auxiliary means of subsistence. A cultivator with a five-acre holding is considered to be as well off as a respectable retail shopkeeper, and in better circumstances than a man earning 16s. a month in money wages. The peasantry, on the whole, are free from debt.\n\nWithin the past twenty years, since tea cultivation has been conducted on an extensive scale, rates of wages have more than doubled; ordinary labour, in fact, is almost unobtainable. The construction of the Assam railway to Mak\u00fam has temporarily had the effect of enhancing the rates still further. Day-labourers now receive from 6d. to 1s. a day; bricklayers, from 1s. to 1s. 6d.; and smiths and carpenters, from 2s. to 4s. The price of food-grains has risen in an equal proportion. Best rice now sells at about 14s. per cwt.; common rice, at about 7s. 6d.; and common unhulled rice, at 5s. Prices were not affected by the famine of 1866.\n\nLakhimpur District is not specially liable to the calamities of flood or drought. The harvest is not known to have failed generally within the memory of the present generation. In the event of a deficient rainfall, the augmented produce of the low-lying lands and the marshes would probably compensate for the failure of the crops on the higher levels. A few embankments are in existence as a protection against excessive inundations, but they have been suffered to fall into a bad state of repair. If the price of common unhulled rice were to rise to 5s. 5d. per cwt. in the rural markets in the month of January, that should be regarded as a sign of approaching failure of the local harvest, but not of distress, as wages are very high and the country is easy of access for supplies from without.\n\nManufactures, etc. \u2014 Local manufactures consist chiefly of mats, basket-work, and silk cloth, which are made up by the people themselves, each family providing for its own wants. There are a few potters and braziers; but the pottery manufactured is of the poorest description, and the importation of cheap brass utensils from Bengal has destroyed the native manufacture, which was of well amalgamated metal and of a handsome shape. The silk cloth, known as mug\u00e1, is\nmade from the cocoons of the mug\u00e1 worm (Saturnia assamungis), which feeds on the leaves of the sim tree. This moth is found wild in the jungle; but domesticated worms imported from Nowgong or K\u00e1mr\u00fap are alone used for silk. While feeding on the sim trees, constant care has to be taken to protect the worms from their enemies of the bird and insect world. A thousand cocoons will produce from 6 to 8 ounces of silk thread, which is worth from 10s. to 11s. per pound. A silk waist-cloth (dhuti), 18 feet long by 3 feet wide, sells for from \u00a31, 4s. to \u00a32, according to quality. Very little silk is exported, and the manufacture has greatly fallen off since the prosperous days of the Aham kings. Singphos, Khamt\u00eds, and other hill tribes wear tartans of various kinds, both in silk and cotton. Some of their dyes are indigenous, but they now largely employ thread coloured with aniline dyes, which they procure from M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri merchants.\n\nTea.\u2014The cultivation and manufacture of tea is conducted by European capital and under European supervision. Lakhimpur District was the scene of the first attempts at tea cultivation by the Government about the year 1835, and the Assam Company commenced operations here in 1840. After having passed through periods of depression, arising from reckless speculation and want of experience, the industry has now reached a stable position, and has made great strides in recent years. In 1874 there were 112 gardens under plant, covering an area of 89,370 acres, of which 11,680 acres were actually in bearing. The total out-turn was 1,811,920 lbs., showing an increase of 320,725 lbs. on the previous year. The number of European superintendents employed was 42, with 176 native assistants; the total number of labourers was 10,612, of whom 7936 had been imported under contract from Bengal. At the end of 1881, 202 gardens were in existence, with a total area of 92,982 acres of land taken up for tea, of which 18,876 acres were under mature, and 6386 acres under immature plant. The total out-turn of tea was 5,735,955 lbs. The Census Report returned the population on the tea-gardens at 37,295, of whom 8961 were natives of Assam, 28,463 were natives from other Indian Provinces, and 141 natives of countries outside India, presumably Europeans.\n\nHopes have been entertained that the mineral wealth of Lakhimpur would also attract European capital. In 1866, operations were commenced in the coal-field near Jaipur, where the coal is of excellent quality, and can be quarried without mining. About 6700 tons in all were raised; but it was found that the mineral could not be brought to market at a sufficiently low rate to enable it to compete with imports from Bengal. At the same time, a scheme for working the petroleum wells in the neighbourhood of the coal-field was taken up with much energy, but it was unfortunately broken off, owing to the death of its promoter. In 1882, however, the Assam Railway and Trading Com-\npany, having obtained concessions from Government, commenced laying a line of railway on the metre gauge from Dibrugarh to Sadiy\u00e1, with a branch line to Mak\u00fam, of which 70 miles were opened up to the end of March 1884. Two coal mines in the Mak\u00fam field have been opened; and it is hoped that these mines, which appear exceedingly rich, will in time supply not only all Assam, but even Calcutta with coal and coke of excellent quality. It is also proposed to reopen the petroleum springs near Mak\u00fam, the concession of working which has been granted to the Assam Railway and Trading Company for a term of years.\n\nThe rivers constitute the principal means of communication in Lakhimpur. In addition, there were, in 1882, 332 miles of District roads, maintained at a cost of \u00a31600, besides 93 miles of Imperial roads. As above stated, the Assam Railway had 70 miles open for traffic up to March 1884.\n\nThe commerce of the District is entirely conducted by river; and is mainly in the hands of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r\u00eds from the north-west, and Musalm\u00e1ns from Dacca. The chief centres of trade are Dibrugarh, Lakhimpur town, Jaipur, and Sadiy\u00e1. The exports consist of tea, mug\u00e1 silk thread, india-rubber, beeswax, ivory, and mustard seed; in return for which the following articles are imported\u2014rice, opium, tobacco, salt, oil, iron, and cotton cloth. It is thought that the value of the exports, including tea, largely exceeds the value of the imports; but no trustworthy statistics are available. An annual fair has for some years been established by Government at the frontier station of Sadiy\u00e1, but the importance of this gathering is rather political than commercial.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1870\u201371, the net revenue of Lakhimpur District amounted to \u00a348,430, towards which the land-tax contributed \u00a314,300, or 30 per cent.; the net expenditure was \u00a324,856, or about half the revenue. In 1881\u201382, the District revenue had increased to \u00a380,329, of which \u00a324,463 was derived from the land. The total District expenditure was \u00a326,463, or nearly one-third of the revenue. The land revenue has increased from \u00a33578 in 1850, to \u00a315,646 in 1875, and \u00a324,463 in 1881\u201382. In 1880\u201381 there were 3 covenanted officials stationed in the District, and 9 magisterial, 3 civil, and 6 revenue courts open. For police purposes, Lakhimpur is divided into 6 police circles, with 9 outpost stations. In 1881\u201382, the civil and frontier police consisted of a force of 344 officers and men. These figures show 1 policeman to every 9\u00b76 square miles or to every 526 of the population, and an average cost of \u00a32, 8s. per square mile, or 10d. per head of population. There is no municipal police in Lakhimpur, and the chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs or village watch of Bengal are not found anywhere in Assam proper. In 1881\u201382, the total number of persons in Lakhimpur District convicted of any offence, great or small, was 974, being 1\nperson in every 184 of the population. By far the greater proportion of the convictions were for petty offences. The District contains 1 jail and 1 sub-divisional lock-up. In 1881, the average daily number of prisoners was 51, of whom 3 were females; the labouring convicts averaged 50. These figures show 1 prisoner in jail to every 3863 of the population. The total cost amounted to \u00a3714, or \u00a314 per prisoner; the jail manufactures yielded a net profit of \u00a3257.\n\nEducation had not made much progress in Lakhimpur till Sir G. Campbell's reforms, by which the benefit of the grant-in-aid rules was extended to the p\u0101ths\u0101l\u0101s or village schools. In 1856 there were only 7 inspected schools in the whole District, attended by 286 pupils. By 1870, apparently owing to some change in system, these numbers had fallen to 3 schools and 216 pupils; but in 1873, after the above-mentioned reforms had come into operation, the schools increased to 24, and the pupils to 699. In 1881\u201382, the number of schools had further risen to 67, with an attendance of 2314 pupils; or 1 school to every 55 square miles, and 12 pupils to every thousand of the population. The chief institution is the Government Higher School at Dibrugarh, which had an average attendance of 220 pupils in 1882.\n\nThe District is divided into 2 administrative Sub-divisions, and into 6 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles. The Sub-division of North Lakhimpur, which covers the whole tract north of the Brahmaputra, and contained in 1881, 53,750 inhabitants, scattered over an estimated area of between 7500 and 8000 square miles, is considered for certain purposes to form an independent District by itself. The entire District is divided into 63 mauz\u00e1s (circles of villages for land revenue purposes), and 82 p\u00e1ik mahals (poll-tax paying circles). Dibrugarh town is the only municipality in the District. Municipal income (1883\u201384), \u00a3366, or 1s. 4\u00bdd. per head of municipal population.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Lakhimpur is of an exceptional character. There are only two clearly defined seasons in the year; the hot and rainy season, which lasts for four months, from the middle of June to the middle of October; and the cold and dry season, which occupies the remainder of the twelve months. The months of April and May are described as particularly cool and pleasant. The mean annual temperature is about 65\u00b0 F., and the average rainfall is about 115 inches in the year. In 1883, the rainfall at Dibrugarh was 104.26 inches.\n\nThe endemic diseases are malarious fevers and their sequel\u00e6, various kinds of cutaneous disorders, rheumatic affections, bronchocele, and suppurative inflammation of the lymphatic glands. It has been observed that phthisis, which is prevalent among some of the hill tribes on the north of the Brahmaputra, attacks Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed settlers, but spares the native Hindus and Europeans. Cholera, also, which has repeatedly ravaged the District in recent years, seems to pass over Europeans. In\n1861, more than 15 per cent. of the total population were estimated to have been attacked by cholera, and about 10 per cent. to have died. Increased cultivation, and the clearance of jungle through the enterprise of tea planters, have favourably influenced the general health of the District; and conservancy arrangements now receive careful attention in the town of Dibrugarh. Cattle diseases of a very fatal character have made their appearance in the District several times in recent years, having been apparently imported from Bengal.\n\n[For further information regarding Lakhimpur, see the Statistical Account of Assam, by W. W. Hunter, vol. i. pp. 291-420 (London, Tr\u00fcbner & Co., 1879); A Descriptive Account of Assam, by W. Robinson (1841); Report on the Province of Assam, by A. J. Moffat Mills (Calcutta, 1854); the Assam Census Report for 1881; and the several Provincial Administration and Departmental Reports from 1880 to 1884.]\n\nLakhimpur (or North Lakhimpur).\u2014Sub-division in the north of Lakhimpur District, Assam, lying between 27\u00b0 and 28\u00b0 N. lat., and between 94\u00b0 and 95\u00b0 E. long. The administrative head-quarters are at the village of LAKHIMPUR. The Sub-division is bounded north by the Daphla and Mir\u00ed Hills, and south by the Brahmaputra. Estimated area, about 7750 square miles; number of villages, 403; occupied houses, 9409. Total population (1881) 53,750, namely, Hindus, 43,137; Muhammadans, 1795; and 'others,' 8818. North Lakhimpur is watered by the Subansiri and its tributaries, in most of which gold is found by washing. In former times caoutchouc was abundant in the jungles, but now it can only be collected beyond the frontier. The most valuable wild products are a scarlet root called asu, used for dyeing, and the bark of a tree called uadal, which yields a fibre equal in strength to flax. Apart from the cultivation of rice, the only indigenous industry is the weaving of silk from the mug\u00e1 and eri\u00e1 worms. The mug\u00e1 worm feeds in the open on the leaves of the sam tree (Artocarpus Chaplasha); the eri\u00e1 worm requires to be carefully reared in-doors on the leaves of the castor-oil plant (Ricinus communis). It is calculated that about 328 cwts. of silk cloth are annually produced in North Lakhimpur, valued at \u00a33036.\n\nTea cultivation and manufacture are largely conducted with European capital and under European supervision. The chief difficulty of the planters lies in the scarcity of labour. The country is very sparsely populated, and the natives are too well off and independent to care to work regularly on the gardens. In 1871, the value of the exports from the Sub-division was estimated at \u00a322,000, chiefly tea, caoutchouc, silk cloth, and rice; the imports were valued at \u00a316,000, chiefly oil, salt, and cotton cloth. The inhabitants principally belong to aboriginal and semi-Hinduized tribes \u2014 Ahams, Doms,\nChuti\u00e1s, Kochs, Kalit\u00e1s, Cachar\u00eds, Sar\u00e1niy\u00e1s, and M\u00edris. In 1884 the Sub-division contained 1 civil and 2 criminal courts, with a police force of 83 men.\n\n**Lakhimpur** (or *North Lakhimpur*).\u2014Village in the north of Lakhimpur District, Assam; on the Gari\u00e1j\u00e1n river, a tributary of the Subansiri. Lat. $27\u00b0\\ 14'5\"$ N., long. $94\u00b0\\ 7'10\"$ E. The head-quarters of North Lakhimpur Sub-division and a centre of local trade. Population (1872) 577; (1881) 899, namely, Hindus, 560; Muhammadans, 314; 'others,' 25. The place is the residence of an Assistant Commissioner, who is the sub-divisional officer, and an extra-Assistant Commissioner. A small military and frontier police force is also stationed here, occupying a strong masonry fort. The Gari\u00e1j\u00e1n is only navigable during the rainy season. The public buildings include a lock-up and a charitable dispensary.\n\n**Lakhimpur.**\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of Kheri District, Oudh, lying between $27\u00b0\\ 47'15\"$ and $28\u00b0\\ 29'30\"$ N. lat., and between $80\u00b0\\ 20'$ and $81\u00b0\\ 4'$ E. long. Bounded on the north and east by Dhaurahra tahsil; south by Sit\u00e1pur District; and west by Muhamdi tahsil, and Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur District in the North-Western Provinces. The tahsil comprises the 5 pargan\u00e1s of KHERI, SRINAGAR, BHUR, PAILA, and KUKRA MAILANI. Area, 1078 square miles, of which 463 are under cultivation. Population (1869) 298,338; (1881) 330,707, namely, males 175,987, and females 154,720. Hindus numbered 285,161 in 1881; Muhammadans, 45,468; 'others,' 78. Of the 666 villages comprising the tahsil in 1881, 424 contained less than five hundred inhabitants each. Land revenue, \u00a334,749. In 1884, the Sub-division contained 2 civil and 6 criminal courts, with two police circles (th\u00e1nd\u00e1s), and a police force of 244 men, besides a village police of 818 chaukid\u00e1rs.\n\n**Lakhimpur.**\u2014Chief town of Kheri District, Oudh, and headquarters of Lakhimpur Sub-division; picturesquely situated about a mile south of the Ul river.

Narayanganj, the port of Dacca District, is situated on this river. The Lakhmi\u00e1, with its high and well-wooded banks, is one of the most beautiful rivers in Eastern Bengal; it is also remarkable for the purity and coolness of its waters. For five months of the year, it is a tidal stream; but it is only fordable at Ekd\u00e1la. Owing to the silting up of the Brahmaputra, the waters of the Lakhmi\u00e1 are gradually decreasing.\n\n**Lakhna.**\u2014Town in Bharthna tahsil, Etawah District, North-Western Provinces.

The town contains a fine specimen of an old native fort. Village school, branch post-office. This and five neighbouring villages belong to a colony of T\u00farkom\u00e1ns, in the last stages of poverty. During the last century, however, it possessed considerable strength. In 1794, Bapu Sindhia, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 governor of Sah\u00e1ranpur, was long engaged in reducing it; and the commandant did not surrender until reinforcements arrived under George Thomas, and a practicable breach was effected.\n\nLakhtar (Th\u00e1n Lakhtar).\u2014Native State in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Province of Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency, situated between 22\u00b0 49' and 23\u00b0 N. lat., and between 71\u00b0 46' and 72\u00b0 3' E. long. The estate consists of two distinct portions, Th\u00e1n and Lakhtar, together with some outlying villages within Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District. Population (1881) 23,155; number of villages, 41; area, 247 square miles. There are some rocky tracts in the State, but neither rivers nor hills of any size. The climate is hot and dry, but healthy, the only endemic disease being fever. Cotton and the usual grains are cultivated. Dhers and Musalm\u00e1ns of the Borah class weave coarse cloth, and the potters of Th\u00e1n have a name throughout K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r for the excellence of their work. Lakhtar is one of the 'third-class' K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r States, and the ruler entered into the usual engagements in 1807. The present (1884) chief is Th\u00e1kur Karan Singhj\u00ed, a Hindu of the Jh\u00e1la R\u00e1jput caste. He administers his State in person. Estimated gross revenue,\n\u00a37500; tribute of \u00a3735, 2s. is paid jointly to the British Government and to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.

This tahsil is generally named Marwat by the people, owing to the majority of the inhabitants belonging to that clan; but it is called Laki in official reports after the head-quarters town. The greater part of the area consists of sand or sandy loam, sloping down to the Gambila river from the hills on its southern boundary. There is no irrigation in this tract, except from small hill torrents after rain. In the less sandy parts, it is usual to leave waste the higher portions of the lands of each village, often more than half its area, and to lead the rain-water falling thereon to the lower tracts by drainage channels and embankments. Most villages have small tanks for drinking purposes, at which they also water their cattle; but these tanks are often dry for months together, necessitating water being brought from the Gambila, or some pool in the hills often 10 to 15 miles distant. This work is done by the women with donkeys and bullocks.\n\nArea, 1269 square miles, with 140 towns and villages, 12,801 occupied houses, and 14,504 families. Total population (1881) 75,581, namely, males 40,045, and females 35,536; proportion of males, 53 per cent.

Of the 140 towns and villages, 119 contain less than five hundred inhabitants. The average annual area under cultivation for the five years 1877-81 was 177,793 acres, the chief crops being\u2014Wheat, 92,341 acres; gram, 47,869 acres; b\u00e1jra, 24,539 acres; barley, 7379 acres; jo\u00e1r, 1766 acres; moth, 1409 acres; Indian corn, 1547 acres. Total revenue, \u00a310,906. The administrative staff consists of a tahsild\u00e1r and muns\u00edf, presiding over 1 criminal and 2 civil courts. Number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 3; strength of regular police, 91 men, besides 120 village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs).\nLaki.\u2014Town and municipality in Bannu District, Punjab, and head-quarters of Laki or Marwat tahsil. Lat. $32^\\circ 36' 45''$ N., long. $70^\\circ 57'$ E. Situated on the right bank of the Gambila, 32 miles from Edwardes\u00e1b\u00e1d. The original town, by name Ihsanpur, on the opposite bank of the river, sprang up around a small fort which was built in 1844 by Fateh Kh\u00e1n Tew\u00e1na, a revenue collector for the Sikh Government. It continued to be the capital of Marwat until 1864, when, owing to a flood in the Gambila, and the plague of mosquitoes inseparable from its situation near the marshy apex of the Kuram and Gambila Doab, the District officer had the public buildings removed to the sands on the higher right bank of the Gambila. Here were three villages, M\u00ednakhel, Khoed\u00e1dkhel, and Sayyidkhel. The people of Ihsanpur settled in them, and helped to mould the three villages into the one town of Laki. Population (1881) 4068, namely, Muhammadans, 2906; Hindus, 1146; and Sikhs, 16. Number of occupied houses, 727. Laki is now a thriving little town, with a good b\u00e1z\u00e1r, tahsili, police station, charitable dispensary, d\u00e1k bungalow, sar\u00e1i, school-house, post-office. Considerable trade in grain and other country produce; large exports of food-stuffs down the Indus to Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n, and Sukkur (Sakhar).

It is a perennial stream, and much used for irrigation in Mysore, being crossed by 7 dams, which give water to channels 126 miles in length, yielding a revenue of \u00a33381. The Hanagod dam alone takes off 335 cubic feet of water per second, and irrigates 13,400 acres. The Lakshmantirtha in its descent over an almost perpendicular wall of the Brahmagiri Hills forms a celebrated cataract, which is invested with sin-cleansing virtue, and is visited in February by thousands of devotees. The way to the bathing-place is romantic, with steep hills to the right, and the winding stream to the left. \u2018Every few steps a beggar is encountered, exhibiting his deformities or sores. Here lies a fanatic, as if dead, with a wooden nail through his cheeks; there a boy with a lancet through his outstretched tongue, and a smoking chatti on his stomach; here another man with a long knife across his throat, and a horrible corpse-like appearance.\u2019\nLakshmeswar.\u2014Town in Mir\u00e1j State, South Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Agency, Bombay Presidency.

Its general appearance is that of an undulating plain, bounded on the south by the Vindhyan range, and sloping gradually northwards, till it descends by a series of low, thickly-wooded ridges into the valleys of the Betw\u00e1 and the Jamun\u00ed, whose streams unite to form its northern limit. In the two hilly tracts to the north and south, the soil consists of a poor red gravel, the detritus of the underlying rocks; but on the central table-land, and in isolated valleys elsewhere, there are wide patches of black alluvial soil, known here as mot\u00ed, but elsewhere as m\u00e1r. The plain has a general elevation of about 1500 feet above the level of the sea, and is broken by numerous detached hills and peaks, most of which are mere bosses of crystalline rock, overgrown with thick jungle. To the north, these hills run together, forming low wooded ranges, which finally dip into the deep valley of the Betw\u00e1.\n\nThe whole District is traversed or surrounded by considerable rivers, which take their rise in the Vindhyan chain and flow in a general northerly direction to join the main channel of the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1). The principal of these rivers are the Betw\u00e1, which marks the western and north-western boundary; the Dhas\u00e1n on the south-eastern boundary; and the Jamn\u00ed, which after intersecting the Mahroni tahsil forms the eastern and north-eastern boundary, till it unites with the Betw\u00e1 at the northern apex of the District. These rivers, however, are of no practical value either for purposes of navigation or irrigation. L\u00e1l\u00edtpur is also minutely intersected by a network of smaller streams, which drain off the surface water through converging\nravines with excessive rapidity, and so contribute to impoverish the soil; while, in times of heavy rain, they pour their swollen torrents too suddenly into the larger channels, and carry away before them roads, banks, and bridges, causing a stoppage of communication, and frequently endangering human life.\n\nSeveral artificial lakes and tanks have been constructed in past times, the largest being T\u00e1lbeh\u00e1t, among the northern hills, which forms a fine sheet of water covering an area of upwards of 453 acres. Similar old tanks exist at Dhaur\u00ed S\u00e1g\u00e1r, Dudh\u00ed, Bar, and other places. During the famine of 1868\u201369, the excavation of tanks and the construction of embankments were undertaken as relief works in several villages. Owing to the nature of the soil, however, the area susceptible of profitable irrigation is small, and the cultivators are unwilling to pay a sufficiently high water-rate to yield a moderate return for the heavy outlay.\n\nThere is little cultivation in the District, and that of a poor class, although with the recent increase of population a considerable improvement is observable in this respect. A very large proportion (174,740 acres) of the assessed area is covered with forest jungle. Of these, 90,694 acres were demarcated as Government forest at the time of the land settlement, while 10,900 acres of waste land, in which no proprietary rights existed, have been marked off and reserved. Nomadic (dahya) cultivation so destructive to forests is prohibited, and all villages within the demarcated tracts have been removed elsewhere. Besides timber trees, there is an abundant growth of bamboos. Grass, however, forms the most important jungle product. Large herds of cattle are sent every year to graze in the jungles of the Vindhya hills, and in ordinary years the supply of grass exceeds the demand. In years of drought (as in 1868\u201369), when the grass fails in the plains, these high grass lands prove of inestimable value, and cattle are sent in large numbers from considerable distances to graze in the B\u00e1labah\u00e1t and Lakhanjir jungles. The other forest products are mah\u00fa\u00e1 and chironji fruit, lac, honey, wax, gums, and various esculent roots, the names of which are unknown, but which form part of the food of the jungle tribe of Sahariy\u00e1s.\n\nTigers, leopards, bears, hy\u00e6nas, wolves, wild dogs, wild pigs, sambh\u00e1r, chit\u00e1l deer, antelope, chausingha, and ravine deer are all found in the District. One of the great obstacles to the extension and improvement of cultivation is the extensive damage done to the crops by wild animals, especially by wild pigs, which are so abundant that, without strong thorny hedges around every field, it is almost useless to attempt cultivation at any distance from the village site. During the year 1883, the number of registered deaths caused by wild beasts or snake-bite was 89. The fish most commonly found in the\nrivers of the District are the rohu, m\u00e1hsir, chilwa, b\u00e1m, tengra, parh\u00e1n, gauriya, sauri, and mirgal.\n\nHistory.\u2014The earliest inhabitants of L\u00e1litpur whom tradition commemorates were the aboriginal tribe of Gonds, traces of whom still exist in the temples which crown the peaks of the Vindhyan range; while a remnant of the people themselves is to be found in a few scattered villages upon its slopes. After the Aryan immigration, they appear to have adopted a form of the Hindu religion; and the high civilization which they once attained is attested both by their architectural works and their splendid irrigation reservoirs. They were succeeded by the Chandel princes of M\u00e1hoba, whose history has been briefly related in connection with the Districts of BANDA and HAMIRPUR. After the fall of the Chandels in the end of the 12th century, the country became subject to several petty princes, independent of the Muhammadans at Delhi, till the irruption of the Bundelas in the 14th century. Those warlike southern adventurers established themselves first in the District of JHANSI, and gradually spread their authority over the whole region which still bears their name.\n\nThe modern District of L\u00e1litpur formed part of the Bundela State of Ch\u00e1nderi, whose R\u00e1j\u00e1s were descendants of the great chieftain Rudra Prat\u00e1p. Nine princes of his line reigned in Chanderi from 1602 to 1788, with little interference from the Delhi court, until, in the time of R\u00e1m Chand the ninth, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, whose interposition in the affairs of Bundelkhand has been narrated in the article on B\u00c1nda, first gained a footing in the principality during the absence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 on a pilgrimage to Ajodhya. Their authority, however, was here much less durable than elsewhere, and the son of R\u00e1m Chand was permitted to succeed to the greater portion of his father's dominions in 1800. Within two years, this prince was murdered at the instigation of a vassal, and his brother, M\u00far Pahl\u00e1d, was placed upon the throne. He proved a dissolute and inefficient ruler, totally unable to curb his vassal Th\u00e1kurs, who, freebooters by training and hereditary disposition, made constant plundering expeditions into the territories of neighbouring princes, until at last, in 1811, their incursions on the villages of Gwalior provoked Sindhia to measures of retaliation. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 sent an army to capture Chanderi, under his partisan leader, Colonel Jean Baptiste; on whose approach, after capturing in succession the forts of Kotra, B\u00e1nsi, R\u00e1jw\u00e1ra, and L\u00e1litpur, M\u00far Pahl\u00e1d fled precipitately to Jh\u00e1nsi, leaving the defence of his capital to his generals. Despite a determined resistance, Chanderi was captured after a siege of several weeks through the treachery of one of the Chanderi Th\u00e1kurs; and T\u00e1lbehat soon afterwards surrendered. Sindhia then assumed the government, and appointed Colonel Baptiste as its administrator. The\njagirs were restored to their former owners, 31 villages being assigned for the support of R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00far Pahl\u00e1d.\n\nFor fifteen years this arrangement worked smoothly; but in 1829, the native Bundela turbulence showed itself once more in an insurrection, headed by the former R\u00e1j\u00e1. Colonel Baptiste again returned; and an agreement was entered into by which the Chanderi State was divided, one-third being retained by M\u00far Pahl\u00e1d, and two-thirds falling to the share of Sindhia. Even in these restricted dominions, M\u00far Pahl\u00e1d continued to have frequent quarrels with his subordinate chieftains until his death in 1842. He was succeeded by his son, Mardan Singh. Two years later, after the battle of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jpur, Sindhia ceded to the British Government all his share of the Chanderi State, as a guarantee for the maintenance of the Gwalior Contingent.\n\nThe territory so acquired was formed into a District, under the stipulation that the sovereignty of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 and the rights of the inhabitants should be respected. This arrangement continued in force until the outbreak of the Mutiny. Murdan Singh, known as the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of B\u00e1npur, had for some time considered himself aggrieved by the withholding of certain honours; and by his advice, the Bundela chiefs rose in rebellion in June 1857. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 himself occupied the passes to the south, and entered into communication with the mutineers at Jh\u00e1nsi. On the 12th of June, the 6th Gwalior Regiment mutinied, and its officers were forced to fly. Quarrels of the usual type then broke out between the mutineers and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of B\u00e1npur; but after a short time, the latter succeeded in making his authority good, and many native officials in the Government service took posts under him. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 asserted his complete independence, raised revenues in his own name, extorted money from the trading classes, plundered all who were supposed to favour the British Government, and established a cannon factory at B\u00e1npur. He even extended his rule into the northern portions of S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) District, which he held until the arrival of Sir Hugh Rose's force in January 1858, when, on being defeated at Banawadhia, he withdrew into Chanderi territory. On the 3rd of March 1858, the British army succeeded in forcing the passes leading into the plains of L\u00e1litpur, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 fell back towards B\u00e1npur and T\u00e1lbahat. The District was then partially pacified; but before the work could be completed, the revolt at Gwalior compelled the withdrawal of our troops, and the whole Chanderi country fell once more into the hands of the rebels. It was not till October 1858 that L\u00e1litpur was finally recovered, and even then only after a desperate resistance.\n\nThroughout the whole of this troubled period, it is noticeable that the Bundela Th\u00e1kurs themselves were in the forefront of disaffection, revolting long before the mutiny of the troops at L\u00e1litpur, and\nremaining hostile after the main centres of rebellion had been effectually reduced. They are in fact a body of half-savage chieftains, accustomed for centuries to a state of perpetual feud, and little adapted for the regular industrial life which the Government is endeavouring to render possible. Since the Mutiny, L\u00e1l\u00edtpur has been regularly organized as a British District, and has been free from any of those greater social disturbances which marked its early history. It has, however, been subject to the natural calamities of famine and pestilence, which have combined with the ravages of the Mutiny to impoverish still further its sterile soil, and to lessen by death or emigration its scanty population.\n\n**Population.**\u2014L\u00e1l\u00edtpur exhibits in the highest degree that decrease of inhabitants noticeable throughout the whole of Bundelkhand after the famine of 1868\u201369. The Census of 1865 gave the total population as 248,146. At the Census of 1872, the numbers had fallen to 212,661, showing a loss of 35,485 persons, or 14\u00b731 per cent., in seven years. This large depopulation must be attributed partly to the deaths by starvation and disease during the famine of 1868\u201369, but partly, also, to the exodus of labourers which then took place to more favoured tracts. Since 1872 the District has been free from serious calamity; and an increasing population, with extended cultivation, marks a considerable advancement in the former wretched condition of the people. The Census of 1881 returned the population at 249,088, or an increase of 36,427 (17\u00b71 per cent.), showing that the people have now recovered from the effects of the calamities of 1868\u201369. There were 750 villages in the District in 1865, 646 in 1872, and 670 in 1881.\n\nThe results of the Census of 1881 may be briefly summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 1947\u00b74 square miles; 670 inhabited and 79 uninhabited villages, and 34,181 occupied houses or enclosures. Total population, 249,088, namely, males 129,799, and females 119,289; proportion of males, 52\u00b71 per cent. Children under 15 years of age\u2014males 51,333, and females 45,304; total children, 96,637, or 38\u00b78 per cent. of population. Adults, males 78,466, and females 73,985; total adults 152,451, or 61\u00b72 per cent. Density of population, 128 persons per square mile; towns and villages per square mile, '34; persons per village, 371; houses per square mile, 17\u00b75; persons per house, 7\u00b72. With regard to religious divisions, L\u00e1l\u00edtpur District, like the remainder of Bundelkhand, is essentially Hindu; as many as 233,636, or 93\u00b779 per cent. of the inhabitants, professing some form of Hinduism; while the Musalm\u00e1ns number only 5368, or 2\u00b711 per cent. The remainder of the population consists of\u2014Jains, 10,029, or 4\u00b710 per cent.; Sikhs, 30; and Christians, 25.\n\nOf the superior classes of Hindus, the Br\u00e1hmans number 22,074 persons, and form a large proportion of the cultivators. The R\u00e1jputs or\nTh\u00e1kurs number 14,807, amongst whom the Jajh\u00e1riyas are the most numerous clan; but the Bundelas, who still retain much of their old supremacy, are socially and politically the most important. They were formerly a turbulent and aggressive race, averse to labour, and living by plunder. Under British rule, they have settled down into a peaceful landholding class, and now exist as a sort of feudal nobility. Their estates have much improved, and are not now heavily mortgaged to money-lenders as was formerly the case. The trading classes, or Baniy\u00e1s, including the Jains, who formerly represented the Vaisya or third class in the ancient fourfold Hindu social organization, number 12,233 souls, and they are the most active and money-making class in the District. The purely Hindu Baniy\u00e1s number 2204. The K\u00e1yasths or writer class, who mostly fill the ranks of the subordinate Government service, and are also landholders, clerks, etc., number 2449.\n\nThe great body of the population belongs to the clans enumerated in the Census returns as \u2018other castes.\u2019 Of these there are 192,102. The principal of these \u2018S\u00fadra\u2019 or low castes, arranged in numerical order, and not according to social rank, are as follow:\u2014Cham\u00e1rs, leather-workers and labourers, 29,766; Lodh\u00eds, landholders and cultivators, 26,122; Kachh\u00eds, gardeners, cultivators, and field labourers, 24,045; Ah\u00edrs, cattle-breeders, milk-sellers, and cultivators, 23,978; Kah\u00e1rs, palanquin-bearers, water-carriers, and fishermen, 6256; Tel\u00eds, oil-makers, 6186; K\u00farm\u00eds, landholders and cultivators, 6091; N\u00e1is, barbers, 6008; Gadari\u00e1s, sheep and goat breeders and wool-spinners, 5237. The other Hindu castes are all under 5000 in number.\n\nThe aboriginal races are represented by a few Gonds in the southern pargan\u00e1s, and about 11,000 Sah\u00e1riyas, scattered all over the District in the thickly wooded tracts. The latter are a very degraded type of humanity, subsisting till lately on the produce of the jungle, and by theft, and popularly described as more like monkeys than men. They have, however, much improved in circumstances of late years. They profess a low form of Hinduism, and are returned as Hindus in the Census Report, and in the religious classification given above. The Muhammadans are, almost without exception, Sunnis by religion, but as a class they possess neither wealth nor influence. The Christian population consists of 18 Europeans, 1 Eurasian, and 6 natives.\n\nTown and Rural Population.\u2014Only two towns contain a population exceeding five thousand inhabitants, namely LALITPUR (10,684) and TALBAHAT (5293), making a total urban population of 15,977, or a fraction less than 6\u00bd per cent. of the population of the District. The villages are mostly very small, and are thinly scattered over the plain. Very many villages were entirely deserted during the great famine of 1868\u201369; and although the population has recovered itself to the number at which it stood prior to that calamity, there were\nstill 79 villages uninhabited in 1881. The Census Report classifies the 670 inhabited villages as follows:\u2014303 with less than two hundred inhabitants, 229 from two to five hundred, 97 from five hundred to a thousand, 32 from one to two thousand, 6 from two to three thousand, 1 from three to five thousand, and 2 with upwards of five thousand inhabitants. In the villages, the houses of the lambard\u0101rs (or headmen) stand out conspicuously. They are built of small burnt bricks, set in mud or lime, with an upper storey and a loopholed wall. The villagers\u2019 huts are generally low mud-huts roofed with tiles or thatch, and plastered with cow-dung; although of late years, with the returning prosperity of the country, strongly-built slate and stone houses have become common. As a rule, the people are now comfortably clothed and shod, and well fed. Even the wild Sah\u0101riyas are able to wear decent clothing and shoes. The condition of field labourers is one of comfort, and the demand for labour has increased to such an extent that farm labourers by means of a strike have been able to enforce their demand for a payment in kind, of one-fifth and sometimes even one-fourth of a crop of jo\u00e1r.\n\nOne peculiarity of the District is the number of old forts met with in every part of the country. These are, for the most part, in ruins; those of most importance near towns and villages were dismantled by Sir Hugh Rose\u2019s force in 1858. Many of these were the residences of robber Th\u00e1kurs, whose practice of levying black-mail on all passers-by has only been restrained since the introduction of British rule. Numerous remains of old temples, the work of the Gonds, are scattered over the south of the District, especially in the neighbourhood of the Vindhyan hills, where there is an unlimited supply of good building stone. Modern Jain temples, erected as an act of piety by the Jain dealers and money-lenders, are common.\n\nClassified according to occupation, the Census Report returned the male population under the following six main headings:\u2014(1) Professional, including all Government servants, and the learned professions, 2478; (2) domestic and menial servants, 102; (3) commercial, including bankers, traders, carriers, etc., 2744; (4) agricultural, including gardeners, herdsmen, and shepherds, 57,911; (5) manufacturers and artisans, 17,783; (6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising general labourers 5083, male children, etc.), 48,781.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Out of a total area amounting to 1947 square miles, only 366 square miles (or less than one-fifth) were under tillage in 1872. By 1883\u201384, the area under cultivation had increased to 4018 square miles. The principal crops are wheat, gram, barley, jo\u00e1r, the coarser sorts of millet, pulses of various kinds, and other inferior food-grains, enumerated below. Jo\u00e1r is now the staple crop of the District, and its production has enormously increased of late years. In 1877,\nduring a local famine in Bhind Bhad\u00e1war in Gwalior State, thousands of the inhabitants passed through this District on their way to M\u00e1lw\u00e1, purchasing grain by the way. On their return to their own homes, they apparently reported favourably on the L\u00e1litpur jo\u00e1r, for since then many carts come here every year for the grain. To keep pace with the demand, the area under this crop is steadily increasing, and even in Districts north of L\u00e1litpur a large area is now sown with jo\u00e1r where it was never grown prior to 1877.\n\nCotton is grown in small quantities sufficient to supply local wants; but there is no surplus for export. Every village has a few small fields of tobacco, but vegetables are rarely cultivated, and garden produce is very scanty. Betel gardens occupy a small area; the produce of the P\u00e1li gardens is renowned, and it forms a considerable item of export. Two varieties of wheat (gehan) are grown; one sort is grown in black alluvial soil known as mot\u00ed with irrigation; and a smaller variety (pisiy\u00e1) is grown in light irrigated soil. Sugar-cane of three varieties is grown, but in very small quantities, and its cultivation is principally confined to pargan\u00e1 B\u00e1npur.\n\nThe crops are almost entirely dependent upon the rainfall, except on the soil known as mot\u00ed. Accordingly, the rabi or spring harvest, locally called unh\u00e1ri, is very small, amounting to only $24\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. of the total out-turn; while the khar\u00edf or autumn harvest, locally called say\u00e1ri, yields $75\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. The total area under khar\u00edf crops in 1883, was 245,202 acres, and rabi, 79,102 acres; grand total, 324,304 acres, or 505.5 square miles. This, however, includes lands bearing two crops in the year, the area of which is counted twice over. The acreage under the principal crops in 1883 was returned as follows:\n\n\u2014Khar\u00edf\u2014jo\u00e1r (Sorghum vulgare), 78,109 acres; maize, 9644; rice, 10,802; \u00fard or mung (Phaseolus mungo), 7744; kodon (Paspalum scrobiculatum), 37,616; r\u00e1li (Panicum miliaceum), 22,600; kutki, (Panicum miliare), 16,551; phikar, 8129; saw\u00e1n (Panicum frumentaceum), 5769; cotton, 2846; and al dye, 42,408 acres. Rabi\u2014wheat, 38,655 acres; wheat, mixed with barley or gram, 15,279; gram, 20,322; and masuri (Ervum lens), 2062 acres.\n\nIrrigation is little practised, not more than one-tenth of the cultivated area being artificially watered. Irrigation is carried on by means of wells fitted with the Persian wheel; by means of small canoes hollowed out of trunks of trees, weighted at one end, and worked by men at the other; also from tanks chiefly in the north of the District. The total irrigated area was returned at 22,222 acres in 1867, and 31,105 acres in 1883. On the red soil of the hilly tract no cold-weather crops can be grown at all without artificial water-supply; yet the people are very slow to avail themselves even of existing advantages. Rotation of crops is almost unknown, but land lies\nfallow for long periods, except where the rich black moti soil prevails. Manuring is generally practised in the case of all the more important products. L\u00e1litpur has not escaped the common plague of k\u00e1ns grass, which throughout all Bundelkhand has thrown many villages out of cultivation.\n\nTen acres form the average farm held with rights of occupancy, and seven acres the ordinary holding of a tenant-at-will. The latter, who form the most numerous class, are almost without exception in debt to the village banker. The total adult agricultural population (male and female) was returned by the Census of 1881 at 98,360, consisting of 2793 landholders, 75,346 cultivators, and 20,221 agricultural labourers and others. The total population, however, dependent on the soil was 165,197, or 66\u00b732 per cent. of the entire inhabitants of the District. Of the total area of L\u00e1litpur, 1947 square miles, 403 square miles are held revenue free, leaving 1544 square miles assessed for Government revenue. Of the assessed area, 402 square miles are returned as under cultivation, 835 square miles as cultivable but not under tillage, and 307 square miles as uncultivable waste. Total Government assessment, including local rates and cesses, \u00a317,557, or an average of 1s. 4d. per cultivated acre. Total rental, including rates and cesses (expressed in a money value), paid by the cultivators, \u00a334,029, or an average of 2s. 3\u00bdd. per cultivated acre.\n\nRents are usually fixed in proportion to the crops. The average rates (expressed in money) are\u2014for irrigated black soil, on two-crop lands, 8s.\u2014on one-crop lands, 6s.; for irrigated red soil on two-crop lands, 6s.\u2014on one-crop lands, 5s.; for unirrigated soil, black, 3s. 6d.\u2014mixed, 2s. 6d.\u2014red, 1s. 3d. The labourers belong to all castes, and are generally paid in grain. Non-agricultural wages are reported as follows:\u2014Coolies, 1\u00bdd. to 3d. per diem:\u2014smiths, carpenters, masons, tailors, etc.\u2014first-class, 6d.; second-class, 4\u00bdd. L\u00e1litpur has not participated in the general rise of wages which has taken place throughout the greater part of Bundelkhand during the last twenty years, these rates being the same as those current in 1858; the exception is probably owing to the remoteness of the District, which has been little affected by the development of the railway system. Prices, however, have nearly doubled during the same period. The following were the average current rates of food-grains in 1883:\u2014Common rice, 15 sers per rupee, or 7s. 6d. per cwt.; wheat, 20\u00bd sers per rupee, or 5s. 5d. per cwt.; gram and jo\u00e1r, 36 sers per rupee, or 3s. 1d. per cwt.; b\u00e1jra, 28 sers per rupee, or 4s. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014L\u00e1litpur is subject to loss of crops from blight, hailstorms, and the ravages of locusts; but its principal enemy is drought, to which the great famine of 1868-69 was mainly due. The\nkharif or autumn crop of 1868 failed almost entirely, through long-\ncontinued want of rain; and the rabi or spring harvest of 1869 pro-\nduced only half its usual amount. Relief measures were commenced\nin August 1868; and during the next thirteen months an average number\nof 5599 persons were daily assisted with work, while 2781 persons\nreceived gratuitous relief at poorhouses. In February 1869, the total\ndaily average of persons relieved was over 20,000. The maximum\nprice of wheat and gram during the dearth was 7 sers the rupee, or\nabout 16s. per cwt. Epidemics, as usual, followed in the wake of\nfamine; cholera broke out in June 1869, and raged amongst the debili-\ntated and starving people during the rainy season. Every effort was\nmade to prevent actual starvation; yet 500 deaths were reported as due\nto that cause; and there can be little doubt that these figures do not\nby any means represent the real numbers. The total loss of inhabitants\nby death and emigration was enormous. As much as 76 per cent. of\nthe people relieved were women and children, the majority of whom\nbelonged to families whose male members had deserted them and gone\noff elsewhere as soon as the failure of the crops was generally anticipated.\nEven after the famine abated, distress continued for a considerable\nperiod, as there were not enough cultivators left to till the ground, and\n41 per cent. of the cattle had been lost, 95,543 head out of a total stock\namounting to 233,047 having died from starvation or other causes.\nGovernment endeavoured to alleviate these calamities by large advances\nfor the purpose of buying seed and beasts; but much of the money so\ngranted was really spent upon food to supply existing necessities, and\na considerable period elapsed before the land was restored to cultivation.\nThe communications are insufficient to avert actual famine, and many\nportions of the District are in danger of isolation from floods. On the\nwhole, in all seasons of scarcity the condition of L\u00e1litpur must be\nconsidered specially critical.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014Until recently the foodstuffs raised in L\u00e1lit-\npur were only just sufficient even in favourable seasons to satisfy the\nhome consumption, and there was but little export trade; while in times of\nscarcity it became necessary to import considerable quantities of grain.\nThe regular commerce was very small; the only out-going products\nbeing betel-leaves, clarified butter (gh\u012b), lac, honey, wax, and forest pro-\nduce; and the imported articles being chiefly salt, grain, sugar, cloth, and\ntobacco. As explained, however, on a previous page, a great extension\nof jo\u0101r cultivation has taken place since 1877, and large exports of this\ngrain take place every year, principally into Gwalior territory. The\nmanufactures are unimportant, and belong entirely to the domestic type.\nThe District is still remote from all portions of the railway system.\nThere is one good through road, metalled throughout between Jh\u00e1nsi\nand S\u00e1gar (Saugor), known as the Bundelkhand road, having a length of\n57 miles within this District. The other roads are unmetalled, and in many cases unbridged, so that communications are often rendered impossible after heavy rains. The total length of roads in the District in 1883 was 460 miles. There are no railroads or navigable rivers. The District does not contain any noticeable institution, and there are no newspapers or printing-presses.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1860\u201361, the total revenue amounted to \u00a331,031, of which \u00a314,513, or nearly one-half, was contributed by the land-tax. The expenditure at the same date was \u00a315,808. By 1870\u201371 the total receipts had increased to \u00a334,677, of which \u00a314,881 was made up by land revenue; while the expenditure had decreased to \u00a310,321, or less than one-third of the receipts. The retrenchment was mainly effected in the items of Justice and Police. In 1881\u201382 the total receipts amounted to \u00a340,370, of which \u00a315,047 was made up by land revenue. The expenditure for the same year was \u00a319,055. L\u00e1litpur suffered, like other neighbouring Districts, from over-assessment during the native period; and the rates continued high before the Mutiny; but at present a much lighter settlement has been introduced, which will remain in force till 1888.\n\nL\u00e1litpur District is administered, on the non-regulation system, by a Deputy Commissioner, 1 Assistant, and 1 extra-Assistant Commissioner, and 2 tahsild\u00e1rs. In 1883 they presided over 5 magisterial and 5 civil courts. There are 18 police stations, and the regular District and town police force numbered 421 men, maintained at a cost of \u00a34717, almost entirely from imperial funds. Besides these, the District contains 484 village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), or 1 to every 514 inhabitants; annual cost of maintenance, \u00a31750. The total machinery for the protection of person and property accordingly consists of 905 men, giving 1 man to every 2'15 square miles and to every 275 of the population. The number of convictions for all offences in 1883 amounted to 529, or 1 in every 470 inhabitants. The Sah\u00e1riyas, a class of professional thieves recruited from various low castes, well known to the police throughout India, are numerous in the District, and cause much trouble. These people originally came from the country in the neighbourhood of Delhi, and settled down in Bundelkhand, Gwalior State, and the neighbouring Districts of the Central Provinces many years ago. They are a wandering gang of persons associated for the purpose of committing thefts, which they carry out at a distance from their homes, notably in Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t) and the Bombay Districts. In 1883 the jail contained a daily average of 75 inmates, the total number of admissions during the year being 369.\n\nEducation during the last few years has not only failed to make any progress in L\u00e1litpur, but has retrograded. In 1860 there were 27 inspected schools, attended by 677 pupils, and maintained at\na cost of \u00a3182; by 1870 the number of schools had risen to 39, and that of pupils to 1254, while \u00a3613 was expended on instruction. In 1883-84, however, the number of State-inspected schools was returned at only 28, attended by 975 pupils, the cost of State education being \u00a3516. This is exclusive of uninspected and unaided schools; but the Census of 1881 returned only 1247 boys and 15 girls as under instruction, besides 5563 males and 43 females able to read and write, but not under instruction.\n\nThe District is divided into 2 tahsils and 7 parganas. The number of revenue-paying estates in 1871 was 641, owned by 4946 registered proprietors or coparceners, and paying a revenue of \u00a314,881; each estate accordingly bore an average burden of \u00a321, 18s., and each coparcener contributed an average share of \u00a32, 16s. Sub-division of property has slightly increased of late years, and in 1881-82 there were 654 separate estates, owned by 5295 proprietors and coparceners; each estate paying an average of \u00a322, 10s., and each individual proprietor an average of \u00a32, 9s. 6d. The District contains only 1 municipality, L\u00e1litpur town. In 1883-84, its total income amounted to \u00a31114, and its expenditure to \u00a3871. The incidence of municipal taxation was at the rate of 1s. 7\u00bdd. per head of population.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of L\u00e1litpur is distinguished by a continuous heat, though the extremes of temperature are not so marked as in the Upper Provinces, or even in neighbouring Districts, and the cold weather is bracing. The annual rainfall averages 38\u00b716 inches; in 1867-68 it rose as high as 59\u00b78 inches, while in the disastrous season of 1868-69 it fell to 13\u00b70 inches. In 1881 the rainfall was 37\u00b758 inches, or 0\u00b758 of an inch below the average. No thermometrical returns are available. The total number of deaths reported in 1883 amounted to 6825, or 27\u00b743 to every 1000 inhabitants, of which one-fourth (1553) were assigned to fever. Snake-bites and the attacks of wild animals are set down as causing 89 deaths in 1883. The average death-rate for the previous five years is returned as 34\u00b755 per thousand. Cattle-disease occurs yearly in a mild form; and rinderpest, combined with foot-and-mouth disease, appeared as an epidemic in 1871. The natives consider it inevitable, and take no measures for its suppression.\n\n[For further information regarding L\u00e1litpur, see the Gazetteer of the North-Western Provinces, by Mr. E. T. Atkinson, C.S., vol. i. pp. 304-360 (Government Press, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, 1874); the Settlement Report of L\u00e1litpur District, by Colonel J. Davidson (1873); the Census Report of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh for 1881; and the several Provincial Administration and Departmental Reports from 1880 to 1884.]\n\nL\u00e1litpur.\u2014Western tahsil of L\u00e1litpur District, North-Western Provinces, consisting of the parganas of L\u00e1litpur, B\u00e1nsi, T\u00e1lbeh\u00e1t, and\nB\u00e1l\u00e1beh\u00e1t. Area, 1059 square miles, of which only 234 square miles were cultivated in 1881. Population (1872) 118,997; (1881) 138,516, namely, males 72,606, and females 65,910. Total increase of population during the nine years, 19,519, or 16'4 per cent. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 129,776; Muhammadans, 3374; Jains, 5324; and \u2018others,\u2019 42. Of the 376 villages comprising the tahsil, 301 contained less than five hundred inhabitants. Land revenue (1881), \u00a37614; total Government revenue, including local rates and cesses levied on land, \u00a39315; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a317,451. Excluding the head-quarters courts, the tahsil contains 1 civil and 1 criminal court. Number of police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 10, besides 3 outpost stations. Strength of regular police, 120 men, with 242 village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs).\n\nL\u00e1litpur.\u2014Town, municipality, and administrative head-quarters of L\u00e1litpur District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 24\u00b0 41\u2032 30\u2033 N., long. 78\u00b0 27\u2032 50\u2033 E. Situated on the Jh\u00e1nsi and S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) road, close to the west bank of the Sahj\u00e1d Nadi. Many of the inhabitants are agriculturists. Population (1872) 8976; (1881) 10,684, namely, males 5655, and females 5029. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 8256; Muhammadans, 1323; Jains, 1072; Christians, 11; and \u2018others,\u2019 22. Area of town site, 1015 acres. Well-built, white-washed masonry houses give picturesqueness to the main streets; but the side streets consist of mere tortuous alleys. An excellent modern b\u00e1z\u00e1r, built by a late Government officer, forms a good centre for the town. Buddhist remains are built into the walls. Tahsili, jail, police station, Government charitable dispensary. For Mutiny narrative, see LALITPUR DISTRICT. Municipal revenue in 1883\u201384, \u00a31114, of which \u00a3839 was from octroi; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 7\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits.\n\nL\u00e1lm\u00e1i Hills.\u2014A low range in Hill Tipperah District, Bengal, nowhere exceeding 100 feet in height; about 5 miles west of Comillah (Kumill\u00e1). The range extends 10 miles north and south, with an average breadth of about 2 miles. Densely wooded, and cultivated by the Tipperahs on the j\u00fam system of nomadic tillage. Brown iron-ore (hydrated sesquioxide) is found, but not abundantly, which yields 38\u00bd per cent. of iron. Silver ore in small quantities has recently been found, but it is not probable that it can be worked at a profit. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Tipperah, to whom the L\u00e1lm\u00e1i with the Mayn\u00e1m\u00e1ti Hills were sold for \u00a32100 by the British Government, has built a house for the use of Europeans on the highest elevation, known as the Mayn\u00e1m\u00e1ti Hill. An old fort, with statues and bas-reliefs, was found buried in the jungle. The snake figures in the sculptures, and the presence of the pig, indicate an aboriginal or non-Hindu origin. The range takes its name from a princess, L\u00e1lm\u00e1i, of the royal house of Tipperah.\nL\u00e1lsot.\u2014Town in Dausa District, Jaipur (Jeypore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, situated about 40 miles south of Jaipur city. Population (1881) 8743. Hindus number 8046; Muhammadans, 506; \u2018others,\u2019 191.\n\nLambia.\u2014Mountain pass in Bashahr State, Punjab, over the Him\u00e1layan range bounding Kun\u00e1war to the south. Seldom used, on account of the cracks and sinking snow, except during the summer months. Lat., according to Thornton, 31\u00b0 16\u2032 N., long. 78\u00b0 20\u2032 E.; elevation above sea-level, about 17,000 feet.\n\nLandaur (Landour).\u2014Hill cantonment and sanitarium in Dehra D\u00fan District, North-Western Provinces. It forms at present a single town with Mussooree (Masuri), but with distinct jurisdiction, which is vested in the cantonment magistrate. Lat. 30\u00b0 27\u2032 30\u2033 N., long. 78\u00b0 8\u2032 30\u2033 E.; situated on the slopes of the Him\u00e1layas, 7459 feet above sea-level. A convalescent station for European soldiers was established in 1827, the average number of invalids being about 300 in the summer, and 100 in the winter months. The staff comprises a commandant, surgeon, and station staff officer. The united towns of Landaur and Mussooree have a permanent Anglo-Indian population of 408 persons, according to the Census of 1881, largely increased by the influx of visitors from the plains during the hot season. A special Census taken in 1880 in September, when the population is at its height, returned the inhabitants of Landaur cantonment at 4428, namely, Hindus, 2244; Muhammadans, 1457; Europeans, 679; Eurasians, 38; Native Christians, 6; and \u2018others,\u2019 4. Landaur with Mussooree contains two Protestant and one Roman Catholic church, post-office, several hotels, numerous schools, and boarding-houses. For further details, see Mussooree.\n\nLandaura.\u2014Town in R\u00farki (Roorkee) tahsil, Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur District, North-Western Provinces, situated on the open plain, 5 miles south-east of R\u00farki, and 28 miles east of Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur town, in lat. 29\u00b0 48\u2032 N., and long. 77\u00b0 58\u2032 15\u2033 E. Population (1872) 5023; (1881) 5764, namely, Hindus, 3731; and Muhammadans, 1833. Village school; post-office; old fort, surrounded by a ditch, now converted into a receptacle for the sewage of the town. The inhabitants are chiefly G\u00fajars, clansmen of the notorious chieftain R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1mday\u00e1l Singh. The village was burnt for excesses committed during the Mutiny.\n\nL\u00e1nd\u00ed Kh\u00e1na.\u2014The most difficult part of the Afghan end of the Kha\u00edbar Pass, Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n; about 23 miles distant from Kadam, the eastern entrance, and about 7 miles from the western entrance. Elevation of L\u00e1nd\u00ed Kh\u00e1na village (lat. 34\u00b0 3\u2032 N., long. 71\u00b0 3\u2032 E.), 2488 feet; highest point of the pass, the L\u00e1nd\u00ed Kot\u00e1l or fort, 3373 feet. L\u00e1nd\u00ed Kot\u00e1l is one of the principal stages in the pass, and has been used as a halting-place for the different British forces when passing through the Kh\u00e1ibar. The sara\u00ed, or camping ground for travellers and caravans, at L\u00e1nd\u00ed Kot\u00e1l is protected by a low rampart and ditch. A body of\nthe Irregular Levies, raised from the tribes of the pass, and under the direction of the British Political Officer in charge of the Kh\u00e1ibar, is now (1885) stationed at L\u00e1nd\u00ed Kot\u00e1l. Just beyond L\u00e1nd\u00ed Kot\u00e1l rises the peak popularly known as Pisgah, whence the British officers who held L\u00e1nd\u00ed Kot\u00e1l during the late Afgh\u00e1n war were wont to survey the plains of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n as far as Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d. Shortly beyond L\u00e1nd\u00ed Kot\u00e1l, the Pass narrows to the gorge of L\u00e1nd\u00ed Kh\u00e1na; and a few miles further it debouches on the open country of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n. Caravans entering the pass give up their Afgh\u00e1n escort, and are taken charge of by the Irregular Levies under British control, near L\u00e1nd\u00ed Kh\u00e1na.\n\n**Lang\u00e1i.**\u2014River in the south-east of Sylhet District, Assam, which rises beyond the frontier, and, flowing northwards, forms the boundary between the Lush\u00e1i hills and the State of Hill Tipperah. It ultimately falls into the Kusi\u00e1ra branch of the Surm\u00e1 or Bar\u00e1k near the village of Kar\u00edmganj. It is navigable for large boats in the rains, but in the cold season for only small boats. On its banks are forests of *jar\u00fal* (Lagerstroemia Flos-Regin\u00e6) and *n\u00e1g\u00e9svar* (Mesua ferrea), forming the most important forest reserve in Sylhet. The Lang\u00e1i has also given its name to a valuable elephant *mah\u00e1l* or hunting-ground, reserved for the operations of the Commissariat *kh\u00e9d\u00e1*.\n\n**Langrin** (or *Lang-rin*).\u2014Petty State in the Kh\u00e1si Hills, Assam, presided over by a *siem* or chief called U Bor. Population (1881) 1152; revenue, \u00a3176, chiefly derived from dues levied on lime. The products are rice, millet, chillies, turmeric; limestone is largely quarried, and coal has been found.\n\n**Langt\u00e1r\u00e1\u00ed** (or more probably *Laktr\u00e1i*, the name of a god of the hill people).\u2014Hill range in the State of Hill Tipperah, Bengal; runs through the State in a northerly direction, gradually disappearing in the plains of Sylhet. The principal peaks are\u2014Pheng Pui, 1581; and Sim Basia, 1544 feet. These hills, like the other Tipperah ranges, are covered with dense bamboo jungle and huge forest timber.\n\n**Lang\u00fal\u00edy\u00e1** (*Langala*, Sanskrit; *N\u00e1gula*, Telugu\u2014'a plough').\u2014River formed by the junction of three streams rising in the Gondw\u00e1na mountains, near Kal\u00e1handi, Central Provinces. It flows south-east across the territory of Jaipur (Jeypore), into the plains of the Madras Presidency. In the last 30 miles of its course, the Lang\u00fal\u00edy\u00e1 forms the boundary between Vizagapatam and Ganj\u00e1m Districts, entering the sea below Chicacole (in the latter District), where it is crossed by the Great Trunk Road on a fine bridge of 24 arches, much injured by the cyclone of 1876. The whole course of the river is about 140 miles; and on its banks are the towns of Singap\u00far, Birada, and R\u00e1yagadda in Jaipur, and P\u00e1rvatip\u00far, P\u00e1lkonda, and Chicacole in the plains. Its principal tributaries are the Sal\u00far and Makkuv\u00e1. The Lang\u00fal\u00edy\u00e1 irrigates the P\u00e1lkonda\ndivision of the Chicacole taluk, and part of the Salur and Bobbili estates. Its rapid current makes navigation difficult, but during the floods bamboos are floated down from the hill forests.\n\n**Langur.**\u2014Ruined hill fort in Garhw\u00e1l District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 55' N., and long. 78\u00b0 40' E., on a conical hill forming part of one of the southern Himalayan ranges. Very difficult of access, and, from a military point of view, quite valueless, there being no water. Elevation above sea, 6401 feet.\n\n**Lanj\u00ed.**\u2014Town in B\u00farh\u00e1 tahsil, B\u00e1lg\u00e1h\u00e1t District, Central Provinces; 40 miles east of B\u00farh\u00e1 town. Lat. 21\u00b0 30' N., long. 80\u00b0 35' E. Lying in low ground dotted with tanks, and bounded on the north by dense jungle, in which stands an old temple dedicated to Mah\u00e1deva, surrounded apparently by the remains of the original town. The fort, now out of repair, but once a strong place, was probably constructed by the Gonds, circa 1700. On the edge of the moat round it, a temple has been built to L\u00e1njk\u00e1i (the goddess K\u00e1l\u00ed), from whom the town takes its name. Population (1881) 2240, namely, Hindus, 1990; Muhammadans, 151; Jain, 1; and aboriginal tribes, 98. Lanj\u00ed has a good Government school, and a police station; and the District post connects it with the imperial postal lines.\n\n**L\u00e1o-bah.**\u2014Mountain range in the District of the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed and Jaintia Hills, Assam; elevation of highest peak above sea-level, 4464 feet.\n\n**L\u00e1o-ber-s\u00e1t.**\u2014Mountain range in the District of the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed and Jaintia Hills, Assam; elevation of highest peak above sea-level, 5400 feet.\n\n**L\u00e1o-syn-nia.**\u2014Mountain range in the District of the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed and Jaintia Hills, Assam; elevation of highest peak above sea-level, 5775 feet.\n\n**L\u00e1ph\u00e1.**\u2014Zamind\u00e1r\u00ed estate in the north of Bil\u00e1spur District, Central Provinces, said to date from 936 A.D. Area, 272 square miles, with 72 villages and 2024 houses. Population (1881) 12,252, namely, males 6421, and females 5831. Of the total area, only about 12,000 acres, or about 20 square miles, are cultivated. The zamind\u00e1r is a Kunwar by caste.\n\n**L\u00e1ph\u00e1g\u00e1rh.**\u2014Hill fortress in Bil\u00e1spur District, Central Provinces; 25 miles north of Bil\u00e1spur town. Lat. 26\u00b0 41' N., long. 91\u00b0 9' E. Crowning the L\u00e1ph\u00e1 Hill, which rises 3200 feet above sea-level, with an open area on the top of 3 square miles, now overgrown with underwood. On this cool and pleasant plateau the Haihai B\u00e1ns\u00ed rulers of Chhatt\u00edsgarh had one of their earliest seats, till they left, over a thousand years ago, for their capital of Ratanpur. Much of the fort wall, constructed of large slabs of hewn stone, still remains in excellent preservation.\n\n**Larawar.**\u2014Parg\u00e1na in the Sund\u00e1rsi division of the States of Dh\u00e1r and Dew\u00e1s, under the Bhop\u00e1l Agency, Central India. Area, 30 square\nmiles; estimated population (1881) 3000; estimated revenue, \u00a3700. This parg\u00e1na, comprising 6 villages, was held in j\u00e1gir by R\u00e1m Chandra R\u00e1o Pu\u00e1r; on whose death in 1880 it lapsed to the above-named States. His nephew, Vithal R\u00e1o Pu\u00e1r, receives a subsistence allowance of \u00a320 a month, viz. \u00a316, 13s. from Dh\u00e1r, and \u00a33, 7s. from Dew\u00e1s.\n\nL\u00e1rh\u00e1na.\u2014Sub-division of Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency, lying between lat. 27\u00b0 16' 30\" and 28\u00b0 4' 30\" N., and between long. 67\u00b0 15' and 68\u00b0 32' 30\" E. In 1881 this Sub-division comprised five t\u00e1luks, namely, L\u00e1rh\u00e1na, Labdary\u00e1, Kambar, Rato Dero, and Sij\u00e1wal. Since then Government has sanctioned the formation of a new t\u00e1luk, to be formed of part of the t\u00e1luks of Rato Dero, Sij\u00e1wal, and Kambar. The new t\u00e1luk is to be named Sh\u00e1hd\u00e1dpur, and to form part of the Upper Sind Frontier District. The following paragraphs treat of L\u00e1rh\u00e1na Sub-division as it stood before these transfers took place.\n\nArea, 1894 square miles. Population (1881) 281,717. Bounded on the north by the Frontier District and the territory of the Kh\u00e1n of Khel\u00e1t; east by the Indus and the Sukkur (Sakhar) and Shik\u00e1rpur Sub-division; south and west by Mehar, Khel\u00e1t, and the Khirthar range. With the exception of the western portion, which borders on the Khirthar Mountains, the general aspect of the country is singularly flat and uninteresting. Those parts of L\u00e1rh\u00e1na lying between the Indus and the western N\u00e1r\u00e1, and again between the latter stream and the Gh\u00e1r Canal, are one dead level of rich alluvial soil, well cultivated, and, on the whole, thickly populated. They form one of the most typical examples of high-class cultivation in Sind. In other parts of the Sub-division stretch vast plains of kalar or saline soil, while in the vicinity of the Indus broken patches of sandy waste or low jungles of tamarisk and bab\u00fal occur. Canals are numerous, and afford great facilities for irrigation. The principal Government canals in the Sub-division are the Western N\u00e1r\u00e1, 30 miles long, and 100 feet wide at its mouth; the Gh\u00e1r, 22 miles long and 80 feet wide; the Naurang, a continuation of the Gh\u00e1r canal, 21 miles long and 90 feet wide; the Bire-ji-k\u00far, 27 miles long and 48 feet wide; and the Edenw\u00e1h, 23 miles long. Of the zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri or private canals, the Sh\u00e1h-ji-k\u00far and D\u00e1te-ji-k\u00far, both 22 miles long, and the M\u00edr, 20 miles long, are the most important. The Western N\u00e1r\u00e1, navigable by boats from May to September, is very tortuous in its course, and may be regarded as a river artificially improved. After flowing through portions of the L\u00e1rh\u00e1na, Rato Dero, and Labdary\u00e1 t\u00e1luks, it enters the Mehar Sub-division, and falls eventually into the Manchhar Lake. The Gh\u00e1r, which is also supposed to be a natural channel, is very winding, broad, and deep, with level banks. It flows through the L\u00e1rh\u00e1na and Rato Dero t\u00e1luks, and enters Mehar by the Nasir\u00e1b\u00e1d t\u00e1luk. The Government forests in L\u00e1rh\u00e1na cover an area of from\n9000 to 10,000 acres. The chief trees are the *nim*, *sissu*, *babul*, *pipal*, and *karil*. The tamarisk is occasionally met with of a large growth; it is very plentiful, and valuable as firewood. The principal minerals are coarse salt and saltpetre. Alum and sulphur occur in the hills to the west. The wild animals include the tiger, hog, antelope, hyaena, jackal, wolf, fox, porcupine, and ibex.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The total population of L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na Sub-division was returned in 1856 at 148,903; by 1872, the number of inhabitants had risen to 234,575, of whom 202,008 were Muhammadans, 32,381 Hindus, and 186 of other nationalities. In 1881, the number of inhabitants was returned at 281,717, namely, 152,512 males and 129,205 females, dwelling in 433 villages and 3 towns, and occupying 40,516 houses. Muhammadans numbered 243,664; Hindus, 14,649; Sikhs, 23,242; aboriginal tribes, 126; Christians, 24; Buddhists, 6; Pars\u00eds, 5; and Jews, 1. Density of population, 149 persons per square mile. The chief Musalm\u00e1n tribes are the Ch\u00e1ndias, Jam\u00e1lis, Abras, and J\u00e1ts. It is from the first that this part of the country obtained the name of Ch\u00e1nduka or Ch\u00e1ndko. The Jam\u00e1lis are a Baluch race living on the borders of the desert; the Abras inhabit the south-west of L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na; the J\u00e1ts are found dispersed all over the Sub-division, and are mainly cultivators and cattle-breeders. The chief towns are L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na (the headquarters), Rato Dero, and Kambar. Among the few antiquities of L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na, the principal are the old fort in L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na town, the tomb of Sh\u00e1hal Muhammad Kalhora (built about 150 years ago), and of his minister Sh\u00e1h Bah\u00e1rah. Sh\u00e1hal Muhammad was the grandson of Adam Sh\u00e1h, the celebrated f\u00e1kir (religious mendicant), whose descendants eventually became monarchs of Sind.\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na contains a portion of one of the finest alluvial tracts in the whole Province, viz. that lying between the Indus, the N\u00e1r\u00e1, and the Gh\u00e1r. There is, perhaps, no part of Sind so admirably suited for irrigation; and the soil is so productive as to have procured for this tract the name of the \u2018Garden of Sind.\u2019 Three principal crops are raised during the year, viz.\u2014*peshras*, sown in March and reaped in July; *khar\u00edf*, sown in June and July, and reaped in November and December; and *rabi*, sown in September and October, and reaped in April and May. The *peshras* crop includes cotton, sugar-cane, and vegetables; the *khar\u00edf*\u2014jo\u00e1r, b\u00e1jra, *til*, rice, indigo, pulses, and hemp; the *rabi*\u2014wheat, barley, oil-seeds, gram, peas, and tobacco. Mangoes, plantains, dates, limes, pomegranates, and other fruits are grown extensively. The first revenue settlement of the Sub-division was made by Major Goldney, in 1847; it was for seven years, and expired in 1853\u201354. The rates were heavy, *rabi* land being assessed as high as 5 rupees 1 anna (10s. 1\u00bdd.) per acre, and *khar\u00edf* and *peshras* lands at 3 rupees 1 anna (6s. 1\u00bdd.). In 1855\u201356, the rates in L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na and Kambar *t\u00e1luk*s\nwere reduced according as the cultivation was by wheel or well. The average rate on assessed cultivable land in L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na is now 2s. 6\\(\\frac{3}{10}\\)d. per acre. In 1882\u201383, the area assessed to land revenue was 352,205 acres; and the area under actual cultivation was 306,467 acres.\n\nTenures.\u2014Before the conquest of Sind by the British in 1843, this part of the Province was known as the Ch\u00e1ndko pargan\u00e1, and the ownership of the entire lands in each village seems then to have been vested in the zamind\u00e1rs and their heirs in perpetuity. They cultivated a portion themselves, leaving the rest to men who appear to have possessed a hereditary right to occupy, as the lands could not be taken from them at pleasure; but they paid l\u00e1po, or rent, to the zamind\u00e1r, generally in kind, at so many k\u00e1sas per bigh\u00e1. Besides this there was a fee called w\u00e1jah zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, claimed by the head-man, and leviable on the produce of the lands. When a portion of the land was sold, the purchaser became entitled to the l\u00e1po, but the w\u00e1jah was still given to the head-man. The zam\u00ednd\u00e1r, in fact, only transacted business with Government or the contractor, and he made his own collections from the tenants. The villagers paid him great respect, and his advice was generally acted upon in all the agricultural affairs of the community. The j\u00e1gir land in this Sub-division, cultivable and uncultivable, comprises in all about 84,000 acres, of which Ghaibi Kh\u00e1n Ch\u00e1ndia\u2019s estate in the Kambar t\u00e1luk takes up 75,966 acres.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na is subject to floods or l\u00e9t\u00eds, which at times cause great destruction to life and property. In 1874, the Kashmor l\u00e9t, starting from the town of the same name in the Frontier District, conjointly with the Jhali l\u00e9t, originating in the Sukkur and Shik\u00e1rpur Sub-division, inundated nearly 100,000 acres of waste and cultivated land, besides destroying in a greater or less degree 53 villages. Strong embankments or bandhs have been raised, but hitherto without any permanent effect.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The manufactures of L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na consist principally of coarse cotton cloth, salt, paper; working in metals, such as culinary utensils, etc.; shoes, native saddles, and other leather work. There is also a small paper manufactory at the town of L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na. Dyeing forms an important industry. The Sub-division carries on an extensive trade. The exports comprise grain of sorts, wool, cotton, and other agricultural products; the imports\u2014English piece-goods, silks, and fruits. L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na town is one of the chief grain marts of Sind. The total length of roads in the Sub-division is above 400 miles. The main road is that from L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na to Shik\u00e1rpur, southwards to Mehar. There are 17 ferries, most of which cross the Indus or the West N\u00e1r\u00e1 Canal. Post-offices at the towns of L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na, Kambar, and Rato Dero.\n\nThe revenue of the Sub-division in 1881\u201382 was \u00a393,709; being \u00a388,112 imperial, and \u00a35597 local, derived from the following\nsources:\u2014Imperial\u2014land-tax, \u00a380,772; abk\u00e1ri or excise, \u00a32510; drugs and opium, \u00a31070; stamps, \u00a33274; registration, \u00a3381: Local\u2014cesses on land, \u00a35019; percentage on alienated lands, \u00a346; ferry funds, \u00a3125; fisheries, \u00a3378; fees and licences, \u00a329. There are 3 municipalities in L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na, viz. L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na, Rato Dero, and Kambar, with a total revenue in 1881\u201382 of \u00a33322. Dispensary at L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na town. The number of Government schools in 1882 was 22, with 934 pupils. In 1884 the Sub-division contained 1 civil and 9 criminal courts; police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 20; regular police, 154 men.\n\nThe average annual rainfall at L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na is returned at 5'17 inches. Fevers, rheumatism, and ophthalmia are prevalent.\n\nL\u00e1rkh\u00e1na.\u2014T\u00e1luk of L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na Sub-division, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Area, 290\u00b76 square miles. Population (1881) 97,140, namely, 52,796 males and 44,344 females, dwelling in 75 villages and towns, and occupying 13,378 houses. Muhammadans numbered 82,341; Hindus, 5579; Sikhs, 9208; Christians, 7; Jews, 1; and P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 5. The area assessed to land revenue in 1882\u201383, 94,012 acres; area under actual cultivation, 90,717 acres. Revenue in 1881\u201382, \u00a341,450, being \u00a339,104 imperial and \u00a32346 local. In 1884, the t\u00e1luk contained 1 civil and 3 criminal courts, 5 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), and 58 regular police.\n\nL\u00e1rkh\u00e1na.\u2014Chief town and municipality of the L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na Sub-division, Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Situated in lat. 27\u00b0 33' N., and long. 68\u00b0 15' E., on the south bank of the Gh\u00e1r Canal; 40 miles south-west of Shik\u00e1rpur town, and 36 north-east of Mehar. The country surrounding L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na is fertile and populous, and perhaps the finest tract in the whole of Sind. The spacious walks, well laid-out gardens, and luxuriant foliage, have gained for L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na the title of the \u2018Eden of Sind.\u2019 The principal buildings are the civil court, and the usual public offices, Assistant Collector\u2019s and travellers\u2019 bungalows, dispensary, 3 b\u00e1z\u00e1rs. In the time of the Talpur M\u00edrs the fort served as an arsenal, and afterwards, under British rule, it was turned into an hospital and jail. The population in 1881 was returned at 13,188, namely, 7155 males and 6033 females. Muhammadans numbered 7402; Hindus, 1699; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 5; Christians, 2; and \u2018others,\u2019 4080. L\u00e1rkh\u00e1na is one of the most important grain marts of Sind, and is famous for a species of rice called sugd\u00e1si. Large local traffic in metals, cloth, and leather. The principal manufactures are cloth of mixed silk and cotton, coarse cotton cloth, metal vessels, and leather goods. The antiquities consist of the old fort already mentioned, and the tomb of Sh\u00e1h Bah\u00e1rah. The income of the municipality in 1882\u201383 was \u00a32230; and the incidence of taxation, 2s. 5\u00bed. per head of population.\n\nLashkarpur.\u2014Village in the south-west of Sylhet District, Assam, vol. viii.\non the Kwahi river. Lat. $24^\\circ 16' 25''$ N., long. $91^\\circ 30' 30''$ E. The village is celebrated for several handicrafts. A little colony of Musalm\u00e1ns manufacture talw\u00e1rs or swords, and d\u00e1os or hill knives, skilfully damascening the blades with silver and brass. In the neighbourhood, lac is collected from the branches of trees of the fig order, and worked up into a variety of elegant articles known as puk\u00e1l\u00ed work. In some cases, the lac is tastefully inlaid with the blue feathers of the king-fisher, and with talc. Bracelets are also made of lac by Muhammadan women.\n\n**Lasw\u00e1ri** (or N\u00e1sw\u00e1ri).\u2014Village in Alwar (Ulwar) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Lat. $27^\\circ 33' 30''$ N., long. $76^\\circ 54' 45''$ E.; situated 8 miles south-east of R\u00e1mgarh and about 20 miles south-east of Alwar city. Famous as the scene of the great battle of the 1st November 1803, which destroyed the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power in India. The battle is thus described by Marshman:\u2014\u2018He (Lord Lake) had received an unfounded report that the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 army was endeavouring to avoid him, and, with his usual impetuosity, started at midnight in search of it with his cavalry alone, leaving orders for the infantry to follow. He came up with the encampment of the enemy at daybreak on the 1st November, at the village of Lasw\u00e1ri, and found them, as usual, entrenched in a formidable position, with their guns drawn up in the front. The general led his cavalry up in person to the attack; a fearful discharge of grape and double-headed shot mowed down column after column, and rendered the fiery valour of the troops useless. To prevent their utter extinction, the general was obliged to withdraw them from the conflict, to await the arrival of the infantry, who had marched 65 miles in the preceding forty-eight hours, and 25 miles since midnight. After a brief rest and a hasty meal, they were launched on the enemy\u2019s guns and battalions. The engagement was the severest in which the Company\u2019s troops had ever been engaged, not excepting that of Assaye. Sindhia\u2019s Sepoys fought as natives had never fought before. They defended their position to the last extremity, contesting every point inch by inch, and refusing to give way while a single gun remained in their possession. But they were at length overpowered, and lost their ammunition and camp equipage, together with 71 pieces of cannon. It was even reported that one-half their number was left on the field, killed or wounded. On the British side, the casualties amounted to 824, one-fourth of which belonged to the 76th Regiment, which bore the brunt of the action.\u2019 [For fuller details of the battle, see the interesting account given in Appendix iv. pp. 302-309 of *The R\u00e1jput\u00e1na Gazetteer*, vol. iii. (Simla, 1880).]\n\n**L\u00e1thi.**\u2014Native State in the Gohelw\u00e1r pr\u00e1nt or division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency, lying between $21^\\circ 41'$ and $21^\\circ 45'$ $30''$ N. lat., and between $71^\\circ 23'$ to $71^\\circ 32'$ E. long. Population (1881)\n6804; area, 48 square miles; number of villages, 8. The territory is hilly in parts, and the soil black. The climate is hot and dry, and fever is the most prevalent disease. The usual cereals, sugar-cane and cotton, are grown. The nearest port is Bhaunagar. L\u00e1thi is one of the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r \u2018fourth-class\u2019 States. Its chiefs are descended from S\u00e1rangj\u00ed, second brother of the founder of the Bhaunagar line. One of the Th\u00e1kurs of L\u00e1thi wedded his daughter to D\u00e1m\u00e1ji G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, and gave the estate of Chabh\u00e1ria, now called D\u00e1mnagar, in dowry, being exempted from tribute in return. He now yearly offers a horse. In 1807, the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r became security for the Th\u00e1kur\u2019s engagements to keep order in his territory. The present (1882\u201383) chief is B\u00e1pubha, a Hindu of the Gohel R\u00e1jput caste. He administers his State in person, and enjoys an estimated gross yearly revenue of \u00a37311. He pays a tribute of \u00a3200, 14s. jointly to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda and the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh, and maintains a military force of 79 men. The family of the chief hold no sanad authorizing adoption. The succession follows the rule of primogeniture. There were in 1882\u201383, 4 schools, with 160 pupils. No transit dues are levied in the State.\n\nL\u00e1thi.\u2014Chief town of L\u00e1thi State, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 21\u00b0 43' 20\" N., long. 71\u00b0 28' 30\" E.

The tract is watered by the Seon\u00e1th and Mah\u00e1nadi. West of the latter river, the land is generally well cultivated, producing large quantities of rice. To the east, the country consists of low hills, covered with bamboos and thatching grass, whence most of the villages of the District are supplied. Along the extreme eastern boundary, there are fine s\u00e1l forests.\n\nLaur.\u2014The old name for one of the three Divisions of Sylhet District, Assam. The division of Gor or Sylhet proper was conquered by the Muhammadans in the 14th century, but Laur retained its independence until the time of the Mughal Emperor Akbar. The last Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Laur, Gobind, was summoned to Delhi, and there became a Musalm\u00e1n. His grandson, Abid Rez\u00e1, abandoned Laur, and built the town of Bani\u00e1chang in the beginning of the 18th century. It\nwas not till the rule of Al\u00ed Vard\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, Naw\u00e1b of Bengal, that the estate became subject to a money payment of land revenue.\n\n**L\u00e1wa.**\u2014Town in Tal\u00e1gang tahsil, Jehlam (Jhelum) District, Punjab. Situated near the western border of the District, a few miles north of the Salt Range and Mount Sukesar, in lat. $32^\\circ 41' 45''$ N., and long. $71^\\circ 58' 30''$ E. L\u00e1wa is a large Aw\u00e1n village, with numerous hamlets, but of no commercial importance, and its inhabitants are almost exclusively agriculturists.

The L\u00e1wa chiefship was originally granted by the Jaipur (Jeypore) family to a relative, and eventually fell to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 leader Am\u00edr Kh\u00e1n. In recent times the Th\u00e1kurs of L\u00e1wa have been dependent on the Chief of Tonk, but the connection was severed by the British Government in 1867.\n\n**L\u00e1w\u00e1r.**\u2014Town in Meerut (Merath) tahsil, Meerut District, North-Western Provinces; situated 12 miles north of Meerut city.

Sheo Singh, an early R\u00e1j\u00e1 of T\u00edrh\u00fat, is said to have lived near this tank; and a space of about 4 acres, covered with bricks and jungle, is pointed out as the site of his palace.\n\nLeiah.\u2014South-eastern tahsil of Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n District, Punjab, lying between 30\u00b0 35' 45\" and 31\u00b0 25' N. lat., and between 70\u00b0 49' and 71\u00b0 52' 30\" E. long.; comprising the southern portion of the sparsely-inhabited cis-Indus tract, which consists of two parts, the thal or prairie-like uplands, and the kachi or alluvial lands in the bed of the Indus lying to the east of the main stream. The former tract is very sandy, and has but little cultivation except in the immediate vicinity of the wells, of which, however, there are great numbers. The thal, though very sandy, affords, in good years, excellent pasturage for cattle and camels. The kachi tract lies on a much lower level than the thal, and its cultivation is entirely dependent on the inundation of the Indus, branches of which intersect it in every direction. The kachi is, on the whole, a pleasant country; about half its area is cultivated, the remainder being overgrown with tall munj grass, and near the river with low tamarisk jungle.\nArea of Leiah tahsil, 2428 square miles, with 103 towns and villages, 21,611 occupied houses, and 22,693 families.

Situated on the old left bank of the Indus, somewhat to the east of the present bed, in lat. 30\u00b0 57' 30\" N., and long. 70\u00b0 58' 20\" E. The town was founded probably during the 16th century by Kam\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, a Baluch of the Mahr\u00e1ni family of Dera Ghazi Kh\u00e1n. His descendants ruled the surrounding country for about 200 years, having their capital at Leiah, till they were supplanted by the Kalhora kings of Sind. On the establishment of Muhammad Kh\u00e1n Sadoz\u00e1\u00ed in 1792, Leiah gave place to Mankera as the capital of the new ruler. Under the Sikh Government, the town once more became the centre of administration for the neighbouring tract; and on the British occupation in 1849, it rose for a time to the rank of head-quarters of a District. In 1861, however, the District was broken up, and Leiah, together with Bhakkar, became a part of Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n. Population (1868) 5,446; (1881) 5,899, namely, Muhammadans, 2,913; and Hindus, 2,986. Number of houses, 1,490.

Hindus number 33,556; Muhammadans, 4632; and 'others,' 4875. The country is flat, and the soil, in some parts black and others red, is generally sandy. The Bhog\u00e1wo river flows through the State, but, like some of the smaller streams, it becomes brackish in the hot weather. The territory of Limri or Limbd\u00ed is peculiarly liable to inundations, and suffered severely from their devastations in the year 1878-79, the road between Limri and Wadhw\u00e1n having been breached in many places. As regards the relations of landlord and tenant, the State is said to be reverting, like other States in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, to the levying of rent in kind rather than in money. The climate of Limri, though hot, is healthy. The prevailing diseases are fever and bowel complaints. Cotton and grain are cultivated, and coarse cloth is manufactured. Before the opening of the Bhaunagar-Gondal Railway, the produce was exported chiefly from the port of Dholera.\n\nLimri is one of the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r 'second-class' States, the chief of which executed the usual engagements in 1807. The succession follows the rule of primogeniture; there is no sanad authorizing adoption. The present (1884) chief is Th\u00e1kur S\u00e1hib Jaswant Singhji Fatesinghji, a Hindu of the Jh\u00e1la R\u00e1jput caste. He has power to try his own subjects only for capital offences, without the express permission of the Political Agent; and he is entitled to a salute of 9 guns. He received his education at the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r College at R\u00e1jkot; and on 1st February 1876, on attaining his majority, he was permitted to assume full jurisdiction as a 'second-class' chief. Estimated gross revenue \u00a322,137; tribute of \u00a34553, 6s. is paid jointly to the British Government and to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh. The chief maintains a military force of 160 men. Works for irrigation are in course of construction. There were in 1882-83, 17 schools, with a total roll of 1317 pupils.

Area, 12,045 square miles. Population (1881) 1,609,244 persons. Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District forms the central and north-western portion of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Division. It is bounded on the north by Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh, Gay\u00e1, and Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d Districts, from which it is separated by the Son (Soane) river; on the north-west and west by M\u00edrz\u00e1pur District in the North-Western Provinces and by the Native States of Sarg\u00faj\u00e1, Jashpur, and G\u00e1ngpur; and on the south-east and east by the Districts of Singbh\u00fam and M\u00e1nbh\u00fam. A portion of the eastern boundary coincides with the course of the Subarnarekh\u00e1 river. The administrative head-quarters are at Ranchi.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 comprises three tracts of country, differing essentially in their physical conformation\u2014Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper, the Five Pargan\u00e1s, and the Sub-division of Pal\u00e1mau.\n\nChuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper, as distinguished from the administrative Division of that name, is an elevated table-land, forming the central and southern portion of Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District. To the west, this plateau rises and stretches away towards Central India, to meet the S\u00e1tpur\u00e1 mountains. Its average elevation is about 2000 feet. On the north, it is connected with the central plateau of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh by a narrow neck of high land passing through Tor\u00ed pargan\u00e1. The surface of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur plateau is undulating, and the slopes of the depressions lying between the ridges are cut into terraces covered with rice.\n\nThe tract commonly called the Five Pargan\u00e1s, consisting of pargan\u00e1s Silli, R\u00e1hi, Bundu, Baraud\u00e1, and T\u00e1nas, lies east of the central plateau, below the gh\u00e1ts, and in most respects resembles the adjoining District of M\u00e1nbh\u00fam. The southern portion of pargan\u00e1 Bassia, with the whole of pargan\u00e1 Biru on the south, and pargan\u00e1 Tori in the north of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper, also lie below the central plateau, at an average elevation of 1200 feet.\n\nPal\u00e1mau Sub-division, which forms the north-western portion of the District, consists on the east and south of spurs thrown off from the plateaux of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh and Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, while the remainder of the tract is a tangled mass of isolated peaks and long irregular stretches of broken hills. The general run of these hill ranges is from east to west, but the relations of the minor ridges are very involved. The average elevation of the country is about 1200 feet above sea-level, but some of the higher peaks rise to more than 3000 feet. The two highest peaks in the District are\u2014S\u00e1ru, 3615 feet, west of Ranchi; and Marang Baru, 3445 feet, north of Ranchi. The\nPal\u00e1mau Sub-division is wider and more rocky than Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper, and contains no level areas of any extent, except the valleys of the North Koel and Am\u00e1nat rivers, to which rice cultivation is confined.\n\nThe principal rivers of Lod\u00e1rdag\u00e1 are the Subarnarekha, and the North and South Koel. The main confluents of the Subarnarekh\u00e1 are the K\u00e1nch\u00ed and Karkari, both rising on the central plateau. The chief feeders of the North Koel are the Am\u00e1nat, which rises in Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh, and the Aurang\u00e1, a picturesque stream of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. The K\u00e1ru, the Deo, and many minor streams fall into the South Koel. The highest hills are\u2014in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, S\u00e1ru (3615 feet) and B\u00e1r\u00e1g\u00e1i or Marang Buru (3445 feet); and in Pal\u00e1mau, Bulbul on the south-eastern boundary (3329 feet), Bur\u00ed on the south-western boundary (3078 feet), and Kot\u00e1m (2791 feet). Throughout the District, the hills are, as a rule, covered with tree jungle or a scrubby undergrowth, consisting of wild plum or ber tree (Zizyphus Jujuba) and stunted pal\u00e1s (Butea frondosa).\n\nJungle Products.\u2014The entire surface of Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 was probably at one time overgrown with dense forest, but the forest area has been dwindling, owing to the spread of cultivation and the practice of girdling the sal tree for resin. Three different kinds of timber are exported from the Pal\u00e1mau forests. First, large sal timber is exported from the forests around Bar\u00e1saud, partly by land, and partly by water down the Koel; secondly, small timber averaging 2 feet in girth and from 12 to 15 feet in length is carted from the north-east of the District into Gay\u00e1; and thirdly, very large quantities of bamboos are cut in the forests around Bar\u00e1saud, and transported down the Koel to Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, Patn\u00e1, and Gay\u00e1 Districts. The chief jungle products are as follow:\u2014(1) The corollas of the mahu\u00e1 tree (Bassia latifolia), which are eaten by the poorer classes, and from which an intoxicating spirit is distilled; (2) the seeds of the sal tree, which are roasted, and either mixed with mahu\u00e1 flowers or eaten alone; (3) the berry of the j\u00e1mun tree (Eugenia Jambolana), eaten as food; (4) the bean of the karanja tree (Pongamia glabra); (5) lac; (6) tasar silk; (7) catechu; (8) resin; (9) honey; and (10) arrowroot. Throughout the Pal\u00e1mau Sub-division, the quantity of cleared and cultivated land bears a very small proportion to the uncleared waste; and the south and south-western portions form one vast pasture ground. A considerable number of cattle are bred on the spot; and during the dry months of the year, large herds are driven in to graze from the neighbouring Districts of Gay\u00e1 and Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nMinerals.\u2014Iron in a nodular form, and three varieties of iron-ore, are found in the District; lime and soapstone are obtained in small quantities; and copper has been found in several places in Pal\u00e1mau, though not in sufficient quantity to allow of profitable working. Gold\nis washed by the poorest classes from the sands of the rivers in the south of the District, especially in the valley of Sonapet, bordering on Singbh\u00fam. There is one important coal-bearing tract situated to the north of Daltonganj, known as the Daltonganj Coal-field. It covers an area of nearly 200 square miles, lying partly in the valley of the Koel river and partly in that of the Am\u00e1nat, and extending altogether a distance of 50 miles from east to west. A portion of the south Karanpura coal-field extends into pargan\u00e1 Tori.\n\nThe District contains two picturesque waterfalls, known as Hundrugh\u00e1gh and D\u00e1samgh\u00e1gh. The former is situated in pargan\u00e1 Jashpur, about 25 miles east-north-east of R\u00e1nch\u00ed, and is caused by the Subarnarekh\u00e1 river rushing down a rocky chasm, as it passes from the second to the lowest plateau in its course towards the Delta of Bengal. The measured height of the fall is 320 feet, but this does not represent a sheer drop, except in the rains. D\u00e1samgh\u00e1gh waterfall, about 22 miles to the south-east of R\u00e1nch\u00ed, is formed by the K\u00e1nchi river falling over a ledge of rock in a perpendicular descent of 114 feet.\n\nFere Natur\u00e6.\u2014The large sorts of game met with in Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District are the tiger, leopard, bear, wild boar, wolf, hyaena, antelope, spotted deer, ravine deer, s\u00e1mbhar, and nilg\u00e1i. A few bison are to be found in the south of Pal\u00e1mau, and packs of wild dogs are occasionally seen in the northern and western parts of that Sub-division. The small game comprise hares, quail, snipe, grey partridge, duck, teal, ortolan, plover, and pigeon. In Pal\u00e1mau are found, in addition to these, peafowl, jungle-fowl, black partridge, floriken, curlew, and heron. The superior sorts of fish are the mah\u00e1sir, several kinds of trout, the ruhi, k\u00e1tl\u00e1, puti\u00e1, garai, chalhaw\u00e1, etc.\n\nHistory.\u2014The only materials, even for conjecture, regarding the early history of the District are the legends of aboriginal races. From these, it would appear that while the country was still covered with unbroken forest, and retained its ancient name of Jh\u00e1rkhand, or \u2018the forest tract,\u2019 the Mundas, and subsequently the Ur\u00e1ons, effected a settlement on the central table-land. Although the two races did not intermarry, and in many respects remained distinct, they adopted a uniform system of government by parh\u00e1s, or village communes. The hilly country now comprised in the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Division remained independent, both in name and in fact, during the Muhammadan period, until the Mughal governors of Bengal and Behar failed in their attempts to push their conquests farther to the east, and therefore turned their arms towards the west and south.\n\nThe earliest Musalm\u00e1n inroads (circa 1616 A.D.) were directed against Kokrah or Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper, which was celebrated at the Delhi court for the diamonds found in its rivers. The Musalm\u00e1ns afterwards (1640\u201360) made several invasions into Pal\u00e1mau; and at the\nend of 1660 occurred the attack on Pal\u00e1mau fort, and its capture by D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n, which forms the subject of a large picture (30 feet by 12) preserved by D\u00e1\u00fad\u2019s descendants. This picture, which is of considerable interest, has been recently photographed, and is described in detail by Colonel Dalton in the Journal of the Asiatic Society for 1874. Colonel Dalton\u2019s description is quoted in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xvi. pp. 464-468.\n\nFrom the date of the capture of Pal\u00e1mau fort until 1722, the annals of Pal\u00e1mau are blank. In the latter year, the ruling R\u00e1j\u00e1, Ranjit R\u00e1i, was murdered, and Jaikissen R\u00e1i, descended from the younger son of a former R\u00e1j\u00e1, was placed upon the State cushion (g\u00e1di). A few years afterwards, Jaikissen was shot in a skirmish, and his family fled to Megr\u00e1 in Behar, and took refuge with one Udwant R\u00e1m, a k\u00e1n\u00edngo, who in 1770 took Gop\u00e1l R\u00e1i, grandson of the murdered R\u00e1j\u00e1, to Patn\u00e1, and presented him to Captain Carnac, the Government Agent, as the rightful heir to the Pal\u00e1mau R\u00e1j. Captain Carnac promised the assistance of the British Government, and, after defeating the troops of the ruling R\u00e1j\u00e1, gave a sanad for five years to Gop\u00e1l R\u00e1i and two of his cousins, and then left the country.\n\nPal\u00e1mau thus became part of the British District of R\u00e1mgarh. A year or two later, Gop\u00e1l R\u00e1i was sentenced to imprisonment at Patn\u00e1 for being concerned in the murder of the k\u00e1n\u00edngo, Udwant R\u00e1m, who had helped him to power. He died at Patn\u00e1 in 1784, and in the same year died Bassant R\u00e1i, who had succeeded to the g\u00e1di on his imprisonment. Chur\u00e1man R\u00e1i succeeded; but by 1813 he had become insolvent, and Pal\u00e1mau was sold for arrears of revenue and bought in by Government for the amount due. In 1816 the estate was granted to Fateh N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Singh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Deo in Gay\u00e1, for services rendered to the Government. But his management was so oppressive as to rouse the people into open rebellion; and in 1818, Government revoked the deed of grant, allowing the R\u00e1j\u00e1 a remission of \u00a3300 a year from the revenue of his Behar estates by way of compensation.\n\nUnder Government rule, Pal\u00e1mau remained quiet, and continued so during the outbreak of the Kols in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper in 1831, which was not quelled till March 1832. This outbreak arose from the oppression of the aboriginal population by the relations and followers of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper, who exercised no authority whatever in Pal\u00e1mau. An account of the causes which led to this insurrection, and of the measures taken to put it down, will be found in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xvi. pp. 451-454. Not before several villages had been plundered and burned, and many lives sacrificed to the enraged Kols, did the leaders surrender. The changes in administration which followed this insurrection will be found noticed\nin the article on Hazaribagh District. A rising of the Chero and Kharw\u00e1r tribes in 1832 was soon put down; and there were no further troubles until the Mutiny of 1857, when the Kharw\u00e1rs, headed by the Bhogt\u00e1s, rose against their Rajput landlords; and the mutineers of the R\u00e1mgarh Battalion, taking refuge in Pal\u00e1mau, made common cause with Nil\u00e1mbar and Pit\u00e1mbar Singh, two malcontent landholders. The 26th Madras Native Infantry, and a portion of the R\u00e1mgarh Battalion which had remained loyal, defeated the insurgents at the Satbarw\u00e1 forts. Nil\u00e1mbar and Pit\u00e1mbar Singh were taken prisoners and hanged.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The first attempt at an enumeration of the people of Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 was made at the time of the Topographical Survey of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper in 1868. One hundred and twenty-eight houses, in different villages, and belonging to men of different castes, were taken at random, and the average number of persons per house thus ascertained was multiplied by the total number of houses in the District. The result arrived at was a population of 1,412,956, the area of the District at that time being 11,404 square miles. According to an experimental Census in 1869, the population was returned at 1,396,474 persons.\n\nA regular Census was taken for the first time in 1871-72. Owing to the sparseness and ignorance of the population, no attempt at a simultaneous enumeration was made; the work was done gradually by a special salaried agency. This Census disclosed a total population, on the area of the present District of 12,045 square miles, of 1,237,123 persons, inhabiting 6,486 villages and 249,843 houses. In 1881, a simultaneous Census taken over the whole District returned the population at 1,609,244, showing an apparent increase over the enumeration of 1872 of 372,121, or 30.08 per cent., in nine years. This increase, however, is only apparent, and is due to the defective enumeration of 1872, which was only approximate, and partook rather of the character of a survey of the population than of a systematic Census. Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 is one of the great recruiting Districts for coolie emigrants to other parts of India and to the West Indies and Mauritius, and immigration into it from outside is almost nil. It is considered, therefore, that about 15 per cent. of the apparent increase is due to imperfect enumeration in 1872.\n\nThe results of the more careful and simultaneous Census of 1881 may be summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 12,045 square miles, with 4 towns, 12,126 villages, and 289,886 occupied houses. Total population, 1,609,244, namely, males 796,657, and females 812,587; proportion of males, 49.5 per cent. Average density of population, 133.6 persons per square mile; number of towns or villages, 1.01 per square mile; persons per town or village, 133; houses per square mile, 24.49; inmates per house, 5.55. Classified according to age, there are,\nunder 15 years of age\u2014males 375,263, females 356,310; total children, 731,573, or 45\u00b75 per cent. of the population: 15 years of age and upwards\u2014males 421,394, females 456,277; total adults, 877,671, or 54\u00b75 per cent. The large proportion of children is said to be due to the fact that the aboriginal races are unusually prolific. The returns of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Division, and of the District of the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, display a proportion of children to the total population bearing a direct ratio to the relative strength of the aboriginal element. Classified according to religion, the Census Report returned the population as follows:\u2014Hindus, 868,842; Muhammadans, 77,403; Christians, 36,281; Jains, 56; Buddhist, 1; tribes professing aboriginal religions, 626,661.\n\nThe aboriginal Kols form the majority of the population, those still professing their primitive faiths, as apart from those who have accepted some form of Hinduism, or have been converted to Christianity, being returned at 591,858. The word Kol is popularly employed in a vague way as including not only the Mundas of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper and the Larkas or Hos of Singbh\u00fam, but all Kolarian aborigines wherever found. For a detailed account of these tribes, their origin, customs, etc., the reader is referred to Colonel Dalton\u2019s valuable Ethnology of Bengal, quoted at considerable length in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xvi. pp. 266\u2013279, and vol. xvii. pp. 36\u201359. Colonel Dalton thinks there can be no doubt of the remote north-eastern origin of the Kolarian tribes, but little is to be found in their folk-lore to throw light on the early history of the race. The families that rank highest among them have lost their native traditions in the hazy fables invented for them by the Hindus. The lower classes, as a rule, declare themselves to be autochthones; and even the chiefs found their claims to be of noble birth on miracles that took place in the country which they call their fatherland. Besides the Kols, the Census Report includes 34,803 other aboriginal tribes still outside the pale of Hinduism. The Ur\u00e1ons or Or\u00e1ons are, excluding the semi-Hinduized aborigines, the strongest Dravidian tribe in Bengal. They are the people known in the plains as Dh\u00e1ngars (hillmen), and are found in great numbers throughout the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Division. Although they are not returned separately in the Census Report, they are probably included in the \u2018other aborigines\u2019 mentioned above. According to Colonel Dalton, the tribe has gradually migrated from the western coast of India\u2014probably from Gujar\u00e1t or the Konkan. A detailed account of the Ur\u00e1ons will be found in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xvi. pp. 278\u2013294. The most numerous of the semi-Hinduized aboriginal tribes in Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 are\u2014the Bhuiy\u00e1s, of whom there are 58,419; the Kharw\u00e1rs, 77,341; the Dos\u00e1dhs, 37,034; and Gonds, 1389, besides 58,452\n'others.' The foregoing figures give a total aboriginal population (by race as apart from religion) of 859,296, or 53.4 per cent. of the total District population.\n\nOf high-caste Hindus, the Br\u00e1hmans number 42,439; R\u00e1jputs, 47,471; B\u00e1bhans, a class of agricultural Br\u00e1hmans, who are supposed to have lapsed from ceremonial purity, 9406; K\u00e1yasths, 6690; and Baniy\u00e1s, 17,556. Of lower classes or S\u00fadra castes, the most numerous are\u2014the Go\u00e1l\u00e1s or Ah\u00edrs, a pastoral caste, 78,677; the Kurmis, the great agricultural caste of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Division, 43,766; Kah\u00e1rs (domestic servants and water-carriers), 34,700; K\u00e1m\u00e1rs (blacksmiths), 34,341; Tel\u00eds (oilmen), 32,835; Cham\u00e1rs (skinners and workers in leather), 27,276; Koer\u00eds (cultivators), 23,540; Kumbh\u00e1rs (potters), 19,568; N\u00e1pits (barbers), 17,439; Barh\u00e1\u00eds (carpenters), 11,447; Dhobis (washermen), 11,021; and Mallahs (boatmen), 10,924.\n\nThe Native Christian population is much larger in Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 than in any other Bengal District. The total number of Christians in 1881 was\u2014males 18,205, and females 18,076; total, 36,281, or 2.2 per cent. of the total population. This includes Europeans, Eurasians, etc., to the number of 289, leaving a balance of 35,992 for the native Christians. Of these, about three-fourths are baptized converts, and the remainder, though not baptized, are 'inquirers,' and call themselves Christians. Nearly all the Christians are Mundas or Ur\u00e1ons, and belong to the agricultural classes. Most of them are poor, but they possess considerable influence notwithstanding, and are said to be rising in public esteem. The District has been, since the founding of the original Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Mission in 1844 by the Bavarian Gossner, the most successful field of missionary labour in Bengal, and the great majority of the Christian population (23,245) belong to the Lutheran Church. There are two missions at work in the District, one sent out from Germany and the other from England. These two bodies, styled the German Lutheran Evangelical Mission, and the Church of England Mission, now work side by side with much success. A detailed account of the separate development of the two missions, together with an inquiry into the various causes affecting the progress of Christianity in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur generally, will be found in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xvi. pp. 423-444.\n\nTown and Rural Population.\u2014The population of Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 is almost wholly rural. The civil station of Ranchi, itself little more than a collection of villages, has (1881), including the cantonment of Doranda, lying to the south of the town, and separated from it by a small stream, a population of 18,443 inhabitants. The other towns in the District deserving notice are\u2014Daltonganj, administrative headquarters of the Pal\u00e1mau Sub-division (population 7440); Garwa, on the north Koel river, the chief trading centre of Pal\u00e1mau Sub-division\n(population 6043); LOHARDAGA, 45 miles west of R\u00e1nch\u00ed town, till 1840 the administrative head-quarters of the District (population 3461); and Chuti\u00e1 village, 2 miles east of R\u00e1nch\u00ed (whence the name Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur). R\u00e1nch\u00ed is a municipality; while Dorand\u00e1, Garw\u00e1, and Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 have been formed into chauk\u00edd\u00e1r\u00ed or police unions.\n\nAt Jagann\u00e1thpur village, 3 miles south-west of R\u00e1nch\u00ed, stands on a high rock the largest temple in the District, built on a plan resembling that of the great temple at Pur\u00ed. Do\u00eds\u00e1 is the site of a ruined palace once inhabited by the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur; and at the small village of Tilm\u00ed are the remains of a ruined fortress, formerly the seat of the Th\u00e1kurs, a subordinate branch of the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur family. Chokahatu, a village in the south-east of the District, is interesting as containing a large burial-ground still used by the Mundas. Annual fairs are held at Chuti\u00e1 and Daltonganj.\n\nThe Census Report of 1881 thus classifies the villages and towns. Of the 12,130 villages in the District, no less than 9895 have less than two hundred inhabitants; 1932 from two to five hundred; 261 from five hundred to a thousand; 31 from one to two thousand; and 11 upwards of two thousand inhabitants.\n\nWith regard to occupation, the male population are divided into the following six classes:\u2014(1) Professional class, including all Government servants, civil and military, and the learned professions, 4970; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 24,293; (3) commercial class, including bankers, traders, carriers, etc., 11,098; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 295,046; (5) manufacturing and industrial class, including artisans, 52,816; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified or no occupation, 408,434.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The system of agriculture followed in Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District is determined by the physical conformation of the country, particularly in the case of rice, which forms the principal product of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper, while in Pal\u00e1mau its cultivation is confined to the more fertile parts of the Koel and Am\u00e1nat valleys.\n\nThe rice crops of the District are divided into three classes\u2014viz., tew\u00e1n, or lowland rice, comprising both an early and an autumn crop; gor\u00e1, or upland rice; and don, which includes two autumn crops, and the great winter rice crop of the year. A more general and more correct classification of the crops will be found in the article on Hazaribagh District. The method of rice cultivation described in that article is also followed in Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1; but rice of the highest quality is not grown to any extent in this District, although the soil is so well suited for the finest varieties that zamind\u00e1rs, who\ncultivate both here and in Beh\u00e1r, import rice from Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur for their own consumption in preference to that of Behar.\n\nOther crops of Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 are wheat, barley, Indian corn, millets, peas, gram, mustard, and other oil-seeds, p\u00e1n, cotton, and tobacco. Cotton, sown in July and cut in November, and til (Sesamum orientale) form the staple export crops of the Pal\u00e1mau Sub-division; the area under the former crop in 1870 was estimated at 9600 acres\u2014total yield, 949 tons of raw cotton. Tobacco, which is confined to Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper, covers only about 200 acres, the maximum out-turn, under favourable circumstances, being 28\u00bd cwts. an acre. Opium cultivation was introduced into Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper in 1869. In that year, the area cultivated was 387 acres, and the out-turn was 60 cwts. By 1873\u201374, the area under opium had risen to 1848 acres, and the out-turn to 245 cwts. The opium agency, however, was abolished in 1878. Tea cultivation has received a considerable impetus of late years. In 1870 there were but two small tea plantations in the District. By 1883 the number of gardens had increased to 30, with a total area of 1407 acres under mature and 1345 acres under immature plant; the total out-turn of leaf in the year being 249,364 lbs., or an average of 156 lbs. per acre of mature plants.\n\nCondition of the Peasantry.\u2014In Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper, a farm of upwards of 33 acres, containing 22 acres of low land and 11 acres of upland, is considered a very large holding for a single husbandman; and anything below 3\u00bd acres, consisting of 1\u00bd acres low land and 1\u00bd acres upland, a very small one. A farm of 13 acres, of which 8 acres are low land and 5 acres upland, is a fair-sized comfortable holding for the support of a cultivator and his family. But in Pal\u00e1mau the proportion of upland cultivated is far larger than in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper; and there, a farm consisting of 13 acres of low land and 26 acres of high land is considered a large one; and a holding of one-third of an acre of low land and 3\u00bd acres of upland a very small one. A fair-sized comfortable holding in Pal\u00e1mau is about 4 acres of low land, with from 8 to 10 acres of upland. A cultivator with a middling-sized household can support himself and his family, from the proceeds of a holding of 13 acres, on the same scale as a man drawing Rs. 8 or 16s. a month in money wages. In Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper, an ordinary pair of bullocks can plough from 5 to 7 acres of land; and in Pal\u00e1mau 5 acres. In Pal\u00e1mau a cultivator who has no plough-bullocks of his own, hires them on what is called the bh\u00faa system, that is, for every bullock hired, the cultivator has to deliver 2 maunds, or 1\u00bd cwts., at each of the three harvests. If he fails to pay, the value of the grain is converted into money, and the transaction treated as a loan. Throughout Pal\u00e1mau, the cultivators, especially those belonging to aboriginal races, are hopelessly in debt to the rural\nmoney-lenders (mah\u00e1jan or s\u00e1hu). In Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper, it may be inferred from the general consumption of fermented liquors, and the large sums spent in litigation by the agricultural classes, that their material condition is at present fairly prosperous. Wages and prices have risen considerably of late years throughout the District. Coolies and day-labourers who in 1856 received 1\u00bdd., now earn from 1\u00bed. to 2\u00bcd.; and smiths, bricklayers, and carpenters, whose wage in 1856 was 3d. to 4\u00bdd., obtain 4\u00bdd. to 6d., or even 7\u00bdd. In 1870, the price of common rice was 4s. 2d. per cwt., as against 2s. 8d. in 1859; and the price of the best cleaned rice was in 1870, 5s. 9d. per cwt., as against 3s. 9d. in 1859. In 1883, the average price of common rice was 5s. 6d. per cwt., and of wheat, 7s. 4d. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Mildew and a variety of blights caused by insects and worms occasionally attack the crops, and failure in the local rainfall sometimes causes drought; which, however, seldom affects any considerable area. Such partial failures are more common in Pal\u00e1mau than in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper. Floods are rendered almost impossible, except for a very short time, and within the narrowest limits, by the physical conformation of the country, and the extremely rapid discharge of surface drainage. The great famine of 1866 did not seriously affect the District. The highest prices reached were\u2014for best rice, 11s. 6d. per cwt., and for coarse rice, 10s. 6d. per cwt. If in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper the autumn crop were to fail, and the price of rice were to rise to 6s. 10d. a cwt. immediately after the winter crop was off the ground, there would be reason to fear that the price would rise to 13s. 8d. a cwt. in March or April, rendering relief operations necessary.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The principal seats of trade in Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 are R\u00e1nch\u00ed, Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 town, P\u00e1lkot, Gov\u00edndpur, B\u00fand\u00fa, Garw\u00e1, Nagar, Unt\u00e1ri, S\u00e1tbarwa, and Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj. Markets are held once or twice a week according to the importance of the neighbourhood supplied. The principal trading place in the District is Garw\u00e1 in Pal\u00e1mau, which forms the distributing centre for the surplus produce of great part of Sarg\u00faj\u00e1, of the Tributary States farther west, and of Pal\u00e1mau Sub-division itself. The Garw\u00e1 market is held during the dry season in the sandy bed of the North Koel river, and is perhaps the largest in the Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur Division. Stick-lac, resin, catechu, cocoons of tas\u00e1r silk, hides, oil-seeds, gh\u00ed, cotton, and iron are there collected for exportation; rice and other food-grains, brass vessels, piece-goods, blankets, broad cloth, silk, salt, tobacco, spices, drugs, and beads are brought to market for local consumption. A large amount of business is done by travelling merchants, who buy up the produce from the cultivators. Few manufactures of importance are carried on in the District. Shell-lac is manufactured in considerable quantities, a factory at R\u00e1nch\u00ed turning out on an average\n292 tons of the article annually. There are also two factories at B\u00fand\u00fa. The manufacture of lac-dye which was formerly carried on to a considerable extent, has now ceased, the natural product being completely supplanted by aniline dyes. Inferior articles of brass and iron work, coarse cloth, rough blankets, mats, baskets, rope, and rude pottery utensils are also made. The total length of roads in the District is 1024 miles, of which 56 miles are maintained from Provincial funds, at a cost of \u00a3394, and 968 miles are maintained from the District road cess funds at a cost of \u00a32038.\n\nAdministration.\u2014No returns are available of the revenue and expenditure previous to 1858-59. In that year, the revenue of the District, which then contained the same area as at present, with the exception of two parganas recently transferred from Gay\u00e1, amounted to \u00a313,681, and the civil expenditure to \u00a315,440. This excess of expenditure over income was, however, quite abnormal, being caused by payments (amounting to \u00a34059) made on account of the Mutiny. In 1870-71, the net revenue amounted to \u00a329,900, and the total expenditure to \u00a322,563. In 1883-84, the total of six principal items of District revenue, imperial, local, and municipal, was returned at \u00a360,035, made up as follows:\u2014Land revenue, \u00a311,512; excise, \u00a329,694; stamps, \u00a39522; registration, \u00a3772; road cess, \u00a37375; municipal taxes, \u00a31160. Total civil expenditure, including police, \u00a325,674. The expansion of revenue is due for the most part to the re-settlement of Pal\u00e1mau at enhanced rates, and to an increase under excise and stamps. The land-tax forms a smaller proportion of the revenue of the District than in Bengal generally. In 1858-59 it amounted to \u00a34474, or only one-third of the entire revenue of the District; by 1870-71 it had risen to \u00a37067, but formed a still smaller proportion of the entire revenue, while in 1883-84 it was \u00a311,512, or only one-fifth.\n\nThere were in 1860-61, 5 magisterial and 5 civil and revenue courts in Loh\u00e1rd\u00e1g\u00e1; in 1883 the number had increased to 10 magisterial and 7 civil and revenue courts. The number of covenanted European officers at work in the District in 1860-61 was three, and in 1883, two. For police purposes, the District is divided into 21 th\u00e1n\u00e1s (police circles), with 25 outposts. The District regular police force, including municipal and town police, numbered 501 men of all ranks, in 1883, maintained at a total cost of \u00a39087. There is also a rural police or village watch of 3297 men, maintained by the landlords and villagers at an estimated cost, including rent-free service lands, of \u00a38600. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property consisted in 1883 of 3798 officers and men, giving 1 man to every 3'2 square miles of the area or to every 424 persons of the population. The estimated total cost was \u00a317,687, equal to a charge of \u00a31, 9s. 4\u00bdd. per square mile, and about\nper head of population. The number of convicted prisoners confined in the two jails of the District in 1881 was 659; number discharged, 702; daily average prison population, 182, of whom 5 were females. The Reports of the Director of Public Instruction show that in 1856-57, and again in 1860-61, there was only one Government inspected school in Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1. By 1870-71 the number of Government and aided schools had increased to 7, with 620 pupils; and in 1872-73, owing to the extension of the grant-in-aid system to primary schools, the number of Government and aided schools was 178, attended by 4553 pupils. Since then, education has made rapid progress, and the number of Government aided and inspected schools in 1882-83 was 335, with 10,314 pupils, being 6\u00b74 pupils to every 1000 of the population. The District is divided for administrative purposes into 2 Sub-divisions, and for fiscal purposes into 44 pargan\u00e1s.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of the table-land of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur proper is said to be superior to that of any other part of India, except the lower ranges of the Him\u00e1layas. The hot weather extends over almost six weeks, commencing about the 20th April, and is never really oppressive. The rainy season lasts from the middle of June to about the first week in October, but it is not very regular. The principal diseases of the District are malarious fever and rheumatism of a severe type. Small-pox has occasionally appeared in an epidemic form, but no serious outbreak is recorded. There are three charitable dispensaries\u2014at R\u00e1nch\u00ed, Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1, and Daltonganj, which afforded medical relief in 1883 to 239 in-door and 5678 out-door patients. The total number of registered deaths in the District in 1883 was 26,701, being at the rate of 16\u00b76 per thousand.

Area, 7804 square miles; villages, 9271; houses, 207,632. Population (1881), males 556,372, and females 568,050; total, 1,124,422. Hindus numbered 459,284; Muhammadans, 34,307; Christians, 36,263; Buddhist, 1; Jains, 56; Sant\u00e1ls, 310; Kols, 587,194; and other aboriginal tribes, 7007. Number of persons per square mile, 144; villages per square mile, 1\u00b719; persons per village, 121; houses per square mile, 27; persons per house, 5\u00b74.\nThis Sub-division comprises the 13 police circles of B\u00e1humat, Barw\u00e1, Bassi\u00e1, B\u00edf\u00fa, Chori\u00e1, Korambe, Lodhm\u00e1, Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1, P\u00e1lkot, R\u00e1nch\u00ed, Silli, Tam\u00e1r and Torpa. In 1883 it contained 4 civil courts, exclusive of the court of the Judicial Commissioner, 8 criminal courts, a regular police force of 331 men, and a village watch of 2276 men.\n\n**Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1.** \u2014 Town and municipality in Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District, B\u00e9nagal, and, until 1840, the administrative head-quarters of the District; situated in lat. $23\u00b0 25' 48\"$ N., and long. $84\u00b0 43' 16\"$ E., 45 miles to the west of Ranch\u00ed, the present head-quarters station. Population (1881) 3461, namely, males 1721, and females 1740. Municipal revenue in 1882, \u00a3145. Important market.\n\n**Loh\u00e1rg\u00e1on.** \u2014 Village in Ajaigarh State, Bundelkhand, North-Western Provinces. Lat. $24\u00b0 29' 30\"$ N., long. $80\u00b0 22' 25\"$ E.; situated on the route from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d to S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor), 198 miles south-west of the first-named town; lies in a depression between the Panna and Bandair Hills. Formerly contained a British military station, now abandoned. Population (1881) 384. Elevation above sea-level, 1260 feet.\n\n**Loh\u00e1rinaig.** \u2014 Waterfall in Garhw\u00e1l State, North-Western Provinces consisting of a series of cataracts on the river Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed. A fair road runs along the bank of the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed river, which is crossed by wire-rope suspension bridges in six places within 10 miles below the Loh\u00e1rinaig rapids. Elevation above sea, 7389 feet. Lat. $30\u00b0 57'$ N., long. $78\u00b0 44'$ E.\n\n**Loh\u00e1ru.** \u2014 One of the Native States under the Political Superintendence of the Commissioner of the Hiss\u00e1r Division and the Government of the Punjab, lying between $28\u00b0 21' 30\"$ and $28\u00b0 45'$ N. lat., and between $75\u00b0 40'$ and $75\u00b0 57'$ E. long. The principal town, Loh\u00e1ru, is situated in lat. $28\u00b0 24'$ N., and long. $75\u00b0 52'$ E.\n\nThe founder of the State was Ahmad Baksh Kh\u00e1n, a Mughal, who was employed by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Alwar (Ulwur), in negotiations with Lord Lake in 1806. In recognition of his services, he received Loh\u00e1ru in perpetuity from the R\u00e1j\u00e1, and the pargan\u00e1 (District) of Firozpur (Ferozepore) from Lord Lake on condition of fidelity and military service. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Shams-ud-d\u00edn Khan, who was executed at Delhi for compassing the murder of Mr. Fraser, the Resident, in 1835. The Firozpur pargan\u00e1 was confiscated, but the Loh\u00e1ru estate was made over to Am\u00edn-ud-d\u00edn Kh\u00e1n and Zia-ud-d\u00edn Kh\u00e1n, the two brothers of Shams-ud-d\u00edn. The two chiefs remained in Delhi during the siege in 1857, and, after the capture, they were placed under surveillance, but were eventually released and restored to their position. Am\u00edn-ud-d\u00edn Kh\u00e1n died in 1869, and was succeeded by his son Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, the present Naw\u00e1b of Loh\u00e1ru, who was born about 1833. By an arrangement of long standing, the younger chief has no\nshare in the management of the State, but has a fixed allowance of \u00a31800 per annum assigned to him. The title of Naw\u00e1b was granted to Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn in 1874, on condition of faithful allegiance to the British Government. He has also received a sanad of adoption. Recently, the Naw\u00e1b having fallen into embarrassed circumstances, arrangements were made to discharge his debts by a loan from Government, repayable in twelve years. During this period, the Naw\u00e1b has resigned the management of the State, which has been placed in the hands of his son, he himself receiving the fixed allowance assigned to the younger chief of the State. Area, 285 square miles, with 54 villages, 1617 houses, and 2500 families. Population (1881) 13,754, namely, males 7539, and females 6215. Classified according to religion, the population consists of\u2014Hindus, 12,225; Muhammadans, 1517; and Jains, 12. Estimated revenue of the State, \u00a36900. The chief is bound to furnish a contingent of 200 horse when required. The town of Loh\u00e1ru contains a population (1881) of 2038, namely, 1251 Hindus, 777 Muhammadans, and 10 Jains, residing in 239 houses. The Naw\u00e1b now resides at Farukhnagar in Gurgaon District. Post-office.\n\n**Lohgarh.**\u2014Fort near the top of the Bhor Pass, Poona District, Bombay Presidency; situated about 4 miles south-west of Khand\u00e1la. Seized in 1713 by K\u00e1nhoj\u00ed Angria, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 pirate. Subsequently, during British operations against the last Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Peshw\u00e1 B\u00e1ji R\u00e1o in 1818, Lohgarh was occupied by Lieutenant-Colonel Prother. Till as late as 1845, the fort was garrisoned by a British commandant and a few troops.\n\n**Lohit.**\u2014Important branch of the Brahmaputra river in Assam, which for a long distance forms the boundary between the Districts of Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r and Lakhimpur. After a winding course of about 70 miles, generally in a south-westerly direction, it rejoins the parent stream near the confluence of the Dhaneswar\u00ed (Dhansiri). The large alluvial island thus formed is called the Majuli Char. It covers an area of 310,215 acres, lying wholly within the jurisdiction of Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r. On its right or north bank the Lohit receives the waters of the Subansir\u00ed river.\n\n**Loisin.**\u2014Estate or zamind\u00e1ri in Sambalpur District, Central Provinces; 20 miles south-south-east of Sambalpur town. Population (1881) 2412, nearly all Gonds and Kandhs, residing in 26 villages; area, 60 square miles, of which only a small part is cultivated, nearly the whole estate consisting of a thick forest of s\u00e1l and s\u00e1j. During the Mutiny of 1857, the inhabitants, influenced by the rebel Surendra S\u00e1, did much mischief on the high-road from Cuttack, which runs through the estate; and Mudd\u00fa, the chief's brother, was hanged for the murder of Dr. Moore. Chandru, the chief, was restored after the amnesty.\n\n**Lon\u00e1r.**\u2014Town in Buld\u00e1na District, Berar. Lat. 19\u00b0 58' 50\" N.,\nlong. $76^\\circ 33'$ E. Population (1881) 2604, the majority of whom are Brahmins. A place of great antiquity, standing on a hill amidst undulating high lands, among which lies the salt lake of Lon\u00e1r, the fabled den of the demon-giant Lonas\u00far, who was overcome in single combat by an incarnation of Vishnu. The god assumed the form of a beautiful youth, and, with the aid of the giant's two sisters, discovered his subterranean abode. With a single touch of his toe, he threw off the lid of the den, and found the giant sleeping on his couch. A hill near Dh\u00e1kefal, about 36 miles south-west of Lon\u00e1r, is said to be the lid of the lake thrown off by Vishnu, and to coincide in shape and size with the top of the lake. Lonas\u00far was buried in the den or hollow now occupied by the great lake, whose water is supposed to be the giant's blood. Lon\u00e1r has ever since been held in great veneration.\n\nThe view of the lake is very striking. It is surrounded by a circular ridge of hills about 400 feet high, among which are several old temples and ruins of other monuments. From a crevice on the southern ridge flows an ample spring of sweet water, with a fine temple at the fountainhead. The top circumference of the hollow occupied by the lake is about 5 miles, and the cavity presents the appearance of an enormous volcanic crater. The country around is of tabular or nodular basalt. The sides of this great bowl rise abruptly at an angle of $75^\\circ$ to $80^\\circ$, the circumference of the lake itself at their bases being about 3 miles. These slopes are covered with jungle interspersed with teak; at their feet is a belt of large trees, about 300 yards broad, encircling the basin. This belt is formed of concentric rings of tamarind and babul.\n\nA muddy space, several hundred yards broad, white and slimy, and devoid of all vegetation, surrounds the lake; and is in the rainy season covered with water. The specific gravity of the water is $1027.65$. When in the dry weather evaporation reduces the level of the lake, large quantities of salts are collected, which by analysis (Malcolmson, 1837) gave in 100 parts\u2014carbonic acid, 38; soda, 40.9; water, 20.6; insoluble matter, 0.5; and a trace of sulphate. The salt is chiefly used for the manufacture of country soap, and is exported to considerable distances. It is now proposed to farm the products of the lake, leasing the right to collect the salt for a term of years.\n\nLon\u00e1ra.\u2014Town in Hardoi District, Oudh; 10 miles north-west of Sandil\u00e1. Population (1869) 2947; (1881) 1191, residing in 215 mud houses. Only noticeable as being the first seat of the Nikumbhs when, 300 years ago, they moved southwards from Muhamdi and drove out the Kamang\u00e1rs; and still in their possession.\n\nLonaul\u00ed.\u2014Town, municipality, and railway station in Poona District, Bombay Presidency; situated about 40 miles north-west of Poona city, at the top of the Bhor Pass. Lonaul\u00ed forms an important point on the south-east extension of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Popula-\ntion (1881) 3334. A railway reservoir, about 2 miles to the south of the town, affords a fair supply of drinking water. Close to the town is a wood of fine trees, covering an area of about 56 acres. The municipality, established in 1877, had in 1882-83 an income of \u00a3100; incidence of municipal taxation, 3\u00bdd. per head. Lonauli contains a post-office, locomotive works, Protestant and Roman Catholic chapels, railway school, masonic lodge, and co-operative store.\n\nLoni.\u2014Decayed town in Ghaziabad tahsil, Meerut (Merath) District, North-Western Provinces. Distant from Meerut city 29 miles south-west, from Delhi 7 miles north-east. The population, which in 1872 was returned at 4085, had by 1881 dwindled to 2529, namely, Muhammadans, 1505; Hindus, 1020; and Christians, 4. Ruined fort, built by Prithwi-r\u00e1j, the Chauh\u00e1n ruler of Delhi. The town was formerly a hunting residence of the Mughal Emperors. About 1789, Muhammad Sh\u00e1h built a grove and tank, to water which the Eastern Jumna Canal was first constructed, though never actually used. At Uldipur, Zin\u00e1t Mahal, wife of Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, planted another grove, enclosed by walls and gates, and containing a scarlet-domed b\u00e1rad\u00e1ri. Numerous other relics exist of the Mughal dynasty, confiscated after the Mutiny, and now for the most part in ruins. Police station, post-office.\n\nLorm\u00ed (Lurmi).\u2014Valuable estate in Mungeli tahsil, Bil\u00e1spur District, Central Provinces, owned by a Bair\u00e1g\u00ed, to whose predecessor it was granted in 1830. Area, 92 square miles, of which rather more than half is cultivated, and nearly all cultivable.\n\nLosar.\u2014The highest inhabited village in Spiti, Kangra District, Punjab, consisting of sixteen households. Lat. 32\u00b0 28' N., long. 77\u00b0 46' E.; elevation above sea-level, about 13,400 feet.\n\nLovedale.\u2014Hill station in the Nilgiri District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 11\u00b0 22' 40\" N., long. 76\u00b0 44' 30\" E. The Lawrence Asylum is situated here.\u2014See Utakamand.\n\nLow\u00e1.\u2014Town in Unao District, Oudh; situated on the Sai river, 16 miles north-east of P\u00farwa, and 36 from Unao town. Lat. 26\u00b0 29' N., long. 81\u00b0 1' E. Population (1869) 3318; (1881) 3192, namely, 3135 Hindus and 57 Muhammadans.\n\nLow\u00e1ghar.\u2014Mountain range in Bannu District, Punjab.\u2014See Maidani.\n\nLuckeeserai (Lakh\u00ed-sar\u00e1i).\u2014Railway station in Monghyr District, Bengal, at the junction of the 'chord' and 'loop' lines of the East India Railway; 262 miles from Calcutta by the former route. A broad, handsome bridge here crosses the Keul river, on the west bank of which Luckeeserai stands. Of growing importance as a railway junction.\n\nLucknow (Lakhnau).\u2014Division or Commissionership in Oudh, under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western\nProvinces; lying between 26\u00b0 6' and 27\u00b0 21' 5\" N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 7' and 81\u00b0 56' E. long. It forms the south-east Division of the Province of Oudh, and comprises the 3 Districts of Lucknow, Unao, and Bara Banki, each of which see separately. It is bounded on the north by Hardoi and Sitapur Districts; on the east by Bahraich and Gonda Districts; on the south by Faizabad (Fyzabad), Sult\u00e1npur, and R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli Districts; and on the west by the Ganges, separating it from the North-Western Provinces Districts of Fatehpur and Cawnpur. Area, 4504.5 square miles, containing 18 towns and 4676 villages, with 479,780 houses. Total population in 1869, 2,837,580, namely, males 1,466,831, and females 1,370,749. Total population (1881) 2,622,681, namely, males 1,350,053, and females 1,272,628. The decrease of population during the twelve years ending 1881 was, therefore, 214,899, or 7.6 per cent. The decrease varies from 4.9 per cent. in Unao to 8.5 per cent. in Bara Banki, and 10.5 per cent. in Lucknow. These Districts formed part of the tract which suffered from the drought of 1877-78, and the terrible fever of the following year. The District officers concur in ascribing the diminution to these disastrous years, and they show the rate of decrease to be highest in those parganas where the people suffered most.\n\nClassified according to religion, the Census of 1881 returned the population as follows:\u2014Hindus, 2,225,508, or 84.8 per cent.; Muhammadans, 389,154, or 14.8 per cent.; Sikhs, 282; Christians, 6407, mainly consisting of the Lucknow garrison of European troops; Jains, 1301; Parsis, 19; and Jews, 10. Among the higher castes, Br\u00e1hmans number 259,100, constituting the second most numerous caste in the Division; and Rajputs, 141,512; the two castes aggregating 400,612, or 15.3 per cent. of the total population. The Baniyas or trading class number 49,868; and the K\u00e1yasths, or writer caste, who form the bulk of the native officials, 39,410. Of the lower or S\u00fadra castes, the most important are\u2014Ahirs, the most numerous caste in the Division, 271,251; Chamars, 211,385; Kurmis, 184,747; Lodhis, 157,891; Kachhis, 76,412; Koris, 64,446; Kah\u00e1rs, 46,274; Gad\u00e1rias, 45,966; Nais, 44,541; Telis, 42,581; Barhais, 40,751; Dhab\u00eds, 37,112; Bhurijs, 30,961; Kumbh\u00e1rs, 26,424; Loh\u00e1rs, 23,944; Tambul\u00eds, 20,463. The old aboriginal tribe of P\u00e1s\u00eds are returned at 227,695 in number, and are included in the Census Report among the Hindus. The ancient dominant tribe of Bhars, who ruled the country prior to the Rajput and early Muhammadan invasions, have now entirely disappeared from this part of the country, or been absorbed into some one or other of the Hindu low castes, as the Census only returns 19 Bhars in the whole Lucknow Division. The Muhammadan population consists of 347,466 Sunnis and 41,688 Shi\u00e1s, the latter, who are chiefly found in the neighbourhood of Lucknow City, being the descendants\nof the courtiers and retainers of the Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edrs. Of the Christians, 4631 are Europeans, 1000 Eurasians, 5 Armenians, and 771 native converts.\n\nLucknow Division contains a large urban population, the number of towns, including Lucknow city and cantonment, with upwards of five thousand inhabitants, being 18, with an aggregate town population of 386,256, or 14.7 per cent. of the total population. The remainder, or rural population, is divided among 4676 villages, classified as follows:\u20141399 contain less than two hundred inhabitants, 1786 from two hundred to five hundred, 1018 from five hundred to a thousand, 368 from one to two thousand, 68 from two to three thousand, and 36 from three to five thousand.\n\nTotal adult agricultural population, male and female, 854,989, consisting of 30,502 landholders, 598,599 cultivators, 220,250 field labourers, and 5638 agents, etc. The population dependent on the soil, however, numbers 1,705,388, or 65.02 per cent. of the whole population of the Division. Of the total area of 4504.5 square miles, 4371.7 square miles are assessed for Government revenue. Of these, 2493.6 square miles were under cultivation in 1881, 892.9 square miles were cultivable but not under cultivation, and 985.2 square miles were uncultivable waste. Total Government assessment, including local rates and cesses, \u00a3395,266, or an average of 4s. 11\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total rental paid by cultivators, \u00a3742,607, or an average of 9s. 0\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. The gross revenue of the Lucknow Division in 1882-83 was \u00a3479,581; the total charges for civil administration, as represented by the cost of officials and police, was returned at \u00a356,576. Justice is administered by 41 criminal courts, including that of the Judicial Commissioner of the Province, and 37 civil and revenue courts. Total number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 32; strength of regular police, 2386 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 7485.\n\n**Lucknow.**\u2014District of Oudh, in the Lucknow Division or Commissionership, under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces; lying between 26\u00b0 30' and 27\u00b0 9' 30\" N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 44' and 81\u00b0 15' 30\" E. long. Area, 989.6 square miles; population (1881) 696,824. Lucknow is bounded on the north by Hardoi and S\u00edt\u00e1pur; on the east by Bara Banki; on the south by R\u00e1i Bareli; and on the west by Unao Districts. In shape, the District is an irregular oblong, running north-west and south-east; average length, 45 miles; average breadth, 25 miles. The administrative head-quarters are at **Lucknow City**, the capital of the Province.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The general aspect of the country is that of an open champaign, studded with villages, finely wooded, and in parts most fertile and highly cultivated. In the vicinity of rivers, however,\nstretch extensive barren sandy tracts (bh\u00fbr), and there are many large sterile wastes of saline efflorescence (\u00fbs\u00e2r). The country is an almost dead level throughout, the average slope, which is from north-west to south-east, being less than a foot per mile. The principal rivers are the G\u00fbmt\u00ee and the Sai, with their tributaries. The former enters the District from the north, and, after passing Lucknow city, turns to the east and enters Bara Banki. Its chief tributaries are the Beht\u00e1 and Nagwa, two small streams, which join it on its right bank. The Sai forms the south-west boundary of the District, running almost parallel with the G\u00fbmt\u00ee, receiving as tributaries in Lucknow the Lon\u00ee and B\u00e1nk nad\u00ees.\n\nHistory.\u2014The following paragraphs on the history of the District are condensed from the Official Settlement Report:\u2014\n\n'Very few of the existing clans are of ancient date. Lucknow itself was not, by the most probable accounts, founded before the time of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jai Chand of Kanauj, the downfall of whose kingdom at the hands of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn, in 1194 A.D., saw the last of the Hindu dynasties of Northern India passing away; and the colonization of the whole of this part of the country seems due to the dispersion of the R\u00e1jputs, which the Musalm\u00e1n conquest effected. There are, so far as I have been able to gather, only two or three exceptions to this\u2014in the Janw\u00e2rs of Saindar in Dew\u00e1; in the Parih\u00e2rs of Ghugt\u00eer in K\u00fbrs\u00ee, since driven back to Ahmamau; and in the Gautamas of Sassaindi in the Mohanl\u00e2lganj pargan\u00e2. The history of the former is very ancient, and seems strangely blended with that of the Bhars and Bahr\u00e2\u00edch. The traditions of the Gautamas of Sassaindi connect them with the kingdom of Kanauj, and the B\u00e1is of B\u00e1isw\u00e2r\u00e1, to whose powerful kingdom they became subject, subsequent to their own occupation and ownership of the soil. Some few of the R\u00e1jput colonies\u2014as the Punw\u00e2rs of Itaunj\u00e1 (Mahona) and the Chauh\u00e2ns of Amosi\u2014conducted their invasions under the auspices, and with the sanction, of the Delhi Emperors; for at that time the Muhammadan rule in this Province was little more than nominal, and all that the R\u00e1jputs effected seems to have been due to their own strength and exertions.\n\n'The R\u00e1jputs, after the tide of their immigration had once set in, made themselves masters of the whole country. Amethias and Gautamas possessed themselves of Mohanl\u00e2lganj and Nighoh\u00e1n. Subsequently there came to the former pargan\u00e2 a colony of Janw\u00e2rs from Ikauna in Bahr\u00e2\u00edch; but they settled peaceably under the Shaikhs, who had invaded and driven out the Amethias from the north of the pargan\u00e2\u2014then known as Amethi\u2014in the middle of the 16th century.\n\n'B\u00e1is to the south, and Chauh\u00e2ns through the centre, of the pargan\u00e2 held Bijnaur; and B\u00e1is invaded and possessed themselves\nof K\u00e1kori. Janw\u00e1rs and Raikw\u00e1rs settled in Mohan-Aur\u00e1s; Nikumbhs, Gah\u00edrw\u00e1rs, Gautamas, and Janw\u00e1rs spread through Malih\u00e1b\u00e1d; Punw\u00e1rs and Chauhans invaded Mahona; and Janw\u00e1rs held the north of K\u00fars\u00ed and Dew\u00e1. At an early period, the Janw\u00e1rs were invaded by a tribe of P\u00e1rih\u00e1rs, and confined in K\u00fars\u00ed to the north of the Kaly\u00e1ni. In Dew\u00e1, they succumbed to a family of B\u00e1\u00eds.\n\n'Then came the Musalm\u00e1n conquest. Little seems to have been effected by the first invasion of Sayyid Mas\u00e1\u00fad in 1030 A.D. Traces of it may have remained in some of the old pargan\u00e1 towns, which he made his encamped settlements, as in Nagr\u00e1m and Amethi of pargan\u00e1 Mohanl\u00e1lganj\u2014through which he is said to have passed\u2014where mahall\u00e1s are still existing, containing, as it is said, the descendants of his old followers who founded them. But for a long time they did not dare venture far from any of these, or from the head-quarters which he had fixed for them at Satrikh.\n\n'The next invasion was that of Muhammad Bakhtiy\u00e1r Khilji, during the time of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn, in 1202 A.D. But he too seems to have left but little trace behind him. He may have founded the village of Bakhhtiy\u00e1r-nagar, near Malih\u00e1b\u00e1d, and may have left some Path\u00e1ns in the town itself; but\u2014though they may have resisted any attack made upon themselves, as in the case of the B\u00e1\u00eds under the Bais R\u00e1j\u00e1 S\u00e1thna of K\u00e1kori\u2014they never ventured out into the surrounding country to colonize it.\n\n'The earliest Musalm\u00e1n colonies do not probably date from much before the middle of the 13th century. Amongst the first to come were the Shaikhs of Kasmand\u00ed in the Malih\u00e1b\u00e1d pargan\u00e1, and the Sayyids of Salim\u00e1b\u00e1d in K\u00fars\u00ed. Then came the Shaikhs of Kidw\u00e1ra in the Lucknow pargan\u00e1, in the direction of Satrikh, and those of Kheoli in Dew\u00e1. Many scattered Musalm\u00e1n communities are spread also through K\u00fars\u00ed and Dew\u00e1, but the native accounts favour the belief that they originated from Satrikh.\n\n'The Musalm\u00e1ns frequently made short incursions from Satrikh. One of the first places they attacked was the town of Dew\u00e1, where they seem to have established themselves under Sh\u00e1h Wesh, a captain of Sayyid Mas\u00e1\u00fad; and they penetrated in the direction of Lucknow as far as the town of Mandi\u00e1on or Mari\u00e1on, where they met with a repulse, and their leader fell. In a village is still a tomb of portentous length, in which a nau gaza p\u00edr, so called from his height, is said to have been buried. By far the greater part of the Musalm\u00e1n proprietorship of villages in the District dates from the time when a Musalm\u00e1n government was firmly established within the limits of the Province. They were naturally attracted towards the settlements of their own countrymen; and Musalm\u00e1n villages stretch through the south of pargan\u00e1s Dew\u00e1, K\u00fars\u00ed, and Lucknow, up to K\u00e1kori.\nLocal tradition states that the owners of the country, before the early R\u00e1jput and Muhammadan settlers, were certain low-caste tribes of Bhars, Arakhs, and P\u00e1s\u00eds. Who the Bhars were, is a question that still remains unanswered. Mr. Elliot says that they overran the country after the loss of Ajodhya by the Surajbansi tribes. The country had then apparently relapsed into primeval wilderness. The natives' only conception of it is that of a vast uninhabited jungle, in which none but saints and anchorites lived, who passed their time in prayer and meditation. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Janmajai, son of Parikshit, grandson of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Yudisthira, of mythical times, granted them the land in j\u00e1gir.\n\nThe foundation of many of the towns is attributed to devotees, as Mandi\u00e1on to Mandal Rikh, Mohan to Mohangir Gos\u00e1in, Jugaur to Jagdeo Jogi, Dew\u00e1 to Dew\u00e1l Rikh; and they may belong to these times. The Bhars, then, found the country open to them; and in this District there was certainly some dominant clan that ruled the country, so far south as the Sai, up to the end of the 12th century.\n\nThey seem to be of aboriginal origin, and some say belong to the forest tribes of Kols, Bhils, Kir\u00e1ts, Hais, Pardh\u00e1ns, and Th\u00e1r\u00fas, and originally came from the Tar\u00e1i. Ruins of Bhar dihis or village sites, cover the face of the country. They seem to have built in brick, which is more than their successors the Hindus do. The Kanauj dynasty before its fall made great efforts to wrest the country from them. Al\u00e1 and Udan, Ban\u00e1phar R\u00e1jputs, were sent by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jai Chandra, and first attacked Nath\u00e1w\u00e1n near Bijnaur, which is said to have been held by a P\u00e1s\u00ed R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bigli; they then advanced to Sars\u00e1w\u00e1 near Amethi, and afterwards to Dew\u00e1, but seem to have got no farther.\n\nIn describing the settlements of P\u00e1s\u00eds and Bhars, etc., P\u00e1s\u00eds and Arakhs seem to have been in strength in Malih\u00e1b\u00e1d and to have stretched south to K\u00e1k\u00f3r\u00ed and Bijnaur, and along the left bank of the Sai to Sassaind\u00ed. All to the east of them were Bhars.\n\nThe P\u00e1s\u00eds must have been an aboriginal tribe; they are disowned by every one else, and their habits would favour it. Their fondness for drink was notorious. There is not a story told of the conquest of any fort, but that it was effected by plying the occupants with wine. This is told of Bhars and P\u00e1s\u00eds alike. The natives connect them with Arakhs; they have an account of a Bhar dynasty founded about A.D. 918, by Tilok Chand, the head of the tribe. This chief fixed upon Bahr\u00e1ich as his seat of empire, and led a powerful army against R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bikramp\u00e1l of Delhi, whom he defeated and dispossessed of his kingdom. It is then said that he held all the country up to Delhi, and all Oudh up to the mountains. His dynasty lasted for nine generations, or one hundred and fifteen years, up to A.D. 1093. It ended with R\u00e1n\u00ed Bhem Dev\u00ed, wife of Gobind Chand, who died without an heir, and\nbequeathed the kingdom to her priestly confessor (s\u016br\u012b), Hargobind, whose dynasty lasted for fifteen generations.'\n\nPopulation.\u2014The area comprising the present District of Lucknow contained, in 1869, a population of 778,195 souls. At the last Census in 1881, the population was returned at 696,824, showing a decrease of 81,371 souls, or 10\u00b75 per cent., in twelve years. Lucknow was in the very centre of the tract which suffered most severely from the famine of 1877-78, and the fever epidemic of the following year; and the diminution of population is ascribed to these calamities. The results of the Census of 1881 may be briefly summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 989\u00b76 square miles, with 5 towns and 942 villages; number of houses, 131,215. Total population, 696,824, namely, males 365,305, and females 331,519; proportion of males in the total population, 52\u00b74 per cent. Average density of population, 704 persons per square mile; towns and villages per square mile, 0\u00b795; persons per town or village (excluding Lucknow city and cantonments), 471; number of houses per square mile, 132\u00b75; inmates per house, 5\u00b73. Classified according to religion, the population consisted in 1881 of\u2014Hindus, 540,937, or 77\u00b75 per cent.; Muhammadans, 149,921, or 21\u00b75 per cent.; Sikhs, 218; Christians, 6280; Jains, 339; Jews, 10; and P\u0101rs\u012bs, 19. Classified according to age, there were, under 15 years of age\u2014males 120,844, and females 107,234; total children, 228,078, or 32\u00b77 per cent. of the population: 15 years and upwards\u2014males 244,461, and females 224,285; total adults, 468,746, or 67\u00b73 per cent. of the population.\n\nAmong Hindus, the higher castes of Br\u0101hmans and R\u0101jputs bear a less proportion to the general population in Lucknow than in any other District of Oudh. The Census of 1881 returned the Br\u0101hmans at 45,549, or 8\u00b73 per cent. of the Hindu population; R\u0101jputs at 27,765, or 5\u00b71 per cent. The Baniy\u0101s or trading class numbered 18,840; and the K\u0101yasths, or writers and official class, 15,640. Of the lower or S\u016bdra castes, the most numerous were\u2014Ahirs, 65,189; P\u0101s\u012bs (aborigines and one of the dominant classes of the country prior to the R\u0101jput and Muhammadan invasions), 58,435; Cham\u0101rs, 58,396; Lodh\u012bs, 45,778; Kurmis, 21,261; Kachh\u012bs, 19,836; Kor\u012bs, 16,333; Kah\u0101rs, 14,760; Tel\u012bs, 13,428; Dhab\u012bs, 10,621; Nais, 10,439; Barhais, 8711; Bhur\u012bs, 8019; Kumbh\u0101rs, 7314; Tambul\u012bs, 7088; Loh\u0101rs, 6263; Bhang\u012bs, 6061; Gad\u0101rias, 5917; Kalw\u0101rs, 5890; and Son\u0101rs, 5218. Lucknow has a larger proportion of Muhammadans than any other District in Oudh, but this is mainly due to Lucknow city, which contains a Musalm\u0101n population of 94,851. By sect the Muhammadans consist of\u2014Sunn\u012bs, 115,371, and Shi\u0101s, 34,550, the large proportion of the latter being due to the fact that Lucknow was the seat of a Shi\u0101 court during the days of the Naw\u0101b\u012b, and the great majority of\nShi\u00e1s still live in the city and immediate neighbourhood of Lucknow. Of the Muhammadans, 654 are Mewatis by race, descendants of converts to what was then the State religion; 105 G\u00fajars; and 29 R\u00e1jputs. The Christian community comprises \u2014 Europeans, 4590; Eurasians, 946; Armenians, 5; and native converts, 739.\n\nTown and Rural Population.\u2014Including Lucknow city and cantonment, the District contains five towns with a population exceeding five thousand inhabitants, namely, Lucknow City, 239,773, and cantonment, 21,530; Kakori, 7462; Malihabad, 7276; and Amethi, 5654. Total urban population, 281,695, or 40\u00b74 per cent. of the District population. Excluding Lucknow city and cantonment, the urban population numbered only 20,392, or 2\u00b79 per cent. The remainder, forming the rural population, is divided among 942 villages, classified as follows: 292 villages contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 355 from two to five hundred; 203 from five hundred to a thousand; 76 from one to two thousand; 14 from two to three thousand; and 2 from three to five thousand inhabitants. With regard to the occupations of the people, the Census Report thus returns the male population:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including all Government officials and servants, and the learned professions, 13,926; (2) domestic and menial servants, lodging-house keepers, etc., 5724; (3) commercial class, including bankers, traders, carriers, etc., 10,507; (4) agricultural class, including gardeners, herdsmen, shepherds, etc., 118,311; (5) manufacturing and industrial class, including artisans, 54,409; (6) indefinite and non-productive class (comprising 44,605 general labourers, and 117,823 male children, and persons of property of no stated occupation), 162,428.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The total area of Lucknow District, after the recent transfer of pargan\u00e1s Moh\u00e1n Aur\u00e1s, K\u00fars\u00ed, Dew\u00e1 to neighbouring Districts in 1881, is 989\u00b76 square miles. The area under cultivation was estimated by the District officer in 1882-83 at 426,000 acres, or 665 square miles. This estimate includes land counted twice over as yielding two harvests in the year. The actual cultivated area in 1883-84 was only 332,463 acres, of which 139,998 acres were irrigated, entirely by private enterprise. Of the remaining area, 139,046 acres were returned as cultivable, and 155,210 acres as uncultivable waste. There are three harvests in the year, the rabi in spring, the khar\u00edf in the rainy season, and the henwat in the autumn. For the rabi, the chief crops are wheat, barley, gram, peas, gujai (a mixture of wheat and barley), and birra (a mixture of barley and gram, gram predominating). The land under these crops amounts to 150,026 acres, wheat heading the list with 72,329 acres, or more than one-fifth of the whole cultivated area. For the khar\u00edf, the crops are rice, millets, s\u00e1w\u00e1n, mandwa, k\u00e1kun, and Indian corn or maize. For the henwat, the crops are jo\u00e1r and bijra, m\u00e1sh, m\u00fang, moth,\nmas\u016br, and lobia. In addition, there are the valuable tobacco and opium and kachhi\u0101na or vegetable crops; of which tobacco takes up 1527 acres, opium 5623 acres, cotton 910 acres, and the spices, as zira (cumin seed), saunf (aniseed), dhaniya (coriander seed), 402 acres. Irrigation is carried on from rivers, tanks, and wells.\n\nThe total male adult agricultural population in 1881 was returned at 115,088, made up by 5887 landholders, 89,574 cultivators, 18,756 agricultural labourers, and 871 estate officers. Number of cultivated acres to each male agriculturist, 3'01. The population entirely dependent on the soil, however, numbered 317,553, or 45'57 per cent. of the total population of the District. Of the total area of 989'6 square miles, 91'4 square miles are held revenue free, and the remaining 898'2 square miles are assessed for Government revenue. Of the assessed area, 495 square miles were returned in 1881 as under cultivation, 168'7 square miles as cultivable, and 234'5 square miles as uncultivable waste. Total Government assessment, including local rates and cesses levied upon land, \u00a383,843, or an average of 5s. 3\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total rental paid by cultivators, including rates and cesses, \u00a3154,082, or 8s. 10\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. These are the rural rates. In the neighbourhood of towns, rents are much higher.\n\nThe cultivators are almost all deeply in debt, and under advances of seed grain from their landlords. Wages have remained stationary in the country, but in the towns they have decreased, owing to the departure of the Oudh court, and the consequent diminished wealth and population of the city. Ordinary agricultural labourers receive about 1\u00bdd. a day in money, when not paid in grain. Artisans, such as smiths and carpenters, receive 4\u00bdd. a day for work in their own villages, or 6d. a day if called away from home. Prices have risen much of late years. The average rate in Lucknow city for wheat (the staple crop) during the fifteen years preceding annexation, was 24 sers per rupee, or 4s. 8d. per cwt., while during the fifteen years subsequent to annexation (1856-70), it was 19 sers per rupee, or 5s. 11\u00bdd. per cwt. Barley has risen from 36 sers per rupee, or 3s. 1\u00bdd. per cwt., during the fifteen years 1841-55, to 29 sers, or 3s. 10\u00bdd. per cwt., in the fifteen years 1856-70. In 1883 the price for wheat was returned at 18 sers per rupee, or 6s. 3\u00bdd. per cwt.; barley, 20 sers per rupee, or 5s. 7\u00bdd. per cwt.; and common rice, 14\u00bd sers per rupee, or 7s. 9\u00bdd. per cwt. The real rise of prices is, however, much higher. Grain is supplied now by railway from a larger area, the city of Lucknow has fallen off in population, and money is very scarce; all these causes should have cheapened food-grains, but the relative value of wheat compared with money has risen much more than would appear from these figures.\n\nTenures.\u2014Lucknow is mainly a District of small proprietors. In\nthe old District, out of 1498 villages, 374 were owned by 37 t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs. In the District as at present constituted, 21 t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs hold 246 villages. The other villages are either bh\u00e1yach\u00e1ra or zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri. In the former case a community of small proprietors hold a village with its demesne in coparcenary tenure, each shareholder enjoying a portion of the land, and also receiving a share of the rents paid by non-proprietary cultivators. It is a complex tenure. In zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri villages there is no such mixture of rights. Several men are joint proprietors of the village, but they divide the rents only; no one has any permanent or other than permissive interest in any portion of the land. The largest estate in the District is that of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chand Sekar, who holds 28 villages, and pays a Government revenue of \u00a33663 a year.\n\nFamines.\u2014Famines or severe scarcities have occurred in Lucknow in 1769, 1784\u201386, 1837, 1861, 1865\u201366, 1869, 1873, and 1877\u201378\u2014all caused by drought. In 1866, the price of wheat rose to 12 sers per rupee, or 9s. 4d. a cwt.; and in 1869 to as high as 9 sers per rupee, or 12s. 5d. a cwt. Maize and gram were quoted at from 13 to 12 sers per rupee, or from 8s. 7d. to 9s. 4d. a cwt. in 1866 and 1869. At the height of the scarcity of 1873, cheap grain of some kind was to be had at from 18 to 16 sers per rupee, or from 6s. 3d. to 7s. a cwt. During the famine of 1877\u201378, Lucknow was one of the Districts most severely affected, and numerous Government relief works were opened.\n\nRoads and Communications.\u2014The District is well provided with communications by road, river, and railway. Three imperial lines of road branch out south, east, and north to Cawnpur, Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, and S\u00edt\u00e1pur, metalled and bridged throughout, and aggregating, exclusive of the roads in Lucknow city and cantonments, a length of about 500 miles. The principal local lines of road are 6 in number, as follow:\u2014(1) to K\u00fars\u00ed; (2) to Dew\u00e1; (3) to Sult\u00e1npur, passing through Gos\u00e1inganj and Amethi; (4) to R\u00e1i Bareli, passing through Mohanl\u00e1lganj; (5) to Mohan, which, crossing the Sai by a fine old native-built bridge, passes on to Ras\u00fal\u00e1b\u00e1d, in Unao District; (6) to Malih\u00e1b\u00e1d, which runs on to Sand\u00edla, a large town in Hardoi. These roads connect the capital with the pargan\u00e1 towns, and the latter are joined by others running (1) from Mahona through K\u00fars\u00ed to Dew\u00e1, whence it passes on to the District of Bara Banki; (2) from Gos\u00e1inganj through Mohanl\u00e1lganj to meet the Imperial Cawnpur road at Jan\u00e1bganj near Bani bridge; and (3) by a road from Bani bridge through Mohan to Aur\u00e1s, which is there crossed (4) by a road that, passing over the Sai by a substantial bridge, runs through the upper end of the Mohan Aur\u00e1s pargan\u00e1, and joins the Malih\u00e1b\u00e1d and Sand\u00edla road at Rah\u00edm\u00e1b\u00e1d. There is another road, some 7 miles long, leading from Lucknow to Bijnaur. These local roads are well bridged throughout, and though heavy during the rains, are well suited for the\ntraffic of the broad-wheeled carts of the country and the soft-footed bullocks that pull them.\n\nRiver communication is not much used. The G\u00famti flows southeast through part of the District for a total distance of 100 miles. But its course is tortuous, and passage slow; and it is not much used, except for the conveyance of wood and straw, which is carried down in barges, freighted sometimes with so much as 40 or 50 tons each. On the whole, the G\u00famti may be said to bar rather than further communication, but Government ferry-boats are attached to various gh\u00e1ts.\n\nThe line of railway is comprised in the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway system. It branches out in three directions\u2014east, south-west, and north-east. The first passes through the thickly-populated pargan\u00e1 of Lucknow to Bara Banki, and, sending a branch to Bahr\u00e1mgh\u00e1t on the Gogra, passes on through Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) towards Benares. The next connects Lucknow with Cawnpur, a line of 48 miles, of which about 16 miles run through this District. The last communicates with Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, and passing the large and important towns of K\u00e1kori and Malih\u00e1b\u00e1d, traverses the Malih\u00e1b\u00e1d pargan\u00e1 on its way through Hardoi to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, Bareli, and Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d. The entire length of railway communication in the District is 53 miles.\n\nManufactures, Trade, etc.\u2014Manufactures are mainly confined to Lucknow City. In the country towns are a few weavers, dyers, bangle-makers, brass-workers, and potters. Cotton-weaving has greatly declined since the introduction of European goods. The principal imports of the District are foodstuffs, piece-goods, arms, hardware, glass, crockery, and salt; exports\u2014muslins, embroidery, cotton prints, brass vessels, lace, tobacco, etc.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The Judicial Commissioner of Oudh, and the Commissioner of the Lucknow Division, have their head-quarters in Lucknow city. For a period of the year it is also the head-quarters of the Provincial Government. The District is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, aided by one Magistrate in special charge of the city, and a second in the cantonments, 1 or 2 Assistant Commissioners, 3 extra-Assistant Commissioners, 3 t\u0101hsild\u00e1rs, and 4 Honorary Magistrates. Besides, there are a Civil Judge and a Small Cause Court Judge, who have no criminal or revenue powers. The total imperial and local revenue of Lucknow District in 1871\u201372 amounted to \u00a3162,926, and the expenditure to \u00a370,534; the Government land revenue was \u00a370,580. In 1883\u201384, with a reduced area, the gross revenue of the District was \u00a3127,590, of which \u00a370,258 was derived from the land-tax. The total cost of civil administration, as represented by the cost of officials and police, was \u00a329,564.\n\nIncluding the Courts of the Judicial Commissioner of the Province and of the Commissioner of the Division, Lucknow contains 11\ncriminal and 7 civil courts, with a regular police force, including city and cantonment police, of 1764 officers and men, and a village watch or rural police numbering 1447 men. The District is sub-divided for revenue purposes into the three tahsils of Lucknow, Mohanlalganj and Malihabad; and for police purposes into 13 circles (thandas). The District jail contained a daily average of 495 prisoners in 1883.\n\nEducation was afforded in 1883 by 137 schools, supported or aided by Government, and inspected by the Education Department, with a total roll on the 31st March 1883 of 6609 pupils. This is exclusive of unaided and uninspected schools, and the Census Report of 1881 returned 7760 boys and 719 girls as under instruction, besides 26,369 males and 1438 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The principal educational institutions are the Arts College at Lucknow with its law and medical classes, and attached High School; the Sanskrit College, and the La Martini\u00e8re College for the education of Europeans and Eurasians.\n\nThe only regular municipality in the District is that of Lucknow city; but a house-tax for police and conservancy purposes is raised in the following towns\u2014Kakori, Malihabad, Amethi, Bijnaur, Chinhata, Amanganj, Itaunja, and Gosainganj.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Average annual rainfall in the District generally, 37.6 inches; in Lucknow city, 41.4 inches. Mean annual temperature, 77.8\u00b0 F. In the year 1883, the maximum temperature in May, the hottest month, was 115\u00b0; the minimum in February, the coldest month, was 38.3\u00b0.\n\nThe prevailing endemic diseases of the District are fevers, skin diseases, and bowel complaints. The most common kind of fever is intermittent of the quotidian type; the quartan type is comparatively rare. Remittent fever is not uncommon. Cholera is seldom absent from the District. There is no year in which a considerable number of deaths is not ascribed to this disease. Both forms of cholera (sporadic and epidemic) are met with. The disease appears at the setting in of the rains, and is generally prevalent during the months of July, August, September, October, and November. Small-pox generally makes its appearance in March, and attains its maximum intensity in the months of April, May, and June. It begins to decline during the rains, and almost disappears by the middle of the cold weather. Small-pox rages with virulence among all ranks of society; and, in the absence of general vaccination, numbers are carried off by it every year. The total number of deaths registered from fevers in Lucknow District (excluding the city) in 1883 was 8044, giving a rate of 17.60 per thousand of the rural population. An epidemic of small-pox in the same year caused 7500 deaths, or a rate of 16.41 per thousand. The total number of registered deaths in 1883 in the District (outside\nthe city) was 17,560, or at the rate of 38\u00b743 per thousand, against an average of 35\u00b709 per thousand in the previous five years. In Lucknow city in 1883, the deaths from fever numbered 5127, and from smallpox 2114, the total mortality being at the rate of 34\u00b766 per thousand. Total registered deaths in District and city in 1883, 28,630. The principal medical institutions are the King's hospital, civil dispensary, and Balrampur hospital in the city of Lucknow, at which 40,480 patients received medical relief in 1883. A lunatic asylum for the whole of Oudh is situated upon the eastern bank of the G\u00famti, near the Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d road. [For further information regarding Lucknow, see the Gazetteer of Oudh, vol. ii. pp. 301-396 (published by authority, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, 1877); the Report on the Land Settlement of Lucknow District, by Mr. H. H. Butts, C.S. (Lucknow, 1873); the Census Report of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh for 1881; and the several Administration and Departmental Reports from 1880 to 1884.]\n\n**Lucknow.**\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of Lucknow District, Oudh, lying between 26\u00b0 38' 30\" and 27\u00b0 0' 15\" N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 42' and 81\u00b0 8' 30\" E. long. Bounded on the north by Malih\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil; on the east by Bari Banki District; on the south by Mohanl\u00e1lganj tahsil; and on the west by Mohan tahsil of Unao. This tahsil comprises the 3 pargan\u00e1s of Lucknow, Bijnaur, and Kakori. Population (1869) 468,507; (1881) 414,570, namely, males 219,327, and females 195,243. The decrease of 53,937, or 11\u00b75 per cent., between the twelve years 1869-1881 is, as explained in the article on Lucknow District, mainly attributable to the famine of 1877-78, and the fever epidemic of the following year. Classified according to religion, the population in 1881 consisted of\u2014Hindus, 291,179; Muhammadans, 116,541; Jains, 338; 'others,' 6512. Total number of villages and towns, 343, of which 222 contain less than five hundred inhabitants. The tahsil contains (including the head-quarter Courts of the Judicial Commissioner of Oudh, the Commissioner of the Lucknow Division, and the Deputy-Commissioner of the District) 9 criminal and 7 civil courts. Number of police circles, 3; strength of regular police, 1625 men (including 876 municipal police), besides a rural police or village watch of 461 chaukid\u00e1rs.\n\n**Lucknow.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of Lucknow District, Oudh; the tract lying immediately around Lucknow City, in which the whole interest of the pargan\u00e1 centres. Area, 165 square miles, of which 96 are returned as under cultivation, being practically the whole of the land available for tillage. Population (1869), including Lucknow city, 368,977; (1881) 323,970, namely, males 172,189, and females 151,781. Rents are high, but, as elsewhere, R\u00e1jputs pay less than the lower castes. Their average rent is 7s. 9d. per acre, while Lodhis pay 12s. 6d., and Kachhis as high as 27s. 3d. an acre. In individual instances in\nvillages around the city, rents amount to as much as \u00a34, and even \u00a35 an acre. Government land revenue, \u00a314,746; average incidence, 5s. per cultivated acre. In villages around the city, the assessment falls at the rate of 13s. \u00bdd. per acre. Besides Lucknow City, the pargan\u00e1 contains the towns of Ujariaon, Juggam, Chinh\u00e1t, Mah\u00e1baliipur, and Th\u00e1war. Total number of towns and villages, 180.\n\nLucknow (L\u00e1khnao). \u2014 Capital city of the Province of Oudh; situated on both banks of the river G\u00famti, in lat. 26\u00b0 51' 40\" N., and long. 80\u00b0 58' 10\" E. Distant from Cawnpur 42 miles, from Benares 199 miles, from Calcutta 610 miles. Area, 13 square miles. Population in 1881\u2014city, 239,773, and cantonments, 21,530; total, 261,303. Though quite a modern town, Lucknow at present ranks fourth in size amongst British Indian cities, being only surpassed by the three Presidency capitals of Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay. It stands on a plain, 403 feet above sea-level. Till recent years, it formed the metropolis of a great Muhammadan kingdom, and afterwards contained the administrative head-quarters of a considerable British Province; while even at the present day it retains its position as a centre of modern Indian life, being a leading city of native fashion, and a chief school of music, grammar, and Musalm\u00e1n theology. Trade and manufactures are now beginning to restore the wealth which it formerly owed to the presence of the luxurious court of the Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edrs or kings of Oudh.\n\nSituation and General Appearance.\u2014Lucknow stands on both banks of the G\u00famti, but the greater portion of the city stretches along its western side, a few suburbs only covering the farther shore. Four bridges span the river, two of them built by native rulers, and two since the British annexation in 1856. Viewed from a distance, Lucknow presents a picture of unusual magnificence and architectural splendour, which fades on nearer view into the ordinary aspect of a crowded oriental town. Some of the most striking buildings, which look like marble in the moonlight, are disclosed by the disillusioning sun to be degraded examples of stucco and brick. From the new bridge across the G\u00famti, the city seems to be embedded in trees. High up the river, the ancient stone bridge of Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1 crosses the stream. To its left rise the walls of the Mach\u00ed Bhawan fort, enclosing the Lakshman til\u00e1 (Lakshman's hill), the earliest inhabited spot in the city, from which it derives its modern name. Close by, the immense Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, or mausoleum of Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1, towers above the surrounding buildings. Farther in the distance, the lofty minarets of the Jam\u00e1 Masjid or 'cathedral mosque' overlook the city; while nearer again, on the same side of the river, the ruined walls of the Residency, with its Memorial Cross, recall the heroic defence made by the British garrison in 1857. In front, close to the water's edge, the Chattar Manzil\npalace, a huge and irregular pile of buildings, crowned by gilt umbrellas, glitters gaudily in the sunlight; while to the left, at some little distance, two mausoleums flank the entrance to the Kaisar B\u00e2gh, the last of the overgrown palaces built by the exiled dynasty of Oudh.\n\nStill more picturesque panoramas may be obtained from any of the numerous towers and cupolas which abound in every quarter. But a nearer examination shows that Lucknow does not correspond in its interior arrangements to its brilliant appearance from a little distance. Nevertheless, many of its streets are broader and finer than those of most Indian towns; and the clearance effected for military purposes after the Mutiny, has resulted in greatly improving both the aspect and the sanitary condition of the city. A glacis half a mile broad surrounds the fort; and three military roads, radiating from this point as a centre, cut right through the heart of the native quarter, often at an elevation of some 30 feet above the neighbouring streets. Three other main roads also branch out from the same point, one leading across the bridge, and the two others along the banks of the G\u00famti. The Residency crowns a picturesque eminence, the chief ornament of the city, containing, besides many ruined walls, an old mosque and a magnificent banian tree. An artificial mound rises near at hand, its sides gay with parterres of flowers; while in the rear, half hidden by the feathery foliage of gigantic bamboos, the graveyard covers the remains of some 2000 Europeans, who perished by war or massacre during the Mutiny of 1857. The various architectural works which adorn or disfigure Lucknow may best be considered in their historical order. South-east of the city, and separated from it by a canal, lie the cantonments, which extend over an area of 11 or 12 square miles.\n\nHistory.\u2014Like so many of the great modern cities of India, Lucknow owes its importance almost entirely to the last century. It first rose to greatness as the capital of the young dynasty which established itself in Oudh during the decay of the Mughal Empire, and spread its rule, not only over the modern Province, but also through the neighbouring tracts of Rohilkhand, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, Cawnpur, and Gh\u00e1zipur. From very early times, however, a small village probably existed upon the spot where the family of Sa\u00e1dat Kh\u00e1n afterwards fixed the seat of their supremacy. The earliest inhabitants appear to have been Br\u00e1hmans and K\u00e1yasths, who dwelt around the Lakshman t\u00eeld, now the high ground enclosed within the Mach\u00ed Bhawan fort. Here Lakshman, brother of R\u00e1m Chandra, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ajodhya, having obtained a large tract of country up to the Gogra in j\u00e1gir, founded the village of Lakshmanpur, on a spot sacred to Sesn\u00e1g, the thousand-headed snake, who supports the world upon his back. A mosque, built by the bigoted\nAurangzeb, now covers the holy place. The village of Lakshmanpur still stood within the memory of men now living.\n\nThe Shaikhs, afterwards known as the Shaikhzadas of Lucknow, were the earliest Muhammadan conquerors of Oudh. Later on, the Pathans of Ramnagar occupied the country up to the point where the Gol Darwaza gate subsequently stood. East of this demarcating line, the Shaikhs bore rule, and built a stronghold on the site of the present Machi Bhawan fort. A small town grew up around their castle, which bore the name of Lucknow at least as early as the reign of Akbar. In the survey carried out by that Emperor, it is described as 'a large city pleasantly situated upon the banks of the G\u00famti, with very delightful suburbs.' The Ain-i-Akbari also mentions the tomb of Shaikh Mina Shah, a Musalm\u00e1n saint, to whom prayers were already offered. The Brahmins then formed a leading section of the population; and Akbar, with his usual tolerant indifference, wishing to gratify them, caused the Baj pei sacrifice to be offered, and gave them a lakh of rupees. The city grew but little before his time, and its subsequent enlargements belong to three periods, those of Akbar himself, of Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, and of Asaf-ud-daula. The oldest inhabited portions of the present city are the Hindu wards, lying in the immediate neighbourhood of the chauk. The wards to the south, along the line of the chauk, were built under Akbar, who took a great fancy to the town, and did much to promote its welfare. His son, Mirza Salim Shah, afterwards the Emperor Jahangir, founded Mirza Mandi, lying to the west of the enceinte of the present fort. But none of the great buildings which now adorn the city date back to an earlier period than that of the independent Oudh dynasty.\n\nSa\u00e1dat Khan, founder of the Oudh kingdom, began life as a Persian merchant of Naishapur, and ended it as the greatest Asiatic warrior of his age, except perhaps Ahmad Khan. He became Governor (Subahdar) of Oudh in 1732 A.D., and fixed his residence at Lucknow.\n\nUnlike his descendants, who built themselves the tasteless palaces which now fill the city, Sa\u00e1dat Khan was content with a comparatively humble dwelling, situated behind the Machi Bhawan. An open space, south-west of the fort, now occupied by ordnance stores, marks the site of two early buildings, the oldest in Lucknow erected by the family of Shaikhs who formerly ruled over the surrounding territory. When Sa\u00e1dat Khan assumed the reins of local government as Subahdar, he hired these houses from their owners at a moderate monthly rent. At first, the money was regularly paid; but in process of time, the ruling family began to regard the buildings as their own, and the rent fell into arrears. Safdar Jang and Shuja-ud-daula gave written agreements to fulfil the engagement, but never kept them; and Asaf-ud-daula finally confiscated the houses outright, without any compensation.\nSa\u00e1dat Kh\u00e1n himself met at first with some opposition from the Shaikhs; but in the end he was completely successful, and before his death he had made Oudh practically an independent principality. Even in his old age he retained his personal strength and his military skill; and his Hindu foes recorded with awe how he slew in single combat Bhagwant Singh Khichi, and how his troops, when almost beaten, rushed again to the conflict where the long white beard of their chief led the van of the battle.\n\nHis son-in-law and successor, Safdar Jang (1743), lived at Delhi as Waz\u00edr; but he built the fort of Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, 3 miles south of the city, to intimidate the B\u00e1\u00eds of B\u00e1\u00edsw\u00e1r\u00e1. He also rebuilt the old stronghold of Lakshmanpur, which thenceforth bore the name of Mach\u00ed Bhawan, from his own crest (a fish\u2014machi). Under his rule, too, the bridge across the river was begun, though not completed till the time of Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1. Safdar Jang\u2019s son and successor, Shuj\u00e1-ud-daul\u00e1 (1753), lived at Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d after the battle of Baksar (Buxar); and Lucknow received no additions during his rule.\n\nThe three earliest Naw\u00e1bs of the Oudh dynasty were soldiers and statesmen, all of whom took the field in person against English, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and Rohill\u00e1s, or against the great nobles whose feudal power had reduced the central authority to a mere name. Under their government, therefore, Lucknow received few architectural embellishments of an ornamental kind. Only works of military utility, such as forts, wells, and bridges, engaged their attention; though the city continued to grow, as the head-quarters of the ruling house, and several wards were added on its spreading outskirts.\n\nWith Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1, the fourth Naw\u00e1b, a new political situation developed. He lived the contented and servile ally of the English. By their aid, Oudh had acquired Rohilkhand, and might acquire Benares; and he felt himself independent of his own people. The grandeur of Lucknow dates from the reign of this Naw\u00e1b. Yet his works did not degenerate into the mere personal extravagance of his successors. He built bridges and mosques, as well as the Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, the chief architectural glory of Lucknow. Though inferior to the purest Muham-madan models of Delhi and Agra, the Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, taken together with the adjoining mosque and the R\u00fami Darw\u00e1za, forms a group of striking magnificence and picturesque splendour. Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1\u2019s erections are simple and grand, free from the base admixture of bastard Greek and Italian features which disfigure the later style of the Oudh dynasty. The Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, constructed during the great famine of 1784, as a relief work for the starving people, now covers the remains of its founder. Tradition relates that many of the most respectable inhabitants, compelled by want, enrolled themselves amongst the workmen; and that to save their honour and keep their identity unknown, their names were\ncalled over, and their wages paid, at dead of night. The building consists of one large hall of immense size and magnificence. It measures 167 feet in length by 52 in breadth, and cost, according to local computation, no less than a million sterling. The gaudy decorations which once covered its walls have now disappeared; and as the mausoleum stands within the walls of the fort, it serves at present as an arsenal for the British garrison. The building is as solid as it is graceful, being raised upon very deep foundations, and without a single piece of woodwork in its construction. Mr. Fergusson, though he has little to say in favour of any other architectural work in Lucknow, praises the admirable vaulting of the Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, and observes that the mausoleum, 'when not too closely looked into, is not unfit to be spoken of in the same chapter as the earlier buildings.'\n\nAmongst other works of Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1, the R\u00fami Darw\u00e1za, a fine old massive and isolated gateway that still leads out of the Mach\u00ed Bhawan fort, ranks highest in importance. The Daulat-kh\u00e1na, along the banks of the river west of the fort, and the magnificent palace known as the Residency, also belong to the same period. The latter edifice looks down upon the G\u00famti from a considerable elevation, and forms the most striking feature in the whole of Lucknow. It was allotted to the British Resident by Sa\u00e1dat Al\u00ed when he made his own home in the magnificent Farhat Baksh. Outside the city, and across the river, lies the palace of Bibi\u00e1pur, built by Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1 as a country residence and hunting-lodge. Numerous other handsome edifices in various parts of the town attest the greatness of the same Naw\u00e1b, whose memory is still preserved in popular rhymes as the embodiment of liberality and magnificence.\n\nTo the reign of Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1 belongs also the Martini\u00e8re, a school founded by General Claude Martin, and completed after his death. It consists of a colossal Italian villa on an exaggerated scale. General Martin himself designed the plan and elevation, and showed them to the Naw\u00e1b, who wished to buy the building for a million sterling. The founder's bones were buried within the Martini\u00e8re to prevent its confiscation by the Musalm\u00e1n court, but were dug up and scattered during the Mutiny. The school now affords clothing and education to 120 boys.\n\nUnder Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1, the Lucknow court reached its highest splendour. The dominions of the Naw\u00e1b extended over a wider area than at any earlier or later period. All the wealth of the State was devoted to the personal aggrandizement of its ruler, and the accumulation of those materials which minister to oriental pomp. No court in India or in Europe could rival the magnificence of Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1; and his only ambition apparently consisted in discovering how many\nelephants or diamonds the Niz\u00e1m or Tip\u00fa possessed, in order that he might outvie them. At the marriage of his reputed son, Waz\u00edr Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, who four years afterwards murdered Mr. Cherry, and died in Chun\u00e1r prison, the marriage procession consisted of 1200 elephants, and the young prince wore jewels valued at \u00a3200,000. But this vast accumulation of wealth could only be effected by the most crushing taxation. Four years afterwards, Tennant traversed the whole of Oudh, and found almost everywhere a plundered and desolate country. The Naw\u00e1b's dominions, he says, 'in defiance of the bounty of nature, display a uniform sterility.' In Rohilkhand, 'not the hundredth part of an acre is under cultivation;' and 'the solitude and gloom of the Province' were only relieved by a little prosperity where the eunuch Mi\u00e1n Alm\u00e1s administered a few districts with comparative wisdom and moderation. Of Lucknow itself he remarks, 'I never witnessed so many varied forms of wretchedness, filth, and vice.'\n\nSa\u00e1dat Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, half-brother to Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1 (1798), carried his submission to the British power still further. He gave up half his dominions to the English, and in return obtained the protection of their troops quartered in his citadels. Thenceforth the Naw\u00e1bs and kings of Oudh degenerated into a mere fain\u00e9ant dynasty of pleasure-seekers, whose works no longer partook of any national or utilitarian character, but ministered solely to the gratification of the sovereign. In the place of mosques, wells, forts, or bridges, palace after palace sprang up in succession, each more ungraceful and extravagant than the last. At the same time, European influence began to make itself felt in the architecture, which grew gradually more and more debased from reign to reign. Awkward imitations of Corinthian columns supported Musalm\u00e1n domes, while false Venetian blinds and stucco marble replaced the solid masonry of the earlier period. A modest mansion rented from a private family had satisfied the soldier chief, Sa\u00e1dat Kh\u00e1n, and his two successors. One palace sufficed even for the prodigal Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1, the builder of the Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, the chauk, the b\u00e1z\u00e1rs, and the market-places. Sa\u00e1dat Al\u00ed, however, built numerous palaces; while with Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn Haidar began an era of extravagant expenditure on monstrous residences for the royal family and their female dependants. In the Chattar Manzil lived the king's wives; in the Kaisar Pasand and other buildings, his concubines; in the Sh\u00e1h Manzil, his wild beasts. He himself inhabited the Farhat Baksh, the Haz\u00far Bagh, the palace at Bibi\u00e1pur, and many others. W\u00e1jid Ali Sh\u00e1h had 360 concubines, each with a separate range of palatial apartments.\n\nTo Sa\u00e1dat Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n's reign belongs the Farhat Baksh, or 'Giver of Delight,' the chief royal residence till W\u00e1jid Al\u00ed built the Kaisar B\u00e1gh. Part of this magnificent building, overlooking the river, the\nNaw\u00e1b purchased from General Martin. The remainder he himself constructed. The great throne-room, known as the Kasr-us-Sult\u00e1n or L\u00e1l B\u00e1radari, was set apart for royal darb\u00e1rs; and at the accession of a new sovereign, it was customary for the British Resident to seat him on the throne, and present him with a nazar, in token of his confirmation in the sovereignty by the supreme power. Sa\u00e1dat Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n also built all that portion of Lucknow which stretches eastward from the old Hindu wards, besides numerous small palaces, including the D\u00edlkusha, which stands on high ground outside the city, north of the modern cantonments, affording a splendid view of the town, the river, and the surrounding country. In his time, Lucknow finally reached very nearly its present size.\n\nGh\u00e1z\u00ed-ud-d\u00edn Haidar, son of Sa\u00e1dat Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n (1814), was the first of his line who bore the name of king. He built the greater part of the pile known as the Mot\u00ed Mahal palace, around the Mot\u00ed Mahal dome of his father. Along the river face, he added the Mub\u00e1rak Manzil and the Sh\u00e1h Manzil, on either side of the old bridge of boats. The latter formed the scene of the wild-beast fights for which the court of Oudh was famous up to the date of its extinction. Gh\u00e1z\u00ed-ud-d\u00edn Haidar also erected the Chini b\u00e1z\u00e1r, the Chattar Manzil Kal\u00e1n, which faces the river, and the Chattar Manzil Khurd in its rear. The Sh\u00e1h Najaf, on the banks of the G\u00famti, he built for his own tomb; and on the spot formerly occupied by his house when heir-apparent, he raised two magnificent mausoleums to his father and mother. He attempted to dig a canal for irrigation, which now skirts the east and south sides of the city; but it proved a failure, so far as economical results were concerned. The Kadam Ras\u00fal or \u2018Prophet\u2019s Footprint,\u2019 a Muhammadan place of worship, built by Gh\u00e1z\u00ed-ud-d\u00edn, stands upon an artificial mound, and formerly contained a stone bearing the impress of the Prophet\u2019s foot. A pilgrim brought the holy relic from Arabia; but during the troubles of 1857 it disappeared, and has not since been recovered.\n\nNas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn Haidar, son of the last-named monarch (1827), founded the T\u00e1r\u00e1w\u00e1li Kothi or \u2018Observatory,\u2019 under the superintendence of Colonel Wilcox, his astronomer-royal. It contained several excellent instruments. On the death of Colonel Wilcox in 1847, W\u00e1jid Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h dismissed the establishment, and the instruments disappeared during the Mutiny, being probably broken up by the rebels. The Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d Maulvi, Ahmad-ull\u00e1 Sh\u00e1h, made it his head-quarters during the rebellion, and the insurgent council frequently held its meetings within the building. Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn also built a great karbala in Ir\u00e1datnagar, under which he lies buried.\n\nMuhammad Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h, uncle of Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn Haidar (1837), raised his own monument, the magnificent Hus\u00e1inabad Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra. It consists of two enclosures, one of which stands at right angles to the other. Leaving\nthe fort by the great R\u00fami Darw\u00e1za, a broad road near the G\u00famti, a quarter of a mile in length, conducts to the gate of the outer quadrangle. A spectator standing a little to the west of the road can take in at a single view the great Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra of Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1 and the R\u00fami Darw\u00e1za to the right, with the Husain\u00e1b\u00e1d mausoleum and the Jam\u00e1 Masjid to the left. The whole forms one of the finest architectural prospects in the world. This king also laid out a splendid road, which leads from the Chattar Manzil through the fort along the river bank to his Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra. A magnificent tank, standing beside the road, dates from the same reign. Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h likewise began the erection of a mosque, at a short distance from his mausoleum, designed to surpass the Jam\u00e1 Masjid of Delhi in size; but he did not live to complete it, and it stands still half built, with the scaffolding rotting away outside, untouched from the day of his death. The S\u00e1t Khanda or 'Seven-storied Tower,' another of Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h's projected works, remains similarly unfinished, only the fourth storey having reached its completion.\n\nAmjad Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h, the fourth king (1841), made a metalled road to Cawnpur, built his own mausoleum at Hazratganj, and laid down an iron bridge across the G\u00famti. This bridge was brought out from England by order of Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn Haidar, who, however, died before it arrived. His son, Nasir-ud-d\u00edn Haidar, directed that it should be put up opposite the Residency, where a small temple and gh\u00e1t now stand; but the operations for sinking wells to receive the piers proved unsuccessful, and the work was thus delayed till the accession of Amjad Al\u00ed.\n\nW\u00e1jid Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h, the last King of Oudh (1847\u20131856), bears the whole opprobrium for the erection of the Kaisar B\u00e1gh, the largest, gaudiest, and most debased of all the Lucknow palaces. It was commenced in 1848, and finished in 1850, at a cost of 80 l\u00f3khs (say \u00a3800,000). Entering by the north-east gateway, which faces the open space in front of the Observatory, the visitor passes through a court to a gate known as the Jilaukh\u00e1na, whence the royal processions used to start. Turning to the right, through a screened gateway, he arrives at the Ch\u00edni B\u00e1gh, so called from the China vessels which formerly decorated the gardens. A portal flanked by green mermaids, in the worst European taste of the last century, leads next to the Hazrat B\u00e1gh. On the right hand lie the Ch\u00e1ndiw\u00e1li B\u00e1radar\u00ed, once paved with silver, and the Kh\u00e1s Muk\u00e1m, as well as the B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h Manzil, the special residence of the king, erected by Sa\u00e1dat Ali Kh\u00e1n, but included by W\u00e1jid Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h in the plan of his new palace. On the left stands a large confused pile of buildings, called the Chandlakkhi, built by Azim-ull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, the king's barber, and sold by him to the king for 4 l\u00f3khs. It formed the residence of the queen and the chief concubines. In this building the rebel Begam held her court, while the British prisoners lay for weeks in one of the stables.\nclose at hand. The roadway proceeds past a tree, paved round the roots with marble, under whose shade the king used to sit on fair-days, dressed in the yellow robes of a fakir. The Eastern Lakhi gate, so called from its having cost a lakh of rupees, gives access to a magnificent open square, known pre-eminently as the Kaisar B\u0101gh, and surrounded by the residences of the ladies of the harem. In the month of August, a great fair used to be held in this square, to which all Lucknow was admitted. Proceeding past the stone B\u00e1radari, now fitted up as a theatre, and under the Western Lakhi gate, which corresponds to its eastern namesake, the visitor reaches a building known as the Kaisar Pasand, surmounted by a gilt hemisphere. This palace was erected by Roshan-ud-daul\u00e1, minister of Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn Haidar; but W\u00e1jid Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h confiscated it, and gave it as a residence to his favourite concubine, Mashuk-us-Sult\u00e1n. Finally, a second Jilaukh\u00e1na leads once more into the open street.\n\nSince the British annexation, but little has been done in the way of architectural improvement, though charitable dispensaries, schools, and other works of public utility have been largely undertaken. The late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Balr\u00e1mpur, Sir Digbij\u00e1i Singh, K.C.S.I., has also founded a capacious hospital on a plot of high ground adjoining the Residency, with beds for one hundred patients.\n\nArchitecture.\u2014Summarizing the chief architectural features, Lucknow thus contains two noble mosques, one Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra of imperial dimensions, four tombs of regal splendour (those of Sa\u00e1dat Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, of Mushid Z\u00e1di, of Muhammad Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h, and of Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn Haidar), together with two great palaces, or rather collections of palaces (the Chattar Manzil and the Kaisar B\u0101gh). Besides these larger works, it also comprises a whole host of royal garden-houses, pavilions, town mansions, temples, and mosques. Almost every building owes its origin to the late reigning family. The nobles of the court and the merchants could not display their wealth with safety in any other form than the erection of mosques or tombs. It was dangerous for any but the king\u2019s immediate relatives to live in a handsome mansion. Since the annexation, however, the nobility of Oudh have built a large number of town houses. They generally possess an imposing gateway, as one main feature of the fa\u00e7ade, consisting of arch within arch, rising from the same base, and covered with a modern oriental profusion of gaudy colouring.\n\nLucknow contains the most debased examples of architecture to be found in India. Portions of the Kaisar B\u0101gh consist of decoration in the very worst style which prevailed during the last century in Europe, and which, when banished from England, took refuge in India. \u2018No caricatures of architecture,\u2019 says Mr. Fergusson, writing of this city, \u2018are so ludicrous or so bad as those in which Italian details are\nintroduced.' Nowhere else has the oriental become simply vulgar. Nevertheless, many buildings in Lucknow present a sky-line and general plan of considerable beauty. Seen from a distance, the fantastic domes and pinnacles of the Martini\u00e8re, the Chattar Manzil, and the Kaisar B\u0101gh are not without a certain picturesque effect; while the more ancient tombs and minarets rise in solemn contrast of dark grey stone against the gilded summits of their younger rivals. The old buildings, also, are much more solidly built than the new. The Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, now almost a hundred years old, though exposed to a heavy cannonade during the Mutiny, has not lost a single brick; while the Kaisar B\u0101gh, not yet thirty years of age, has suffered much from decay, and already presents a ruinous appearance. Flying buttresses to support nothing but one another, copper domes gilt from top to bottom, burnished umbrellas, and balustrades of burnt clay, form frequent features in the tawdry architecture which renders the distant aspect of Lucknow so bright and sparkling. The plaster of stucco, however, gives considerable beauty to the ordinary dwellings. The finest kind is made from shells found in the dry beds of ancient lakes. This chunam has a brighter and purer appearance than even marble, and when lighted up with thousands of lamps, it produces an exquisitely beautiful effect.\n\nSince the introduction of British rule, the new authorities have laid out well-kept roads, widened the tortuous native streets, and founded commodious b\u00e1z\u0101rs, in which due attention has been paid to the comfort and convenience both of the commercial classes and their customers. The sanitary officers enforce stringent rules of cleanliness; and a municipality, containing many elective members, provides for the welfare of the city, with a just regard to native feeling and wishes.\n\nMutiny Narrative.\u2014A couple of months before the outbreak at Meerut (Merath), Sir Henry Lawrence (20th March 1857) had assumed the Chief Commissionership of the newly annexed Province of Oudh. The garrison at Lucknow then consisted of the 32nd (British) Regiment, a weak company of European artillery, the 7th Regiment Native Light Cavalry, and the 13th, 48th, and 71st Regiments of Native Infantry. In or near the city were also quartered two regiments of irregular local infantry, together with one regiment of military police, one of Oudh irregular cavalry, and two batteries of Native artillery. The town thus contained nearly ten Indian soldiers to every European, or 7000 to 750. Symptoms of disaffection occurred as early as the month of April, when the house of the surgeon to the 48th was burned down in revenge for a supposed insult to caste. Sir Henry Lawrence immediately took steps to meet the danger by fortifying the Residency and accumulating stores. On the 30th of April, the men of the 7th Oudh Irregulars refused to bite their cartridges, on the ground that they had been\ngreased with cow's fat. They were induced with some difficulty to return to their lines. On May 3, Sir Henry Lawrence resolved to deprive the mutinous regiment of its arms, a step which was effected not without serious delay.\n\nOn May 12, Sir Henry held a darb\u00e1r, and made an impressive speech in Hindust\u00e1ni, in which he called upon the people to uphold the British Government, as most tolerant to Hindus and Muhammadans alike. Two days earlier, the massacre at Meerut had taken place, and a telegram brought word of the event on the morning after the darb\u00e1r. On the 19th, Sir Henry Lawrence received the supreme military command in Oudh. He immediately fortified the Residency and the Mach\u00ed Bhawan, bringing the ladies and children into the former building. On the night of the 30th May, the expected insurrection broke out at Lucknow. The men of the 71st, with a few from the other regiments, began to burn the bungalows of their officers, and to murder the inmates. Prompt action was taken, and early next morning the European force attacked, dispersed, and followed up for 10 miles the retreating mutineers, who were joined during the action by the 7th Cavalry. The rebels fled towards Sit\u00e1pur. Although Lucknow thus remained in the hands of the British, by the 12th of June every other post in Oudh had fallen into the power of the mutineers. The Chief Commissioner still held the cantonments and the two fortified posts at the beginning of June, but the symptoms of disaffection in the city and among the remaining native troops were unmistakeable. In the midst of such a crisis, Sir Henry Lawrence's health unhappily gave way. He delegated his authority to a council of five, presided over by Mr. Gubbins, the Financial Commissioner, but shortly after recovered sufficiently to resume the command. On June the 11th, however, the military police and native cavalry broke into open revolt, followed on the succeeding morning by the native infantry. On the 20th of June, news of the fall of Cawnpur arrived; and on the 29th, the enemy, 7000 strong, advanced upon Chinh\u00e1t, a village on the Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d road, 8 miles from the Residency. Sir Henry Lawrence marched out and gave the enemy battle at that spot. The result proved disastrous to our arms, through the treachery of the Oudh artillery, and a retreat became necessary. The troops fell back on Lucknow, abandoned the Mach\u00ed Bhawan, and concentrated all their strength upon the Residency. The siege of the enclosure began upon 1st July. On the 2nd, as Sir Henry Lawrence lay on his bed, a shell entered the room, burst, and wounded him severely. He lingered till the morning of the 4th, and then died in great agony. Major Banks succeeded to the civil command, while the military authority devolved upon Brigadier Inglis. On 20th July, the enemy made an unsuccessful assault. Next day, Major Banks was shot, and the sole command was undertaken by Inglis.\nOn the 10th of August, the mutineers attempted a second assault, which was again unsuccessful. The third assault took place on the 18th; but the enemy were losing heart as they found the small garrison so able to withstand them, and the repulse proved comparatively easy.\n\nMeanwhile, the British within were dwindling away and eagerly expecting reinforcements from Cawnpur. On 5th September, news of the relieving force under Outram and Havelock reached the garrison by a faithful native messenger. On 22nd September, the relief arrived at the Alambagh, a walled garden on the Cawnpur road held by the enemy in force. Havelock stormed the Alambagh, and on the 25th fought his way with continuous opposition through the narrow lanes of the city. On the 26th he arrived at the gate of the Residency enclosure, and was welcomed by the gallant defenders within. General Neill fell during the action outside the walls. The sufferings of the besieged had been very great; but even after the first relief, it became clear that Lucknow could only be temporarily defended till the arrival of further reinforcements should allow the garrison to cut its way out. Outram, who had now re-assumed the command which he generously yielded to Havelock during the relief, accordingly fortified an enlarged area of the town, bringing many important outworks within the limits of defence; and the siege began once more till a second relieving party could set the besieged at liberty. Night and day the enemy kept up a continual firing against our position, while Outram retaliated by frequent sorties.\n\nThroughout October the garrison continued its gallant defence, and a small party, shut up in the Alambagh, and cut off unexpectedly from the main body, also contrived to hold good its dangerous post. Meanwhile, Sir Colin Campbell's force had advanced from Cawnpur, and arrived at the Alambagh on the 10th of November. From the day of his landing at Calcutta, Sir Colin had never ceased in his endeavours to collect an army to relieve Lucknow, by gathering together the liberated Delhi field force and the fresh reinforcements from England. On the 12th, the main body threw itself into the Alambagh, after a smart skirmish with the rebels. Sir Colin next occupied the Dilkusha palace, south-east of the town, and then moved against the Martini\u00e8re, which the enemy had fortified with guns in position. After carrying that post, he forded the canal, and on the 16th attacked the Sikandra Bagh, the chief rebel stronghold. The mutineers, driven to bay, fought desperately for their fortress, but before evening the whole place was in the hands of the British. As soon as Sir Colin Campbell reached the Moti Mahal, on the outskirts of the city proper, General Havelock came out from the Residency to meet him, and the second relief was successfully accomplished.\n\nEven now, however, it remained impossible to hold Lucknow, and Sir\nColin Campbell determined, before undertaking any further offensive operations, to return to Cawnpur with his army, escorting the civilians, ladies, and children rescued from their long imprisonment in the Residency, with the view of forwarding them to Calcutta. On the morning of the 20th of November, the troops received orders to March for the Alambagh; and the Residency, the scene of so long and stirring a defence, was abandoned for a while to the rebel army. Before the final departure, Sir Henry Havelock died from an attack of dysentery. He was buried in the Alambagh, without any monument, a cross on a neighbouring tree alone marking for the time his last resting-place.\n\nSir James Outram, with 3500 men, held the Alambagh until the Commander-in-Chief could return to recapture the capital. The rebels used the interval well for the fortification of their stronghold to the utmost extent of their knowledge and power. They surrounded the greater part of the city, for a circuit of 20 miles, with an external line of defences, extending from the G\u00famti to the canal. An earthen parapet lay behind the canal; a second line of earthworks connected the Mot\u00ed Mahal, the Mess-house, and the Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra; while the Kaisar B\u00e1gh constituted the rebel citadel. Stockade works and parapets closed every street; and loopholes in all the houses afforded an opportunity for defending the passage inch by inch. The computed strength of the insurgents amounted to 30,000 Sepoys, together with 50,000 volunteers; and they possessed 100 pieces of ordnance-guns, and mortars.\n\nOn the 2nd of March 1858, Sir Colin Campbell found himself free enough in the rear to march once more upon Lucknow. He first occupied the Dilkusha, and posted guns to command the Martini\u00e8re. On the 5th, Brigadier Franks arrived with 6000 men, half of them G\u00farkhas sent by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Nep\u00e1l. Outram's force then crossed the G\u00famti, and advanced from the direction of Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d), while the main body attacked from the south-east. After a week's hard fighting, from the 9th to the 15th March, the rebels were completely defeated, and their posts captured one by one. Most of the insurgents, however, escaped. As soon as it became clear that Lucknow had been permanently recovered, and that the enemy as a combined body had ceased to exist, Sir Colin Campbell broke up the British Oudh army, and the work of re-organization began. On the 18th of October 1858, the Governor-General and Lady Canning visited Lucknow in state, and found the city already recovering from the devastation to which it had been subjected.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1869 returned the total population of Lucknow, including the cantonments, as 284,779. In 1881, the Census returned the population of the city at 239,773, and the cantonments at 21,530; total, 261,303, showing a decrease of 23,476, or 8\u00b72 per\ncent., in twelve years. Classified according to religion, the population of the city and cantonment stood as follows in 1881:\u2014Hindus, 155,320; Muhammadans, 99,152; Jains, 338; Christians, 6253; and 'others,' 240. Males numbered 139,105, and females 122,198. The European element in the city is unusually large. The Hindus number three-fifths of the population, the K\u00e1yasth and Baniy\u00e1 castes forming a considerable proportion. Many pensioners of the British Government and of the former Oudh kings reside in the city. The Lucknow Musalm\u00e1ns are chiefly Shi\u00e1s, that being the recognised orthodox sect under the Naw\u00e1bs.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The traffic of Oudh flows southward from Bahramgh\u00e1t and Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d through Lucknow to Cawnpur. Large quantities of grain and timber come in from the trans-Gogra Districts, while raw cotton, iron, and imported goods go northward in exchange. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, with its branches, has a station in the town, and gives direct communication with Benares, Bareilly, and Cawnpur, as well as connecting with the Great Trunk lines to Calcutta, Bombay, and the Punjab. The railway has given a great impetus to trade. The chief country imports consist of wheat and other grains, ghi, gur or molasses, sugar, spices, oil-seeds, and tobacco; besides which a large quantity of European piece-goods, etc., are brought into the town.\n\nManufactures are carried on to a considerable extent; the chief products being those which call for the oriental combination of patience, industry, minute manual skill, and delicate taste in the management of colour. Lucknow muslins and other textile fabrics have a high reputation, some 30 small establishments being engaged in this trade. Gold and silver brocade, however, made of small wires, forms the leading manufacture. It is used for the numerous purposes of Indian pomp, and has a considerable market even in Europe. The gorgeous needlework embroidery upon velvet and cotton, with gold thread and coloured silks, also employs many hands. Lucknow jewellery, once very famous, has declined since the departure of the court. Glass-work and moulding in clay still maintain their original excellence. A Kashmiri colony has introduced a small manufacture of shawls. The only enterprise conducted by Europeans is an ice-making concern. The railway workshops, however, employ many hundreds of workmen, including several pupils of the Martini\u00e8re school, besides other Europeans and Eurasians. The principal markets are\u2014the grain markets of Fatehganj and Digbij\u00e1iganj, lying to the west; Rak\u00e1bganj, at the south end of the Canning road; Sa\u00e1datganj, in the south-west; and Sh\u00e1hganj, near the new Victoria road. Imported cotton and salt are set down at Sa\u00e1datganj. Molasses is sold at the Nakhkh\u00e1s market, and leather in the Chikmandi. A paper factory has recently been established in the city.\nAdministration.\u2014Before the amalgamation of Oudh with the North-Western Provinces in 1877, Lucknow formed the residence of the Chief Commissioner and his staff. It is still the head-quarters of the officials whose authority extends over the whole of Oudh. It also forms the Oudh head-quarters of the united Provinces of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, and the residence of the Lieutenant-Governor for a certain period every year. The Judicial Commissioner of Oudh, the Deputy Inspector-General of Police, the Inspector of Education, the Examiner of Public Works Accounts, the Assistant Commissioner of Customs, the Chief Inspector of Post Offices, and the Conservator of Forests have their offices at Lucknow. The central officials of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway likewise have their posts in the city. The municipal police in 1883 consisted of 876 officers and men, together with a force of chaukid\u00e1rs and jamad\u00e1rs, and a cantonment and railway police. Besides the Balr\u00e1mpur hospital, already noticed, Lucknow contains 2 similar charitable institutions, the King's Hospital and the Government Dispensary. A lunatic asylum for the whole Province stands upon the eastern bank of the river, near the Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) road. The municipal revenue in 1870-71 amounted to \u00a320,018, of which \u00a316,230 was derived from octroi. By 1883 the municipal income had increased to \u00a326,119, of which \u00a321,037 was derived from octroi; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 8d. per head of the population (239,773) within municipal limits.\n\nEducation, etc.\u2014Canning College, supported by the idlukd\u00e1rs, and assisted by a grant-in-aid from Government, was established in 1864. It contains five departments, namely, the college, school, oriental, preparatory, and law branches, and is under the management of a committee, with the Commissioner of the Division as President. The Martini\u00e8re College provides education for the sons of soldiers, and has also a girls' school in connection. The American Mission conducts 7 schools, and the English Church Mission 5. Eleven other schools derive support from provincial, municipal, and private funds. The Loretto Convent and 25 other establishments offer education for girls. Lucknow, in spite of its comparative decay, still ranks as the admitted capital of Hindust\u00e1ni music, song, and poetry. The Lucknow native theatres also maintain a high position in native opinion. The subjects for the dramas are largely derived from English life in India.\n\nMilitary Statistics.\u2014Lucknow forms the head-quarters of the Oudh military Division. The cantonment is healthily and well situated, 3 miles east of the city. The garrison usually comprises 3 batteries of British artillery, 1 regiment of British cavalry, 2 of British infantry, 1 of Native cavalry, and 2 of Native infantry. A battery of artillery and a detachment of Native infantry occupy the Mach\u00ed Bhawan fort, and act as a garrison to command the city; but it has been proposed to\ngive up the ancient stronghold and erect a new fort upon some other site.\n\n**Ludhi\u00e1na.**\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between $30^\\circ 33'$ and $31^\\circ 1'$ N. lat., and between $75^\\circ 24' 30\"$ and $76^\\circ 27'$ E. long. Area, 1375 square miles (1881). Population, 618,835 persons. Ludhi\u00e1na is the westernmost District of the Amb\u00e1la (Umballa) Division. It is bounded on the north by the river Sutlej (Satlaj), which separates it from J\u00e1landhar District; on the east by the District of Amb\u00e1la; on the south by the Native States of Pati\u00e1la, Jh\u00ednd, N\u00e1bha, and Maler Kotla; and on the west by the District of Firozpur (Ferozepore). To the north, east, and west, the boundaries are fairly symmetrical, but in the south several outlying villages belonging to Ludhi\u00e1na District are scattered among the Native States mentioned above; while on the other hand, two or three groups of Pati\u00e1la villages in the east are completely surrounded by British territory. Ludhi\u00e1na District is divided into three *tahsils* or Sub-divisions, Samr\u00e1la to the east, Ludhi\u00e1na in the centre, and Jagr\u00e1on to the west. The District stands twenty-ninth in order of area, and fifteenth in order of population among the thirty-two British Districts of the Province, and comprises $1.29$ per cent. of the total area, $3.29$ per cent. of the total population, and $3.40$ per cent. of the urban population of British territory. Notwithstanding its limited area, the District is one of the most important in the Punjab. Excluding the outlying villages, it is probably more compact and convenient for administrative purposes than any other Punjab District, the remotest point being not much more than 30 miles from head-quarters, and access to almost every part being easy by rail, or by good roads which intersect the District in all directions. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Ludhi\u00e1na, which is centrally situated a few miles south of the Sutlej.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The surface of Ludhi\u00e1na consists for the most part of a broad plain, nowhere interrupted by hills or rivers, and stretching northward from the borders of the Native States to the south to the ancient bed of the Sutlej (Satlaj). Its soil is composed of a rich clay, broken by large patches of shifting sand, which has drifted here and there into ridges of considerable height. The distribution of the sand-layer is singularly capricious, so that a distance of only a hundred yards may carry the observer from fertile gardens into the midst of a deep and barren desert. On the eastern edge, towards Ambala (Umballa) and the hills, the soil improves greatly, as the clay is there surmounted by a bed of rich mould, suitable for the cultivation of cotton and sugar-cane; but towards the west, the sand occurs in union with the superficial clay, and forms a light friable soil, on which cereals form the most profitable crop. Even here, however, the earth is so retentive of moisture that good harvests\nare reaped from fields which appear to the eye mere stretches of dry and sandy waste, but are covered, after the autumn rains, by waving sheets of wheat and millet.\n\nThese southern uplands descend to the valley of the Sutlej by an abrupt terrace, which marks the former bed of the river. At its foot lies a half-deserted watercourse, still full at all but the driest seasons, and once the main channel of the Sutlej. Now, however the principal stream has shifted to the opposite side of the valley, leaving a broad alluvial strip of from 2 to 6 miles in width, between its ancient and its modern bed. This region, known as the bet, forms the wider channel of the river, and is partly inundated after heavy rains. It is intersected in every direction by minor watercourses or n\u00e1las, and, being composed of recent alluvium, is for the most part very fertile, though in scattered portions its fruitfulness is destroyed by the occurrence of a deleterious saline efflorescence. The Sutlej itself is navigable for boats of small burden, but its value as a water-way is inconsiderable in this portion of its course. A branch of the Sirhind Canal, recently constructed, enters the District from Ambala (Umballa), and with its two principal branches, irrigates a large part of the western pargan\u00e1s. With this exception, irrigation is almost entirely confined to wells.\n\nLudhi\u00e1na is singularly bare of trees. In the bet are a few well-grown philkans, while pipals and banians are to be found near the village tanks; but as a rule, only a few patches of scrubby dh\u00e1k jungle break the general monotony of the sky-line. Attention, however, has been lately directed to this subject, and avenues of trees are now growing up along the main roads, which will doubtless do something to improve the appearance of this level and arid District. The only mineral product in Ludhi\u00e1na is kankar or nodular limestone, which is quarried in many places for metalling the roads and for burning into lime.\n\nHistory.\u2014Though the present town of Ludhi\u00e1na dates no further back than the 15th century, other cities in the District can claim a much greater antiquity. At Sunet, close to the modern town, are ruins of an extensive brick-built town, whose greatness had already passed away before the period of Muhammadan invasion; and the old Hindu city of M\u00e1chiw\u00e1ra is of still earlier date, being mentioned in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata. During the Musalm\u00e1n epoch, the history of the District is bound up with that of the R\u00e1\u00eds of R\u00e1ikot, a family of converted R\u00e1jputs, who received the country as a fief under the Sayyid dynasty, about the year 1445. The town of Ludhi\u00e1na was founded in 1480 by two of the Lodh\u00ed race (then ruling at Delhi), from whom it derives its name. It was built in great part from the prehistoric bricks of Sunet, still bearing their rude trade-mark in the impression of three human fingers. On the overthrow of the Lodh\u00ed dynasty by B\u00e1bar, the\ntown passed into the hands of the Mughals, with whom it remained till 1760, when the R\u00e1\u00eds of R\u00e1ikot took possession of it.\n\nThroughout the palmy days of the Mughal Empire, the present District was included in the Sark\u00e1r (or Division) of Sirhind, in the Sub\u00e1h (or Province) of Delhi, the western portions being leased to the R\u00e1\u00eds of R\u00e1ikot, who, on the decadence of the empire, asserted their independence and formed a kingdom out of the territories held by them in this and the neighbouring District of Firozpur, the boundaries of which they extended. On the capture of Sirhind by the Sikhs in 1763, the western parts of the District fell into the hands of a number of petty Sikh chiefs. At the close of the 18th century, the R\u00e1ikot family was represented by a minor; and the Sikhs from the other side of the valley commenced a series of attacks upon their possessions. On one occasion, the famous adventurer, George Thomas, was called in to repel them. Finally, in 1806, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranjit Singh crossed the Sutlej on his first expedition against the cis-Sutlej chiefs, and stripped the R\u00e1\u00eds of their possessions, leaving only a couple of villages for the maintenance of two widows, who, with the exception of the minor chief, were the only remaining representatives of the ruling family.\n\nIn 1809, after Ranjit Singh's third invasion, a treaty was concluded between him and the British Government, by which his further conquests were stopped, although he was allowed to retain all territories acquired in his first two expeditions. At the same time, all the cis-Sutlej States that had not been absorbed were taken under British protection. In the same year (1809) a cantonment for British troops was placed at Ludhi\u00e1na, compensation being made to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jh\u00ednd in whose possession it then was. In 1835, on the failure of the direct line of the Jhind family, a tract of country around Ludhi\u00e1na came into British possession by lapse, and this formed the nucleus of the present District.\n\nOn the conclusion of the first Sikh war in 1846, Ludhi\u00e1na District assumed very nearly its present limits by the additions of territory annexed from the Lahore Government and its adherents on this side of the valley. Since the British occupation, the town has grown in wealth and population, but its history has been happily marked by few noticeable events of any sort. The cantonment was abandoned in 1854. During the Mutiny in 1857, an unsuccessful attempt was made by the Deputy Commissioner of the District, with the assistance of a small force, to stop the J\u00e1landhar rebellious Sepoys on their way to Delhi. In 1872, an outbreak by a fanatical sect of Kuk\u00e1s attempted to disturb the peace of the country; but it was at once suppressed, and its leader, R\u00e1m Singh, deported from India, and sent as a State prisoner to British Burma. The more peaceful events to be chronicled are the opening of the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway, and the opening of the\nSirhind Canal. Since the first Afgh\u00e1n war (1839-42), Ludhi\u00e1na town has been the residence of the exiled royal family of Shah Shuj\u00e1.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The first enumeration of the people was that of 1855, which returned the total number of inhabitants at 527,722, or 388 to the square mile. These figures, however, are suspected of being slightly in excess of the real numbers. A second Census was taken in 1868, over an area corresponding to the present District, which returned a total population of 585,547, or 426 per square mile. In 1881 the population had further increased to 618,835, namely, by 33,288, or 5\u00b77 per cent., during the thirteen years ending 1881. The general results of the Census of 1881 may be briefly summarized as follows:\u2014Area, 1375 square miles, with 6 towns and 853 villages, 104,231 houses, and 141,719 families. Total population, 618,835, namely, males 339,598, and females 279,237; proportion of males, 54\u00b79 per cent. From these data the following averages can be obtained:\u2014Persons per square mile, 450; villages per square mile, 0\u00b762; persons per village, 725; houses per square mile, 98; persons per house, 5\u00b79. Classified according to age, the Census returned\u2014under 15 years, males 126,501, and females 100,091; total children, 226,592, or 36\u00b76 per cent. of the population: 15 years and upwards, males 213,097, and females 179,146; total adults, 392,243, or 63\u00b74 per cent.\n\nAs regards religious distinctions, Hindus number 275,240 persons, or 44\u00b74 per cent.; Muhammadans, 213,954, or 34\u00b76 per cent.; Sikhs, 127,143, or 20\u00b76 per cent.; Jains, 2165; Christians, 322; and \u2018others,\u2019 11. In the ethnical classification of the inhabitants, the J\u00e1ts rank first both in number (222,665) and in agricultural importance; they form one-third of the whole population, and nearly two-thirds of the cultivating class. As a race, the J\u00e1ts are patient, laborious, and enterprising. They are evenly distributed over the whole District, with the exception of the Sutlej valley, where they are comparatively few in number. In religion, the great majority of J\u00e1ts are Hindus or Sikhs. The R\u00e1jputs come next, with 30,957 persons; they are almost exclusively Musalm\u00e1ns. The G\u00fajars number 30,759, and cluster thickly in the fertile strip by the bank of the Sutlej. Though they hold the richest portion of the District, they are here as elsewhere careless and improvident cultivators, and ill fitted for any but a predatory r\u00e9gime. Most of them are Musalm\u00e1ns in creed. The Br\u00e1hmans muster strong, numbering 25,121, but their social importance is small. The mercantile classes are represented by 15,944 Khattris and 8722 Baniy\u00e1s. There are also 2492 Kashmir\u00eds, chiefly confined to the town of Ludhi\u00e1na, where they are employed in weaving shawls and woollen goods.\n\n**Town and Rural Population.**\u2014The District contained 4 towns\nin 1881 with a population exceeding 5000\u2014namely, Ludhiana, 44,163; Jagraon, 16,873; Raikot, 9219; and Machiwara, 5967. Two other places are returned as municipal towns, but with a less population than 5000, namely, Khanna, 3988; and Bahlolpur, 2842. These six towns have an aggregate population of 83,052 persons, or 13.4 per cent. of the total District population. Of the 859 towns and villages in the District, 140 are returned as having less than two hundred inhabitants; 318 from two to five hundred; 243 from five hundred to a thousand; 119 from one to two thousand; 21 from two to three thousand; 4 from three to five thousand; and 4 between five and fifty thousand inhabitants. As regards occupation, the adult male population in 1881 was divided into the following seven classes:\u2014(1) Professional and official class, 8978; (2) domestic and menial class, 8147; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 3031; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 117,628; (5) industrial and manufacturing class, including artisans, 41,941; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, 22,646; (7) occupations not specified, 10,735. Panjabi is the language of the rural communities, but Urdu is spoken in the towns, and is generally understood by the peasantry.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014In spite of the unpromising appearance of its soil, Ludhi\u00e1na is a flourishing agricultural District, a result which must be largely attributed to the untiring diligence of its J\u00e1t cultivators. Almost all the available land has been brought under the plough, and in many villages no waste ground is left for pasturage, the cattle being fed from cultivated produce. Of a total area in 1883\u201384 of 881,738 acres, 731,388 acres, or 82.9 per cent., were returned as under cultivation, of which 115,321 acres were irrigated, entirely by private enterprise. Of the remaining area, 11,085 acres were grazing land, 67,928 acres were still available for cultivation, and only 71,337 acres uncultivable waste. Cereals are chiefly grown in the western part of the District, while sugar-cane and cotton can be raised on the richer soil of the eastern parg\u00e1ns. The area under each principal crop in 1883\u201384 was estimated as follows:\u2014Rabi or spring crops\u2014wheat, 177,644 acres; barley, 23,895 acres; gram, 121,286 acres; masur, 386 acres; tobacco, 1057 acres. Kharif or rain crops\u2014j\u00f3\u00e1r, 75,393 acres; Indian corn, 53,914 acres; moth, 50,525 acres; rice, 2683 acres; m\u00fcng, 5004 acres; mash, 3610 acres; cotton, 16,408 acres; hemp, 2853 acres; and sugar-cane, 14,109 acres. The rabi or spring harvest is ordinarily sown from the middle of September to the middle of November, and reaped from the middle of April to the middle of May. The kharif or autumn crops, except sugar-cane and cotton which have special seasons, are sown in July and August, and reaped about the end of October. Until the opening of the Sirhind canal,\nirrigation was confined to the leathern bucket; and the painstaking toil of the J\u0101ts in watering their arid fields is beyond all praise. Wells are held in shares by the villagers, each proprietor being permitted to draw water for a certain number of hours out of the twenty-four, in proportion to the share to which he is hereditarily entitled; and the labour of watering never ceases by day or by night. The use of manure is thoroughly appreciated. This account, however, refers only to the general upland plain. The bet or valley of the Sutlej is but poorly tilled by its R\u0101jput proprietors; and the scattered British villages, which lie isolated among the native territory to the south, can obtain no water except at such depths below the surface as render it practically unavailable.\n\nThe Muhammadan portion of the peasantry are for the most part involved in debt, from which the Hindu J\u0101ts are, as a rule, free. Most of the villages are held in pattid\u0101r\u012b tenure, the land having been originally distributed by shares, which are still easily recognisable. Upwards of 80 per cent. of the land is cultivated by the proprietors themselves. Rents vary with the nature and capabilities of the soil; land fit for sugar-cane or tobacco fetches \u00a31, 4s. 8d. per acre, irrigated wheat lands bring in from 11s. to 18s., and dry lands from 7s. to 12s. Agricultural labourers are paid in grain; cash wages prevail in the towns, at the rate of from 4d. to 4\u00bdd. per diem. Prices in 1883 ruled as follows:\u2014Wheat, 25 sers per rupee, or 4s. 6d. per cwt.; Indian corn, 38 sers per rupee, or 3s. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 40 sers per rupee, or 2s. 10d. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Ludhi\u00e1na is comparatively free from the pressing danger of famine, though it suffers much from drought. The Settlement Officer is of opinion that no continuance of bad seasons would in any human probability necessitate an importation of grain. Prices may vary from very low rates to famine quotations, but the produce of the District would suffice for home consumption, even under the most trying circumstances. The town of Ludhi\u00e1na is now one of the principal entrep\u00f4ts for the grain trade of the Punjab, and the communications by rail, road, and river would be sufficient in the last resort to avert the extremity of famine.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The exports of Ludhi\u00e1na are chiefly confined to its raw material, including grain, cotton, wool, saltpetre, and indigo; the principal imports are English goods, spices, and the red madder dye, which are brought up the Sutlej to the gh\u0101t opposite Ludhi\u00e1na. Besides the chief town, Jagr\u00e1on, Raikot, and M\u00e1chiw\u00e1r\u0101 are centres of local trade. The total annual value of the exports for the whole District is estimated at \u00a3377,120; that of the imports at \u00a3365,552. The manufactures are by no means inconsiderable, including shawls, pashmina cloth, stockings, gloves, cotton goods, furniture, carriages, and fire-arms. Two branches of the weaving\nindustry are carried on\u2014(1) Woollen, consisting for the most part in the manufacture of the fine cloth known as *pashmina*, R\u00e1mpur *chad\u00e1rs*, etc.; (2) cotton, including *gabr\u00edn* (the \u2018Ludhi\u00e1na cloth\u2019 of commerce), *khes*, *lung\u00eds*, and the like. These industries give employment to about three thousand hands, mostly working at single looms. There are several metalled roads in Ludhi\u00e1na, including a portion of the Grand Trunk Road; total length of roads, 346 miles. The Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway passes through the centre of the District, for a distance of 36 miles, with stations at Khanna, S\u00e1hew\u00e1l, and Ludhi\u00e1na. Its opening has given a great impetus to the grain trade, which is now concentrated in the town of Ludhi\u00e1na. The Sutlej affords navigable water communication for 53 miles. The District has 6 printing-presses, the most important of which are at the American Presbyterian Mission and at the jail; the others belong to native proprietors.\n\n**Administration.**\u2014The administrative staff of Ludhi\u00e1na comprises a Deputy Commissioner, with an Assistant and 2 extra-Assistants, a Judge of the Small Cause Court, and 3 *tahs\u00edld\u00e1rs*, besides the usual medical and constabulary officers. The total revenue in 1872\u201373 amounted to \u00a3103,795, of which \u00a385,215, or about four-fifths, was contributed by the land-tax. In 1883\u201384, the total revenue was returned at \u00a3127,659, of which \u00a392,700, or over three-fourths, was derived from the land-tax. The other principal items of revenue are stamps and local rates. The incidence of the land revenue per acre is heavier than in any other District of the Punjab, but the collections are made without difficulty.\n\nFor police purposes, the District is divided into 10 police circles (*th\u00e1n\u00e1s*). The imperial police force amounted in 1883 to 439 officers and men, besides a municipal establishment of 101 constables. These are supplemented by a force of 796 village watchmen (*chaukid\u00e1rs*), who keep watch and ward in the villages of the District, and in all the towns except Ludhi\u00e1na itself. The aggregate machinery for the protection of persons and property accordingly consisted of 1336 persons, being 1 policeman to every 1\u00b703 square mile of the area and every 463 of the population. The number of persons brought to trial for all offences, great or small, committed in Ludhi\u00e1na during the year 1883 was 2206, or 1 in every 280 inhabitants. In 1883, the daily average number of prisoners in the District jail was 285.\n\nEducation has made great advances during the last ten years. In 1873 there were 184 schools, of which 68 were in receipt of Government aid; the pupils numbered 6733, and the sum expended upon instruction from the public funds amounted to \u00a31353. In 1883\u201384 the number of schools under Government inspection was 99, attended by 4966 pupils, exclusive of a reported number of 388 indigenous uninspected village schools in 1882\u201383, with 4364 pupils.\nThe District is sub-divided into 3 tahsils and 19 pargan\u00e1s, owned by 83,067 shareholders. Municipalities have been established at Ludhi\u00e1na, Jagr\u00e1on, R\u00e1ikot, M\u00e1chiw\u00e1r\u00e1, Khanna, and Bhilolpur. The aggregate revenue of these six towns amounted in 1871-72 to \u00a33277. In 1883-84, the income of the above municipalities had increased to \u00a38934, the average incidence of taxation being 2s. 1\u00bed. per head.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014In the upland portion of the District the atmosphere is dry and healthy, being free from the malarious effluvia which are so general a cause of febrile disorders on the plains of India. In the Sutlej valley, however, the network of watercourses renders the air extremely noxious after the floods of the rainy season, and deaths from fever are frequent, often assuming an epidemic form. The temperature varies from intense heat in the summer months to comparatively severe cold in December and January. In 1883, in the month of May, the mean temperature was returned at 90\u00b0 3' F., the maximum being 114\u00b0 3', and the minimum 68\u00b0 3'. In July, the mean temperature was 89\u00b0 4', with a maximum of 112\u00b0 8', and a minimum of 74\u00b0 3'. In December, the mean temperature was 56\u00b0 0', with a maximum of 73\u00b0 7', and a minimum of 35\u00b0 8'. The average annual rainfall for the twenty-five years ending in 1881 is returned at 28\u00b0 17 inches. In 1883 the total rainfall was 39\u00b0 6 inches, of which 26\u00b0 5 inches fell between June and September. The total number of deaths recorded in 1883 amounted to 14,628, or 24 per thousand; of which 8487 were assigned to fever. Ophthalmia is of common occurrence, owing to the quantity of sand-dust with which the atmosphere is laden during the prevalence of dry winds. There are 3 Government charitable dispensaries in the District, from which 38,005 patients obtained assistance in 1883. [For further information regarding Ludhi\u00e1na, see the Gazetteer of Ludhi\u00e1na District, to be published by the authority of the Punjab Government in the course of the present year (1885); also Report on the Revised Settlement of Ludhi\u00e1na District, by Mr. H.

Area, 678 square miles. Population (1881) 307,559, namely, males 169,139, and females 138,420; average density of population, 453 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 130,478; Sikhs, 63,633; Muhammadans, 111,942; and 'others,' 1506. Total revenue, \u00a337,497. The administrative staff, including the District officers, consists of a Deputy Commissioner, with a judicial assistant, 3 Assistant Commissioners, 1 tahsild\u00e1r, 2 munisfs, and 5 honorary magistrates. These officers pre-\nside over 11 civil and 11 criminal courts. Number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 5; strength of regular police, 226 men; village watchmen (chaukidd\u00e1rs), 399.\n\n**Ludhi\u00e1na.**\u2014Town, municipality, and administrative head-quarters of Ludhi\u00e1na District, Punjab. Lat. 30\u00b0 55' 25\" N., long. 75\u00b0 53' 30\" E. Situated on the high south bank of the Sutlej (Satlaj), 8 miles from the present bed of the river. Railway station on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway. The town stands on low ground, with some large open streets, but a greater number of small and tortuous alleys. The fort lies to the north of the town on an open and detached space, cleared after the Mutiny. Ludhi\u00e1na town contained in 1868 a population of 39,983, which had increased by 1881 to 44,163, namely, males 24,685, and females 19,478. Muhammadans number 29,045; Hindus, 12,969; Sikhs, 1077; Jains, 752; and 'others,' 320. Number of houses, 7041. Municipal income (1875-76), \u00a33193; (1883-84), \u00a36675, or an average of 3s. per head.\n\nLudhi\u00e1na was founded in 1480 by Yusaf and Nihang, princes of the Lodh\u00ed family, then reigning at Delhi. In 1760 it fell into the hands of the R\u00e1\u00eds of R\u00e1ikot, who held it until the end of the last century, when Ranj\u00edt Singh expelled them, and made over the town to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bh\u00e1g Singh of Jh\u00ednd. In 1809, General Ochterlony occupied it as Political Agent for the cis-Sutlej States, at first only as a temporary cantonment; but Government afterwards compensated the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jh\u00ednd for the loss, and when the territory lapsed in 1834, retained the town as a military station. The troops were removed in 1854, but a small detachment continued to garrison the fort. The shrine of a Muhammadan saint, Shaikh Abdul K\u00e1dir-i-Jal\u00e1ni, yearly attracts an important religious gathering, frequented by Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns alike.\n\nThe Muhammadan element preponderates strongly in the city, owing to the large number of Kashmir\u00ed and Path\u00e1n settlers, the latter being followers of the exiled royal family of K\u00e1b\u00fal, whose head, Sh\u00e1hz\u00e1da Sh\u00e1hpur, resides at Ludhi\u00e1na as a pensioner of the British Government. The Kashmir\u00eds retain their hereditary skill as weavers of shawls and pash-m\u00edna cloth, the value of the quantity exported in 1883 being estimated at \u00a315,000. Shawls of the soft R\u00e1mpur wool, cotton cloths, scarves, turbans, furniture, and carriages also form large items in the thriving trade of the town. Since the opening of the railway, Ludhi\u00e1na has become a great central grain mart, having extensive export transactions both with the north and south. The public buildings include the fort, District court-house, and Small Cause Court, railway station, tahs\u00edli, police station, dak bungalow, sar\u00e1i, jail, and Government charitable dispensary. The American Presbyterian Mission has a church and school, with a small colony of native Christians. The town bears a bad reputation for unhealthiness.\nLugh\u00e1si.\u2014One of the Native States in Bundelkhand, under the Central India Agency and the Government of India. It is bounded on the south-west, south, and south-east by the Chhatarpur State, and on all other sides by Hamirpur District. When the British Government assumed supremacy in Bundelkhand, the ancestor of the present chief was found in possession of 11 villages, the title over which was confirmed to him on his executing the usual deed of allegiance. During the Mutiny in 1857, the chief, Sard\u00e1r Singh, was loyal to the British Government, although half of the villages of Lugh\u00e1si were laid waste by the rebels in consequence of his fidelity. In reward for his services, Sard\u00e1r Singh received the title of R\u00e1o Bah\u00e1dur, a j\u00e1s\u00edr of \u00a3200 a year, a dress of honour, and the privilege of adoption, which was afterwards confirmed by sanad. The present chief, R\u00e1o Bah\u00e1dur Khet Singh, grandson of Sard\u00e1r Singh, is a Bundela Hindu, and was born about 1856. Area of the State, 47.2 square miles, with 12 villages and 936 houses. Population (1881) 6159, namely, Hindus, 6010; Muhammadans, 132; Jains, 5; and aboriginal tribes, 12. Estimated revenue, \u00a31000. The military force consists of 7 guns with 4 gunners, and 90 infantry. The State contains a good school and several roads, which were constructed during the time when it was under direct British management during the minority of the present chief. The town of Lugh\u00e1si, with a fort and good b\u00e1z\u00e1r, is situated on the route from K\u00e1lpi to Jabalpur (Jubbulpore), 86 miles south of the former, and 183 miles north of the latter. Population (1881) 2167.\n\nLugu.\u2014Detached hill south of the central plateau of Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 46' 45\" N., long. 85\u00b0 44' 30\" E. A natural fortress, forming a remarkable feature in this District. The northern face has a bold scarp of 2200 feet in height; and the highest point is 3203 feet above the sea.\n\nLuk\u00e1 (or Luba).\u2014River in Assam, which is fed by several streams rising in the hills forming the south-eastern corner of the Jaintia Hill and the south-eastern corner of North Cachar; after flowing south-west through the Jaintia Hills, it falls into the main stream of the Surma, near the market village of Mul\u00e1ghul in Sylhet District.\n\nLukman-jo-Tando.\u2014Town in Khairpur State, Sind, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See TANDO LUKMAN.\n\nLumbaiong.\u2014Mountain range in the Kh\u00e1si Hills, Assam; highest peak, 4646 feet above sea-level.\n\nLun\u00e1w\u00e1ra.\u2014Native State under the Political Agency of Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha in the Province of Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency. Bounded on the north by Dungarpur State, one of the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na chiefships; on the east by S\u00fanth and Kad\u00e1na States of Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha; on the south by the Godhra Sub-division of the British District of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls; and on the west by Edar State (M\u00e1hi K\u00e1ntha) and B\u00e1lasinor (Rew\u00e1\nK\u00e1ntha). The State is situated between $22^\\circ 50'$ and $23^\\circ 16'$ N. lat., and between $73^\\circ 21'$ and $73^\\circ 47'$ E. long. Area, 388 square miles. Population (1872) 74,813; (1881) 75,450, occupying 1 town and 165 villages, containing 15,966 houses. Hindus numbered 71,870; Muhammadans, 3059; and 'others,' 521. Density of population, 194.4 persons per square mile. Lun\u00e1w\u00e1ra is irregular in shape, and has many outlying villages, the territory being much intermixed with that of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor and with the British Panch Mah\u00e1ls. The extreme length from north to south is 34 miles, and the extreme breadth from east to west 25 miles. About one-third of the State has been alienated, some lands having been granted in free gift, and others on service or other tenures. The soil is generally stony, the hills are low and scantily covered with timber. Irrigation is chiefly from wells; though there are many reservoirs, and the river Mahi flows through the territory. The climate is perhaps somewhat cooler than in the neighbouring parts of Gujar\u00e1t. The prevailing disease is fever. Cereals and timber are the chief products. A well-frequented route, between Gujar\u00e1t and M\u00e1lw\u00e1, passes through Lun\u00e1w\u00e1ra.\n\nUntil 1825, the State was under the Political Agency of M\u00e1hi K\u00e1ntha. The Chief is descended from the R\u00e1jput dynasty that ruled at Anhilw\u00e1ra P\u00e1tan, and his ancestors are said to have established themselves at Virpur in 1225. In 1434, the family removed to Lun\u00e1w\u00e1ra, having in all probability been driven across the Mahi by the increasing power of the Muhammadan kings of Gujar\u00e1t. Lun\u00e1w\u00e1ra was tributary both to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r and to Sindhia; the rights of the latter ruler, guaranteed by the British Government in 1819, were transferred by him with the cession of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls District in 1861. The present (1884) chief, M\u00e1h\u00e1r\u00e1na Wakh\u00e1t Singhji, a Hindu of the Solanki R\u00e1jput caste, was educated at the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r College at R\u00e1jkot, and was installed in August 1880. He is entitled to a salute of 9 guns, and has power to try his own subjects only for capital offences, without the express permission of the Political Agent. He enjoys an estimated gross yearly revenue of \u00a316,216, and pays a tribute of \u00a31800 jointly to the British Government and the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda; military force, 204 men. The family hold no title authorizing adoption, but they follow the rule of primogeniture. There were, in 1882-83, 12 schools, with a total of 842 pupils. Something has been done towards abolishing transit duties.\n\nLun\u00e1w\u00e1ra.\u2014Capital of Lun\u00e1w\u00e1ra State, Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency; a fortified town, situated in lat. $23^\\circ 8' 30''$ N., and long. $73^\\circ 39' 30''$ E., about 4 miles east of the confluence of the Mahi and Pan\u00e1m rivers, and a mile north of the latter stream. Population (1881) 9059, of whom 6488 were Hindus; 2248 Muhammadans; 320 Jains; and 3 'others.' The town was founded by R\u00e1n\u00e1 Bh\u00edm\nSinghji in 1434. According to the local legend, the chief one day went hunting across the Mahi, and, having become accidentally separated from his companions, found himself near the hut of a s\u00e1dhu or ascetic. He presented himself before the recluse, saluted him reverentially, and remained standing until bidden to be seated. The s\u00e1dhu was pleased with his demeanour, and, auguring a great future for him and his descendants, advised him to build a city in the forest. He told him to proceed in an easterly direction, and to mark the point where a hare would cross his path. The R\u00e1n\u00e1 did as directed; a hare soon jumping out of a bush. The R\u00e1n\u00e1 pursued and killed it with a spear, and marked the spot, which, it is said, is now within the precincts of the palace. The s\u00e1dhu was a devotee of the god Lunesw\u00e1r, in honour of whom the R\u00e1n\u00e1 called the town Lunaw\u00e1ra. The shrine of the god still stands outside the Dark\u00fali gate. About the beginning of the 19th century the town was a flourishing centre for traffic between M\u00e1lw\u00e1 and central Gujar\u00e1t. Its artisans were remarkable for their skill; and a brisk trade in arms and accoutrements went on. Jail, school, and dispensary. A road has been constructed to Shera, a British village, 15 miles north of Godhra, the terminus of the Godhra branch of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway. The produce of the State will find a ready market at Godhra.\n\nLush\u00e1i (or Kuki) Hills.\u2014A wild and imperfectly known tract of country on the north-east frontier of India, extending along the southern border of the Assam District of Cachar and the eastern border of the Bengal District of Chittagong. On the east, the Lush\u00e1i Hills stretch away into the unexplored mountains of Independent Burma. This extensive region is occupied by a numerous family of tribes, who are known to us indifferently as Lush\u00e1is or Kukis. The name \u2018Kuki\u2019 is found in early records of the last century, and is still commonly applied to those colonies who have crossed the frontier and settled within British territory; but the appellation of \u2018Lush\u00e1i\u2019 has won official recognition since the Lush\u00e1i expedition of 1871\u201372. Among themselves these tribes are known by a variety of names, sometimes derived from that of their prominent chiefs. The most northerly tribe in the mountains between the State of Manipur and the Nag\u00e1 Hills is known as the Quoireings. South of these are the Kup\u00fa\u00ed, who are subjects of Manipur. The mountains south of Cachar are occupied by the Lush\u00e1is proper, under three principal chiefs. On the frontier of Chittagong, the three best known clans are the Haulongs, the Sylus, and the Thanglowas. All these tribes are nomadic in their habits, and subject to successive waves of migration. It is said that at the present time the entire race of the Lush\u00e1is is being forced southwards into British territory, under pressure from the Soktis, who are advancing upon them from Independent Burma.\nThe principal characteristic common to all the Lush\u00e1is, in which they markedly differ from the other tribes on the Assam frontier, is their feudal organization under hereditary chiefs. Each village is under the military command of a chief or lal, who must come of a certain royal stock, but who exercises his authority by the voluntary submission of his subjects, as the number of his followers depends upon the success which attends his border forays. The chief exercises absolute power in the village; and his dignity and wealth are maintained by a large number of slaves, and by fixed contributions of labour from his free subjects. Like all other hill tribes, the Lush\u00e1is cultivate rice and a few more scanty crops on clearings in the jungle, according to the jum or nomadic system of agriculture; but their main occupation is hunting and warfare. Their domestic animals are the gay\u00e1l or wild cow, the hill goat, and the pig. The gay\u00e1l is not kept for agriculture or for milking, but only for slaughter at solemn sacrifices. Women are held in some sort of estimation, though they perform the whole burden of both in-door and out-door life. They are skilled at weaving a peculiar kind of rug or p\u00fari, which forms to some extent an article of export. The other articles which the Lush\u00e1is bring down to the markets on the plains are caoutchouc, ivory, raw cotton, and beeswax, in exchange for which they take away rice, salt, tobacco, brass-ware, cloth, and silver. Both sexes wear a homespun sheet of cotton cloth, which is generally dyed blue. The women distend the lobes of their ears to an enormous extent with discs of wood or ivory. The average height of the men is about 5 feet 8 inches. They are described as well made and wonderfully muscular, but of a sulky and forbidding cast of countenance.\n\nFrom the earliest times, the Lush\u00e1is have been notorious for their sanguinary raids into British territory, which are said to be instigated by their desire to obtain human heads for use at their funeral ceremonies. The Districts of Cachar, Sylhet, Tipperah, and Chittagong, and the States of Manipur and Hill Tipperah, have repeatedly suffered from these raids. The first of which we have record was in 1777, under the Governor-Generalship of Warren Hastings, when the Chief of Chittagong requested the presence of a detachment of sepoys 'for the protection of the inhabitants against the Kukis.' In 1849, a colony of Lush\u00e1is, settled within the frontier of Cachar, was attacked by their independent kinsmen, and forced to migrate northwards across the Bar\u00e1k river, where they now live as peaceable British subjects, and are known as 'Old Kukis.' In 1860, a raid was made upon the District of Tipperah, in which 186 Beng\u00e1li villagers were massacred and 100 carried away into captivity. Retributive expeditions, consisting of small forces of sepoys, were repeatedly sent to punish these raids; but, owing to the difficult nature of the country\nand the fugitive tactics of the enemy, no permanent advantage was gained.\n\nAt last, the disturbed state of the frontier attracted the attention of the supreme Government. A military demonstration in 1869 had entirely failed in its object. Relying upon their belief in the impracticable character of their native country, the Lush\u00e1\u00eds made a series of simultaneous attacks in January 1871 upon British villages in Cachar, Sylhet, and Tipperah, as well as on the independent State of Manipur. In Cachar a party of Haulongs surprised the tea-garden of Alexandra-pur. The tea-planter was killed, and his daughter, Mary Winchester, was carried off as a hostage. The outpost of Monierkh\u00e1l repelled a number of attacks, lasting through two days, made by a second body of Lush\u00e1\u00eds from the eastern tribes, who finally retired with a large amount of plunder, including many coolies and guns. Lord Mayo, who was then Viceroy, resolved to make a vigorous effort to stop these inroads once and for all.\n\nThe details of a punitive expedition were organized under the immediate control of Lord Napier, the Commander-in-Chief. The little army was composed of 2 Gurkh\u00e1 battalions, 2 regiments of Punjab and 2 of Bengal Native infantry, with 2 companies of Sappers and Miners, and a strong detachment of the Peshawar Mountain Battery. This was divided into two columns. One was to advance from Cachar under General Bourchier, with Mr. Edgar as Political Agent; the other, commanded by General Brownlow, and accompanied by Captain Lewin as Political Officer, was to operate from Chittagong against the Haulong tribes. The Cachar column started from Silch\u00e1r in November 1871, and entered the Lush\u00e1i Hills at Tip\u00e1i-mukh. From that point it advanced for about 110 miles southward through country previously unexplored, encountering considerable resistance from the enemy. Finally, the Lush\u00e1i chiefs accepted the terms imposed upon them. The return march was effected without firing a shot, and Tip\u00e1i-mukh was regained in the beginning of March 1872. The operations of the Chittagong column were equally successful. It penetrated northwards for about 83 miles. The surveying staff that accompanied it triangulated an area of 3000 square miles, and completed the connection between the Districts of Chittagong and Cachar. Fifteen powerful chiefs tendered their personal submission; Mary Winchester was recovered, and upwards of 100 British subjects were liberated from captivity. The actual loss in fighting was small, but a large number both of soldiers and camp followers died from cholera.\n\nSince the date of this expedition, the Lush\u00e1\u00eds have, on the whole, remained quiet along the entire frontier. At the same time active measures have been taken to open commercial intercourse between them and the people of the plains. On the Cachar side, 3 b\u00e1z\u00e1srs have\nbeen established\u2014at Tip\u00e1i-mukh, Lush\u00e1i-h\u00e1t, and Jhaluachar\u00e1\u2014each at the point where a river has its exit from the hills. Trade by barter is briskly carried on, and the Lush\u00e1i chiefs frequently send down friendly messages. It has been estimated that the annual value of the business done at these three marts is about \u00a310,000. On the Chittagong frontier, similar b\u00e1z\u00e1rs have been opened at Dem\u00e1giri, Kasalang, and R\u00e1ng\u00e1m\u00e1ti. Although the Lush\u00e1i expedition of 1871-72 was undoubtedly a sharp measure of retribution, its policy has been entirely justified by the result.\n\nIn November 1883, disturbances occurred on the Chittagong Hills frontier, two boats containing sepoys being attacked on the R\u00e1ng\u00e1m\u00e1ti river above Barkal, in which a sepoy and a servant boy were shot, and a second sepoy drowned. The boats were plundered of money and clothes, and the raiders retreated, pursued by men of a friendly village. The raid is supposed to have been committed by the Shendus, instigated thereto by the Sylus, with the object of throwing suspicion on their enemies, the Haulongs. The information, however, was too vague to justify retaliatory measures; and no further action was taken beyond strengthening the outposts, and distributing a few muskets with ammunition to the friendly villages to enable them to defend themselves against the hostile tribes. A darbar or public reception and a mel\u00ed or fair, held by the Deputy Commissioner of the Chittagong Hill Tracts at R\u00e1ng\u00e1m\u00e1ti in January 1884, proved very successful, although the two principal Haulong chiefs refused to appear. Rumours of intended raids along the Assam and Chittagong frontier were current till the end of January 1884; but on the frontier police being reinforced, the excitement gradually died out, and no disturbances have occurred since.

In December 1867, Captain Hebbert was mortally wounded here when leading an attack against the V\u00e1gher outlaws led by Deo M\u00e1nik. Captain La\nTouche also was shot dead during the assault. The two officers lie buried in a small enclosure near Macharda. A pillar is erected in memory of the fight on Tobar hill, a small hill in the lands of the village. A tablet in R\u00e1jgot church also commemorates the event. Population of village (1881) 340.\n\n**Mach\u00e1ri.**\u2014Village in Alwar (Ulwur) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; situated in lat. 27\u00b0 15' N., and long. 76\u00b0 42' E.; 76 miles south-west of Mathura (Muttra), 3 north-east of R\u00e1jgarh. Mach\u00e1ri was the residence of Sher Sh\u00e1h's famous waz\u00edr Hemu, and was only captured by Akbar's troops after a fierce resistance. It was occupied by R\u00e1o Anand Singh, son of R\u00e1o Kali\u00e1n Singh, the ancestor of the Alwar family, about 1671; and was the head-quarters of the family until the acquisition of the fort of Alwar in 1775.

It joins the Dev\u00ed river in lat. 20\u00b0 3' N., and long. 86\u00b0 17' E. Total length of the main canal, 53 miles.\n\n**Machhl\u00edg\u00e1on.**\u2014Village in Gonda District, Oudh. Population, chiefly Hindus. A famous temple dedicated to Karhuan\u00e1th Mah\u00e1deo is situated near the village, and a considerable fair is held every year on the occasion of the S\u00edvar\u00e1tr\u00ed festival.\n\n**Machhl\u00edshahr.**\u2014South-western *tahsil* of Jaunpur District, North-Western Provinces, lying for the most part south of the river G\u00famt\u00ed, and consisting of *parg\u00e1ns* Gh\u00eds\u00e1wa, M\u00fangra, B\u00e1dsh\u00e1hpur, and Garw\u00e1ra. The *tahsil* is triangular in shape, and is intersected by the Sai and Bhadohi rivers in a south and south-easterly direction, while the Barma forms its southern boundary. The principal line of communication is the metalled road from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d to Jaunpur, besides a number of unmetalled cross-country roads. Rice forms the principal crop in the low-lying land of M\u00fangra and Gh\u00eds\u00e1wa *parg\u00e1ns*. Population (1872)\n192,113; (1881) 238,759, namely, males 120,797, and females 117,962. Total increase in nine years, 46,646, or 24\u00b72 per cent. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 219,953; Muhammadans, 18,800; and Christians, 6. Of the 606 inhabited villages, 435 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; and two towns, Machhlishahr and Mungra Badshahpur, have upwards of five thousand inhabitants. Of the total adult population, 1552 are returned as landholders, 68,286 as agriculturists, and 7150 as engaged in occupations other than agriculture. Total area, according to the latest official statement (1881), 353 square miles, of which 344\u00b79 square miles are assessed for Government revenue. Of the assessed area, 195\u00b73 square miles are returned as cultivated, 55\u00b72 square miles as cultivable, and 94\u00b74 square miles as uncultivable waste. Land revenue, \u00a328,239, or including local rates and cesses levied on land, \u00a332,706. Amount of rent, including cesses, paid by cultivators, \u00a345,487. In 1883 the tahsil contained 1 court, 5 police stations, with a regular police of 81 men, and a village watch or rural police of 511 chaukidars.\n\nMachhl\u00edshahr.\u2014Town in Jaunpur District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Machhl\u00edshahr tahsil. Situated on the metalled road to Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, 18 miles west-south-west of Jaunpur town, in lat. 25\u00b0 41' 10\" N., and long. 82\u00b0 27' 16\" E. The ancient name of the town was Ghisw\u00e1, derived from the name of the Bhar chief Ghisu, who is said to have ruled the pargan\u00e1, and founded the town. It is situated in the midst of a low-lying damp tract of country, and its present name of Machhl\u00edshahr, or 'City of Fishes,' was given to it owing to its liability to floods during the rainy season. The original inhabitants of the town were Bhars, who were expelled during the R\u00e1jput invasions. The R\u00e1jputs were ousted in their turn by the Musalm\u00e1ns, and the place has ever since been a Muhammadan town. Population (1872) 8715; (1881) 9200, namely, Muhammadans, 4762; Hindus, 4432; and Christians, 6. Area of town site, 522 acres. The town was formerly of considerably more importance than at present.
