HUNTER, C.S.I., C.I.E., LL.D.,\nDIRECTOR-GENERAL OF STATISTICS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.\n\nVOLUME VII.\n\nINDORE TO KARDONG.\n\nSECOND EDITION.\n\nTR\u00dcBNER & CO., LONDON, 1886.\nIndore (Indor).\u2014Large Native State in M\u00e1lw\u00e1, Central India, composing the territories of the Holkar dynasty. The political relations of the Indore State are conducted direct with the Agent of the Governor-General for Central India. The name of the State is taken from that of the capital, Indore city. Area, 8400 square miles. In 1878, the population was estimated (without enumeration) at 635,000. Population (1881) 1,054,237; density of population, 125 persons per square mile. The revenue of the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 was \u00a3707,440 in 1881-82.\n\nThe State consists of several isolated tracts. But since 1861, arrangements have been made to concentrate the territory as much as possible; and lands which were formerly held by Holkar in Ahmadnagar District of Bombay Presidency and in the Deccan have been exchanged for lands in Nim\u00e1war, and for the pargan\u00e1s of Barw\u00e1i, Dhurg\u00e1o\u00f1, Khasrawar, and Mandesar, bordering on the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) river and the tract in which Indore city is situated. This territory, within which is the British cantonment of Mhow (Mau), is bounded on the north by part of Sindhia's dominions; on the east by the States of Dew\u00e1s and Dh\u00e1r and the District of Nim\u00e1r; on the south by Kh\u00e1ndesh District of Bombay Presidency; and on the west by Barw\u00e1ni and Dh\u00e1r. It lies between 21\u00b0 24' and 4\u00b0 14' N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 28' and 77\u00b0 10' E. long. Its length from north to south is 120 miles, its breadth 82 miles; and it is nearly bisected by the Narbad\u00e1 river. The next largest portion of Holkar's dominions is that annexed to the town of Rampura, north of Indore, lying between 24\u00b0 3' and 24\u00b0 40' N. lat., and between 75\u00b0 6' and 76\u00b0 12' E. long. This tract is 70 miles in length from east to west, and\n40 in breadth. Its principal towns are Rampura, Bhanpura, and Chandwara. A third division, also north of Indore, includes the town of Mehidpur, in lat. $23^\\circ 29'$ N., and long. $75^\\circ 42'$ E. A fourth portion, westward of Indore, contains the town of Dhie, in lat. $22^\\circ 10'$ N., and long. $74^\\circ 39'$ E. Besides several smaller estates in M\u00e1lw\u00e1, including S\u00e1twas Nim\u00e1war recently acquired by exchange, there are over 160 kh\u00e1sgi or royal villages, most of them fairly populous. These villages are, so to speak, free of the law and the State judges. The revenue accruing to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja from this peculiar kh\u00e1sgi property was in 1873 over \u00a360,000, and \u00a346,020 in 1881-82.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The northern parts of the State are watered by the Chambal and its tributaries, and the tracts to the south by the Narbad\u00e1. The latter are traversed by the Vindhya range from east to west. They form a section of the Narbad\u00e1 valley, and are bounded on the south by the S\u00e1tpura mountains. The Narbad\u00e1 flows in a deep channel between precipitous banks of basaltic rock, and during the rains rushes down with great rapidity and in a large volume of water. The ascent from the Narbad\u00e1 valley to the higher portions of the State is in some places abrupt, and presents imposing precipices. The railway climbs about 600 feet up this southern escarpment of the Vindhyas, by steep gradients at places amounting to 1 in 40. The valley of Mandesar, in the centre of the State, has an elevation of between 600 and 700 feet above sea-level. The general appearance of the country is that of an undulating valley, intersected by low rocky ranges, in some parts thickly clothed with stunted jungle of dh\u00e1k, bab\u00fal, and other scrubwood. Jungle of the same nature also covers considerable tracts in the plains. Like the rest of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, the soil of Indore is fertile, consisting largely of the rich black loam known as 'cotton-soil.' It is formed apparently from the detritus of the trap mountains, and rests upon a platform of trap, about 30 feet below the surface. This formation holds in the water, so that the rainfall of 36 inches is amply sufficient. The principal crops are wheat, rice, millets, pulses, oilseeds, sugar-cane, and cotton. Cotton is chiefly grown in M\u00e1lw\u00e1 and Nim\u00e1r. The soil is peculiarly suited to the growth of the poppy plant, the cultivation of which is general. Tobacco of excellent quality is grown to a considerable extent. The forests of the State form two belts, one in the south, bordering on the S\u00e1tpura range, which is considered to be malarious, and another, which is healthier, in the Vindhya Hills. Teak is being cultivated, and encouragement is given to the production of lac. Wild animals include the tiger, leopard, hunting leopard (chita), lynx, hy\u00e6na, jackal, and fox, nilg\u00e1i (Portax pictus), and two species of wild cattle, the bison (Gav\u00e6us gaurus), found in the K\u00e1tkut and other jungles, and the wild buffalo (Bubalus arni) on the S\u00e1tpuras. Crocodiles and many venomous snakes are found.\nPopulation.\u2014The first attempt at a systematic Census was made in 1881, before which date all estimates of the population were more or less conjectural. The ruling class in Indore are Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. There are the usual other sub-divisions of Hindus, a few Muhammadans, and a considerable number of the aboriginal tribes of Gonds and Bh\u00edls. With the exception of these wild races, the inhabitants of Indore and M\u00e1lw\u00e1 are a cultivating rather than a fighting population. The regular army (ain fauj) of the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 is chiefly recruited from Northern India, beyond his own territories, and contains a large proportion of men from the British Provinces of Oudh, the North-West, and the Punjab. The Vindhya and S\u00e1tpura ranges are the home of the Bh\u00edls, where they have been settled from time immemorial. The Bh\u00edl race is one of the wildest in India, living for the most part on jungle products and game, or on the plunder of more civilised neighbours. They have, however, of late been brought into more peaceable habits of life; and many are now employed as soldiers and police, in which capacity they have proved themselves useful and trustworthy. The M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Bhil corps is a British force (1881) 527 strong, supplying detachments to the S\u00e1tpura Hills, R\u00e1jpur, Barw\u00e1ni, and Ratl\u00e1mi. The corps supports a regimental school, some of the pupils in which are Bh\u00edls. The Bh\u00edls are not, however, utilized in the regular army of Holkar.\n\nIn 1866\u201367, the total population of the Indore State was put down at 744,822, while in 1878 it was estimated at 635,000. The first regular Census of 1881 returned a total population for the whole State of 1,054,237. These are sub-divided as follows:\u2014Males, 559,616, or 53 per cent.; females, 494,621, or 47 per cent. The State contains 3734 towns and villages; occupied houses, 193,662; persons per occupied house, 5\u00b744. The religious division of the people is thus shown in the Census of 1881:\u2014Hindus, 892,675, or 84\u00b76 per cent.; Muhammadans, 72,747, or 6\u00b785 per cent.; Jains, 1645; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 127; Christians, 52. 601, or 5 per cent., are returned as Sikhs, and 86,390, or 8\u00b71 per cent., as aborigines\u2014mostly Gonds (7312) and Bh\u00edls (55,582). Separated into castes, there are 78,750 Br\u00e1hmans, 93,760 R\u00e1jputs, 43,945 Cham\u00e1rs, 36,053 G\u00fajurs, 45,940 Baniy\u00e1s, 25,451 Kunb\u00eds or cultivators; and other low castes. There are 7 towns with from one to two thousand inhabitants; 4 with from two to three thousand; 4 with from three to five thousand; 1 with from five to ten thousand; and 1 with over fifty thousand.\n\nRailways.\u2014The principal public work undertaken of late years in Indore, has been the extension to this territory of the general railway system of India. A State Railway, at present managed by the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India line, under the Imperial Department of Public Works, runs from Khandw\u00e1 junction (353 miles from Bombay) through Mhow (Mau) to Indore city, a distance of 85\u00be miles. The\nbranch is known as the Holkar State Railway as far as Indore, and is on the metre gauge (3 feet 3\\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) inches). The line was constructed by means of a loan of 100 l\u0101khs of rupees (\u00a31,000,000), made by the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Holkar to the British Government for a period of 101 years, to bear interest at the rate of \\(4\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent. per annum. The Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 also ceded the land required for the railway, free of charge; and the British Government has full civil and criminal jurisdiction, short of absolute sovereignty, over it. The Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 receives one-half of the surplus profit of the line, in excess of the \\(4\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent. interest on the capital invested. The principal engineering works on the railway are the ascent of the Vindhya escarpment already referred to, and the construction of a bridge across the Narbad\u0101, with 14 spans of 200 feet wrought-iron girders. The bridge was opened in October 1876. From Indore the line passes through part of Sindhia\u2019s dominions, Ratl\u0101m, Jaora, and Mew\u0101r, connecting Indore with Nas\u012br\u0101b\u0101d (Nuseer\u0101b\u0101d), and finally with Delhi and Agra. This northern section was made out of a loan to the British Government, ultimately amounting to 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) millions sterling, by the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 Sindhia, at 4 per cent. interest, for the construction of two lines through his dominions, namely from Gwalior to Agra, and from Indore to Nemach. Both lines are completed. The Indore-Nemach line has been amalgamated with the R\u0101jput\u0101na State Railway, and the whole line, from Indore to Nas\u012br\u0101b\u0101d, is known as the R\u0101jput\u0101na-M\u0101lw\u0101 State Railway. In 1881, a line between Chittor and Nas\u012br\u0101b\u0101d was opened for public traffic.\n\nThe chief means of road communication are the Bombay and Agra Trunk Road, which runs through Indore and Mhow, with a branch to Dh\u0101r. Another road, 80 miles in length, joins Indore with Khandw\u0101, crossing the Narbad\u0101 by the railway bridge. A metalled roadway is also in course of construction between Mhow and Nas\u012br\u0101b\u0101d.\n\n**Industries.**\u2014At Indore there is in constant work a steam cotton mill belonging to the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101. The weight of cloth produced in 1881 was 595,349 lbs. In 1878, the number of spindles was 10,000. Opium manufacture is another important industry; and in 1880\u201381, 13,837 chests were exported from Indore, yielding a revenue of \u00a370, now of \u00a365 (1885), per chest to the British Government at the border customs stations. In 1882\u201383, the number of chests was 12,477, and the British revenue, \u00a3873,390. The payment of revenue is made on weighment of the chests (140\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) lbs.), the rate levied being now \u00a365 per chest. The Governor-General\u2019s Agent is *ex officio* Opium Agent for the States of Central India and a part of R\u0101jput\u0101na. The central weighing office is in Indore, with seven subordinate assistant agencies in the principal local marts, Ujjain, Jaora, Dh\u0101r, Bhop\u0101l, Chittor, Mandesar, and Ratl\u0101m. All of these are on lines of railway, except Dh\u0101r. Much of the best land in Indore is taken up for opium,\nwhich is the best paying crop. The export of cereals, although important in years of exceptional productiveness, is not considerable in ordinary seasons. Wheat is probably destined, however, to become a large staple trade, notwithstanding the export duty levied on it by the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1.\n\n**History.**\u2014The history of Indore, as a separate State, only dates from the first half of the last century. The Holkar family are Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s of the Dh\u00e1ngar or goat-herd tribe. The founder of the dynasty was Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o, the son of a shepherd, who was born about 1693, in the village of Hol or Hal on the Nira river in the Deccan, from whence the family derives the surname of Holkar, the affix \u2018kar\u2019 or \u2018kur\u2019 signifying inhabitant. In his youth Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o abandoned his hereditary peaceful occupation, and joined a small body of cavalry in the service of a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 noble. He early distinguished himself; and about 1724 he entered the service of the Peshw\u00e1 as the commander of 500 horse. After this, his rise was rapid, and four years later he was rewarded by large tracts of land, the nucleus of the present principality. In 1732 he filled the post of principal general to the Peshw\u00e1, and defeated the army of the Mughal viceroy of M\u00e1lw\u00e1. Indore, with the greater portion of the conquered country, was assigned to Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o for the support of his troops; and in 1735 he was appointed commander of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 forces north of the Narbad\u00e1. During the next twelve years he was constantly employed,\u2014in campaigns against the Mughals, in assisting at the expulsion of the Portuguese from Bassein, and in aiding the Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edr Safdar Jang in preserving Oudh from the Rohill\u00e1s. During all this time his possessions and influence rapidly increased, and raised him to a foremost position among the chiefs of India. At the battle of P\u00e1nipat in 1761, Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o divided with Sindhia the command of the right wing of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 army. It is asserted that Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o did not here fight with his old spirit. He probably foresaw the event of the battle; at any rate, he retreated with his contingent before the defeat had become a rout.\n\nAfter P\u00e1nipat, Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o retired to Central India, and employed himself in reducing his vast possessions to coherence and order. He died in 1765, leaving a principality bringing in an annual revenue of three-quarters of a million sterling. He was succeeded by his grandson, M\u00e1li R\u00e1o, a lad who died insane nine months after his accession. The administration was then assumed by the famous Ahalya B\u00e1\u00ed, M\u00e1li R\u00e1o\u2019s mother, who prosperously ruled the State in conjunction with her commander-in-chief T\u00fakaj\u00ed R\u00e1o, for thirty years. She died in 1795, and was not long survived by T\u00fakaj\u00ed R\u00e1o; after whose death the power of the house of Holkar was nearly extinguished by family quarrels, and by the dissensions which distracted the whole Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 confederacy at the close of the last century. The fortunes of the family were,\nhowever, restored by Jaswant R\u00e1o, an illegitimate son of T\u00fakaj\u00ed, who, after a signal reverse from the army of Sindhia, employed European officers to reorganize and discipline his army. In 1802 he defeated the united army of Sindhia and the Peshw\u00e1 at the battle of Poona (P\u00fana), and possessed himself of that city. The treaty of Bassein between the Peshw\u00e1 and the British Government, resulted in the Peshw\u00e1 being restored to his capital as a virtual vassal of the British; and Jaswant R\u00e1o returned to his own dominions.\n\nIn the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 war of 1803, Jaswant R\u00e1o Holkar held aloof, apparently intending to take advantage of the hostilities to aggrandize himself at Sindhia\u2019s expense. His schemes, however, were rendered hopeless by the treaty of Sarj\u00ed Anjang\u00e1on; and after making a series of inadmissible proposals for an alliance, Holkar seems to have hastily determined, unaided and alone, to provoke hostilities with the British. In the war which followed, Holkar obtained a temporary advantage by compelling Colonel Monson to retreat with great loss. Holkar at once invaded British territory. Here, however, fortune deserted him, and, after successive defeats, he was forced to retire upon the Punjab, closely followed by Lord Lake, to whom, in December 1805, he surrendered himself, and signed a treaty on the banks of the Beas (Bi\u00e1s) river. By the treaty he gave up the territories which had been occupied by the British in the course of the war. These, however, were restored to him in the following year. Jaswant R\u00e1o afterwards became insane, and died in 1811, leaving the regency in the hands of a favourite concubine, Tuls\u00ed B\u00e1\u00ed, during the minority of his son, Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o Holkar. For some years, the State was torn by internal dissensions, and overrun by Pind\u00e1ri marauders. The army mutinied, and the queen regent petitioned that she and the youthful R\u00e1j\u00e1 might be received under British protection. While negotiations were proceeding, however, war broke out between the British and the Peshw\u00e1. A hostile bearing was assumed by the Indore Court. The queen regent was seized and murdered. Her murder was followed by the complete defeat of Holkar\u2019s army at Mehidpur, and the treaty of Mandesar on the 6th January 1818, which deprived him of much territory, and reduced him to the position of a feudatory prince. The terms of this treaty still govern the relations of the British Government with the State.\n\nMalh\u00e1r R\u00e1o Holkar died in 1833, at the age of 28, without issue, but his widow adopted, as his son, a child, M\u00e1rtand R\u00e1o. This adoption proved unpopular; and a few weeks afterwards, M\u00e1rtand R\u00e1o was summarily deposed by a cousin, Hari R\u00e1o, who had been in prison since 1819, in consequence of an unsuccessful rebellion, and whose accession was welcomed by the troops and people. His long imprisonment had, however, unfitted him to govern, and his reign was a period of intrigue and disorder. Hari R\u00e1o died in 1843, and his adopted\nson, who succeeded him, survived only for a few months, dying unmarried and without an heir. The selection was declared to rest with the British Government. T\u00fak\u00e1j\u00ed R\u00e1o (the present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1), the second son of Bhao Holkar, at that time eleven years of age, was chosen and formally installed. During his minority, the administration was conducted by a regency; but in 1852, the young Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 attained his majority, and was invested with the entire management of the affairs of the State. Since 1852 there has been little or no change in the political relations of Indore with the British Government. During the Mutiny of 1857, a considerable portion of the State troops rose against the British, and besieged Sir Henry Durand, the English political Resident at Indore. With some difficulty the Resident succeeded in retiring to Bhop\u00e1l with the English women and children. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 remained loyal. His rebellious troops a few weeks afterwards laid down their arms, and order was restored.\n\nThe relations of Indore with the British Government are\u2014that the British undertake to protect the State; and to mediate in case of differences with other States. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Holkar on his part engaged to abstain from direct communication with other States; to limit his military establishments; to employ no Europeans or Americans in his service without the consent of the British Government; and to afford every facility towards the purchase and transport of supplies for the auxiliary force to be maintained for his protection. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 has received a sanad of adoption. He has been created a Knight Grand Commander of the Star of India, a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire, and is entitled permanently to a salute of 19 guns in British territory, and to a salute of 21 guns in his own territory. The present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 enjoys a personal salute of 21 guns in British territory, and has been made a Counsellor of the Empress. Indore maintains a military establishment of 3100 regular and 2150 irregular infantry, 2100 regular and 1200 irregular cavalry, and 340 artillerymen, with nominally 24 field-guns equipped. As already stated, the regular army of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Holkar (ain fauj) is recruited chiefly from the British Provinces of Oudh and the North-West. There are also two companies of Sikhs from the Punjab. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 has powers of life and death.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The revenue of the State is steadily increasing. In 1875, the revenue amounted to \u00a3459,800, and the expenditure to \u00a3405,100. In 1878, the revenue was returned at \u00a3512,300, and the expenditure at \u00a3416,600. By 1881-82, the revenue of the State had increased to \u00a3707,440; the expenditure for the same period being \u00a3527,170. Of the latter sum, \u00a3120,810 defrayed the charges for the palace establishment; \u00a3172,320 the charges for the army and police; \u00a374,480 the charges for public works; \u00a34410 for education; \u00a35180 for courts of justice; \u00a31190 for the\npostal system; and \u00a32940 for hospitals and dispensaries. In 1881-82, the cost of the State-jail system was \u00a32620. The revenue items of importance in 1881-82 were as follow:\u2014Land revenue, \u00a3449,400; customs, \u00a373,170; abk\u00e1ri, or excise, \u00a311,280; tributes, \u00a315,850; stamps, \u00a34770; fines, \u00a39880; post-office, \u00a3680; mint, \u00a32790; and miscellaneous, \u00a340,650.\n\nIn 1881-82, there were altogether 107 schools in Indore territory; the number of pupils was 4942, or 353 more than in the year preceding. Within the limits of the Residency at Indore is situated the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r College, for the education of the sons of the native chiefs, nobles, and upper classes in Central India, affiliated to the Calcutta University. But the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r College, although situated at Indore, has no special connection with the State. It is mainly supported from imperial and local British funds. The College educates from 12 to 20 sons of Chiefs; and the Principal, by desire of the Chiefs, exercises a general supervision over the more important English-teaching schools in Central India. There is also a Residency School for the sons of persons residing within the limits of the British Residency at Indore. It has upwards of 200 pupils. The Canadian Presbyterian Mission has recently established another school within the Residency limits. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 has also a High School at Indore, teaching up to the matriculation standard, which is chiefly attended by the sons of the official class (Deccani Br\u00e1hmans) and bankers of the city. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s College at Indore educates almost exclusively Deccani Br\u00e1hmans. At Mandesar and Kharg\u00e1on there are English schools; and in the Mar\u00e1th\u00ed schools at Maheswar, R\u00e1mpura, Kanod, and Barw\u00e1i, English classes have been formed. The law and Sanskrit schools were established in 1875; there are three girls\u2019 schools in the State, two of them at Indore city, well attended. There are, besides, 9 Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, 36 Hind\u00ed, 8 Sanskrit, 9 Persian, and 14 Hind\u00ed-Mar\u00e1th\u00ed schools. The State expenditure on education in 1881-82 was \u00a34410.\n\nThe administration of justice is carried on by means of a Sadr or central court at Indore, presided over by English-speaking native judges. Three subsidiary zil\u00e1 courts are also established at Indore, Mandesar, and R\u00e1mpura. At each of these three places there is a State jail.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate of Indore State is sultry, the temperature ranging from 60\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 F, within doors. The annual rainfall at Indore city during the fourteen years ending 1881 averaged 36\u00b771 inches; the rainfall in 1881 was 31\u00b77 inches. The city has a charitable hospital, leper asylum, and dispensary. Cholera frequently ravages the State.\n\nIndore.\u2014Chief town of Indore State, and capital of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Holkar\u2019s territories; situated on the left bank of the Katki river, near its junction with the Kh\u00e1n river, in lat. 22\u00b0 42' N., and long. 75\u00b0 54' E. Height above sea-level, 1786 feet. Indore is the residence of the\nMah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, and of the Political Agent to the Governor-General for Central India. The town is of modern date, having been built by Ahalya B\u00e1\u00ed (circa 1770), after the death of Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o, the founder of the State. The former capital of the tract within which the city is situated, previous to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 invasion, was Kampail, 18 miles to the southeast. Kampail has dwindled to a village. The Court of Holkar was transferred to Indore in 1818; and now Indore is a prosperous city connected with the railway systems of Bombay and Northern and Eastern India. The population of the city in 1881 was 75,401, of whom 41,484 are males and 33,917 females. Hindus numbered 57,234; Muhammadans, 16,674; 'others,' 1493.\n\nIndore stands on an elevated and healthy site. Of recent years modern improvements have been introduced. Roads have been metalled, drains built, the water-supply cared for, and the principal streets lighted. The palace of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, with its lofty, many-storied gateway, is conspicuous from every part of the city. Among the chief objects of interest are the L\u00e1l B\u00e1gh or garden, with its pleasant summer palace and interesting collection of animals, the mint, high school, market-place, reading-room, dispensary, and large cotton mill. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 takes a keen interest in his cotton factory, and has spent a large sum of money upon it. To the west of the city is an antelope preserve, where sport with hunting-leopards may be enjoyed. The railway station is about a mile from the palace.\n\nApart from the town of Indore, but adjoining it, on the other side of the railway, is the British Residency. This term comprises not only the mansion and park of the Governor-General's Agent for Central India, but also an area assigned by treaty, within what are known as the Residency Limits. A b\u00e1z\u00e1r of some importance has grown up within this area, and the freedom from transit duties along the British Trunk Road is developing an export trade in grain, etc., by the railway. The central opium stores and weighing agency, referred to under INDORE STATE, also lie in this little tract. The hospital within the Residency Limits is one of the most useful and successful institutions of the kind in India. It has a special reputation for its major operations, which number about five hundred per annum; one special feature of its surgical cases being the manufacture of new noses for women who have suffered the penalty in Native States for conjugal infidelity, real or supposed. The aggrieved or jealous husband throws his suspected wife down and cuts off her nose. The woman then repairs to the hospital at Indore, sometimes with her amputated nose carefully wrapped up in a napkin. The process of reproduction is generally successful, and this together with other operations in surgery has earned a high reputation for the hospital throughout the Native States of Central\nIndia and R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, as far as the confines of the Bombay Districts. The Residency itself is a handsome stone mansion, approached by a rather imposing flight of steps, and surrounded by gardens tastefully laid out. From this stretches a park of considerable extent. A little river, the Kh\u00e1n, has been utilized to form a sylvan retreat of wood, water, and creeping plants, of almost unique beauty in India.\n\nThe height of Indore above the gh\u00e1ts or Vindhya escarpment which rises from the Narb\u00e1da valley, and 1786 feet above sea-level, renders the climate cool and agreeable, with the exception of two really hot months in summer. A body of native and European troops acts as the escort to the Governor-General's Agent, and is provided with a range of spacious barracks. Several small bungalows are occupied by the British Residency staff and other Government servants. The R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r College, where the young chiefs and nobles of Central India are educated, is situated within the jurisdiction of the Residency. It has been referred to, along with other local institutions, in the preceding article on Indore State.\n\n**Indore Agency.**\u2014The collective name given to the three Native States of Central India comprised therein, namely, Indore, Dew\u00e1s, and Bagli (all of which see separately), under the superintendence of the Government of India, through an official styled 'Governor-General's Agent for Central India.'\n\n**Indori.**\u2014Small hill torrent in Gurg\u00e1on District, Punjab. Rises beyond the boundary in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, on the Alwar (Ulwur) side of the Mew\u00e1t Hills; runs due northward into British territory; passes the towns of T\u00e1oru and Bahora; and finally, after joining the S\u00e1hibi, falls into the Najaigarh jhil. The Indori frequently floods the country at the foot of the hills. There is a second and smaller stream of the same name, which falls into the S\u00e1hibi, some six miles above the junction of its larger namesake. Both are mere torrents, flowing only after rain.\n\n**Indus** (Sanskrit, Sindhu; Greek, Sinthus; Latin, Sindus).\u2014River in Northern India. The Indus rises in an unexplored region on the northern slopes of the sacred Kail\u00e1s Mountain, the Elysium of ancient Sanskrit literature; and as the Sutlej (Satlej) is in the Aryan tradition supposed to issue from the mouth of a crocodile, so the Indus is said to spring from the mouth of a lion. On the south of the Kail\u00e1s Mountain rises the Sutlej, the great feeder of the Indus, which unites with it after a separate course of about 1000 miles. The Indus rises in lat. 32\u00b0 N. and long. 81\u00b0 E., enters the Punjab (Panj\u00e1b) in lat. 34\u00b0 25' N. and long. 72\u00b0 51' E., leaves the Punjab in lat. 28\u00b0 26' N. and long. 69\u00b0 47' E., enters Sind in lat. 28\u00b0 26' N. and long. 69\u00b0 47' E., and finally falls into the Arabian Sea in lat. 23\u00b0 58' N. and long. 67\u00b0 30' E. The drainage basin of the Indus is estimated at 372,700 square miles, and its total length at a little over 1800 miles. The towns of import-\nance on or near its banks in British territory are Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee), Kotri, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Sehw\u00e1n, Sukkur (Sakhar), Rohri, Mith\u00e1nkot, Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, K\u00e1la B\u00e1gh, and Attock.\n\nThe first section of the course of the Indus lies outside British territory, and must be briefly dealt with here. The river rises in Tibet behind the great mountain wall of the Him\u00e1layas, which forms the northern boundary of India. Rising from the ring of lofty mountains about Lake Man\u00e1sarowar, whence also the Sutlej, the Brahmaputra, and the Gogra spring, it flows north-west for about 160 miles under the name of Singh-ka-b\u00e1b, until it receives the Ghar river on its south-western bank. A short distance below the junction of the Indus and the Ghar, it enters Kashmir, and continues north-west to Leh, where it is joined by the Zanskar river, and crossed by the great trade route into Central Asia via the Karakoram Pass. Early travellers like Dr. Thomson and Mr. Blane have described this portion of the Indus. The former found numerous hot springs, some of them with a temperature of $174^\\circ$ F., and exhaling a sulphurous gas. The Indus is supposed to have an elevation of 16,000 feet at its source. Shortly after it passes the Kashmir frontier, it drops to 14,000 feet, and at Leh is only about 11,278 feet above the level of the sea. The rapid stream dashes down gorges and wild mountain valleys; it is subject to tremendous floods; and in its lower and more level course it is swept by terrific blasts. Even in summer it is said to dwindle down to a fordable depth during the night, and during the course of the day to swell into an impassable torrent from the melting of the snows on the adjoining heights. Still flowing north-west through Kashmir territory, it passes near Iskardoh in Little Tibet, until in about lat. $34^\\circ 50'$ N., and long. $74^\\circ 30'$ E., it takes a turn southwards at an acute angle, receives the Gilgit river from the north, and shortly afterwards enters Kohist\u00e1n near G\u00far. It then passes for about 120 miles south-west through the wilds of Kohist\u00e1n, until it reaches the Punjab frontier in lat. $34^\\circ 25'$ N., and long. $72^\\circ 51'$ E., near Derbend, at the western base of the Mah\u00e1ban mountain. The only point to which special allusion can be made in the long section of its course beyond British territory is the wonderful gorge by which the river bursts through the western ranges of the Him\u00e1layas. This gorge is near Iskardoh in Little Tibet (i.e. North-Western Kashmir), and is said to be 14,000 feet in sheer descent.\n\nThe Indus, on entering the Punjab, 812 miles from its source, is about 100 yards wide in August, navigable by rafts, but of no great depth, and studded with sandbanks and islands. It is fordable in many places during the cold weather; but floods or freshets are sudden, and Ranj\u00edt Singh is said to have lost a force, variously stated at from 1200 to 7000 horsemen, in crossing the river. Even the large and\nsolid ferry-boats which ply upon it are sometimes swept away. A little way above Attock, in Rawal Pindi District, it receives the K\u00e1b\u00fal river, which brings down the waters of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n. The two rivers have about an equal volume, both are very swift, and broken up with rocks. Their junction during floods is the scene of a wild confusion of waters. The K\u00e1b\u00fal river is navigable for about 40 miles above the confluence, but a rapid just above it renders the Indus impracticable.\n\nAttock (Atak), the limit of the upward navigation of the Indus, forms the first important point on the Indus within British territory. By this time the river has flowed upwards of 860 miles, or nearly one-half of its total length, its further course to the sea being about 940 miles. It has fallen from its elevation of 16,000 feet at its source in Tibet to about 2000 feet, the height of Attock being 2079 feet. In the hot season, opposite the fort, its velocity is 13 miles an hour; and in the cold season, 5 to 7 miles. The rise of ordinary floods is from 5 to 7 feet in 24 hours only, and the maximum is 50 feet above cold-weather level. Its width varies greatly with the season; at one time over 250 yards, at another less than 100. The Indus is crossed at Attock by a bridge of boats and a ferry: in its upper course a massak or inflated skin is the usual means of transportation. The main trunk road to Pesh\u00e1war also crosses the river at Attock. By the opening of the Attock railway bridge across the Indus in May 1883, the chain of railway communication between Pesh\u00e1war, Bombay, and Calcutta was completed. The view from the railway bridge is a very striking one.\n\nAfter leaving Attock, the Indus flows almost due south along the western side of the Punjab, parallel to the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n Hills. The great north road from Sind to Bannu runs for several hundreds of miles close to its western bank; and another road from Mult\u00e1n (Mooltan) to Rawal Pindi almost parallel to its eastern bank. The river intersects the two frontier Districts of Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n and Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, with the Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r Do\u00e1b on its eastern bank, and only a narrow strip of British territory between it and the hill tribes of the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n ranges on the west. Just above Mith\u00e1nkot, in the south of Dera Gh\u00e1z\u00ed Kh\u00e1n District, the Indus receives the accumulated waters of the Punjab. Between the Indus and the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1) flow the five great streams from which the Punjab (Panj-\u00e1b, literally \u2018The land of the five waters\u2019) takes its name. These are the Jehlam (Jhelum), the Chenab, the Ravi, the Beas (Bi\u00e1s), and the Sutlej. After various junctions, these rivers all unite to form the river Panjnad, literally \u2018The five rivers.\u2019 The Panjnad marks for a short space the boundary between the Punjab and Bah\u00e1walpur State, and unites with the Indus near Mith\u00e1nkot, about 490 miles from the sea. The breadth of the Indus above the confluence is about 600 yards, its velocity 5\nmiles an hour, its depth from 12 to 15 feet, and its estimated discharge 91,719 cubic feet per second. The breadth of the Panjnad above the point of junction is 1076 yards, with an equal depth of 12 to 15 feet, but a velocity of only 2 miles an hour. Its estimated discharge is 68,955 cubic feet per second. Below the junction the united stream, under the name of the Indus, has a breadth which varies from 2000 yards to several miles, according to the season of the year.\n\nThe whole course of the Indus through the Punjab is broken by islands and sandbanks, but some beautiful scenes are afforded along its banks, which, especially near Bukkur, abound with the date, acacia, pomegranate, and other trees. Mith\u00e1nkot has an elevation of only 258 feet above the level of the sea. From Mith\u00e1nkot the Indus forms the boundary between the Punjab and Bah\u00e1walpur State, until near Kashmor it enters Sind in lat. 28\u00b0 26' N., and long. 69\u00b0 47' E. Kashmor is the most northern town on the Indus in Sind. From Bukkur in Sind to the sea, the river is known as the 'Lower Sind,' but it is also known familiarly among the Sindis as the 'Daryah.' Pliny writes of *Indus incolis* *Sindus appellatus*. Finally the river empties itself by many mouths into the Arabian Sea, after a generally south-westerly course in that Province of 580 miles. It ranges in width from 480 to 1600 yards, the average during the low season being 680 yards. During the floods it is in places more than a mile wide. Its depth varies from 4 to 24 feet. The water, derived from the snows of the Him\u00e1layas, is of a dirty brown colour, and slightly charged with saline ingredients, carbonate of soda and nitrate of potash. Its velocity in the freshets averages 8 miles per hour, at ordinary times 4 miles. The discharge per second varies at the two periods from 446,086 cubic feet to 40,857 cubic feet. On an average, the temperature of the water is 10\u00b0 F. lower than that of the air.\n\nThe delta of the Indus covers an area of about 3000 square miles, and extends along the coast-line for 125 miles. It is almost a perfect level, and nearly destitute of timber, the tamarisk and mangrove alone supplying fuel. In these respects the delta of the Indus is similar to the Nile, but dissimilar from the Ganges, delta. The marshy portions contain good pasturage, and rice grows luxuriantly wherever cultivation is possible, but the soil generally is not fertile, being a mixture of sand and clay. In the Sh\u00e1hbandar District are immense deposits of salt. The climate of the delta is cool and bracing in the winter months, excessively hot in the summer, and during the floods most unhealthy. In 1800, the Indus at the apex of the delta divided into two main streams, known as the Baghi\u00e1r and S\u00edt\u00e1; but in 1837 it had entirely deserted the former channel. The Khedew\u00e1ri passage also, which before 1819 was the highway of water traffic to Sh\u00e1hbandar, was in that\nyear closed by an earthquake. In 1837, the Kakaiwari, which had then increased from a shallow creek to a river with an average width at low water of 770 yards, was recognised as the highway; but before 1867, this also was completely blocked. For the present the Hajamro, which before 1845 was only navigable for the smallest boats, is the main estuary of the Indus. The shape of the Hajamro is that of a funnel, the mouth to the sea; on the east side of the entrance is a beacon 95 feet high, visible for two miles; and two well-manned pilot boats lie inside the bar to point out the difficulties of navigation.\n\nThe following facts illustrate further the shifting nature of the Indus. In 1845, Ghorabari, then the chief commercial town of the delta, was on the river bank; but in 1848 the river deserted its bed. The town of Keti was built on the new bank. The new bank was overflowed a few years later, and a second Keti had to be built farther off. At present one of the chief obstructions to navigation is a series of rocks between Tatta and Bhim\u00e1n-jo-pura, which in 1846 were 8 miles inland. In 1863, a thousand acres of the Dh\u00e1rej\u00e1 forest were swept away. The rapidity and extent of the destructive action in constant progress in the delta may be estimated from the fact that travellers have counted by the reports as many as 13 bank slips in a minute. In some places the elephant grass (Typha elephantina) does good service by driving its roots very deeply (often 9 feet) into the ground, and thereby holding it together.\n\nThe Indus begins to rise in March, attains its maximum depth and width in August, and subsides in September. The registered rise at Gidu-Bandar, near Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, is 15 feet. Other river gauges are at Kotri and Bukkur, the latter a fortified island in the river.\n\nFish abound. At the mouths, the salt-water varieties include the Clupea neowhii, a species of herring largely consumed along the coast and in the delta. The chief of the fresh-water varieties is the pala, placed by Dr. Day under the Clupeid\u00e6, and nearly allied to, if not identical with, the hilsa of the Ganges. The local consumption and also the export of dried pala are very large. Otters, turtles, porpoises, water-snakes, and crocodiles are numerous.\n\nThe entire course of the Indus in British territory, from Attock to the sea, lies within the zone of deficient rainfall, the annual average being nowhere higher than 10 inches. Cultivation, therefore, is absolutely dependent upon artificial irrigation, almost to as great an extent as in the typical example of Egypt. But the Indus is a less manageable river than the Nile. Its main channel is constantly shifting; at only three places, Sukkur (Sakhar), Jerruck (Jirak), and Kotri, are the river banks permanent; and during the season of flood, the melted snows of the Himalayas come down in an impetuous torrent which no embankment can restrain. From time immemorial, this annual inunda-\ntion, which is to Sind what the monsoons are to other parts of India, has been utilized as far as possible by an industrious peasantry, who lead the water over their fields by countless artificial channels. Many such channels, constructed in the old days of native rule, extend 30 and even 40 miles from the river bank; but no comprehensive scheme of irrigation, comparable to the works on the Ganges and Jumna, has yet been taken in hand by British engineers. The existing canals are all classified as 'intermittent inundation canals,' i.e. they have been constructed without system so as merely to intercept the flood-waters when they rise high enough to overtop the head-works. The first recorded inundation of the Indus took place in 1833; another occurred in 1841 on a much larger scale. This flood was said to have been caused by the bursting of a glacier which formed over an accumulation of water in the Nubra Tso, into which there was a regular and steady flow of water from the surrounding hills. Eventually the glacier was burst asunder by the pressure, and the released flood poured down the Sheok valley, carrying everything before it. There was another great flood of the Indus in August 1858. On the 10th of that month at 5 A.M. the river at Attock was very low; at 11 A.M. it had suddenly risen 11 feet; by 1.30 it had risen 50 feet; and in the evening the river was 90 feet higher than in the morning. By this flood the greater part of private property in Nowshera cantonment was destroyed.\n\nThe great want of Sind is recognised to be a system of 'perennial canals,' which shall take off from the Indus at those few points in its course where a permanent supply can be secured all the year through, and regulated by a series of dams and sluices. One such work, 63 miles long, the Sukkur Canal, was approved in the year 1861, and was finished in 1870. Of recent years the Indus has been embanked from above Kashmor to the mouth of the Beg\u00e1ri Canal, a distance of more than 50 miles. The embankment has proved a great protection to the Sind-Pishin or Kandah\u00e1r railway, which here runs parallel to the Indus. A full account of irrigation in Sind will be found in the article on that Province. It must suffice in this place to give a list of the principal works, following the Indus downwards from the Punjab. The waters of the river are first utilized on a large scale in the thirsty Districts of the Deraj\u00e1t, which form a narrow strip between the Indus and the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n mountains. The canals in this tract have an aggregate length of 618 miles, of which 108 have been constructed under British rule. In Muzaffargarh District, and in the Native State of Bah\u00e1walpur, which extends 300 miles along the opposite bank, the Chen\u00e1b and Sutlej, as well as the Indus, contribute to render cultivation possible. In Sind itself, the following are the chief canal systems:\u2014On the right or west bank, the Sukkur, the Sind, the Ghar or Lark\u00e1na, the Beg\u00e1ri, and the Western N\u00e1ra; on the left or east\nbank, the Eastern N\u00e1ra and the Fuleli, each with many distributaries. The total area irrigated by canals from the Indus in 1883\u201384 was: in the Punjab, 150,418 acres; in Sind, 1,627,900 acres, thus distributed among the several Districts,\u2014Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed, 248,371 acres; Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, 517,403 acres; Shikarpur, 563,897 acres; Upper Sind Frontier, 209,867 acres; Thar and Parkar, 88,362 acres.\n\nAs a channel of navigation, the Indus has disappointed the expectations that were at one time formed. Before British arms had conquered Sind and the Punjab, it was hoped that the fabled wealth of Central Asia might be brought by this course down to the sea. But, even so far as local traffic is concerned, experience has proved in this case, as with most other Indian rivers, that the cheapness of water communication cannot compete with the superior speed and certainty of railways. Since the opening of the Indus Valley State Railway in the autumn of 1878, navigation on the Indus, whether by steamer or by native boat, has greatly fallen off. The general character of the Indus trade may be inferred from the following statistics, which refer to 1875\u201376. The Indus flotilla, under the management of the Sind Railway Company, carried down-stream goods to the value of \u00a3519,000, the chief items being Indian cotton goods (\u00a3219,600), wool (\u00a389,000), oil-seeds, indigo, and sugar; the up-traffic by steamer was valued at \u00a3518,000, almost entirely confined to Manchester piece-goods (\u00a3415,000) and metals (\u00a361,000). The traffic down-stream in country boats, as registered at Sukkur, was valued at \u00a3449,000, the chief items being wool, oil-seeds, wheat, and raw cotton. The return trade by country boats was valued at only \u00a386,000, of which more than one-half was metals. The total number of boats passing Sukkur was 3117, of which 2616, with cargoes aggregating 1,272,186 maunds, or 45,435 tons, were going down-stream. The total receipts of the Conservancy and Registration Department in 1875\u201376 amounted to \u00a35916, against an expenditure of \u00a36442, showing a deficit of \u00a3526. The Indus flotilla was abolished in 1882\u201383.\n\nThe first steamer was placed on the river in 1835. In 1847 there were 10 Government steamers, with head-quarters and a factory at Kotri, the yearly expenditure ranging from \u00a327,500 to \u00a350,000. This flotilla was broken up in 1862. In 1859, a company established another \u2018Indus flotilla\u2019 in connection with the Sind Railway, with which it was formally amalgamated in 1870, the joint head-quarters being removed to Lahore in the Punjab. In 1874, the number of steamers plying was 14, and of barges 43, with an aggregate tonnage of 10,641 tons. The receipts were \u00a383,370, being from goods up-river, \u00a353,955; down-river, \u00a323,678; and from passenger traffic, \u00a35737. As previously stated, the railway flotilla was abolished in 1882\u201383. These were not the only \u2018flotilla\u2019 experiments on the Indus. In\n1856, the Oriental Inland Steam Company obtained a yearly subsidy of \u00a35000 from Government. In 1861, the Company had 3 steamers and 9 barges on the river; but as the river current proved too powerful for the steamers, the Company stopped the traffic, and eventually collapsed.\n\nFor the conservancy of the river, Act i. of 1863 (Bombay) provides for the registration of vessels, and the levy of pilotage fees by an officer called the Conservator and Registrar of the Indus, the sum realized being expended on the improvement of navigation.\n\nThe boats of the Indus are the d\u00fcndhi and zaurak, both cargo-boats, the kauntal, or ferry-boats, and the d\u00fado, or fishing-boats. The cargo-boats are sometimes of 60 tons burden, and when laden draw 4 feet of water. The state barges or jhamptis of the M\u012brs were built of teak, four-masted, and sometimes required crews of 30 men.\n\n**Inhauna.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Digbijaganj tahsil, R\u00e1i Bareli District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Haidargarh and Subeha pargan\u00e1s of Bara Banki District, on the east by Jagdispur pargan\u00e1 of Sult\u00e1npur, on the south by Simrauta and Mohanganj pargan\u00e1s of R\u00e1i Bareli. Originally held by the Bhars, an officer of Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad's army defeated them, and occupied their fort, but appears to have made little progress. Ultimately, a Bais named Bin\u00e1r Sah came from the west, drove out the Dhob\u00eds and Bhars, and acquired the whole country. Area, 100 square miles, of which 44 are under cultivation, and 26 fit for cultivation but not under tillage. Government land revenue, \u00a36639, at the rate of 2s. 1\u00bed. an acre. Of the 77 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 37 are held by Hindu Bais, and 24 by Bharsi\u00e1ns, a family of Bais who have been converted to Isl\u00e1m. Twelve villages are held under zamind\u00e1ri tenure, 21 are t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri, and 44 pattid\u00e1ri. Population (1881), Hindus, 43,166; Muhammadans, 8650; 'others,' 2; total, 51,818, namely, 24,693 males and 27,693 females: average density of population, 518 per square mile.\n\n**Inhauna.**\u2014Town in R\u00e1i Bareli District, Oudh; situated about midway on the unmetalled road between Lucknow and Sult\u00e1npur, 30 miles from R\u00e1i Bareli town, and head-quarters of Inhauna pargan\u00e1. Lat. 26\u00b0 32' N., long. 81\u00b0 32' E. Formerly the head-quarters of a tahsil and police circle, removed on the re-arrangement of Oudh Districts in 1869, since which time its traffic has considerably diminished. Population (1881) 3027, namely, Hindus, 1641, and Muhammadans, 1386. The town contains a b\u00e1z\u00e1r (Ratanganj), and a vernacular school, with 101 pupils on its roll in 1883.\n\n**Injar\u00e1m (Injeram).**\u2014Town in Korangi (Coringa) zamind\u00e1ri, God\u00e1var\u00ed District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 16\u00b0 43' N., long. 82\u00b0 15' E.; 5 miles south of Korangi. Houses, 380, with (1881) 1660 inhabitants. Now only known as having been one of the earliest of the British settle-\nments on this coast. The factory was founded in 1708, and was celebrated for a manufacture of fine long cloth that afterwards declined. In May 1757, the factory was captured by Bussy. But Injar\u00e1m continued a mercantile station of the Company till 1829. An irrigation canal takes its name from the town. Injar\u00e1m and its neighbourhood suffered greatly from a cyclone in 1839.\n\n**Insein.**\u2014Town in Rangoon District, British Burma; distant 9 miles from Rangoon. Station on the Irawadi State Railway.\n\n**In-yeh (Eng-rat).**\u2014Town in Bassein District, Irawadi Division, British Burma; situated on the right bank of the Daga river, in lat. 17\u00b0 10' 30\" N., and long. 95\u00b0 18' 30\" E. Formerly the head-quarters of the extra-Assistant Commissioner. Population (1881) 940, engaged in rice cultivation and fishing. The town contains 92 houses, and has a police station. Excise revenue (1881), other than that accruing from the tax on palm-toddy, \u00a380.\n\n**In-yeh-gyi (Eng-rai-gyi).**\u2014Lake in Bassein District, Irawadi Division, British Burma; about 5 miles in circumference, with fairly uniform breadth of 280 to 300 yards, and a depth of from 20' to 45 feet in the centre. It is connected with the Daga branch of the Bassein by a small outlet, which serves to replenish the lake from the Irawadi and to carry off the surplus water. This lake is by some supposed to have been a former portion of the bed of the Daga, by others it is thought to have been caused by a slip of the lower-lying beds, totally independent of fluvial action. It is very valuable as a preserve for fish, and proved an important source of revenue to the Burmese Government, who exacted an annual tax of \u00a3780 from the Penin or hereditary chief of the lake, who had sole authority over the villagers employed in the fishery. Each villager had the right of investing his capital in the general working of the fishery, and received a share in the out-turn at the end of the season proportionate to the sum subscribed. The process of dragging the lake is performed by floating capstans worked by hawsers of jungle rope attached to a frame, and occupies three months' working, at the rate of about 45 fathoms each day. The fishing begins with the full moon in June, when the temperature of the water has been reduced by the first showers of the monsoon. The number of fish caught is never below 70,000 to 80,000 of all kinds; they belong for the most part to the genera of Cerca, Cyprinus, Gobio, Labeo, Cimelodus, Cirrhinus, Cyprinodon, and Silurus. The largest specimens weigh about 56 lbs. each. Crocodiles of all sizes are found in the drag-net. Some 8000 to 10,000 persons are engaged in the taking and disposal of the fish, of which about 40 tons are annually sold on the spot.\n\n**Ir\u00e1k (or Loyach).**\u2014River in Sind, Bombay Presidency; rises in lat. 25\u00b0 20' N., and long. 67\u00b0 45' E., at the foot of the Hath\u00fal Hills, between\nKar\u00e1ch\u00ed (Kurrachee) and Schw\u00e1n, and, after a south-easterly course of 40 miles, falls into Lake Kanjar in lat. $24^\\circ 53'$ N., and long. $68^\\circ 6'$ E.\n\n**Irawadi.**\u2014Principal river of Burma. The Irawadi rises in independent territory, and traverses the Pegu and Irawadi Divisions of British Burma from north to south. The source of the Irawadi has not yet (1884) been discovered. Several distinct theories exist upon the subject. D\u2019Anville, in the 18th century, thought the Irawadi was identical with the Tsanpu (Sanpo), which flows through Tibet from west to east. Dalrymple\u2019s map accompanying Syme\u2019s *Embassy to Ava* (Ava) shows the Tsanpu as one of the sources of the Irawadi, but their point of union is not defined. In 1825, Klapproth maintained that the Irawadi was a continuation of the Pinlaing-kiang, which, after flowing through Western Yunan from the west, not the north, entered the valley of the Irawadi at Bhamo (Ba-maw). Other geographers asserted that the true source of the river was to be sought in China. Colonel Henry Yule, the chief of recent authorities, holds that the cradle of the Irawadi is in the Langtam range of the Him\u00e1layas. Mr. R. Gordon, late Executive Engineer at Henzada on the Irawadi, adopts the theory that the Irawadi is a continuation of the Sanpo. It is now, however, generally accepted that the Brahmaputra, not the Irawadi, is the continuation of the Tsanpu. The connection of the Brahmaputra with the Tsanpu was discovered by Lieutenants Wilcox and Burton, who crossed from Assam into Tibet in 1827; and this indicates, as conclusively as can be shown until the entire course of the river is traced, that the Irawadi rises in the southern slopes of the Patkoi Mountains. One branch of it apparently rises in lat. $27^\\circ 43'$ N., long. $97^\\circ 25'$ E., and another in the same hills a few days\u2019 journey farther east. These two branches\u2014known as the Myit-gyi, or \u2018Large River,\u2019 and Myit-ng\u00e9, or \u2018Small River\u2019\u2014unite to form the Irawadi in lat. $26^\\circ$ N. The most upward point of the river yet reached by a European (Mr. Strettel) is the defile of Munt-gaung within the same parallel of latitude.\n\nThe general course of the Irawadi is from north to south. Starting from its assigned head-quarters in lat. $26^\\circ$ N., it flows through independent Burmese territory until a point on the frontier 11 miles north of the town of Thayet-myo is reached. During its course through independent territory it receives, as chief tributaries from the westward, the Mogaung, the Kyaung, the M\u00fa, and lesser streams. The Mogaung joins the main river (600 yards wide at the junction) in lat. $24^\\circ 50'$ N., 100 miles above Bhamo; the Kyaung joins 100 miles below Bhamo; and the M\u00fa about 50 miles below Mandalay. From the eastward, in independent territory north of Bhamo, the Irawadi receives the waters of the Shimai, the Moulay, and the Taping; south of Bhamo, it is increased by the waters of the Shwe-li, Kyin-dwin, Myit-ng\u00e9, and Pan-baung.\nShortly after the confluence of the Mogaung, the main stream of the Irawadi enters the first or upper defile. Here the breadth of the river varies between 50 and 250 yards; the current is very rapid, and the backwaters occasion violent eddies and whirlpools. When the river is at its lowest, no bottom is found even at 40 fathoms. At Bhamo, the Irawadi receives the Ta-ping from the east; and then, turning south, after a long bend to the westward enters a second defile 5 miles long, which is exceedingly picturesque, the stream winding in perfect stillness under high bare rocks rising sheer out of the water.\n\nFarther down, not far from Mandalay, is the third or lowest defile. The river banks are covered at this point with dense vegetation, and slope down to the water's edge; at places rise almost perpendicular, but wooded, heights. Except when the river is at its highest, the navigation of the two lower defiles is easy and safe for all but very long steamers. The valley of Ava begins below the third defile, and lies entirely on the east side of the Irawadi; the range of the Minwun Hills, terminating at Sagain opposite Ava, hems the river closely in on the west. After receiving the waters of the Myit-nge, as far as 17\u00b0 N. lat., the course of the Irawadi is exceedingly tortuous. The British frontier is crossed in lat. 19\u00b0 29' 3\" N., long. 95\u00b0 15' E., the breadth of the river being here three-quarters of a mile. Opposite Thayet-myo, about 11 miles lower down, it is nearly 3 miles broad from bank to bank. Forty-eight miles farther south it passes Prome. At Akauk-Taung, where a spur of the Arakan Hills ends abruptly in a precipice 300 feet high, the river enters its delta, the hills giving place to low alluvial plains, now protected on the west by extensive embankments. From 17\u00b0 N. lat., a little above Henzada, 90 miles inland, the Irawadi sends off its first branch to the westward. This branch, sweeping past Bassein, takes its designation as the Bassein river from the name of the port, and, bifurcating, flows into the sea by two chief mouths. A little below Henzada the main stream sends off a small arm eastward to join the Hlaing river above and near Rangoon, and, dividing and sub-dividing, enters the sea by nine principal mouths. These mouths are named the Bassein, the Thek-ngay-thaung or eastern entrance of the Bassein, the Rangoon, the To or China Bakir, the Pya-p\u00fan, the Ky\u00fan-t\u00fan or Dala, the Irawadi, the Pya-ma-law, and the Rwe. The Bassein and Rangoon mouths are the only mouths used by sea-going ships.\n\nThe valley of the Irawadi, for the most part devoted to rice cultivation, is about 80 miles broad at the frontier line. It gradually widens towards the south; and at 60 or 70 miles below the frontier becomes a broad, level, and highly-cultivated plain. At its lower end the valley of the Irawadi meets the valley of the Sittaung, and stretches, as a great flat country, from Cape Negrais on the west to Martaban\non the east. The watershed between the upper courses of the Irawadi and the Sittaung is the Pegu Yoma range (yoma = backbone), which runs from north to south till it terminates in low hills at Rangoon. The main valley of the Irawadi is split up into several smaller valleys, separated by the spurs of the Pegu Yoma Hills; such as the valley of the Hlaing river, the valley of the Pegu river, and the valley of the Pu-zu-daung river. The plains of the Irawadi, extending from Prome, in lat. $18^\\circ 15'$, to the sea, in lat. $15^\\circ 50'$, are subject to annual inundations, which it has been the endeavour of Government to lessen or prevent. In 1879, Mr. R. Gordon, Executive Engineer at Henzada, published the results of an investigation as to what would be the consequences of embanking the Irawadi main channel on two sides from the head of the delta seawards for a distance of 150 miles. Part of a continuous embankment of one side of the Irawadi, throughout Lower Burma, had been carried on in a desultory manner from 1863 to 1867; but eventually Mr. Gordon was directed to obtain exact data as to levels of surface and volume of water to be dealt with before the project should be resumed. As the result of his investigations, Mr. Gordon was in favour of the embankment of the Irawadi being carried out, and cited the successful embankment of the Nawun river, which has been practically encased, as an additional reason for his opinion. In accordance, therefore, with this and other testimony, the embankment works are being vigorously prosecuted; and a special Act (xiii. of 1877) gives power to the Embankment Officer to impress all able-bodied persons, when a flood or other emergency occurs, for the construction or repair of the embankments.\n\nThe Embankment system is divided into two series, the Western and the Eastern. The former embraces the Kyangin, Myanaung, and Henzada sections; the latter includes only a few projects in the survey stage. The amount expended on the Western series up to 1883 was \u00a3305,882; and the expenditure during that year was only \u00a34676. See Henzada District. In addition, \u00a3200,000 was expended in 1882-83 in cutting the Tunte Canal, 8 miles long, a work meant to shorten and facilitate the passage of craft between the Irawadi and Rangoon river.\n\nThe Irawadi Delta is constantly encroaching on the sea, owing to the immense quantity of silt brought down by the river, and is cut up into numerous islands by a labyrinth of tidal creeks. Scattered along these in the extreme south are temporary villages, occupied during the dry season by salt boilers and makers of nga-pi or fish-paste.\n\nThe area of the catchment basin of the Irawadi is 158,009 square miles; the area of the delta is 18,000 square miles; and the total length of the river from its assigned source to the sea is about 900 miles, the last\n240 miles flowing in British territory. As far down as Akauk-taung in Henzada District, its bed is rocky; but below this, sandy and muddy. It is full of islands and sandbanks, many of the former, and all the latter, being submerged during the rains; its waters are extremely muddy, and the mud is carried far out to sea. The river commences to rise in March; about June, after a fall, it steadily rises again, and attains its maximum height about September. At Prome, in September, it is from 33 to 40 feet above its dry-season level. Below the latitude of Myan-aung, the Irawadi inundates large tracts of country on its eastern or unprotected bank. Several contradictory calculations have been made of its discharge. The average annual discharge, according to Mr. Gordon's observations, and calculated in metre-tons of 37 cubic feet, is 428 billion tons.\n\nThe Irawadi is navigable at all seasons by steamers of light draught as high as Bhamo, and during the dry season, for steamers drawing 6 feet, as far as the British frontier. In the rains, steamers and large boats enter the main stream of the Irawadi from Rangoon by the Pan-hlaing or Bhawlay creeks. During the dry season they have to descend the Rangoon river for some distance, and, passing through the Bassein creek, enter the Irawadi through the To or China Bakir. In the dry season, the northern entrance to the Bassein river is entirely closed by a large sandbank. The tide is felt as far up as Henzada, and at Pu-zun-daung it rises $18\\frac{1}{2}$ feet at springs. Disastrous floods have more than once occurred in the Irawadi, the years 1871, 1875, and 1877 being remarkable in this respect. Below Akauk-taung on the west, and Prome on the east, the Irawadi receives no tributaries of importance.\n\nThe broad channel of the Irawadi has always been the sole means of communication between the interior and the seaboard. From time immemorial, the precious stones, minerals, etc. of Upper Burma and the Chinese frontier provinces have been brought down by this route. At the present day, the great bulk of the trade is in the hands of the 'Irrawaddy Flotilla Company,' an important English carrying firm; but native boats still maintain a strenuous competition. The flotilla of the Company consists of about 60 vessels, including steamers and flats. They employ about 1770 hands, European and native; and distribute in wages upwards of \u00a350,000 a year. Their head-quarters are at Rangoon, where, for the construction and repair of their large fleet, they have leased from Government the old dockyard, foundry, and engineer establishment. In 1882, the number of steamers passing up the Irawadi was 115, and passing down 110. In previous years these numbers had been larger, but as steamers have decreased in number, the tonnage and number of native craft have proportionately increased. Steamers run twice a week from Rangoon to Bassein,\nand from Rangoon to Mandalay, under contract with the Government of India for the conveyance of mails, troops, and stores. The service from Rangoon to Mandalay is continued twice a month to Bhamo, about 1000 miles from the sea. The following are the stopping stations between Rangoon and Mandalay, proceeding up-stream:\u2014Yand\u00fan, at the mouth of the Pan-hlaing creek, 50 miles above Rangoon, a large trading village; Donabyu; Henzada, a place of growing importance as a delta station for the observation of physical data connected with the Irawadi; Ye-gin, with large exports of paddy (unhusked rice) to Upper Burma; Myan-aung, the old civil station, now moved to Henzada; Prome, in former days a terminus for the steamers; Thayet-myo, the military frontier station, about 350 miles above Rangoon; Minhla, the custom-house station of Independent Burma; Magwe, a considerable centre of local trade, frequented at certain seasons by the Siamese; Ye-nan-gyaung, the shipping depot for the earth-oil or petroleum produced in large quantities at a spot 3 miles distant; Sinyugyan, Nyaungu, Kunywah, and Pokoko; Mingyan, the most important river station in Independent Burma after Mandalay, the traders being chiefly Chinese; Letsambyu and Sagaing, both only stopped at going down-stream; Mandalay, about 350 miles above Prome. The principal articles carried up-stream are Manchester piece-goods, rice, salt, hardware, and silk. The articles carried down-stream are raw cotton, cutch (a preparation from Acacia catechu for dyeing), india-rubber, jade, spices, precious stones, timber, earth-oil, and dry crops, such as wheat and peas. The value of the trade both ways is about 2\u00bd millions sterling. The latest figures (for 1881-82) show imports into Independent Burma to the value of \u00a31,044,139, against exports of \u00a31,440,982.\n\nThe total number of native boats on the Irawadi is about 9750 going up and down stream: the total number of steamers was 225 in 1882-83. The former mostly carry heavy articles of commerce, especially cutch and earth-oil. Going up-stream, they take advantage of the wind, spreading a single enormous sail on a yard sometimes 120 feet long. The Burmese are good river sailors, but generally hug the bank closely. Going down-stream, they take advantage of the full strength of the current, by throwing overboard branches of trees attached to the prow, which float down faster than the boat itself. The Rangoon and Irawadi State Railway was opened for traffic as far as Prome (161 miles) on 1st May 1877. The total sum expended on this line up to the end of 1881-82 was \u00a31,287,795. A further extension of 42 miles to Allan-myo is under consideration.\n\nIr\u00edch.\u2014Ancient town in Jh\u00e1nsi District, North-Western Provinces. Lies in lat. 25\u00b0 47' N., and long. 79\u00b0 8' E., on the right bank of the Betwa, 42 miles north-east of Jh\u00e1nsi city. Population under 5000. Formerly\na town of great importance, the head-quarters of a Sark\u00e1r under the Mughal empire, but now lying in ruins, with a continually decreasing population. Many mosques and tombs still standing among the suburbs attest its early prosperity. The British army, under the Marquis of Hastings, encamped on the spot in 1817, on its advance to Gwalior, when suffering from cholera. Here also, in 1804, the British force under Major Shepherd, sent to oppose the incursions of Am\u00edr Kh\u00e1n into Jh\u00e1nsi and Tehri, awaited his approach from L\u00e1litpur. On his first advance, the Am\u00edr found himself overpowered, and retreated to M\u00e1lthaun; whereupon the British troops, thinking that he had permanently retired, marched on to Banda. Am\u00edr Kh\u00e1n shortly afterwards returned, and made Ir\u00edch his head-quarters in his expeditions against K\u00fanch and K\u00e1lpi. Manufacture of chintz and figured broad-cloth. First-class police station, school, and post-office. A small municipal income, for conservancy and police purposes, is raised under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856.\n\n**Irodu.\u2014T\u00e1luk and town, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Erode.**\n\n**Irrik\u00far.\u2014Village in Chirakkal t\u00e1luk, Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency.

A considerable entrep\u00f4t of trade, and notable as the scene of M\u00e1ppill\u00e1 (Moplah) outrages in 1852. From Irrik\u00far to the sea, the Valarpattanam river is navigable for boats throughout the year.**\n\n**Isakapalli ('Sandy Village'\u2014Telugu).\u2014Village in Nellore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 14\u00b0 44' N., long. 80\u00b0 8' E. Population (1881) 1966. A seaport and customs station; formerly carried on a large trade in salt, but the competition of other salt-works has caused the trade to decay. There are granaries and godowns on the beach for the storage of grain. Good anchorage for large sailing vessels and steamers. Connected with Nellore town, 23 miles distant, by a metalled road.**\n\n**Is\u00e1khel.\u2014Tahsil of Bannu District, Punjab, consisting of a tract shut in between the Chich\u00e1li and Maid\u00e1ni ranges and the river Indus. Its extreme northern portion, known as the Bhanji Khel country, is a wild and rugged region, a continuation of the Khatak Hills. The Bhanji Khels are an influential, but numerically small, section of the great Khatak tribe, and occupied their present country about 400 years ago. The tahsil derives its name from the Is\u00e1 Khel tribe, a section of the Ni\u00e1z\u00e1i Afgh\u00e1ns, which, settling here during the sixteenth century, long maintained its independence of the Mughal empire, and at last succumbed to the Naw\u00e1b of Dera Isma\u00edl Kh\u00e1n. Area, 675 square miles. Average area under crops (1877 to 1881), 128 square miles. Area under principal crops\u2014Wheat, 35,782 acres; barley, 11,197 acres; and b\u00e1jra, 29,320 acres. Total area assessed for Government revenue,\n432,016 acres; total revenue of the tahsil, \u00a36361. Population (1881) 59,546, namely, 53,982 Muhammadans, 5408 Hindus, 78 Sikhs, 60 Jains, and 18 Christians; persons per square mile, 88; number of towns and villages, 47, of which 18 contained less than five hundred inhabitants. The landholders are mostly of the Ni\u00e1z\u00e1i tribe; but during their long residence in the valley of the Indus, they have lost their mother tongue, Pushtu, and now use only the Punjab\u00ed dialect of their tenants. The tahsil contains 1 civil and 1 criminal court; 2 police stations, with a regular police force of 53 men, and a village watch of 80 men.\n\nIs\u00e1khel.\u2014Chief town and head-quarters of Is\u00e1khel tahsil in Bannu District, Punjab. Lat. 32\u00b0 40' 50\" N., and long. 71\u00b0 19' E., on the high right bank of the Indus, 9 miles west of the present channel; distant from Edwardes\u00e1b\u00e1d 42 miles south-east. Population (1881) 6692, namely, 1788 Hindus, 4895 Muhammadans, and 9 Sikhs. Founded about 1830 by Ahmad Kh\u00e1n, ancestor of the present leading family. Built without plan; b\u00e1z\u00e1r and lanes crooked, narrow, and extremely dirty. Small local trade. The Kh\u00e1ns of Is\u00e1khel are the acknowledged heads of the trans-Indus Ni\u00e1z\u00e1s. Tahs\u00edl, old fort used as police station, staging bungalow, sar\u00e1\u00ed, and dispensary. A third-class municipality, with an income in 1881-82 of \u00a3356; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 0\u00bdd. per head of the population.\n\nIs\u00e1nagar.\u2014Village in Kheri District, Oudh; situated about 4 miles west of the Kauri\u00e1la river. The head-quarters of the Is\u00e1nagar estate. Population (1881) 2589 Hindus and 609 Muhammadans\u2014total, 3198. Small market.\n\nIsarda.\u2014Town in Jaipur (Jeypore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; situated near the banks of the Ban\u00e1s, about 60 miles south from Jaipur city. It has a citadel, and is surrounded by a wall and moat. Population inconsiderable.\n\nIsauli.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Mus\u00e1firkh\u00e1na tahsil, Sult\u00e1npur District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Paschimr\u00e1th and Khand\u00e1usa pargan\u00e1s, on the east by pargan\u00e1 Sult\u00e1npur Baraunsa, on the south by Amethi and Sult\u00e1npur pargan\u00e1s, and on the west by Jagd\u00edspur pargan\u00e1. Originally in the possession of the Bhars, who were ousted about 550 years ago by a party of Bais Kshattriy\u00e1s, on whom Sult\u00e1n Al\u00e1-ud-din Khilj\u00ed bestowed the title of Bh\u00e1le Sult\u00e1n, which their descendants still retain. Area, 148 square miles, or 94,743 acres, of which 53,749 are cultivated, 16,613 cultivable, 7600 under groves, and the remainder barren. Government land revenue, \u00a39772, or an average of 2s. 1d. per acre. Population (1881) 73,593 Hindus, 9749 Muhammadans\u2014total, 83,342, namely, 40,374 males and 42,968 females. Number of villages, 184; average density of population, 563 per square mile.\nIskardo (or Skardo). \u2014 Principal town of the province of Balti, Kashmir State; situated in lat. $35^\\circ 12'$ N., and long. $75^\\circ 35'$ E., on an elevated plain, 19 miles long and 7 broad; 7700 feet above sea-level, at the bottom of a valley, surrounded by lofty mountains. The fort, occupying a rock of gneiss at the confluence of the Indus (here 150 yards broad) with its great tributary the Sheg\u00e1r, is near the magnificent gorge through which the Indus issues from the western ranges of the Him\u00e1layas. The cliff on which the fort is built rises to a sheer height of 800 feet above the river, and presents a perpendicular face on every side, except the west, where it slopes rapidly toward the plain. Vigne compares the site to that of Gibraltar, and believes that it could be rendered equally impregnable. The castle of the late princes of Baltist\u00e1n crowns a small natural platform, 300 feet above the river, and shows by its construction that defence rather than comfort was its chief object. The collection of straggling huts below the fort and castle scarcely deserves the name of town. Ahmad Sh\u00e1h, the last native prince, bore an excellent character as a just and moderate ruler. His country finally fell into the hands of Gul\u00e1b Singh of Kashmir, who annexed it to his dominions.\n\nIsl\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Chief town of Chittagong District, Bengal. \u2014 See CHITTAGONG.\n\nIsl\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Town in Kashmir State. Lies in lat. $33^\\circ 43'$ N., long. $75^\\circ 17'$ E., on the north bank of the Jehlam (Jhelum), here about 80 yards wide, and crossed by a wooden bridge. Isl\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1d crowns the summit of a long low ridge, extending from the mountains eastward. Below the ridge a low reservoir contains a spring of clear water, slightly sulphurous, from which volumes of gas exhale. A legend connects the origin of the spring with a creative act of Vishnu. The water swarms with sacred fish. Large manufacture of Kashmir shawls, also of chintzes, cotton, and woollen goods. The original name of Anat N\u00e1g, derived from the holy reservoir, gave place to Isl\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1d in the 15th century. Here the Hindu pilgrims to the famous shrine of Siva at Ambarn\u00e1th, 60 miles distant, halt to take in a supply of provisions for their journey. Isl\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1d is the second town in Kashmir, and is the terminus of the upper navigation of the Jehlam. It is described by recent travellers as a miserable place of about 1500 houses, but supporting as many as fifteen Muhammadan temples. Crocus flowers are grown for saffron, which is largely used as medicine, and for the making of caste marks on the foreheads of orthodox Hindus. In good seasons about 20,000 lbs. of saffron are secured.\n\nIsl\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1d Bijhauli.\u2014Village in Unao District, Oudh; about 20 miles from Safipur, and 27 from Unao town, in a north-westerly direction. Population (1881) 2163 Hindus and 161 Muhammadans\u2014total, 2324,\nresiding in 369 houses. Government school. Seat of 3 small annual religious trading fairs.\n\n**Isl\u00e1mgarh** (or *Nohar*).\u2014Fort in Bah\u00e1walpur State, Punjab, close to the borders of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Lat. $27^\\circ 50'$ N., long. $70^\\circ 52'$ E.; lies on the route from Kh\u00e1npur to Jaisalmer (Jeysulmere), 65 miles north of the latter town. Consists of an ancient structure of small bricks, about 80 yards square, with lofty ramparts, from 30 to 50 feet in height. The situation is unfavourable for defence, being surrounded on every side by sandhills of considerable elevation. A few buildings occupy the enclosed space, while some straggling houses lie without the wall. The fort formerly belonged to Jaisalmer (Jeysulmere), but was wrested from the R\u00e1jputs by the Kh\u00e1n of Bah\u00e1walpur.\n\n**Isl\u00e1mkot.**\u2014Town in the Mitti *t\u00e1luk*, Thar and P\u00e1rkar District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Lat. $24^\\circ 41'$ $30''$ N., and long. $70^\\circ 13'$ E. Population (1872) 862; not over 2000 in 1881. The municipal revenue in 1873\u201374 was \u00a348, but the municipality was abolished in 1878 on the introduction into Sind of Bombay Act vi. of 1873. An old native fort stands outside the town. Isl\u00e1mkot is connected by good roads with the neighbouring villages.\n\n**Isl\u00e1mnagar.**\u2014Town in Bisauli *tahsil*, Bud\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces.

The town contains a second-class police station, post-office, dispensary, *sardi* or native inn, cattle pound, and school. A market is held every Monday and Friday. For police and conservancy purposes, a small house-tax is levied under the provisions of Act xx. of 1865. The outskirts of the town are well planted with groves of mango trees.\n\n**Isl\u00e1mpur.**\u2014Town and municipality in the W\u00e1lwa Sub-division of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District, Bombay Presidency. Population (1872) 8390; (1881) 8949, namely, Hindus, 7801; Muhammadans, 771; Jains, 377. Area of town site, 115 acres. The income of the municipality was \u00a3318 in 1882\u201383; incidence of municipal taxation, 4s. 7d. per head.\n\n**It\u00e1.**\u2014Small detached group of hills in the centre of Sylhet District, Assam. Area, about 49 square miles; highest point, 300 feet above sea-level.

Population (1881) 2138, namely, Hindus, 1820; Muhammadans, 147; Jains, 8; aboriginal tribes, 163.\nIt\u00e1wa.\u2014Estate in Khur\u00e1i tahsil, S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) District, Central Provinces; 48 miles north-west of S\u00e1g\u00e1r town, containing 44 villages, on an area of 77 square miles. At the cession of S\u00e1g\u00e1r to the British Government by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in 1818, this tract, which then consisted of 46 villages, yielding \u00a3896 per annum, was assigned rent free for life to R\u00e1m Bh\u00e1\u00fa, a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Pandit, in lieu of Malh\u00e1rgarh and Kanji\u00e1, the former being an estate in the extreme north-west of S\u00e1g\u00e1r District, beyond the Betwa river, which was made over to Sindhia. At the late settlement, 16 villages were awarded to the t\u00edlukd\u00e1r in proprietary right, and in 28 villages he received the superior proprietary right only. The chief village contained (in 1881) 540 houses, with a population of 2177. Hindus numbered 1786; Muhammadans, 122; and Jains, 269. It is said to have been founded by Indraj\u00edt, a Bundel\u00e1 officer of Akbar, and at the beginning of the 18th century was held by D\u00edw\u00e1n Anup Singh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Pann\u00e1, who built the small fort and embellished the town. In 1751 he made over the place to the Peshw\u00e1, in return for assistance against the Bundel\u00e1s. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s improved the fort and town, and some of the buildings contain remarkably fine stonework and carving. The chief sales at the weekly market consist of grain and native cloths. Two schools for boys and girls.\n\nItkuri.\u2014Coal-field in Haz\u00e1rib\u00e1gh District, Bengal; situated in the valley of the Moh\u00e1ni river. Greatest length, 15 miles; average breadth, 1\u00bd mile. The coal is only worth working for rough purposes, and the average is considered to contain more than 30 per cent. of ash. The coal-bearing area is very small, but its position and the metalled way connecting it with the Grand Trunk Road are points in its favour. An approximate estimate gives the amount of coal available at from a million and a half to two millions of tons.\n\nItri\u00e1 Gadh\u00e1la.\u2014Petty State in North K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency; 14 miles north-west of Dhasa railway station. The State consists of 2 villages, with 1 separate tribute-payer. Population, 774 in 1872, and 909 in 1881. The revenue is estimated at \u00a3400; tribute of \u00a325, 4s. is paid to the British Government, and of \u00a38, 6s. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\nIttamukkal\u00e1 ('Date-Palm Place'\u2014Telugu).\u2014Town in Ongole t\u00edluk, Nellore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 15\u00b0 22' 30\" N., and long. 80\u00b0 9' 11\" E. Population (1872) 3811; (1881) 3028. Seaport with coasting trade, and the second customs station in the District. In 1880, the value of the exports was \u00a370; imports, \u00a3206. The assistant-superintendent of sea customs at Ittamukkal\u00e1 has power to grant ships' papers, and thus save the delay of reference to the principal port, Kottapatnam. The anchorage is good.\n\nItw\u00e1d.\u2014Petty State of the P\u00e1ndu Mehw\u00e1s, in Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency.

Tribute of \u00a360 is paid to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda.\n\n**Iviker** (or *Aibik\u00e1*).\u2014Town in Travancore State, Madras Presidency; situated on the sea-coast in lat. 8\u00b0 57' N., and long. 76\u00b0 37' E., at the mouth of the river Aibik\u00e1, which is navigable only by small craft. Export trade in timber, spices, and lac. Distance from Quilon town, 5 miles.\n\n---\n\n**J.**\n\n**Jabalpur** (*Jubbulpore*).\u2014One of the four Divisions or Commissionerships of the Central Provinces, comprising the Districts of Jabalpur, Sagar (Saugor), Damoh, Seoni, and Mandla. Area, 18,688 square miles, with 11 towns and 8501 villages; houses, 504,080. Total population (1881) 2,201,633, namely, 1,128,083 males and 1,073,550 females; average density of population, 117\u00b78; towns and villages per square mile, 0\u00b746; persons per village, 259; houses per square mile, 27; persons per house, 4\u00b737. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 1,655,103, or 75\u00b718 per cent.; Sikhs, 47; Kabirpanthis, 25,014, or 1\u00b713 per cent.; Satn\u00e1m\u00eds, 702; Muhammadans, 87,060, or 3\u00b795 per cent.; Christians, 3769; Buddhists, 11; Jains, 30,295, or 1\u00b738 per cent.; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 69; non-Hindu aborigines, 399,559, or 18\u00b713 per cent.; and unspecified, 4. Total adult agriculturists, 763,871, or 34\u00b770 per cent. of the total divisional population, the average area of cultivated and cultivable land being 10 acres per adult agriculturist. Of the total area of 18,688 square miles, 12,833 square miles are assessed for Government revenue, of which 5483 square miles were returned in 1881 as under cultivation; 3956 square miles as cultivable; and 3394 as uncultivable. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses on land, \u00a3162,739, or an average of 9\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total amount of rent actually paid by cultivators, \u00a3417,707, or an average of 2s. 3\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Justice is afforded by 38 civil and 29 criminal courts. Number of police stations (*th\u00e1n\u00e1s*), 49, besides 133 outpost stations. Total revenue of the Division in 1882-83, \u00a3194,242.\n\n**Jabalpur** (*Jubbulpore*).\u2014District in the Chief Commissionership of the Central Provinces, lying between 21\u00b0 12' and 23\u00b0 56' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 40' and 81\u00b0 35' E. long. Bounded on the north by Pann\u00e1 and Maihar States; on the east by Rew\u00e1 State; on the south by the British Districts of Mandl\u00e1, Seoni, and Narsinghpur; and on the west by Damoh District. Area, 3918 square miles; population in 1881, 687,233. The administrative head-quarters of the District are at Jabalpur, which is also the principal town.\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Jabalpur consists of a long, narrow plain, running north-east and south-west, and shut in on all sides by highlands, forming an offshoot from the great valley of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda). This plain is covered in its western and southern portions by a rich alluvial deposit of black cotton-soil, merging towards the north-east in an undulating tract of metamorphic and lateritic formation. The south-eastern parts, lying parallel with the black-soil country, belong to the great trappean area of Central India. Granitic rocks occupy larger areas than elsewhere. Near Jabalpur town the granite forms a range of low hills running from the Narbad\u00e1 towards the north-east, and attaining its highest point near the ancient town of Garh\u00e1, where it is crowned by a ruined building called the Madan Mah\u00e1l. Here the hilly area of the granite extends over about 2 miles, consisting chiefly, says Mr. J. G. Medlicott, of \u2018a porphyritic syenite, whose matrix is a mixture of glassy quartz, with pale pink or pale green felspar, along with a small proportion of hornblende, and which contains embedded crystals of dull lead-grey felspar (adularia), about one-third of an inch long, and in great number, frequently forming a large proportion of the mass.\u2019 At Jabalpur itself the soil is sandy, and water plentiful near the surface; so that even in the sultry blaze of an Indian summer there still appear a freshness and verdure such as no station situated on basaltic soil can enjoy.\n\nThe highlands in the distance relieve the monotony of the fertile plain. On the north and west the Bh\u00e1nrer Hills, which belong to the Vindhyan sandstone series, and the low rocky K\u00e1imur chain, on the east the Bhitr\u00edgarh heights, and on the south spurs and ridges projecting from the Gondw\u00e1n\u00e1 range, ring in the District with a border of picturesque scenery, in which hill and valley, forest and stream, succeed each other in rapid variety. The Bh\u00e1nrer and K\u00e1imur chains form a watershed, the northern side of which is drained by the Ganges. The other and more important watershed of the District starts from the Bhitr\u00edgarh range, and crosses the Great Northern Road between Sleeman\u00e1b\u00e1d and Sihora. Rain falling to the north and east finds its way into tributaries either of the Ganges or the Jumna, while rivulets rising on the south and west swell the rapid stream of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda). Thus, the traveller from Jabalpur to M\u00edrz\u00e1pur passes over the great watershed between the Gulf of Cambay and the Bay of Bengal. The principal rivers are the Mah\u00e1nadi (not to be confounded with the more important river of that name), which, rising in Mandl\u00e1 District, flows in a northerly direction till near Bijer\u00e1ghogarh it bends towards the east and falls into the Son (Soane); the Gurayy\u00e1, between Jabalpur and Damoh; the Patn\u00e1, which separates the District from Pann\u00e1; and the Hiran, which flows into the Narbad\u00e1 at S\u00e1nkal. But besides these streams, the Narbad\u00e1 flows through\nthe District for 70 miles from east to west, passing about 9 miles below Jabalpur town through the famous Marble Rocks. There the river, which above this point had attained a breadth of 100 yards, flings itself tumultuously from a rocky ledge with a fall of 30 feet, called Dhu\u00e1n-dh\u00e1r or the Misty Shoot, and then flows on in a deep and narrow channel nearly 2 miles long, through a mass of beautifully white limestone. On each side, a dazzling row of marble bluffs, rising sheer up to a height of 100 feet, confines the swirling waters.\n\nHistory. \u2014 The early history of Jabalpur is unknown; but inscriptions record the existence during the 11th and 12th centuries of a local line of princes of that Haihai race which is so closely connected with the history of Gondw\u00e1n\u00e1. In the 16th century, Sangr\u00e1ni S\u00e1, the Gond R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Garh\u00e1 Mandl\u00e1, extended his power over fifty-two Districts, including the present Jabalpur. During the minority of his grandson, Prem N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, the Gond Queen Durg\u00e1vat\u00ed administered the government. The rule of a woman appeared a favourable time for aggression; and Asaf Kh\u00e1n, the Viceroy of Kara M\u00e1nikpur on the Ganges, sought and obtained permission to conquer the Garh\u00e1 principality. The decisive battle was fought under the castle of Singaurgarh, and Asaf Kh\u00e1n proved victorious. Stung by her defeat, the high-spirited Durg\u00e1vat\u00ed put an end to her life. At first Asaf Kh\u00e1n held Garh\u00e1 as an independent ruler, but eventually he resigned his pretensions, and submitted himself to the Emperor Akbar. In the list of Akbar's dominions given in the Ain-i-Akbari, Garh\u00e1 appears as a division of the Government of M\u00e1lw\u00e1. The Delhi power, however, enjoyed little more than a nominal supremacy; and the princes of Garh\u00e1 Mandl\u00e1 maintained a practical independence until their subjugation by the Governors of S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) in 1781. Though Bakht Buland never brought Jabalpur under his sway, this District, like the rest of Gondw\u00e1n\u00e1, felt the effects of his liberal and enlightened policy; and it was in his time that the industrious Lodhis and K\u00e1yasths settled here.\n\nIn 1798, the Peshw\u00e1 granted Mandl\u00e1 and the Narbad\u00e1 valley to the Bhonsla Princes of N\u00e1gpur, who continued to hold the District until the British occupied it after an engagement on the 19th December 1817. By the provisional Government then formed, Raghu\u0144\u00e1th R\u00e1o, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ingl\u00e1, was appointed acting sub\u00e1hd\u00e1r; and a petition which he presented throws a curious light upon the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 system of rule. The sub\u00e1hd\u00e1r inquired whether all widows were still to be sold, and the purchase money paid into the treasury? whether all persons receiving any moneys through an order, or by the interposition, of any person in office, should still pay one-fourth of such moneys to the State? and whether any person selling his house or his daughter should still pay to the State one-fourth of the purchase money? These rules the British had found\nin full force; and one of the earliest acts of the provisional Government was to order the release of a young woman named Pursi\u00e1, who had been sold by auction for \u00a31, 14s. At first, the S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Narbad\u00e1 territories were governed by a Commissioner in subordination to the Resident at N\u00e1gpur. Subsequently, these Districts were separated from the N\u00e1gpur Agency; and in 1843 Lord Ellenborough recast the whole system of administration. The chief feature of his reforms was the separation of the judicature from the departments of revenue and police. The system which he instituted lasted until November 1861, when Jabalpur was formed into a District of the Central Provinces, under the control of a Chief Commissioner resident at N\u00e1gpur.\n\nPopulation.\u2014In 1872, the population of the District, with an area the same as at present, was returned at 528,859. In 1881, the total population amounted to 687,233, showing an increase of 158,374, or 29'9 per cent. in the nine years. This large increase, apart from the normal growth of the population in prosperous years, is stated to be partially due to the gradual return of famine-stricken peasantry who fled the District at the time of the scarcity of 1869; to a large immigration from neighbouring Native States, induced by the spread of cultivation and the opening of public works; and also (to the extent of about 3 per cent.) to defective enumeration in 1872. The Census of 1881 disclosed a population of 687,233 persons, on an area of 3918 square miles, residing in 2310 villages or towns, and 174,512 houses; persons per square mile, 175'4; villages per square mile, 0'59; houses per square mile, 44'54; persons per village, 298; persons per house, 3'9. Classified according to sex\u2014males, 349,251; females, 337,982. According to age\u2014the male children under 12 numbered 117,279; the female children, 112,604.\n\nThe ethnical division of the population is as follows:\u2014Europeans, 1125; Eurasians, 267; Indo-Portuguese, 30; non-Hindu aboriginal tribes, 67,804; Hindus and people of Hindu origin, including aboriginal tribes which have embraced Hinduism, and Christians who are Hindus by descent, 565,361; Muhammadans, 34,790; Buddhists and Jains, 5515; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 51; and \u2018others\u2019 and unspecified, 337. The most numerous of the aboriginal tribes, Hindu and non-Hindu, are the Gonds, 98,384, and Kols, 46,383; the remainder consist of Bharias, B\u00e1igas, etc. Among the higher classes of Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans numbered 60,420; R\u00e1jputs, 19,910; and K\u00e1yasths, 5278. The Baniy\u00e1s or trading caste numbered 11,923. The other numerically important castes are the Lodh\u00eds, 45,760; Kurmis, 34,513; Ah\u00edrs or Gaul\u00eds, 32,911; Cham\u00e1rs, 32,905; Dhim\u00e1rs, 29,278; Kachh\u00eds, 25,945; Tel\u00eds, 17,817; Mehras, 14,037; Koer\u00eds, 11,558; Loh\u00e1rs, 10,484; N\u00e1is, 10,832; Kumbh\u00e1rs, 9786; and Gadariy\u00e1s, 6559. The Muhammadan population are divided according to sect\ninto\u2014Sunn\u00eds, 33,452; Shi\u00e1s, 418; and \u2018others,\u2019 920. The Christians include\u2014Church of England, 855; Roman Catholics, 1094; Presbyterians, 83; Protestants not otherwise distinguished, 357; etc. Native Christians numbered 721. The language commonly spoken is the Hind\u00ed dialect known as Baghel\u00e1, a peculiarity of which is the elision of nearly all short vowels; but Urd\u00fa is generally understood, and is the language of the courts.\n\nDivision into Town and Country.\u2014The only towns in Jabalpur District in 1881 were Jabalpur, with a population of 75,705; Murwara, 8612; and Sihora, 5736. These towns, which are also the only municipalities, contain an aggregate urban population of 90,053, leaving 597,180, or 87 per cent., as representing the rural population. Of the 2310 towns and villages in 1881, 1307 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 737 between two and five hundred; 218 between five hundred and a thousand; 32 between one and two thousand; 10 between two and three thousand; 3 between three and five thousand; 2 between five and ten thousand; and 1 upwards of fifty thousand.\n\nAs regards occupation, the male population is classified as follows in the Census Report of 1881:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including Government officials and professions, 9022; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 4850; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 7244; (4) agricultural and pastoral, 140,342; (5) industrial, including all manufacturers and artisans, 48,144; (6) indefinite and non-productive, comprising general labourers, male children, and unspecified, 139,649.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of 3918 square miles, only 1563 were cultivated in 1882; and of the portion lying waste, 1115 square miles were returned as cultivable, and 1240 square miles as uncultivable waste. Total area assessed for Government revenue, 3456 square miles. Of the cultivated land, 3824 acres are irrigated\u2014entirely by private enterprise. Cereals constitute the principal crop, 352,883 acres being devoted in 1881-82 to wheat, and 430,352 to inferior food-grains. The production of rice has decreased, occupying 124,409 acres in 1881-82, as against 155,894 acres in 1876. The area under cotton has also fallen off from 28,027 acres in 1872, to 22,919 in 1882. During the same period, the area of land devoted to the growth of oil-seeds has more than doubled, being returned at 42,215 acres in 1872, 91,362 acres in 1876, and 101,753 acres in 1881-82. The District is rich in garden produce, raising, in addition to the ordinary Indian fruits, peaches and pine-apples and strawberries, as well as potatoes of an excellent quality. Both the plain country and the highlands are well wooded; and the forest produce is of considerable value, consisting of lac and gum, and silk from the cocoons of the tasar moth. The timber has suffered greatly from fires caused either by\naccident or by the annual burnings of the hill tribes; since, where these conflagrations do not destroy, they effectually scar the bark of the young teak tree. The Forest Department now use every means to prevent this destruction; and tracts of forest land in the Sangr\u00e1mpur valley, and on the west bank of the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di in Bijer\u00e1ghogarh, have been marked off as State reserves.\n\nThe Census of 1881 showed a total of 6946 proprietors. The tenant cultivators numbered 157,121, of whom 24,226 had either absolute or occupancy rights, while 36,331 were tenants-at-will. The remaining tenants consist mostly of assistants in home cultivation, cultivators on sharing tenures, etc. Agricultural labourers numbered 76,991. The total adult agriculturists of all classes amounted to 241,847, or 35\u00b719 per cent. of the District population, the average area of cultivated and cultivable land being 7 acres for each adult agriculturist. Amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses paid on land, \u00a361,167, or an average of 1s. 1\u00bcd. per cultivated acre. Total rental paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a3169,171, or an average of 3s. 1\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. The rent rates per acre in 1882 for the different qualities of land are returned as follows:\u2014Land suited for wheat, 4s. 6d.; for inferior grains, 1s. 3d.; for rice, 3s. 6d.; for cotton, 3s.; for oil-seeds, 1s. 6d.; the average produce per acre being\u2014wheat, 542 lbs.; inferior grain, 299 lbs.; rice, 216 lbs.; cotton, 67 lbs.; and oil-seeds, 242 lbs. The ordinary prices of produce in the same year were as follows:\u2014Wheat, 5s. 3d. per cwt.; rice, 7s. per cwt.; cotton, 42s. per cwt.; and linseed, 7s. per cwt. The daily wages for skilled labour averaged 9d.; for unskilled labour, 4d.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The famine of 1869, and the disease which accompanied and followed it, visited this densely populated District with greater severity than any other part of the Central Provinces. On comparing the Census of 1872 with that for 1866, the population of Jabalpur is found to have decreased by 70,358; and this diminution must to a great degree be accounted for by the calamities of 1869. Large numbers of persons fled the District in search of more favoured localities, but the survivors mostly returned on the cessation of the distress, and the Census of 1881 showed an increased population of 158,374 over that of 1872. It may be hoped that the improved means of communication in the District will hereafter avert the extremity of famine by importation from other tracts.\n\nCommerce and Manufactures.\u2014The trade of the District centres at Jabalpur town, which is one of the most important railway centres in India. One of the chief manufactures is iron. The most productive mines are at Jauli, Agari\u00e1, Saroli, and Part\u00e1bpur. The total number of these mines worked in 1882 was 48. Coal is found at R\u00e1mgh\u00e1t, Bheragh\u00e1t, and near Sing\u00e1pur on the Mah\u00e1n\u00e1di; but the most\npromising seam occurs near Lamet\u00e1gh\u00e1t. This coal was worked for a short time in 1868 by a railway contractor, and about 1000 tons extracted. The contractor, however, died, and the seam has been abandoned. Further examinations are being made by the Geological Survey Department. The limestone of the hills at Bheragh\u00e1t has a high reputation; and Murw\u00e1r\u00e1 supplies a limestone said to be suited for lithographic purposes, which fetches a high price in the Calcutta market. The other manufactures of the District consist of brass utensils, cotton cloth, and leather articles. Tents and carpets also are made at Jabalpur, both in the School of Industry and by private persons.\n\nThere were, in 1882, 303 miles of roads in the District, entirely of the second class. The best are those to M\u00edrz\u00e1pur on the north, and to Seoni on the south, the former of which is one long avenue of trees. Fair-weather roads lead to S\u00e1g\u00e1r and to Narsinghpur; and the route to Mandl\u00e1 has lately been improved. The District enjoys no means of communication by water; but the railroad amply compensates for this deficiency.\n\nJabalpur town is perhaps the most important railway station in India, being the junction of the East Indian and Great Indian Peninsula systems. The Jabalpur branch of the East Indian line runs north-east to Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. Its total length is 228 miles. This branch was opened for traffic on 1st June 1867. The main line of the Great Indian Peninsula runs south-west to Bombay, following for some distance the valley of the Narbad\u00e1. This line was not opened throughout until 1872. It now forms the regular channel of communication between Bombay and Calcutta, and between Bombay and the North-West. The railway crosses the rocky bed of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) near Jh\u00e1nsigh\u00e1t by a viaduct 371 yards long.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1861, Jabalpur was formed into a separate District of the British Government of the Central Provinces. It is administered by a Deputy Commissioner with Assistants and tahsild\u00e1rs. Total revenue in 1876\u201377, \u00a376,013, of which the land yielded \u00a357,188. The revenue of the District in 1882 had increased to \u00a389,246, the land yielding \u00a357,540. Number of civil and revenue judges (1882), 13; magistrates, 19; maximum distance from any village to the nearest court, 40 miles; average distance, 18 miles. Number of police, 722, being 1 policeman to every 5'4 square miles and to every 952 inhabitants. The daily average number of convicts in jail in 1882 was 1055, of whom 70 were females. The number of Government or aided schools in the District under Government inspection was 157, attended by 8977 pupils. Besides youths at school, the Census Report of 1881 returned 18,117 males and 666 females as able to read and write, but not under instruction. The Jabalpur High School has proved most successful; and at the training school for mistresses an attempt has\nbeen made to solve the difficult problem of providing a teaching staff for girls, by inducing the wives of normal school students to qualify. The three municipalities contain an aggregate population of 90,053 persons; the total municipal income in 1881 was \u00a311,912, of which \u00a39879 was derived from taxation; expenditure, \u00a315,923; average rate of municipal taxation, 2s. 2\u00bdd. per head of the population.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate is healthy, and the temperature extremely moderate. Near Kundam the thermometer has been recorded as low as 26\u00b0. In 1882, the readings in the shade at the civil station were as follows:\u2014May, highest 111\u00b09 F., lowest 68\u00b09; July, highest 92\u00b04, lowest 70\u00b01; December, highest 82\u00b08, lowest 41\u00b02. As a rule, the hot weather extends only over two months, and, except immediately before the rains, is not oppressive. The rains last from early in June until the latter part of September. The prevailing winds are westerly. The average annual rainfall is returned at 52\u00b013 inches, the rainfall in 1882 being as much as 67\u00b075 inches, or 15\u00b062 inches above the average. February and March rarely pass without the rabi crops suffering from hailstorms. The prevailing diseases of the District are fevers and dysentery, the former being severest from the beginning of the rains to the end of November. Cholera and smallpox are occasional visitants, and influenza at times assumes the character of an epidemic. During the five years ending 1882, the recorded death-rate per thousand of the population averaged 37\u00b087; in 1882, it was as high as 40\u00b084. During the same year, 7 charitable dispensaries afforded medical relief to 47,192 in-door and out-door patients.

The town itself is modern, and laid out in wide and regular streets. The principal approach lies near a public garden, and in the centre of the town is a fine tank surrounded by groups of temples. A streamlet called the Umti separates the civil station and cantonment from the town. Jabalpur contains a School of Industry, where Thug and Dacoit approvers and their families are employed in one of the largest manufactories of tents and carpets in India. The garrison consists of the head-quarters and six companies of a European infantry regiment, a regiment of Native infantry, and a squadron of Native cavalry.\n\nThe opening of the railway system has immensely developed the trade of Jabalpur, which has now become the most important centre of commerce in the Central Provinces after Kampti. In 1875-76, the total imports into Jabalpur were valued at \u00a3567,000. In 1881-82, the total imports into the District were valued at \u00a31,051,472, the chief items being\u2014European piece-goods, \u00a3118,170; wheat, \u00a3167,012; inferior food-grains, \u00a321,256; metals, \u00a3129,866; sugar, \u00a355,495; salt, \u00a336,769; rice, \u00a34036; native piece-goods, \u00a317,370; oil-seeds, \u00a353,637; spices, \u00a341,211; ghi and oil, \u00a317,689; lac, \u00a316,456; raw cotton, \u00a312,491.

There is also a large road traffic with the neighbouring Districts of Seoni, Damoh, and Mandla, which draw most of their supplies from Jabalpur city.\n\n**Jabria Bhil.**\u2014Guaranteed Girasia Thakurat, or chiefship, under the Bhopal Agency of Central India. On the settlement of Malwa, Rajan Khan, brother of the notorious Pindari marauder, Chit\u00fa, was allowed a pension, afterwards commuted for an assignment of lands in Sujawalpur for life. The grant consisted of a j\u00e1gir of three villages\u2014Piplianagar, Kajuri, and Jabria Bhil\u2014and an istimr\u00e1ri farm (assessed in perpetuity) of Dungria and Jabri at an annual rent of \u00a350. At the death of Rajan Khan, in consideration of his good conduct during the latter part of his life, the grant was perpetuated, and divided among his five sons, of whom Raj\u00e1 Bakhsh received Jabria Bhil and Jabri. Raj\u00e1 Bakhsh died in 1874, and was succeeded by his son, Jamal Bakhsh, the present holder. Jamal Bakhsh pays \u00a325 a year tribute to Sindhia, Raj\u00e1 of Gwalior.\n\n**Jabuah.**\u2014State in Malwa, Central India.\u2014See Jhabua.\n\n**Jacobabad.**\u2014T\u00e1luk in the Frontier District of Upper Sind, Bombay Presidency.

Prior to the Sikh invasions, Jag\u00e1dhri was a mere village; but R\u00e1i Singh of B\u00faria, the Sikh conqueror, encouraged the commercial and manufacturing classes to settle on the spot, so that a considerable trade rapidly sprang up, and it is now a town of considerable importance. It was destroyed by N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h during one of his incursions, but rebuilt in 1783 by R\u00e1i Singh. The town lapsed to the British Government, together with the territory whose capital it formed, in 1829.

During the Bhar supremacy, this part of the country consisted of two pargan\u00e1s, S\u00e1than and Kishni. On the extirpation of the Bhars by the Musalm\u00e1ns, these divisions were amalgamated, and the head-quarters fixed at Jagd\u00edspur, which gave its name to the pargan\u00e1.

Area of town site, 9160 acres. Jaggayyapet is a prosperous trading and weaving town near the main road between Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyderabad) and Masulipatam, and close to the frontiers of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions\u2014a position which until recently laid it open to the plundering inroads of Rohill\u00e1 bands. The traders are chiefly M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri settlers from the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d country. The chief staple is opium. Jaggayyapet is the station of a sub-magistrate. The town is walled in by a decayed mud embankment. It was formerly called Betavolu, until Vasireddi Venkat\u00e1dri Naidu enclosed it with a wall, and called it after the name of his father Jaggayya. Geologically the place is of interest as the extreme north-east corner of the great Cuddapah-Kurnool rock series, and as the supposed site of a coal-field, though the existence of a coal-field is not admitted by the Geological Survey. Near the town in 1882 were found the remains of a Buddhist st\u00fapa, dating from two hundred years before the Christian era.\n\n**J\u00e1gir** (literally, \u2018A Grant of Landed Estate by the Sovereign Power\u2019).\u2014The historical name for a tract of country corresponding almost precisely with the present District of Chengalpat, Madras Presidency.

Population (1872) 400,407; (1881) 352,596, of whom 304,706, or 86.4 per cent., were Hindus; and 47,890, or 13.6 per cent., Muhammadans. The decrease of 47,811 persons, or 11.94 per cent., in nine years is mainly due to the epidemic fever which has been raging throughout the Districts of the Bardw\u00e1n and Presidency Divisions for so many years. Proportion of males, 47.4 per cent.; average density of population, 805 per square mile; villages per square mile, 1.48; persons per village, 543; houses per square mile, 175; persons per house, 5.

In 1801, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s invested the fort, and Thomas with difficulty made his escape to H\u00e1nsi, where he met with his final defeat. He then abandoned all his conquests, and retired into British territory as a private person, to die at Berhampur in Lower Bengal. A cattle fair is held here in March and October.\n\nJahazpur.\u2014Town in the Native State of Udaipur (Oodeypore), R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Jahazpur contains about 2000 houses, and lies below a fort built on an isolated hill. The hill is oblong in shape, and guards the eastern entrance of an important pass leading through the hills from B\u00fandi into Mew\u00e1r. The pargan\u00e1, of which the town is the capital, contains 100 villages, the population of which is composed entirely of the tribe of M\u00ednas. The fort is large and strong, and consists of two ramparts, one within the other, a broad space between. Each rampart has a deep ditch and numerous bastions.\n\nJahn\u00e1vi.\u2014River in Garhw\u00e1l State, North-Western Provinces, and one of the tributaries of the Bhagirathi; rises in lat. 30\u00b0 55' N., long. 79\u00b0 14' E., and, holding first a northerly and then a westerly course, joins the main stream near the temple of Bhairogh\u00e1ti. Total length, 30 miles.\n\nJaigarh (Fort Victory).\u2014Seaport and village in Ratn\u00e1giri Subdivision, Ratn\u00e1giri District, Bombay Presidency, situated in lat. 17\u00b0 17' N., and long. 73\u00b0 15' E., at the southern entrance to the Sh\u00e1stri or Sangameswar river, 99 miles south of Bombay city. It contained 2442 inhabitants in 1872, but the population is not returned separately in the Census Report of 1881. The harbour forms a bay two miles long and five miles broad, with deep water, and well protected against winds. Annual value of trade for the five years ending 1881-82, \u00a354,347, namely, exports, \u00a321,365, chiefly firewood and molasses; and imports, \u00a333,982, principally rice and salt. Jaigarh is now little more than a fishing village, with a custom-house and post-office. The fort, which occupies an area of four acres, is situated close to the shore on gently rising ground about 200 feet above the sea. The walls and bastions are, except in a few places, still in good repair, but are gradually decaying. The fort was originally built by the Bij\u00e1pur kings, and was afterwards the retreat of a noted Hindu pirate, the Naik of Sangameswar,\nwho was sufficiently powerful to resist two combined expeditions of the Portuguese and Bij\u00e1pur forces sent against him in 1583 and 1585. In 1713, Jaigarh passed into the hands of the famous Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 sea-robbler, Angria; and in June 1818, on the downfall of the Peshw\u00e1, was surrendered to the British.\n\n**Jainagar.**\u2014Town, municipality, and police station in the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 10' 55\" N., long. 88\u00b0 27' 40\" E. Population (1872) 7772; (1881) 7685, namely, Hindus, 7112, and Muhammadans, 573. Area of town site, 1200 acres. Municipal revenue (1881-82), \u00a3467; rate of taxation, 1s. 2d. per head of population; police force, 14 men. Jainagar is situated near the old bed of the Ganges, which has been dammed across, and forms at this place a continuous line of tanks, by one of which are some Hindu temples. Large b\u00e1z\u00e1r; English school under Hindu management. Communication between Jainagar and Calcutta is maintained by a small watercourse leading into Tolly's Canal; and the construction of a feeder road, from Jainagar to the Mugra station on the Diamond Harbour Railway, would bring the place within easy reach of Calcutta.\n\n**Jainagar.**\u2014Town in Darbhanga District, Bengal; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 34' 45\" N., and long. 86\u00b0 11' E., a few miles south of the Nep\u00e1l frontier, and a little east of the river Kaml\u00e1. Population (1872) 2663; (1881) 3141. Contains the ruins of a mud fort attributed to Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, Governor of Bengal, and said to have been constructed about 1573, to resist the incursions of the hill tribes. Near the fort is an encampment made by the English during the Nep\u00e1lese war. The Jainagar indigo and sugar factory is now closed. The town is in easy communication with all parts of the District.\n\n**Jaintia.**\u2014A tract of country in the Province of Assam; once a State under an independent R\u00e1j\u00e1, but now divided into the Jaintia Hills (which form part of the District of the Kh\u00e1si and Jaintia Hills) and the Jaintia plains (incorporated with Sylhet District). This article refers only to the latter tract, which contains an area of 463 square miles. It consists of the strip of low-lying country of varying width that extends between the Jaintia Hills on the north, and the main stream of the Bar\u00e1k or Surm\u00e1 river on the south.\n\nR\u00e1jendra Singh, the last R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jaintia, was a petty chief whose family had risen to importance amid the ruins of the Cachari kingdom at the close of the last century. Like the neighbouring rulers, they had adopted some form of Hinduism as their dominion became organized; and in this case, the worship of the bloodthirsty K\u00e1l\u00ed was selected as the national religion. Several shrines of this goddess in Jaintia are still frequented places of pilgrimage. The abomination of human sacrifice, which was of common occurrence, led to repeated remonstrance from the British Government. In\n1832, three British subjects were carried off from Nowgong District and immolated at a popular shrine of K\u00e1l\u00ed. R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1jendra Singh was himself charged with complicity in this outrage, and in 1835 the Governor-General issued a proclamation declaring his deposition and the annexation of the plain portion of his territory to Sylhet. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 voluntarily resigned the hill tract, and of this we also took possession. He was granted a pension of \u00a3600 a year, and resided peaceably in Sylhet until his death in 1861.\n\nBetween 1838 and 1840, the Jaintia plains were surveyed by Lieutenant (now General) Thuillier, who found the total area to be 459 square miles, of which about one-third was under cultivation. The former native Government is described as a pure despotism. The revenue was received by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 partly in produce and partly in labour, and all tenures were voidable at his will. No class of persons had any recognised rights in the land, but the more substantial cultivators called themselves mir\u00e1sd\u00e1rs, the Sylhet equivalent for zam\u00edn-d\u00e1r. Over the cultivators were officials known as chaudhar\u00eds, who acted as revenue collectors or tahsild\u00e1rs.\n\nAfter British annexation, a temporary land settlement was concluded with the cultivators for a term of five years, renewed from time to time up to April 1856, from which year a resettlement for a term of twenty years was effected. In 1853, when Mr. Mills drew up his valuable report upon Sylhet, the total land revenue paid was \u00a34455; the number of estates was 20,677, showing an average assessment of only 3s. 4d. on each estate; nearly half the estates paid less than 2s. each a year, and only 3 paid more than \u00a325. By 1874-75, the current demand of land revenue had risen to \u00a36762, and the number of estates to 21,194. A resettlement of the 18 pargan\u00e1s or fiscal divisions into which this tract is divided was commenced in 1875; but early in the following year, the work was for a time suspended, owing to the attitude of organized hostility assumed by the inhabitants of certain villages. They refused in a body to point out their lands to the am\u00edns or native surveyors, under some misapprehension of the mode in which the measurements were to be made. Argument and persuasion by the European settlement officer having been employed in vain, it was found necessary to have recourse to Act xx. of 1848, and punish the ringleaders by the imposition of daily fines. The settlement operations have since been renewed without encountering any active opposition. Further information concerning the Jaintia plains is included in the article on Sylhet District.\n\nJaintia Hills (Jowai).\u2014For administrative purposes, the Jaintia Hills are regarded as a Sub-division of the Kh\u00e1si and Jaintia Hills District, in the Province of Assam. This tract covers an area of about 2000 square miles; bounded north by the District of Nowgong (Naug\u00e1on), east by\nCachar, south by Sylhet, and west by the Kh\u00e1si Hills. The administrative head-quarters and the residence of the Assistant Commissioner are at the station of Jowai.\n\nAs compared with the semi-independent States in the Kh\u00e1si Hills, the Sub-division of the Jaintia Hills is treated as British territory, having been voluntarily surrendered by the native R\u00e1j\u00e1 in 1835 (vide Jaintia). When we first assumed charge, no change was made in the indigenous revenue system, which consisted simply in the payment of a he-goat once a year by each village. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 had derived the greater part of his income from his possessions in the plains. In 1860, however, a house-tax was imposed, the highest limit of which was 2s. per house. This measure of direct taxation was very obnoxious to the hillmen. They formed irregular gatherings, at which they refused to pay except through their own hereditary R\u00e1j\u00e1, who was then living under surveillance in Sylhet District. An outbreak took place in the beginning of the year, which was promptly suppressed, and a general disarmament was ordered. Towards the close of 1860, fresh taxation was introduced, in the form of judicial stamps and imposts upon fisheries and timber-cutting. At the same time, the elaborate schedules of the new income-tax were thrust into the hands of persons, few of whom could read the language in which they were framed. All these fiscal novelties were introduced without the safeguard that would have resulted from the presence of European officers. Towards the close of 1861, rumours of disturbance were in the air. In January 1862, the hillmen rose in open rebellion, the immediate cause being the interference of a native official with a religious ceremony. The police station at Jowai was burned to the ground, the garrison of Sepoys was closely besieged, and all show of British authority was swept away throughout the hills. The hillmen fought bravely for independence, their weapons being only bows and arrows and the dreaded p\u00e1nji or bamboo spike, stuck thickly in the paths leading to their fastnesses. At first they were successful in cutting off several detachments of Sepoys and police. Finally it was found necessary to move into the hills a regular army, including an elephant battery and two regiments of Sikhs. After operations both tedious and harassing, the last of the ringleaders was captured, and order was finally restored in March 1863.\n\nThe Jaintia Hills are divided into 23 fiscal divisions, of which 2 are inhabited by Kuki immigrants, and 2 by Mikirs. The remainder of the inhabitants are Santengs, more commonly called Syntengs, a race akin to the Kh\u00e1sis, but reported to have distinct ethnical characteristics and a language of their own. Colonel Yule, however, who travelled through the country, questions whether any real linguistic or ethnical difference exists between the Kh\u00e1sis and the Jaintias. The Census of 1881 returned the population at 56,448, of whom 47,108 were\nSantengs still professing aboriginal faiths, and 43 Kh\u00e1s\u00eds. Hindus numbered 2485; Muhammadans, 176; Christians, 648; unspecified and 'others,' 6236.\n\nThe chief crop is rice, grown in the hilly tracts on the nomadic system of agriculture known as j\u00fam, but under permanent irrigated cultivation in the valleys. In the valleys, ploughs and oxen are used; but amid the hills, the only agricultural implements are the d\u00e1o or hill knife and hoe. The most valuable natural product is limestone, which is found on the river banks at seven different places; but only two quarries are worked, the out-turn being despatched by water into Bengal from the Sylhet markets. Coal has been found of excellent quality at five spots, most of which are inaccessible to water traffic. The most extensive of the coal beds is at L\u00e1-k\u00e1-dong, within 6 miles of a navigable tributary of the Surm\u00e1. This was worked from 1850 to 1856, and about 5000 tons of coal were extracted for exportation. The Santengs, like the Kh\u00e1s\u00eds, are keen traders, and retain in their own hands the valuable commerce of their native hills. They frequent the markets at the foot of the hills on the Sylhet side. In 1876-77, the total value of the exports from the Sub-division was estimated at \u00a319,000, including 16,000 maunds of raw cotton and 5490 maunds of lac. The total imports were valued at \u00a334,560, chiefly \u00a38000 of cotton and woollen cloth, \u00a32500 of silk cloth, 15,000 maunds of rice, 6230 loads of dried fish, 5290 maunds of salt, and 609 maunds of tobacco. No later statistics are available.\n\nIn 1880-81, the total revenue of the Jaintia Hills Sub-division amounted to \u00a32366, of which \u00a31279 was derived from the house-tax. This tax is annually assessed by the head-man of each village, whose title is either dolloi or sard\u00e1r, upon every house at the rate of 2s. or 4s. These dollois or sard\u00e1rs (village heads) are elected by the different village communities, subject to the confirmation of the Deputy Commissioner. They hold office for three years, but are liable to be dismissed for misconduct at any time. Their duties are to collect the revenue, for which they are paid by a commission; and they also exercise minor criminal and police jurisdiction, with power to inflict a fine not exceeding \u00a35, liable, however, to appeal to the Deputy Commissioner.\n\nJaintiapur (or Jaintia B\u00e1z\u00e1r).\u2014Village and th\u00e1n\u00e1 or police station in the north-east of Sylhet District, Assam; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 8' 7\" N., and long. 92\u00b0 10' 2\" E., on the old bed of the Hari river, at the foot of the Jaintia Hills. The weekly market is frequented by Kh\u00e1si and Santeng traders, who bring down the produce of their hills to exchange for cotton goods, salt, and rice. The village was formerly the capital of the R\u00e1ja of Jaintia, whose territory was annexed in 1835 in consequence of his being found guilty of complicity in the rite of human\nsacrifice. *(Vide Jauntia, ante, p. 47.)* The place contains some interesting architectural remains, marking the transition from the primitive paganism originally practised by the hill tribes to the elaborate Hinduism imported from Bengal\u2014the former symbolized by great monoliths of unhewn stone, now surrounded by Hindu temples and edifices with elaborate carvings and images.\n\n**Jaipur (Jeypore).**\u2014Native State in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, Central India, under the political superintendence of the Eastern States Agency of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Jaipur State is bounded on the north by Bikaner (Bickaneer), Loh\u00e1ru Jhajjar, and Pati\u00e1la; on the east by Alwar (Ulwur), Bhartpur (Bhurtapore), and Karauli; on the south by Gwalior, Bund\u00ed (Boondee), Tonk, and Mew\u00e1r or Udaipur (Oodeypore); on the west by Kishangarh, Jodhpur, and Bikaner. The State lies between lat. $25^\\circ 43'$ and $28^\\circ 27'$ N., and between long. $74^\\circ 50'$ and $77^\\circ 15'$ E. Area, 14,465 square miles. Population (1881) 2,534,357.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The general character of the country is tolerably level and open, although its surface is crossed and diversified by groups and ranges of hills and by isolated peaks. The centre of the State is an elevated table-land of triangular form, from 1400 to 1600 feet above sea-level, with a gradual slope to the south-east towards the Ban\u00e1s river. The eastern limit of the State is formed by ranges running north and south along the Alwar border, and at places cut up by numerous deep ravines; towards the north and west it is bounded by a broken chain of hills, an offshoot from the Aravalli mountains, which occupy the apex of the triangle. The hills here rise to a considerable height, with a bold outline; and on the north-west form a natural boundary between the sandy, desert tract of Shaikh\u00e1wati (or the country of the Shaikh\u00e1wat clan in the extreme north of the State) and Bikaner. To the south-east lies the more fertile soil of Jaipur proper. On the east, beyond the range of hills near the capital, there is a rapid fall of some 300 or 400 feet in the first 2 or 3 miles, after which a gradual slope follows the valley of the Bangang\u00e1 river to the Bhartpur border, and the country becomes more open as it spreads out towards the alluvial flats of the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1). In the extreme south of the State, the hills reappear; and in the neighbourhood of R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l, where the Ban\u00e1s river has forced itself through the range, the scenery is remarkable for its beauty. Westward from Jaipur city, the country rises gradually towards the Kishangarh border, consisting in great measure of broad, open, treeless plains, dotted here and there with hills.\n\nThe general drainage of Jaipur from the central table-land is to the east and south-east, though a few streams follow the slope to the north-west. The Ban\u00e1s, the largest river in the State, receives most of the rainfall by means of several tributaries, of which only one or two are\nperennial. The Banganga reaches the Jumna direct, flowing eastward through Jaipur territory. In the hot season, the surface bed of the Banganga is often dry. Of their tributaries in Jaipur, the Am\u00e1n-i-shah, which supplies Jaipur city with water, has a slight flow throughout the year; but other tributaries, such as the Gambhir, the Bandi, the Morel, the Dhund, the Mashti, and the Khari, although their beds are frequently of great width, are flooded only in the rains, and are dry during the hot months. The Sabi is the chief river that flows in a northerly direction. It rises about 24 miles due north of Jaipur city, and, after skirting Alwar, passes out into the N\u00e1bha State. It is subject to heavy floods. The Kantli flows north-north-west for a distance of about 60 miles through Shaikhawati, and loses itself in the sand as it enters Bikanir territory, at Sankhu.\n\nSouth of the dividing range between Shaikhawati and Jaipur, water is found beneath the surface at a depth varying from a few feet (in low-lying land) to 30 or 40 feet; but in Shaikhawati, north of that range, water lies at a great depth, averaging from 80 to 100 feet. It is brackish in many parts where the soil is much impregnated with salt; but sweet water may be found throughout the east and south of the State. The only natural lake of any importance is the Sambhar salt lake.\n\nThe soil of the State in the immediate neighbourhood of Jaipur city, and to the west and north, is generally sandy. There are tracts of barren sand, frequently underlaid by clay and stiff soil mixed with kankar (calcareous conglomerate). Eastward along the Banganga valley, and southward from Jaipur city, the soil is mostly rich and fertile. The Shaikhawati tract on the north consists almost entirely of shifting sands.\n\nThere are no extensive forests in Jaipur; but the hills near the city and in the south of the State are more or less covered with the dha (Anogeissus latifolius) and other jungle trees, of little value except for fuel. The babul (Acacia arabica) and the nim (Azadirachta indica) may be considered as the commonest trees of the country.\n\nNo regular geological survey has yet been undertaken of the hill ranges in Jaipur State; but they are said to consist in the north chiefly of granite, and in the south and east of sandstones, mixed sometimes with white or black marble, and occasionally with mica. As they do not contain any fossil remains, they are believed to be primitive rocks belonging to the transitionary series. The hills for the most part rise abruptly from the plain; many are peaked, but others are flat at the top, with edges steeply scarped for some way down the side, thus forming natural fortifications. In the north of the State, where the Khetri Hills meet the Alwar range, a great geological disturbance has taken place, the granite of the Aravalli mountains bursting through and upheaving the sandstones of the Alwar chain, thus exposing alum shales.\nand rich veins of copper ore, cobalt, and nickel. Copper mines are worked to a small extent in the neighbourhood of Khetri; but owing to the want of proper appliances for keeping down the water, the richest veins, which are lowest, cannot be reached. Cobalt is found in thin layers between the veins of copper ore. It is much used at Jaipur city for enamelling, and is exported for that purpose to Delhi and Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) in the Deccan. In addition to these minerals, salt is largely manufactured at, and exported from, the Sambhar Lake, situated in lat. 26\u00b0 58' N., and long. 75\u00b0 5' E., on the borders of Jodhpur. The average yearly out-turn of salt is 150,000 tons. Good building stone, chiefly sandstone and marble, is plentiful.\n\nAt B\u00e1nkri, 36 miles east of Jaipur city, and near the Dos\u00e1 (Dausa) railway station, huge slabs (some of them 30 feet long) of a foliated mica schist, valuable for roofing, are quarried. Coarse grey marble comes from Raiw\u00e1la, near the Alwar border, and a black marble, used for inlaying work, is obtained at Kot Putli. Abundance of excellent limestone is procured from Rah\u00e1on, 7 miles north of the K\u00e1nauta railway station, and kankar is found almost everywhere, generally in flat beds instead of nodules. Carbuncles are procured in large quantities in the south of the State, near R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l; and it is said that turquoises were formerly found in the same neighbourhood, near Todah.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014In Shaikh\u00e1wati, there is generally but one crop in the year\u2014raised during the rainy season, and ripening in October\u2013November. The crop consists chiefly of bajra (Holcus spicatus), m\u00fag (Phaseolus mungo), and moth (Phaseolus aconitifolius). In the north of Jaipur proper, the crop of the rainy season is the same as in Shaikh\u00e1wati, but a little wheat and barley are grown in the cold season. Towards the south and east, as the soil becomes richer and firmer, jo\u00e1r (Holcus sorghum) and Indian corn, with cotton and til (Sesamum), are grown in the rainy season; while in the cold season, wheat, barley, gram, sugar-cane, opium, tobacco, d\u00e1l, and linseed are extensively raised. In the eastern districts, rice of a coarse quality is cultivated to a limited extent. Few traces of former irrigation works exist; but since 1868, the State has spent at least \u00a35000 annually in improving the irrigation of the country. In 1882\u201383, the State expended on irrigation works a sum of \u00a323,862; the income from irrigation works was \u00a314,025 in the same year.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The first regular Census in the State of Jaipur was taken in February 1881, and disclosed a population of 2,534,357 persons, of whom 1,369,134 were returned as males, and 1,165,223 as females. The late M\u00e1har\u00e1j\u00e1 doubted the success of a Census in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, as a previous similar undertaking by him in his own territory had failed, owing to strong R\u00e1jput conservatism and disinclina-\ntion to make public declaration of family surroundings. The total population of 2,534,357 was returned as dwelling in 34 towns and 5930 villages, and occupying 507,697 houses. Number of persons per square mile, 175; number of houses per square mile, 35; number of persons per house, 5. Of the total population, 2,315,219 were returned as Hindus; 170,907 as Muhammadans; 552 as Christians; 47,672 as Jains; and 7 as P\u00e1rs\u00eds. Of the Hindus, 351,004 were Br\u00e1hmans and 124,345 R\u00e1jputs; other Hindu castes numbered 1,887,542, including 242,474 M\u00e1hajans or Baniy\u00e1s; 6641 Kachis; 171,632 G\u00fajars; 227,321 J\u00e1ts; 54,665 Ah\u00edrs; 221,565 Min\u00e1s; 209,094 Cham\u00e1rs; and 706,478 of other inferior castes. Of the Muhammadans, the sect of Shaikhs numbered 50,690; Sayyids, 7798; Mughals, 27,216; Path\u00e1ns, 3780; 'others,' 81,423. Of the Hindu independent sects in the State who have a peculiar doctrine and worship, the most notable is the D\u00e1du Panthi, which had its origin, and still has its head-quarters, at Bar\u00e1h\u00e1na, near the Sambhar lake. At the lake is a shrine and monastery built near the spot where the founder of the faith, D\u00e1du, vanished. D\u00e1du lived in the time of Akbar (16th century). His devotees shave the head and preach mysticism and morality as interpreted by his successors, the priests, at the shrine; they traverse the land on regular circuit to spread the word, and commune with disciples. The militant devotees belonging to this sect are known as N\u00e1gas, and are enrolled in regiments to serve the State; they are vowed to celibacy and to arms, and constitute a sort of military order in the sect.\u2014See Naraina.\n\nCommerce, etc.\u2014The most noticeable feature in the commerce of the State is the large banking and exchange business carried on at the capital and in the large towns. The chief manufactures of Jaipur are\u2014marble sculpture; enamel work on gold, for which the artisans are justly famous; woollen cloth, and other fabrics. An extensive dyeing trade is carried on at Sanganer, near the capital. The principal trade route of the State is the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 State Railway, by which the S\u00e1mbhar salt is carried to the North-Western Provinces and the Punjab, and by which also nearly the whole of the imports, such as English piece-goods, hardware, spices, grain, and Rohilkhand sugar are conveyed. The price of salt in 1882 was two shillings (1 rupee) for 30 pounds. There is but little traffic northward from the capital, as the trade of Shaikh\u00e1wati travels principally either north-east to the great mart of Bh\u00e1wani in Hiss\u00e1r or south-west to Ajm\u00edr. The principal export from Shaikh\u00e1wati is wool; the imports are sugar, piece-goods, hardware, spices, and tobacco. Owing to the sandy nature of the soil, camels are used almost entirely in the Shaikh\u00e1wati trade. The Mand\u00e1w\u00e1r and Karauli road is an important trade route for all the cotton, grain, oil-seeds, raw sugar, tobacco, etc. grown\nin the south and east of the State, where Hindaun is the principal mart. Copper and brass vessels are largely manufactured at the town of Siwai M\u00e1dhupur, and exported southwards via Indargarh into the Har\u00e1oti States. Other important roads passing through the State are the Agra and Ajm\u00edr road, and the Jaipur and Tonk road. The Agra-Ajm\u00edr road is much less used since the opening of the railway to Ajm\u00edr. A black marble is obtained at Baisl\u00e1n\u00e1; cobalt and sulphate of copper in the hills near Khetri. The amount of customs revenue to the State was \u00a373,109 in 1882.\n\nThere is a mint at the capital which turns out gold mohurs, rupees, and copper coins. The Jaipur coinage is distinguished by the jhar or sprig borne on the obverse. The gold mohur weighs 167\u00b78 grains, the metal being absolutely pure. The rupee, which is alloyed with 4\u00bd grains troy of copper, weighs 175 grains.\n\nCommunications. \u2014 The R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 State Railway on the metre (narrow) gauge runs from Agra to Jaipur city, and thence to Ajm\u00edr, with a branch line to Nas\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d (Nusseer\u00e1b\u00e1d). The line runs for 150 miles through Jaipur territory. It eventually joins the broad gauge line from Bombay at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d in Gujar\u00e1t. A line from Delhi, also on the metre gauge, and a part of the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 State Railway system, joins at Bandikui station in Jaipur territory. Short branches connect the towns on the S\u00e1mbhar Salt Lake with this system. The whole number of railway stations in the State was 22 in 1881. The Agra and Ajm\u00edr road is 127 miles long, metalled almost throughout. Its general direction is from east to west across the Jaipur territory, and the railway carries most of its ancient traffic. The Jaipur and Tonk road, 68 miles, is now completed. This road passes the towns of Sanganer, Ch\u00e1ts\u00fa, and Newai. A third main road leads from Mand\u00e1w\u00e1r on the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 State Railway to the borders of the Karauli territory, 49 miles distant. A heliograph communication with Fatehgarh in Shaikh\u00e1wati is maintained by certain opium merchants to record the rise or fall in the price of the drug from day to day. There are 22 post-offices in the State.\n\nEducation has made greater progress in Jaipur than in any other of the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na States. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s college at Jaipur city had a daily attendance, in 1882, of 628 students, who receive a good education in English, Sanskrit, and the vernacular languages, and are prepared for the matriculation and Arts Examination of the Calcutta University. There is also a school for the sons of Th\u00e1kurs and high officials, with a daily attendance, in 1882, of 15, a Sanskrit college (daily attendance 100), and an industrial school (daily attendance 97). There are 12 girls\u2019 schools in the State; pupils (1882), 547. In the country districts there are 45 elementary schools, wholly supported and periodically inspected by the State, with 1065 pupils in 1882;\nand 410 indigenous schools, with an aggregate attendance of 8220 pupils. Instruction is given both in Hindi and Urdu. The average annual cost of educating a young chief at the 'Nobles' School' is \u00a330. In 1882, \u00a3615 was spent on female education.\n\nBesides the capital, Jaipur, the principal towns in the State are:\u2014Chaken, population (1881) 6219; Amer, 5036; L\u00e1sot, 8743; Dosa, 7384; B\u00e1swa, 5791; Gijgarh, 5171; Hindaun, 12,761; Toda Bhim, 7142; Bamniaw\u00e1s, 6125; Gang\u00e1pur, 5880; M\u00e1dhapur, 14,075; S\u00edkar, 17,739; Malpura, 8212; S\u00e1mbhar, 10,794; Sri-M\u00e1dhapur, 6847; Fatehpur, 14,731; R\u00e1mgarh, 11,313; Nawalgarh, 10,032; Jhunjhnu, 9538; Udaipur, 9161; Lachhmangarh, 8713; Bissau, 6546; Chir\u00e1wa, 5489; Singh\u00e1na, 5259; Surajgarh, 5250; Patan, 11,886; Kot-Putli, 8084; Khandela, 7949; Jilo (Patan), 5941; Bairath, 5649; Mandra, 5567; Toda, 5546; and Khetri, 5283, all of which see separately.\n\nHistory.\u2014The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jaipur is the chief of the Kachhw\u00e1ha tribe of R\u00e1jputs, and claims descent from R\u00e1ma, King of Ajodhya (Oudh). Between the mythical R\u00e1ma and Dhola R\u00e1o, who founded the Jaipur State in A.D. 967, thirty-four generations are said to have intervened. At the time of the foundation of Jaipur, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na was divided among petty R\u00e1jput and M\u00edna chiefs, owing allegiance to the great Tu\u00e1r dynasty of R\u00e1jputs, who then reigned at Delhi. Dhola R\u00e1o and his Kachhw\u00e1has are said to have absorbed or driven out the petty chiefs, and to have founded a substantial dominion, known as Amber, Jaipur, or Dh\u00fandar. Half a century later, the Kachhw\u00e1ha chief, Hamaj\u00ed, wrested Amber from the M\u00ednas, and Amber remained the capital until 1728, when the second Jai Singh abandoned it for Jaipur. The ninth chief in succession from Hamaji was Udikaran, the grand-father of Shaikh, who conquered for himself the District now held by the Shaikh\u00e1wati sept of the Kachhw\u00e1ha clan.\n\nOn the irruption of the Mughals into Hindust\u00e1n, Jaipur State at once succumbed to their supremacy, and the Jaipur house furnished some of their most distinguished military leaders. At this period, Bah\u00e1rma, one of the twelve sons of Prithwi R\u00e1j\u00e1, was ruler in Jaipur, and to him among R\u00e1jputs is attached the discredit of having been the first prince of the dynasty who paid homage to the Muhammadan power. Bah\u00e1rma's son, Bhagw\u00e1n D\u00e1s, became still more nearly allied to the Mughals; for he is noted as one of the first instances of a prince who 'sullied R\u00e1jput purity by matri-monial alliance with the Islamite,' by giving his daughter in marriage to Prince Salim, who afterwards mounted the throne of Delhi as Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. The adopted son of Bhagw\u00e1n D\u00e1s, M\u00e1n Singh, was one of the most conspicuous of the imperial generals. M\u00e1n Singh fought in Orissa, Bengal, and Assam; and at a critical period, under great difficulties, he maintained his authority as Governor of K\u00e1b\u00fal.\nHe was rewarded with the governments of Bengal, Beh\u00e1r, and the Deccan. The next chief of note is Jai Singh, the nephew of M\u00e1n Singh, commonly known by his imperial title of M\u00edrz\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1. His name appears in all the wars of Aurangzeb in the Deccan. It was Jai Singh who contrived to capture Sivaji, the celebrated founder of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power. Eventually, it is said, Aurangzeb, becoming jealous of Jai Singh, caused his death by poison.\n\nPassing over three chiefs, we come to Jai Singh II., commonly known as Siw\u00e1i Jai Singh. Siw\u00e1i is a title given by the Mughal Emperor, and adopted by his descendants to this day. The word means one-and-a-quarter, and is supposed to measure the superiority of the bearer to all his contemporaries, whom the unit signifies. Jai Singh II., who ascended the throne in 1699, was chiefly remarkable for his scientific knowledge and skill. He caused many mathematical works to be translated into Sanskrit. He constructed observatories at Jaipur, Delhi, Benares, Muttra, and Ujjain, by which he was able to correct the astronomical tables of De La Hire, and to leave, as a monument of his skill, lists of stars collated by himself, known as the \u2018Tij Muhammad Sh\u00e1hi,\u2019 or Tables of Muhammad Shah, the then Emperor of Delhi, in whose favour Jai Singh stood high. Removing his capital from the hills about Amber, where it had hitherto been placed, he laid out and built the present Jaipur (Jeypore) in 1728. The ancient capital Amber, and the modern capital Jaipur, are about five miles distant from each other.\n\nAt a later period, the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Jaipur united with Udaipur (Mew\u00e1r) and Jodhpur (M\u00e1rw\u00e1r) to resist the Muhammadan power. To regain the honour of intermarriage with Udaipur, which his family had lost by giving a princess to the Mughal Emperor, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jaipur now consented that the issue of an Udaipur princess should succeed in preference to an elder son by other wives. This attempt to set aside the right of primogeniture brought great disasters both on Jaipur and Jodhpur. About this time the J\u00e1ts of Bhartpur (Bhurtpore), after several successful encounters with the Jaipur chief, annexed a portion of this State. The defection of the chief of Alwar, about the year 1790, further reduced the limits of the territory.\n\nBy the end of the century, Jaipur had fallen into great confusion, being distracted by internal broils, and impoverished by the exactions of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who had also entered the State. In 1803, political relations were first entered into with the British Government, the object being to form a league against the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s; but the alliance was dissolved by Lord Cornwallis. Meanwhile, the disputes between the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Jaipur and Jodhpur for the hand of the daughter of the Udaipur chief had brought both States to the verge of ruin, and Am\u00edr Kh\u00e1n, with his Pind\u00e1r\u00ed mercenaries and marauders, was exhausting\nthe country. In 1817, negotiations began again; and in 1818, a treaty was signed, by which the protection of the British Government was extended to Jaipur, and an annual tribute fixed.\n\nTwo successive minorities which followed the death of Jagat Singh in 1818, gave opportunities for strife about the succession, and for much misgovernment. In 1835, on the succession of the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, Siw\u00e1i R\u00e1m Singh, then two years old, as the result of a court intrigue, a serious disturbance in the city took place, in which Colonel Alves, the agent of the Governor-General in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, was wounded, and his assistant, Mr. Martin Blake, murdered. After this, the British Government took measures to insist upon order, to reform the administration as well as to support its effective action; and the State has gradually become well governed and prosperous. When the Mutiny broke out in 1857, the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 at once placed the whole of his available military power at the disposal of the Political Agent, and in every way assisted the British Government. He was rewarded with the grant of the pargan\u00e1 of Kot K\u00e1sim. He also received a sanad granting the privilege of adoption. For his praiseworthy behaviour and liberality during the famine in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na in 1868, he received an addition of 2 guns to his salute for life; and in 1877, this was again raised, making his personal salute 21 guns. For his general services and loyalty, he was created a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India, and nominated Counsellor of the Empress. Siw\u00e1i R\u00e1m Singh died on the 18th September 1880, leaving no direct heir, and was succeeded by Kaim Singh (the younger brother of the Th\u00e1kur of Isarda, and a descendant of the second son of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Jagat Singh), whom the chief had adopted on his death-bed. Kaim Singh, who on accession assumed the name of Siw\u00e1i M\u00e1dho Singh, was born in 1861. In consideration of his youth, the administration of the State was conducted for two years by a council under the joint-presidency of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 and the Resident. On attaining his majority in September 1882, the chief, Kaim Singh, was invested with full governing powers.\n\nThe right of succession, in the event of failure of direct heirs, is supposed to be vested in the R\u00e1j\u00e1wat family or the descendants of the stock of Prithwi R\u00e1j\u00e1, one of the former rulers. Prithwi R\u00e1j\u00e1 had twelve sons, to whom he gave estates known as the twelve Kotr\u00eds. The number of Kotr\u00eds, however, is now more than twelve, others having been obtained by descendants of early rulers, while some of the Kotr\u00eds created by Prithwi Raj\u00e1 are extinct. About 70 lakhs of rupees (\u00a3700,000) from the revenues of the State are alienated in j\u00e1girs and religious grants, but the available receipts are about \u00a3500,000 per annum, which is nearly balanced by the expenditure. In 1882-83, the\nrevenue was \u00a3495,876; and the expenditure, \u00a3488,599, including tribute of \u00a340,000 to the British Government.\n\nThe military force of the State consists of 65 guns (mostly of small calibre), 716 artillerymen, 3578 cavalry (including j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r feudal horse), and 9599 infantry (5000 of which belong to special bodies). The number of forts is 29, with an aggregate of 216 guns of all calibres. Both the troops and the ordnance are of indifferent value, but sufficient for maintaining the tranquillity of the country.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, in common with nearly all the chiefs of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, exercises supreme civil and criminal authority within his territories, and has the power of life and death in respect of his own subjects. The administration is carried on by a council composed of eight members, presided over by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, assisted by a secretary who acts as an ex officio member. Four departments\u2014judicial, revenue, military, and external\u2014are under the charge of three members of council, one of whom is a noble of Jaipur, another a native of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, and the third an official from another part of India. The principal feudatories of the State are Khetri, S\u00edkar, Un\u00ed\u00e1ra, Patan, B\u00e1swa, Nawalgarh, Mand\u00e1war, and Surajgarh, with the th\u00e1kurs of the twelve Kotr\u00ed\u00eds mentioned above. In 1884, all transit duties, excepting the duty on opium and intoxicating drugs, were abolished by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate is dry and healthy, and malarious fevers are of rare occurrence. In the cold season, the temperature is very agreeable; but in Shaikh\u00e1wati it is often unpleasantly cold, and hoarfrost frequently remains in the shade till long after sunrise. During the hot season, the winds from the west blow with great force in Shaikh\u00e1wati and the northern portions of Jaipur; but the sand soon parts with its heat, so that the nights are generally pleasant, and the mornings cool. Towards the south and east, the hot winds are less strong; but owing to the soil not being sandy, the nights and mornings are not so cool. The average annual temperature of Jaipur city, taken from a record of five years, is $81^\\circ27$ F.; the maximum temperature of 1875 was $106^\\circ$, and the minimum $38^\\circ$. In 1881, the maximum was $114^\\circ$, and the minimum $36^\\circ8$. May and June are generally the hottest months; January and February the coldest. There is usually a fair rainfall throughout the State, except in Shaikh\u00e1wati. Jaipur proper is seldom afflicted with the periodical famines which visit the neighbouring territories, for, being on the verge of the south-east and south-west monsoons, it receives rain from both. Cholera at times makes its appearance, but medical science is generally at hand to check its spread. In 1881, the attendance at the dispensaries scattered through the State, exclusive of the attendance (8833 out-patients, 568 in-patients) at the Mayo Hospital in Jaipur city, was 55,785 out-\npatients and 639 in-patients. In the following year (1882), the total patients treated had increased to 72,269 in number. The number of dispensaries was 22 in 1882. Sanitation is obtaining steadily increasing recognition from the State Darb\u00e1r. Vaccination is freely resorted to. In 1881, 19,088 persons were inoculated, and 30,996 in 1882-83. The medical institutions of the State are under the control of the Residency Surgeon. The rainfall at the capital during the fifteen years ending 1881 amounted to a yearly average of 24 inches; the maximum being 42'5 inches in 1870, the minimum 12'6 inches in 1868. In 1881, the rainfall was 22'81 inches.\n\nJaipur (Jeypore).\u2014Capital of the Native State of Jaipur (Jeypore), R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, Central India. Jaipur is situated in lat. 26\u00b0 55' N., and long. 75\u00b0 52' E., on the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 State Railway and the Agra and Ajm\u00edr trunk road; 149 miles north-east of Ajm\u00edr. Population (1881) 142,578.\n\nJaipur is the largest town and the chief commercial centre of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. It is in many respects the finest of modern Hindu cities, and is said to be the only city in India built on a regular plan. The city takes its name Jainagar or Jaipur from the famous Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Siw\u00e1i Jai Singh II. It was founded by Jai Singh II. in 1728, and stands in a small plain, conjectured to be the bed of a dried-up lake. Jaipur is surrounded on all sides, except the south, by rugged hills, the summits of which are now, at all important points, crowned with forts. At the end of the ridge, overhanging the city on the north-west, is the chief defensive work, the Nahargarh, or \u2018Tiger Fort,\u2019 the rock face of which is so scarped as to be inaccessible on the south or city side; while on the north, the ridge slopes towards Amber, the ancient capital of the State. A masonry crenelated wall, averaging in height 20 feet, and in thickness 9 feet, encloses the whole city. In the wall are 7 gateways, furnished with screen walls, all built of the same pattern, with 2 kiosks above and machicoulis over the entrance. At intervals are bastions and towers pierced for cannon, while the parapet is loopholed for musketry. The city is remarkable for the regularity and width of its streets. Some of the mosques, temples, and private residences have architectural pretensions. But in many cases the beautiful marble or carved red sandstone of true Hindu architecture has given place to imitations in stucco; and the lofty crenelated walls which line the streets often form a sham fa\u00e7ade to mean one-storied tenements. The town has an air of unreality, and an appearance of being rapidly made to order; but Amber, the ancient deserted city overhanging the mountain lake, five miles to the north-east, is as interesting from its genuine architecture as from its picturesque situation and eventful history. Its solid and patient work forms a striking contrast to the plaster-of-Paris ornamentation of the modern\nJaipur. Most of the buildings are of a pink colour. From east to west, Jaipur is a little over 2 miles in length, and in breadth about 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) mile. It is laid out in rectangular blocks, and divided by cross streets into six equal portions, which are in turn intersected at regular intervals by narrower paths, the sub-division proceeding until at last the thoroughfares become mere lanes. The main streets, paved, drained, and lighted by gas manufactured outside the city walls, are 111 feet in width, the secondary ones 55 feet, and the smaller 27\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet. The houses of the nobility and the citizens are in the suburbs. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s palace with its pleasure-grounds occupies the centre of the town, covering about one-seventh of the town area.\n\nJaipur is a wealthy city. There are as many as 7 banking firms, whose aggregate business amounts to about 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) crores of rupees (\u00a32,500,000), and who possess a capital of upwards of \u00a36,000,000 sterling. In addition to these firms, there are several minor houses whose collective business may be estimated at half a crore (\u00a3500,000) a year. Exchange and banking constitute the greater portion of the trade of the place. The city is well provided with hospitals, dispensaries, almshouses, and schools. There is a School of Arts (with 97 pupils) and an Industrial and Economic Museum, started in 1880. The Mayo Hospital, which is situated in the R\u00e1m New\u00e1s Gardens, forms one of the principal architectural features of the city; while the R\u00e1m New\u00e1s Gardens themselves, 70 acres in extent, are among the finest and best laid out in India. The gardens are kept up at a yearly cost of \u00a33000. An Exhibition, which was well attended, was held in Jaipur in 1882. The Jaipur College has been noticed in the account of the State. The mint and the jail are situated in the city. The imperial post-office, the telegraph office, and the Residency for the political officer accredited to the Jaipur court, are outside the city walls, where there are also a staging bungalow and a hotel. A menagerie containing a number of tigers is maintained by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1. A large lake called the Manta tank is stocked with crocodiles. Good drinking water is brought into the city from the Aman-i-Sh\u00e1h river, about 4 miles distant. The water is raised by steam pumps 104 feet into service reservoirs, which command the city, and through which it is delivered in iron pipes under 50 feet pressure.\n\nA regular Census of the city of Jaipur was taken in 1870, by which its population was ascertained to number 137,847 persons; the Census of 1881 returned a population of 142,578, among whom Hindus numbered 100,850; Muhammadans, 32,951; \u2018others,\u2019 unspecified, 8777. One of the most interesting antiquities of the State is the Hindu observatory (Jantra) at the capital. The observatory was erected early in the last century by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Siw\u00e1i Jai Singh II., the celebrated astronomer and mathematician, and is the largest of five he constructed\nin different cities of the Mughal Empire. The ancient observatory at Jaipur contains dials, azimuth circles, altitude pillars, etc. of huge size, and for the most part built of masonry covered with lime, upon which the graduations were carefully marked. The instruments have suffered much from age and exposure, and have not been used within the present generation. A meteorological observatory is in working order. The average rainfall for fifteen years ending 1881, was 24 inches. Highest maximum temperature in the same year, $117^\\circ$ F.; lowest minimum, $36^\\circ$.\n\nOn the summit of a range of hills, a mile and a half east of Jaipur, is a sacred shrine called the Gulta, with a temple dedicated to Surya or the Sun-god. Below the platform, a spring issues, which pours over the rock by a fall of about 70 feet into the valley below. The water of this spring is considered sacred by the Br\u00e1hmans. The ancient city of Amber is perched among the hills between four and five miles to the north-east of Jaipur. The ruins of Amber preserve traces of former splendour, but their solitude and desolation are complete.\n\n**Jaipur.**\u2014Town in Lakhimpur District, Assam; situated in lat. $27^\\circ 15'$ N., and long. $95^\\circ 26'$ E., on the left bank of the Dihing river, on the frontier of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills. In the neighbourhood are extensive coal-fields, with an estimated marketable out-turn of 10 million tons. The river is navigable up to this point by steamers during the rains, and 50 miles higher by boats. The exports are tea, caoutchouc, beeswax, and ivory, valued at \u00a31600; the imports are rice, salt, tobacco, oil, iron, and cloth, valued at \u00a32000. A small guard of Frontier Police is stationed here, occupying the old military cantonment.\n\n**Jaipur (Jayapuram).**\u2014Zamind\u00e1ri or tributary estate in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency; lying between $17^\\circ 30'$ and $20^\\circ$ N. lat., and $81^\\circ 20'$ and $84^\\circ 4'$ E. long. Bounded on the north by K\u00e1l\u00e1handi in the Central Provinces; on the east by the plain of Vizagapatam; on the south by Rekapalli and Golconda; on the west by Bast\u00e1r. Area, 9337 square miles. Population (1872) 452,454; (1881) 611,695; houses, 134,111; annual tribute to Government, \u00a31600. The estate comprises the following t\u00e1luks:\u2014Kor\u00e1pat (population, 157,171; houses, 33,824); Na\u00f3rangpur (population, 93,502; houses, 20,666); Malkangiri (population, 22,558; houses, 5425); Jaipur (Kotip\u00e1d) (population, 116,117; houses, 24,017); Gun\u00e1pur (population, 153,822; houses, 34,380); and R\u00e1y\u00e1gada (population, 68,525; houses, 15,799).\n\nJaipur zamind\u00e1ri may be divided into two parts. The larger part, directly under the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and within the jurisdiction of the Assistant Agent, lies on the so-called Jaipur plateau; the other part, consisting of the t\u00e1luks of G\u00fanapur and R\u00e1y\u00e1gada, is administered by the Senior Assistant Collector, whose head-quarters are at P\u00e1rvat\u00edpur. 'To\nthe east and north-east of G\u00fanapur lies the Saur\u00e1 Hill country, consisting of two table-lands, about 200 square miles in extent. North of G\u00fanapur, the estate runs up in a wedge-like form to a distance of 70 miles, between K\u00e1l\u00e1handi of the Central Provinces on the west, and Chinna Kimedi on the east, reaching very nearly to 20\u00b0 N. lat. In the centre of this tract stands out the remarkable group of hills named N\u00edmgiris, which rise to a height of 5000 feet, separated by valleys of not more than 1200 feet from the ranges on either hand. The drainage from the N\u00edmgiris and the neighbouring country flows directly south-east to the sea, forming at Kalingapatam the river Vams\u00e1dh\u00e1ra, so called from the bamboos (vamsa) growing on its banks, and the N\u00e1g\u00e1vali at Chicacole. Exclusive of large estates held by semi-independent Kandhs, the upper portion of Jaipur zamind\u00e1ri is occupied by three powerful chiefs, one at Godairi, one at Bissemkatak, and the third at Singapur, feudatories of the State\u2019 (Carmichael). The population subject to these chiefs (chiefly Kandhs and Saur\u00e1s) numbers 137,966, the largest villages being G\u00fanapur, R\u00e1y\u00e1gada, Sing\u00e1pur, Bissemkatak. The western portion of the country consists of the t\u00e1luks of Jaipur, N\u00e1orangpur, and Malkangiri; while the t\u00e1luk of Kor\u00e1pat lies in the east. The principal towns are Jaipur (1046 houses and 4321 inhabitants), Kotip\u00e1d (605 houses, 3096 inhabitants), N\u00e1orangpur (554 houses, 2843 inhabitants).\n\nThe religion of the country is Hindu. Ethnically, the inhabitants include Aryans, Kolarians, and Dravidians. The Aryans are comparatively recent colonists, and comprise the ruling and fighting men and the priests. The cultivators, called prajas (literally \u2018subjects\u2019), number more than two-thirds of the entire population; Aryans represent one-seventeenth; Pariahs, one-sixth. The mountaineers retain far greater independence than the r\u00fayats of the Jaipur and Malkangiri plateaux. In the uplands, patriarchal authority is still unassailable; in the lower-lying tracts it is only preserved in parts where the struggle is still carried on between cultivation and jungle.\n\nEvery variety of land tenure is found throughout Jaipur. One variety is that in which the ownership of the soil still rests with the people, in contradistinction to the landlord tenure generally held by the zamind\u00e1rs. Only of late years has the annual gift in token of homage been commuted to a payment in kind or money. In such cases, the landowner is nearly always the head of a village; and though it may be doubted whether he has any right to dispose of the soil for his private interest, he has for ages been in the habit of selling or mortgaging parts of the landed property of the village without reference to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 or his managers. From this patriarchal authority may be traced a regular gradation in the tenures, as they pass by degrees to the paramount authority of the R\u00e1j\u00e1.\nThe religious ceremonies and social customs of the various tribes differ but little from one another. The process of fusion of the habits of later immigrants with aboriginal customs is, however, very apparent. In those parts of the country which are in a prosperous condition, ideas and manners imported from the coast Districts are gradually overcoming and absorbing all aboriginal conceptions; but, on the other hand, in jungle-covered and backward lands, the colonists are always corrupted by the superstitions of the indigenous races. Thus in Kotip\u00e1d and Sing\u00e1pur, highly cultivated and flourishing tracts, the new-comers have taught the earlier races to burn their dead instead of burying them; and the practice of early marriage is spreading among the richer r\u00e1yats\u2014a custom altogether foreign to aboriginal notions. As an instance of the way in which religious rites are borrowed from the aborigines, the Meriah sacrifice may be quoted. This is believed to be strictly a Kandh rite; it was adopted by the colonists, for there is evidence that it was practised by the former R\u00e1j\u00e1s of this and the neighbouring hill States; and in 1845 the appointment of a Special Agent for the suppression of human sacrifice became necessary. This Agency was abolished in 1861. A familiar example of this aboriginal influence is the increased belief in witchcraft, characteristic of forests and lonely tracts.\n\nThe following is Mr. Carmichael's account of the zamind\u00e1ri tenure:\n\n\u2014'At the period of the cession of the Northern Circars, we found the country divided into haveli and zamind\u00e1ri. The haveli lands consisted of the old demesne or household lands of the Sovereign and tracts near to towns resumed by the Muhammadans, and appropriated for the support of their numerous garrisons and establishments. These lands the local Faujd\u00e1rs and Naw\u00e1bs always retained under their immediate management, parcelling out the rest of the country into zamind\u00e1ris. . . . But the Muhammadan rulers were impatient of details, and a mode was invented of transacting the business of revenue more in the gross. Its revenue agents, writes Mill, were rendered stationary in the Districts where they collected, and became responsible to Government for the revenue, receiving payment by a percentage or share of what they collected. Under native Governments, everything which was enjoyed, whether office or possession, had a tendency to become hereditary. There was a convenience in preserving in each District the same grand agent of revenue, and after him his son or successor, because each was better acquainted with the people and the resources of the District than, generally speaking, any other man could be. In this manner the situation of these agents became in fact hereditary; and before the period of the English acquisitions, the Persian appellative of zamind\u00e1r had been generally appropriated to them.'\nThe Jaipur zamind\u00e1ri and the family of its R\u00e1j\u00e1 are of old standing, and the origin of both is involved in a mist of tradition. The country was formerly held by a S\u00edla Vansa ruler, who reigned at Nand\u00e1pur, when the ancestors of the present house were retainers of the Gajapati rulers of Cuttack (Katak). \u2018About the 15th century, Vinayak Deo, the founder, a R\u00e1jput of the Lunar line (Chandra vansa), is said to have married a daughter of the Gajapati ruler, who bestowed this principality upon him, on the extinction of the old line of the Nand\u00e1pur chiefs. To secure his pretensions with the wild races of the highlands, the new feudatory took for his second wife the last surviving princess of the ancient stock of S\u00edla Vansa rulers. Whatever the origin of the S\u00edla Vansa dynasty, it is certain that an ancestor of the Jaipur family was in possession, not only of the country comprised in the limits of the Jaipur zamind\u00e1ri as it now stands, but of all the present hill zamind\u00e1ris which lie at the base of the gh\u00e1ts, when the founder of the Vizian\u00e1garam R\u00e1j came to Chicacole in the train of the Golconda Faujd\u00e1r, Sher Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, about the year 1652. The tribute payable by Jaipur to the Golconda commander was \u00a32400\u2019 (Carmichael).\n\nPrevious to the acquisition of the Northern Circars by the East India Company, Jaipur was subordinated to Vizian\u00e1garam; and this relation was upheld by the British till 1794, when the R\u00e1ja\u2019s loyalty after the battle of Padman\u00e1bhan was rewarded by a perpetual sanad. In 1803, his peshkash or tribute was fixed at \u00a31600. In addition to this, Jaipur pays \u00a3300 annually to Bast\u00e1r for the Kolip\u00e1d country. In 1848, the affairs of the estate fell into great confusion, owing to the insubordination of some members of the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s family. The disturbance went so far that the lower t\u00e1luks were attached by Government. The troubles lasted two years, and broke out again in 1855. In 1860, for the first time, the British interfered in the administration of justice in the zamind\u00e1ri; and since the accession of the present R\u00e1j\u00e1, the Assistant Agent has resided within Jaipur, and is aided by 6 sub-magistrates and a strong police force. There were two unimportant outbreaks of Saur\u00e1s in 1865\u201366. Mr. Carmichael\u2019s Manual of Vizagapatam contains a full and interesting account of the zamind\u00e1ri.\n\nJaipur (Jayapuram, \u2018The city of victory\u2019).\u2014Town in Jaipur zamind\u00e1ri, Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 18\u00b0 55' N., and long. 82\u00b0 38' E.; containing 1046 houses and (1881) 4321 inhabitants. Situated (at an elevation of 2000 feet above sea-level) 7 miles north of the northern wall of the plateau of the Vizagapatam Hills. Jaipur has neither trade nor manufacture, and is only of importance as the residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1. The Assistant Agent and Superintendent have moved to Kor\u00e1pat on account of the unhealthiness of Jaipur. There is still a sub-magistrate. The town consists of\na long straggling street lined with mud huts. The palace of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 and a large number of pagodas are the only buildings of note.\n\n**Jais (Jais Rokha, or Rokha Jais).**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Salon tahsil, R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli District, Oudh. Bounded on the north by Mohanganj pargan\u00e1; on the east by Amethi pargan\u00e1; on the south by Parsh\u00e1depur and Ateha pargan\u00e1s, the S\u00e1i river forming the boundary; and on the west by R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli pargan\u00e1. A level and generally very fertile tract, but with extensive saline plains (\u00fasar) in the east and north, with low-lying lands, subject to annual inundation. Around J\u00e1is town the soil is of exceptional richness, the poppy plant being extensively cultivated. Area, 154\u00bd square miles, or 98,882 acres, of which 84,443 acres are cultivated and 13,531 available for cultivation. About three-fourths of the cultivated area is irrigated. Government land revenue, \u00a39967, at an average rate of 2s. 4\u00bdd. per arable acre. Of the 110 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 54 are held under t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri, 22 under zamin\u00e1d\u00e1ri, and 54 under pattid\u00e1ri tenure. Kanhpuri\u00e1s own 76, and Musalm\u00e1ns 19 villages. Population (1872) 84,443; (1881) 86,084, namely, males 41,996, and females 44,088. Five lines of road intersect the pargan\u00e1, and a ferry is maintained across the S\u00e1i at Parsh\u00e1depur. Exports\u2014grain; imports\u2014principally cotton and salt from Cawnpur.\n\n**Jais.**\u2014Town in Salon tahsil, and head-quarters of Jais pargan\u00e1, R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli District, Oudh; situated on the Sult\u00e1npur and R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli road, 4 miles west of Nasir\u00e1b\u00e1d, and 16 south-west of Salon. Lat. 26\u00b0 15\u2032 55\u2033 N., long. 81\u00b0 35\u2032 55\u2033 E. Formerly called Udayanagar; and captured by the Muhammadans during the invasion of Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad, who gave the place its present name. Picturesquely situated on rising ground, among groves of mango trees. Population (1872) 11,317; (1881) 11,044, namely, Hindus, 5749; Muhammadans, 5281; \u2018others,\u2019 14. Area, 1581 acres. The town does not contain a single Hindu shrine. The Jains, however, have a temple dedicated to Parasn\u00e1th. Two large mosques, and a handsome im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, dating from 200 years ago. The roof, walls, and pillars of the latter are profusely ornamented with illuminated texts from the Kur\u00e1n. Garh\u00e1 cloth and muslin, manufactured by Muhammadan weavers, form the sole export. Salt-petre is also manufactured, but not to any considerable extent. Three considerable bi-weekly markets; Government Anglo-veracular school.\n\n**Jaisalmer (Jeysulmere).**\u2014Native State in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, under the political superintendence of the Western R\u00e1jput\u00e1na States Agency of Central India. The State lies between lat. 26\u00b0 5\u2032 and 28\u00b0 23\u2032 N., and between long. 62\u00b0 29\u2032 and 77\u00b0 15\u2032 E. Its greatest length from east to west is 172 miles, and greatest breadth from north to south, 136 miles. It is in shape an irregular oval, the longest axis being 215 miles, lying north-east and south-west. The area of the State is 16,447 square miles;\nand the population (1881) 108,143. It is bounded on the north by Bah\u00e1walpur; on the east by Bik\u00e1n\u00e9r (Bickaneer) and Jodhpur; on the south by Jodhpur and Sind; on the west by Khairpur and Sind.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Jaisalmer is almost entirely a sandy waste, forming part of what is called \u2018the Great Indian Desert.\u2019 In the neighbourhood of Jaisalmer city, within a circuit of about 40 miles, the soil is very stony, and sandstone rocks, flat-topped and destitute of vegetation, occur; but with this exception, the aspect of the country is that of an interminable sea of sandhills, of all shapes and sizes, some rising to a height of 150 feet. The sandhills in the western portion of the State are covered with phog (Calligonum) bushes; in the eastern, with tufts of long grass. Nothing can well bear a more desolate appearance. The villages are far apart, and consist, as a rule, of a few circular huts or wigwams collected round a well of brackish water. Shifting sands are common, locally termed draens. Towards Tarnot and the west of Jaisalmer, there is an attempt at cultivation. In the east, near the large villages of Noh, Bikampur, and Birsilpur, fields have been formed in the valleys between the sandhills, where, when the season is favourable, the inhabitants grow jo\u00e1r and bijra. Water is scarce, and generally brackish. The average depth of the wells is about 250 feet. A well recently measured by an officer of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, at Choria, 32 miles south-east of the capital, was 490 feet deep. Rain-water is used for drinking purposes as much as possible; but owing to a precarious rainfall, the supply stored up in the village ponds often fails. There are no perennial streams in Jaisalmer, and only one small river, called the Kakni. The Kakni rises near the villages of Kotri, Gohira, and Latab\u00e1na, and after flowing 28 miles, spreads over a large surface of flat ground, forming a lake called the Bhuj Jhil. When there is an exceptionally large rainfall, the Kakni deviates from its usual course near the village of K\u00e1lldh\u00e1na, and, passing Lodhoroa, empties itself on a Rann, or flat salt marsh, 15 or 16 miles beyond Bhuj, and there dries up. The river L\u00e1thi-ka-nad\u00ed formerly entered Jaisalmer from Jodhpur State. Its bed has contained no water since 1825.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate of Jaisalmer is dry and healthy. Epidemics are rare. Fever, spleen, skin disorders, guinea-worm, and small-pox are common diseases. The temperature is highest in May and June, when hot winds prevail with violence. As soon as rain falls, the weather becomes cool and pleasant. The coldest period is from the middle of December to the middle of February. The climate is liable to extremes of cold and heat, especially in the northern part of the State. No observations on the rainfall or temperature have been registered, but the rainfall is sometimes very slight; in 1875, for instance, there were only two rainy days. The country is, however, under the influence of\nthe south-west monsoon, and usually has a fair rainfall in June, July, and August.\n\n**History.**\u2014The majority of the inhabitants of Jaisalmer State are Yadu Bhati R\u00e1jputs, and claim a very ancient lineage. They take their name from an ancestor named Bhati, who was renowned as a warrior when the tribe were settled in the Punjab. Shortly after the settlement in the Punjab, the clan was driven southwards by the King of Ghazn\u00ed across the Sutlej (Satlej), and found a refuge in the Indian Desert, which has been henceforth their home. It is probable that, like the R\u00e1htor R\u00e1jputs, the clan is descended from one of the Indo-Scythic tribes, who penetrated into Hindust\u00e1n at a very remote period. The Bhatis, subsequent to their entry into the desert tract, engaged in constant struggles with the neighbouring tribes, whom they overcame. They established themselves successively at Tarnot, Deor\u00e1wal, and Jaisalmer. Deor\u00e1wal was founded by Deor\u00e1j, who is esteemed the real founder of the present ruling family. Deor\u00e1j was the first to take the title of R\u00e1wal. He is said to have been born in 836. In 1156, Jaisal, the sixth in succession from Deor\u00e1j, founded the fort and city of Jaisalmer, and made it his capital. Jaisal was succeeded by several warlike princes, who were constantly engaged in raids and battles. But the taste for freebooting proved disastrous. On two occasions, namely in 1294, and shortly afterwards, the Bhatis so enraged the Emperor Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, that the imperial army captured and sacked the fort and city of Jaisalmer, which for some time remained deserted. The reign of R\u00e1wal Sabal Singh marks an epoch in Bhati history, for this prince, by acknowledging the supremacy of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, was the first of his line to hold his dominions as a fief of the Delhi Empire.\n\nJaisalmer had now arrived at the height of its power; the territory extended north to the Sutlej, comprised the whole of Bah\u00e1walpur westward to the Indus, and to the east and south included many Districts subsequently annexed by the R\u00e1htors, and incorporated in Jodhpur and Bik\u00e1ner. But from this time till the accession of R\u00e1wal Mulr\u00e1j in 1762, the fortunes of the State rapidly declined, and most of the outlying Provinces were wrested from Jaisalmer. Owing, however, to its isolated situation, the State escaped the ravages of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. R\u00e1wal Mulr\u00e1j was the first chief of Jaisalmer with whom the British Government entered into political relations. In 1818, a treaty was concluded with Mulr\u00e1j, by which the succession was guaranteed to his posterity; the chief was to be protected from serious invasions and dangers to his State, provided he was not the originator of the quarrel; and he was to act in subordinate co-operation with the British Government. No tribute was demanded. Since the death of Mulr\u00e1j in 1820, there have been no stirring events in Jaisalmer. Mulr\u00e1j was succeeded by his grandson Gaj Singh, who died in 1846.\nGaj Singh's widow adopted Ranjit Singh, nephew of Gaj Singh. On the death of Ranjit Singh in 1864, his younger brother, the present chief, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1w\u00e1l Bairi S\u00e1l, who was born in 1848, came to the throne.\n\nThe ruler of Jaisalmer is styled Mah\u00e1r\u00e1w\u00e1l, and holds his position as head of the Bhatis. The constitution of the State may be described as a tribal suzerainty in process of conversion to the feudal stage. The Bhatis are divided into numerous clans, which do not all spring from one brotherhood, as is the case with the R\u00e1htors. Many of the tribal chiefs, although acknowledging the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1w\u00e1l as their suzerain, are to a great extent independent, and hold their estates revenue free. In some cases, the land is equally divided amongst all the sons; in others, the eldest son succeeds, and the younger brothers receive small portions as their inheritance. The Bhatis retain their Hindu usages, though with some degree of laxity, derived from their intercourse with Muhammadans on the northern and western frontiers. The Districts are governed by h\u00e1kims (magistrates), who have, however, but little real power on the estates of the Th\u00e1kurs or R\u00e1jput chiefs.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Throughout Jaisalmer State, only rain crops, such as b\u00e1fra, jo\u00e1r, moth, til, etc., are grown; spring crops of wheat, barley, etc. are rare. The system of cultivation is rude. When the rainy season commences, the sandhills are ploughed by camels, and the seed is planted deep in the ground. After the seed has sprouted, a few showers, at long intervals, bring it to maturity. As the light-built desert camels move quickly, each householder is able to put a large extent of ground under crop. Owing to scanty rainfall, irrigation is almost unknown. The land revenue is paid in kind. Wherever wheat or gram is grown, the State takes from the cultivators from a fourth to a sixth of the produce; and of the rain crops, from a seventh to an eleventh. There are three different modes of collecting the State share of the cut-turn. In the first mode, the crop is valued when standing; in the second, when cut, but before threshing; in the third, after it has been threshed out. In addition to the portion payable to the State, the cultivator has to settle the demands of the officials who look after the crops, and also of the grain storekeeper and the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1w\u00e1l's water supplier. These demands generally average half as much again as the State demand. J\u00e1gird\u00e1rs take from their tenants of the cultivating class 4s. rent for as much land as can be cultivated with one pair of bullocks; other tenants are permitted to till as much ground as they like rent free, on condition of military service. There are 461 villages in Jaisalmer, of which 229 are fiscal, 71 are held by j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs, 32 as charitable grants, 11 under title-deed, 109 in bh\u00fam (under this tenure the holder has to perform paid service\nfor the State when called upon), and 9 for services to the State. Certain villages are sanctuaries. If a criminal escape to a sanctuary village, he is out of the jurisdiction of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1w\u00e1l.\n\n**Population.**\u2014Previous to 1881 no Census of the Jaisalmer State had been taken, and for general purposes the population was estimated at 72,000 people. The Census of 1881 returned the following information:\u2014Total population, 108,143; area, 16,447 square miles; number of persons to the square mile, 6\u00b757. This scanty population is scattered through 413 villages and 1 town, Jaisalmer (10,965): total number of houses, 26,217; number of persons per house, 4\u00b712. The religious division of the people is as follows:\u2014Hindus, 57,484, or 53\u00b71 per cent.; Muhammadans, 28,032, or 25\u00b79 per cent.; Jains, 1671, or 1\u00b75 per cent.; \u2018others,\u2019 unspecified, 20,955; 1 person is returned as a Christian. As regards caste, the Hindus are thus divided\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 6055; R\u00e1jputs, 26,623; Mah\u00e1jans, 7981; J\u00e1ts, 403; other inferior castes, 16,422. Of the Muhammadans there are\u2014Shaikhs, 273; Pathans, 258; \u2018others\u2019 not specified, 27,501.\n\n**Trade, etc.**\u2014There are no manufactures of any kind, beyond the making of blankets of sheep\u2019s wool, and the cutting of platters and cups from stone found in the country. Large herds of camels, horned cattle, sheep, and goats are kept. The principal trade of Jaisalmer is in wool, gh\u00ed, camels, cattle, and sheep, all of which find a ready market in Gujar\u00e1t and Sind. Grain, sugar, foreign cloth, piece-goods, and other miscellaneous articles, form the chief imports. Neither the home manufactures nor the crops suffice for local wants.\n\n**Administration.**\u2014There is one civil court at Jaisalmer. Criminal cases are disposed of by the diw\u00e1n (chief minister) at the capital, and in the interior by the h\u00e1kims of the Districts. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1w\u00e1l alone has the power of life and death. There is no separate jail at Jaisalmer. Prisoners are confined in the fort, or in such places as the authorities choose. Education is at a low ebb in the State. Government schools are non-existent. Jain priests are the chief schoolmasters, but their teaching is very elementary. There are no made roads in the State. Camels are the chief means of locomotion.\n\nThe revenues of Jaisalmer, as compared with its area, are very small, amounting to about \u00a310,000. In 1873\u201374, the income of the State amounted to \u00a311,854; the expenditure to \u00a315,911. No later figures are available. This low income is to be accounted for partly by the poverty of the country, and partly by the fact that the greater portion of the land belongs to feudal chiefs, related to the ruling family.\n\nThe Mah\u00e1r\u00e1w\u00e1l has a force of 400 infantry, of whom many are mounted on camels, the animal ordinarily used for locomotion in these sandy tracts. The cavalry number about 500, including the\nFeudal and J\u00e1ghird\u00e1r Horse. Of the cavalry, about 40 are Sikhs, and the rest of the forces, both infantry and cavalry, are natives of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na or of the bordering Districts of Sind. The men are armed chiefly with the ordinary matchlock, sword, shield, or spear of the country, but have no drill or discipline. They constitute an efficient police. The total number of serviceable guns is 12, served by 20 gunners.\n\n**Jaisalmer (Jeysulmere).**\u2014Chief town and capital of the Native State of Jaisalmer, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, Central India. Jaisalmer is situated in a broad belt of low rocky ridges. Lat. 26\u00b0 55' N., long. 70\u00b0 57' E. The town stands about 800 feet above the level of the sea. It was founded in the year 1156 by R\u00e1wal Jaisal. The buildings are chiefly of yellow sandstone. At a short distance, the colour of the walls gives an appearance of mud; on closer inspection, the excellent quality of the stone attracts attention, not only for its durability, but for its fine grain, affording great scope to the architect. This has been thoroughly appreciated by the wealthy inhabitants, for in few places is found such exquisite carving in stone as that which decorates the houses of some of the opulent Osw\u00e1l and Palliw\u00e1l merchants in Jaisalmer. The fort caps a small hill, which overlooks the town. Its elevation is estimated at 250 feet, and its length at about 350 yards. The walls, which afford a double line of defence, are about 25 feet in height, and of great strength, being constructed with large blocks of the same sandstone as that of which the city is built. The plan of the fortification is peculiar. It is apparently a succession of towers or circular bastions, the connecting curtains being also curved. Huge round boulders lie in close array along the battlements, ready for offensive purposes in case of assault. The view from the ramparts is not attractive. The foreground presents a succession of sterile rock-bound ridges, barely clad with stunted bushes, whilst on the horizon low undulations mark the commencement of the Indian Desert. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1w\u00e1l's palace surmounts the main entrance of the fort. The interior is ill-arranged, and frittered away in numberless small apartments. Water is obtained from three good wells within the palace. The Jain temples in the fort are remarkable for their fine stone carving. The oldest temple was built in 1371. A large annual fair is held within 10 miles of the city.\n\n**Jaisinghnagar.**\u2014Village in S\u00e1g\u00e1r tahsil, S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) District, Central Provinces. Lat. 23\u00b0 38' N., and long. 78\u00b0 37' E.; 21 miles south-west of S\u00e1g\u00e1r town. Population (1881) 2742, namely, Hindus, 1766; Kab\u00edrpanth\u00eds, 449; Jains, 283; Muhammadans, 243; aboriginal, 1. Founded about 1690 by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jai Singh, the ruler of Old S\u00e1g\u00e1r, who built a fort, still remaining, to protect the country from the raids of petty chiefs. At the cession of S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) to the British in 1818, this tract was included; and in 1826 it was assigned as a residence for Rukm\u00e1 B\u00e1\u00ed, one of the widows of Ap\u00e1\nS\u00e1hib. Bi-weekly market, with trade in grain, cloth, and provisions; village school for boys. Police station; post-office.\n\n**Jaitak.**\u2014Hill fortress in Sirm\u00far (Sarmor) State, Punjab, crowning a steep ridge of slate, which rises above the Khi\u00e1rda D\u00fan. Lat. 30\u00b0 36' N., long. 77\u00b0 24' E. During the war in 1814, the G\u00farkhas occupied this position with a garrison of 2200 men. They were attacked by two British detachments, 1700 strong, but without success; and it was not until after a tedious series of operations that the fort was finally captured in the following year. Elevation above sea-level, 4854 feet.\n\n**Jait\u00e1pur.**\u2014Sea-port in the R\u00e1j\u00e1pur Sub-division of Ratn\u00e1giri District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 16\u00b0 37' 30\" N., and long. 73\u00b0 24' 30\" E.; average annual value of trade for five years ending 1881\u201382, \u00a3210,575, namely, exports, \u00a3110,905; imports, \u00a399,670. The population is reckoned as part of the population of R\u00e1j\u00e1pur, and is about 2000\u2014mostly Muhammadan. The town, 4 miles from the entrance of the R\u00e1j\u00e1pur river, is a place of call for coasting steamers, which stop tri-weekly for passengers going to and from R\u00e1j\u00e1pur. The port is said to be well sheltered from all winds. It has a custom house, post-office, and vernacular school. Formerly one of the chief ports of the Konk\u00e1n: then known as Cetapur, R\u00e1j\u00e1pur, or Suitapur. The Jait\u00e1pur lighthouse is placed on the mainland at the southern point of the R\u00e1j\u00e1pur Hill. Height of lantern above the sea, 99 feet; in clear weather its light is seen from a distance of 9 miles.\n\n**Jaitpur.**\u2014Decayed town in Ham\u00edrpur District, North-Western Provinces, and former capital of a Native State. Lat. 25\u00b0 15' 35\" N., and long. 79\u00b0 36' 25\" E. Population (1872) 5159; (1881) 5440, namely, Hindus, 4830, and Muhammadans, 610. Area of town site, 172 acres. Picturesquely situated on the banks of the Bela T\u00e1l, 65 miles south-west of Ham\u00edrpur. Probably founded in the early part of the 18th century by Jagatr\u00e1j, son of the famous Bundela R\u00e1j\u00e1, Chhatar S\u00e1l, who built the large fort still in existence. His descendants held the town and surrounding principality until a period subsequent to the British conquest of Bundelkhand; but on the occasion of our reverses at K\u00e1b\u00fal in 1842, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Parichat broke into rebellion, and, being captured, died a pensioner at Cawnpur, while his territories reverted to the British Government. His widow still resides at Naug\u00e1on, and receives a pension of \u00a3200 per annum. Khet Singh, a member of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Parichat's family, was put in his place; but having died without legitimate issue, the State, already placed temporarily in charge of British officers on account of financial embarrassments, was formally annexed. The town resembles a collection of separate villages, fully 2 miles in length, but very narrow. Handsome temple; two forts, one of which could contain almost the whole population; police outpost; village school. Small trade in grain; manufacture and dyeing of\ncountry cloth. The Bela T\u00e1l, a tank or lake, dammed up with solid masonry by the Chandel rulers of Mahob\u00e1 in the 9th century, extends for 5 miles in circumference, but is now very shallow, the embankment having burst in 1869. Two canals, deriving their supply from the tank, irrigated an area of 526 acres in 1881-82. For police and conservancy purposes a small house-tax is raised under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856.\n\nJ\u00e1jamau.\u2014Town in Unao District, Oudh; situated 1 mile north of the Ganges, and 22 north-west of Unao town. Lat. 26\u00b0 56' N., and long. 80\u00b0 14' E. Founded in the reign of Aurangzeb by J\u00e1ji Singh Chandel, ancestor of the present talukd\u00e1r. Population (1881) 859, exclusively Hindus.\n\nJajhoti.\u2014Ancient name of Bandelkhand.\n\nJ\u00e1jmau.\u2014Head-quarters tahsil of Cawnpur District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the banks of the Ganges, which forms its north-eastern boundary, and containing the city of Cawnpur. It is traversed throughout its length by the Cawnpur branch of the Lower Ganges Canal. The Rind river forms the southern boundary of the tahsil, and the P\u00e1ndu flows through its centre. The soil is largely cut up by ravines. Area, 269 square miles, of which 121 are cultivated. Population (1872), including the city of Cawnpur, 267,286; (1881) 289,333, namely, males 159,063, and females 130,270. Increase of population during the nine years, 22,047, or 8\u00b72 per cent. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 244,872; Muhammadans, 41,102; Jains, 114; \u2018others\u2019 (mainly European troops forming the garrison of Cawnpur), 3245. Of the 220 villages comprising the tahsil, 144 contained less than five hundred inhabitants. Land revenue, \u00a326,320; total Government revenue, \u00a329,485; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a343,997; incidence of Government revenue, 3s. 7d. per acre.\n\nJ\u00e1jmau.\u2014Town in J\u00e1jmau tahsil in Cawnpur District, North-Western Provinces; situated on the right bank of the Ganges. Lat. 26\u00b0 26' N., long. 80\u00b0 28' E.; 6 miles south-east of Cawnpur city by land and 5 by water. Now an unimportant village, but once of some note. It was anciently styled Siddhpuri, and still contains a landing-stage and temples dedicated to Siddheswar and Siddha Dev\u00ed. The high mound overhanging the river is known as the fort of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jij\u00e1t Chandrabansi, whom the Chandels claim as their ancestor. Disgusted at the failure of a sacrifice made for a special purpose, he made over the fort, with its appanage of 17 villages, to a man of the sweeper caste. South of the fort rises the tomb of Makhd\u00fam Sh\u00e1h, built about 600 years ago; and on the castle mound itself stands a mosque dating from the 17th century. The residents of this and the surrounding villages celebrate the holi festival five days after the usual date. They say that, many ages back,\non the holi and four following days, a fierce battle was raging between\nthe Muhammadans and the Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1; and in honour of the victory\nthen gained, the Hindus have ever since kept this holiday on the same\ndate as that on which they were forced to keep it in that year.\n\nJ\u00e1ipur.\u2014Sub-division of Cuttack District, Bengal. Area, 1104\nsquare miles; number of villages, 3989; houses, 91,181. Population\n(1872) 428,517; (1881) 499,498, namely, males 240,341, and females\n259,157. Total increase during the nine years ending 1881, 70,981,\nor 16\u00b756 per cent. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\n\u2014Hindus, 487,748; Muhammadans, 11,248; Christians, 105; ab-\noriginal tribes, 28; \u2018others,\u2019 369. Density of population, 452 per\nsquare mile; villages per square mile, 3\u00b761; persons per village, 125;\nhouses per square mile, 86; inmates per house, 5\u00b75. This Sub-division\ncomprises the 2 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of J\u00e1ipur and Dharm\u00e1s\u00e1l\u00e1. One\nmagisterial and 1 civil revenue court in 1883; regular police, 82\nmen; village watch, 1466 men.\n\nJ\u00e1ipur.\u2014Town, municipality, and head-quarters of J\u00e1ipur Sub-\ndivision, Cuttack District, Bengal; on the right bank of the Baitaran\u00ed\nriver, in lat. 20\u00b0 50\u2032 45\u2033 N., long. 86\u00b0 22\u2032 56\u2033 E. Population\n(1872) 10,753; (1882) 11,233, namely, Hindus, 10,611; Muham-\nmadans, 616; and \u2018others,\u2019 6. Area of town site, 2891 acres.\nGross municipal revenue (1881-82), \u00a3279; rate of taxation, 5\u00bdd.\nper head of population. The town contains the usual sub-\ndivisional and public buildings; charitable dispensary; Govern-\nment-aided Anglo-veracular school, etc. It was the chief town of\nthe Province under the Kesari dynasty until the 11th century, when\nit was superseded by Cuttack, the modern capital. J\u00e1ipur is celebrated\nfor its settlements of Br\u00e1hman Sivaite priests, and as the head-quarters\nof one of the four regions of pilgrimage into which Orissa is divided,\nviz. that sacred to Parvat\u00ed, the wife of the All-Destroyer. In J\u00e1ipur\nare numerous ruins of Sivaite temples, sculptures, etc. For a descrip-\ntion of these remains, see Statistical Account of Bengal, xviii. pp. 85\u201389\n(quoted from Orissa). In the 16th century, this town was the scene\nof the struggle between Musalm\u00e1n and Hindu power, from which it\nemerged in ruins. However, it still ranks as the fifth town of Orissa,\nand derives much wealth from its yearly fair in honour of Barun\u00ed,\n\u2018Queen of the Waters,\u2019 on which occasion crowds of pilgrims flock to\nbathe in the holy Baitaran\u00ed, the Styx of Hindu mythology.\n\nJ\u00e1ipur.\u2014Town in Udaipur (Oodeypore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, Central\nIndia. Lat. 25\u00b0 38\u2032 N., long. 75\u00b0 19\u2032 E.; lies 63 miles south-east of\nNas\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d (Nusseer\u00e1b\u00e1d), and 278 north-west of S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor).

A fort of considerable strength, situated\non an isolated peak, commands the pass leading from Bund\u00ed (Boondee)\ninto Udaipur.\nJ\u00e1khan.\u2014Petty State in Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r Division, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. Lies 4 miles east of Limbdi railway station. Population, 703 in 1881. It consists of 1 village, with 2 independent tribute-payers. The revenue is estimated at \u00a3157; and tribute of \u00a324, 4s. is paid to the British Government, and of \u00a34, 12s. to Jun\u00e1gahr.\n\nJakh\u00e1u.\u2014Seaport in the Nativ\u00e9 State of Cutch (Kachh), Bombay Presidency. Lat. 23\u00b0 14' 30\" N., long. 68\u00b0 45' E.; lies 64 miles southwest of Bhuj. Population (1872) 5145; (1881) 4930, namely, Hindus, 1843; Muhammadans, 2094; Jains, 993. The town of Jakh\u00e1u is on the south-west coast of Cutch, between 3 and 4 miles inland, in a plain bare of trees but yielding abundant crops. The landing-place is at Godia creek, 5 miles from the sea. Godia creek, dry at low-water, has a depth of from 8 to 12 feet at full tide. At springs, boats of from 20 to 25 tons burden can pass up. There is a stretch of backwater from the Indus to the Godia creek, known as Bagda, navigable for craft of 8 and 10 tons all the year round. Jakh\u00e1u carries on a large trade with Bombay, exporting grain and importing piece-goods, groceries, timber, sugar, oil, and dates.\n\nJakkat\u00e1la.\u2014Military station in the N\u00edlgiri Hills, Madras.\u2014See WELLINGTON.\n\nJako.\u2014Mountain peak in Simla District, Punjab, overhanging the station of Simla. Lat. 31\u00b0 5' N., long. 77\u00b0 15' E. The ridge, upon which stands the sanitarium and summer capital, culminates eastward in this noble height, 8000 feet above sea-level, and 1000 feet above the general elevation of the houses. Woods of deod\u00e1r, pine, oak, and rhododendron clothe its sides and summit. Its circuit, by a tolerably level road, about 1000 feet below the peak, measures just 5 miles. The houses of Simla Station cluster most thickly upon the flanks of Jako and two neighbouring hills.\n\nJal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014District in the K\u00e1b\u00fal Province, Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n; lies north and south of the K\u00e1b\u00fal river. The District of Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d is about 80 miles long from east to west, and, on an average, 35 miles broad from north to south. To the east it extends to the western mountains of the Kh\u00e1ibar and B\u00e1z\u00e1r. On the south it is bounded by the Safed Koh range. On the west the boundary is a lofty spur from the Safed Koh, called Karkacha, between the valleys of Gandamak and Jagdalak. North of the K\u00e1b\u00fal river the surface of the District is diversified by spurs of the Safed Koh; south of the river it is an irregular undulating tract, enclosing the small plains of Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, Ch\u00e1rdeh, Peshbol\u00e1k, Batikot, and others, covered with low, bare, and stony hills, and intersected by numerous streams from the Safed Koh. The district is entirely surrounded by hills, on one of which Noah\u2019s Ark is fabled to have rested. Two main roads traverse the District from east to\nwest, the one, after a certain portion of its course, joining the other at Gandamak.\n\nJal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d is divided for revenue purposes into eight sub-divisions. The principle of revenue administration is that Government takes one-third of the gross produce of the soil. The inhabitants of the District belong to many races and tribes, a small proportion of Hindus living as traders in every large village. The language of this part of the country is Pusht\u00fa, but many tribes use Persian, and some have dialects peculiar to themselves. Certain tribes, the K\u00fach\u00eds in especial, among whom are a percentage of Arabs, are migratory, and move to the region about K\u00e1b\u00fal as the hot weather approaches. The climate of the Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d District bears a general resemblance to that of Pesh\u00e1war, but for two months the heat in the plains is excessive. Rain falls abundantly, the showers of the b\u00e1d-i-bars\u00e1t corresponding to the commencement of the rainy season in India. Fevers and small-pox are common; vaccination, except by the native method of inoculation, is unknown; eye diseases develop in the hot weather. During the winter, shocks of earthquake are frequent.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014There are no towns of importance in the District, and only the low-lying parts in addition to the banks of the streams are cultivated. In secluded valleys the cultivation of fruit is engaged in, and travellers describe the blending together of orchard, garden, and field. The r\u00e1b\u00ed, or spring harvest, when the Safed Koh has sent down its supply of water from the melted snows, comprises large crops of wheat, barley, peas, opium, mustard, and linseed. The khar\u00edf, or autumn harvest, is of cotton, jo\u00e1r, rice, and b\u00e1jra. Melons, cucumbers, pumpkins, and turnips are also grown. Wheat and jo\u00e1r are the staple food of the people. In a small portion of the District the ancient custom of vesh, or redistribution of all the lands of the community at stated intervals, is found to exist.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The civil administration of the District is entrusted to a governor, or h\u00e1kim, whose authority, however, is not exercised over the military commanders appointed by the K\u00e1b\u00fal Darb\u00e1r. The h\u00e1kim has a nominal salary, but carries on the revenue system by farming the taxes, levying fines, and by miscellaneous exaction. There is no regular administration of justice; civil disputes are referred to a Muhammadan Mull\u00e1 or K\u00e1zi by mutual consent.\n\nThe name Nangnah\u00e1r is applied to the southern portion of Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d District, including the district of Laghm\u00e1n. Laghm\u00e1n, properly Lamgh\u00e1n, is the seat of the ancient Lampagae. The name is almost certainly not connected with that of the patriarch Lamech, as the Musalm\u00e1ns assert, but is a distortion of the ancient Indian name Nagarah\u00e1ra, borne by a city in the Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d plain long before the time of Isl\u00e1m, and believed to have been the Nagara or Dionysopolis of\nPtolemy. Many *topes* and other Buddhist traces exist in the Laghm\u00e1n valley, but there are no buildings of any size intact.\n\n**History.**\u2014Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d city was founded in 1570 by Akbar the Great on his way back from K\u00e1b\u00fal to India. The fort was built in 1638 in the time of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. The annals of the District date from A.D. 977, and are mainly concerned with engagements that occurred in its valleys during the march of Afgh\u00e1n rulers towards Hindust\u00e1n; but the modern history of the town of Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d dates from 1834. In that year, after the B\u00e1ruzk\u00e1i Kh\u00e1ns had gained ascendancy over the S\u00e1duza\u00ed monarchs, Naw\u00e1b Zam\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, nephew of Az\u00edm Kh\u00e1n, was placed in the government of Nangnah\u00e1r, and retained it peaceably until the Am\u00edr of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, Dost Muhammad, presented himself with an army and a claim for revenue. The claim was arranged, and the Am\u00edr withdrew. The Naw\u00e1b set about the fortification of the town, and was busily engaged in the work when the Am\u00edr again appeared. The Naw\u00e1b resisted, but the town was seized and sacked. The Am\u00edr placed two of his brothers successively in the governorship.\n\nJal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d has twice been occupied by British troops. First in the course of the Afgh\u00e1n war of 1839\u201342, when Sir Robert Sale, in command of the \u2018illustrious garrison,\u2019 stoutly held out against the Afgh\u00e1n rebel leader, Muhammad Akbar Kh\u00e1n, from November 1841 to April 1842, until relieved by General Pollock. The siege was memorable for the gallantry of its defenders. The *enceinte* of the town was over 2100 yards in extent, out of all proportion to the powers of the besieged; it was protected by no parapet except for a few hundred yards, and for that distance by one only 2 feet high; the ramparts were ruins over which roads led into the country; inside the walls the population was disaffected; outside, 5000 insurgents occupied the many ruined tombs, mosques, forts, walls, and gardens from which a fire could be opened at 20 or 30 yards on those inside the city. The British forces at their entrance had only provisions for two days, and with a small garrison were compelled to make constant sallies. By February 1842 the town had been rendered defensible, but in that month an earthquake rendered the previous work ineffectual. The \u2018illustrious garrison,\u2019 however, held out. On the 7th April, an attack was made upon the enemy, which had the effect of raising the blockade; and a week afterwards General Pollock marched in to the relief. Earlier in the same year (1842), Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d was reached by Dr. Brydon, the sole survivor of General Elphinstone\u2019s army. The second occasion on which Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d was occupied by British troops was during the Afgh\u00e1n war of 1879\u201380. The fort, or Bala Hissar, was put into thorough repair, and quarters and hospitals were built. While the campaign lasted, the town was an *entrep\u00f4t* for all kinds of military stores, and the head-quarters of the Kh\u00e1ibar division.\n\n**Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Town in Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n; lies at a\nheight of 1946 feet, in the midst of a cultivated plain on the south of the K\u00e1b\u00fal river. Lat. 34\u00b0 24' N., long. 70\u00b0 26' E. Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d is by road 100 miles from K\u00e1b\u00fal, and 91 from Pesh\u00e1war. Between it and Pesh\u00e1war intervene the Kh\u00e1i-bar and other adjoining passes; between it and K\u00e1b\u00fal, the passes of Jagdalak, Khurd-K\u00e1b\u00fal, etc. In 1840, the town, though its walls had an extent of 2100 yards, contained only 300 houses, and a permanent population of 2000. The walls formed an irregular quadrilateral in a ruinous state, surrounded on all sides by buildings, gardens, the remains of the ancient walls, etc., affording abundant cover to an assailant. According to Burnes, Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d is one of the filthiest towns in the East. It is advantageously situated for trade, as, besides being on the high-road between Pesh\u00e1war and K\u00e1b\u00fal, roads lead from it to Derbend, Kashm\u00edr, Ghazn\u00ed, B\u00e1mi\u00e1n, and Y\u00e1rkand.\n\n**Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Town in Hardoi District, Oudh; 6 miles south-east of Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n town. Population (1881) 1857, chiefly Kanaujia Br\u00e1hmans, residing in 313 mud houses. Bi-weekly market.\n\n**Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Town in Muzaffarnagar District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 29\u00b0 37' N., long. 77\u00b0 28' 45\" E. Situated near the little river Krishni, 21 miles north-west of Muzaffarnagar town, on the road from Delhi to Sah\u00e1ranpur. Population (1872) 6904; (1881) 6592, namely, Hindus, 3065; Jains, 44; and Muhammadans, 3483, the latter chiefly Path\u00e1ns. Area of town site, 155 acres. For police and conservancy purposes, a house-tax is levied under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856. Large market on Sundays and Fridays. The celebrated fort of Ghausgarh, built by the Rohill\u00e1 leader Naj\u00edb Kh\u00e1n, lay at a short distance from the town. Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d was often sacked by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s during the rule of Z\u00e1bita Kh\u00e1n, and one member of that race still holds revenue-free grants in the neighbourhood. The Sikhs afterwards harried the country; and nothing now remains of the site of Ghausgarh except mud walls, scattered bricks, a well 15 feet in diameter, and the ruins of a mosque. The town still possesses a considerable trade in local produce, and a channel of the Eastern Jumna Canal irrigates the surrounding country. The Path\u00e1ns of Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d remained quiet during the Mutiny of 1857, and one of their principal leaders did good service as tahsild\u00e1r of Th\u00e1na Bahw\u00e1n after its capture.\n\n**Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Southern tahsil of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the north bank of the Ganges, and also intersected by the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 and Sot rivers and other minor streams. The tahsil includes three distinct tracts of soil\u2014(1) The bhur or sandy tract in the extreme east, with an area of about 40 square miles, producing poor crops of wheat as the spring, and b\u00e1jra as the autumn harvest. (2) The tard\u00ed tract in the centre, including the valleys of the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 and Bahgul, the soil of which consists of a fine alluvial\ndeposit, yielding rich crops of wheat with little labour, and without the necessity of irrigation; area, 128 square miles. (3) The bankati tract, extending from the valley of the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 to the Ganges, with an area of nearly 140 square miles, consisting of a hard clay soil, with a large extent of dh\u00e1k jungle and grass land intersected by numerous flood-watercourses draining into the Sot river. Cultivation in this tract is very laborious, and frequent and copious irrigation is necessary to prevent the soil from hardening and cracking into wide fissures. When properly cared for, however, it produces very good wheat and millet. Two metalled and two unmetalled roads intersect the tahsil, besides the ordinary cross country cart roads. The bankati tract, however, is badly off for roads, and those which exist are difficult to traverse in the cold weather, and are utterly impracticable during the rains, owing to the numerous watercourses and flood-channels. Water communication for large boats is afforded by the Ganges and R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 rivers, along which a considerable traffic is carried on. The total area of the tahsil in 1881\u201382 was 329.1 square miles, of which 183.6 square miles were returned as under cultivation, 100 square miles as cultivable, and 45.5 square miles as uncultivable waste. Population (1872) 165,763; (1881) 145,915, namely, males 79,990, and females 65,925, showing a decrease of 19,848, or 11.9 per cent., during the nine years. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 133,435; Muhammadans, 12,477; and \u2018others,\u2019 3. Out of 356 inhabited villages, 268 contained less than five hundred inhabitants. Land revenue (1881\u201382), \u00a321,132; total Government revenue, including local rates and cesses, \u00a323,688; rental paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a347,158. The tahsil contains 2 criminal courts, the civil jurisdiction being included with that of the Tilhar munsifi. Strength of regular police, 63 officers and men, besides a rural police force of chaukid\u00e1rs.\n\nJal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Town in Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil. Situated in lat. 27\u00b0 43' 20\" N., and long. 79\u00b0 41' 53\" E., on the plain 2 miles north of the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 river and 19 miles south of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur city. Population (1872) 7127; (1881) 8025, namely, Hindus, 4077; Muhammadans, 3945; and \u2018others,\u2019 3. Area of town site, 117 acres. For police and conservancy purposes, a house-tax is levied under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856. An almost purely agricultural town. Boats from Cawnpur ascend the R\u00e1mgang\u00e1 as far as Kola Gh\u00e1t, opposite this town, where they receive cargoes of wheat and other food-stuffs. Bi-weekly markets are held on Mondays and Thursdays, but the trade of the place has much fallen off of late years, traffic having been diverted by the opening of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. The public buildings consist of the usual tahsili courts and offices, police station, post-office, and Anglo-\nvernacular school. The town is described as having a miserable appearance; the houses are nearly all mud-built, the bazar small, the shops few, and the roadway unmetalled.\n\nJalali.\u2014Town in Koil tahsil, Aligarh District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 27\u00b0 51' 35\" N., long. 78\u00b0 17' 35\" E.; 14\u00bd miles south-east of Aligarh town, on the route from Aligarh to Bud\u00e1un. Population (1881) 4939, namely, 2831 Hindus, and 2108 Muhammadans. Area, 44 acres. For police and conservancy purposes, a house-tax is levied under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856. The town stands on a high site, between two raised distributaries of the Ganges Canal, but in an isolated position, and with no good roads. The most noteworthy inhabitants are the Sayyids, Shi\u00e1s by sect, a large and influential body, who are regarded as the leaders of their sect in the Upper Do\u00e1b. They are the descendants of one Kam\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn, who settled in the town about 1295 A.D., in the reign of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn. During the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, this Sayyid family became sufficiently powerful to expel the old Path\u00e1n landholders, and thus obtained the full proprietary rights in the town which they still possess. 'These rights,' says the Settlement Officer, 'have since become so sub-divided that the individual shares are scarcely worth retaining. The reputation of the family is due to their having given so many useful subordinate officers to the British Government. Among its co-sharers, the village can boast of an exceptionally numerous body of men, who have obtained, or are now obtaining, distinction in both the military and civil services.' The town contains upwards of eighty mosques, of which thirty are of good size, one being a handsome building. The streets are narrow, tortuous, and unmetalled. There is no regular bazar, and no trade. The town is an essentially agricultural one, inhabited by landholders and cultivators. Camping ground half a mile from the town.\n\nJal\u00e1lkher\u00e1.\u2014Town in N\u00e1gpur District, Central Provinces. Lat. 21\u00b0 23' N., long. 78\u00b0 27' E.; about 14 miles west of K\u00e1tol, near the junction of the J\u00e1n with the Wardh\u00e1. Population (1881) 897, chiefly cultivators. According to tradition, the place once contained 30,000 inhabitants, but was ruined by the ravages of a band of Path\u00e1ns. The remains of a large fort, said to be of Gaul\u00ed origin, still exist; and for 2 square miles around the village may be found traces of the old town. Probably Jal\u00e1lkher\u00e1 once formed a single large city, with Amner on the Ber\u00e1r side of the river.\n\nJal\u00e1lpur.\u2014Sub-division of Surat District, Bombay Presidency. On the north the Sub-division is separated by the Purna river from Baroda territories; on the east it is bounded by the Baroda Sub-division of Mahuwa; on the south by the river Ambika; on the west by the Arabian Sea. It forms a tract about 20 miles long and 16 broad. The area is returned at 189 square miles. Population (1881) 74,016;\naverage density, 392 persons per square mile. Since 1872, the population has increased by 3904. In 1881 Hindus numbered 63,608, or 86 per cent. of the total; Muhammadans, 5428; 'others,' 4980. According to the statistics of 1873-74 (the most recent available), 94.7 per cent. of the cultivable land was then under cultivation. There are 91 villages in the Sub-division; houses, 14,680. The Sub-division of Jal\u00e1lpur is a level plain of deep alluvial soil, sloping towards the sea, where it ends in a salt marsh. Along the coast-line low sandhills appear at intervals. With the exception of the salt lands near the coast, the Sub-division is rich, highly cultivated, and well supplied with water, groves of fruit trees, and valuable timber. The villages are large and prosperous. Besides the salt marsh on the coast, there are extensive salt marshes along the banks of the Purna and Ambika rivers, which flow through the Sub-division. In 1875, of the whole 31,360 acres of salt marsh, more than half (16,794) were undergoing reclamation. The reclaimed land has been made to yield a small return of rice. In 1873-74, 62 per cent. of the cultivable land was under grain. Jo\u00e1r, b\u00e1jra, and rice are the staple crops. Miscellaneous crops are pulses, gram, oil-seeds, sugar-cane, and plantain. The climate is mild and healthy throughout the year. Average rainfall, 54 inches. The land revenue (1881) was \u00a333,795. The Sub-division contains 2 criminal courts, with 1 police station (th\u00e1na); strength of regular police, 22 men; village watchmen (chauki\u00e1d\u00e1rs), 720.\n\nJal\u00e1lpur.\u2014Tahsil of Ham\u00edrpur District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the south bank of the river Betw\u00e1, now known as Muskara (q.v.).\n\nJal\u00e1lpur.\u2014Town and municipality in Gujr\u00e1t tahsil and District, Punjab. Lat. 32\u00b0 21' 35\" N., long. 74\u00b0 15' E.; 8 miles north-east of Gujr\u00e1t town. Population (1868) 15,526; (1881) 12,839, namely, Muhammadans, 9496; Hindus, 3331; and Sikhs, 12. Number of houses, 2733. Municipal revenue (1882-83), \u00a3787, derived from octroi, or an average of 1s. 2\u00bdd. per head. Jal\u00e1lpur is situated in an open and highly-cultivated country, at the junction of cross roads leading to Si\u00e1lkot, Jehlam, Jamu, and Gujr\u00e1t. It has a good b\u00e1z\u00e1r and a large number of well-built houses. It is the second principal town in Gujr\u00e1t District, and carries on a considerable shawl manufacture, the work of a Kashmiri colony. The manufacture, however, has greatly declined since the Franco-Prussian war, owing to the French demand for these goods having fallen off. The town contains a well-attended Government school, a town hall, commodious sar\u00e1\u00ed with accommodation for European travellers, police station, and dispensary.\n\nJal\u00e1lpur.\u2014Village and municipality in Lodhr\u00e1n tahsil, Mult\u00e1n (Mooltan) District, Punjab. Lat. 29\u00b0 30' 15\" N., long. 71\u00b0 16' E.; lying in the tongue of land between the Sutlej and the Trim\u00e1b, twelve miles\nfrom their confluence. Population (1881) 3875, namely, Muhammadans, 2257; Hindus, 1613; and Sikhs, 5. Number of houses, 622. Municipal revenue (1882-83), \u00a3240, or 1s. 2\u00bdd. per head of population. The town consists of a collection of brick houses, surrounded by an embankment to protect them from river inundation. A fine domed building, covered with blue glazed tiles, marks the tomb of a saint, Sayyid Sult\u00e1n Ahmad, who bears to this day a great reputation for casting evil spirits out of possessed persons. The trade of the town has decayed since the opening of the Indus Valley Railway. Manufacture of paper of excellent quality. The public buildings consist of a municipal office, police station, school-house, and sar\u00e1\u00ed (native inn).\n\nJal\u00e1lpur.\u2014Ancient ruined town in Jehlam (Jhelum) tahsil of Jehlam District, Punjab. Situated in lat. 32\u00b0 39' 30\" N., and long. 73\u00b0 27' E., close to the right bank of the Jehlam river. Head-quarters of a subordinate police jurisdiction. The village has been identified by General Cunningham with the site of the ancient Bucephala, built by Alexander the Great in memory of his famous charger, which was killed in the battle with Porus at the crossing of the Jehlam. Remains of ancient walls still crown the summit of the hills, which rise to a height of 1000 feet above the village. Coins found among the ruins date back to the period of the Gr\u00e6co-Bactrian kings. Even in the time of Akbar, the town covered a site four times as large as that which it now occupies; but since the foundation of Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n, and the shifting of the river channel 2 miles eastward, it has undergone a constant decay. Jal\u00e1lpur is now nothing more than a small agricultural village, of no commercial or other importance, apart from the interest attaching to its antiquarian remains.\n\nJal\u00e1lpur-Dehi.\u2014Town in Dalmau tahsil, R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli District, Oudh; 8 miles east of Dalmau, and 18 south-east of R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli town. Lat. 26\u00b0 2' N., long. 81\u00b0 62' E. Founded close to the site of an ancient and ruined town, named Dehi, by one Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn, upon whom it was conferred as a j\u00e1gir by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sharki of Jaunpur. Population (1881), Hindus, 1116; Muhammadans, 669; total, 1885, residing in 362 houses. Government vernacular school. A bi-weekly market is held at a little distance from the village.\n\nJal\u00e1lpur-Nahvi.\u2014Town in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Oudh; 52 miles from Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d town. Lat. 26\u00b0 37' 10\" N., long. 82\u00b0 10' 30\" E. Pleasantly situated on the banks of the Tons river, which here runs in a winding channel, between high and precipitous banks. Population (1881), Muhammadans, 3792; Hindus, 2446; 'others,' 2; total, 6240. Area of town site, 291 acres. A flourishing weaving town. An im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra outside the town was built about a century ago, at a cost of \u00a3400, by contributions from the weaving community, each man\ncontributing a quarter of a pice for each piece of cloth wrought by him. The circumstance was brought to the notice of the King of Oudh, who highly commended the weavers for their piety and liberality, and ordered them to continue the subscription, but to pay the proceeds into the royal treasury as a contribution to himself.\n\nJ\u00e1landhar (Jullundur).\u2014A Division or Commissionership in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, comprising the three Districts of J\u00c1LANDHAR, HOSHIARPUR, and KANGRA, each of which see separately. Lat. $30\u00b0\\ 56' \\ 30\"$ to $32\u00b0\\ 59' \\ N.$, long. $75\u00b0\\ 6' \\ 30\"$ to $77\u00b0\\ 49' \\ 15\"$ E. Area of J\u00e1landhar Division, 12,571 square miles, with 31 towns and 3951 villages; number of houses, 507,838, of which 384,189 are occupied and 123,649 unoccupied. Total population (1881) 2,421,781, namely, males 1,293,828, and females 1,127,953; proportion of males in total population, 53.4 per cent.; number of families, 538,226. Average density of population, 193 per square mile; persons per town or village, 608; persons per occupied house, 6.3.\n\nAs regards religion, Hindus numbered 1,576,112, or 65.08 per cent. of the population; Muhammadans, 687,942, or 28.40 per cent.; Sikhs, 150,842, or 6.23 per cent.; Buddhists, 2860; Jains, 1942; Christians, 2056; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 8; and \u2018others,\u2019 19. Classified ethnically, apart from religion, the population consists of the following tribes and castes, including Hindus, Muhammadans, Sikhs, etc.:\u2014J\u00e1ts, 320,618; R\u00e1jputs, 238,009; Cham\u00e1rs, 231,041; Br\u00e1hmans, 217,828; Arains, 163,191; G\u00fajars, 95,156; and Tarkhans, 70,551. The exclusively Muhammadan classes, by race as apart from religion, includes\u2014Path\u00e1ns, 13,417; Shaikhs, 18,351; Sayyids, 11,126; and Mughals, 3351. The urban population in 31 towns and municipalities is returned at 235,676, or 9.7 per cent. of the entire population of the Division. Rural population, 2,186,105, or 90.3 per cent. Of the 3982 towns and villages, 2556 are returned as containing less than five hundred inhabitants; 850 from five hundred to a thousand; 407 from one to two thousand; 79 from two to three thousand; 56 from three to five thousand; 28 from five to ten thousand; and 6 over ten thousand. The adult male population is thus returned according to occupation\u2014(1) Professional class, 33,004; (2) domestic and menial class, 29,326; (3) commercial class, 14,012; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, 438,190; (5) industrial class, 53,496; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, 53,497; (7) unspecified, 43,977.\n\nOf a total assessed area of 7,405,942 acres in 1878\u201379, as shown in the last quinquennial return of agricultural statistics, 2,058,796 acres were under cultivation, of which 415,573 acres were artificially irrigated by private irrigation. Of the remaining or uncultivated area, 3157 acres were returned as grazing land, 315,184 acres as cultivable but not under cultivation, and 5,028,805 acres as\nuncultivable waste, nearly nine-tenths of which is included in the mountainous District of Kangra. The annual average area under crops for the five years 1877-78 to 1881-82, was 2,124,777 acres, the area under the principal crops being\u2014Wheat, 779,969 acres; Indian corn, 332,303 acres; rice, 177,913 acres; barley, 116,621 acres; jo\u00e1r, 112,645 acres; gram, 112,381 acres; moth, 75,024 acres; sugar-cane, 92,146 acres; cotton, 55,597 acres; vegetables, 14,192 acres; tobacco, 8053 acres; indigo, 2348 acres; and poppy, 2026 acres.\n\nThe total revenue in 1881-82, excluding canals, forests, salt, assessed taxes, fees, and cesses, was \u00a3439,457, made up as follows:\u2014Land revenue, fixed and fluctuating, \u00a3312,397; tribute, \u00a323,100; stamps, \u00a347,337; excise, \u00a310,815; local rates, \u00a326,808. The Division is under the general control of the Commissioner of Jalandhar, assisted by a Judicial Commissioner. The administrative staff for the various Districts comprises 3 Deputy Commissioners, each with a Judicial Assistant, 3 Assistant Commissioners, 8 extra-Assistant Commissioners, 1 cantonment magistrate, 3 honorary magistrates, 13 tahsildars, and 13 munsifs, besides subordinate officials. For further details, see separate District articles on Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, and Kangra.\n\nJalandhar (Jullundur).\u2014British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between 30\u00b0 56' 30\" and 31\u00b0 37' N. lat., and between 75\u00b0 6' 30\" and 77\u00b0 49' 15\" E. long. Jalandhar forms the southernmost District in the Division of the same name. It is bounded on the north-east by the District of Hoshiarpur; on the north-west by the Native State of Kap\u00farthala; and on the south by the Sutlej (Satlaj), which separates it from Ludhi\u00e1n\u00e1 and Hoshiarpur Districts. Jalandhar stands thirtieth in order of area, and eighth in order of population, among the thirty-two Districts of the Province, comprising 1\u00b724 per cent. of the total area, 4\u00b719 per cent. of the total population, and 5\u00b762 per cent. of the urban population of British territory. The District is divided into four tahsils or Sub-divisions, of which the Jalandhar tahsil comprises the northern portion, and Nawashahr, Phillaur, and Nakod\u00e1r the southern portion, running in that order from east to west. Area, 1322 square miles; population (1881) 789,555 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Jalandhar.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The blunt triangular tongue of land, enclosed by the confluent streams of the Sutlej (Satlaj) and the Beas (Bi\u00e1s), bears the general name of the Jalandhar or Bist Do\u00e1b. Its submontane portion belongs to Hoshiarpur; the remainder is divided between the Native State of Kap\u00farthala and the British District of Jalandhar. Below the hills, the whole Do\u00e1b consists of one unbroken alluvial expanse, whose fertility extends without a single break from river to river. The Sikhs\nregarded it as the richest region in the Punjab plains; for although other tracts may be found of equal fruitfulness, in no other Do\u00e1b does the cultivated land stretch so far back from the river banks. The entire District lies within the zone of rich cultivable soil, the detritus of the mountain system, which skirts the foot of the Him\u00e1layas. At places, a few acres are covered with a sandy layer; but, except in these rare spots, one vast sheet of luxuriant and diverse vegetation spreads over the plain from end to end. Neither rock nor stone crops out in any part, nor does any eminence occur deserving the name of a hill. The highest point in the plateau, at R\u00e1hon, near the eastern corner of the District, has an elevation of 1012 feet above sea-level. Somewhat farther to the west, at the little town of Hi\u00fan, the general height sinks to 969 feet; and from this point westward the surface gradually falls away toward the Beas valley.\n\nA well-defined bank marks the bed of the Sutlej on the J\u00e1landhar side, below which stretches a tract of varying width, the bet or kh\u00e1dar, parts of which are annually fertilized by the deposit of silt during the inundations, and produce rich crops after their subsidence. The river contains in winter about 15 feet of water in its deepest parts, and it is navigable at all seasons for large flat-bottomed country boats of about 8 tons burden. The main channel shifts from year to year through the wide bed, often forming new islands by slight changes in its course. The present stream runs at an average distance of 6 miles from the high bank. Opposite Phillaur, the Sutlej is crossed by a bridge of the Punjab and Delhi Railway. During the cold weather, a bridge of boats is maintained across the river for the traffic of the Grand Trunk Road. The torrents from the Siw\u00e1lik Hills in Hoshi\u00e1rpur District eventually unite in two main streams, the White (or east) and the Black (or west) Ben, the former of which runs through J\u00e1landhar, while the latter holds its course through Kap\u00farthala territory. The White Ben receives numerous affluents from the Hoshi\u00e1rpur Hills, which meet it at right angles; and, following a serpentine path in a deep channel, finally falls into the Sutlej 4 miles above its junction with the Beas.\n\nSeveral marshy lakes (jh\u00edls) collect a considerable quantity of water in the rains, which they retain throughout the dry season. The largest is that of R\u00e1hon, at the eastern corner of the District. It measures about 8650 feet in length by nearly 3000 feet in breadth; extreme area of about 500 acres. The next largest jh\u00edl is near Phillaur, with a length of about 6500 feet and a breadth of about 1900 feet; extreme area about 250 acres. The nodular limestone formation, known as kankar, is found plentifully in the District, the best beds being within a radius of 10 miles from J\u00e1landhar town. The District is almost entirely free from dangerous animals. Wolves,\nhowever, are occasionally seen, and rewards are offered for their destruction. Numerous waterfowl frequent the various *jhils*; and towards Kap\u00farthala, antelope, *nilgai*, and hares are found.\n\n**History.**\u2014The J\u00e1landhar Do\u00e1b at a very early period formed a separate Hindu kingdom, ruled over by a family of Chandrabansi R\u00e1jputs, whose descendants still exist as petty chiefs in the K\u00e1ngra Hills. These R\u00e1j\u00e1s trace their origin to Susarma Chandra, one of the heroes of the great war recorded in the *Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata*, who retired from his ancestral realm of Mult\u00e1n (Mooltan) at the conclusion of the conflict, and founded the kingdom of Katoch or Traigartta in the J\u00e1landhar Do\u00e1b. The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Hwen Thsang, in the 7th century A.D., describes it as a large territory, including not only the present District, together with the Hoshi\u00e1rpur and K\u00e1ngra Hills, but also the modern States of Chamba, Mandi, and Sirhind. J\u00e1landhar then formed its capital, but K\u00e1ngra ranked as an important stronghold. We have no evidence in regard to the period at which the R\u00e1jput princes were driven out of their dominions in the plain country, and restricted to the hill tract over which their descendants still hold sway.\n\nA legend in the *Padma Pur\u00e1na* ascribes the foundation of J\u00e1landhar city to the great Daitya King J\u00e1landhara, who became invincible by the practice of unusual austerities. At length, however, Siva conquered him by a disgraceful fraud, and the Yoginis or female demons devoured his body. A local version varies the tale by declaring that the giant king was crushed to death under a mass of mountains, imposed on him by Siva; whereupon flames burst forth from his mouth, which lay under Jaw\u00e1la Mukhi, while his feet extended to the apex of the Do\u00e1b at Mult\u00e1n.\n\nUnder Muhammadan rule, the J\u00e1landhar Do\u00e1b was generally attached to the Province of Lahore, in which it is included as a *sark\u00e1r* in the great revenue survey of Akbar\u2019s reign. Its governors, however, seem usually to have held a partially independent position, subject to the payment of a fixed tribute into the imperial treasury. The last and most famous among them, Adina Beg, played an important part during the downfall of Muhammadan power in the Punjab. The Sikh reaction extended to J\u00e1landhar at an early period, and a number of petty chieftains established themselves by force of arms as independent princes throughout the Do\u00e1b. In 1766 the town of J\u00e1landhar fell into the hands of the Sikh *misl*, or confederacy, of Faiz-ull\u00e1-puria, then presided over by Khushhal Singh. His son and successor, Budh Singh, built a masonry fort in the city, while several other leaders similarly fortified themselves in the suburbs. Meanwhile, however, Ranjit Singh was consolidating his power in the south; and in 1811 he despatched D\u00edw\u00e1n Mokham Chand to annex the Faiz-ull\u00e1-puria dominions in the J\u00e1landhar Do\u00e1b. Budh Singh fled\nacross the Sutlej; and though his troops offered some little resistance to the invader, the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 successfully established his authority in the autumn of the same year. Thenceforth J\u00e1landhar became the capital of the Lahore possessions in the surrounding Do\u00e1b up till the date of British annexation. The petty sard\u00e1rs were gradually ousted from their estates, and the whole country brought under the direct management of the Sikh governors. Here, as elsewhere, the fiscal administration of the Sikhs proved very oppressive, especially under the last official appointed from the Court of Lahore, Shaikh Ghul\u00e1m Mohi-ud-d\u00edn, a tyrannical and grasping ruler, who exacted irregular taxes, and made over the tract to his son, Im\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn. Neither of these persons resided regularly in the Do\u00e1b, their charge being entrusted to lieutenants, the best known of whom were Sandi Kh\u00e1n in Hoshi\u00e1rpur, and Kar\u00edm Baksh in J\u00e1landhar.\n\nAt the close of the first Sikh war, immediately after the occupation of Lahore, the British Government annexed the whole tract of land between the Sutlej and the Beas, and erected the new acquisition into a Commissionership of the trans-Sutlej States. For two years the administration was directly dependent upon the Supreme Government. In 1848, however, the Commissioner became subordinate to the Resident at Lahore; and in the succeeding year, when events forced upon us the annexation of the entire Punjab, the administration of this Division was assimilated to the general system. The Commissioner's head-quarters were fixed at J\u00e1landhar, and three Districts were erected, having their centres at J\u00e1landhar, Hoshi\u00e1rpur, and K\u00e1ngra. The assessment of the revenue at the first introduction of British rule disregarded the excessive demands of Ghul\u00e1m Mohi-ud-d\u00edn and his son, and followed the milder system of his predecessor, Misr R\u00fap L\u00e1l, a Sikh ruler of exceptional humanity and justice, whose fiscal arrangements were found not unworthy of adoption under our own Government.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1855, the first that was taken in the Punjab, returned the population of the area at present included in the District of J\u00e1landhar at 698,169; while the Census of 1868 returned the population at 794,418. The last enumeration in 1881 disclosed a population of 789,555. The apparent decrease of 4863 persons in thirteen years is explained by the fact that in 1868 the District contained a large number of labourers employed on the railway, who afterwards returned to their own homes. The Census of 1881 was taken over an area of 1322 square miles; and it disclosed a total population of 789,555 souls, distributed among 1208 villages or towns, and residing in 115,663 houses. From these data the following averages may be deduced:\u2014Persons per square mile, 597; villages per square mile, 0'95; houses per square mile, 128; persons per village,\n653; persons per house, 6\u00b78; number of families, 181,369. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 431,435; females, 358,120; proportion of males, 54\u00b763 per cent. Classified according to age, there were over 15 years\u2014males, 271,746; females, 230,687; total adults, 502,433, or 63\u00b76 per cent. of the whole population. Children of 15 and under numbered\u2014males 159,689, and females 127,433; total children, 287,122, or 36\u00b74 per cent. of the entire population.\n\nClassified according to religious distinctions, Hindus numbered 338,292; Muhammadans, 358,601; Sikhs, 90,320; Jains, 690; Christians, 1631; and 'others,' 21. The tribal and caste division returns 163,757 Jats, of whom 143,664 are Hindus or Sikhs. They are an industrious, thriving race, who hold almost half the land, and pay more than half the revenue. The R\u00e1jputs number 43,789 souls, of whom all but 5608 are Muhammadans. Once the lords of the country, they are now sinking into the utmost poverty. The other races include 30,535 Br\u00e1hmans; 22,868 Khattris; 18,394 G\u00fajars; 7120 Kambohs; 3126 Baniy\u00e1s; and 123,323 Arains. The Muhammadans by race, as apart from religion, include 9720 Shaikhs, 6909 Sayyids, and 4808 Path\u00e1ns.\n\nThe District contained fourteen towns in 1881, whose names and populations were as follow:\u2014JALANDHAR (Jullundur), 52,119; KARTARPUR, 9260; ALAWALPUR, 3802; ADAMPUR, 2572; BANGA, 4565; NAWASHAHR, 4960; RAHON, 11,736; PHILLAUER, 7107; NURMAHAL, 8161; MAHATPUR, 6011; NAKODAR, 8486; BILGA, 6634; JANDIALA, 6316; and RURKHA KALAN, 5492. Of the 1208 villages and towns within the District in 1881, 270 had less than two hundred inhabitants; 467 between two hundred and five hundred; 298 between five hundred and a thousand; 129 between one thousand and two thousand; 16 between two thousand and three thousand; 17 between three thousand and five thousand; 9 between five and ten thousand; 1 between ten and fifteen thousand; and 1 with upwards of fifty thousand inhabitants.\n\nAs regards occupation, the male adult population exceeding 15 years of age is classified as follows in the Census Report of 1881:\u2014\n\n(1) Professional class, including all Government officials and the learned professions, 12,440; (2) domestic and menial class, 14,799; (3) commercial class, including merchants, carriers, etc., 5021; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 114,285; (5) industrial and manufacturing class, 72,554; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, 18,606; (7) unspecified, 34,042.\n\nThe language in common use is Punj\u00e1b\u00ed, but the peasantry generally understand Urdu.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The District contains a total cultivated area of 663,283\nacres, or 1036 square miles, of which 225,722 acres are artificially irrigated by private irrigation works. Of the remaining area, 1032 acres are returned as grazing land, 89,138 acres as available for cultivation, and 93,154 acres as uncultivable waste. Wheat, barley, and gram form the staples of the rabi or spring harvest, tobacco and poppy being the only other important items. For the kharif or autumn harvest, sugar-cane ranks as the most valuable crop; while millet, Indian corn, and other common food-grains also cover a considerable area. The lowlands of the Sutlej produce limited quantities of rice, and cotton and hemp are largely grown as autumn crops. Bajra is almost unknown. The area under the chief staples in 1882-83 was as follows:\u2014Wheat, 238,043 acres; barley, 11,763 acres; gram, 44,523 acres; rice, 6,407 acres; sugar-cane, 44,300 acres; Indian corn, 83,463 acres; joar, 89,370 acres; cotton, 23,236 acres; moth, 64,714 acres. The total area for the rabi in 1882-83 was 424,445 acres; and for the kharif, 347,493 acres. The sugar-cane crop is commercially of the most importance to the cultivator, and is generally grown for the purpose of paying the whole or greater part of the revenue. Rotation of crops is only practised in the simple form of sowing land with spring crops after a long continuance of autumn staples, and vice versa. Manure is used near the towns, but not so largely as is desirable. Except on the low alluvial tract of the Sutlej, irrigation is carried on only by means of wells, worked with Persian wheels. In a few villages along the high bank of the Ben, also, Persian wheels are worked from the river. But water everywhere lies near the surface, and is absolutely necessary for the higher cereals and sugar-cane, so that well irrigation prevails very generally.\n\nThe average produce per acre of the principal agricultural staples is returned as follows for 1882-83:\u2014Rice, 816 lbs.; cotton, 110 lbs.; wheat, 732 lbs.; inferior grains, 400 lbs.; refined sugar, 600 lbs.; tobacco, 1000 lbs.; oil-seeds, 320 lbs.; gram, 620 lbs.; barley, 920 lbs.; and joar, 240 lbs. The estimated agricultural stock in the District is thus returned\u2014Cows and bullocks, 446,682; horses, 3617; ponies, 1063; donkeys, 8501; sheep and goats, 44,987. The division of the land among individual proprietors has proceeded to a very great extent. Nearly one-half of the tenants possess rights of occupancy. Total amount of Government assessment in 1881, including rates and cesses on land, \u00a3135,418. Total estimated amount of rent paid by cultivators, \u00a3275,872. Rents range from 14s. 10\u00bdd. per acre for unirrigated wheat lands, to \u00a32, 8s. 6d. for rice, \u00a32, 11s. 1\u00bdd. for cotton, \u00a32, 17s. for sugar, and \u00a34, 11s. 6d. for tobacco. Agricultural labourers receive their payment in kind. In towns, where cash wages prevail, they range from 2\u00bdd. to 4\u00bdd. per diem for unskilled workmen. Prices of food-stuffs ruled as follows in January 1883:\u2014\nWheat, $26\\frac{1}{4}$ sers per rupee, or 4s. 3d. per cwt.; gram, 34 sers per rupee, or 3s. 4d. per cwt.; barley, 43 sers per rupee, or 2s. 7d. per cwt.; Indian corn, 40 sers per rupee, or 2s. 10d. per cwt.; j\u00f4\u00e1r, 36 sers per rupee, or 3s. 1d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The traffic of the District consists mainly in its agricultural produce. In ordinary years, grain is imported from Ludhi\u00e1n\u00e1, Firozpur, and the adjoining Sikh States, for export to the hills; but occasional favourable seasons in J\u00e1landhar, combined with high prices elsewhere, cause a large quantity of surplus grain to flow towards Agra and Bengal. Sugar-cane forms the chief commercial crop, and sugar and molasses are largely manufactured throughout the District, to supply the markets of Bikaner, Lahore, the Punjab, and Sind. The crushing of the cane goes on from the middle of November to the middle of February, after which the refining process takes place. Some of the larger villages have as many as fifty sugar-cane presses working during the season. Ropes are made from the refuse of the sugar-cane. The only other manufacture which is extensively carried on is that of country cloth, the principal seats of which are at J\u00e1landhar, R\u00e1hon, Kart\u00e1rpur, and N\u00farmahal. Silver wire and gold and silver lace are also made to some extent at J\u00e1landhar. The carpenter\u2019s work of Kh\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n\u00e1n, and the scarves and thick cotton cloth of R\u00e1hon are famous beyond the limits of the District. English piece-goods and draught cattle constitute the chief items of the import trade. The Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway enters the District by an iron bridge across the Sutlej, and has stations at Phillaur, Phagw\u00e1ra (in Kap\u00farthala State), J\u00e1landhar cantonment, J\u00e1landhar town, and Kart\u00e1rpur (for Kap\u00farthala town). It runs for a distance of 49 miles through the District. The Grand Trunk Road crosses the Sutlej by a bridge of boats at Phillaur, runs nearly parallel to the railway, and leaves the District a few miles beyond Kart\u00e1rpur. The Hoshi\u00e1rpur and K\u00e1ngra road is also metalled; total length of metalled roads, 86 miles. The District contains a total length of 373 miles of unmetalled road, and 80 miles of navigable river. The telegraph is in operation along the railway and the Grand Trunk Road.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District staff usually comprises a Deputy Commissioner, one or two Assistant Commissioners, and two or more extra-Assistant Commissioners, of whom one is a European, besides the usual fiscal and medical officers. The total revenue raised in the District in 1882\u201383 amounted to \u00a3174,597; of which sum the land-tax contributed \u00a3122,007, or more than four-fifths. The incidence of the land revenue is the heaviest in the Punjab, in spite of which it is collected with great facility. The average assessment is returned at 3s. 11\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)d. per acre of cultivation; 3s. 5\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)d. per cultivable acre; and 3s. 1d. per acre of settlement area. The regular police force in\n1882-83 consisted of 364 officers and men, supplemented by 100 municipal and 56 cantonment police. These figures show a total of 520 constables, being at the rate of 1 policeman to every 2.54 square miles of area and every 1,490 of the population. In addition to the District and municipal police, a force of 1,179 village watchmen is maintained, being paid by a regular assessment upon houses. The District jail received during the same year 1,005 prisoners, with a daily average of 327. It is in contemplation to build a larger and central jail at Jalandhar, with quarters for 950 prisoners. Education was carried on in 1882-83 by means of 157 Government and aided schools, with a total roll of 6,882 pupils, giving an average of 1 school to every 8.7 square miles, and 8.7 scholars to every thousand of the population. This is exclusive of private and uninspected schools; and the Census Report of 1881 returned 7,329 boys and 433 girls as under instruction, besides 21,933 males and 422 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. For fiscal and administrative purposes, the District is sub-divided into 4 tahsils or Sub-divisions and 9 thanas or police circles. The 11 municipal towns had an aggregate revenue of \u00a37025, or 1s. 1\u00bdd. per head of the population (119,311) within municipal limits.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The proximity of the hills renders the climate of Jalandhar comparatively moist. The annual rainfall for the thirty years ending 1881 averaged 28.49 inches. In 1881, the rainfall amounted to 34.63 inches, or 6.14 inches above the average. Malarious fever in an endemic form proves the chief cause of mortality, but small-pox often appears as an epidemic, and dysenteric complaints are of frequent occurrence. The total number of deaths recorded in 1882 was 16,839, or 21 per thousand; of which 10,904, or 13.81 per thousand, were due to fever alone. There are 7 charitable dispensaries in the District, supported by local funds, which afforded relief in 1882 to 81,074 persons, of whom 878 were in-patients. Their joint revenue amounted to \u00a310,516, of which \u00a3345 was contributed by private subscription.\n\n[For further information regarding Jalandhar, see the Settlement Report of the District, by Mr. (now Sir Richard) Temple, dated October 1851; the Gazetteer of Jalandhar District, compiled and published under the authority of the Punjab Government (1883-84); the Punjab Census Report for 1881; and the Provincial and Departmental Administration Reports from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nJalandhar (Jullundur).\u2014Northern tahsil of Jalandhar District, Punjab. Lat. 31\u00b0 12' to 31\u00b0 37' N., long. 75\u00b0 28' 15\" to 75\u00b0 51' 39\" E. Area, 392 square miles, with 39,380 houses. Population (1881) 243,759, namely, males 133,594, and females 110,165; average density of population, 622 per square mile. Number of families, 56,198. Of the 399 villages comprising the tahsil, 275 contain\nless than five hundred inhabitants, and 84 others from five hundred to a thousand. The Muhammadans, who form the majority of the population, number 121,215; Hindus, 95,786; Sikhs, 24,834; and 'others,' 1921. Total revenue, \u00a335,329. Of a total cultivated area of 191,412 acres in 1878-79, 45,485 acres were irrigated entirely by private enterprise. Of the uncultivated area, 32,672 acres were returned as cultivable but not under cultivation, and 59,482 acres as uncultivable waste. The annual average area under crops for the five years from 1877-78 to 1881-82 was 198,978 acres, the area under the principal crops being\u2014wheat, 101,588 acres; Indian corn, 21,058 acres; jo\u00e1r, 12,331 acres; moth, 15,199 acres; gram, 11,187 acres; barley, 3314 acres; rice, 2599 acres; sugar-cane, 10,419 acres; cotton, 6205 acres; and vegetables, 2677 acres. The administrative staff, including the Divisional and District head-quarters, consists of a Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner, 1 Deputy Commissioner, with 3 Assistants, Small Cause Court Judge, 1 tahsild\u00e1r, 2 munisifs, and 3 honorary magistrates. These officers preside over 11 civil and 12 criminal courts. Number of police stations (th\u00e1nd\u00e1s), 4; strength of regular police, 144 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 374.\n\nJ\u00e1landhar (Jullundur). \u2014 Town, cantonment, municipality, and administrative head-quarters of J\u00e1landhar District, Punjab. Lat. 31\u00b0 19' 36\" N., long. 75\u00b0 36' 48\" E. Situated on the open plain, traversed by the Grand Trunk Road, and also by the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway.\n\nJ\u00e1landhar lays claim to considerable antiquity, having been the original capital of the R\u00e1jput kingdom of Katoch, which dates back to the period anterior to Alexander's invasion, and is referred to the mythical epoch of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata. Hwen Thsang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim of the 7th century A.D., describes the town as 2 miles in circuit, the metropolis of a considerable State. Two ancient tanks alone attest the existence of the primitive Aryan city. Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sh\u00e1h of Ghazn\u00ed reduced the town to the Muhammadan yoke, and it appears as a place of considerable strength during the early Musalm\u00e1n times. Under the Mughal Empire it formed the capital of the Do\u00e1b between the Sutlej and the Beas. (See JALANDHAR DISTRICT.) The modern city consists of a cluster of wards (muhall\u00e1s), originally distinct, and each enclosed by a wall of its own. Some of them still remain detached, but the majority have now coalesced into one; the houses between the walls have sprung up irregularly of late years. Numerous important suburbs, known as bast\u00eds, surround the city at distances of a mile or more. There is a fine s\u00e1rd\u00ed, built by Shaikh Kar\u00edm Bakhsh, the local representative of Im\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn.\n\nThe population of J\u00e1landhar town, including the cantonments, amounted in 1868 to 50,067, and in 1881 to 52,119 souls, thus\ndistributed\u2014Muhammadans, 31,326; Hindus, 18,514; Sikhs, 363; Jains, 373; and 'others,' 1,543. Number of houses, 9043. Municipal income (1882-83), \u00a33358. The American Presbyterian Mission maintains an excellent school, which educates up to the matriculation standard of the Calcutta University, and with its two branches is attended by about 700 pupils of all castes and creeds. A female school with about 80 pupils is also maintained by the Mission; also a poorhouse, in which both in-door and out-door paupers receive relief. The trade, though considerable, presents little special interest. The staples of local traffic are English piece-goods for import and country produce for export. Railway stations both at the city and the cantonment. The cantonment, which stands at a distance of 4 miles from the city, was established in 1846. It has an area of $7\\frac{1}{4}$ square miles, and a population (1881) of 9,468 persons. The troops in garrison usually include 1 European infantry regiment, 1 battery of artillery, and 1 regiment of Native infantry.\n\n**Jalang\u00ed** (also called Khari\u00e1).\u2014One of the three great rivers of Nadiy\u00e1 District, Bengal; the other two being the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed and the Matabhanga. All three streams are offshoots of the Padm\u00e1, and they are generally known as 'the Nadiy\u00e1 Rivers.' Reference is made in the article on Nadiya District to the importance and difficulty of keeping these rivers open for navigation, and a very complete summary of the means taken by Government to effect this object will be found in the *Statistical Account of Bengal*, vol. ii. pp. 19-32. The Padm\u00e1 (pronounced P\u00e1dd\u00e1), which is here the main stream of the Ganges, throws off the Jalang\u00ed at the point where it enters Nadiy\u00e1 District (lat. $24\u00b0\\ 11' \\ N.$, long. $88\u00b0\\ 49' \\ E.$). From this starting-point, the Jalang\u00ed flows in an exceedingly tortuous course along the north-west of the District, forming, for a distance of 50 miles (between the villages of Jalang\u00ed and R\u00e1mnagar), the boundary between Nadiy\u00e1 and Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d Districts. It then turns to the south, and, after innumerable windings, reaches Krishnagar, the chief town of Nadiy\u00e1 District, which is situated on its left bank. From Krishnagar, the river flows west until it meets the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed at Nadiy\u00e1 town. The united stream thus formed takes the name of the Hugli (*q.v.*). The Jalang\u00ed, like the other head-waters of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, shows from time to time a tendency to deteriorate, by silting up, and by the formation of sandbanks or *chars*. Its condition as a waterway, and as one of the channels which feed the H\u00fagl\u00ed from the Ganges, is a subject of much importance to the trade of Calcutta. The principal marts on the banks of the river are (besides Krishnagar) Kar\u00edmpur, Ch\u00e1pr\u00e1, and Swar\u00fapganj; the trade is chiefly in grain, oil-seeds, and molasses. The rental of the Jalang\u00ed fisheries is valued at \u00a3200 per annum. During the rainy season, the Jalang\u00ed is navigable by large native boats up to\nabout 4 tons burden, but in the hot weather it is fordable at many points.\n\n**Jal\u00e1rapetta.**\u2014Town in Salem District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See JOLLARPET.\n\n**Jal\u00e1un.**\u2014British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between $25^\\circ 46'$ and $26^\\circ 26'$ N. lat., and between $78^\\circ 59'$ and $79^\\circ 56'$ E. long. Jal\u00e1un is the northern District of the Jh\u00e1nsi Division, situated in the tract of country west of the Jumna, known as Bundelkhand. It is bounded on the north-east and north by the river Jumna (Jamun\u00e1), on the west by the Gwalior and Datia States, on the south by the Samthar State and the river Betw\u00e1, and on the east by the B\u00e1oni State. Area, 1,469 square miles; population (1881) 418,142 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at Ur\u00e1i, but the most populous town in the District is Kalpi.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The District of Jal\u00e1un lies entirely within the level plain of Bundelkhand, north of the hill country, and almost surrounded by the Jumna and its tributaries, the Betw\u00e1 and the Pah\u00faj. The central region thus enclosed is a dead level of cultivated land, almost destitute of trees, and sparsely dotted with villages, many of them for long uninhabited. The southern portion especially presents one unbroken sheet of cultivation. Nearer to the rivers, the small streams have excavated for themselves a series of ravines, which drain the higher land dry, and so impoverish the soil. The sides of these ravines, which are covered with grass and jungle, compose the greater portion of the waste lands in the District. A few stunted trees also grow upon their slopes.\n\nThe boundary rivers form the only interesting feature in Jal\u00e1un. Of these, the great stream of the Jumna is the chief, and indeed the only navigable river, even during the rainy season. Its banks, here as elsewhere, are high on the southern side; but its bed is obstructed by numerous sandbanks and shallows. The Pah\u00faj, which forms the western boundary for the greater part of its course, has steep and rocky banks; and the Betw\u00e1, to the south, is rapid and unnavigable. The little river Non flows through the centre of the District, which it drains instead of watering, by innumerable small ravines. The District contains no lakes or jhils of importance, and no canals. It has no mineral wealth or forests. Woods which formerly existed along the river banks have been cleared, with the exception of the preserves of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of R\u00e1mpur and Gop\u00e1lpur, and the want of timber and even fuel is severely felt. As a whole, Jal\u00e1un is wanting in picturesqueness or beauty, but possesses great fertility and abundant agricultural resources, which, in the hands of a more enterprising and intelligent peasantry, might be easily developed into wealth and prosperity. Unfortunately,\nhowever, the general poverty and apathy of Bundelkhand at present weigh heavily upon the District, and greatly retard its progress.\n\n**History.** \u2014 Before the Aryan immigration, the region now known as Jal\u00e1un appears to have been inhabited by Bhils; but its early history, after the Aryan conquest, is as mythical as the annals of other Indian countries. The first period concerning which anything can be stated with certainty is that of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 dynasty, which lasted from the 1st to the 3rd century of the Christian era. A short account of their rule has been given under the District of BANDA. After the dissolution of the Narw\u00e1r monarchy, a period of dynastic struggles appears to have succeeded, during which the principal families of Bundelkhand in later times first rose into prominence. The eastern portion of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 dominions fell under the power of the Chandelas; while the western Districts, including that of Jal\u00e1un, were ruled by a R\u00e1jput clan, the Kachhw\u00e1has. They seem to have held the greater portion of the District until the invasion of the Bundelas in the 14th century. But the town of K\u00e1lpi on the Jumna, the gate of the west, was conquered for the Musalm\u00e1n Princes of Ghor by Kutab-ud-d\u00edn as early as the year 1196 A.D. It was guarded by a strong Muhammadan garrison, and became the head-quarters for the administration of all their territories beyond the Junna, and the starting-point for their expeditions both into Bengal and the Deccan. When, early in the 14th century, the Bundelas, a race of hardy mountaineers, poured down from their southern fastnesses upon the fertile plain of the Betw\u00e1 and the Pah\u00faj, they occupied the greater part of Jal\u00e1un, and even succeeded for a short time in holding the fortified post of K\u00e1lpi. That important possession, however, was soon recovered by the Musalm\u00e1ns, and passed with the rest of their territories under the sway of the Mughal Emperors.\n\nAkbar's governors at K\u00e1lpi maintained a nominal authority over the surrounding country; but the Bundela R\u00e1j\u00e1s in the south were practically independent of the Court of Delhi. Under Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr and Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, the native princes were in a state of chronic revolt, which culminated in the war of independence under Chhatar S\u00e1l. On the outbreak of his rebellion in 1671, he occupied a large Province to the south of the Jumna, including the modern District of Jal\u00e1un. Setting out from this base, he reduced the whole of Bundelkhand, in which task he was assisted by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, then for the first time overrunning Central India under their earliest Peshw\u00e1, B\u00e1ji R\u00e1o. Chhatar S\u00e1l died in 1734, and left by his will one-third of his dominions to his Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 ally, on condition that his descendants should be maintained in the remainder. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s displayed their usual alacrity in occupying the territory thus bequeathed them, and in making such additions as from time to time seemed practicable. Their governor\nhad his head-quarters at the important strategic post of K\u00e1lpi; and before long succeeded in quietly annexing the whole of Bundelkhand.\n\nUnder Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule, the country was a prey to constant anarchy and intestine strife. The hills in the region south of the Betwa were crowned by the mud forts of robber chiefs, who swooped down upon the fertile plains, and left nothing to the miserable cultivators beyond the barest necessaries of life. To this period must be traced the origin of all the poverty and desolation which still, after nearly forty years of British rule, are conspicuous throughout the District. Our first connection with Jal\u00e1un arose from the treaty of Bassein in 1802. By that arrangement, the Peshw\u00e1 agreed to cede certain portions of territory for the support of a British force. In order to carry out these terms, a supplementary arrangement was made with R\u00e1j\u00e1 Himmat Bah\u00e1dur, by which his aid was purchased in exchange for a cession of lands. (See BANDA DISTRICT.) K\u00e1lpi and the surrounding country were included in this grant. Himmat Bah\u00e1dur, however, died in 1804; and the pargand\u00e1 of K\u00e1lpi was thereupon handed over by the British to N\u00e1n\u00e1 Govind R\u00e1o, who was in possession of the rest of the District. He had assisted Shamsher Bah\u00e1dur, the Naw\u00e1b of B\u00e1nda, in his opposition to the British occupation; but, after two years, he submitted to the new rulers, and was restored to all his possessions.\n\nIn 1806, K\u00e1lpi was finally made over to the British, in exchange for certain villages, and formed part of the extensive District of Bundelkhand. The remainder of Jal\u00e1un was left in the hands of Govind R\u00e1o, and after his death passed to his son, and ultimately to his son\u2019s widow, a girl of only fourteen years. During the minority of her brother, whom she was permitted to adopt, the Jal\u00e1un State became wretchedly impoverished, and only yielded in 1838 one-fourth of the revenue which it was estimated to produce in 1803. The country fell almost into a wilderness, and many villages were entirely depopulated by emigration. But the boy chief died without issue in 1840, and his territories lapsed to the British Government. In the following year, Chirg\u00e1on, a neighbouring Native State, was annexed, owing to the rebellion of its chief. In 1844, three other pargand\u00e1s were ceded by Sindhia for the support of the Gwalior Contingent. At various later dates, portions of Jal\u00e1un were made over to Ham\u00edrpur, Jh\u00e1nsi, and other surrounding Districts; and in 1856, the present boundaries were substantially settled. During the period of British rule before the Mutiny, Jal\u00e1un, like other portions of Bundelkhand, recovered its prosperity only by very slow degrees. The zamind\u00e1rs had been left heavily in debt, and almost ruined, by the government of Govind R\u00e1o; and the assessments made at the various subsequent settlements followed, perhaps, too closely the native system. Property was so greatly depreciated, that in some cases no purchasers could be found for\nestates which had lapsed to the Government. This state of things continued down to the outbreak of the Mutiny in the spring of 1857.\n\nNews of the rising at Cawnpur reached K\u00e1lpi early in June; and shortly afterwards, intelligence arrived that the Europeans at Jh\u00e1nsi had been massacred. Thereupon the men of the 53rd Native Infantry deserted their officers; and on the 15th of June, the Jh\u00e1nsi mutineers reached the District, and murdered all the Europeans on whom they could lay their hands. Meanwhile, the G\u00farsar\u00e1i chief, Kesho R\u00e1o, adopted a wavering policy, and assumed supreme authority in the District,\u2014at first on the ground that it had been entrusted to him by the Deputy Commissioner, but afterwards on his own responsibility. He kept a few European officers as prisoners for some months, until after the defeat of the infamous N\u00e1n\u00e1 S\u00e1hib and his flight from Cawnpur; but those events induced him to change his tone, and to treat with General Neil for their restoration. After sending them in safety to Cawnpur, the chief established himself for a time at Jal\u00e1un; but upon the arrival of T\u00e1ntia Top\u00ed in October, the usual anarchic quarrels arose. Kesho R\u00e1o was deposed; his son was seized by the rebels; and the mutineers of Jal\u00e1un, joining those of Gwalior, set out for Cawnpur. Meanwhile, the natives everywhere revelled in the licence of plunder and murder which the Mutiny had spread through all Bundelkhand. In May 1858, after the fall of Jh\u00e1nsi, Sir Hugh Rose\u2019s force entered the District, and routed the rebels at K\u00fanch. There he left some troops of the G\u00farsar\u00e1i chief, whose allegiance had returned with the advent of the British forces. A Deputy Commissioner was put in charge of the District at K\u00fanch, and Sir Hugh Rose advanced to attack the strong rebel position at K\u00e1lpi. On the 23rd May, he drove them from that post, and shortly afterwards marched in pursuit towards Gwalior. Unfortunately he was unable to leave any troops in garrison, except a small body to guard the passage at K\u00e1lpi; and accordingly, on his withdrawal, the western portion of the District fell once more into anarchy. Plundering went on as before; and in July and August, the rebels again attacked and pillaged K\u00fanch and Jal\u00e1un. The latter town was immediately recovered by a detachment from the garrison at K\u00e1lpi; but it was not till September that the guerilla leaders were defeated, and some further time elapsed before the work of reorganization could be effected. Since the Mutiny, the condition of Jal\u00e1un appears to have been steadily, if very slowly, improving; and it is hoped that the more lenient fiscal arrangements of the present day will conduce to the prosperity of this still backward region.\n\nPeople.\u2014All enumerations of the population previous to 1865 were so imperfect as to be practically useless, even if they were not rendered unavailable for purposes of comparison by great differences in the area of the District. The Census of 1865 showed the total number of\ninhabitants to be 405,604. In 1872, the population had decreased to 404,447, being a falling off of 3 per cent., the decrease being due to deaths from famine and emigration, particularly in 1869. By 1881 the population had recovered itself, and was returned at 418,142, showing an increase of 13,695, or 3.4 per cent., in the nine years since 1872. The general results arrived at by the Census of 1881 may be summarized as under:\u2014Area of the District, 1469 square miles; number of towns and villages, 857; number of houses, 66,734; persons per square mile, 284.5; inhabited villages per square mile, 0.58; houses per square mile, 45.4; persons per village, 488; persons per house, 6.2. Classified according to sex, there were 216,145 males and 201,997 females; proportion of males, 52 per cent. Classified according to age, there were, under 15 years\u2014males 80,555, and females 70,260; total children, 150,815, or 36.07 per cent.; 15 years and upwards\u2014males 135,599, and females 131,737; total adults, 267,327, or 63.93 per cent. About 89 per cent. of the inhabitants belong to the rural, and 11 per cent. to the urban, population. As regards religion, Hindus numbered 392,332, or 93.8 per cent. of the total population; Muhammadans, 25,666, or 6.0 per cent.; Jains, 130; and Christians, 14.\n\nThe principal landowning tribes are\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, numbering 53,887; K\u00e1yasths, 8790; K\u00farm\u00eds, 18,473; G\u00fajars, 6583; and the Kachhw\u00e1has and Sengars, whose numbers are not returned separately in the Census Report. The Kachhw\u00e1has, who are R\u00e1jputs, are the leading clan of the District, and comprise most of the great native families. The Sengars, a clan originally Br\u00e1hman, which has intermarried with R\u00e1jputs, and is now ranked amongst them, are also numerous and influential; during the Mutiny they were conspicuous as plunderers. Total R\u00e1jputs, 40,733. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 pandits, who formed part of the governing body till 1840, are few in number, but wealthy; in 1857 they were almost unanimously rebellious. Many of them have since emigrated to Gwalior or to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 country. The other most numerous Hindu castes in the District are the following:\u2014Baniy\u00e1s, 16,464; Ah\u00edrs, 13,639; Cham\u00e1rs, 60,232; Gad\u00e1rias, 12,121; Kachh\u00eds, 28,418; Kor\u00eds, 21,164; and Lodhis, 12,305. The Musalm\u00e1ns have no social or political importance, and in sect they are almost exclusively Sunnis. There is no native Christian settlement, nor has the Br\u00e1hma Sam\u00e1j made any progress in the District.\n\nAs regards occupations, the Census Report returns the male population under six classes:\u2014(1) Professional, including Government officials and the learned professions, 5216; (2) domestic servants, board and lodging-house keepers, 1433; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 3780; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 84,294; (5) manufacturing and industrial\nclass, 31,498; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, including general labourers, male children, etc., 89,924. There were four towns in 1881 with a population exceeding 5000, namely, Kalpi, 14,306; Kunch, 13,739; Jalaun, 10,057; and Urai, 7738. Of minor villages and towns, 336 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 275 between two hundred and five hundred; 151 between five hundred and a thousand; 71 between one thousand and two thousand; and 20 between two thousand and five thousand inhabitants. The language in common use is a dialect of Hindi, but a corrupt form of Urdu is spoken in the Muhammadan villages.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The staple crops of the District are cereals, gram, and cotton. Of these, gram occupies the largest area; and next in point of acreage come wheat, and the two millets known as jo\u00e1r and bajra. Cotton was very extensively cultivated during the scarcity caused by the American war; and although the total out-turn is now only one-tenth of that produced in 1864, it still ranks fifth of all crops grown in Jal\u00e1un. About 5 l\u00f3khs worth (say \u00a350,000) is exported annually. Oil-seeds, dye-stuffs, and sugar-cane are also raised, but in no large quantities. The seasons are those prevalent throughout Bundelkhand,\u2014the kharif or autumn crops, sown in June or August, consist chiefly of millets and cotton; the rabi or spring crops, sown in November or December, are mainly gram and wheat. Of the total area of 1477 square miles in 1881, 952 square miles were returned as under cultivation, 215 as cultivable, 259 as uncultivable, and the remainder as revenue-free and non-assessed. This is exclusive of 85 square miles comprising the three semi-independent chiefships of R\u00e1mpur\u00e1, Jagamanpur, and Gop\u00e1lpur, concerning which no details are available, and which pay no tribute or revenue to Government. The kharif or autumn food crop in 1881 was grown over an area of 182,548 acres, and non-food crops over 70,533 acres. The rabi or spring harvest area was returned at 370,384 acres of food crops, and 5501 acres of non-food crops. Total kharif and rabi area, including land twice cropped, 629,966 acres. The cultivation of the al plant (Morinda citrifolia) holds a prominent place in the District, and the dyeing of cloths therefrom is the staple industry of the towns of Kunch, Kalpi, Sayyidnagar, and Kotra. The total produce of grain is estimated at 2,987,292 maunds, or 2,194,745 cwts., of which 2,313,210 maunds are required for home consumption, leaving 674,081 maunds, or 495,241 cwts., valued at \u00a3134,816, for export.\n\nRotation of crops is practised to a slight extent, and exhausting staples are sown only after a long rest. Manuring is not resorted to, except in the case of sugar-cane and other expensive produce. The practice is, however, on the increase. Irrigation was employed in 1881 over 18,889 acres. Of this area, 7719 acres, situated in pargan\u00e1 Kunch to\nthe south of the District, are watered by the natural channel known as the *pau*, which flows from the uplands in the Native State of Samthar. The remainder is artificially irrigated from wells; only an insignificant fraction being supplied from tanks. A scheme is (1883) in progress, however, for damming up the Betw\u00e1, and distributing abundant irrigation by means of canals. Jal\u00e1un has suffered at times, like the surrounding Districts, from the noxious *k\u00e1ns* grass. The condition of the peasantry is still far from comfortable; their houses and villages are squalid, and the usual apathetic poverty of Bundelkhand is noticeable in their dress and surroundings. Both *zamind\u00e1rs* and cultivators are generally deeply in debt to the village banker; and they have learned to look upon such indebtedness as the normal economical state.\n\nAbout one-half of the land is held by cultivators possessing rights of occupancy. A holding of 90 acres is considered large; one of 20 to 25 acres, a fair middle-sized farm. The adult male agricultural population in 1881 was returned at 83,991, namely, landholders, 8960; estate agents, 719; cultivators, 57,961; and field labourers, 15,933. The adult female agriculturists numbered 35,844, namely, landholders, 1819; cultivators, 26,612; and field labourers, 7413. Total amount of Government assessment, including local rates and cesses levied on the land, \u00a3108,643, or 3s. 6\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total rental, including cesses, etc., paid by the cultivators, \u00a3206,815, or 6s. 7d. per cultivated acre. Rents run from 2s. 7d. to 7s. 6d. per acre, according to the nature of the soil and the caste of the tenant, the lower castes, such as Kurmis and Kachhis, paying more than Bundelas and Rajputs for lands of the same quality. The average rate on all classes of land is 5s. 4\u00bdd. per acre. Profits are hoarded, or spent in jewellery for the women; nothing is employed as capital in land improvements or investment. Wages have risen much of late years; the chief causes being the rise in price of food-stuffs, the increased demand for labour on the railways, and the cessation of the former stream of immigrants from Oudh, whose people now find employment and security under British rule in their own country. These various influences have produced a rise of 25 per cent. during the last ten years. The average wages of tailors are now about 7\u00bdd. per diem; carpenters, blacksmiths, head masons, 6d. per diem; common masons, road-makers, 3d. to 4\u00bdd.; boys, 2\u00bdd.; women and children, \u00bed. to 1\u00bdd. Agricultural wages are paid to a great extent in kind. The average prices of the chief food-grains in 1882\u201383 (in Jal\u00e1un *pargan\u00e1*) were as follows:\u2014Gram, 29 *sers* the rupee, or 3s. 10d. per cwt.; *jo\u00e1r*, 28 *sers* the rupee, or 4s. per cwt.; wheat, 21 *sers* the rupee, or 5s. 4d. per cwt.; common rice, 14 *sers* per rupee, or 8s. per cwt.\n\n*Natural Calamities.*\u2014Drought is the great danger to be apprehended\nin Jal\u00e1un. Famine or scarcity from that cause occurred in 1783, in 1833, in 1837, and in 1848. The last important drought was that in August and September of 1868. Two-thirds of the autumn, and one-half of the cold-weather, crops were then destroyed. No actual famine resulted, but great distress prevailed, especially in the remote southern villages, until the summer of 1869. The surplus grain of the Do\u00e1b passed through K\u00e1lpi southward and westward in large quantities. At Ur\u00e1i, rations of 1 lb. per adult and \u00bd lb. per child were distributed by Government. Large numbers were also assisted by private charity at K\u00e1lpi. In the south, relief works were opened in the shape of road-making and excavation of tanks. The total cost of the relief operations amounted to \u00a31864, and the average number of persons daily relieved was 1800. The maximum price of gram during the scarcity was 9 sers 3 chhat\u00e1ks the rupee, or about 12s. 2\u00bdd. per cwt.\n\nJal\u00e1un is more favourably situated for communication with the Do\u00e1b, via K\u00e1lpi and Shergarhgh\u00e1t, than any other District of the Jh\u00e1nsi Division; but even here the agricultural population suffered much hardship in 1868, and lost one-third of their cattle. It was necessary to suspend the collection of a large portion of the revenue; but no advances were needed for the purpose of buying seed, as was the case in neighbouring Districts to the south.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014Jal\u00e1un is almost entirely an agricultural District, and its chief exports are cotton and grain. K\u00e1lpi is the great mart of the District, through which traffic passes north-westward by Cawnpur, and south-eastward toward M\u00edrzapur and Calcutta. K\u00fanch is also a considerable trading town. The business of the outlying villages is chiefly conducted at fairs, where English cloth and other European goods are beginning to make their appearance. There are scarcely any manufactures of sufficient importance to deserve record. Coarse cotton cloth is woven for home use; and the dyeing of such fabrics with the red al dye, obtained from the root of Morinda citrifolia grown in the District, is the staple industry of the principal towns. No mines or forests exist in Jal\u00e1un. The communications are moderately good. The river traffic by K\u00e1lpi is chiefly for through goods; and the Jumna is little used as a highway. The nearest railway station is at Phaph\u00fand on the East Indian line, in Et\u00e1wah District, which is connected with the towns of Ur\u00e1i and Jal\u00e1un by a good commercial road, crossing the river at Shergarh. There is also a great military road from K\u00e1lpi to Jh\u00e1nsi, metalled throughout. Total length of roads, 534\u00bd miles. In times of flood, however, the Betw\u00e1 and the Pah\u00faj are often impassable for days.\n\nAdministration.\u2014It is almost impossible to give any intelligible account of the fiscal history of this District within reasonable limits, owing to the frequent changes, transfers, and redistribution of villages\nand parganas made with the surrounding Districts and Native States. When Jal\u00e1un was first taken over by the British Government from the family of Govind R\u00e1o, the last chief, who died without heirs in 1840, it was already greatly impoverished by their misgovern- ment. The existing assessments were found to be too high, and successive reductions became necessary from time to time. After the Mutiny, a lighter settlement was introduced, which seems to be working beneficially for the restoration of agricultural prosperity. The revenue in 1860 amounted to \u00a3128,026, and the expenditure to \u00a347,601, or rather more than one-third of the revenue. In 1870, the receipts had fallen to \u00a3112,128, and the expenditure to \u00a324,813, or rather more than one-fifth of the revenue. The immense difference in the expenditure at these two dates, amounting to a decrease of nearly one-half, is chiefly due to the great retrenchment in the items of justice, police, and public works. In 1882\u201383, the total revenue of Jal\u00e1un was \u00a3120,624, of which \u00a390,942, or 75\u00b739 per cent., was derived from the land-tax. The other principal items are excise, stamps, and fees in courts of justice.\n\nThe administration is on the non-regulation system, which unites civil, criminal, and fiscal functions in the same officer. The District is administered by 1 Deputy Commissioner, 2 Assistant Commissioners, 3 extra-Assistant Commissioners, and 5 tahsildars. It contains 25 police stations. The regular and municipal police in 1882 numbered 573 men, maintained at a cost of \u00a35818, of which \u00a35018 was paid from imperial revenues. There were also 1237 village watchmen, paid at the rate of 3 rupees a month. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property, consisted in 1882 of 1810 men, giving 1 man to every 0\u00b781 square mile of the area and to every 231 of the population. The statistics of crime in the same year were as follows:\u2014Murder, 6 cases; robbery, 3; house-trespass, 224; theft, 759; cattle theft, 64. There is 1 jail in the District, the average daily number of prisoners in which was 114 in 1882. Education has been progressing slowly of late years. In 1860 there were 1434 children under instruction in Government-inspected schools; in 1871, the number had increased to 2703; in 1882\u201383, the Government schools were returned at 98, with 2597 pupils. This, however, is exclusive of private and uninspected indigenous schools; and the Census of 1881 returned 4013 boys and 28 girls as under instruction, besides 13,761 males and 86 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The District is divided into 5 fiscal divisions, with an aggregate in 1882 of 1294 estates, the average land revenue from each being \u00a370, 10s. The District contains 3 municipalities\u2014Ur\u00e1i, K\u00e1lpi, and K\u00fanch, with a total municipal population of 35,797. In 1882\u201383, their aggregate revenue amounted to \u00a32182, of which\n\u00a31759 was derived from octroi, or an average taxation of 1s. per head; expenditure, \u00a32238.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Jal\u00e1un, though hot and dry, is not considered unhealthy. The mean temperature is about 81\u00b0 F. for the whole year; the monthly averages being as follows:\u2014January, 65\u00b0; February, 75\u00b0; March, 80\u00b0; April, 90\u00b0; May, 96\u00b0; June, 95\u00b0; July, 90\u00b0; August, 87\u00b0; September, 86\u00b0; October, 82\u00b0; November, 68\u00b0; and December, 66\u00b0. The rainfall for the ten years preceding 1881 was as follows:\u20141871-72, 43 inches; 1872-73, 28.8 inches; 1873-74, 31.4 inches; 1874-75, 43.6 inches; 1875-76, 35.5 inches; 1876-77, 32.18 inches; 1877-78, 15.4 inches; 1878-79, 20.4 inches; 1879-80, 33 inches; and 1880-81, 15 inches. Annual average for the 10 years, 29.82 inches.\n\nThe prevailing diseases of Jal\u00e1un are fevers, dysentery, and other bowel complaints. The total number of deaths recorded in 1881 was 16,074, being at the rate of 38.40 per thousand, of which 24.41 per thousand were assigned to fevers. The endemic diseases are chiefly attributable to bad drainage, impure water, and dirty habits. The want of shade not only induces a dry and hot atmosphere, but is also answerable for much sickness. Rinderpest broke out in the District in 1870, but was repressed by a rigorous system of segregation and quarantine before it had caused any serious loss. [For further information regarding Jal\u00e1un, see Settlement Report of the District, by Colonel Ternan, Mr. E. White, C.S., and Colonel Lloyd, dated 1870; the Gazetteer of the North-Western Provinces, by Mr. E. T. Atkinson, C.S. (vol. i., Government Press, Allahabad, 1874); the Census Report of the North-Western Provinces for 1881; and the Provincial and Departmental Administration Reports from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nJal\u00e1un.\u2014Central northern tahsil of Jal\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces, consisting of a level plain, stretching inward from the southern bank of the Jumna, and conterminous with Jal\u00e1un pargana. Area, 323 square miles, of which 242 are cultivated. Population (1872) 91,501; (1881) 94,873, namely, males 40,098, and females 45,775. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 89,404; and Muhammadans, 5469. Of the 231 villages comprising the tahsil, 170 contained less than five hundred inhabitants; 40 from five hundred to a thousand; 18 from one to two thousand; and 3 upwards of two thousand. Land revenue, \u00a322,226; total Government revenue, \u00a325,067; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a350,975; incidence of Government revenue per acre, 2s. 5d. In 1884, the tahsil contained 2 civil and 2 criminal courts, with 3 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s). Strength of regular police, 41 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 330.\n\nJal\u00e1un.\u2014Town in Jal\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces, and former capital of a Native State. Lat. 26\u00b0 8' 32\" N., long. 79\u00b0 22' 42\" E.\nThe town occupies a large area, and contains a considerable number of good houses, and a ruined fort, demolished in 1860, the former residence of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 governors. The principal inhabitants are Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Br\u00e1hmans, known as Dakhin\u00ed Pandits, whose ancestors held offices under the Peshw\u00e1's deputy. The position of the town is low, and surrounding swamps engender cholera and malarious fever, for which reason the head-quarters of the District have been fixed at Ural, instead of in this place. Population (1881) 10,057, namely, Hindus, 8,604, and Muhammadans, 1,453. Tuhili, police station, dispensary, school. A good new b\u00e1z\u00e1r known as Whiteganj has recently been constructed on the extensive open site of the old fort, at a cost of \u00a35,000. No manufactures, little trade. A good road runs to Shergarh ferry on the Jumna, 14 miles from Phaphund station on the East Indian Railway.\n\nJ\u00e1ladhak\u00e1.\u2014River of Northern Bengal, rising in the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Hills. It flows from north to south, marking the boundary between the British District of D\u00e1rj\u00edling and the State of Bh\u00fat\u00e1n; passes through Jalp\u00e1gur\u00ed District; sweeps eastward into Kuch Behar, and, after a southeasterly course, joins the Dharla or Torsha River, with which it has several cross communications, near the trading villages of Durg\u00e1pur and Gitaldaha in that State. In the upper part of its course, the J\u00e1ladhak\u00e1 is called the De-chu; its principal tributaries in D\u00e1rj\u00edling District being the Par\u00e1lang-chu, Rang-chu, and Ma-chu, all on its right bank. In the lower part of its course, the J\u00e1ladhak\u00e1 is known as the Singim\u00e1ri; its chief affluents in Jalp\u00e1gur\u00ed are the Murt\u00ed and the Dina,\u2014in Kuch Behar, the Mujn\u00e1i, Satanga, Duduy\u00e1, Dolang, and D\u00e1lkho\u00e1. The J\u00e1ladhak\u00e1 is a wide river, but very shallow.\n\nJalesar.\u2014North-eastern tahsil of Etah District, North-Western Provinces, lying in the Do\u00e1b plain, but much intersected by ravines along the banks of the Isan N\u00e1di. The tahsil was recently transferred to Etah from Agra District. Area, 227 square miles, of which 152 are cultivated. Population in 1872, 125,591; in 1881, 118,925, namely, males 64,672, and females 54,253. In 1881, Hindus numbered 103,487; Muhammadans, 13,135; Jains, 2,295; 'others,' 8. Number of towns and villages, 158. Land revenue, \u00a327,531; total Government revenue, \u00a337,015; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a356,661.\n\nJalesar.\u2014Town and municipality in Etah District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Jalesar tahsil. Lat. 27\u00b0 28' N., long. 78\u00b0 20' 30\" E. Situated on the Do\u00e1b plain, 38 miles east of the Jumna and of Muttra. Station on the East Indian Railway, at Jalesar road. Population (1881) 15,609, namely, Hindus, 9,371; Muhammadans, 5,998; Jains, 239; Christian, 1. Area of town site, 222 acres. Municipal revenue in 1882-83, \u00a3974; from taxes, \u00a3871, or 1s. 1\u00bdd. per head of population.\nJaleswar (popularly Jellasore).\u2014An old border town between Bengal and Orissa, now within the north-east boundary of Balasor District; situated in lat. $21^\\circ 47' 20''$ N., and long. $87^\\circ 13' 35''$ E., on the Calcutta high-road. The name is also applied to an ancient Muhammadan circle or sarkar, which comprised the present Midnapur District, including Hijili. During the last century, the East India Company had a factory at Jaleswar, and established some sort of order along the neighbouring frontier. On the abolition of the Company\u2019s factory, the town ceased to have any external importance as a seat of trade.\n\nJalg\u00e1on.\u2014Town and municipality in the Nas\u00edr\u00e1bd\u00e1d (Nusseer\u00e1b\u00e1d) Sub-division, Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency; station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 261 miles north-east of Bombay. Lat. $20^\\circ 25'$ N., long. $74^\\circ 33'$ E. Population (1872) 6893; (1881) 9918, namely, Hindus, 8234; Muhammadans, 1297; Jains, 269; Christians, 28; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 3; and \u2018others,\u2019 87. Municipal income (1882\u201383), \u00a32968; municipal expenditure, \u00a32819; rate of taxation, 4s. 1\u00bdd. per head of the population (9882) within municipal limits. Area of town site, 417 acres. Seat of an assistant superintendent of police, of the revenue authorities of the Sub-division, and of a sub-judge\u2019s court. The railway was opened in 1860. Situated in the centre of a rich cotton-growing district, Jalg\u00e1on has during the last fifty years risen to the position of an important mercantile town. During the American war (1862\u201365), the town was the great cotton mart of Kh\u00e1ndesh. It suffered severely from the fall in the value of products at the close of the war, but its trade is steadily recovering. The chief articles of commerce are cotton, linseed, and sesamum. There were at Jalg\u00e1on in 1882 three full-power cotton-presses, one large cotton ginning factory, and one cotton spinning and weaving mill, all worked by steam. In the same year, the number of looms was 220, and of spindles, 19,000. The Bombay Bank has a branch, and sends an agent during the busy season (November\u2013May). The town has been greatly improved of late years. A new suburb, Pollen Pet, has been built; a market-place laid regularly out; and a new school and dispensary erected. There are also a travellers\u2019 bungalow, post-office, m\u00e1mlatdd\u00e1r\u2019s court, native rest-house, police station, and municipal office. The municipality has laid out a garden on the site of part of the old cotton market. One of the most striking of many handsome buildings in the new suburb is a three-storied dwelling built by the p\u00e1tel or head-man of Pathri. Water is carried through iron pipes from the Mehrun lake, two miles distant. A good road joins Jalg\u00e1on and the railway station. There is also a metalled road between Jalg\u00e1on and Neri, 14 miles distant.\n\nJalg\u00e1on.\u2014Village in Arvi tahsil, Wardh\u00e1 District, Central Provinces,\n6 miles north-west of Arvi, and 40 from Wardh\u00e1 town. Population (1881) 2121, chiefly agriculturists. Hindus numbered 1991; Muhammadans, 110; Jains, 14; aborigines, 6. Fine p\u00e1n and other gardens; 90 wells. Bi-weekly market; school.\n\n**Jalg\u00e1on.\u2014T\u00e1luk of Akola District, Ber\u00e1r.** Lat. 20\u00b0 16' 45\" to 21\u00b0 16' 45\" N., long. 76\u00b0 25' to 77\u00b0 26' E. Area, 392 square miles; contains 3 towns and 162 villages, with 19,428 houses. Population (1867) 83,110; (1881) 105,739, namely, 54,434 males and 51,305 females; average density, 269'74 persons per square mile. Total increase (1867 to 1881), 22,629, or 27'23 per cent. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 98,071; Muhammadans, 7521; Sikhs, 40; Jains, 100; and P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 7. Agriculturists numbered 77,152, or 72'9 per cent. of the total population of the t\u00e1luk, the average area of cultivated and cultivable land being 2'86 acres per head of the agricultural population. Of the total area of 392 square miles, 360 square miles were assessed for Government revenue in 1881, of which 310'5 square miles were returned as under cultivation; 16'2 square miles as cultivable; and 33'2 square miles as uncultivable waste. Total Government land revenue, including local rates and cesses levied on the land, \u00a333,218, or an average of 3s. 4d. per cultivated acre. The t\u00e1luk is crossed by the N\u00e1gpur Branch of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway; Jalam junction (with branch to Khamg\u00e1on), Sheg\u00e1on, Paras, Dapki, Akola, and Borg\u00e1on stations, are situated in it. The t\u00e1luk contains 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 2; regular police, 47 men; village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 176.\n\n**Jalg\u00e1on.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of Barw\u00e1n\u00ed State, Deputy Bh\u00edl (M\u00e1npur) Agency, Central India.** Area, 672 square miles, of which 11,334 acres are cultivated, 105,500 acres cultivable, and the remainder barren and hilly.

Khetia and Melan are the two largest villages in the pargan\u00e1.\n\n**Jalg\u00e1on-Jambod.\u2014Town in Akola District, Ber\u00e1r; called Jalg\u00e1on-Jambod, from an adjacent village, to distinguish it from Jalg\u00e1on in Kh\u00e1n-desh.** Lat. 21\u00b0 3' N., long. 76\u00b0 35' E.; situated 44 miles north-west of Akola town, 8 miles south of the S\u00e1tpura Hills, and 6 miles from the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, the nearest station being at N\u00e1nd\u00fara, in Buld\u00e1n\u00e1 District. Population (1867) 8763; (1881) 10,392, namely, 5267 males and 5125 females. Of the total population, 8649 were returned as Hindus; 1715 Muhammadans; 10 Sikhs; 11 Jains; and 7 P\u00e1rs\u00eds. Area of town site, 142 acres. A pass over the hills north of the town leads to As\u00edrgarh and Burh\u00e1npur, but is nearly impracticable even for pack-bullocks. On the crest of the hills, between Jalg\u00e1on and Burh\u00e1npur, and commanding the road, is the village of Bing\u00e1ra, inhabited by Muhammadan Bh\u00edls. The\nonly water procurable in these hills for many miles is supplied by a tank near Bing\u00e1ra. Jalga\u00f3n is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbar\u00ed as the head-quarters of a pargan\u00e1. Spring water is abundant. In many large gardens, principally on the western side of the town, grapes, plantains, and betel creepers are grown. Weekly market. Average import of cotton, 5000 bullock-loads, of about 260 lbs. each. The town contains an extra-Assistant Commissioner's court, the usual tahsil buildings, a middle-class school, police station, charitable dispensary, and post-office.\n\nJ\u00e1l\u00eda Amr\u00e1j\u00ed.\u2014Petty State, Undsarviya District, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; situated about 9 miles south-west of P\u00e1lit\u00e1na. J\u00e1l\u00eda Amr\u00e1j\u00ed consists of 1 village, with 1 independent tribute-payer. Population (1881) 608. The t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs are Sarviy\u00e1 R\u00e1jputs. The revenue is estimated at \u00a3220; tribute of \u00a312, 16s. is paid to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and 16s. to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\nJ\u00e1l\u00eda Dew\u00e1n\u00ed.\u2014Petty State in H\u00e1l\u00e1r District, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. J\u00e1l\u00eda Dew\u00e1n\u00ed consists of 10 villages, with 1 independent tribute-payer. The revenue is estimated at \u00a31300; tribute of \u00a3118, 3s. is paid to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and \u00a337 to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh.\n\nJ\u00e1l\u00eda Man\u00e1ji.\u2014Petty State, Undsarviya District, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. J\u00e1l\u00eda Man\u00e1ji consists of 1 village, with 1 independent tribute-payer. Population (1881) 180. The revenue is estimated at \u00a3200; tribute of \u00a33, 2s. is paid to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda.\n\nJ\u00e1lna.\u2014Town and cantonment in Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) State (Nizam's Dominions), Southern India. Lat. 19\u00b0 50' 30\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 56' E.; lies on the right bank of the Kundalika stream, opposite the town of K\u00e1dir\u00e1b\u00e1d, and 240 miles north-west of Sikandar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Secunder\u00e1b\u00e1d), 38 miles east of Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d, and 210 miles north-east of Bombay. Population (1881) 6258. A British cantonment, occupied by a regiment of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d Contingent, is situated on a gentle declivity to the east of the town, at an elevation of 1652 feet above the sea, in an arid tract of country. Population (1881) 9933. The lines, built in 1827, extend from south-east to north-west, and can accommodate a troop of horse artillery, one regiment of Native cavalry, and three regiments of Native infantry. Sita, wife of R\u00e1ma, is said to have resided anciently at J\u00e1lna, then called Jankapur. In the time of Akbar, J\u00e1lna was held as a j\u00e1g\u00edr by one of the Mughal generals. Abu-l-Fazl, the Muhammadan historian, dwelt in the town when exiled from Akbar's court. During the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 war in 1803, British troops under Colonel Stevenson occupied the place. The only public buildings of note are the s\u00e1rd\u00ed, a stone-built rest-house, and a mosque. There are 3 Hindu temples. Trade\nhas declined. The only manufactures carried on in J\u00e1lna now are those of cotton cloths, gold and silver lace. A fort, erected in 1725, now occupied by a tahsild\u00e1r's guard, stands in the east quarter of the town. In the fort is a remarkable well, the sides of which are excavated into galleries and chambers. The gardens of J\u00e1lna, to the north of the fort, are celebrated in the Dekhan, and the fruit is sent in large quantities to Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Bombay, and other distant places. Half a mile to the west of J\u00e1lna is the Mot\u00ed Tal\u00e1o, an immense tank, supplying the town with water. J\u00e1lna cantonment has a post-office, travellers' bungalow, and two churches, one of which belongs to the Free Church Mission, and has a school attached to it.\n\nJ\u00e1lor.\u2014Town in the Native State of Jodhpur or M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Lat. 25\u00b0 22\u2032 N., long. 72\u00b0 57\u2032 45\u2033 E. J\u00e1lor, situated on the southern border of the vast sandy plain of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, was founded early in the Christian era by the Pram\u00e1r\u00e1 dynasty. It is built of large masses of cut stone in a good state of preservation. The town is of considerable importance. Drinking vessels of bell-metal, prettily engraved, are made by Thatheras. The fort of J\u00e1lor is 800 yards long and 400 wide, and commands the town from an eminence of 1200 feet. The main entrance is on the northern face, and leads up a steep, slippery, stone roadway, passing three distinct lines of defence, all of considerable strength, and mounting guns on the outer face of the fort. There is but a single rampart wall, about 20 feet in height. In former ages it was famous for its strength, and the many gallant sieges it withstood. There are two tanks in the fort.\n\nJalori (or Suket).\u2014Mountain range in K\u00e1ngra District, Punjab; one of the minor Him\u00e1layan chains. It is an offshoot of the mid-Him\u00e1layan system, which traverses the Sub-division of Seor\u00e1j in K\u00falu, and throws off a lofty spur to the north, separated from the outer Him\u00e1layas or Dh\u00e1ola-dhar range by the deep gorge of the Bi\u00e1s (Beas). It forms the dividing ridge between the affluents of that river and the watershed of the Sutlej (Satl\u00e9j). The range is crossed by two roads, one, the Jalori Pass (height, 10,980 feet), leading towards Simla; the other, the Basleo (10,880 feet), towards R\u00e1mpur, in Bashahr State.\n\nJalp\u00e1igur\u00ed.\u2014The north-eastern District of the R\u00e1jsh\u00e1h\u00ed Kuch Behar Division, in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal. It lies between 26\u00b0 0\u2032 35\u2033 and 26\u00b0 59\u2032 30\u2033 N. lat., and between 88\u00b0 22\u2032 40\u2033 and 89\u00b0 55\u2032 20\u2033 E. long., occupying an irregularly shaped tract south of Bh\u00fat\u00e1n and north of the State of Kuch Behar and Rangpur District. Area, 2884 square miles. Population (1881) 581,562 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at Jalpaiguri town, which is also a military station.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014From a geographical point of view, as well as for administrative purposes, the District is divided into two distinct parts\u2014\nthe Regulation tract, lying towards the south-west, which originally formed portion of the permanently settled District of Rangpur; and the strip of country, about 22 miles in width, running along the foot of the Him\u00e1layas, which was annexed from Bh\u00fat\u00e1n in 1865, and is known as the Western Dw\u00e1rs. The former of these tracts resembles in most respects the neighbouring Districts of Rangpur and Din\u00e1jpur. Its continuous expanse of level paddy fields is only broken by the groves of bamboos, palms, and fruit-trees, which encircle the homesteads of the joddars, or substantial tenant-farmers. There is but little waste land along the banks of the numerous small streams and water-courses which intersect this south-western portion of the District. With the exception of a few patches of tree jungle and brushwood, the only large tract of uncultivated country in the Regulation Division of the District is a valuable and extensive s\u00e1l forest, comprising an area of 50 or 60 square miles, the private property of the R\u00e1ikat of Baikunthpur.\n\nIn the other tract, comprising a part of the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Dw\u00e1rs, the scenery is very different. This tract, which was annexed at the close of the war of 1864-65, forms a flat, level strip of country, averaging about 22 miles in width, running along the foot of the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Hills. Its chief characteristics are the numerous rivers and hill streams which flow in every direction, and the large tracts of s\u00e1l forest and heavy grass and reed jungle, interspersed with wild cardamoms. These grass and reed tracts are especially dense and luxuriant along the banks of the rivers and streams, where they grow many feet in height; in some places they are impenetrable by man. Here the beautiful cotton tree (Bombax malabaricum) is to be found growing in great luxuriance and with surprising vigour and rapidity, resisting even the action of the fires by which the jungles and undergrowth are yearly consumed at the commencement of every cultivating season. With this single exception, these vast tracts of grassy jungle are almost treeless, and bring out into greater relief the village sites, situated few and far between. These little hamlets are remarkable for the most luxuriant vegetation. Large clumps of bamboos and groves of plantain trees hem them in on all sides, almost hiding the houses from view. Above them are seen the tall, graceful betel-nut palms, and here and there a few other large trees, such as mango, jack, and pipal; and round about the dwellings, in fact up to the very doorways, are shrubs and creeping plants of endless form and variety. Fine fields of rice and mustard are also found in the vicinity of the villages. The scenery in the north of the Dw\u00e1rs, along the foot of the mountains, where the large rivers debouch upon the plains, is very grand and beautiful, especially at the point where the Sankos river leaves the hills. In the neighbourhood of the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n range, for from five to ten miles before reaching\nthe hills, the land rises gradually. In this tract the soil is only from three to four feet deep, with a substratum of gravel and shingle; and in the dry season the beds of the streams for some miles after leaving the hills are dry, the water reappearing farther down.\n\nThe only mountainous tract in the District is that portion of the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n range in the immediate neighbourhood of the military outpost of Bax\u00e1, near the northern boundary line of the District, which is marked by the Sinchul\u00e1 Hills, a range varying from 4000 to a little over 6000 feet in height. Bax\u00e1, on one of the principal routes into Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, is itself situated on a lower range of hills varying from 1659 to 2457 feet in height.\n\nThe principal rivers in the District, proceeding from west to east, are the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1, Kar\u00e1t\u00f3y\u00e1, T\u00edst\u00e1, J\u00e1ldh\u00e1k\u00e1, Duduy\u00e1, Mujn\u00e1i, Torsh\u00e1, K\u00e1lj\u00e1n\u00ed, R\u00e1idhak, and Sankos\u2014all of which see separately. These rivers are nearly all navigable by boats of between 3 and 4 tons burden for a considerable portion of their course, but in the upper portion of the Dw\u00e1rs Sub-division, navigation is impeded by rapids; and, as already stated, owing to the porous nature of the soil near the hills, the beds of the rivers in this tract are without water in the dry season for some few miles after debouching upon the plains. The rivers all flow down from the hills in a southerly direction; they are constantly changing their main channels, and the country is everywhere seamed by deserted river beds.\n\nThe Government forest reserves in the Western Dw\u00e1rs Sub-division cover a total area of 428\u00bd square miles. In Jalp\u00e1iguri Sub-division, the only forest tract is a valuable private estate known as the Baikunthpur jungle, from which a considerable quantity of sal timber is floated down the T\u00edst\u00e1. The large area of pasturage in the Western Dw\u00e1rs affords grazing ground to immense herds of cattle and buffaloes which are annually driven up from Bengal. The only mineral of importance is limestone, which is largely quarried in the shape of calcareous tufa along the base of the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Hills. A small copper mine also exists near Bax\u00e1. The large game found in the District are wild elephants and mithun or wild cattle, found only close to the hills; and rhinoceroses, buffaloes, tigers, leopards, bears, wild hog, deer, etc. Among the smaller animals are fallow-deer, hog-deer, antelope, hares, foxes, porcupines, wild cats, jackals, and monkeys. The principal game birds are pea-fowl, floriken, wild ducks, teal, red and black partridges, quail, snipe, golden plover, etc. Fish abound in the rivers.\n\nHistory.\u2014The District of Jalp\u00e1iguri first came into existence in the year 1869, when the Tit\u00e1ly\u00e1 Sub-division of Rangpur was incorporated with the Western Dw\u00e1rs, and erected into an independent revenue unit. The criminal jurisdiction alone had been assigned to the Deputy Com-\nmissioner of the Western Dw\u00e1rs two years before; the civil jurisdiction was not finally transferred till 1870.\n\nThe permanently settled portion of Jalp\u00e1iguri has no history of its own, apart from that of the parent District of Rangpur. Its boundaries are perplexingly intermingled with those of the Native State of Kuch Behar, from which it was conquered by the Muhammadans in comparatively recent times. At the present day, by far the wealthiest landowners are the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kuch Behar himself, and the R\u00e1ikat of Baikunthpur, who is descended from a younger branch of the Kuch Behar family. This tract is administered in accordance with the ordinary Regulations and Acts in force throughout Bengal.\n\nThe Western Dw\u00e1rs became British territory as the result of the war with Bh\u00fat\u00e1n in 1864\u201365. That war had been provoked by the gross insults offered to a British ambassador by the Bhuti\u00e1 Government in 1863. As no apologies were offered, it was resolved forthwith to effect by force of arms the permanent annexation of the Dw\u00e1rs; by which step a command would be gained over the hill passes, and a race closely allied with the people of Bengal would be delivered from Bhuti\u00e1 anarchy. Accordingly, in December 1864, four strong military columns made a simultaneous advance, and occupied the Dw\u00e1rs and the hill posts above, after slight opposition. But in the beginning of 1865, the Bhuti\u00e1s recovered heart. They threatened in force the whole line of British outposts, and drove away the garrison at Diw\u00e1ngiri with the loss of two mountain guns. The abandoned post was speedily recovered; and before the close of the year, the Bhuti\u00e1s consented to accept the terms of peace which had been offered to them before the outbreak of hostilities, and, in addition, to surrender the two guns they had captured. By this treaty the Dw\u00e1rs were ceded in perpetuity to the British Government; and an annual allowance of \u00a32500 was granted to Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, which sum has now been increased to \u00a35000. Since that date our relations with Bh\u00fat\u00e1n have been peaceful, and the frontier raids, which were previously of common occurrence, have altogether ceased.\n\nThe newly-acquired territory was immediately formed into the two Districts of the Eastern and Western Dw\u00e1rs, of which the former has been since incorporated with the Assam District of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1. In 1867, the D\u00e1l\u00edngkot Sub-division of the Western Dw\u00e1rs, which lies high up among the mountains, was annexed to D\u00e1rj\u00edling; and the remainder, as already mentioned, was formed into the new District of Jalp\u00e1iguri, with the addition of a portion taken from the unwieldy jurisdiction of Rangpur. The Dw\u00e1rs are still administered in a provisional manner, being reckoned as a non-Regulation tract. The entire soil is held kh\u00e1s, or under direct Government management, temporary settlements being made with the actual cultivators; and a large portion has been reserved\nby the Forest Department. Great tenderness has been shown in all dealings with the aboriginal population. A careful record was made of all rights and interests in the land at the time of the settlement in 1870, when an enumeration of the people and houses was also conducted. Cultivation is now rapidly extending through the Dw\u00e1rs, wherever practicable; and, as will be presently shown, the introduction of the tea-plant has opened out a new source of prosperity. It is believed that the population has more than doubled during the twenty years which have elapsed since British annexation. From motives of precaution, a regiment of Native infantry is stationed in permanent cantonments at the hill pass of Bax\u00e1.\n\n**Population.**\u2014Prior to 1881, no synchronous Census of the entire District was made in Jalp\u00e1igur\u00ed; the enumeration in 1872 was confined to the permanently settled part of the District, the Settlement Officer's estimate of the population of the Western Dw\u00e1rs in 1870 being accepted. These figures made up a total population in 1872 of 418,665. In 1881, a simultaneous enumeration over the whole District disclosed a total population of 581,562, the increase amounting to 162,897, or 38\u00b79 per cent., in the nine years. Although there can be no doubt that a very large portion of this reported increase is due to deficiencies in the previous enumeration and estimate, it is certain that a considerable portion represents a real advance in the population. The spread of tea cultivation of late years has attracted much European capital and native labour to the Western Dw\u00e1rs Sub-division. The general results arrived at by the Census of 1881, may be briefly summarized as follows:\u2014Area, 2884 square miles; number of villages, 971; houses, 98,101, of which 94,795 were occupied and 3306 unoccupied. Population, 581,562, namely, 305,555 males and 276,007 females. Average density of population, 201\u00b765 per square mile, varying from 60\u00b723 in the Western Dw\u00e1rs or Al\u00edpur Sub-division, to 343\u00b741 in the head-quarters Sub-division. Number of villages per square mile, '34; persons per village, 955; houses per square mile, 34\u00b702; persons per house, 6\u00b713. It seems probable that, when railway communication is completed during the next few years between Jalp\u00e1iguri and the overcrowded Districts of Behar, a considerable influx of population will set in toward the Dw\u00e1rs. Classified according to age, there were, under 12 years\u2014102,230 males and 95,479 females; total children, 197,709, or 34 per cent. of the total population. As regards religion, Hindus numbered 367,891, or 63\u00b73 per cent. of the population; Muhammadans, 208,513, or 35\u00b78 per cent.; Buddhists, 486; Jains, 6; Christians, 159; and non-Hindu aboriginal tribes, 4507. The great bulk of the population belongs to the semi-Hinduized aboriginal tribe known as Koch or R\u00e1jbansi, which numbers 208,322 in the permanently settled tract, and is\nascertained to form as much as two-thirds of the total inhabitants in the Western Dwar\u00e1s. To these figures there ought to be added a large proportion of those returned in the Census Report as Musalm\u00e1ns, who are known historically to be of Koch descent. The head-quarters of this race are in the adjoining State of Kuch Behar; but Kochs, R\u00e1jbans\u00eds, or Pal\u00eds are thickly scattered through all Northern Bengal, from Assam to the frontier of Purniah. Aboriginal tribes include Ur\u00e1ons and Mechs. Their numbers are not returned separately in the Census Report, but the latter race is strongly represented in the Dwar\u00e1s, where they constitute about one-ninth of the population. They are identical with the Assam tribe of Cacharis, and probably connected with the Kochs. Their mode of agriculture is that known as j\u00faim, which consists in burning down a fresh patch of jungle land every year; on these clearings, rice, cotton, and mustard are grown together, the only agricultural implement used being the d\u00e1o or hill knife. Of the Hindus proper, the most numerous caste is that of the low caste of Tiors, numbering 35,896, and Bagd\u00eds, who form the great majority of the labourers on the tea gardens, 24,527. Br\u00e1hmans numbered 3909; R\u00e1jputs, 1269; K\u00e1yasths, 3782; Baniy\u00e1s, 2672; Kaibartt\u00e1s, 5838; and T\u00e1nt\u00eds, 5453. The Muhammadans are classified according to sect into Sunn\u00eds, 189,441; Shi\u00e1s, 6828; and unspecified, 12,244. The Christians include 81 Europeans, 2 Australians, 14 Eurasians, and 62 natives of India and \u2018others.\u2019 Vaishnavs and other caste-rejecting Hindus numbered 3448. The Br\u00e1hma Sam\u00e1j is represented by about 20 members, who meet regularly at Jalpaiguri town.\n\nThe population is of a purely rural character. There is only one town with upwards of 5000 inhabitants, and even trading villages are few. The only places worth mention are Jalpaiguri town on the T\u00edst\u00e1 river, with a population in 1881 of 7936, which is distinguished from other villages merely by the civil offices; the prosperous mart of Baur\u00e1, also on the T\u00edst\u00e1; the military outpost of Baxa, half-way up the Sinchul\u00e1 mountains; and the widespread ruins of the city of Prithu R\u00e1j\u00e1, one of the fabled monarchs of the early kingdom of K\u00e1mr\u00fap. Small forts, temples, and tanks, built by Hindus or Muhammadans, abound in the south-western corner of the District, which formed, two centuries ago, the extreme limit of the Mughal Empire. Of the 971 villages comprising the District, 195 are returned as containing less than two hundred inhabitants; 345 from two to five hundred; 245 from five hundred to a thousand; 174 from one to two thousand; 11 from two to three thousand; and 1 upwards of five thousand inhabitants. As regards occupation, the male population are returned under the following six classes:\u2014(1) Professional, including military and civil officials, and the learned professions, 4811; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 9559; (3) commercial class,\nincluding merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 14,260; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 146,574; (5) manufacturing and industrial class, artisans, etc., 14,161; (6) indefinite and unspecified, comprising general labourers and male children, 116,190.\n\nMaterial Condition of the People.\u2014The people of Jalpaiguri District are well off, happy, and contented. The necessaries of life are cheap and easily procurable; and the means of gaining a livelihood by agriculture is open to all. There is abundance of rich soil, especially in the Western Dw\u00e1rs, still easily reclaimable; and as the rents are very light, the prosperous condition of the people naturally follows. The ordinary dress of a well-to-do shopkeeper generally consists of a waistcloth (dhuti), with a cotton sheet or shawl (ch\u00e1d\u00e1r), when at home; with the addition, when visiting friends or places of public resort, of a coat (chapk\u00e1n or pir\u00e1n), a turban or cap, and a pair of shoes. The dress of a well-to-do husbandman or landholder (jotd\u00e1r) is similar to the above. The clothing of an ordinary peasant, who cultivates his holding with his own hands, consists, while engaged in field work, of simply a narrow strip of cloth round the loins (nangti); but when making a visit or attending market, he wears a waistcloth and cotton shawl. The houses are generally built on supports of bamboos or wooden posts, well thatched with grass on a framework of bamboo or reeds; the walls are of bamboo mats, reeds, or grass, generally plastered over with mud, the different parts of the house being tied together with string or rattan. A shopkeeper has usually two or three rooms in his house, with a verandah, and a small out-house for cooking and storing his grain. A peasant's dwelling generally consists of two rooms, but the homestead of a well-to-do jotd\u00e1r often contains as many as ten or twelve separate huts within an enclosure.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Rice constitutes the staple crop in all parts of the District. Of the total food supply, the \u00e1man or haimantik rice, sown on low-lying lands and reaped in winter, forms from 60 to 75 per cent.; the remainder is made up by the \u00e1us or bhada\u00ed rice, sown on high lands and reaped in September; and by wheat and barley. Mustard seed is extensively grown throughout the District; cotton is the export staple of the Dw\u00e1rs, jute and tobacco of the Regulation tract. Manure, in the form of cow-dung, is used by the cultivators for special crops, the quantity being determined by the number of cattle that they own. Irrigation is commonly practised in the Western Dw\u00e1rs. \u00c1man rice land is never suffered to lie fallow, but the peasants recognise that the other crops grow better if the soil enjoys an occasional rest. There is still spare land uncultivated even in the Regulation tract; and in the Western Dw\u00e1rs it has been estimated that about three-fourths of the land now waste is capable of cultivation. The average produce of paddy or unhusked rice from an\nacre of land is about 22 cwt., worth locally from \u00a32, 10s. to \u00a34. In the Dw\u00e1rs, the rent of rice land varies from 1s. to 6s. per acre; in the remainder of the District, from 2s. to 7s. 6d. Jute land lets at somewhat higher rates. The land in the Western Dw\u00e1rs is managed as the immediate property of Government; in the Regulation tract, the zam\u00edn-d\u00e1rs are the proprietors, subject only to the payment of a fixed revenue. But the subordinate tenures in either case are much the same. First comes the jotd\u00e1r, who usually possesses a permanent interest in his farm, and has under-tenants called chuk\u00e1n\u00edd\u00e1rs or mul\u00e1nd\u00e1rs. The actual cultivator is the praj\u00e1, who has no rights in the soil, but is allowed to retain a share of the produce. It has been the object of the recent settlement in the Western Dw\u00e1rs to fix the relative positions of these several parties.\n\nThe rate of wages in Jalp\u00e1iguri are somewhat arbitrary, as the majority of the day-labourers are immigrants from Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur or Nep\u00e1l. The ordinary wages of labourers are 6d. a day, or from 10s. to 12s. a month; skilled workmen earn from \u00a31 to \u00a32 a month. These rates are considerably higher than used to be paid before the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n war of 1864. The prices of food-grains appear to have considerably more than doubled of late years. In 1869, common rice fetched from 1s. 4d. to 1s. 8d. per cwt.; by 1870, the price had risen to 4s. 1d.; and by 1882\u201383 to 5s. 4d., the average rate for the five years preceding 1882\u201383 being 7s. per cwt.\n\nThe calamities of flood or drought are almost unknown in the District, and a general destruction of the crops from such a cause has never occurred. Scarcity elsewhere only affects Jalp\u00e1iguri by stimulating the exportation of grain, and thus raising the market prices. In the improbable event of a local scarcity, the inhabitants of the Dw\u00e1rs could fall back upon the wild produce of the jungle; while those in the settled tract have now been saved from the danger of isolation by the proximity of the Northern Bengal State Railway. If the price of rice were to rise in January, after the harvesting of the \u00e1man crop, to 10s. per cwt., it should be regarded as a sign of approaching distress.\n\nTea.\u2014The soil and climate of the Western Dw\u00e1rs have proved extremely suitable for the tea plant. The cultivation and manufacture of tea has made rapid progress of late years, and the industry is now established on a secure basis. In 1876\u201377, the total number of plantations was 13, covering an area of 818 acres, and yielding 29,520 lbs. of tea. By 1882, the number of gardens at work was 60, with 4670 acres under mature, and 3598 acres under immature plants. Total out-turn in 1882, 1,865,801 lbs.; average out-turn, 399 lbs. per acre of mature plants. The gardens are situated at an elevation of from 250 to 1500 feet. The chief requisite for a large development of the tea industry in the Western Dw\u00e1rs is improved communications, and many\nplanters have freely subscribed to the construction of roads. The state of the roads, and deficiency of means of communication, can only be realized by travelling through the north-eastern part of the District. British capital has flowed rapidly into tea cultivation in that tract, but it has had to encounter great difficulties, from the poverty of the local road-funds, which it is hoped that the Government will before long remove. Jalpaiguri District has important advantages over the neighbouring Districts of Assam for the purposes of tea cultivation, as the labour supply finds its way freely into it, without being placed under the surveillance of the law. More restrictions have been found necessary to ensure the health and safety of coolies on the longer journey to Assam, and to protect them in their new and often isolated homes. The comparative nearness of Jalpaiguri to the labour-yielding Districts of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur enables the coolies to make the journey in small parties of 20 to 150, by foot or by rail, under native head-men, and without the intervention of European agency or of legislative safeguards for their recruitment and transit. Jalpaiguri District does not therefore come under the operation of the Labour Transport or internal Emigration Acts. The railway which intersects the District still further simplifies the problems of immigration.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014No special native industries have been developed in Jalpaiguri. Among the lower classes, and especially with the aboriginal tribes, the scanty garments are woven by members of the household, who also build their own dwellings and make their own agricultural implements. Of late years trade has been stimulated by the demand for agricultural produce from the south, and by the institution of fairs on the Bhutan frontier. The chief exports are jute, tobacco, timber, tea, and a little rice. The imports are piece-goods, salt, and betel-nuts. The tobacco trade is concentrated at the busy mart of Baur\u00e1, on the T\u00edst\u00e1, whence the produce is despatched down the river to the emporia of Sir\u00e1jganj, N\u00e1r\u00e1yanganj, M\u00e1nikganj, and Go\u00e1l\u00e1nd\u00e1. Baur\u00e1 can be reached by large boats of from 30 to 40 tons burden all the year round. Jalpaiguri town, higher up the same river, is only accessible by such vessels during the rains. The Kar\u00e1ttoy\u00e1 is the second river in commercial importance; the chief mart on its banks is Deb\u00edganj, whence large quantities of timber are floated down into Din\u00e1jpur and Pabn\u00e1. The timber-cutting is effected by the Mechs, who are very skilful at hollowing trees into canoes.\n\nThe Northern Bengal State Railway intersects the District throughout its entire length, with stations at Haldib\u00e1ri, Jalpaiguri, Shik\u00e1rpur, and Siliguri, whence the line is continued to D\u00e1rjiling by the narrow gauge D\u00e1rjiling and Himalayan railway. The Jalpaiguri Sub-division is well supplied with roads, some of which are maintained by the Public Works Department, while the majority are under local management.\nThis advantage it owes to its being on the highway both to Darjiling and Bhutan, and also to its commanding the emigration route between Behar and the Assam valley. There are no artificial canals.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1870-71, the net revenue of Jalpaiguri District amounted to \u00a332,994, towards which the land-tax contributed \u00a323,983, or 72 per cent.; the net expenditure was \u00a316,135, or just one-half the revenue. In 1881-82, the net revenue of Jalpaiguri District had increased to \u00a350,268, of which \u00a337,844 was derived from the land-tax. The land revenue derived from the permanently settled tract amounts to \u00a313,675. The settlement in the Western Dwars is made for a period of ten years with the jotdars or farmers, except in the case of the Mechs, who pay a capitation tax. For police purposes, the District is divided into 8 thanas or police circles, with 4 outposts. In 1882, the regular police force numbered 282 men of all ranks, maintained at a total cost of \u00a35879. In addition, there was a rural police or village watch of 1215 men. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property consisted of 1497 officers and men, giving one man to every 19 square mile of the area or to every 388 persons in the population. The estimated total cost, including the rural police, which is maintained by the villagers, was \u00a312,263, averaging \u00a34, 5s. per square mile and 5d. per head of population. In that year, the total number of persons in Jalpaiguri District convicted of any offence, great or small, was 839, being 1 person to every 693 of the population. By far the greater proportion of the convictions were for petty offences. There is one jail in the District, at Jalpaiguri town, recently constructed in place of the old one condemned on account of its excessive unhealthiness. In 1882, the average daily number of prisoners was 101, of whom 35 were females; the labouring convicts averaged 97.9. These figures show 1 prisoner to every 5752 of the population.\n\nEducation encounters great difficulties in Jalpaiguri, partly owing to the circumstance that the people are not gathered into villages, but live each family in its own sequestered homestead. In 1870, the earliest year for which statistics are available, the number of schools open was 64, attended by 1372 pupils. By 1882, the inspected schools had increased to 155, and the pupils to 3582, showing 1 school to every 18.6 square miles, and 4.2 pupils to every thousand of the population. This is exclusive of uninspected schools. The Census Report of 1881 returned 5349 boys and 135 girls as under instruction, including schools not inspected, besides 12,023 males and 193 females who are able to read and write, but not under instruction.\n\nThe District is divided into 2 administrative Sub-divisions, with 8 police circles; and the Western Dwars are again parcelled out into 11 minor divisions or parganas. In 1882, there were 3 civil judges and 6\nstipendiary magistrates. The only municipality in the District is the municipal union of Jalpaiguri, which in 1882-83 had an income of \u00a3499, of which \u00a3447 were derived from direct taxation. Average incidence of taxation, 1s. 3\u00bdd. per head of municipal population.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate in the vicinity of Jalpaiguri town does not materially differ from that common to Northern Bengal, except that the rainfall is heavier, and during the cold months fogs and mists are of daily occurrence. The prevailing wind is from the east. The average annual rainfall for the 12 years ending 1881 was 126\u00b710 inches; the average temperature is about 76\u00b0 F. The climate of the Western Dwaras is markedly different, especially on the lower slopes of the Bhutan Hills. The hot weather here disappears altogether, and the rains last continuously from April to October. The average annual rainfall at Baxta for the 12 years ending 1881 was returned at 219\u00b728 inches, the temperature at 74\u00b0.\n\nThe principal diseases are malarious fevers, especially severe in the taridi; splenitis, enlargement of the liver, diarrhoea, and dysentery. Goitre is very common in the hilly portion of the Dwaras; and the native troops stationed at Baxa regularly suffer from scurvy, which is said to be induced by the impossibility of obtaining fresh vegetables during the prolonged rainy season. Of recent years, some very fatal outbreaks of cholera have occurred. The registered statistics (which are below the truth) show a registered death-rate during 1882 of 15\u00b734 per thousand. There were in 1882 four charitable dispensaries in the District, at which 295 in-door and 8301 out-door patients were treated during the year.

Area, 1493 square miles; number of villages, 814; houses, 86,106. Total population (1881) 497,779, namely, 259,347 males and 238,432 females; average density of population, 333\u00b74 per square mile; average persons per village, 611; houses per square mile, 59\u00b770; persons per house, 5\u00b778. Hindus numbered 300,747; Muhammadans, 196,192; Christians, 123; Buddhists, 439; Jains, 6; and aborigines, 272. This Sub-division comprises the six police circles of Jalpaiguri, Siliguri, Bod\u00e1, P\u00e1tgr\u00e1m, Main\u00e1guri, and Kairanti. In 1883 it contained 2 civil and 8 criminal courts; strength of regular police, 185 men; village watch or rural police (chaukid\u00e1s), 1002.\n\nJalpaiguri.\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Jalpaiguri District, Bengal; situated on the west or right bank of the Tista, in lat. 26\u00b0 32' 20\" N., long. 88\u00b0 45' 38\" E. Population (1881) 7936, namely, Hindus, 4245; Muhammadans, 3647; and 'others,' 44. Area of town site, 1800 acres. Formerly a cantonment for a regiment\nof Native infantry, but the military force is now withdrawn. This town has only risen into importance from the creation of the District as a separate jurisdiction in 1869, since which date its population has doubled, and its prosperity greatly increased by the opening of the Northern Bengal State Railway. The town is a municipal union, and in 1882-83 had an income of \u00a3499, of which \u00a3447 were derived from direct taxation. Average incidence of taxation, 1s. 3\u00bdd. per head of municipal population.\n\n**Jalpesh.**\u2014Town in the Western Dw\u00e1rs, Jalp\u00e1igur\u00ed District, Bengal. Lat. 26\u00b0 31' N., long. 88\u00b0 54' 30\" E. Noted for its annual fair, held on the occasion of the Siva-ritri festival in February, at the temple of Jalpesh, which is about two hundred years old, and built on the site of a still older structure. It contains an image of the god Siva. The articles sold at the fair are chiefly cloth goods, umbrellas, hookahs, brass utensils, blankets, gh\u00ed, etc. This gathering lasts for ten days, and is attended by about 2000 people.\n\n**Jam\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d** (or Narasinha-angadi).\u2014Town in Uppinangadi taluk, South K\u00e1nara District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 13\u00b0 2' N., and long. 75\u00b0 22' E.; houses, 235. Population (1871) 1112. Not returned in the Census Report of 1881. Founded by Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, who encamped here when returning from Mangalore in 1784, and, noticing the strength of its situation, built and garrisoned a fortress on an almost inaccessible rock, lying to the west of the town and rising sheer from the plain. Jam\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d was destroyed by the Coorg R\u00e1j\u00e1 in 1799. The garrison, however, held out for six weeks against a British force, and only surrendered after a bombardment which cut away their sole means of retreat. The commandant committed suicide. The unusual proportion of Muhammadans in the neighbouring village attests its former military occupation.\n\n**Jamalavaya Durga.**\u2014Hill in Tiruv\u00far Sub-division, Kistna District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 16\u00b0 57' 22\" N., long. 80\u00b0 38' 8\" E.; 1856 feet above sea-level.\n\n**Jam\u00e1lpur.**\u2014Sub-division of Maimansingh District, Bengal. Lat. 24\u00b0 43' to 25\u00b0 25' 45\" N., and long. 89\u00b0 38' to 90\u00b0 20' 45\" E. Area, 1244 square miles; towns and villages, 1879; houses, 65,402. Population (1872) 414,469; (1881) 497,766, namely, males 255,010, and females 242,756. Increase of population in nine years, 83,297, or 20\u00b710 per cent. Average density of population, 400 per square mile; villages per square mile, 1\u00b75; persons per village, 265; houses per square mile, 63; persons per house, 7\u00b76. According to religion, Muhammadans numbered 381,572, or 76\u00b76 per cent.; Hindus, 110,740, or 22\u00b73 per cent.; Christians, 12; non-Hindu aboriginal tribes, 5442. This Sub-division comprises the 3 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of Jam\u00e1lpur, Sherpur, and Diw\u00e1nganj. In 1883, it contained a deputy magistrate\nand deputy collector's court and 2 munsif's courts; regular police, 79 men; village watch, 851 men.\n\nJam\u00e1lpur.\u2014Head-quarters town and municipality of Jam\u00e1lpur Subdivision, Maimansingh District, Bengal; situated on the west bank of the Brahmaputra, in lat. 24\u00b0 56' 15\" N., and long. 89\u00b0 58' 55\" E. Population (1881) 14,727, namely, Muhammadans, 10,360; Hindus, 4366; 'other,' 1. Area of town site, 9318 acres. Gross municipal revenue (1881-82), \u00a3430, of which \u00a3413 was derived from taxation; rate of taxation, 6\u00bdd. per head of municipal population (15,264). Jam\u00e1lpur is connected with Nasir\u00e1b\u00e1d (Nusseer\u00e1b\u00e1d), 35 miles distant, by a good road; ferry across the Brahmaputra. This town was a military station up to 1857.\n\nJam\u00e1lpur.\u2014Town and municipality in Monghyr District, Bengal; situated at the foot of the Monghyr Hills, in lat. 25\u00b0 18' 45\" N., long. 86\u00b0 32' 1\" E. Chiefly noted as containing the largest iron workshops in India, which belong to the East India Railway Company, on its loop-line, 299 miles from Calcutta, covering an area of 30 acres. These works, in addition to about 500 European workmen, employ about 3000 native labourers, and have attracted the best iron-smiths from many parts of Behar. The Company does its work through a number of native middle-men, who are paid by the piece. Population (1872) 10,453; (1881) 13,213, namely, Hindus, 9625; Muhammadans, 3038; and 'others,' 550. Area of town site, 832 acres. Municipal income in 1881-82, \u00a31523, of which \u00a31429 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 2s. 1\u00bdd. per head. Neat and substantial dwellings for the European employees and their families are laid out in streets and squares near the railway station. The native town and b\u00e1z\u00e1r is separated from the European quarter by the railway. Jam\u00e1lpur contains an institute with library and reading rooms, a theatre, swimming bath, church, schools, race-course, and cricket ground, maintained or largely supported by the railway authorities. The water-supply is afforded by means of a canal cut from the base of the Monghyr Hills.\n\nJambu.\u2014The northern channel leading inland from False Point anchorage, on the coast of the Bay of Bengal, Cuttack District, Orissa, Bengal. A winding stream, which renders navigation dangerous, especially during the freshes, when a strong current comes down. A bar stretches across its mouth for about three-quarters of a mile, with 1 foot of water at lowest tide; after this the channel gradually deepens to 10 feet (lowest tide), and higher up still, to 18 feet. Towards Deulp\u00e1ra, some 12 or 15 miles from the mouth, the Jambu shoals and narrows to such an extent that this point becomes the safe limit of navigation for heavily laden country boats. The entire course of this channel is through a desolate country, which during floods forms one large sea or jungle-covered swamp. The Jambu is now the property of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bardw\u00e1n.\nJ\u00e1mbughora.\u2014Chief village of the Narukot State, Panch Mah\u00e1l District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 22\u00b0 19' 30\" N., long. 73\u00b0 47' E. Here in 1858, the Naikd\u00e1 tribe attacked a detachment of the 8th Regiment Native Infantry. In 1868, J\u00e1mbughora was sacked by a robber band from Joriy\u00e1 in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. Since then a police station designed with a view to defence has been erected at a cost of \u00a34270. It is a quadrangular enclosure, having at each of the four corners a bastion, with steps leading to a roof, terraced and provided with parapets loopholed for musketry. The chief of the Narukot State lives at Jhotwar, half a mile to the north-west. School and dispensary.\n\nJambukeswaram (a title of Siva).\u2014A famous temple in Sr\u00edrangam island, Trichinopoli, Madras Presidency. Lat. 10\u00b0 51' N., and long. 78\u00b0 44' E.; \u00be of a mile east of the great Sr\u00edrangam (Seringham) temple, but rivalling the latter in architectural beauty and interest, and probably exceeding it in antiquity. 'It possesses only three courts, but these are much larger than the inner ones of the other temple; and being built on a uniform and well-arranged plan, produce a finer effect. It probably belongs to the 12th century, and must have been completed before the larger pagoda was begun. The first gateway of the outer enclosure is not large, but it leads direct to the centre of a hall containing some 400 pillars. On the right, these open on a tank fed by a perpetual spring, which is one of the wonders of the place. The corresponding space on the left was intended to be occupied by the 600 columns requisite to make up the 1000, but this was never completed. Between the two gopuras of the second enclosure is a very beautiful portico of cruciform shape, leading to the door of the sanctuary, which, however, makes no show externally, and access to its interior is not vouchsafed to the profane. The age of this temple is the same as that of its great rival, except that, being all of one design, it probably was begun and completed at once, and, from the simplicity of its parts and details, may be earlier than the great buildings of Tirumalla Nayak. If we assume 1600 A.D., with a margin of ten or fifteen years either way, we shall probably not err much in its date.'\n\n\u2014(Fergusson.)\n\nThere is an error in the foregoing as to the number of the so-called '1000 pillars.' 'There are in reality 796 of them, and, if the 142 round the little tank that adjoins the hall are added, the total reaches 938. There are five enclosures in the building. Of these, the first or inner one, in which the nim\u00e1na is, measures 123 feet by 126 feet, with a wall 30 feet high round it. The second is 306 feet by 197, with a wall 35 feet high; there is a gopura 65 feet high in this enclosure, and several small mandaps. The third enclosure is 745 feet by 197, surrounded by a wall 30 feet high. In this are two gopuras, in height 73 and 100 feet respectively; there is a cocoa-nut tope in\nthis portion of the building, containing a small tank and temple, to which the image from the great Vishnu pagoda in the Srirangam island is brought for one day in the year. The hall and tank described by Mr. Fergusson are in the fourth enclosure, which measures 2436 feet by 1493; the wall surrounding it is 35 feet high and 6 feet in thickness. The fifth or outer enclosure contains 4 streets of houses; here is a small gopura, about sixty years old, over the western entrance.\n\n'Several inscriptions are found in the various parts of the building; but these are of no great use from a historical point of view, as they are simply accounts of grants of land made to the pagoda from time to time, and, with a single exception, without dates. One of them, however, is stated to have been written about the year 1480 A.D.; and if this be relied on, we must conclude that the temple is nearly 400 years old.\n\n'It appears that the Jambukeswaram pagoda had an endowment of 64 villages in 1750; in 1820, it owned only 15; in 1851, a money allowance of \u00a3945 was given to the pagoda in lieu of its lands, and this sum is now paid to the trustees every year.'\u2014(Lewis Moore, C.S.)\n\nJ\u00e1mbulgh\u00e1t\u00e1.\u2014Town in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces. Lat. 20\u00b0 33' N., and long. 79\u00b0 30' E.; 7 miles north-east of Chim\u00far. The market, held twice a week, is the largest in the District, the chief products sold being cotton cloth and iron. The extensive quarries of soapstone, a mile from the village, have been worked for over a hundred years; about 50 cart-loads are annually quarried and fashioned into bowls and platters. Near these quarries are others of a very fine black serpentine, where for three years Raghuji III. employed 250 workmen on fixed wages for eight months in the year. With the stone he constructed a temple at N\u00e1gpur. Since his death, the quarries have fallen in, and in 1881 the village contained only 605 inhabitants. Police outpost.\n\nJamb\u00far.\u2014Village in Nanjar\u00e1jpatn\u00e1 t\u00e1luk of Coorg. Situated in lat. 12\u00b0 34' N., long. 75\u00b0 53' E. Population (1881) 172. Thirteen miles from Merk\u00e1raon the Manjir\u00e1b\u00e1d road. Head-quarters of the P\u00e1rpattig\u00e1r of Gadin\u00e1d. Weekly market on Thursdays. Small tomb and temple of Singar\u00e1j, one of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Coorg. Coffee estates in the neighbourhood.\n\nJ\u00e1mbusar.\u2014Sub-division of Broach District, Bombay Presidency; bounded on the north by the river Mahi; on the east by Baroda territory; on the south by the Dh\u00e1dhar river; on the west by the Gulf of Cambay. Total area, 373 square miles. Population (1872) 93,249; (1881) 77,772, namely, 40,415 males and 37,357 females; total decrease (1872 to 1881), 15,477, or 19.9 per cent. Density of population, 208.5 per square mile. In 1881, Hindus numbered\n63,882; Muhammadans, 13,036; and 'others,' 854. The Sub-\ndivision contains 1 town and 82 villages; numbers of occupied houses,\n18,711; unoccupied houses, 4184; civil courts, 1; criminal courts,\n2; regular police, 53 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 694; police\nstations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 1. Land revenue (1882-83), \u00a379,479. There\nis a total cultivable area within the Sub-division of about 156,000\nacres. Six square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated State\nvillages. The country consists of two tracts of level land. Towards\nthe west lies a barren plain, and in the east is a well-wooded stretch of\nlight soil. In the latter tract are large and sweet springs, but in the\nformer tract the water-supply is defective. Number of wells (1874),\n700; tanks, 323; ploughs, 5927; carts, 5036; oxen, 17,092; cows,\n2448; buffaloes, 18,645; horses, 656. The staple crops are jo\u00e1r\n(Sorghum vulgare), b\u00e1jra (Holcus spicatus), wheat, and miscellaneous\ncrops of pulses, peas, tobacco, cotton, and indigo. The average annual\nrainfall is 23.5 inches.\n\nJ\u00e1mbusar.\u2014Chief town and municipality of the J\u00e1mbusar Sub-\ndivision of Broach District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 22\u00b0 3' 30\" N.,\nand long. 72\u00b0 51' 30\" E. Population (1872) 14,924; (1881) 11,479,\nnamely, 5925 males and 5554 females. Of the total population in\n1881, 8741 were Hindus, 2379 Muhammadans, 129 Jains, 1 Christian,\n16 P\u00e1ris, and 213 'others.' Area of town, 348 acres; persons\nper acre, 32. Municipal revenue (1882-83), \u00a3664; municipal\nexpenditure, \u00a3595; rate of taxation, 1s. 6d. per head of municipal\npopulation. In former times, when Tank\u00e1ri\u00e1, 10 miles south-west\nof J\u00e1mbusar, was a port of but little less consequence than Broach,\nJ\u00e1mbusar itself enjoyed a considerable trade. Indigo was then the\nchief export. Of late years, since the opening of the railway (1861),\nthe traffic by sea at Tank\u00e1ri\u00e1 has much fallen off. On the other hand,\nJ\u00e1mbusar is only 18 miles distant from the P\u00e1lej station, on the Bombay,\nBaroda, and Central India Railway; and as roads have recently been\nmade connecting J\u00e1mbusar both with P\u00e1lej and Broach (27 miles), a\ntraffic by land has to some extent taken the place of the old sea-borne\ntrade. It is in contemplation to connect Broach and J\u00e1mbusar by rail.\nIn preparing cotton for export, 3 ginning factories were employed here\nin 1874. Tanning, the manufacture of leather, and calico printing are\ncarried on to a small extent, and there are also manufactures of ivory,\narmlets, and toys. In 1880-81 the imports were valued at \u00a321,115,\nand the exports at \u00a3125,419. J\u00e1mbusar has a subordinate judge's\ncourt, post-office, and dispensary. The town was first occupied by the\nBritish in 1775, and remained in their possession until 1783, when it\nwas restored to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Under the treaty of Poona (1817),\nit was finally surrendered to the British. To the north of the town is\na lake of considerable size sacred to N\u00e1g\u00e9swar, the snake-god, with\nrichly-wooded banks, and in the centre of the water a small island about 40 feet in diameter, overgrown with mango and other trees. The water-supply is chiefly derived from this tank. In the town is a strong native-built fort, erected by Mr. Callender when J\u00e1mbusar was held by the British from 1775 to 1783. This fort furnishes accommodation for the treasury, the civil courts, and other Government offices.\n\n**J\u00e1mbva.**\u2014River of Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency. The J\u00e1mbva or J\u00e1mbuva rises near Devalia in Jarod Sub-division of Baroda State, runs a course of 25 miles past the palace of Makarpura, near the hunting grounds of the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, and terminates near Khalipur. Two stone bridges have been thrown across it; one at Kelanpur on the Baroda-Dabhoi road, the other near Makarpura.\n\n**James and Mary Sands.**\u2014Shifting and dangerous alluvial deposits formed in the channel of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, by the meeting of the backwater of the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan with the discharge of the D\u00e1modar. Both of these last-named rivers enter the H\u00fagl\u00ed at sharp angles from the west; the D\u00e1modar nearly opposite Falt\u00e1, about 27 miles by water from Calcutta, and the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan, opposite H\u00fagl\u00ed point, 33 miles down the river from Calcutta. The James and Mary Sands stretch more or less completely up the H\u00fagl\u00ed channel throughout the six miles between the mouths of these two rivers; although the name is sometimes appropriated to the more southern portion of the shoals. The mouth of the D\u00e1modar river is situated in lat. 22\u00b0 17' N., and long. 88\u00b0 7' 30\" E., and that of the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan in lat. 22\u00b0 12' N., and long. 88\u00b0 3' E.\n\nThese fatal sands have long been a terror to seamen, and still form the most dangerous obstacle in the navigation of the H\u00fagl\u00ed. The name was commonly supposed to be a corruption of the Bengali words j\u00e1l-m\u00e1ri, 'The Waters of Death.' But Sir George Birdwood has discovered in the India Office mss. the following entry:\u2014'The Royal James and Mary [James II. and Mary of Modena] arrived in Balasore Roads from the west coast in August, with a cargo of redwood, candy, and pepper, which she had taken up in Madras. Coming up the river H\u00fagl\u00ed on the 24th of September 1694, she fell on a sandbank on this side Tumboleee Point, and was unfortunately lost, being immediately overset, and broke her back, with the loss of four or five men's lives.' 'Tumboleee Point' is shown in the chart of 1745 at the north entrance to the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan river. It is now called Mornington Point. The wreck of this Royal James and Mary was the origin of the name of the sandbank, and shows that it was a dangerous obstruction to navigation as far back as 1694.\n\nHow its dangers were subsequently increased by the opening of the new mouth of the D\u00e1modar will be presently mentioned. The sharp angle at which the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan enters the H\u00fagl\u00ed, opposite H\u00fagl\u00ed Point, would alone suffice to check the current of the main stream of the\nlarger river, and to cause a deposit of its silt. It is probable, therefore, that, independently of the discharge of the D\u00e1modar by its new mouth, 6 miles above the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan debouchure, dangerous sandbanks had existed from a remote period in this section of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river. The sandbanks apparently spread upwards during the first half of the 18th century; that is to say, during the period when the main body of the D\u00e1modar waters was gradually forcing its way southwards to the new D\u00e1modar mouth opposite Falt\u00e1. But the above entry in the 'Consultations' for 1694 prove that this section of the H\u00fagl\u00ed was a dangerous one at the end of the 17th century.\n\nThe records of the Calcutta Bankshall or Port Office commence in 1768, and they speak of the James and Mary Sands as an existing shoal without any reference to their having been recently formed. The proximate cause of their deposit is supposed to have been the shifting of the course of the D\u00e1modar river. The nearly right angle at which the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan enters the H\u00fagl\u00ed would, as above mentioned, have sufficed to check the flow of the H\u00fagl\u00ed current, and lead to a deposit of silt. But when the D\u00e1modar river changed its course, and forced its way into the H\u00fagl\u00ed, also nearly at a right angle, and only 6 miles above the mouth of the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan, a double and an aggravated process of shoaling took place. The James and Mary Sands are the result.\n\nThis change in the course of the D\u00e1modar was going on probably throughout the first half of the 18th century. Formerly, the D\u00e1modar entered the H\u00fagl\u00ed at Nay\u00e1 Sar\u00e1i, about 8 or 10 miles above H\u00fagl\u00ed town. A branch, or tidal channel from the D\u00e1modar, still marks this old course of the river. The D\u00e1modar was, under the Muhammadan Government, confined to that old course by a series of embankments, which counteracted the natural tendency of the river to straighten itself out to the southwards. But the main body of the D\u00e1modar gradually broke through its embankments, and found its way southward to its present point of debouchure into the H\u00fagl\u00ed about 62 miles by the river below its old entrance at Nay\u00e1 Sar\u00e1i. The result was twofold: first, a deterioration of the upper part of the river which had formerly been fed by the old D\u00e1modar; and second, the aggravation of the James and Mary Sands already formed by the junction of the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan and the H\u00fagl\u00ed.\n\nThe period at which this change took place is not fixed. But a clear tradition of it existed among the European inhabitants of Calcutta in the beginning of the present century; and the change is attested by early maps which mark the 'Old D\u00e1modar' as entering the H\u00fagl\u00ed at Nay\u00e1 Sar\u00e1i. The probability is that the change gradually went on during a number of years, and that its effects were distinctly felt by the Calcutta merchants in the last half of the past century. The deterioration of the upper part of the river above Calcutta, has been\nstrongly marked since 1757, when Admiral Watson's 64-gun ship sailed up to Chandarnagore, and when the French Company's ships of 600 and 800 tons are said to have laid off that port. The deterioration of the lower part of the river, represented by the James and Mary Sands, although undoubted, has been by no means so well marked. On the one hand, it must be remembered that, in former times, ships of 700 tons usually, or almost invariably, remained at Diamond Harbour below these shoals. On the other hand, it should also be stated that the reason for this was not necessarily the shallowness but the narrowness of the channel, which rendered it difficult for sailing vessels to tack. We know that in 1801, the Countess of Sutherland, a ship of 1445 tons old measurement, was launched above Calcutta, and sailed down the river.\n\nVarious projects have been proposed to enable ships to avoid this dangerous shoal. About 1821-22, a plan was under discussion for cutting a ship canal from above Falt\u00e1 to Diamond Harbour, so as to escape the James and Mary shoals. In 1839, a prospectus of a larger undertaking, a Diamond Harbour and Calcutta Railway Company, was issued by Captain Boileau of the Bengal Engineers, with a view to avoid the James and Mary and other shoals in the course of the H\u00fagl\u00ed. These schemes were not carried out; and in 1853, statements were placed before the Government, pointing to a serious deterioration in the navigable capacity of the H\u00fagl\u00ed. The Calcutta Chamber of Commerce called the attention of Government to the 'difficult and dangerous state of the river H\u00fagl\u00ed, which threatens at no distant period to render access to the port of Calcutta altogether impracticable for any vessels but those of the smallest tonnage.' The Marquis of Dalhousie accordingly issued a Commission, which, after examining evidence extending from 1804 to 1854, reported in the latter year. All agreed that the James and Mary shoals were among the worst and most dangerous in the river; but great difference of opinion existed as to their increasing deterioration of late years. Out of twenty-three experts, fifteen considered that there was, on the whole, no change for the worse; and eight bore witness to a marked deterioration. The same uncertainty still exists among the experts of the river. Since the H\u00fagl\u00ed Commission reported, two lines of railway have been made respectively to Diamond Harbour, and to Port Canning on the Matl\u00e1 river. Both of these railways avoid the dangers of the James and Mary, and other obstacles between those shoals and Calcutta; and indeed Port Canning was founded at a large expense on the Matl\u00e1 with this view. But neither of these two railways has attracted any share of the commerce of Calcutta, and vessels drawing up to 26 feet still pass up and down the river.\n\nThe James and Mary Sands have two channels named respectively\nthe Eastern and the Western Gut. The following description of them is taken from the H\u00fagl\u00ed Commission's Report of 1854; but it will be superseded before long by a survey of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, now under preparation by Captain Petley, R.N., Deputy-Conservator of the Port of Calcutta. The Eastern Gut 'lies close along the left bank of the river,' the Western Gut 'along the right bank. As a rule, these channels have never good water at the same time, but close and open alternately, according to the season of the year. Some of the witnesses, however, speak to one or two years within their experience when the two channels were open together, but with bad water in both. The Eastern Gut is opened by the freshes of the wet season, when the flood-tides are weak, and the united waters of the D\u00e1modar and H\u00fagl\u00ed direct the force of the strong ebb-tides down the left bank of the latter river. The free flow of the current on the opposite or western bank, being impeded by the rush of water below from the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan almost at right angles, silt is deposited, and the Western Gut fills up. The latter channel, on the other hand, is reopened by the strong flood-tides of the south-west monsoon, when the Makripatti Lumps, joining on to the H\u00fagl\u00ed sand, form a bar across, and close the south entrance of the Eastern Gut. The Western Gut is subject to continual fluctuations as to the position of the best water, and both channels show most important differences in soundings at similar periods, in different years.' Such was the general course of the fluctuations of the James and Mary Sands up to the date of the H\u00fagl\u00ed River Committee in 1854. For their more recent history, we must await Captain Petley's survey.\n\nThe dangers of the James and Mary Sands add materially to the charges on ships coming up the H\u00fagl\u00ed. An establishment for watching the constantly shifting channels has to be maintained. The perils of the passage through these shoals have also to be considered in the charge for pilotage. The evil reputation which the James and Mary give the river has seriously affected the rates of insurance on ships entering or departing from Calcutta. Examples of recent wrecks have been given in article HUGLI RIVER.\n\nJ\u00e1mi.\u2014Town in Srungavarapukota t\u00e1luk of Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency; situated on the Gosth\u00e1n\u00ed river, in lat. 18\u00b0 3' N., and long. 83\u00b0 18' E.

Lat. $14^\\circ 36'$ to $15^\\circ 5'$ N., and long. $78^\\circ 7'$ to $78^\\circ 32' 30\"$ E. It is bounded on the north by Kurnool (Karn\u00fal) District, west by Bellary District; on the south and east by the Pulivendla and Proddot\u00far t\u00e1luks. Area, 616 square miles. Population (1881) 91,958; living in 1 town and 126 villages; number of houses, 18,918; density of population, 149 per square mile. Hindus numbered 82,910; Muhammadans, 7253; and Christians, 1795. Since 1871 the population has decreased 17 per cent., due to the famine which devastated Southern India in 1876-78.\n\nTwo hill ranges intersect the t\u00e1luk, but in no place attain an elevation of more than 1000 feet, and are bare of vegetation. The greater part of the t\u00e1luk is drained by a stream formed by the junction of the Pennair and Chitrav\u00e1ti. The Pennair and Chitrav\u00e1ti join near Gundloor, and then pass through the precipitous gorges of Gandikota. The soil is of the kind called 'black cotton' soil. As irrigation is little resorted to, the crops raised are mostly 'dry' crops. Cholam and cotton are the staples grown, the latter being\nlargely exported to Madras; miscellaneous crops are indigo, gram, and oil-seed. The number of tanks was, in 1875, 30; land cultivated with 'wet' crops or those depending on irrigation, 2690 acres. Water is deficient in the taluk. Inundations of the Pennair and Chitravati, however, occur. In 1851, a flood swept away the village of Chautapalli at the confluence of the rivers. The taluk is ill supplied with roads, particularly in the southern corner of it. Altogether there were only 35 miles of road in 1875. The Madras Railway, north-west line, crosses the Chitravati on a wrought-iron viaduct within the taluk. The viaduct has 40 arches of 70 feet span. There are two railway stations within the taluk, at Muddnur and at Condapur. Condapur is 14 miles from Jammalamadugu, the chief town of the taluk. About 7 miles of the Madras Irrigation Company's Canal cross the north-east corner. Traffic is mostly carried on by means of pack-bullocks. The taluk in 1883 contained 2 criminal courts; police stations (thanas), 7; regular police, 63 men. Land revenue, \u00a321,025.\n\nThe natural fortress of Gandikota, and the fort of Jammalamadugu at the passage of the Pennair near Muddnur, are two remarkable places in the taluk. Fort Gandikota overhangs the Pennair from a scarped rock 300 feet above the water. Innumerable stone steps lead to the mingled bastions and temples which crown the summit. Fort Gandikota was the key to the valley of the Pennair.\n\n**Jammalamadugu.**\u2014Chief town of the Jammalamadugu taluk or Sub-division of Cuddapah (Kadapa) District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 14\u00b0 51' N., long. 78\u00b0 28' E. Population (1871) 4835; (1881) 4846, namely, 2382 males, 2464 females. Of the total population in 1881, 3600 were Hindus, 1241 Muhammadans, and 5 Christians. Area of town site, 3391 acres. The town contains a Government school, and a mission attached to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. Police station. Jammalamadugu is a busy centre of trade, with large exports of indigo and cotton. A small cloth manufacture is carried on. The business season is from March to May.

No regular Census was taken of Kashmir in 1881. Situated in lat. 32\u00b0 43' 52\" N., and long. 74\u00b0 54' 14\" E., on the T\u00e1vi, a tributary of the Chenab, among the mountains of the outer Himalayan range. The people are, as a rule, Hindus. The town and palace stand upon the right bank of the river; the fort overhangs the left or eastern shore at an elevation of 150 feet above the stream. The lofty whitened walls of the palace and citadel present a striking appearance from the surrounding country. An adjacent height commands the fortress, rendering it untenable against modern artillery.\nExtensive and handsome pleasure-grounds. Ruins of great size in the suburbs attest the former prosperity of the city. Once the seat of an independent R\u00e1jput dynasty, whose dominions extended into the plains, and included the modern District of Si\u00e1lkot. It was afterwards conquered by the Sikhs, and formed part of Ranjit Singh's dominions. For its subsequent acquisition by Gul\u00e1b Singh, see Kashmir.\n\nJamna.\u2014River of Northern India.\u2014See Jumna.\n\nJ\u00e1mnagar.\u2014State in Bombay.\u2014See Nawanagar.\n\nJ\u00e1mner.\u2014Sub-division of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 20\u00b0 32' 30\" to 20\u00b0 52' 20\" N., long. 75\u00b0 34' 50\" to 76\u00b0 3' 45\" E. J\u00e1mner Sub-division is bounded on the north by Nas\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d (Nusser\u00e1b\u00e1d) and Bhus\u00e1wal Sub-divisions; on the east by Ber\u00e1r; on the south by the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d State (the Nizam's territory); on the west by Pachora and Nas\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d. Area, 525 square miles; contains 2 towns and 156 villages, with 16,010 houses. Population (1872) 70,321; (1881) 83,535, namely, 42,779 males and 40,756 females; average density, 159 persons per square mile; increase in nine years, 13,184, or 18\u00b77 per cent. In 1881, Hindus numbered 73,613, or 88 per cent. of the population; Muhammadans, 6706, or 8 per cent.; 'others,' 3216. Land revenue (1882\u201383), \u00a322,376.\n\nMost of the Sub-division of J\u00e1mner consists of a succession of rises and dips, with streams of which the banks are fringed with bab\u00fal groves. In the north and south-east low straggling hills covered with young teak rise out of the plain. There is a plentiful and constant supply of water. On the whole, the climate is healthy; but at the close of the rains fever and ague prevail. The rainfall averages 30 inches. The chief streams of the Sub-division are the V\u00e1ghar, with its tributaries the K\u00e1g and the S\u00far, the Harki, and the Sonij. Most of these streams rise in the hills called S\u00e1tm\u00e1l\u00e1s. In addition to the rivers, there was in 1880 an additional supply of water from 1950 wells. Generally speaking, the soil is poor. There is black loam in the valleys, and on the plateaux a rich brownish mould called k\u00e1li munjal. The J\u00e1mner Sub-division is said to have formerly belonged to the Niz\u00e1m of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Deccan. After the battle of Kharda (Deccan), in 1795, it was ceded to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who subsequently made part of it over to Sindhia (Gwalior). The J\u00e1mner Sub-division came into British hands in 1818\u201319. The crops are\u2014staples, jo\u00e1r (Sorghum vulgare) and b\u00e1jra (Penicillaria spicata); miscellaneous, rice, wheat, maize, pulses, cotton, hemp, tobacco, sugar-cane, and indigo. In 1879\u201380, nearly forty per cent. of the cultivated area was under jo\u00e1r. The Sub-division contains 2 criminal courts and 1 police station (th\u00e1n\u00e1); regular police, 49 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 201.\nJ\u00e1mer.\u2014Chief town of the J\u00e1mer Sub-division of Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 20\u00b0 48' N., and long. 75\u00b0 45' E. J\u00e1mer lies 60 miles east by south of Dhulia. Population (1872) 5309, namely, 4263 Hindus, 1259 Muhammadans, 99 Jains, and 84 'others.' Area of town site, 102 acres; situated on the small river K\u00e1g. At one time surrounded with walls and protected by a fort, J\u00e1mer was a place of consequence. Its trade and manufactures have now fallen away. Outside the town is a temple to R\u00e1ma, called R\u00e1m Mandir. Also outside the town are the lines for a detachment of the Poona Horse. Post-office, Government school.\n\nJ\u00e1nni.\u2014River of Bundelkhand, Central India, rising in lat. 24\u00b0 36' N., and long. 78\u00b0 50' E., in the Central Provinces. It flows northwards into Bundelkhand, whence it passes into Chanderi territory, and, after a course of about 70 miles, eventually joins the Betwa, in lat. 25\u00b0 11' N., and long. 78\u00b0 37' E.\n\nJ\u00e1nnia (also called Dabir).\u2014A guaranteed Th\u00e1kurate or chiefship under the Deputy Bhil (M\u00e1npur) Agency of Central India. The chief bears the title of Bh\u00famia of J\u00e1nnia. This chiefship, like those of Rajgarh, Garhi B\u00e1ndpurha, Kothide, and Chikthiabor, is an important historical feature in the history of M\u00e1lw\u00e1. The th\u00e1kurs are all of the Bh\u00fal\u00e1la caste, said to be sprung from the inter-marriage of Bhil and R\u00e1jput. [For some general remarks on the Bh\u00fami\u00e1s, see Rajgarh.] J\u00e1nnia is the family seat from which Nadir Singh, a celebrated Bh\u00famia of J\u00e1nnia, made himself formidable to the surrounding country. The estate consists of 5 villages held from Sindhia under British guarantee. These villages are situated on the table-land of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, and belonged formerly to the Gwalior pargan\u00e1 of Dikthan. The estate also includes Mauz\u00e1 Kher\u00ed of the Hasilpur pargan\u00e1 in M\u00e1lw\u00e1; Dabhar, with its six p\u00e1r\u00e1s or hamlets, in Nim\u00e1r; and the tract of country known as the 47 Bhil p\u00e1r\u00e1s, with J\u00e1nnia as their head-quarters. Mauz\u00e1 Kher\u00ed is held from Holk\u00e1r under British guarantee; Dabhar is held from Dh\u00e1r; and the 47 Bhil p\u00e1r\u00e1s from the British Government, to whom the Bh\u00famia is responsible for the robberies that may take place. The p\u00e1r\u00e1s are partly on the table-land of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, and partly on the slopes of the Vindhya range. The total area of the estate is about 46,575 bigh\u00e1s, of which great part is cultivable waste. A uniform rate of Rs. 3 per plough is at present levied on all cultivation. There are 1 tank and 59 wells in the estate. Population (1879) 2388; (1881) 3205, namely, 1658 males and 1547 females. Hindus numbered 1793; Muhammadans, 198; Jain, 1; and aboriginal tribes, 1213. Number of houses, 603. Two saw\u00e1rs and 13 sip\u00e1his are employed as police. Land revenue (1881), \u00a31600. The M\u00e1npur-Dh\u00e1r road passes through the estate for a distance of 7 miles. The Bh\u00famia of J\u00e1nnia, who has contributed to the cost of construction,\nlevies toll on the traffic passing over it. The present head-quarters of the estate is the village of Kunjrod.\n\n**Jamnotri.**\u2014Hot springs in Garhw\u00e1l State, North-Western Provinces, near the source of the Jumna. Lat. $39^\\circ 59'$ N., long. $78^\\circ 35'$ E. The springs occur on the sides of a massive mountain block, known as B\u00e1nderp\u00fanch, with an elevation of 20,758 feet above sea-level. In the centre stands a lake in which the monkey-god Hanum\u00e1n is said to have extinguished his flaming tail. The water rushes up through a granite rock, and deposits a chalybeate sediment. It has a temperature of $194.7^\\circ$ F. Elevation of the springs, 10,849 feet above the sea.\n\n**Jamod.**\u2014Town in Jalga\u00f3n t\u012bluk of Akola District, Ber\u00e1r.

The urban population in eight municipal towns amounted to 12,610, or 19.3 per cent. of the total tahsil population. Total revenue, \u00a38597. Of a total assessed area of 414,509 acres in 1878-79, as shown in the last quinquennial agricultural statistics published by the Punjab Government, 147,694 acres were under cultivation, of which 36,197 acres were irrigated from Government works, and 4025 acres by private individuals. Of the uncultivated area, 23,144 acres were returned as grazing land, 105,136 acres as cultivable but not under cultivation, and 138,535 acres as uncultivable waste. The total\naverage area under crops for the five years 1877-78 was 128,051 acres, the principal crops being\u2014jo\u00e1r, 58,816 acres; wheat, 28,082 acres; rice, 8353 acres; b\u00e1jra, 8242 acres; indigo, 4400 acres; and cotton, 3933 acres.

Population (1881) 571.\n\nJamr\u00fad.\u2014Fort in Pesh\u00e1war District, Punjab; situated in lat. 34\u00b0 N., and long. 71\u00b0 24' E., at the mouth of the Kh\u00e1ibar (Khyber) Pass. It was occupied by Hari Singh, Ranjit Singh's commander, in 1836; but in April 1837, Dost Muhammad sent a body of Afgh\u00e1ns to attack it. A battle ensued, in which the Sikhs gained a doubtful victory, with the loss of their general, Hari Singh. Elevation above sea-level, 1670 feet. During the military operations of 1878-79, Jamr\u00fad became a place of considerable importance, as the frontier outpost on British territory towards Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n; the fort has been greatly strengthened, and is now capable of accommodating a garrison of about 350 men. It is built in three tiers, the first and second being defended by strong bastions, on which guns can be mounted. The third and highest tier is at an elevation which gives an excellent command over the neighbouring country. The roof of this tier is used as a signalling station with Pesh\u00e1war.\n\nJ\u00e1mt\u00e1ra.\u2014Sub-division of Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s District, Bengal, comprising the th\u00e1n\u00e1 or police circle of J\u00e1mt\u00e1ra.

Population (1881) under 5000. This town lies within the great Gangetic rice plain, but shares in the slope of the country from the Chak\u00e1i and Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh plateau northwards; well drained, and healthy. It contains the usual public buildings, a jail, branch dispensary, Anglovernacular school, distillery, etc. Exports\u2014mahu\u00e1 flowers and oil, buffalo gh\u00ed, shell-lac, oil-seeds, grain, and g\u00far; imports\u2014cotton, tobacco, piece-goods, and metal vessels. Trade carried on by rail and by pack-bullocks; no metalled roads in the town. Jam\u00fai is a town of recent growth, and has no historical interest; to the south of it are the remains of an old fort.\n\nJamun\u00e1.\u2014River of Northern India.\u2014See JUMNA.\n\nJamun\u00e1 (Jamoona or Jan\u00e1di).\u2014The name given to the lower section of the Brahmaputra (q.v.) in Northern Bengal, from its entrance into the plains to its confluence with the Ganges. This channel is of compara-\ntively recent formation, but now carries down by far the largest volume of water. When Major Rennell compiled his map of Bengal towards the close of the last century, the main stream of the Brahmaputra flowed in a south-easterly direction across the District of Maimansingh, past the civil station of Nasirabad, to join the Meghna just below Bhairab Bazar. Some thirty years later, at the time of Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton's survey, this channel had already become of secondary importance. At the present time, though it still bears the name of the Brahmaputra, it has dwindled to a mere watercourse, only navigable during the rainy season.\n\nThe Jamuna, as had been anticipated by Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton, is now the main stream, and in fact the only one marked in common maps. It extends from near Ghoramara in Rangpur District to the river mart of Goalanda in Faridpur, situated at the junction of the Padma or main stream of the Ganges. Its course is almost due north and south, extending approximately from $26^\\circ$ to $24^\\circ$ N. lat. Along the left or east bank stretches the District of Maimansingh; on the right or west bank lie Rangpur, Bogra, and Pabna, all in the Rajshahi Division.\n\nAlthough a modern creation, the Jamuna thus serves as an important administrative boundary. In that portion of its course which fringes Bogra District, it is locally known as the Dao-koba or Hatchet-cut, perhaps to distinguish it from another river of the same name in that District. It runs through a low-lying country, formed out of its own loose alluvial sands. At some points, its channel swells to a breadth in the rainy season of 4 or 5 miles, broken by frequent chars or sandbanks, which form, are washed away, and re-form year after year, according to the varying incidence of the current. The low lands on either bank supply the most favourable soil for jute cultivation in Bengal. The chief river mart on the Jamuna is Sirajganj in Pabna District, which collects the agricultural produce of all the surrounding country. In 1876-77, the total number of country boats registered at Sirajganj was 49,644. The Jamuna is navigable throughout its entire length by native craft of the largest burden at all seasons of the year, and also by the river steamers that ply to Assam.\n\n**Jamuna.**\u2014A deltaic distributary of the Ganges, or rather the name given to a part of the waters of the Ichhamati during a section of its course. The Jamuna enters the Twenty-four Parganas at Baliani from Nadiya District; and after a south-easterly route through the Twenty-four Parganas, winds amid the forests and jungles of the Sundarbans until it empties itself into the Raimangal, a short distance from where that estuary merges in the sea, in lat. $21^\\circ 47'$ N., and long. $89^\\circ 13'$ E. The Jamuna is a deep river, and navigable throughout the year by trading boats of the largest size. Where it enters the Twenty-four Parganas, the stream is about 150 yards wide, but its breadth gradually\nincreases in its progress southwards to from 300 or 400 yards. The canals which run from Calcutta eastward fall into this river at Husain\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\n**Jamun\u00e1.**\u2014A river of Assam, rising in lat. $26^\\circ 31'$ N., and long. $93^\\circ 31'$ E., in the north of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills, and flowing first south and then west along the southern foot of the Rengn\u00e1 Hills, finally falls into the Kapili, a tributary of the Brahmaputra, in Nowgong District, at the village of Jamun\u00e1-mukh, in lat. $26^\\circ 5'$ N., and long. $92^\\circ 47'$ E. Its tributaries in the hills are the Dikhru, Sargat\u00ed, and Pathr\u00e1des\u00e1, all small streams. In the lower part of its course it is navigable by boats of 4 tons burthen during the greater part of the year. Coal and limestone of good quality are found in certain portions of its bed.\n\n**Jamun\u00e1 (Jaboon\u00e1).**\u2014A river of Northern Bengal, probably representing one of the old channels of the T\u00edst\u00e1. It rises in Din\u00e1jpur District, not far from the boundary of Rangpur, and flowing due south along the border of Bogr\u00e1, finally falls into the Atr\u00e4i, itself a tributary of the Ganges, near the village of Bhaw\u00e1n\u00edpur in R\u00e1jsh\u00e1h\u00ed District. In the lower part of its course it is navigated all the year round by country boats of considerable burthen, but higher up it only becomes navigable during the rainy season, from June to October. The chief river marts on the banks of the Jamun\u00e1 are Ph\u00falb\u00e1ri and Bir\u00e1mpur in Din\u00e1jpur District, and Hill\u00ed in Bogr\u00e1, just beyond the Din\u00e1jpur boundary. Hill\u00ed is one of the largest rice marts in Northern Bengal.\n\n**Jamw\u00e1ri.**\u2014River in Oudh; a small tributary of the Sar\u00e1yan, rising in Bhurw\u00e1r\u00e1 village, Kheri District, in lat. $27^\\circ 56'$ N., and long. $80^\\circ 38'$ E. After flowing a tortuous course of 41 miles, it joins the Sar\u00e1yan on its left bank, in Sult\u00e1npur District, in lat. $27^\\circ 32'$ N., and long. $80^\\circ 47'$ E.\n\n**Janaur\u00e1.**\u2014Town in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Oudh; adjoining Ajodhya.

It contains one civil and one criminal court, a regular police force 117 strong, and a village watch of 850 men.\n\n**Jangipur** (or Jah\u00e1ng\u00edrpur).\u2014Chief town of Jangipur Sub-division of Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal; situated on the left bank of the Bh\u00e1gir\u00e1thi, in lat. 24\u00b0 28' N., and long. 88\u00b0 6' 45\" E. Population (1872) 11,361; (1881) 10,187, namely, Hindus, 6378; Muhammadans, 3790; 'others,' 19. Area of town site, 640 acres. Municipal revenue (1881\u201382), \u00a3834; average incidence of taxation, rs. 7\u00bdd. per head. The town is said to have been founded by the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. During the early years of British rule, it was an important centre of the silk trade, and the site of one of the Company's Commercial Residencies. The number of boats registered here annually is about 10,000; the amount of toll, \u00a38000, or about one-third of the total gross revenue derived from the Nadiy\u00e1 rivers.\n\n**Janjir\u00e1** (Habs\u00e1n).\u2014Native State within the Political Agency of Kol\u00e1ba (Colaba), in the Konk\u00e1n, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 18\u00b0 to 18\u00b0 31' N., and long. 72\u00b0 53' to 73\u00b0 17' E. The State is bounded north by the Kundalika or Roh\u00e1 creek in the British District of Kol\u00e1ba; east by the Roh\u00e1 and Mah\u00e1d Sub-divisions of the same District; south by the B\u00e1nkot creek in the District of Ratn\u00e1giri; and west by the Arabian Sea. About the middle of the coast-line, 40 miles long, the R\u00e1jpuri Gulf divides Janjir\u00e1 into two main portions, northern and southern. Area, 325 square miles. Population (1881) 76,361; density of population, 235 per square mile; gross revenue in 1882\u201383,\n\u00a337,600, not including the accounts of the Naw\u00e1b's private treasury, which shows an income of \u00a311,437.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The surface of the State of Janjir\u00e1 or Habs\u00e1n is covered with spurs and hill ranges, averaging about 1000 feet in height, and generally running parallel to the arms of the sea that penetrate eastwards into the interior. The sides of the hills are thickly wooded, except where cleared for cultivation. Inland from the coast, rise ranges of wooded hills. Near the mouths of the creeks, belts of palm groves of from one to two miles broad fringe the shore. Behind the palm groves lie salt marshes and mangrove bushes; behind these again, the rice lands of the valleys. The wealthiest and largest villages nestle in the palm-belt along the coast. Gardeners, the richer fishermen, and palm-tappers inhabit them. Inland, the banks of the creeks are studded with hamlets, occupied by husbandmen who cultivate rice. On the hill-sides, in glens or on terraces, are the huts and scanty clearings of K\u00e1thkaris and other hillmen. The slopes of lower hills are generally rounded and passable by a pony. These slopes, except in the rains, are bare; but at most times, and particularly at the time of high tide, the R\u00e1jpuri creek affords fine views of wooded hill and winding water. During the rains travel is nearly impossible. On the coast, the sand-bars at the mouth of every inlet but the R\u00e1jpuri creek prevent ingress. Further inland, the low rice lands become covered with deposited mud, the main streams are flooded too deeply to be forded, and overgrown forest tracts render difficult the passage from one hill range to another. None of the streams are more than five or six miles in length. The larger watercourses flow westward. During the rains they are torrents, but dwindle to mere rills at other seasons. The chief creeks and backwaters are, beginning from the north, the M\u00e1ndla-Borlai, the N\u00e1ndg\u00e1on, the Marad, the R\u00e1jpuri, the Panchaitan or Dive-Borlai, and the Shriwardhan. Most of the creek entrances are rocky and dangerous. During the navigable season, September to June, they can be entered only by boats of under one-and-a-half tons burthen. Once over the bar, the creeks are mostly of uniform depth throughout their course. The mouth of the R\u00e1jpuri creek is 25 miles south of Bombay. The creek ends at the old town of Mhasla, 14 miles southeast of Janjir\u00e1 town. At springs the tide rises 12 feet in the creek. There is no bar. The bottom is muddy. Shoalest water at low tide, $3\\frac{1}{2}$ fathoms at the entrance of the creek, $4\\frac{1}{2}$ inside the entrance in mid-channel. Steamers can enter, even during the rains, and lie in still water to the south of Janjir\u00e1 island.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of the State of Janjir\u00e1 has increased from 71,966 in 1872 to 76,361 in 1881. Of the total in 1881, males numbered 37,782; females, 38,579. Number of villages, 226; occupied houses, 14,421; unoccupied, 1505. Classified according to religion,\n68,811, or 80.9 per cent. of the population, were Hindus; 13,912, or 18.2 per cent., Muhammadans; 47 Christians; 27 Jains; 2 P\u00e1rs\u00eds; 590 Beni-Isr\u00e6l; and 972 aboriginal tribes. The Beni-Isr\u00e6l, a race of Jewish descent, worship one God, and have no images in their houses. They practise many Jewish rites. The dress and manner of living of the Beni-Isr\u00e6l, who are mostly oil-pressers by trade, are partly Muhammadan and partly Hindu. They speak Mar\u00e1th\u00ed. Though fond of drink, they are steady, enterprising, and prosperous. The Sid\u00eds are the representatives of Habshi or Abyssinian slaves and soldiers of fortune. They are only found in the island of Janjir\u00e1. The Sid\u00eds number over 200. Many of them are related to the Naw\u00e1b or head of the State, and inherit State grants and allowances. The Konk\u00e1nis are the largest and most important community of Janjir\u00e1 Muhammadans. The D\u00e1ld\u00eds are a fishing race which supply boatmen for Bombay harbour. The crews of the Bombay dub\u00e1sh boats,\u2014the 'bumboats' of the harbour,\u2014the steamships of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, and the smaller coasting steamers, are to a great extent recruited from Janjir\u00e1. In the rains, when bad weather prevails in the harbour, the D\u00e1ld\u00eds and other natives of Habs\u00e1n return to their homes. Shriwardhan (population, 7424) is the largest town in the State.\n\nClimate, Products, etc.\u2014The climate of Janjir\u00e1 is moist and relaxing, but not unhealthy. The sea-breeze cools the coast and hill-tops. Along the coast, fever and dysentery prevail from October to January. The heat on the coast ranges from 76\u00b0 F. in the cold weather, and in July and August, at the period of the heaviest rains, to 90\u00b0 in the hot weather and the period at the close of the rains. Inland, where the sea-breeze does not penetrate, the thermometer ranges 7\u00b0 or 8\u00b0 higher. Average rainfall, 100 inches.\n\nSea-fishing for pomphlet and other large fish is the occupation of the bulk of the people. The staple crops are cocoa-nuts, betel-nuts, rice, the coarser varieties of grain, and hemp. Timber and firewood are cut and exported. The manufactures are salt, s\u00e1ris, or robes for women, coarse cloth turbans, and coir rope. Paper is made in Janjir\u00e1 fort. Recently, small pearls were found in oysters fished up from the R\u00e1jpuri creek. The oyster is believed to be the Placuna placenta. Judging from the quantities of shells thrown up along the banks of the R\u00e1jpuri creek, the beds must be considerable.\n\nExcept the plots of rich alluvial rice land in the valleys, and some sandy tracts near the coast, the usual red stony soil of the Konk\u00e1n prevails throughout Janjir\u00e1. For irrigation purposes, water sufficiently fresh is found everywhere by digging a few yards into the easily worked earth. It is drawn from wells by means of the Persian wheel, and from streams by a balance-lift called upti. In the strip of light sand bordering the sea-coast, cocoa-nut trees grow in great perfection.\nQuarries of trap and laterite are occasionally worked. The State has for some years been a chief source of supply of firewood to Bombay city; but its forests have been consequently over-cut, and the necessity of conserving them has engaged the attention of the Government of Bombay.\n\nThere are 25 schools, 14 being Mar\u00e1th\u00e1, and 11 Muhammadan. The number of pupils are 816 and 558 respectively. In the 3 girls' schools 141 attended\u201457 Muhammadans and 84 Hindus. There is a dispensary.\n\nCommunications.\u2014External traffic is carried on almost entirely by water. In March 1874, a regular tri-weekly steam communication was established between Bombay and D\u00e1sg\u00f3on, on the S\u00e1vitri river, touching at Janjir\u00e1 and Shriwardhan. A State post is worked from Alib\u00e1gh to B\u00e1nkot. There are 12 ferries in the State. A ferry steamer plies between Bombay and Dharamtar. The only made roads are one from Murud to Borli, 14 miles in length, and another from Dighi to Shriwardhan, 19 miles.\n\nHistory.\u2014The chief is a Sunn\u00ed Muhammadan, by race a Sidi or Abyssinian, with the title of Naw\u00e1b. The last chief, Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Kh\u00e1n Y\u00e1kut Kh\u00e1n, died in 1879. The Naw\u00e1b has no sanad authorizing adoption, and pays no tribute. As regards succession, the eldest son does not, as of right, succeed to the throne; but that one among the sons who is decided by the supreme authority in the State to be fittest to rule. Till 1868, the State enjoyed singular independence, there being no Political Agent, and no interference whatever in its internal affairs. About that year, the mal-administration of the chief, especially in matters of police and criminal justice, became flagrant; those branches of administration were in consequence taken out of his hands, and vested in a Political Agent. The Treaty, which regulates the dealings of the British Government with the Naw\u00e1b, is that of 1870. The name Janjir\u00e1 is corrupted from the Arabic jazirah, 'an island.' The origin of the ruling family is thus related:\u2014About the year 1489 A.D., an Abyssinian in the service of one of the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi kings of Ahmednagar, disguised as a merchant, obtained permission from the chiefs of the island to land 300 boxes. Each of these boxes contained a soldier, and by this means the Abyssinians possessed themselves of Janjir\u00e1 island and the fort of Dand\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1pur. The island afterwards formed part of the dominions of the King of Bij\u00e1pur. In the time of Sivaji, the government of the Southern Konk\u00e1n was held by the Admiral of the Bij\u00e1pur fleet, who was always an Abyssinian. In consequence of harsh treatment at the hands of his master, the Sidi Admiral offered his services, in 1660, to the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. The most noticeable point in the history of Janjir\u00e1, is its successful resistance, alone of all the States of\nWestern India, to the determined attacks of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who made its capture a point of honour. After repeated attacks by Sivaji, its conquest was again attempted in 1682 by his son Sambaj\u00ed, who besieged the island, which he attempted to connect with the mainland by means of a mole. The project failed, and other attempted modes of attack were defeated with heavy loss. The State maintains a force of 700 men for garrison and police duties. The Naw\u00e1b of Janjir\u00e1 is entitled to a salute of nine guns. The small State of J\u00e1far\u00e1b\u00e1d in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r is also governed by this family.\n\n**Janjir\u00e1.**\u2014Town and fort of Janjir\u00e1 State, in the Konk\u00e1n, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 18\u00b0 18' N., long. 73\u00b0 E.; 44 miles south of Bombay. Population (1881) 1784. The fort of Janjir\u00e1, on an island at the entrance of the R\u00e1jpuri creek, lies half a mile from the mainland on the east, and a mile from the mainland on the west. The walls of the fort rise abruptly from the water to a height of 50 feet. The walls are battlemented and loopholed. In the bastions and on the walls are ten guns. In the fort a yearly Muhammadan fair is held in November, attended by about 3000 visitors. On N\u00e1nwell headland, about two miles west of the fort, a lighthouse is being erected. A dioptic light of the fourth order will stand on a tower of about 150 feet about sea-level. It will serve to light the dangerous sunken reef known as the Chor K\u00e1ssa, situated about three-quarters of a mile from the headland.\n\n**J\u00e1nsath.**\u2014South-eastern tahsil of Muzaffarnagar District, North-Western Provinces, lying between the Ganges and the Hindan, traversed by the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway, and watered by the Ganges Canal. It comprises the four pargan\u00e1s of Jauli J\u00e1nsath, Khatauli, Bhukarheri, and Bhum\u00e1 Sambhalheri. Area, 453 square miles, of which 287 are cultivated. Population (1872) 161,927; (1881) 183,854, namely, males 98,677, and females 85,177. Increase of population in the nine years, 21,927, or 11.9 per cent. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 120,509; Muhammadans, 51,944; Jains, 2316; and \u2018others,\u2019 85. Of the 241 villages which comprise the tahsil, 121 have less than five hundred inhabitants; 75 from five hundred to a thousand; 27 from one to two thousand; 11 from two to three thousand; and 7 from three to five thousand inhabitants. Total Government revenue, including cesses, \u00a323,531; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a365,131. The tahsil, which in civil matters is within the jurisdiction of the munsif of Muzaffarnagar, contains 3 criminal courts, that of a deputy magistrate or tahsild\u00e1r, and those of 2 honorary magistrates. For police purposes, the tahsil is divided into the four police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of J\u00e1nsath, Bhopa, Miranpur, and Khatauli. Strength of regular police, 49 officers and men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 374.\nJ\u00e1nsath.\u2014Town in Muzaffarnagar District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of J\u00e1nsath tahsil. Lat. 29\u00b0 19' 15\" N., long. 77\u00b0 53' 20\" E. Situated on a low part of the plain, 14 miles south-east of Muzaffarnagar town. Famous as the home of the J\u00e1nsath Sayyids, who held all the chief offices of the Delhi Empire in the early part of the 18th century. J\u00e1nsath was sacked and destroyed by a Rohill\u00e1 force, under orders from the Waz\u00edr Kamar-ud-d\u00edn, in 1737, and most of the Sayyids were slain or exiled; but some of their descendants still inhabit the town. Population (1881) 6284, namely, Hindus, 3354; Muhammadans, 2839; and Jains, 91. Area of town site, 70 acres. A small municipal revenue for police and conservancy purposes is raised under the provisions of the Chauk\u00edd\u00e1ri Act. Police station, post-office, school.\n\nJ\u00e1oli.\u2014Sub-division of Sat\u00e1ra District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See JAVLI.\n\nJ\u00e1ora.\u2014Native State under the Western M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Agency, Central India. The territory of the J\u00e1ora State consists of two principal tracts. The larger tract lies between lat. 23\u00b0 32' and 23\u00b0 55' N., and between long. 74\u00b0 52' and 75\u00b0 32' E.; the smaller tract lies between lat. 24\u00b0 10' and 24\u00b0 20' N., and long. 75\u00b0 10' and 75\u00b0 25' E. The area of the whole is 872 square miles. Population (1881) 108,434, namely, 57,245 males and 51,189 females; Hindus numbered 87,833, Muhammadans 13,318, Jains 2010, P\u00e1rs\u00eds 12, Christians 3, and aboriginal tribes 5258. Revenue of the State (1881), \u00a379,930.\n\nThe lands of this chiefship were originally assigned by Holkar to the Path\u00e1n adventurer Am\u00edr Kh\u00e1n, for support of troops to aid his schemes of aggrandizement in Northern India. Am\u00edr Kh\u00e1n's brother-in-law, Gaf\u00far Kh\u00e1n, being in occupation when the battle of Mehidpur decided the fate of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 in 1818, the possession of J\u00e1ora was secured to him and his heirs by the British Government. The present Naw\u00e1b of J\u00e1ora, who succeeded in 1865, is Muhammad Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, by race a Path\u00e1n. His residence is at J\u00e1ora. Though nominally a feudatory of Holkar, and liable to the payment of a succession nazar\u00e1na of 2 l\u00f3khs (\u00a320,000), the Naw\u00e1b is directly under the protection and political control of the British Government. He holds a sanad guaranteeing the succession according to Muhammadan law, in the event of failure of natural heirs. J\u00e1ora State contains the best poppy-growing lands in M\u00e1lw\u00e1, and silver mines are said to have formerly been worked. The Naw\u00e1b keeps up a military force of 15 guns, with 69 gunners; cavalry, 121; regular infantry, 200; and irregular foot levies, 200: police, 497. His services during the Mutiny were rewarded by an increase to his salute of 13 guns, and by a reduction in his annual contribution to the Contingent, now fixed at \u00a316,181. The R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 State Railway passes through the State.\nJ\u00e1ora.\u2014Chief town of the State of J\u00e1ora, under the Western M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Agency of Central India, and a station of the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 State Railway. Lat. 23\u00b0 37' N., long. 75\u00b0 8' E. The town contains (1881) 4400 houses, and a population of 19,902, namely, 10,336 males and 9566 females; Hindus numbered 10,547, Muhammadans 8892, and 'others' 463. It was formerly the residence of a Th\u00e1kur, whose family still exists here in the enjoyment of a pension. The present town was laid out by Colonel Borthwick in regular streets, and boasts one of the most beautiful stone bridges in Central India, built by him. The houses and shops are substantial; the town is surrounded by a stone wall not yet completed. A fair amount of trade is carried on, and the town is connected by railway with Ratl\u00e1m (20 miles) on the south and Part\u00e1bgarh (32 miles) on the north. It contains an opium-weighing depot, post and telegraph offices, school, and dispensary. Elevation, 1450 feet. The small river Piria, on which the town is situated, becomes a torrent in the rainy season.\n\nJ\u00e1rcha (Jh\u00e1rcha).\u2014Town in Sikandar\u00e1b\u00e1d tahs\u00edl, Bulandshahr District, situated 8 miles north of Sikandar\u00e1b\u00e1d, 7 miles east of D\u00e1dri, and 20 miles north-west of Bulandshahr town. The population (3776 in 1881) consists chiefly of Sayyids, styled Sabzw\u00e1ri, who claim descent from the Sayyids of Sabzw\u00e1r in Turkist\u00e1n, whence they came during the reign of the Tughlak dynasty. The correct name of the town is said to be Ch\u00e1r Ch\u00e1h, or 'the four wells,' because four wells were sunk here by the founder of the town, Sayyid Zain-ul-abd\u00edn, who obtained a revenue-free grant of 3500 bigh\u00e1s from the Emperor Mub\u00e1rak Sh\u00e1h, on condition of ousting the Mew\u00e1t\u00eds. The four wells are still to be seen, and the descendants of the founder continued in enjoyment of the grant until 1857, when they took part in the plunder of Sikandar\u00e1b\u00e1d, and their holdings were confiscated. The village was then sold by auction. It realized \u00a317,800, and passed into the possession of a Hindu family. The town is famous for the number and excellence of its mango trees. Weekly market on Wednesdays; police station, and school. For police and conservancy purposes, a small house-tax is levied under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856. The Ganges Canal runs about a mile north of the town.\n\nJ\u00e1rod.\u2014Sub-division of Baroda (the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r's territory), Bombay Presidency. Area, 350 square miles. Bounded on the north by the Rewa K\u00e1ntha Agency; west by Baroda Sub-division; south by Dabhoi Sub-division; east by H\u00e1lol District. Acres under cultivation, 28,894; waste, 23,725 acres; cultivable waste, 96,210. Population (1872) 65,225. No later population statistics are available. The Sub-division consists of a well-wooded plain, intersected by the Visw\u00e1mitri, Surya, and Jambva rivers. The soil is either black or gor\u00e1t (yellow). Number of holdings (of from 1\u00bd to 15\u00bd acres), 4300. Cotton, b\u00e1jra, and jo\u00e1r\nare the staple crops. Savali (population in 1881, 6275) is the headquarters of the Sub-division.\n\n**Jarw\u00e1l.**\u2014Town in Bahr\u00e1ich District, Oudh; on the road from Bahramgh\u00e1t to Bahr\u00e1ich, 5\u00bd miles from the former and 29 from the latter town. Lat. 27\u00b0 10' 9\" N., long. 81\u00b0 35' 33\" E. A Muhammadan town, captured from the Bhars in 1340 A.D., by a Sayyid chief, whose descendants still reside here. Their influence has of late much decreased, and a considerable portion of their ancestral estates has passed into the possession of R\u00e1jput neighbours. Population (1869) 1908; (1881) 4187. Bi-weekly market for the sale of grain, cloth, and brass vessels. Manufactures\u2014fireworks, dyes, saltpetre, scents, and felts, the latter being a speciality of Bahr\u00e1ich District. Two Hindu temples, 4 mosques, rest-house (sar\u00e1i), Government school.\n\n**Jasd\u00e1n.**\u2014Native State of the Gohelw\u00e1r Division of the Political Agency of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Province of Gujar\u00e1t (Guz\u00e9r\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency. Area, 283 square miles. Population (1872) 30,134; (1881) 29,037; number of villages, 62; estimated gross revenue, \u00a314,500. Products, cotton and grain. Jasd\u00e1n ranks as a third-class State among the many petty States of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. Its ruler entered into engagements with the British Government in 1807. The chief of Jasd\u00e1n pays to the British Government, the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh, an aggregate tribute of \u00a31066, and maintains a military force of 341 men. He holds no sanad of adoption, but the succession follows the rule of equal division of property between the brothers, with extra allowance ('moht\u00e1d'), to the eldest. The State has (1882) 6 schools, with 382 pupils. The police consists of 60 mounted and 348 foot, with 500 p\u00e1saitas. Dispensary.\n\n**Jasd\u00e1n.**\u2014Chief town of Jasd\u00e1n 'State, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; situated in lat. 22\u00b0 5' N., long. 71\u00b0 20' E., about 4 miles north-east of Adkot, and 6 miles north of Kotra Pitha, both of which are on the R\u00e1jkot-Bhawnagar high-road. Jasd\u00e1n is a town of great antiquity, and possibly derives its name from Sw\u00e1mi Chashtana, one of the very earliest of the Kshatrapa dynasty. During the reign of the Ghor\u00eds of Jun\u00e1garh a strong fort was built here, and the town was called Ghorgarh. A good road connects it with Vinchia, which it is proposed ultimately to connect with the railway at Bot\u00e1d. Population (1872) 3663; (1881) 3873. School and dispensary.\n\n**Jashpur.**\u2014Petty State of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 17' 5\" to 23\u00b0 15' 30\" N., long. 83\u00b0 32' 50\" to 84\u00b0 26' 15\" E. Area, 1963 square miles. Population (1881) 90,240. Bounded on the north and west by the State of Sarg\u00faj\u00e1; on the south by G\u00e1ngpur and Udaipur; and on the east by Loh\u00e1rdag\u00e1 District.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The State of Jashpur consists in almost equal\nproportions of highland and lowland areas. On its eastern side, the table-land of the Upargh\u00e1t (2200 feet above the sea) blends with and forms an integral part of the plateau of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur; towards the west, it springs abruptly from the Hetgh\u00e1t, with a wall buttressed at places by projecting masses of rock. The lowlands of Hetgh\u00e1t and of Jashpur proper lie to the south in successive steppes, broken by low hills, gneiss rocks, and isolated bluffs. A slight depression separates the Upargh\u00e1t from the still loftier plateau of the Khuri\u00e1 (3000 to 3700 feet), which occupies the north-west corner of the State, forming the watershed between the Ib and the Kanhar, a tributary of the Son (Soane). This plateau consists of trap rock topped with volcanic laterite, overlying the granite and gneiss which form the surface rocks at lower elevations. It has been extensively denuded by the waters of the Ib, Kanhar, and Lowa, and their tributaries, which have hollowed out valleys generally lying about 1000 feet below the level of the plateau. The result is that the numerous sections which have been surrounded by the rivers, and thus cut off from the main plateau, stand out like islands rising above the surrounding valleys. The Pandrapat, which forms the western and highest part of the plateau, covers about 150 square miles. It is well wooded, and watered by streams running in wide valleys, bounded by gently sloping hills. The soil on the plateau is excellent, and the climate exceedingly healthy, with a height of about 3500 feet above sea-level. The volcanic laterite which forms the surface soil of the Khuri\u00e1 plateau also occurs on the Upargh\u00e1t and part of the Hetgh\u00e1t, but the trap does not appear except on the Khuri\u00e1 plateau and its outlying sections. The principal heights in Jashpur are R\u00e1n\u00edjul\u00e1 (3527 feet), Kohiar (3393 feet), Bharamurio (3390 feet). The chief river is the Ib, which flows through the State from north to south; but numerous rapids render it unnavigable. The small rivers to the north are feeders of the Kanhar. Iron and gold are found in Jashpur; s\u00e1l, sis\u00ed, ebony, and other valuable timber abound along the course of the Ib. Jungle products\u2014lac, tasar silk, and beeswax.\n\nHistory.\u2014Jashpur, with the rest of the Sarg\u00faj\u00e1 group of States, was ceded to the British Government by the provisional engagement concluded with Madhuji Bhonsla (Ap\u00e1 Sahib) in 1818. Although noticed in the second article of this agreement as a separate estate, Jashpur was at first treated in some measure as a fief of Sarg\u00faj\u00e1, through which State it still pays tribute; in every other respect it is dealt with as a distinct territory. The chief of Jashpur renders no feudal service to Sarg\u00faj\u00e1; his annual income is about \u00a31200; the tribute to Government, \u00a377, 10s.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The total population of Jashpur State in 1881 numbered 90,240 persons, being 45,999 males and 42,241 females; density of\npopulation, 46 per square mile. Classified according to religion, the population consists of 89,696 Hindus and 544 Muhammadans. The Census of 1881 does not give any ethical classification, but the great majority of the inhabitants are Dravidian and Kolarian aborigines, who in 1872 formed upwards of 82 per cent. of the population of the State. The principal aboriginal tribes are the Ur\u00e1ons, Rautias, and Korw\u00e1s. The residence of the R\u00e1ja is at Jagdispur or Jashpurnagar.\n\nCrops.\u2014Cereals, oil-seeds, fibres, and cotton.\n\nJashpur.\u2014Hill range in Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Bengal. The principal peaks are\u2014R\u00e1n\u00edjul\u00e1, 3527 feet in height, lat. 22\u00b0 59' 45\" N., long. 83\u00b0 38' E.; Kohiar, 3393 feet; Bharumurio, 3390 feet; Chipli, 3300 feet; Laiongbir, 3293; Bhusrunga, 3285 feet; Talora, 3258 feet; Dulum, 3248 feet; Garh, 3226; Dhasma, 3222 feet, etc.\n\nJaso.\u2014Petty State in Bundelkhand, under the Central India Agency, situated between lat. 24\u00b0 20' and 24\u00b0 34' N., and between long. 80\u00b0 28' and 80\u00b0 40' 30\" E. The present (1883) chief, Diw\u00e1n Gujr\u00e1j Singh, is a Hindu Bundela. Area of State, 75 square miles, with 57 villages and 1775 houses. Population (1881) 8050, namely, males 4022, and females 4028. Hindus numbered 7142; Muhammadans, 121; Jains, 18; and aboriginal tribes still professing their primitive faiths, 769. Revenue (1875), \u00a31400. The chief keeps up a military force of 2 guns and about 50 horsemen. He holds a sanad, giving the right of adoption. The town of Jaso is in lat. 24\u00b0 27' N., and long. 80\u00b0 35' E.\n\nJasol.\u2014J\u00e1gir estate and village in the District of Mall\u00e1ni, Jodhpur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. The estate comprises 72 villages, and an annual tribute of \u00a3210 is paid to Jodhpur State. The high hill known as Nagar of Jasol is in this estate. It is the loftiest point of a small ridge which trends in a south-western direction for about three miles; the ascent to it is about a mile and a quarter in length; on the top are reservoirs for water. The village of Jasol lies near the left bank of the Lum\u00ed river, in lat. 25\u00b0 8' N., and long. 72\u00b0 21' E., 60 miles south-west of Jodhpur city. The village, which is built at the northern base of a conical hill, contains a bungalow for the accommodation of the political superintendent when on tour, and for European gentlemen when travelling through the State.\n\nJaspur.\u2014Town in the Tar\u00e1i District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 29\u00b0 16' 45\" N., long. 78\u00b0 52' 30\" E. Population (1872) 6746; (1881) 7055, namely, Hindus, 4225; Muhammadans, 2796; and Jains, 34. Area of town site, 494 acres. A house-tax for police and conservancy purposes is levied under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856.\n\nJaspura.\u2014Village in B\u00e1nda District, North-Western Provinces; 17 miles north of B\u00e1nda town. Population (1881) 1772. The neighbouring fort of Abhaipur was founded by a robber chieftain, Hum\u00e1yun, who\ngathered a body of followers during the 18th century, and took the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1. He diverted the waters of the Ken into an artificial channel, which supplies a valuable means of irrigation at the present day.\n\n**Jasrota.**\u2014Extinct principality and town in Kashmir State, Punjab, Northern India; situated in lat. $32^\\circ 29'$ N., and long. $75^\\circ 27'$ E., among the mountains of the southern Himalayan chain. The last R\u00e1j\u00e1 was dispossessed by Ranj\u00edt Singh. Thornton describes the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s residence as a handsome palace with four towers. Small b\u00e1z\u00e1r and inconsiderable trade.\n\n**Jasw\u00e1n D\u00fan.**\u2014Valley in Hoshi\u00e1rpur District, Punjab, intervening between the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk Hills and the outer Himalayan range. It corresponds to the Dehra D\u00fan in the Gangetic Do\u00e1b, and the Khi\u00e1rda D\u00fan in N\u00e1han State. The So\u00e1n torrent traverses its whole length, and its sandy bed is one or two miles wide. Spurs from the neighbouring hills project into the central dale from either range, but there is a wide stretch of comparatively level and open ground, with a breadth of from 4 to 14 miles. Elevation of the town of Una, situated about the middle of the D\u00fan, 1404 feet above the sea. This valley formed the principal part of the ancient R\u00e1jput principality of Jasw\u00e1n, and gives its name to the tribe of Jasw\u00e1l R\u00e1jputs, which is nearly allied to the royal Katoch house of Kangra.\n\n**Jaswantnagar.**\u2014Town in Etawah District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. $26^\\circ 52' 50''$ N., long. $78^\\circ 56' 30''$ E. Situated on the East Indian Railway, 10 miles north-west of Etawah town. Population (1872) 5310; (1881) 4950, namely, Hindus, 3536; and Muhammadans, 1414. Named after Jaswant R\u00e1i, a M\u00e1n\u00edpuri K\u00e1yasth, who settled in the town in 1715. Handsome houses of the wealthier merchants. Fine tank, with temple and bathing gh\u00e1ts built by a rich mah\u00e1jan. Place of worship of the Saraugis, who form a considerable element in the population. A small Hindu temple west of the town was occupied on May 19, 1857, by mutineers of the 3rd Native Cavalry; during a bold attempt to dislodge them, the Joint Magistrate was wounded in the face. Considerable trade in yarn, cattle, and country produce, as well as English piece-goods. Exports of indigo and gh\u00ed, manufacture of native cloth. Railway station, first-class police station, and good school. The Chaukhid\u00e1ri Act (xx. of 1856) is in force in the town, and yielded an income of \u00a3274 in 1881\u201382.\n\n**Jath.**\u2014Native State under the Political Agency of Sat\u00e1ra, Sat\u00e1ra District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. $16^\\circ 50'$ to $17^\\circ 18'$ N., and long. $75^\\circ 1'$ to $75^\\circ 31'$ E. Area, 884 square miles. Population (1881) 49,486; density of population, 55.9 per square mile. Hindus numbered 46,427; Muhammadans, 2842; and \u2018others,\u2019 217. Number of villages, 110; occupied houses, 7935; unoccupied houses, 1286; estimated gross revenue\n(excluding alienations amounting to \u00a34500), \u00a312,500. Since 1872 the population has decreased by 14,514, or 23 per cent. The land is poor, especially in the west; but in the centre of the State, and along the Bor river in the east, the soil is richer. Cultivation is neglected, and there has been little attempt at irrigation. Cattle-breeding is more remunerative, the weekly market at the town of Jath serving as a centre of exchange for the surrounding country. The staple products are bajra and jo\u00e1r. Cotton, wheat, gram, and safflower are also grown. There are in the Jath State 17 schools, with 682 pupils; charitable dispensary. The police force consists of 64 men; there are 4 criminal courts. A municipal fund is raised by a tax on the sale of cattle at the weekly market at Jath. The chief is a Hindu (Mar\u00e1th\u00e1) of the Kshattriya caste, and his titles are Deshmukh and J\u00e1gird\u00e1r of Jath. He ranks as a first-class Sard\u00e1r in the Deccan. He holds a sanad of adoption, and the succession follows the rule of primogeniture. Owing to mismanagement on the part of the chief, the State has been under attachment since April 1874, and the administration is still (1884) conducted by a British officer, known as the Political Agent, Sat\u00e1ra. The State had been several times previously attached, but is now prosperous. It pays to the British Government \u00a3640 per annum, in lieu of the service of 50 horsemen, and a tribute (Sir Deshmukhi) of \u00a3484. It also pays \u00a395 to the Panth Pratinidhi J\u00e1gird\u00e1r of Aundh. Jath is one of the feudatories of the old Sat\u00e1ra R\u00e1j.\u2014See Daflapur.\n\n**Jath.**\u2014Chief town of Jath State in Sat\u00e1ra District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 17\u00b0 3' N., long. 75\u00b0 16' E.; 92 miles south-east of Sat\u00e1ra town, 95 miles north-east of Belg\u00e1um, and 150 miles south-east by south of Poona. Population (1881) 5036.\n\n**J\u00e1t\u00ed.**\u2014Tiluk of the Sh\u00e1hbandar Sub-division, Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 23\u00b0 33' 30\" to 24\u00b0 36' N., and long. 68\u00b0 0' 30\" to 68\u00b0 48' 15\" E. Area, 2145 square miles, with 4 tap\u00e1s, 95 villages, and 5357 houses. Population (1881) 27,055, namely, 14,798 males and 12,257 females. Muhammadans numbered 24,212; Hindus, 2447; Sikhs, 309; and aboriginal tribes, 87. Revenue (1881\u201382), \u00a36270, of which \u00a35896 was derived from imperial and \u00a3374 from local sources. Of the 1,314,020 acres in the tiluk in 1876, 28,915 were under cultivation, 33,503 cultivable, and the remainder uncultivable waste. The tiluk contains 2 criminal courts, 5 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), and 32 regular police.\n\n**Jating\u00e1.**\u2014River in the north of Cachar District, Assam; which rises amid the Bar\u00e1il Hills, and flows south past the village of Barkhol\u00e1 into the Bar\u00e1k, a few miles below Silch\u00e1r. The road to the sub-divi-sional station of Gunjong lies up the valley of this river.\n\n**Jatoi.**\u2014Town and municipality in Al\u00edpur tahsil, Muzaffargarh District, Punjab. Lat. 29\u00b0 30' 45\" N., long. 70\u00b0 53' E.; distant from\nAlipur 11 miles north-west. Local tradition attributes its foundation to M\u00edr Baj\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n, in the days of the Emperor B\u00e1bar. The Indus washed away the original town at the close of the last century, but it was shortly afterwards rebuilt on the present site. Jatoi was for some time subordinate to Bah\u00e1walpur, but was annexed by Diw\u00e1n Sawan Mall. In the war against Mulr\u00e1j, the Jatoi people threw off the Sikh rule, and rendered good service in the Mult\u00e1n (Mooltan) campaign. Population (1881) 2035, namely, Muhammadans, 1080; Hindus, 945; and Sikhs, 10. Number of houses, 366. Municipal revenue in 1882-83, \u00a3170. Police station, school-house, post-office.\n\n**Jatoi.** \u2014 Village in the Moro t\u00e1luk of Naushahro Sub-division, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 26\u00b0 30' 20\" N., long. 68\u00b0 3' 10\" E. Jatoi lies on the right bank of the D\u00e1dwah, 11 miles south-east of Moro, the head-quarters of the t\u00e1luk. Population (1872) 892, mostly agriculturists: population not returned for 1881. Export trade in grain, annual value, \u00a3600. Founded in 1780.\n\n**Jatr\u00e1pur.** \u2014 Trading village in Rangpur District, Bengal; near the river Dharla. Lat. 25\u00b0 49' N., long. 89\u00b0 47' 15\" E. Exports, jute and mustard-seed.\n\n**Jatt\u00e1.** \u2014 Important Government salt-mine in Koh\u00e1t District, Punjab, in the chain of hills known as the Koh\u00e1t Salt Range. Lies on the north side of the Ter\u00ed Toi river, 9 miles west of Malgin mine. The salt occurs as solid rock, and is quarried by blasting over an area of one mile by one mile and a half. Only bullocks and donkeys are ordinarily laden here, camels being occasionally prohibited in order to prevent overcrowding at this mine, the nearest of the five situated in the same range. The protective establishment comprises 23 men. The head-quarters of the salt-mines are at Jatt\u00e1. Quantity extracted in 1881-82 (at Jatt\u00e1 mine), 139,289 maunds; amount of duty, \u00a33482. Annual average gross income for the eight years ending 1882, \u00a33103.\n\n**J\u00e1ulna.** \u2014 Town in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d), Nizam\u2019s territory, Deccan, Central India.\u2014See Jalna.\n\n**Jaum.** \u2014 Village and fort in Indore State, Central India. Lat. 22\u00b0 22' N., long. 75\u00b0 47' E.; 14 miles south of Mau (Mhow), and 100 north-west of As\u00edrgarh. Jaum is situated on the summit of a pass in the Vindhy\u00e1 range that is practicable for wheeled carriages; 2328 feet above sea-level.\n\n**Jaunpur.** \u2014 District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 25\u00b0 23' 45\" and 26\u00b0 12' N. lat., and between 82\u00b0 10' and 83\u00b0 7' 45\" E. long. Jaunpur is the north-eastern District of the Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d Division. In shape it is an irregular triangle, with the southern boundary as its base, and the eastern\nand western boundaries running up to an apex in the north. The adjacent Districts forming the boundaries are\u2014on the north-west and north, the Oudh Districts of Part\u00e1bgarh and Sult\u00e1npur; on the north-east, Azamgarh; on the east, Gh\u00e1zipur; and on the south and south-west, Benares, M\u00edrzapur, and Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. A small portion of the District is isolated from the remainder by an intrusive belt of Oudh territory in Part\u00e1bgarh District; while a portion of Part\u00e1bgarh almost equal in area to this outlying tract is imbedded in the Machhl\u00edshahr tal\u00eds\u00edl of Jaunpur. Area, 1554 square miles; population (1881) 1,209,663 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of JAUNPUR.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Jaunpur forms part of the wide Gangetic plain, and its surface is composed of a thick alluvial deposit, brought down by the great rivers which flow from the Him\u00e1layan range. It differs, however, from the typical plain regions in the slight irregularity of its contour, which is worn down into undulating slopes by the action of minor streams. This apparent diversity of surface is increased by the occurrence of lofty mounds, often covered with groves, which mark the sites of ruined or deserted towns, the relics of a forgotten race, or of the demolished forts of the present R\u00e1jput inhabitants. The general slope of the country is from north-west to south-east, and probably does not exceed an average of 6 inches per mile. The prevailing soils are d\u00edmat or loam, matiy\u00e1r or clay, and balu\u00e1 or sand, in all of which vegetable mould, clay, and sand are found in varying proportions. Kar\u00e1il, a dark alluvial mould answering to the m\u00e1r of Bundelkhand, is found in places marking the former sites of jhilks, or in old river-beds. Occasionally may be seen a patch of \u00fasar, rendered barren by the white saline efflorescence known as reh; but with this exception the whole District is closely tilled, and no waste lands break the continuous prospect of cultivated fields. The northern and central portions are richly wooded with the thick foliage of the mango, or with isolated clumps of mahu\u00e1 and tamarind trees.\n\nThe District is divided into two unequal parts by the sinuous channel of the G\u00famti, a tributary of the Ganges, which flows past the city of Jaunpur, and cuts off one-third of the area to the north-east. Its total course within the District is about 90 miles, and it is nowhere fordable. At Jaunpur it is traversed by the famous Muhammadan bridge built by Mun'im Kh\u00e1n in 1569\u201373, consisting of 16 arches, with a total span of 712 feet. Two miles lower down, it is again crossed by the modern railway bridge on the Oudh and Rohilkhand line, which has the same number of arches, but double the span of the older work. The channel of the G\u00famti is deep and well defined, while the hardness of the nodular limestone through which it has slowly eaten its way effectually prevents those constant shifting which give rise to endless riparian\ndisputes in the wider valleys of the great arterial streams. The G\u00famti is liable to great and sudden floods. In September 1871, the stream rose $23\\frac{1}{2}$ feet in fourteen days, and was 37 feet above its dry season level. The ordinary rise of the G\u00famti is seldom over 15 feet. The other rivers of the District are the Sai, the Barna, the Pilli, and the Basohi. Lakes are numerous in the north and south, though rare in the central pargan\u00e1s; the largest has a length of about eight miles. There is at present (1884) no canal in the District; but the northern and southern Jaunpur branches of the proposed S\u00e1rda canal will, if completed, irrigate its western half, and fall into the G\u00famti near Jaunpur town.\n\nThe largest jungle tract is a small dh\u00edk forest in Kar\u00e1kat tahs\u00edl, with an area of about 2000 acres, although towards the end of the 18th century there were large forest tracts in Kh\u00fat\u00e1han tahs\u00edl. These have entirely disappeared as population has increased and cultivation been extended. Of waste lands there are practically none, save the occasional patches of \u00fasar mentioned above. Kankar or nodular limestone, used for road metalling or manufactured into lime, is found in all the upland parts of the District.\n\nOwing to the density of the population and the absence of forests or waste lands, wild animals are scarce, and the waterfowl of the marshy lakes form the only attraction for the sportsman. But cobras and other snakes are common, while packs of wolves frequent the scanty ravines which border the G\u00famti and the Sai.\n\nHistory.\u2014In the earliest times, Jaunpur was held by the Bhars, a tribe of non-Aryan aborigines, who occupied the whole northern slope of the central Ganges plain. Few traces of their long settlement in this District can now be recovered. Along the banks of the Barna, frequent mounds conceal the sites of large cities destroyed by fire; but these were probably overthrown in the 9th century of our era, when the great Br\u00e1hmanist revival finally triumphed over Buddhism, and the faith of Sakya Muni was trampled out with flame and sword throughout all Upper India. Vast temples also stood at one time by the side of the G\u00famti, and some portions of their architecture have survived the devastation of the earliest Musalm\u00e1n invaders; yet nothing is known with certainty of their age or founders. The fort of F\u00edroz, built about the year 1360, was almost entirely constructed from ruined temples of Buddhist or Hindu origin, and carved stones taken from the infidel buildings abound in the walls. Doubtless, in prehistoric times Jaunpur formed a portion of the Ajodhya principality; and when it first makes an appearance in authentic history, it was subject to the rulers of Benares. With the rest of their dominions it fell under the yoke of the Musalm\u00e1n marauders after the victory gained by Sh\u00e1hab-ud-d\u00edn over the Hindu champion Jai Chand, in 1194 A.D.\n\nFrom this time the tract now forming the District of Jaunpur\nappears to have been ruled by a prince of the Kanauj dynasty, as a tributary of the Muhammadan suzerain. In 1360, Firoz Tughlak, on his return from an expedition to Bengal, encamped at Jaunpur, and, being struck with the advantages of its site, determined to build a city on the spot. He remained there for six months, and demolished one Hindu temple; but the stout resistance of the populace compelled him to refrain from his attempt to level another, the votive offering of Jai Chand. At a later date, however, it was destroyed by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Salt\u00e1n of Jaunpur, who employed the stones to construct the mosque known as the Atala Masjid. In 1388, Malik Sarwar Khw\u00e1ja, a eunuch who had become Waz\u00edr at Delhi, was sent by Muhammad Tughlak to govern the eastern Province, which extended from Kanauj to Behar. The ambitious eunuch fixed his residence at Jaunpur; and in 1394, taking advantage of Tim\u00far's invasion, he made himself independent of the Delhi court, and assumed the title of Sult\u00e1n-us-Shark, or Eastern Emperor.\n\nFor nearly a century, the Sharki dynasty ruled at Jaunpur, and proved formidable rivals to the sovereigns of Delhi. They possessed the greater part of Hindust\u00e1n, and were engaged in one long struggle with their former masters for the supremacy of the whole. The founder of the dynasty, who died in 1400, left his dominions to his adopted son Mub\u00e1rak Kh\u00e1n. The new Sult\u00e1n reigned only for a single year, and died in 1401, while resisting an attack of the Delhi forces at Kanauj. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, the builder of the Atala Masjid. Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm's life was spent in a long contest for the recovery of Kanauj, which he was obliged to cede in the earlier years of his reign, and for the conquest of Kalpi, which he twice unsuccessfully attacked. He died in 1440. His son, M\u00e1hm\u00fad, was more aggressive. In 1442 he took Kalpi, and ten years later marched upon Delhi, to which he laid siege. Bahlol Lodi, the real ruler of the Empire under the fain\u00e9ant Emperor Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, returned from the Punjab, raised the siege, and utterly defeated Mahm\u00fad. The last of the dynasty was Sult\u00e1n Hassan, who passed his life in a fierce and chequered struggle for supremacy with Bahlol, then actual Emperor at Delhi. At length, in 1478, Bahlol succeeded in defeating his rival in a series of decisive engagements. He took the city of Jaunpur, but permitted the conquered Hassan to reside there, and to complete the building of his great mosque, the Jam\u00e1 Masjid, which forms the chief ornament of the town at the present day. Many other architectural works in the District still bear witness to its former greatness under its independent Musalm\u00e1n rulers. In spite of such unwonted clemency, Hassan more than once rebelled, and died an insurgent in 1495.\n\nUnder the Lodi dynasty the history of Jaunpur contains nothing more than the stereotyped narrative of provincial intrigue, constant revolt,\nand bloody repression. When Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, the last of that line, was defeated and killed at P\u00e1n\u00edpat by B\u00e1bar in 1526, Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, the governor of Jaunpur, asserted his independence; and for a short time a local kingdom was once more established in the District. But after the fall of Agra and Delhi, B\u00e1bar sent his son Hum\u00e1y\u00fan eastward for the recovery of Jaunpur and Behar. Thenceforward the District formed a portion of the Mughal Empire, except during the brief interposition of Sher Sh\u00e1h and his family. In 1575, Akbar removed the viceregal court for the eastern Provinces to his newly-founded city and fort of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d; and Jaunpur was governed from that time by a Niz\u00e1m. Nothing worthy of note occurred in connection with this District until 1722, when it was transferred, with Benares, Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur, and Chan\u00e1r, from the viceroyalty of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d and the direct sway of the Delhi Empire to the hands of the Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edr of Oudh. The latter appointed Balwant Singh to the government of these Districts, with the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Benares. In 1750, when the Rohill\u00e1 leader, Sayyid Ahmad Bangash, defeated the Waz\u00edr Sa\u00e1dat Kh\u00e1n, he nominated his own kinsman, Zama Kh\u00e1n, to be governor of the Benares Province. Zama Kh\u00e1n was finally expelled from Jaunpur by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chait Singh of Benares. The Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edr, however, retained possession of the fort, which was not handed over to Chait Singh till the English gave it him in 1777.\n\nOur first connection with the District arose in 1765, when it passed for a short time into our hands after the battle of Baxar. In 1775 it was made over to us permanently by the treaty of Lucknow. From that time nothing occurred which calls for notice up till the date of the Mutiny. On 5th June 1857, news of the Benares revolt reached Jaunpur. The Sepoys of the treasury guard at once mutinied, and shot their own officers, as well as the Joint Magistrate. They then marched off to Lucknow without molesting the other Europeans, who made good their escape to Benares. The District continued in a state of complete anarchy till the arrival of the Gurkh\u00e1 force from Azamgarh on 8th September. The civil officials then returned to Jaunpur, and the police stations were re-established; but the north and west of the District remained in rebellion. In November, owing to the active levies made by Mehndi Hassan, who styled himself Niz\u00e1m of Jaunpur, most of the surrounding country was lost again. But in February 1858, the rebels of the north and west were defeated and dispersed; and in May, the last smouldering embers of disaffection were stifled by the repulse of the insurgent leader Jurhi Singh from Machhlislahahr, at the hands of the people themselves. After that time, no more serious disturbance occurred than the gang robberies of a few desperate dacoit leaders.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Jaunpur is one of the Districts where the spread of\ncultivation has almost reached its limit, and is the third most densely populated District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh. The Census of 1853 returned the population at 1,143,749 persons; in 1865, the number had decreased to 1,015,427; in 1872, there was a slight rise to the total of 1,025,961 persons; and in 1881, to 1,209,663, or an increase of 65,914 in the 28 years since 1853. The Census of 1881 was taken upon an area of 1554 square miles. It disclosed a total population of 1,209,663 persons, distributed among 3120 villages and 204,387 houses. These figures yield the following averages:\u2014Persons per square mile, 778; villages per square mile, 2; houses per square mile, 131.5; persons per village, 388; persons per house, 5.9. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 611,407; females, 598,256; proportion of males, 50.6 per cent. Classified according to age, there were, under 15 years\u2014males 240,984, and females 222,965; total children, 463,949, or 38.3 per cent.: 15 years and upwards\u2014males 370,423, and females 375,291; total adults, 745,714, or 61.7 per cent.\n\nIn religion, Jaunpur is still essentially Hindu, in spite of its long subjection to Muhammadan rulers, and the continued presence of a local Musalm\u00e1n court. The Census shows 1,095,986 Hindus, being at the rate of 90.6 per cent., as against 113,553 Muhammadans, who stand in the proportion of only 9.4 per cent. As regards the ethnical distinctions and caste differences of the people, Br\u00e1hmans in 1881 numbered 149,441; R\u00e1jputs, 115,133; Baniy\u00e1s, 26,287; Ah\u00edrs, 184,019; Cham\u00e1rs, 172,543; K\u00e1yasths, 15,020; and Kurmis, 47,666. Among the Musalm\u00e1ns, Sunnis were returned at 99,849, and Shiah\u00eds at 13,704. With the exception of Lucknow, the Shiah\u00eds form a larger percentage of the Muhammadan population, namely 12 per cent., than in any other District in the Lieutenant-Governorship, owing to the long continuance of a Shiah court at Jaunpur under the Lodi dynasty, which was overthrown by B\u00e1bar at P\u00e1nipat in 1526. Europeans numbered 53; Eurasi\u00e1ns, 36; and native Christians, 31. The sects of Christians represented in Jaunpur are the Churches of England and Rome, Presbyterians and Baptists. The agricultural population of all ages amounted to 916,617, or 75.77 per cent. of the District total.\n\nTown and Rural Population.\u2014There are only four towns the number of whose inhabitants exceeds 5000, namely, Jaunpur with 42,845; Machhl\u00edshahr, 9200; Badshahpur, 6423; and Shahganj, 6317. The aggregate urban population accordingly amounts to 64,785 persons, or less than 5.3 per cent. of the total. Indeed, as upwards of two-thirds of the villages contain less than five hundred inhabitants, it is clear that the great mass of the people are scattered about in small hamlets, as is usual in the eastern Districts of the North-West; whereas, in the western parts of the Province, a considerable proportion of the popula-\ntion is collected together in large towns. Villages containing between five hundred and a thousand inhabitants number 559; while 164 have between one and two thousand. Only 30 places have upwards of two thousand inhabitants.\n\nMaterial Condition of the People.\u2014A trader's house of the better class generally contains about \u00a350 worth of furniture and utensils of all kinds, of which bedsteads, mattresses, quilts, carpets, and boxes represent about \u00a330, and cooking vessels the remainder. A well-to-do cultivator owns a few strong boxes, bedsteads, and quilts, worth about \u00a310, besides cooking vessels worth \u00a35 or \u00a36. An artisan in middling circumstances possesses one or two mattresses, bedsteads, and quilts, and some drinking vessels, worth altogether about \u00a33. A poor labourer has only a few earthen jars, one or two quilts, and perhaps a cot or two of grass cord stretched on a wooden frame, worth in all from 10s. to \u00a31. The poorer classes of cultivators, labourers, and mechanics are all in much the same condition: the coarsest and scantiest clothing and food, a few vessels necessary for cooking, a hut with rough mud walls, and a thatch to cover them being usually the extent of their possessions. The Kurmis and Kachhis are much better off than the other agricultural classes. They cultivate poppy, tobacco, and vegetables, make larger profits, are more steady and industrious; and as they are thus able to pay higher rents, they are much sought after by landlords, and are very rarely disturbed in their holdings. According to occupation, the male population is divided into six classes in the Census Report as follows:\u2014(1) Professional, including Government officials and servants, 5148; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 1877; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 7541; (4) agricultural and pastoral, including gardeners, 294,650; (5) manufacturing, including mechanics and artisans, 44,671; (6) indefinite and non-productive, comprising general labourers and male children, 256,520.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The ordinary soil of Jaunpur is a mixture of vegetable mould, clay, and sand; but in old river-beds and the basins of temporary lakes, a rich black alluvial deposit, answering to the m\u00fbr of Bundelkhand, may occasionally be found. The whole District is one wide expanse of cultivation, with scarcely an available acre untilled. The harvests are those common to the rest of Upper India. The kharif or autumn crops include rice, Indian corn, cotton, bajra, jo\u00e1r, and moth. They are sown in June, immediately after the first rain of the season, and reaped from September to November. The rab\u00ee or spring crops are sown in the autumn months, and reaped from March to April. They consist of wheat, barley, oats, peas, and other pulses. Irrigation is carried on from wells, tanks, ponds, and jhils. Although a certain rotation of crops is observed, yet (except for the cultivation of sugar-\ncane) the intentional leaving land fallow for an entire year is almost unknown. The mode of cultivation is very simple. Seeds are almost always sown broadcast in land ploughed by an iron spike, set between two pieces of wood, and serving both for share and coulter. A wooden board drawn by bullocks does duty for harrow and roller. The quantity of land taken up by the autumn crops varies with the earliness of the rains and other contingencies; as a rule, about one-third of the cultivable area is sown for the kharif. Near the towns, almost all land is tilled for both harvests; but in the low-lying rice lands, and in indigo or sugar-cane plantations, only one crop a year is grown. The best soils are selected for wheat, and barley ranks next in popular estimation. Sugar yields the greatest profit, but it requires much care and plentiful manuring; while the land in which it is grown must always be left fallow for six months or a year. Indigo cultivation on a large scale dates only from the establishment of British rule, and twenty years ago an area of about 14,000 acres was sown with the plant. Since the disastrous seasons of 1870 and 1871, this area has been much curtailed, although there are still in the District seven large indigo concerns under European management, with many outlying factories. Poppy is cultivated, and opium produced under Government regulations, by Kurmis, who are bound to deliver all the opium produced to the officials of the Opium Department at Ghazipur, by whom they are paid at the rate of about 5s. a lb. for opium of 70\u00b0 consistence. The condition of the peasantry is one of only moderate comfort. The Kurmis and Kachhis, however, who cultivate poppy, tobacco, and vegetables, make larger profits than others, and are steadier and more industrious.\n\nThe tenures in the District belong to the three main classes of zamindari, pattidari, and bhayachara. The adult male agricultural population in 1881 was returned at 292,643, namely, landholders, 15,235; estate agents, 1809; cultivators, 237,939; and labourers, 37,570. The female adult agriculturists numbered 138,971, namely, landholders, 987; cultivators, 101,066; and labourers, 36,918. Of a total area, according to the latest official statistics, of 1554 square miles, 1519 square miles were assessed for Government revenue. Of these, 962 square miles were returned as under cultivation, 303 square miles as cultivable, and 254 square miles as uncultivable waste. Total Government assessment, including local rates and cesses levied on land, \u00a3146,962, or an average of 4s. 9d. per cultivated acre. Total rental paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a3233,136, or an average of 7s. 3\u00bdd. per cultivated acre.\n\nThe rates of wages are low, and labour is easily obtained. In 1883, coolies were paid about 3d. per diem; agricultural labourers, from 6s. to 7s. per month; bricklayers, from 4\u00bdd. to 6d. per day. Field hands\nare usually paid in kind, an adult receiving $2\\frac{1}{2}$ lbs. of the coarser grains, with a slight increase at harvest or festivals, and a suit of clothes yearly. Parched gram and treacle for the mid-day meal are supplied by the employer. The average price of food-grains in 1882 was as follows:\u2014 Wheat, $19\\frac{1}{2}$ sers per rupee, or 4s. 6d. per cwt.; best rice, 8 sers per rupee, or 1s. per cwt.; common rice, $16\\frac{1}{4}$ sers per rupee, or 6s. 10d. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 37 sers per rupee, or 3s. per cwt.; bajra, 22 sers per rupee, or 5s. 1d. per cwt.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014The G\u00famti is liable to sudden freshets during the rainy season, owing to the high banks which it has piled up at its entrance into the Ganges, and which act as dams to prevent the prompt outflow of its flooded waters. These inundations extend to its tributary the Sai. Much damage was thus effected in 1774; but the greatest recorded flood took place in September 1871, when the river rose more than 23 feet in fourteen days, and swept away 4000 houses in the city, besides 9000 others in villages along its banks. On the other hand, Jaunpur has been comparatively free from drought. In 1770, the District suffered like all its neighbours; but in 1783, and in 1803, the scarcity did not rise to the point of famine. The disastrous season of 1837\u201338, of course, affected Jaunpur to some extent, yet its worst ravages were confined to the western Districts. The distress of 1860\u201361 did not reach so far east as Jaunpur; while the Bengal famine of 1874 scarcely extended to this District, though severely felt in the trans-Gogra region.\n\nThe last recorded scarcity occurred in 1877 and 1878, owing to the failure of the rab\u00ed or spring crop from drought. To alleviate the distress, Government relief works were set on foot in February 1878, which up to November afforded work to 61,397 persons. Besides these, 25,973 aged or helpless paupers received relief at a poorhouse which was opened in Jaunpur city. The result of the scarcity was the reducing of a large proportion of the people to a weak condition, but without encountering actual starvation. In short, Jaunpur, like its neighbour Azamgarh, has enjoyed a singular immunity from this terrible scourge, when compared with any other part of the plain country. The rainfall seldom or never fails entirely, and it is generally so spread over the year as to secure at least one harvest from total loss.\n\n**Communications, Trade, etc.**\u2014The District is almost entirely devoted to agriculture, and its trade is confined to raw materials and food-stuffs. A considerable manufacture of indigo is carried on at seven large factories, with numerous out-stations, under European management; but since 1870 and 1871, this industry has declined, and the out-turn fallen off. The principal fairs are held at Mari\u00e1hu in September, and at Karchuli in March; they are attended by from 20,000 to 25,000 pilgrims and traders. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway passes\nthrough the District, with a length of 45 miles, and stations at Jal\u00e1lpur, Jaunpur civil station, Jaunpur city, Mihr\u00e1wan, Kheta Sar\u00e1i, Sh\u00e1hganj, and Bilw\u00e1\u00ed. There are altogether 138 miles of metalled and 418\u00bd of unmetalled roads in the District. During the rains, the G\u00famti is navigable for the largest native craft, which are employed in bringing down grain from Oudh. The Sai is also navigable for boats of moderate burthen.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District of Jaunpur formed part of the Benares Province under the Oudh Government; and after the introduction of British rule it was at first included in that Division. In 1865 it was transferred to the Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d Division. The local staff usually consists of a Magistrate-Collector and a Joint or Assistant Magistrate, with the usual native subordinates. The whole amount of revenue (imperial, municipal, or local) raised in the District in 1876 was \u00a3162,472. Of this sum, \u00a3125,072, or nearly five-sixths, was contributed by the land-tax. By 1882\u201383, the gross District revenue had increased to \u00a3191,404, while the land-tax had slightly fallen to \u00a3124,527. In 1882, the total strength of the regular police force was 575 officers and men, maintained at a cost of \u00a35864. These figures give 1 policeman to every 2\u00b77 square miles of area and to every 2103 of the population; while the cost of maintenance was at the rate of \u00a33, 15s. 5\u00bdd. per square mile, or about 1d. per head. The District jail contained a daily average of 224 prisoners in 1882, of whom 212 were males and 12 females. The District contains 19 imperial and 4 local post-offices; and there is a telegraph office at each of the stations on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. Education is making but little progress. In 1875, there were in all 203 schools in Jaunpur, including 7 girls\u2019 schools, with a roll-call of 7570 scholars. The city of Jaunpur has a zil\u00e1 school for Oriental languages, besides a large religious institution for Arabic and Persian. In 1882\u201383, the Government-inspected schools (exclusive of private institutions) numbered 129, with 4976 pupils. In 1881, the Census returned 6802 boys and 115 girls as under instruction, besides 24,954 males and 422 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The District is divided into 5 tahsils and 17 police circles. There is only one municipality, Jaunpur city. In 1882\u201383, its total receipts amounted to \u00a32985, and its expenditure to \u00a32428. The incidence of municipal taxation was at the rate of 1s. 0\u00bed. per head of the population within municipal limits.\n\nSanitary Aspects.\u2014The climate of Jaunpur is moister, the temperature more equable, and the rain more evenly distributed throughout the year, than in most Districts of the North-Western Provinces. The average annual rainfall was 41\u00b771 inches for the 30 years ending 1881. The rainfall in 1881 was 46\u00b710 inches, or 4\u00b739 above the average. The total number of deaths recorded in the year 1882 was 35,455, or 30\u00b739 per thousand of the population. The number of registered deaths from\nfevers was 32,253, or 27\u00b764 per thousand of the population. There are three charitable dispensaries in the District, at Jaunpur, Sh\u00e1hganj, and Machhl\u00edshahr. During the year 1883 they afforded relief to 20,582 persons.\n\nJaunpur.\u2014Tahsil of Jaunpur District, North-Western Provinces, comprising the pargan\u00e1s of Havili Jaunpur, Bi\u00e1lsi, R\u00e1ri, Zafar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Kariy\u00e1t Dost, Khapraha, and tappa Saremu. The G\u00famti and the Sai flow through the tahsil, as also a number of small streamlets and drainage channels. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway crosses the tahsil, which is also well supplied with road communications. Area, according to the latest official statement, 334 square miles, of which 327 square miles are assessed for Government revenue or quit-rent. Of the assessed area, 233\u00b76 square miles are returned as cultivated, 67\u00b72 square miles cultivable, and 26\u00b72 square miles barren. Total amount of Government land revenue, \u00a330,056, or including local rates and cesses levied upon land, \u00a335,563. Amount of rent, including local cesses paid by the cultivators, \u00a356,329. Population (1872) 276,772; (1881) 322,315, namely, males 161,992, and females 160,323, showing a total increase in the nine years of 37,567, or 13 per cent. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 285,002; Muhammadans, 37,201; and \u2018others,\u2019 112. Of the 822 towns and villages comprising the tahsil, 644 contained less than five hundred inhabitants, 30 from five hundred to a thousand, 46 from one to three thousand, and 2 with upwards of three thousand inhabitants.\n\nJaunpur.\u2014Town, municipality, and administrative head-quarters of Jaunpur District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 25\u00b0 41\u2032 31\u2033 N., and long 82\u00b0 43\u2032 38\u2033 E., on the left or northern bank of the river G\u00famti, about 15 miles above its junction with the Sai. Population (1872) 35,003; (1881) 44,845, namely, 25,920 Hindus, 16,832 Muhammadans, 92 Christians, and 1 \u2018other.\u2019 The Census Report states that the actual town of Jaunpur had a population in 1872 of 23,327, and in 1881 of 27,030 on an area of 880 acres. But to keep within the definition of a town it was impossible to demarcate the suburban houses separated only by gardens, ruins, building sites, etc.\n\nJaunpur is a very ancient city, the former capital of a considerable Muhammadan kingdom, which once extended from Bud\u00e1un and Et\u00e1wah to Behar. It abounds in splendid architectural monuments, most of which belong to the Path\u00e1n period, when the rulers of Jaunpur made themselves independent of Delhi, and founded an important local dynasty. (See JAUNPUR DISTRICT.) The fort of F\u00edroz, an irregular quadrangular building, overlooking the north of the G\u00famti, consists of a stone wall, built round an artificial earthen mound. The materials were obtained from ruined Buddhist or Hindu temples, and carved stones taken from these sources occur\nprofusely in the walls. The towers and last remaining buildings in the fort were blown up after the Mutiny of 1857, and nothing now exists but the shell. The date of the fort may be placed about 1360. The hamams or baths of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, which commemorate the name of the great Jaunpur Sult\u00e1n, were constructed about 1420. The Atala Masjid or mosque, also built by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, in 1418, has now nothing left but a rich screen, flanked by ragged pinnacles. It occupies the site of a Hindu temple, attributed to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jai Chand. The Dariba mosque, built by two of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm\u2019s governors, has a domed hall and two wings, masked by a low fa\u00e7ade of the peculiar Jaunpur type. A quarter of a mile from the city, some large piers, upholding a screen of great beauty, mark the site of another of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm\u2019s mosques, the Jinjiri Masjid. The L\u00e1i Darw\u00e1za, erected by B\u00e1b\u00ed R\u00e1j\u00ed, the queen of Mahm\u00fad, about 1450, is still in good preservation, with handsome cloisters and gates. The J\u00e1ma Masjid or great mosque of Hassan, completed after his fall in 1478, occupies the west side of a terrace, while domed gateways on the three other sides give access to a large quadrangle, 70 yards square, surrounded by a colonnade in two storeys. The splendid bridge over the G\u00famti, erected by Mun\u2019im Kh\u00e1n, governor under the Mughals, in 1569-73, measures 712 feet in length, and has four large central arches, with six of smaller span on each side. The cost has been estimated at \u00a3300,000. During the Mutiny of 1857, Jaunpur formed a centre of disaffection. (See Jaunpur District.)\n\nThe town still possesses a considerable trade, and is celebrated for its manufacture of perfumes from the flowers of the rose, jasmine, and screw pine. The manufacture of papier-mach\u00e9 has been recently introduced; but paper-making, which was formerly one of the principal industries of Jaunpur, is now almost totally extinguished in consequence of the competition of machine-made paper. The civil station is situated south of the G\u00famti; the only public buildings are the courts of the magistrate and judge, church, d\u00e1k bungalow, jail, and police lines. The latter are the old cantonments used by the Native troops quartered at Jaunpur before the Mutiny. There are two railway stations on the Oudh and Rohilkhand line, at the city and at the civil station. Municipal revenue in 1882-83, \u00a32985; from taxes, \u00a32221, or 1s. 0\u00bed. per head of population (42,845) within municipal limits.\n\nJaunsar B\u00e1war (or Kalsi).\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of Dehra D\u00fan District, North-Western Provinces, consisting of a rugged triangular wedge of mountains, lying between the valleys of the Jumna and the Tons. Lat. 30\u00b0 31\u2032 to 31\u00b0 1\u2032 N., and long. 77\u00b0 45\u2032 to 78\u00b0 7\u2032 E. The whole tract is so hilly that scarcely a single level spot of a hundred yards occurs. The mountains, which belong to the Him\u00e1layan range, are largely covered with forests of deod\u00e1r. The highest peak attains an\nelevation of 9347 feet above sea-level. Area, 478 square miles, of which only 29 square miles were returned as cultivated in 1881. Population (1872) 40,046; (1881) 45,117, namely, males 25,400, and females 19,717. Of the 495 villages comprising the tahsil, 494 have less than five hundred inhabitants, and 1 from one to two thousand. Agriculture remains in a backward state, but irrigation from the minor torrents fertilizes the few cultivable patches upon the rugged hill-sides. The population consists chiefly of Dh\u00fams, a tribe of low-caste aborigines, Hindus in creed, but scarcely raised above absolute barbarism. Polyandry prevails extensively; education is almost unknown; but crime is comparatively rare. A European detachment occupies the cantonment of Chakrata. The head-quarters of the tahsil are at Kalsi. Land revenue, \u00a32621; total Government revenue, \u00a33017. In 1883, the tahsil contained 2 civil and 2 revenue courts, with 2 police stations.\n\nJaura.\u2014State in Central India.\u2014See Jaora.\n\nJ\u00e1vli.\u2014Sub-division of Sat\u00e1ra District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 419 square miles; number of villages 252, with 10,242 houses. Population (1872) 63,842; (1881) 63,729, namely, 31,946 males and 31,873 females. In 1881 Hindus numbered 61,451; Muhammadans, 1981; 'others,' 297. The Sub-division contains 5 criminal courts; police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 2; regular police, 69 men; village watchmen, 19. Land revenue, \u00a39438.\n\nJ\u00e1wad.\u2014Town in the Sub-division of Nimach of the Native State of Gwalior, Western M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Agency, Central India. Lat. 24\u00b0 36' N., long. 74\u00b0 54' E.; 1400 feet above sea-level. Population (1881) 7692. Stormed in 1818 by the British, and given over to Daulat R\u00e1o Sindhia, to one of whose rebellious adherents it belonged. The town is surrounded by a stone wall, with 52 bastions, and has good gateways. Distant 12 miles due north from Neemuch (Nimach). A fair amount of trade is carried on; there are 30 shroffs' (bankers') shops. Well known for its red cloth. Post-office.\n\nJawad\u00ed.\u2014A range of mountains in Tirupat\u00far taluk, Salem District, Madras Presidency, lying between 12\u00b0 15' and 12\u00b0 40' N. lat., and between 78\u00b0 40' and 79\u00b0 6' E. long., and extending over an area of 344 square miles, with 143 villages. Population (1871) 9296; (1881) 17,549. The Jawad\u00eds or Jav\u00e1dis separate the Tirupat\u00far taluk from the District of South Arcot. The eastern portion of the mountains is clothed with verdure to the summit. The range sinks into the plain near Sing\u00e1rapett. Average height above the sea, 3000 feet. The climate of the range and its valleys is unhealthy, and unsuited to Europeans. The plateau near Raddi\u00far, which is reached from Alang\u00e1yam, is lovely\u2014endless downs, park-like grass lands, dotted with tanks. In the slope of the hill, which faces Bommaikuppam and Mattrapalli, is a stream\nwhich has the property of covering with petrifactions everything which is placed in its waters, as leaves, sticks, etc. The approaches are difficult, and exclusively by bridle-paths. Some portions of the forest land, containing teak, sandal-wood, etc., have been conserved by Government, and the nomadic system of cultivation has of late been restricted, and in some tracts suppressed. The greater part of the hills is inhabited by Malailis, a hill tribe, who style themselves Vell\u00e1lars and Pachai Vell\u00e1lars, the latter being distinguished from the former by the fact that the females are not allowed to tattoo themselves or to tie their hair in the knot called kondai. Both classes came originally from K\u00e1nchipuram.\n\n**Jawah\u00edr.**\u2014Tract of country in Kum\u00e1un, North-Western Provinces. \u2014See JUHAR.\n\n**Jaw\u00e1lamukhi.**\u2014Ancient town in Dehra tahs\u00edl, K\u00e1ngra District, Punjab. Lat. $31\u00b0\\ 52' \\ 34\"$ N., long. $76\u00b0\\ 21' \\ 59\"$ E. Situated on the road from K\u00e1ngra town to N\u00e1d\u00e1un, at the foot of a precipitous range of hills, forming the northern limit of the Beas (Bi\u00e1s) valley. Population (1881) 2424, namely, Hindus, 2217; Jains, 11; Muhammadans, 196; number of houses, 542. Once a considerable and opulent town, which still possesses solid ruins testifying to its former prosperity; now chiefly noticeable from the presence of a very holy shrine, surpassing in reputation even that of K\u00e1ngra. The temple stands above certain jets of combustible gas, issuing from the ground, and kept constantly burning, as a manifestation of the goddess Devi. Seven centuries ago, the deity appeared to a Br\u00e1hman in the south, and bid him repair to this place, where he would find a perpetual flame issuing from the earth. The Br\u00e1hman obeyed, discovered the spot, and built a temple to the goddess. A conflicting and more ancient account, however, narrates that the flames proceed from the mouth of the Daitya king or demon, J\u00e1landhara (see Jal\u00e1ndhar District), who was overwhelmed by Siva under a pile of mountains. The present temple certainly belongs to Devi. The devotion of centuries has enriched it with many costly offerings, amongst others a gilt roof, presented by Ranjit Singh in 1815. About 50,000 pilgrims attend the great festival in September or October. Six hot mineral springs occur in the neighbourhood, impregnated with common salt and iodide of potassium. The town still retains some commercial importance as an entrep\u00f4t for traffic between the hills and the plains. Principal export\u2014opium from Kullu. Police station, post-office, school-house. Sard\u00ed erected by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Pati\u00e1la, attached to the temple. Eight dharm\u00e1s\u00e1las or sanctuaries, with rest-houses for travellers. Municipal revenue (1882\u201383), \u00a3199, derived principally from octroi; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 7\u00bdd. per head.\n\n**Jaw\u00e1l\u00e1pur.**\u2014Town in Sah\u00e1ranpur District, North-Western Pro-\nvinces. Lies in lat. $29^\\circ 55' 33''$ N., and long. $78^\\circ 9' E.$, on the north bank of the Ganges Canal; distant from Rurki (Roorkee) 14 miles north-east, and from Saharanpur town 36 miles east. Population (1881) 15,196, namely, Hindus, 9574; Muhammadans, 5314; and Christians, 8. The town forms with Hardwar a municipal union. Many of the Hindu residents are Br\u00e1hmans connected with the Hardw\u00e1r temples, who have a perpetual feud with the Musalm\u00e1n Rajputs. Police station, post-office, school, dispensary. Municipal revenue of Hardw\u00e1r Union (1881-82), \u00a32627; from taxes, \u00a31523, or 1s. 1d. per head of population (28,106) within municipal limits.\n\nJawh\u00e1r.\u2014Native State under the Political Agency of Th\u00e1n\u00e1, in the Konk\u00e1n, Bombay Presidency; situated between $19^\\circ 40'$ and $20^\\circ 4'$ N. lat., and between $73^\\circ 2'$ and $73^\\circ 23'$ E. long., within the geographical limits of Th\u00e1n\u00e1 District. Jawh\u00e1r State consists of two unequal patches of territory, the larger in the north-western part of Th\u00e1n\u00e1 District, and the smaller in the north-eastern. The Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway just touches the western boundary of the smaller patch. Area, 534 square miles. Population (1881) 48,556, namely, 25,174 males and 23,382 females; density of population per square mile, 91; number of villages, 116; occupied houses, 8307; unoccupied, 1068. According to religion, the population is divided into 6869 Hindus, 501 Muhammadans, and 41,186 \u2018others.\u2019 Since 1872, the population has increased by 11,150. Average revenue, inclusive of transit dues, \u00a310,000.\n\nMost of the State is a plateau raised about 1000 feet above the Konk\u00e1n plain. Eastward the Sahy\u00e1dris can be crossed by pack-bullocks through the Chinchut\u00e1ra and Gonde passes to the north, and through the Dhondmare and Shir passes to the south, of the high hill of Vatvad. The westerly route, about 35 miles from Jawh\u00e1r to the D\u00e1h\u00e1nu Road station of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, crosses the Kas\u00e1tw\u00e1di and Deng passes by a metalled road built by the British in 1872-74. Towards the south and west of the State, the country is in some places level, but the rest of the territory is elevated, and consists of the rocky and forest-covered tract that everywhere lies at the western foot of the Sahy\u00e1dri range. Though its many fertile valleys contain numerous streams, their waters are not used for irrigation. The chief streams are the Deharji, the Surya, the Pinjali, and the Vagh. Except in the southern mah\u00e1l (sub-division) of Malv\u00e1da, the water supply fails as the hot season advances. Between June and October the rainfall is heavy. After the close of the rainy season till the end of December, the air retains a considerable degree of moisture. In January and February the dryness and heat increase, followed from March to June by a tolerably warm season. During the greater part of the year, the climate is malarious and unhealthy. The\nprevailing diseases are fever and ague. Good building stone is found. Besides timber, the country yields rice to a limited extent, and the coarser grains abundantly.\n\nUp to 1294, the period of the first Muhammadan invasion of the Deccan, Jawh\u00e1r was held by a V\u00e1rl\u00ed, not a Kol\u00ed, chief. The first Kol\u00ed chief, Paupera, obtained his footing in Jawh\u00e1r by a device similar to that of Dido, when she asked for and received as much land as the hide of a bull would cover. The Kol\u00ed chief cut his hide into strips, and thus enclosed the territory of the State. In the succeeding centuries Jawh\u00e1r had to carry on a struggle, first with the Portuguese, and afterwards with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The present (1884) chief, Malh\u00e1r R\u00e1o, alias Patang Sh\u00e1h (adopted), is a Hindu of the Kol\u00ed tribe. He has power to try his own subjects for capital offences without the express permission of the Political Agent. The succession follows the rule of primogeniture: there is no sanad authorizing adoption. In the case of the present chief, the adoption was recognised by the paramount power on receipt of a special payment or nazar\u00e1na. J\u00e1ya Mukney, the founder of the State, established himself as a freebooter in the country about Jawh\u00e1r nearly 550 years ago. He was succeeded by his son N\u00edm Sh\u00e1h, on whom, about the year 1341, the Emperor of Delhi conferred the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1. So important was this event in the history of Jawh\u00e1r that the 5th of June 1343, the day on which the title was received, has been made the beginning of a new era, which is still used in public documents. The only place of interest in the State is the ruined fort of Bhopatgarh, about 10 miles south-east of Jawh\u00e1r town.\n\nThe chief decides first-class magisterial and sessions cases, and hears appeals. There is a State jail; number of prisoners (1881), 92; regular police, 21 men. There are six schools, one of them in Jawh\u00e1r town, with an average monthly attendance of 79 pupils. A dispensary was opened in 1878, and was attended in 1881 by 1133 patients.\n\n**Jawah\u00e1r.**\u2014Chief town of the Native State of Jawh\u00e1r, in the Konk\u00e1n, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 19\u00b0 56' N., and long. 73\u00b0 16' E.; fifty miles north-east of Th\u00e1na. The town contains 200 houses. It is healthy, and free from excessive heat; elevation above sea-level, 1000 feet. Public office for the chief, school-house, and dispensary. The water supply is scanty; but the works in progress to enlarge the Surya reservoir and to embank a low piece of ground will materially improve it.\n\n**Jayamangali.**\u2014River in Mysore State; tributary of the North Pin\u00e1kini river, which runs through the north-east corner of T\u00famk\u00far District, Mysore State, and joins the North Pin\u00e1kini in the adjoining Madras District of Bellary. The Jayamangali rises in the Devaray-durga Hills, and flows northward through the Kortagiri taluk. Its sandy bed affords facilities for irrigation by means of kapili wells, and talpargi or spring-head streams drawn from the channel.\nJeddy\u00e1 Gowden.\u2014Mountain in South Arcot District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 11\u00b0 40' to 11\u00b0 51' N., long. 78\u00b0 42' to 78\u00b0 53' E.\n\nJehlam (Jahlam, Jhelum).\u2014River in the Punjab; the most westerly of the five streams from which the Province derives its name. It is also known as the Bihet or Bitasta, corruptions of its Sanskrit name Vitasta, which Alexander's historians Gr\u00e6cized into Hydaspes, but Ptolemy more correctly as Bidaspes. The Jehlam rises in Kashmir State, among the mountains forming the north-eastern boundary of the valley, and, after flowing in a south-westerly course, forms a junction with the streams which have their origin in the P\u00edr Panj\u00e1l range. It then passes through the picturesque string of lakes in the neighbourhood of Srinagar or Kashmir city, and flows thenceforth above the level of the lower valley, being confined by high banks like those of the Po. Before entering the Walar Lake, it receives the waters of a considerable tributary, the Sind, which rises in the northern mountains. The united stream then pours through the snow-clad P\u00edr Panj\u00e1l range by the narrow pass of Bar\u00e1mula, which forms an outlet for the entire basin of the Kashmir valley. A vast lake at one time probably filled the whole of this great central hollow in the Himalayan system; but the outlet has been gradually worn down by the escaping flood, till only the lowest portion of the valley now remains covered with water. The distance from the source to the lower mouth of the Bar\u00e1mula Pass may be estimated at about 130 miles, of which 70 are navigable. The river has a breadth of 420 feet at Bar\u00e1mula.\n\nAt Muzaffar\u00e1b\u00e1d, just before entering British territory, the Jehlam receives the Kishan Gang\u00e1, a river of at least equal length, which rises in Baltist\u00e1n or Little Tibet, and drains an extensive valley among the Northern Himalayas. It next forms the boundary between the Kashmir State and the British Districts of Haz\u00e1ra and R\u00e1wal Pindi, flowing in a narrow rocky bed, shut in by mountains on either side. Numerous rapids here render navigation impossible, though large quantities of timber are floated down from Kashmir. A handsome suspension bridge at Koh\u00e1la in Haz\u00e1ra conveys the Kashmir road across the river. Below Dangalli, 40 miles east of R\u00e1wal Pindi, the Jehlam becomes navigable. Passing into Jehlam District, it skirts the outlying spurs of the Salt Range, and finally debouches upon the plains a little above the town of Jehlam, about 250 miles from its source. Below Jehlam, inundation of the lowlands begins to be possible, and low sandy islands stud the wide bed of the stream. After a south-westerly course of more than 100 miles, during which the river divides the District of Jehlam from those of Gujr\u00e1t and Sh\u00e1hpur, it enters the latter District entirely, and trends thenceforth more directly southward. The width in this portion of its course averages 800 yards in flood, dwindling down during the winter months to less than half that size.\nSudden freshets occur after heavy rains, and cause frequent inundations over the lowlands, greatly increasing the productive power of the soil. The Jehlam next enters the District of Jhang, where it preserves the same general characteristics, but with a wider valley, bounded by the high uplands known as the b\u0101r. It finally joins the Chen\u00e1b (Chin\u00e1b) at Timmu, in lat. $31^\\circ 11'$ N., long. $72^\\circ 12'$ E., 10 miles to the south of Maghi\u00e1n\u00e1, after a total course of not less than 450 miles, of which about 200 lie within British territory. The current in the plains has an average rate of 4 miles per hour. The wedge of land between the Jehlam and the Chen\u00e1b is known as the Jech Do\u00e1b; while the tract stretching westward to the Indus bears the name of the Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) Do\u00e1b.\n\nThe principal towns upon the Jehlam are Kashmir or Sr\u00ednagar (situated on one of its lacustrine expansions), Jehlam, Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n, Mi\u00e1ni, Bher\u00e1, and Sh\u00e1hpur. According to General Cunningham, the point where Alexander crossed the Hydaspes may be identified with Jal\u00e1ipur in Jehlam District; while nearly opposite, on the Gujr\u00e1t bank, stands the modern battle-field of Chili\u00e1nw\u00e1l\u00e1. Bridges of boats cross the river at Jehlam and Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n, and at a point just below its junction with the Chen\u00e1b. The permanent railway bridge of the Northern Punjab State Line also crosses at the town of Jehlam. For further particulars, see Hazara, Rawal Pindi, Jehlam, Gujr\u00e1t, Sh\u00e1hpur, and Jhang Districts, and Kashmir State.\n\n**Jehlam.**\u2014British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab (Panj\u00e1b), lying between $32^\\circ 26'$ and $33^\\circ 15'$ N. lat., and between $71^\\circ 51'$ and $73^\\circ 50'$ E. long. Jehlam is a District in the R\u00e1wal Pindi Division. It stands ninth in order of area and eighteenth in order of population among the thirty-two Districts of the Province, comprising $3\\cdot67$ per cent. of the total area, $3\\cdot14$ per cent. of the total population, and $2\\cdot50$ per cent. of the urban population of British territory. It is bounded on the north by R\u00e1wal Pindi District; on the east by the river Jehlam; on the south by the river Jehlam and Sh\u00e1hpur District; and on the west by Bannu and Sh\u00e1hpur Districts. Area, 3910 square miles; population (1881) 589,373 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at Jehlam town, which is also the chief centre of population and commerce in the District.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Jehlam forms the south-eastern portion of that rugged Him\u00e1layan spur known as the Salt Range, which extends between the Indus and Jehlam rivers into the borders of the Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) Do\u00e1b. Although its surface is not so wild as the mountain region of R\u00e1wal Pindi, it yet presents a general appearance of great beauty and sublimity, relieved in places by smiling patches of cultivated valley. The backbone of the District is formed by the Salt Range, a double line of parallel hills, mainly composed of red sandstone and\ncarboniferous rocks, running in two long forks from east to west throughout its whole breadth. At their foot lies a small strip of level soil, stretching along the banks of the Jehlam, and thickly dotted with prosperous villages, some of which receive and detain the fertilizing waters from the lower slopes. Above this favoured tract, the Salt Range rises in bold and striking precipices, broken by gorges of dull russet sandstone and grey gypsum, which contrast finely with the brilliant redness of the superficial soil. The latter peculiarity marks the presence of salt, from which the range derives its name, and which is mined in enormous quantities, under Government supervision, at Kheura. Some of the gorges are clothed with green brushwood, and traversed by trickling streams, at first pure and fresh, but soon impregnated with the saline matter over which they flow, and thus rendered worse than useless for purposes of irrigation.\n\nBetween the lines of hills lies a picturesque table-land, in which the beautiful little lake of Kallar Kah\u00e1r nestles amongst the minor ridges\u2014at one end a mimic dead sea, surrounded by bare and rocky hills, its banks encrusted with salt, and devoid of life or vegetation; at the other, a glistening lake, crowned by wooded heights, and alive with myriads of wildfowl. North of the Salt Range, again, the country extends upward in an elevated plateau, diversified by countless ravines and fissures, until it loses itself in the tangled masses of the R\u00e1wal Pindi mountains. The drainage of the District is determined by a low central watershed, running north and south, at right angles to the Salt Range. The waters of the western portion find their way into the Soh\u00e1n, and finally into the Indus; those of the opposite slope collect into small torrents, and empty themselves into the Jehlam, which skirts the District for 100 miles on its eastern and southern edge. This river is navigable for some distance above the town of Jehlam for the flat-bottomed craft of the country.\n\nThe mineral wealth of the Salt Range is considerable. Not only are building stones and marbles of great beauty produced in abundance, but there is a large variety of stones that supply lime. There is also gypsum for plaster of Paris, and various red earths and ochres occur which have value as colouring agents. Coal, sulphur, and petroleum are found, and many metals, including copper, gold, lead, and iron. This last occurs in the form of rich hematite, and is in some places so abundant that the rocks containing it disturb the indications of the magnetic compass. Finally, the range furnishes the greater portion of the salt-supply of the Punjab. With the exception of salt, indeed, little has yet been done to develope its mineral resources, the exceeding cost of carriage having been the great obstacle; but now that railway communication between Mi\u00e1ni and Lahore has lessened this difficulty, it is to be hoped that a region so fertile in mineral pro-\nducts will not be allowed to lie fallow. The Administration Report for 1878-79 (the latest return) shows salt mines at Kheura, Sardi, Makr\u00e1ch, Katha, and J\u00e1t\u00e1na, of which the first two alone were worked during the year, and yielded 3,241,508 maunds; and coal mines, at Makr\u00e1ch, Pidh, Dandot, and Kundal. The coal is generally of inferior quality, and its use commercially for fuel has hitherto not proved successful. Recently, however (1884), the mineral has been extensively purchased by the railway authorities at Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n. The seams excavated are those at Makr\u00e1ch, where there is an outcrop on the surface, said to be of a good hard quality. Sulphuret of lead or galena is found in small nodules in two or three localities. It is chiefly found in clefts in the most inaccessible precipices of the hills.\n\nHistory.\u2014The early annals of Jehlam present more points of interest than its records in modern times, since it can claim a mention both in the semi-mythical geography of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata and in the more veracious pages of Alexander's historians. Hindu tradition represents the Salt Range as the refuge of the P\u00e1ndavas during the period of their exile; and every salient point in its scenery is connected with some legend of the national heroes. On the other hand, modern research has decided that the conflict between Alexander and Porus took place at some point within the present District; though the exact spot at which the Macedonian king effected the passage of the Jehlam (or Hydaspes) has been hotly disputed. General Cunningham is probably correct in supposing that the real site of the crossing was at Jal\u00e1lpur, which he identifies with the city of Bukephala; and that the battle with Porus\u2014a Greek corruption of the name Purusha\u2014took place at Mong, on the Gujr\u00e1t side, close to the field of Chili\u00e1nw\u00e1l\u00e1. But when the brief light cast upon the District by Arrian and by Curtius has been withdrawn, we have little information with reference to its condition, until the Musalm\u00e1n conquest brought back literature and history to Upper India.\n\nThe Janj\u00faahs and J\u00e1ts, who, along with other tribes, now hold the Salt Range and the northern plateau respectively, appear to have been the earliest inhabitants. The former are doubtless pure R\u00e1jputs, while the J\u00e1ts are perhaps their degenerate descendants. The Ghakkars seem to represent an early wave of conquest from the east, and they still inhabit a large tract in the east of the District; while the Aw\u00e1ns, who now cluster in the western plain, are apparently later invaders from the opposite quarter. The Ghakkars were the dominant race at the period of the first Muhammadan incursions; and they long continued to retain their independence both in Jehlam itself and in the neighbouring District of Rawal Pindi, where the history of the tribe will be found more fully traced. During the flourishing period of the Mughal dynasty, the Ghakkar chieftains were among the most\nprosperous and loyal vassals of the house of B\u00e1bar. But after the collapse of the Delhi Empire, Jehlam fell, like its neighbours, under the sway of the Sikhs. In 1765, G\u00fajar Singh defeated the last independent Ghakkar prince, and reduced the wild mountaineers of the Salt Range and the Murree (Marri) Hills to subjection. His son succeeded to his dominions, until 1810, when he fell before the irresistible power of Ranjit Singh. Under the Lahore Government, the dominant classes of Jehlam suffered much from fiscal exactions; and the Janj\u00faah, Ghakkar, and Aw\u00e1n families gradually lost their landed estates, which passed into the hands of their J\u00e1t dependants. The feudal power declined and slowly died out, so that at the present time hardly any of the older chieftains survive, while their modern representatives hold no higher posts than that of village head-men. In 1849, Jehlam passed, with the rest of the Sikh territories, into the power of the British. Ranjit Singh, however, had so thoroughly subjugated the wild mountain tribes who inhabited the District, that little difficulty was experienced in reducing it to working order; and the subsequent history of Jehlam has been purely fiscal and administrative.\n\nThe country is still studded with interesting relics of antiquity, amongst which the most noticeable are the ruined temples of Kat\u00e1s, built about the 8th or 9th century of our era, and perhaps of Buddhist origin. Other religious ruins exist at Malot and Siva-Gang\u00e1; while the ancient forts of Roht\u00e1s, Girjhak, and Kus\u00e1k, standing on precipitous rocks in the Salt Range, are of deep interest for the military historian. Indeed, the position of Jehlam on the great north-western highway, by which so many conquerors have entered India, from the Greek to the Mughal, has necessarily made it a land of fortresses and guarded defiles, and has turned its people into hereditary warriors.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1855, which was the first enumeration of the inhabitants, disclosed a total population of 429,420 persons. In 1868, while the area remained practically identical, the number of inhabitants had increased to 500,988, showing a total gain, for the thirteen years, of 71,568 persons, or 16\u00b766 per cent. The last Census in 1881 disclosed a population of 589,373, showing a further increase since 1868 of 88,385, or 14\u00b799 per cent. The results of the Census of 1881 may be briefly summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 3910 square miles, containing 6 towns and 950 villages; total number of houses, 81,292, of which 72,013 were occupied and 9279 unoccupied; number of families, 131,753. Total population, 589,373, namely, males 313,448, and females 275,925; proportion of males, 53\u00b72 per cent. These figures yield the following averages:\u2014Persons per square mile, 151; villages or townships per square mile, 0\u00b724; persons per village, 616; houses per square mile, 21; persons per occupied house, 8\u00b719. The increase of density during the twenty-\nsix years between 1855 and 1881 has amounted to 41 persons per square mile. Classified according to age, there were, under 15 years\u2014males 127,159, and females 111,111; total children, 238,270, or 40.43 per cent.: 15 years and upwards, males 186,289, and females 164,814; total adults, 351,103, or 59.57 per cent. According to religion, Jehlam is a stronghold of Islam, as many as 516,745 persons, or 87.68 per cent., being returned as Musalmans. The Hindus number only 60,949, or 10.34 per cent. The Sikhs have left few traces of their supremacy in the composition of the people, as they now number only 11,188, or 1.89 per cent. The remainder is made up of 58 Jains, 416 Christians, 16 Parsis, and 1 unspecified.\n\nWith reference to ethnical divisions, the chief Hindu tribes are the Brahmins, Khattris, and Aroras. The former caste numbers 10,010, sub-divided with the usual nicety into minor branches, none of which will eat or intermarry with another. The Khattris (35,941) are the traders and money-lenders of Jehlam, replacing the Baniyas throughout the Sind Sagar Doab. The Aroras (12,345) are a simple agricultural tribe. Amongst the clans and castes now almost exclusively Muhammadans, the Jats claim first notice, both by their numbers and their agricultural importance. They hold the whole central region to the north and south of the Salt Range, the hills themselves being the home of the Janjuahs. The general reputation for industry which they possess elsewhere follows them here; and they proved loyal during the events of 1857. Their total numbers in Jehlam District are returned at 88,371 in the Census Report of 1881. The Awans rank first in numerical order with a total of 92,856 persons, the tribe under this name being almost peculiar to this District and Rawal Pindi. They are essentially a tribe of the Salt Range, where they once held independent possessions of very considerable extent, and in the western and central portions of which they are still the dominant race. They are also found in considerable numbers in other Districts, where, however, they are commonly called Jats. A romantic interest is thrown around them by the conjecture that they represent the descendants of Alexander's army; though they themselves put forward a still more apocryphal genealogy from the son-in-law of the Prophet. The Rajputs, who are closely allied to the Jats, are returned at 53,279, the dominant clans being the Janjuahs (9964), Marihas (15,199), and Bhattis (10,430). The Gujars (18,924), who farther south form a pastoral tribe with a bad reputation for cattle-lifting, are here a body of thriving and honest agriculturists, with a fine manly physique, and considerable landed possessions around the town of Jehlam. The Kashmiris are returned at 9672; large numbers of them arrive every winter in search of harvest work, and return home when the summer sets in. The other principal tribes are the Ghakkars (9920), the ancient rulers of the Cis-Indus Salt\nRange tract. They make capital soldiers, and are described as the best light cavalry in Upper India, and as good but not first-class agriculturists. Many also work as coolies on the railway. The Arains, 15,470 in number, are admirable cultivators and market gardeners. The Khokars, though numerically unimportant (1745), possess great social distinction, and are ordinarily considered a Rajput tribe, under which heading or that of Jats most of them have returned themselves. Total Khokars, including Rajputs and Jats, 5964. One of their ancestors founded the town of Pind Dadan Khan, which he called after his own name, and which has become the chief centre of the salt trade. The family lost most of their possessions in 1849, but has since been permitted to regain some part of its former property. The lower artisan and menial castes are nearly all Muhammadans by religion. The most important of these are\u2014Chuhras, sweepers and scavengers, 25,027; Tarkhans, carpenters, 14,824; Kumbhars, potters, 10,031; Lohars, blacksmiths, 9970; Na\u00efs, barbers, 10,569; and Muchis, tanners and leather workers, 11,222. These castes are all village servants, receiving the customary payment for their services in the shape of a share of the harvest, instead of in money. The Muhammadans of pure descent, as distinguished from the descendants of converted Hindus, are\u2014Sayyids, 14,663; Mughals, 11,222; Shaikhs, 8412; and Pathans, 4618. Of the Christian population, numbering 406 in 1881, 368 were returned as Europeans or Eurasians, and 48 as natives. The American Presbyterian Mission has had a branch mission at Jehlam town since 1874, with a congregation numbering about 25 converts.\n\nJehlum District contained in 1881, six towns containing a population exceeding five thousand\u2014namely, Jehlam, 21,107; Pind Dadan Khan, 16,724; Lawa, 6245; Talagang, 6236; Chakwal, 5717; and Bhaun, 5080. The urban population accordingly amounted to 61,109, or 10.4 per cent. of the District total. Jehlam and Pind Dadan Khan are important trade centres for the surrounding neighbourhood. Of the 956 towns and villages in the District in 1881, the Census Report returned 321 as having less than two hundred inhabitants; 287 with from two to five hundred; 189 from five hundred to a thousand; 115 from one to two thousand; 30 from two to three thousand; 8 from three to five thousand; 4 from five to ten thousand; 1 from fifteen to twenty thousand; and 1 with upwards of twenty thousand inhabitants.\n\nAs regards occupation, the male population exceeding 15 years of age is classified as follows by the Census:\u2014(1) Professional class, including Government officials, civil and military, and the learned professions, 9982; (2) domestic and menial class, 4712; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 8553; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 99,879; (5) industrial and manufacturing class, 41,873; (6) indefinite and non-productive class,\ncomprising general labourers, 15,140; (7) unspecified, 6150. The language in common use is Panjabi, which is returned as being spoken by 584,073 out of the 589,373 inhabitants of the District.\n\nThe village houses are almost universally built of mud or sun-dried bricks, one storey high and flat-roofed. Where stones are abundant, they are often built up into the mud walls, in the rough. Recently a few of the leading head-men have built new houses of squared and dressed stone, and nearly all the new mosques in the wealthier villages are now so built. Most houses have a yard in front, which is commonly walled in, but sometimes only set round with a loose thorn hedge. This contains the feeding troughs for cattle. Inside, the houses are kept scrupulously clean. The walls are plastered with cow-dung and polished, or sometimes whitewashed. Generally the pots and pans are arranged upon shelves or recesses. Most houses contain a store-bin for grain. The furniture consists of the ordinary cooking utensils, a few beds, stools, spinning wheels, a handmill for grinding, and also probably one or two baskets to hold clothes in. Some of the more advanced head-men have recently taken to the use of English glass and earthenware of a strong coarse kind. The prettiest things about the upper class of houses are the carved doorways, and the inlaid and painted ceilings of wood. Both are the work of common carpenters, but they are often really artistic and beautiful. The staple food of the people is wheat and bajra, with maize, rice, moth, and barley as an occasional change. The richer classes vary their diet by the addition of some sweetmeats, or a pillau of rice and meat. Meat is eaten by all who can afford it, and milk is largely consumed at all times.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of a total area of 3910 square miles or 2,502,400 acres, according to the latest quinquennial statistics published by the Punjab Government in 1878\u201379, 1333 square miles or 853,120 acres were returned as under cultivation in that year; 331 square miles or 211,840 acres as cultivable but not under tillage; and no less than 2246 square miles or 1,437,440 acres as uncultivable waste. In 1882\u201383, the total crop area (including lands yielding two harvests in the year) was 1644\u00bd square miles or 1,052,408 acres. The staple crops are wheat in the spring harvest, and bajra in the autumn. The area under each, in 1871\u201372, was 325,129 acres of the former, and 180,425 of the latter. In 1882\u201383, wheat occupied 259,581 acres, and bajra 246,152 acres. The other agricultural products are cereals and oil-seeds. Cotton was largely grown during the American war, but since the decline in prices the villagers have returned to their more familiar crops, only 17,295 acres of this staple being planted in 1871\u201372. Since then, the area under cotton has considerably increased, the area cultivated in 1882\u201383 being 30,993\nacres. The common coarse vegetables of India are abundant, though fruits and European garden plants have found little favour as yet.\n\nThere is no extensive system of irrigation in Jehlam, but 24,937 acres were watered by private enterprise in 1878-79. Wells are used in the fertile strip between the Salt Range and the river, and among the ravines. In many cases each well supplies only a very few acres; but these are plentifully manured and tilled like a garden, so as to produce a perpetual succession of sub-tropical vegetables and fruit throughout the year. In the fissured table-land to the north of the Salt Range, irrigation is more commonly practised by damming up the ravines, so as to retain the water and at the same time procure a rich deposit of sediment. The construction of these dams often demands both capital and energy. The largest are relics of a time when the District was in the hands of great landowners; but the security of British rule has induced the people themselves to turn their attention once more to similar works, and many new ones have lately been undertaken, with most profitable results. The agricultural stock of the District is approximately returned as follows:\u2014Cows and bullocks, 229,653; horses, 5763; ponies, 711; donkeys, 22,815; sheep and goats, 275,845; camels, 9399; ploughs, 41,731. The condition of the peasantry is on the whole prosperous. Debt is comparatively rare; and the chief cause of poverty, where it exists, is the excessive sub-division of the soil. In former years, although primogeniture was unknown, many of the leading families contrived to keep their estates undivided by the simple method of fighting amongst themselves until only a single representative was left.\n\nUnder the restrictive regulations of British rule, constant distribution of property amongst the surviving heirs is rapidly reducing the richer houses to the level of their neighbours. The ancient communal type of village tenure has been generally replaced by the system known as bh\u00e1y\u00e1ch\u00e1ra, under which the rights and liabilities of each shareholder are determined, not by ancestral custom, but by the amount of land which he possesses. Some of the villages are much larger than in the average of Indian Districts, a single one containing as many (in an extreme case) as 90,000 acres; and their great size gives a social importance to their head-men which is unknown amongst the peasantry elsewhere. Out of a total of 979 estates at the recent revision of the land settlement in 1880-81, 858 were held under bh\u00e1y\u00e1ch\u00e1ra, 74 under pattid\u00e1ri, and 47 under zamind\u00e1ri tenure.\n\nThe land is almost equally divided between tenants-at-will and those with rights of occupancy. The total male adult population is returned at 98,227, but the number of persons entirely dependent on the soil is 318,019, or 55\u00b78 per cent. of the whole population of the District. Government assessment in 1881, including cesses and rates levied on the land, \u00a383,545. Total estimated rental, including cesses\npaid by the cultivators, \u00a3162,106. Rents, of course, vary with the nature of the crop for which the soil is suited. But they nearly all take the form of payments in kind which are fixed by custom, and are uniform over large areas. These rents are nearly always the same for all classes of tenants. Everywhere the shares allotted as fees for the village menials (kamins), such as carpenters, potters, barbers, blacksmiths, etc., are first deducted. These fees vary from 10 to 12 per cent., except in Talagang tahsil, where they amount to from 6 to 8 per cent. The remainder of the produce is divided as follows:\u2014In Jehlam tahsil, the landlord and tenant share and share alike, both in the grain and straw. In Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n and Chakw\u00e1l tahsil, the landlord generally takes half the grain, except in a few villages where his share is only two-fifths. In Talagang, the landlord's share varies from one-fourth to one-half, the common rate for unirrigated lands being one-third. The highest money rate is that for opium lands, which bring in from \u00a32 to \u00a34 per acre. Other rents rule as follows:\u2014Wheat, from 8s. to 12s. per acre, irrigated\u2014from 6s. to 8s., unirrigated; inferior grains, from 4s. to 8s., irrigated\u2014from 2s. to 4s., unirrigated; cotton, from 10s. to \u00a31; rice, from 10s. to \u00a31. Wages are chiefly paid in kind. In a good harvest, labourers earn as much as 6d. per diem, or its equivalent in grain. Prices were returned as follows in January 1871:\u2014Wheat, 16 sers per rupee, or 7s. per cwt.; barley, 21 sers per rupee, or 5s. 4d. per cwt.; bajra, 23 sers per rupee, or 4s. 10\u00bdd. per cwt. In January 1883, prices ranged much lower, and were returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 27 sers per rupee, or 4s. 2d. per cwt.; flour, 24 sers per rupee, or 4s. 8d. per cwt.; barley, 41 sers per rupee, or 2s. 9d. per cwt.; gram, 29\u00bd sers per rupee, or 3s. 9\u00bdd. per cwt.; Indian corn, 34 sers per rupee, or 3s. 4d. per cwt.; jodh, 40 sers per rupee, or 2s. 10d. per cwt.; bajra, 38 sers per rupee, or 3s. per cwt.; rice (best), 52 sers per rupee, or 2os. 4\u00bdd. per cwt.; cotton (cleaned), 3\u00bd sers per rupee, or 32s. 8d. per cwt.; sugar (refined), 3 sers per rupee, or 37s. 4d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014No statistics are available for the general trade of the District, which is chiefly concentrated in the towns of Jehlam and Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n. The exports include\u2014salt, for the south; food-grains, principally wheat, sent for the most part to Mult\u00e1n, Sind, and R\u00e1wal Pindi; silk and cotton goods, for the wilder country to the north and west; with brass and copper ware for the whole neighbourhood. Stone is exported by boat as far as Mult\u00e1n. The Tarrakawila quarries have been leased by the Punjab Northern State Railway, and the stone is being used in the construction of the Lahore Cathedral. Timber floated down the Jehlam river from the mountains is largely exported in country carts by railway and by water. Merchants travel about the District buying up hides, of which the best are sent\nto Calcutta for export, and the inferior ones to Amritsar. The imports are English piece-goods and metal from Amritsar and Mult\u00e1n, woollen fabrics from Kashmir, and Central Asiatic stuffs from Pesh\u00e1war. A miscellaneous export and import trade is also carried on with Kashmir.\n\nSalt is procured in immense quantities from the mines in the central range, which are now worked under Government supervision, and managed by a duly qualified engineer. The net revenue from this source amounted in 1871-72 to the sum of \u00a3362,193, and in 1882-83 to \u00a3293,400. A quarter of a million of tons per annum can be turned out if necessary. Gypsum is also found in the same range; and an inferior lignite exists in the oolitic and tertiary beds, but the coal is of poor quality, and has not yet been mined to advantage. A further attempt is now being made to work the mineral at the Makr\u00e1ch beds, and it is being purchased largely for railway purposes by the Northern Punjab State Railway.\n\nThe local manufactures and industries comprise boat-building, at Jehlam town and Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n; a rough glass manufacture by a colony of Ghakkars at or near Sult\u00e1npur; copper and brass manufactures; silk and cotton weaving; unglazed pottery of a remarkably strong and good quality, etc. Gold-washing is carried on in the beds of the numerous n\u00e1l\u00eds or streams which flow through the Salt Range.\n\nThe principal means of communication is the Grand Trunk Road, from Lahore to Pesh\u00e1war, which passes through the District from north to south, traversing a wild and tortuous country, and heavily taxing the skill of the engineers. It is the only metalled line in Jehlam, and is 30 miles in length within the District; but there are 882 miles of unmetalled roads, forming a complete network of intercommunication. The Northern State Railway from Lahore to Pesh\u00e1war runs across the south-eastern corner of the District, for a distance of 28 miles, having stations at Jehlam, D\u00edna, Domeli, and Soh\u00e1wa, while a short branch of 5 miles connects Mi\u00e1ni with the Kheura salt mines. A railway bridge crosses the river at Jehlam, with a sub-way for animals and foot passengers. The river Jehlam is navigable for 127 miles along the eastern frontier. A line of telegraph runs by the side of the trunk road with an office at each station; and there is also an imperial telegraph office at Jehlam cantonment. Imperial post-offices, with money order and savings bank branches, are stationed at eighteen towns and villages. Two great religious fairs, the one Hindu and the other Muhammadan, take place at Kat\u00e1s and at Choya S\u00e1idan Sh\u00e1h respectively, on the 9th of April and two following days. As many as 50,000 pilgrims are estimated to be present at each festival.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The ordinary administrative staff of Jehlam consists of 1 Deputy Commissioner, 2 Assistant and 1 extra-Assistant Commis-\nsioners, 4 tahsildars, with their deputies, and 3 munisifs. The total revenue (in which the profits of the salt mines are not included) amounted in 1872-73 to \u00a370,299, of which \u00a359,766 was derived from the land-tax. In 1882-83, the gross revenue was returned at \u00a387,729, of which \u00a369,053 was contributed by the land-tax. The other principal items are stamps and local rates. The incidence of the land revenue is unusually light. In 1882, the imperial police numbered 403 officers and men; municipal police, 104; cantonment police, 8; and village watch, 439. The whole machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property consisted in 1882 of 954 men, being an average of 1 constable to every 618 of the population and every 5 square miles of area. The District jail at Jehlam contained an average daily population in 1872 of 275 prisoners, and in 1882 of 253 prisoners. Education has made great strides of late years. In 1872-73, the roll of children under instruction showed a total of 8784, or more than double the whole number of persons who could read and write in 1868. There were 18 girls' schools in the District, with a roll of 678 pupils, founded by the benevolent exertions of Bedi Khem Singh, a native gentleman who has greatly interested himself in female education. In 1882-83, the total number of schools under the control of the Education Department was 50, attended by a total of 4285 pupils. Of these 8 were girls' schools, with an attendance of 258 pupils. There are also 6 girls' schools conducted by the American Presbyterian Mission at Jehlam town. Besides these, there were returned 1159 indigenous schools, with an attendance of 13,854. For fiscal and administrative purposes, the District is sub-divided into the 4 tahsils of Jehlam, Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n, Chakw\u00e1l, and Talagang; and into 10 pargan\u00e1s, containing an aggregate of 939 estates, owned by 49,866 registered proprietors or coparceners; average land revenue from each estate, \u00a374, 17s. 3\u00bdd.; from each proprietor, \u00a31, 8s. 2\u00bdd.\n\nFor police purposes, the District is divided into 15 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), and 16 subordinate stations (chauk\u00eds). Municipalities are established at Jehlam, Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n, Chakw\u00e1l, and Talagang. Their united revenue for the year 1871-72 amounted to \u00a34080, being at the average rate of 1s. 2\u00bdd. per head of population. In 1882, the municipal revenue amounted to \u00a34606, the average incidence of taxation being 1s. 2\u00bdd. per head.\n\nSanitary Aspects. \u2014 Jehlam is, on the whole, a healthy District, though the miners of the Salt Range are subject to several distressing complaints (including fever, ophthalmia, and pulmonary diseases), and are, generally speaking, a sickly-looking and feeble community. Goitre is not uncommon, and guinea-worm causes much trouble on the northern plateau. The chief endemic disease is fever, which settles principally in the plain country around Pind D\u00e1dan Kh\u00e1n. The small-\npox mortality is also unusually high. The total number of deaths recorded in 1872 was 14,772, or 29 per thousand of the population, and in 1882, 19,628, or 33 per thousand. Of these deaths, the proportion due to fever was 19\u00b736 per thousand in 1872, and 25\u00b770 per thousand in 1882. No observations are available with reference to the temperature of the District. The average annual rainfall for a period of 20 years ending 1881, was 24\u00b711 inches. The rainfall in 1881 was only 17\u00b710 inches, or 7\u00b701 inches below the average. [For further information regarding Jehlam, see the Settlement Report of the District, by Mr. A. Brandreth, C.S. (1865); with the Revised Settlement Report, by Major Wace and Mr. R. G. Thomson, C.S. Also the Gazetteer of Jehlam District, published under the authority of the Punjab Government, 1883-84; Census Report of the Punjab for 1881, and the various Provincial and Departmental Administrative Reports from 1880 to 1883.]\n\n**Jehlam.**\u2014Eastern tahsil of Jehlam District, Punjab. Lat. 32\u00b0 18' to 33\u00b0 15' N., long. 73\u00b0 9' to 73\u00b0 50' E. Area, 885 square miles, with 422 towns and villages, and 20,373 houses. Population (1881) 174,169, namely, males 96,479, and females 77,690; average density, 197 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Muhammadans, 152,916; Hindus, 17,465; Sikhs, 3424; 'others,' 364. Number of families, 38,347. Total revenue of the tahsil, \u00a318,865. Of the total area of 559,773 acres assessed for Government land revenue, 179,148 acres were returned as under cultivation in 1878-79. Of the remainder, 102,500 acres were grazing land, 55,200 acres cultivable, but not under tillage, and 222,895 acres uncultivable waste. The administrative staff, including the District head-quarters, consists of a Deputy Commissioner, with a Judicial Assistant, and an Assistant Commissioner, a tahsildar, and a munsif. These officers preside over 5 civil and 4 criminal courts. Number of thanas or police circles, 4; strength of regular police, 104 men, besides 128 village watchmen (chaukidars).\n\n**Jehlam (Jhilam).**\u2014Town, municipality, cantonment, and administrative head-quarters of Jehlam District, Punjab. Lat. 32\u00b0 35' 26\" N., long. 73\u00b0 46' 36\" E. Situated on the northern or right bank of the Jehlam river. The population, including the suburbs and cantonments, which in 1868 was returned at 7393, had increased by 1881 to 21,107, the increase being mainly due to the impetus afforded by the Punjab Northern State Railway, which, prior to the extension of the line to Peshawar, had for many years its terminus at Jehlam. Muhammadans numbered 11,369; Hindus, 7966; Sikhs, 1460; and 'others,' 312. Number of houses, 2318. Municipal income (1882-83), \u00a31843, or 2s. 2\u00bdd. per head of the population (16,634, exclusive of the cantonment).\n\nThe present town of Jehlam is of modern origin, the old town having been on the left or opposite bank of the river. Under Sikh\nrule the place was quite unimportant, being mainly occupied by a settlement of *mull\u00e1s*, and at the time of annexation contained about 500 houses. It was then chosen as the site of a cantonment, and as the head-quarters of the civil administration of the District. For some years it was the seat of the Commissioner of the Division; but in 1850 the head-quarters of the Division were transferred to R\u00e1wal Pindi. Under British rule, Jehlam has steadily advanced in prosperity, and is the entrep\u00f4t for most of the trade of the District. The salt traffic, however, which was the main source of this prosperity, has, since the completion of the Northern Punjab State Railway, been diverted to Lahore, but it has not materially affected the position of Jehlam as a place of commerce.\n\nThe native town is small, and traversed by two main streets at right angles to each other. There are no buildings of note; some of the houses with a river frontage are fairly constructed, but the town is principally composed of low-built mud houses; the streets are well paved and in most cases broad; the drainage and sanitary arrangements are satisfactory, and there is an ample water supply. The town has a good reputation for boat-building. The civil lines and public offices lie about a mile to the north-east of the town. The public buildings comprise the ordinary offices and courts, police station, jail, treasury, charitable dispensary, municipal hall, two *sar\u00e1s* (native inns), and a handsome church (in the cantonment); also a fine public garden, with band-stand, deer-paddock, and lawn-tennis courts. A railway bridge of the Punjab State Railway crosses the Jehlam river at the town.\n\nThe cantonment is situated about a mile south-west of the town, in a desolate barren plain, almost entirely destitute of vegetation, owing to the hard and stony nature of the ground. The military strength of the garrison consisted in August 1883, of 50 regimental and staff officers, a regiment of Native cavalry 537 strong, and one of Native infantry 815 strong. Total population of cantonment (1881) 4473.\n\n**Jejuri.**\u2014Town and municipality in the Purandhar Sub-division of Poona (Pun\u00e1) District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. $18\u00b0\\ 16' N.$, long. $74\u00b0\\ 12' E.$ Population (1881) 3245; municipal revenue (1882\u201383), chiefly derived from a tax on pilgrims of 3d. each, \u00a3303; municipal expenditure, \u00a3292; incidence of municipal taxation per head, 1s. 9d. A place of Hindu pilgrimage.\n\n**Jellasore.**\u2014Town in Balasore District, Bengal.\u2014See Jaleswar.\n\n**Jenkal-betta** ('Honey Rock Hill').\u2014Magnificent peak of the Western Gh\u00e1ts, Hassan District, Mysore State. The precipitous rock is covered with honeycombs. A station of the Great Trigonometrical Survey.\n\n**Jerigurkhadi.**\u2014Native State, Kh\u00e1ndesh Political Agency, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Dang States.\nJerim\u00e1la.\u2014Town in Kudlighi t\u00e1luk of Bellary District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 14\u00b0 48' 40\" N., long. 76\u00b0 33' E. Now of no importance, but in the last century the residence of a family of powerful p\u00e1leg\u00e1rs, descended from Pennappa N\u00e1yak. The territory was reduced by Aurangzeb, who exacted increased tribute and military force. In 1752 the p\u00e1leg\u00e1r of Chitaldr\u00fag conquered all the country belonging to the p\u00e1leg\u00e1r of Jerim\u00e1la, who was obliged to serve the former with 500 peons, and pay tribute through him. When Haidar Ali captured Chitaldr\u00fag in 1767, the Jerim\u00e1la p\u00e1leg\u00e1r appealed to him, but was put to death by the p\u00e1leg\u00e1r of Chitaldr\u00fag. The whole District was resumed by Tip\u00fa in 1787. The members of the p\u00e1leg\u00e1r's family fled, but regained possession of the country in 1791. When Jerim\u00e1la was ceded to the Niz\u00e1m of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Deccan) in 1799, the p\u00e1leg\u00e1r was allowed to rent this tract at its full value. In 1801 the country fell under the dominion of the British, a pension of \u00a3160 being granted to the members of the ruling family for their support. The pension is continued to their descendants.\n\nJerruck (or Jhirak).\u2014Deputy Collectorate and Sub-division of Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 24\u00b0 4' to 25\u00b0 26' 30\" N., long. 67\u00b0 6' 15\" to 68\u00b0 22' 30\" E. Bounded on the north by the Sehw\u00e1n Deputy Collectorate, part of Kohist\u00e1n, and the Baran river; on the east and south by the Indus and its tributaries; on the west by the sea and Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed t\u00e1luk. Area, 2997 square miles, or 1,918,155 acres, of which 96,847 are under cultivation, 121,850 cultivable, and the remainder uncultivable waste. Population (1881) 95,821. The Sub-division is divided into 3 t\u00e1luks\u2014viz. Tatta, M\u00edrpur Sakro, and Ghor\u00e1b\u00e1ri\u2014and sub-divided into 20 tap\u00e1s. It contains 4 towns and 142 villages, only 4 of which have a population exceeding 800.\n\nThe northern portion of the Sub-division consists of a hilly waste, dotted with occasional lakes or dhands; this may also be said of a portion of the eastern side, bordering directly on the Indus, where are the Makli hills and the range on which the town of Jerruck is built; the southern portion stretches out in a flat alluvial plain, broken only by canals and branches of the Indus. Six of the older mouths of the river,\u2014the Piti, Juna, Richhal, Haj\u00e1mro, Kakaiw\u00e1ri, and Khedew\u00e1ri,\u2014besides the Gh\u00e1ro creek, lie within this Sub-division. The Haj\u00e1mro in 1845 was so insignificant a stream as to preclude even small boats passing up; but from that time it began to increase in volume, and is now perhaps the largest mouth of the Indus. There is a beacon, 95 feet high at the eastern side of the entrance, which can be seen from a distance of 25 miles. Two Government pilot-boats are stationed inside the bar. The canals kept clear at Government expense number 49, with an aggregate length of 360 miles, and yield an annual net income of \u00a310,636. The largest of these are the Baghar, Kalri, and\nSian. The zamindari canals number 1321, but are all very small and short. Numerous torrents (nais) cause, after heavy rain, considerable loss of cattle, and occasional damage to the railway running from Kotri to Kar\u00e1chi; while the floods which they produce by overfilling the dhands and canals are at times very serious. The largest of the dhands or lakes are the Kinjhar, Son\u00e1hri, and H\u00e1l\u00e1ji. The climate and public health vary greatly in different parts of the Sub-division, the town of Jerruck itself being particularly salubrious, while Tatta and the country round are notorious for the ague, fever, and dysentery that prevail. Cholera is a not unfrequent and a destructive visitor. The ravages of small-pox have been checked by vaccination. The average yearly rainfall is only $7\\frac{1}{2}$ inches. Sea-fogs prevail over the coast tract to such an extent that wheat cannot be cultivated.\n\nThe geology, fauna, and flora of Jerruck do not differ materially from those of other parts of Kar\u00e1chi District. Geologically, the soil of the Sub-division is alluvial deposit, except in the east and north-west. The wild animals found are the wolf, jackal, fox, hog-deer (pharo), hare, hy\u00e6na, lynx, and leopard. Ibex and ravine antelope are met with in the hilly portion. Among birds are many varieties of the wild duck, geese (among these the kulam), the flamingo, pelican, stork, crane, heron, curlew, and snipe; in the north, partridge, quail, and plover. Varieties of the Saxicola or stone-chat warblers are numerous, and of these the Saxicola aurita is the most beautiful bird, as regards plumage, to be seen in Sind. Snakes and scorpions are numerous. The dog of the Indus delta is large, and so ferocious as to make it dangerous for a stranger to approach. The bees of Haj\u00e1mro are remarkable for the excellence of their honey, and for their curious habit of affixing their combs to maritime plants. Extraordinary numbers of field rats are found, which at times do incredible mischief to the crops. The rats construct granaries underground, and the cultivators, when grain is scarce, often dig up the stores. The one-humped camel is numerous; the delta-bred camel is smaller and lighter in limb than his Arabian congener. The Karm\u00e1ti tribe breed a valuable description of camel. As elsewhere in Sind, the babul (Acacia arabica) is the principal forest tree. The forests cover a total area of 25,074 acres; and yielded in 1873\u201374 a revenue, from grazing fees, sales of firewood, charcoal, etc., babul pods for fodder, and cultivation of land within forest limits, of \u00a31425. The forests were all planted between 1795 and 1828, by the Talpur M\u00edrs. The fisheries are 20 in number, yielding an average annual revenue of \u00a3305. The right of fishing is yearly sold by auction to the highest bidder.\n\nThe population of the Sub-division in 1872 was 92,902; and in 1881, 95,821, namely, males 52,451, and females 43,370. Classified according to religion in 1881, there were\u2014Muhammadans, 82,506;\nHindus, 11,788; Sikhs, 1,428; aboriginal tribes, 40; Christians, 38; Jews, 10; and Parsis, 11. In character, habits, dress, etc., the people of Jerruck do not differ from those of the rest of Kar\u00e1chi District.\n\nThe administrative and revenue staff consists of a Deputy Collector and first-class Magistrate, assisted by 3 mukht\u00ed\u00e1rk\u00e1rs, with the powers of a second-class magistrate; 2 kotw\u00e1ls, who have certain magisterial powers, and supervise the jails; and 20 tap\u00e1dd\u00e1rs, or excise officers. The only jails are the two subordinate lock-ups at Tatta and Keti. There are ten cattle-pounds. The Sub-division contained (1884) 8 criminal courts, 24 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00eds), and 170 regular police. The civil suits (1874) numbered 359, involving a total amount of \u00a33698; only three of the whole were for land, value \u00a342.\n\nThe revenue of the Sub-division in 1873\u201374 was \u00a321,077, being \u00a318,489 imperial and \u00a32,588 local, derived as follows:\u2014Imperial\u2014land-tax, \u00a314,815; abk\u00e1ri or excise, \u00a31354; stamps, \u00a3734; postal department, \u00a391; law and justice, \u00a3302; miscellaneous, \u00a31193. Local\u2014cesses on land and sayer or customs, \u00a3967; percentage on alienated lands, \u00a348; pounds and ferries funds, \u00a3916; fisheries, \u00a3657. The Topographical Survey was completed in 1870, and a temporary settlement has been introduced in the Tatta t\u00e1luk. Land is held on provisional or temporary leases in the two other t\u00e1lukas, the rate per acre ranging from 8s. for mahsuli (garden) land, 4s. for charkhi, 3s. for s\u00e1ilab\u00ed and mok (flooded lands), 2s. for bar\u00e1ni (rain-irrigated) lands. The water-rate is \u00bdd. per acre. The alienated land occupies an area of 96,000 acres, 21,000 of which are cultivated, and is distributed among 54 j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs. The seri grants number 13, covering 250 acres; the number of m\u00e1fid\u00e1rs is 17.\n\nThere are 2 municipalities within the Sub-division, viz. Tatta and Keti, with an aggregate annual income (1882\u201383) of \u00a31786. The number of Government schools is 7, with 645 pupils. There are dispensaries at Jerruck, Tatta, and Keti.\n\nTwo crops are reaped annually, the khar\u00edf and rab\u00ed. Three-fourths of the whole cultivated area are under rice, and the remainder is divided in the usual proportions among the ordinary crops. The only speciality is the san (Crotalaria juncea), grown for its fibre, of which nets and fishing gear are made. Fishing is carried on in the Indus and in the dh\u00e1unds. The fish caught are pala, the larger and coarser river fish, and prawns. Rights of fishing are sold annually by auction to the highest bidder.\n\nThe trade of Jerruck is chiefly in agricultural products, the principal mart being Keti, whence exports of the value of about \u00a3280,000 are annually made. The rest of the Sub-division imports cotton cloth, metal work, spices, fruits, sugar, and grain; and exports agricultural produce and skins. The manufactures, though once of some\nreputation\u2014notably the Tatta chintzes and glazed pottery\u2014now are of very small importance. More than 40 fairs are held in the Sub-division; 19 of the largest have an average attendance of 980, and last for a period of from one to fifteen days.\n\nThe roads of the Sub-division aggregate nearly 360 miles in length, 270 miles being trunk and postal lines. The great military road from Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed to Kotri runs, via Tatta, through the northern portion of Jerruck. There are here 20 dharms\u00e1l\u00e1s. The ferries number 36, yielding annually about \u00a3400. The Indus Valley or Sind Railway passes through the Sub-division for about 63 miles, with 6 stations, at Ran Pethani, Jangsh\u00e1hi, Jan\u00e1b\u00e1d, Jhimp\u00edr, Meting, and Bol\u00e1ri. The telegraph line follows the railway route. There are 3 postal lines, with 5 non-disbursing and 3 branch offices.\n\nThe chief objects of antiquarian interest in the Jerruck Sub-division are the ruins of Bh\u00e1mboore, a very ancient city of the 7th century; the M\u00e1ri, a building of the 14th century; the Kal\u00e1n Kot (or great fort) ruins, built in the 15th century, it is supposed, upon the site of a still more ancient stronghold. The most interesting remains of old buildings are the many tombs, fast hastening to decay, on the plateau of the Makli range of hills near Tatta. These ruins are described as a vast cemetery extending over 6 square miles, containing not less than a million of tombs, and believed to have been a sacred burial-ground for twelve centuries; among the largest tombs is the modest one of an Englishman, by name Edward Cooke, who died at Tatta in 1743, and who is supposed to have been a private merchant engaged in the silk trade.\n\n**Jerruck** (or **Jhirak**).\u2014Village in the Jerruck Sub-division Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Lat. $25^\\circ 3' 6''$ N., long. $68^\\circ 17' 44''$. Population (1881) under 2000. The trade, since the opening of the Sind Railway diverted traffic from this part of the Indus, has fallen off greatly. Formerly there existed an active traffic with the mountain tribes, who brought sheep to exchange for grain, especially rice. The only local manufacture of marked excellence is that of camel saddles, and of strong and durable susis (or striped cloths). Jerruck stands on an eminence commanding the Indus from both military and commercial points of view; a position so advantageous that Sir Charles Napier regretted not having selected it for the European barracks instead of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyder\u00e1b\u00e1d, Sind). Jerruck has road communication with Kotri 24 miles, with Tatta 32 miles, and with Meting, a station of the Sind Railway, 13 miles. Subordinate court, post-office, and police station; 3 dharms\u00e1l\u00e1s or rest-houses; Government school; subordinate jail; market; and dispensary.\n\n**Jesar.**\u2014Petty State of the P\u00e1ndu Mehw\u00e1s, in Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency. The area is $1\\frac{1}{4}$ square mile. There\nare 4 chiefs or pag\u00eds. The revenue in 1881 was estimated at \u00a340; a tribute of \u00a315 is paid to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda.\n\n**Jessor.**\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between 22\u00b0 48' and 23\u00b0 47' N. lat., and between 88\u00b0 42' and 89\u00b0 52' E. long. Jessor District forms the north-eastern portion of the Presidency Division. It is bounded on the north and west by Nadiy\u00e1 District; on the south by the newly-formed District of Khuln\u00e1; and on the east by the District of Far\u00eddpur. Area (according to the Census of 1881, and from which all percentages and calculations bearing on population have been calculated), 2276 square miles. A later return from the Surveyor-General's Department, dated May 1885, gives the present area at 2925 square miles. Population (1881) 1,577,249 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at Jessor town, locally called Kasb\u00e1, on the Bhairab river.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Jessor forms the central portion of the delta between the H\u00fagl\u00ed and the united Ganges and Brahmaputra. It is a vast alluvial plain intersected by rivers and watercourses, which at places in the southern portion of the District spread out into large marshes. It naturally divides into two parts\u2014one bounded north and west by an imaginary line drawn from Kesabpur village south of Jessor town to Muhammadpur on the Madhumat\u00ed; and a second lying between that line and the southern boundary of the District. The first of these portions is fairly dry, and beyond the reach of the tides; the second or central portion is swampy, and only passable on foot during the dry season. Formerly Jessor District comprised a third well-marked tract known as the Jessor Sundarbans, a tangled network of swamps and rivers, without tillage or population except in scattered reclamation tracts. This fluvial region is now included within the new District of Khulna (*q.v.*), and will be dealt with in a distinct article. Its recent separation must be borne in mind when comparing the present account of Jessor District with previous descriptions. The northern portion of the District is verdant, with extensive groves of date-palms; villages are numerous and large; and the people are prosperous. In the central portion the population is sparse, the only part of the tract suitable for dwellings being the high land along the banks of rivers. The principal rivers of Jessor are\u2014the Madhumat\u00ed (which forms the eastern boundary of the District), with its tributaries the Nabagang\u00e1, Chi\u00e1k, and Bhairab; the Kum\u00e1r, the Kabadak, the Fatki, and the Har\u00edhar. As in all deltaic tracts, the banks of the rivers are higher than the adjacent country. These river banks are covered in Jessor with villages and clumps of date-palms, which form a very characteristic feature in the scenery of the District. Within the last century, the rivers in the interior of Jessor have ceased to be true deltaic rivers; and whereas the northern portion\nof the District formerly lay under water for several months every year, it is now reached only by unusual inundations. The Madhumat\u00ed and the Nabagang\u00e1 are the only rivers which form considerable chars, or alluvial sandbanks. The tide reaches as far north as the latitude of Jessur town.\n\nHistory.\u2014The name Jessur is a corruption of Yashohara, which means 'fame-depriving;' and the origin of this title is thus explained. At the court of D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n, the last Path\u00e1n king of Bengal, a certain R\u00e1j\u00e1 named Vikram\u00e1ditya held a high post. When the king was defeated by Akbar, Vikram\u00e1ditya obtained a grant in the Sundarbans; and in that safe retreat held a large tract of country by force of arms, and established a new city, to which he took so much of the wealth and splendour of Gaur\u2014part of it D\u00e1\u00fad\u2019s property\u2014that he was said to have deprived the old capital of its fame. Vikram\u00e1ditya was succeeded in the principality of Jessur by his son Prat\u00e1paditya, the popular hero of the Sundarbans, who gained pre-eminence over the twelve lords then holding possession of the southern part of Bengal along the coast, but he was eventually defeated and captured by M\u00e1n Singh.\n\nThe R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Jessur or Ch\u00e1nchr\u00e1 trace their origin to Bh\u00e1beswar R\u00e1i, a soldier in the army of Kh\u00e1n-i-Azam, an imperial general, who deprived R\u00e1j\u00e1 Prat\u00e1paditya of several fiscal divisions (pargan\u00e1s), and conferred them on Bh\u00e1beswar. On the death of the latter in 1588, his son Maht\u00e1b R\u00e1m R\u00e1i (1588\u20131619) succeeded him. During the war between M\u00e1n Singh and Prat\u00e1paditya, which ended, as has been said, in the defeat and capture of the latter, Maht\u00e1b R\u00e1m R\u00e1i assisted M\u00e1n Singh, and at the close he retained the pargan\u00e1s made over to his predecessor. To him succeeded Kandarp\u00e1 R\u00e1i (1619\u201349), who added considerably to the estates; and he in turn was followed by Manohar R\u00e1i (1649\u2013705), who is regarded as the principal founder of the family. The estate, when he inherited it, was of moderate size, but he acquired one pargan\u00e1 after another until, at his death, the property was by far the largest in the neighbourhood. On the death of Manohar, the estate went to Krishna R\u00e1m (1705\u201329), who was followed by Sukh Deb R\u00e1i (1729\u201345). The latter divided the estate into a three-quarters share and a one-quarter share, the former being called the Yusafpur, and the latter the Sayyidpur estate. The latter was given by Sukh Deb to his brother Sy\u00e1m Sundar, who died without issue, leaving it vacant. It was afterwards conferred by the East India Company upon a landholder (who had been dispossessed by the Naw\u00e1b of Bengal), in order that he might make a grant to the Company of certain lands near Calcutta. The possessor of the property in 1814, Hajj\u00ed Muhammad Moshin (who died the same year), made over the estate in trust for the H\u00fagl\u00ed Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, which has ever since enjoyed its revenues. The Yusafpur estate was inherited in 1764 by Sr\u00edk\u00e1nt R\u00e1i, who, at the time of the Permanent Settlement,\nlost pargan\u00e1 after pargan\u00e1 until his family was left destitute and forced to fall back upon the bounty of the Government. To Srik\u00e1nt succeeded, in 1802, B\u00e1nik\u00e1nt, who died in 1817. His son Barad\u00e1k\u00e1nt, being a minor, the property was administered by the Court of Wards, who greatly increased its value. In 1823, the Government added to the estate the confiscated pargan\u00e1 of S\u00e1hos, and since then has bestowed on the proprietor the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bah\u00e1dur in recognition of services rendered during the Mutiny. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Barad\u00e1k\u00e1nt died in 1880, leaving three sons, the eldest of whom, Ganynada Kant, succeeded to the title and estates.\n\nBritish administration was completely established in the District in 1781, when the Governor-General ordered the opening of a court at Murali, near Jessor town. Previous to this, however, the revenue or financial administration (diw\u00e1n\u00ed) had been in the hands of the English, having been transferred to the East India Company with that of the rest of Bengal in 1765. The first Judge and Magistrate of the District was Mr. Henckell, who founded the market called after him, Henckellganj, and was the first to urge upon the Government the scheme of Sundarbans reclamation. (See Sundarbans.) To Mr. Henckell succeeded, in 1789, Mr. Rocke, who transferred the civil station from Murali to Jessor, where it still remains. Among the list of Collectors of Jessor is found the name of Mr. R. Thackeray, father of the novelist, who acted in that capacity for a few months in 1805.\n\nThe changes in jurisdiction in the District of Jessor have been very numerous. When first constituted, the magisterial jurisdiction extended over the present Districts of Faridpur and Jessor, and also included that portion of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s which lies to the east of the Ichh\u00e1m\u00e1t\u00ed. After many transfers and rectifications of boundary, the District was in 1882 finally reduced to its present dimensions, the Sub-divisions of Khuln\u00e1 and B\u00e1ghirh\u00e1t in the south being erected into the new District of Khulna (q.v.).\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of the present area of the District of Jessor, as returned by the Census of 1872, was 1,451,507 persons. In 1881, the population was ascertained to be 1,577,249, showing an increase of 125,742, or 8\u00b766 per cent., in the nine years since 1872. The average pressure of the population on the soil throughout the District is 693 persons to the square mile; number of houses per square mile, 101\u00b774; persons per house, 6\u00b796. The density of the population varies greatly in different parts of the District; being high in the northern portions, and dwindling as we proceed southwards through the more recently inhabited tracts. Of the total population, 779,805 are males and 797,444 females; proportion of males, 49\u00b79 per cent. Classified according to age, there are, under 15 years old\u2014males 324,354, and females 297,628; total children, 621,982, or 39\u00b74\nper cent.: 15 years and upwards\u2014males 455,451, and females 499,816; total adults, 955,267, or 60\u00b76 per cent. The excessive proportion of male children is explained by the fact, that the natives of India consider that a girl reaches womanhood at an earlier age than a boy arrives at manhood; many girls are consequently returned as women. As regards religious distinctions, Hindus number 631,439, or 40\u00b70 per cent. of the total population, while Muhammadans number 945,297, or 59\u00b79 per cent., chiefly belonging to the lower classes. The number of Christians is 474, of whom 383 are native converts. There are 7 missionary stations in the District. The Br\u00e1hma Sam\u00e1j has a few adherents, returned at 39 in number.\n\nOf the higher castes of Hindus, Br\u00e1hmans number 37,752; and R\u00e1jputs, 903. Among the intermediate classes is the most numerous caste in the District, namely, K\u00e1yasths (writers, etc.), who number 62,611. Of the lower ranks of the Hindu community, the fishing and boating castes deserve special mention. The fisheries in the rivers and deeper swamps are very valuable, and the right to fish is a regular tenure paid for like the right to cultivate land. The number of Hindus of fishing and boating castes, such as Jal\u00edy\u00e1s, Kaibarttas, Mallahs, Pods, etc., in Jessor is 78,002, or 5 per cent. of the population; and the number of Muhammadans who follow the same occupations is probably even greater. Jessor is noted for a colony of pure Kulin Br\u00e1hmans, who live at Lakshm\u00edp\u00e1s\u00e1, a village 10 miles east of Nar\u00e1l on the right bank of the Nabagang\u00e1, where that river joins the Bank\u00e1na. These Kulins trace their origin to Ram\u00e1nanda Chakrabartt\u00fa, who, five generations ago, emigrated from Sarmangal near K\u00e1l\u00ed\u00e1 in B\u00e1karganj, a great Kulin settlement.\n\nTowns, in the ordinary sense of the word, can scarcely be said to exist in the District. The only three places with a population of more than 5000 are JESSOR town (population, 8495), KOTCHANDPUR (9231), and KESABPUR (6405), which are also the only municipalities in the District. There are, according to the Census of 1881, 235 towns containing from 1000 to 5000 inhabitants (of which 213 contain fewer than 2000); 761 with between 500 and 1000 inhabitants; and 2988 with fewer than 500 inhabitants. Kotch\u00e1ndpur is the largest, and Kesabpur the second largest, trading place in the District, with numerous sugar-refineries, and a large trade in earthen vessels and brass-work of local manufacture. Other towns, or large villages\u2014Naldang\u00e1, the residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of that name; Chaug\u00e1chh\u00e1, Magur\u00e1, Jhanidah, Ch\u00e1ndkh\u00e1l\u00ed, Kh\u00e1jur\u00e1, and Binodpur, all considerable trading villages; Muhammadpur, on the right bank of the Madhunat\u00ed, founded in the end of the 17th century, and containing many interesting remains of antiquity; Nar\u00e1l, the seat of the first family of landholders in the District; Lakshm\u00edp\u00e1s\u00e1, to which reference has already been made as the residence of a settle-\nment of Kulin Br\u00e1hmans, and which is also a trading place. Descriptions of most of these places will be found in their alphabetical order in this work, and a detailed account of them is given in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. ii. pp. 201-239.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The staple crop in Jessur is rice, of which there are three harvests\u2014\u00e1man, \u00e1us, and boro. The times of sowing and reaping vary in different parts of the District. In the north, \u00e1man or winter rice is sown in April and May, and reaped in November or December; in the Sundarbans it is sown in April and reaped in January. The land for this crop is ploughed four times before sowing, and, except in marsh lands, the young shoots are transplanted in July. For \u00e1us rice the ground is ploughed five or six times, the seed is sown on higher ground, there is no transplanting, and the land yields a second crop. Boro rice land is hardly ploughed at all; the seed is scattered broadcast in the marshes as they dry up; and the shoots are transplanted when a month old, and sometimes again a month later. Among the other crops of the District are barley, Indian corn, peas, mustard, jute, tobacco, potatoes, sugar-cane, indigo, p\u00e1n, dates, etc.\n\nThere are no accurate statistics regarding the extent of land under cultivation, or the out-turn of the crops. According to the estimates before the separation of Khuln\u00e1 District, and the rectification of the Jessur boundaries in 1882, more than a million acres were under rice, 43,200 under oil-seeds, 10,600 under barley, 52,100 under pulses, and 236,000 acres under other crops\u2014making a total cultivated area of 1,381,800 acres. These figures must, however, be considered as only approximately correct; and, even as regards the old area, they were subject to changes owing to the increase and variations in the cultivated area since they were framed.\n\nThe estimated area covered by date-palms for the manufacture of sugar is 17,500 acres. The trees do not commence bearing until they are six or seven years old, but afterwards they continue bearing for about thirty years. The juice is collected from November to February. A tree in good bearing will produce 5 cwt. of juice, from which 84 lbs. of molasses or g\u00far, yielding about 30 lbs. of sugar, may be made; an acre would yield about 3 tons of sugar, valued at from \u00a350 to \u00a360.\n\nThe area under indigo in Jessur has been estimated at 31,333 acres, and the total estimated produce for the season 1872-73 was 203 tons, valued at \u00a3114,400. In 1856, the area under indigo was greater by upwards of 30,000 acres; but a large number of factories were closed in consequence of the disturbances of 1859 to 1861, of which some account will be found in the article on Nadiya District. At present the number of European factories throughout the District is about 55, besides 50 worked in the interest of native proprietors under European or native management. There are two methods of cultivation\u2014one\nby hired factory labour (the nij or kh\u00e1m\u00e1r system), and the other by husbandmen who contract to cultivate the plant for the factory. Under the former system, the factory provides the means of cultivation, the total expense amounting to about 18s. an acre; under the latter system, the grower receives an advance of 12s. to 18s. an acre, and is supplied with seed, but bears all the other expenses of cultivation. There are two seasons for indigo sowing\u2014namely, autumn (October) and spring (April); the latter crop is more precarious, but also more abundant than the former.\n\nAmong the land tenures of the District, the mukarr\u00e1ri or permanent tenures in Naldi pargan\u00e1 deserve special notice. Rates of rent vary in Jessor according to the description and position of the land, from 9d. an acre for rice land, to \u00a31, 16s. an acre for p\u00e1n land. The rate for ordinary rice land throughout the District is about 6s. an acre.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Blight occur occasionally, but rarely to any serious extent. The District is, as might be expected, subject to heavy floods, which have sometimes been immediately followed by disastrous cyclones. At the end of last century, inundations happened every two or three years; but in consequence of the silting up of several of the rivers in the north, the waters which formerly overflowed that part of the District now find a wide channel in the Madhumati, and floods are comparatively rare. Among recent inundations, those of 1838, 1847, 1856, and 1871 are the most memorable, that first mentioned (1838) having been specially severe. Formerly, the keeping up of the numerous embankments was one of the Collector's most important duties; now, owing to the changes in river-beds already referred to, embankments have become almost useless. Drought is not common in Jessor, and the famines with which the District has been visited have been perhaps more often due to floods. The only serious drought within the memory of the present generation was that of 1866. During the scarcity which followed, the maximum price of ordinary paddy was 15 lbs., and of rice 10 lbs., for a shilling.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The trade of Jessor is carried on chiefly by means of permanent markets, but there is also considerable traffic at the numerous fairs and religious gatherings held throughout the District. The chief exports are sugar\u2014both dhuln\u00e1 (half-refined) and pak\u00e1 (white, granular)\u2014indigo, rice, pulse; and, from the Sundarbans, timber, honey, shells, etc. The principal imports are salt, English piece-goods, and hardware. The exports greatly exceed the imports in value. The certificate-tax of 1868 estimated the trading profit of the District at \u00a3320,000. The principal manufactures of Jessor are date-sugar and indigo. Throughout the north and west of the District, the husbandmen depend more upon date cultivation than upon any other branch of agriculture; and several towns and large villages are\naltogether supported by sugar manufacture. A very interesting and clear account of the cultivation of the date and the manufacture of sugar is given in Mr. Westland's Report on Jessore (to which this article is throughout much indebted), and quoted in the Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. ii. pp. 280-298. The area which would be occupied by all the date-trees in the District, if they were placed together, has been estimated at 17,500 acres, and the produce of sugar per acre at nearly 3 tons, valued at from \u00a350 to \u00a360. The same causes which have led to the decline of indigo cultivation in Nadiya District, have affected Jessore in a similar way. The area under this crop in 1870 was 84 square miles; in 1872-73, it had fallen to 49 square miles. A well-known Bengali newspaper, the Amrit\u00e1 B\u00e1z\u00e1r Patrik\u00e1, was formerly published in this District at the village of Amrit\u00e1 B\u00e1z\u00e1r, but has since been removed to Calcutta.\n\nThe Means of Communication in Jessore consist of numerous rivers and waterways, with several lines of metalled road, and many tracks for bullock carts. The Bengal Central Railway now (1884) runs through the District. It describes a great curve to the northward, with Calcutta at the south-western end, the new District head-quarters of Khuln\u00e1 at its south-eastern extremity, and Jessore town at its northernmost point between. The total distance from Calcutta (Sialda terminus) to Khuln\u00e1 is 109 miles; Jessore town being 74 miles from Calcutta and 35 from Khuln\u00e1. The Bengal Central line starts, strictly speaking, from Dum-Dum junction, 6 miles north of Calcutta, on the Eastern Bengal Railway.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Reference has already been made to the numerous changes which have taken place in the jurisdiction of Jessore, and these must be borne in mind in comparing the revenue and expenditure at different periods. In 1787-88, the revenue amounted to \u00a380,728, and the expenditure on civil administration to \u00a36400. In 1868-69, the total revenue of the District was returned at \u00a3117,185, and the total civil expenditure at \u00a334,993, showing an increase in the eighty years of 45 per cent. in revenue, and of 500 per cent. in expenditure. In 1876-77, the total revenue had increased to \u00a3177,473; but since the curtailment of the District in 1882, by the erection of the southern sub-divisions into the independent jurisdiction of the new Khulna District (q.v.), it has decreased to \u00a3131,643. The land-tax supplies by far the greatest proportion of the revenue. It was very much the same in amount in 1881-82 as it was in 1790, when the area of the District was much larger than at present. Since 1882 it has decreased proportionately with the lessened area of the District. The revenue given above for the year 1787-88 (\u00a380,728) was derived entirely from the land.\n\nSub-division of property has gone on very rapidly under British rule. In 1790, the number of estates on the rent-roll of the then much larger\nDistrict was 46, held by 57 proprietors or coparceners, who paid a total land revenue of \u00a3102,178, equal to an average payment of \u00a32221 from each estate and \u00a31792 from each individual proprietor or coparcener. In 1871, the number of estates was 2844, paying a total land revenue of \u00a3104,519, equal to an average payment of \u00a336, 15s. from each estate. There are now (1883) 2828 estates paying a revenue of \u00a368,239, or an average of \u00a324, 2s. 6d. from each estate.\n\nProtection to person and property has increased not less rapidly. In 1781 there were only 2 magisterial and 2 civil courts in the District. In 1850 there were 4 magisterial and 19 civil courts, with 6 European officers stationed in the District. In 1883 (after the separation of Khuln\u00e1) the number of magisterial courts was 11, and of civil courts (including honorary magistrates) 17. For police purposes Jessor is divided into 11 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles, with 10 outpost stations. The regular District police consisted in 1882\u201383 of 376 men of all ranks, maintained at a cost of \u00a36109. In addition to these, there was a municipal force of 45 men, costing \u00a3355, and a village watch of 2964 men, costing in money and lands an estimated sum of \u00a310,500. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property in Jessor consisted in that year of 3385 officers and men, or 1 man to every 0\u00b767 square mile of the area, or to every 466 of the population. The total cost of maintaining this force was \u00a319,064, equal to a charge of \u00a38, 7s. 6d. per square mile, or 3d. per head of the population. Jessor had at one time a very unenviable notoriety for d\u00e1k\u00e1\u00edti or gang robbery, but this crime has now been almost stamped out. There is one jail in the District, with three subsidiary lock-ups; average daily jail population in 1882, 293\u00b76.\n\nEducation has made rapid progress in Jessor of late years. In 1856\u201357, there were 6 Government and aided schools, attended by 454 pupils. In 1860\u201361, the number of such schools was 9, with 555 pupils; and in 1870\u201371, the number of these schools had increased to 390, and of pupils to 12,349. In addition to these, there were 188 private schools, with an estimated attendance of 3538 pupils. In 1882, there were, as reported by the Collector, 3 Government English schools attended by 375 pupils, 287 attending the District high school at Jessor town; 6 aided high English schools, with 789 pupils; and 11 aided middle English schools, with 661 pupils; 18 middle vernacular aided schools, with 1074 pupils; 10 circle schools, with 395 pupils; 4 girls' aided schools, with 94 pupils; 138 'stipendiary' p\u00e1ts\u00e1l\u00e1s, with 5520 pupils; and 519 'result system' p\u00e1ts\u00e1l\u00e1s, with 14,915 pupils. Total, 709 Government or aided schools, with 23,823 pupils. There are also a number of indigenous schools for which no returns are available; and the Census Report of 1881 showed 27,489 boys and 786 girls as under instruction, besides\n55,742 adult males and 854 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. In the Education Returns, and as regards some other statistics given in the foregoing paragraphs, it must always be remembered that the present District has been diminished by the separation in 1882 of Khulna District (q.v.). In the population returns due allowance has been made for this reduction of area; but in some of the other statistics, materials are not yet available for making the necessary corrections.\n\nMedical Aspects, etc.\u2014The climate of Jessore does not differ from that of the other Districts of Lower Bengal. April, May, and June are here, as elsewhere, very trying, the average mean temperature for these months being $83.6^\\circ$ F., which is very slightly above the monthly mean for July and August. The mean temperature in November is $72^\\circ$; in December, $64.9^\\circ$; and in February, $70.8^\\circ$. Average annual rainfall, for a period of 25 years ending 1881, 68.4 inches. Rainfall in 1882-83, 65.6 inches. Malarious diseases are, as might be expected from the nature of the country, very prevalent, intermittent fever being common throughout the year. Cholera, which is endemic during the hot season, sometimes breaks out also in October and November. The total number of deaths registered in the District in 1883 was 52,448, at the rate of 27.04 per thousand of the population. The deaths due to fever alone numbered 44,667. There are 6 charitable dispensaries in the District, which in 1882 afforded medical relief to 333 in-door and 15,128 out-door patients.

Westland's District Report on Jessore; the Bengal Census Report for 1881; and the Annual Provincial and Departmental Administration Reports from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nJessore.\u2014Head-quarters Sub-division of Jessore District, Bengal. Lat. $22^\\circ 49'$ to $23^\\circ 27'$ N., long. $89^\\circ 1' 45\"$ to $89^\\circ 28' 45\"$ E. Area, 889 square miles; villages, 1,493; houses, 102,138. Population (1872) 590,283; (1881) 628,939, namely, males 317,539, and females 311,400. Total increase of population in nine years, 38,656, or 6.55 per cent. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 211,006; Muhammadans, 417,527; Christians, 367; and 'others,' 39. Number of persons per square mile, 707; villages per square mile, 1.68; houses per square mile, 117; inmates per house, 6.16; proportion of males to total population, 50.5 per cent. In 1883, the Sub-division contained 12 magisterial and revenue courts; 6 police circles; a regular police force 253 strong, and a village watch of 1,244 men.\n\nJessore (also called Kasba).\u2014Chief town of Jessore District, Bengal, and administrative head-quarters of the District; situated on the Bhairab\nriver, in lat. $23^\\circ 10' 5''$ N., long. $89^\\circ 15' 15''$ E. Population (1872) 8152; (1881) 8495, namely, 4511 Hindus, 3822 Muhammadans, and 162 'others.' Municipal income (1882), \u00a31276; incidence of taxation, 2s. 11d. per head of population within municipal limits. The town was till lately of no commercial importance, and no special manufacture is carried on. The bazar merely supplied the town and its vicinity. But the Central Bengal Railway, which now connects Jessor town with Calcutta on the south-west (74 miles) and Khulna on the south-east (35 miles), has already (1884) given a stimulus to Jessor as a local centre for country produce and imports: an impulse which is probably destined to increase still further in future years the commercial importance of the town. In addition to the usual public offices, jail, school-house, etc., Jessor has a small public library, church with parsonage attached, two cemeteries, and a charity hospital. A temple in the neighbourhood, founded in 1813, contains an image of Raghu-nath, and is maintained by an endowment of \u00a3410 per annum.\n\nBesides the town proper, the villages of Purana, Kasba, Baghahar, Sankarpur, and Chanchara lie within the municipal limits. They are chiefly inhabited by people connected with the courts and public offices, or employed by the residents of the town. The residence of the Rajas of Jessor (see Jessore District) is at Chanchara, a mile south of the town. The palace was once surrounded by a rampart and fosse, of which only the remains are now traceable. Near the palace is a large tank, dug by one of the Rajas, and called the Chor-mara ('thief-beating') tank. It is said that the Raja's jail was close to the tank, hence its name.\n\n**Jethwar.**\u2014A Division or Pranth of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r.\u2014See Barda.\n\n**Jetpur Bilkha.**\u2014Native State in Sor\u00e1th Division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency, consisting of 2 towns and 142 villages, and 18,295 occupied houses, with 17 separate tribute-payers or idulukd\u00e1s (Kath\u00eds of the V\u00e1la tribe).

It is bounded on the north by Kushalgarh, Rattam, and S\u00e1il\u00e1na States; east by Dhar and Amjhira; south by Al\u00ed Rajpur and Jobat; and west by the Dohad and Jh\u00e1lod Sub-divisions of the Panch Mah\u00e1ls.\n\nJh\u00e1bua is said to derive its name from having been about two centuries and a half ago the residence of Jh\u00e1b\u00fa N\u00e1ik, a celebrated Bhil freebooter, who infested these hills and built a small fort here. The present chief is a R\u00e1htor R\u00e1jput, and a lineal descendant of a younger branch of the ancient R\u00e1htor chiefs of Jodhpur. One of his ancestors, Kishan D\u00e1s, did good service to the Emperor of Delhi, Al\u00e1-ud-din, in restoring his authority in Bengal, and punishing the Ishil chiefs of Jh\u00e1bua, who had murdered the family of a governor of Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t). The whole of the possessions of the conquered Bhil chiefs were granted to him as a\nreward, with high titles and royal insignia. Thus things continued until the invasion of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, when Holkar seized some of the finest Districts, and so crippled the State, that in 1817 its revenue had become almost nominal. It is remarkable, however, that Holkar left to its rulers the right to collect in these Districts the chauth or fourth part of the revenues which the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s exacted from the country that they conquered. There are about twenty families of rank in Jh\u00e1bua State, who pay \u00a31500 a year in tribute to Holkar, and \u00a32500 to their own chief. In lieu of the tribute of \u00a33500, which Holkar claimed from Jh\u00e1bua, lands were assigned to him, through the mediation of the British Government. The R\u00e1j\u00e1, though then only 15 years of age, did good service during the Mutiny of 1857. The gross revenue of the State is (1882-83) \u00a314,710, and the expenditure \u00a313,979. The chief is entitled to a salute of eleven guns.\n\nThe Jh\u00e1bua possessions, formerly of considerable extent and value, are now comprised within very narrow limits. What remains to the State may be described as a mountainous and woody tract, consisting chiefly of extensive ranges of hills, seldom abrupt or rising to any great height, and covered for the most part with thick jungle of small but valuable timber trees, chiefly teak and blackwood. These ranges, as a rule, run nearly north and south, at distances from each other varying from 1 to 5 or 6 miles. The intermediate valleys are watered by numerous rivulets, tributaries of the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), the Mahi, and the An\u00e1s. The last especially, taking its rise in the south, and running through the centre of the State, with its several branches and feeders, contributes greatly to the fertility of Jh\u00e1bua. The cultivator in these valleys is able to raise a second or \u2018dry\u2019 crop, an advantage unknown in many of the southern and eastern parts of the State. The soil is for the most part good, and repays with little culture the toil of the cultivator. The hills abound with minerals, especially iron and copper ores; but these, for want of skill or industry, are comparatively valueless.\n\nThe population in 1875 was estimated to number 55,000, chiefly Bhils and Bhil\u00e1las of the agricultural class, a hardy, industrious, but wild race. The Census of 1881 returns the population (exclusive of Ratannal) at 92,938, namely, 47,943 males and 44,995 females, dwelling in 785 villages. According to religion the people are thus distributed: \u2014Hindus, 40,094, or nearly 43 per cent.; Muhammadans, 2275; Jains, 2027; Sikhs, 10; aboriginal tribes, 48,531; and Christian, 1. Two towns have between two and three thousand inhabitants. The products of the State are more than sufficient for the needs of the inhabitants. The surplus, chiefly gram and, in the southern and plain Districts, wheat, is exchanged for the numerous articles of necessity or luxury which the neighbouring Province of Gujar\u00e1t affords. The prin-\ncipal rain crops are Indian corn, rice, k\u00fara, m\u00fag, urid, badli, and samli. The 'dry' or second crops are gram and wheat. Small quantities of cotton and poppy are raised, but only in two or three places, and not sufficient for home consumption. In the Pitlaw\u00e1r and other Districts in the plains, sugar-cane is grown to a considerable extent. The gardens produce ginger, garlic, onions, and most of the vegetables common to the rest of M\u00e1lw\u00e1. In the greater part of this State, as in most hilly and Bh\u00edl Districts,\u2014the soil not admitting of regular cultivation, but merely of patches in the more fertile parts.\u2014instead of admeasurement or regular allotments of ground, the system has been adopted of taxing the cultivator according to the number of pairs of bullocks used by him in agriculture. The whole of the revenue duties and village government are in the hands of the hereditary Bh\u00edl p\u00e1tels or head-men. The State pays \u00a3147 towards the cost of the M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Bh\u00edl corps.\n\nThere are dispensaries and schools in three towns, viz. Jh\u00e1bua, R\u00e1n\u00e1pur, and Kandla; also a school at Rambh\u00e1pur. Education, however, is neglected, and the schools are very inefficient. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jh\u00e1bua maintains a military force of 50 horse and 200 foot. There are three fair-weather roads: (1) from Indore via Dhar and Al\u00ed Rajpur to Gujar\u00e1t, passing through P\u00e1r\u00e1 Rajla and Kan\u00e1s; (2) from Rattam via Dohad to Gujar\u00e1t, passing through Pitl\u00e1war and Thaundla; (3) a branch road from Pitl\u00e1war via Thaundla, Jh\u00e1bua, and R\u00e1n\u00e1pur to Gujar\u00e1t. Along all of these roads water is scarce during the hot season.\n\nJh\u00e1bua.\u2014Chief town of the Jh\u00e1bua State, under the Bhop\u00e1war Agency of Central India; situated in lat. 22\u00b0 45' N., and long. 74\u00b0 38' E., on the route from Mau (Mhow) to Jh\u00e1lod, 82 miles west of the former, and 36 south-west of the latter. The town is enclosed by a mud wall, with circular bastions of masonry, and stands on the margin of a small lake in a valley lying at the eastern base of a ridge of hills. On the north bank is the R\u00e1j\u00e1's residence rising above the town, and some temples; and on the opposite side is a fine grove of trees, whilst behind the palace and town rises a hill covered with low jungle. Jh\u00e1bua consists of tortuous, uneven, and steep streets. By the lake is a memorial of the death of the present (1882) chief's father, killed 40 years ago by lightning while seated on his elephant. The town is unhealthy. Dispensary, post-office, and school.\n\nJhajhar.\u2014Town in Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 28\u00b0 16' N., long. 77\u00b0 42' 15\" E. Distant from Bulandshahr town 15 miles south-west. Population (1881) 4151. Founded by Sayyid Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, a Baluch who accompanied Hun\u00e1y\u00fan in his raid, and made the town a refuge for runaways and outcasts. His descendants in the ninth generation still own the soil. Before the Mutiny, Jhajhar supplied the light cavalry with many Baluch recruits. It is now a mean, poverty-stricken town, with a post-office, police station, village\nschool. A house-tax is levied to provide for conservancy, and for the watch and ward of the town.\n\n**Jhajjar.**\u2014Southern *tahsil* of Rohtak District, Punjab, consisting of a somewhat sandy plain, growing marshy as it approaches the Najafgarh *jhil*, and intersected by minor watercourses. Area, 469 square miles, with 181 towns and villages, and 16,378 houses. Population (1881) 112,485, namely, males 60,135, and females 52,350. Average density, 240 per square mile. Number of families, 23,972. Hindus and Sikhs numbered 97,675; Muhammadans, 24,703; Jains, 104; and Christians, 3. Total number of towns and villages, 181, of which 112 contained less than five hundred inhabitants; 43 from five hundred to a thousand; 20 from one to two thousand; and 6 upwards of two thousand. Of a total area of 289,249 acres in 1879, at the time of the revised settlement, 213,268 acres were returned as under cultivation, of which 27,592 acres were irrigated from wells, or by natural inundation. Of the remaining area, 8269 acres lay fallow; 48,341 acres were cultivable, but not under tillage; 17,387 acres were uncultivable waste; and 10,991 acres were held revenue free. The average annual area under the principal crops for the five years from 1877-78 to 1881-82, is returned as follows:\u2014B\u00e1jra, 84,872 acres; jo\u00e1r, 34,169 acres; moth, 17,631 acres; barley, 17,514 acres; gram, 11,733 acres; and wheat, 7846 acres. Revenue of the *tahsil* (1883), \u00a322,819. The administrative staff consists of 1 Assistant Commissioner, 1 *tahsild\u00e1r*, and 1 honorary magistrate. These officers preside over 2 civil and 3 criminal courts. Number of police circles (*th\u00e1n\u00e1s*), 2; strength of regular police, 64 men; village watchmen (*chaukid\u00e1rs*), 187. The Riw\u00e1ri-Firozpur Railway passes through the outskirts of the *tahsil*.\n\n**Jhajjar.**\u2014Town and municipality in Rohtak District, Punjab, and head-quarters of Jhajjar *tahsil*; formerly the capital of a Native State, and afterwards the civil station of a British District, now removed to Rohtak. Lat. 28\u00b0 36' 33\" N., long. 76\u00b0 14' 10\" E. Population (1868) 12,617; (1881) 11,650, namely, 6895 Hindus, 4659 Muhammadans, 1 Sikh, 93 Jains, and 2 \u2018others.\u2019 Situated on the plain, 35 miles west of Delhi, and 21 miles south of Rohtak town. The town was founded at the time of the first Muhammadan conquest of Delhi, in 1193. It was almost ruined by the great famine of 1793, but has since regained its prosperity. In 1796, Nij\u00e1b\u00e1t Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n became Naw\u00e1b of Jhajjar. He was son of Murtaza Kh\u00e1n, a Path\u00e1n soldier of fortune under Sh\u00e1h Alam. Together with his two brothers, he took service with Sindhia, from whom they obtained extensive grants, with the titles of Naw\u00e1b of Jhajjar, Bah\u00e1durgarh, and Pataodi. After the British conquest, these grants were confirmed and enlarged. But when the Mutiny broke out,\nAbdul Rahm\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, the reigning Naw\u00e1b, threw off his allegiance, together with his cousin of Bah\u00e1durgarh. Both were captured and tried, and the Naw\u00e1b of Jhajjar was condemned to death, his estates being confiscated by the British Government. A District of Jhajjar was organized out of the new territory, but in 1861 the head-quarters were removed to Rohtak, with which District Jhajjar was incorporated. Small and languishing trade in grain and country produce, the town lying remote from modern trade routes. Considerable manufacture of pottery. Tahsili, police station, post-office, d\u00e1k bungalow, school-house, dispensary. Ruined tanks and tombs surround the town. Municipal revenue in 1882-83, \u00a3630, or 1s. id. per head of population.\n\nJhaknauda.\u2014Town in Jh\u00e1bua State, Bhop\u00e1war Agency, Central India. Large town, situated 15 miles from Sard\u00e1rpur, and 24 miles north-east of Jh\u00e1bua town. The residence of a Th\u00e1kur, one of the principal Umraos; his income is \u00a31000, and he pays an annual tribute of \u00a3311 to the Indore State.\n\nJh\u00e1lak\u00e1t\u00ed (or Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj).\u2014Village and municipality in B\u00e1kar-ganj District, Bengal. Lat. 22\u00b0 38' 30\" N., long. 90\u00b0 15' E.; situated at the junction of the Jh\u00e1lak\u00e1t\u00ed and N\u00e1lchiti rivers. Population (1881) 1463. One of the largest timber markets in Eastern Bengal, especially for the sale of sundr\u00ed wood. Extensive export trade in rice; imports of salt. Municipal revenue (1881-82), \u00a3140; rate of taxation, 11d. per head of population (3000) within municipal limits. Fair held here annually in November at the Diw\u00e1li festival, which is attended by about 8000 persons.\n\nJh\u00e1law\u00e1r.\u2014Native State in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, under the political superintendence of the Haraoti and Tonk Agency, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, Central India. The State consists of three detached tracts. The largest one is bounded on the north by the State of Kotah; on the east by Sindhia's territory and a detached District of the Tonk State; on the south by the petty State of R\u00e1jgarh, outlying portions of the States of Sindhia and Holkar, a detached District of the Dew\u00e1s State, and the State of Jaura (J\u00e1ora); and on the west by detached Districts belonging to Sindhia and Holkar. This portion of the State lies between lat. 23\u00b0 48' and 24\u00b0 48' N., and between long. 75\u00b0 55' and 77\u00b0 E., and contains the capital, Jhalra Patan. The second detached area is bounded on the north, east, and south by the Gwalior State, and on the west by Kotah. It lies between lat. 25\u00b0 5' and 25\u00b0 25' N., and between long. 76\u00b0 55' and 77\u00b0 25' E. The chief town in this tract is Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d. The third detached tract, known as Kirp\u00e1pur, situated to the north-west of the largest tract, is only a few square miles in extent, and is bounded on the north by Sindhia's territory, and on the east, south, and west by Mew\u00e1r (Udaipur). The area of the whole State is 2694 square miles; number of villages, 1455; towns, 2. Population (1881) 340,488.\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The main portion of Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r is situated on a raised plateau, gradually rising from 1000 feet above sea-level in the north to 1500 feet in the south. The northern, eastern, and part of the southern portions are very hilly, and intersected by many streams. The hills are for the most part covered with timber and grass, and sometimes enclose lakes, which have been formed by damming up the outlets of natural basins. The rest of this tract is a rich undulating plain, dotted with evergreen trees. The Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d tract is, on the west, an elevated table-land, well wooded; and in the eastern part, some 500 feet lower, very hilly and covered with thick jungle. Speaking generally, the soil is rich, of dark clayey mould, which produces valuable crops, such as opium, etc. Locally the soils are known and divided into 3 classes\u2014(1) k\u00e1li, the rich black loam; (2) m\u00e1l, a loam of a lighter colour, but almost equally fertile; (3) b\u00e1rl\u00ed, the shaly soil, by far the poorest of the three. It is estimated that about one-quarter of the cultivable area consists of k\u00e1li, one-half of m\u00e1l, and one-quarter of b\u00e1rl\u00ed soil. At places the presence of rock and kankar (calcareous limestone) close to the surface interferes with the productiveness of the k\u00e1li and m\u00e1l soils.\n\nOf the many streams running through the territory, the following are the most important:\u2014The Parwan enters the State at the south-east extremity, and winds for 50 miles up to the point where it enters Kotah; half-way, it is joined by the New\u00e1j, another good-sized stream. For 16 miles of its length, the Parwan forms the boundary line between Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r and Kotah State. There are two ferries on the Parwan; one at Manohar Th\u00e1n\u00e1, the other at Bhachurni. A ferry at Bhurilia crosses the New\u00e1j. The K\u00e1li Sind flows for a distance of about 30 miles through and along the border of the State. Its bed is rocky, the banks precipitous, and in parts lined with trees. There is a ferry at Bhonr\u00e1sa and another at Khair\u00e1si. The A\u00fa river, flowing from the south-western corner, traverses the State for a length of 60 miles, dividing Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r from Holkar's territory and the Tonk Districts in the south, and from Kotah in the north. It joins the K\u00e1li Sind at the point where that stream enters Kotah. The bed of this river is less rocky than the K\u00e1li Sind, its banks are steep, and in parts where the foliage reaches the water's edge, the views are picturesque. Ferries cross the A\u00fa at Suket and Bhilw\u00e1ri. The Chhota K\u00e1li Sind, with a ferry at Gangr\u00e1r, flows only for a short distance through the south-western portion of the State.\n\nThe following extract from a brief memorandum by the Superintendent of the Survey, shows the geological formation of the country:\u2014\n\n'Two of the main rock series of India are well exposed. Jhalra P\u00e1tan, the capital, stands on Vindhyan strata, at the northern edge of the great spread of basaltic rocks known as the Deccan trap formation, this\nnorthern area of it being also often mentioned as the M\u00e1lw\u00e1 trap. These Vindhyans belong to the upper division in the Geological Survey classification of this great Indian rock system. The beds about Jhalra T\u00e1tan are considered to belong to the Rew\u00e1 or middle group of them, and consist of sandstones and shales, with a band of limestone. Over the greater part of this Vindhyan area the strata are quite undisturbed, and their habit is to weather into scarped plateaux or ridges, having one face steep and the other sloping. These are capped by the sandstone, the low ground being eroded out of the shales. There are many varieties of basaltic rocks, hard with columnar and ball structure or amorphous, also vesicular and amygdaloidal in every degree, and soft crumbling ash-like beds, both earthy and vesicular. The age of the Vindhyan formation is quite unknown, beyond the fact that it must be at least as old as the palaeozoic. The trap is certainly either upper cretaceous or lower tertiary.' Iron, and red and yellow clays used for dyeing cloth, are found in the Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District.\n\nHistory.\u2014The ruling family of Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r belongs to the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1 clan of R\u00e1jputs. Their ancestors were petty chiefs of Halwad in the District of Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r, in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. About 1709 A.D., one Bhao Singh, a younger son of the head of the clan, set out from home with his son and a small troop of followers, to try his fortune at Delhi. At Kotah, Bhao Singh left his son M\u00e1dh\u00fa Singh with the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kotah, and went on himself to Delhi, where all trace of him ends. M\u00e1dh\u00fa Singh rose into great favour with the Kotah chief, who married his eldest son to M\u00e1dh\u00fa Singh's sister, and gave him a grant of the estate of Nandla, with the post of Faujd\u00e1r, which included not only the command of the troops, but that of the castle, the residence of the sovereign. This procured him the respectful title of M\u00e1ma, or maternal uncle, from the younger members of the prince's family, a title which habit has perpetuated with his successors. M\u00e1dh\u00fa Singh was succeeded in the office of Faujd\u00e1r by his son Madan Singh, and it then became hereditary in the family. Himmat Singh followed Madan Singh, and was in his turn succeeded by his famous nephew Zal\u00edm Singh, who was at the time only eighteen years of age. Three years later, Zal\u00edm Singh was the means of securing victory for the troops of Kotah over the army of Jaipur, but he afterwards fell into disfavour with the R\u00e1j\u00e1 in consequence of some rivalry in love. Being dismissed from his office, he migrated to Udaipur (Oodeypore), where he did good service. But when the Kotah R\u00e1j\u00e1 was on his death-bed, he sent for Zal\u00edm Singh, and committed his son Umed Singh and the country to his charge. From this time, Zal\u00edm Singh was the real ruler of Kotah. He raised it to a state of high prosperity; and under his administration, which lasted over forty-five years, the Kotah territory was respected by all parties\u2014Muhammadan, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1, and R\u00e1jput (see \u039a\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac). In 1838, it was\nresolved, with the consent of the chief of Kotah, to dismember the State, and to create the principality of Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r as a separate provision for the descendants of Zal\u00edm Singh, so that the State of Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r dates only from 1838. The Districts then severed from Kotah were considered to represent a revenue of 12 l\u0101khs of rupees (\u00a3120,000), or one-third of the income of the State. The new State also became responsible for one-third of the debts of Kotah; and by treaty acknowledged the supremacy of the British Government, agreeing to supply troops according to available means, and to pay an annual tribute of \u00a38000. Madan Singh received the title of Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1n\u00e1, was granted a salute of 15 guns, and placed on the same footing as the other chiefs in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. He was succeeded by Prithi Singh, who, during the Mutiny of 1857\u201358, did good service by conveying to places of safety several Europeans who had taken refuge in his State. He was succeeded in 1876 by his adopted son, Bakht Singh, then in his eleventh year. On accession, in accordance with family custom, which enjoins that only the four names of Zal\u00edm Singh, M\u00e1dhu Singh, Madan Singh, and Prithi Singh are to be assumed by the rulers of this house, he took the name of Zalim Singh. During his minority he was educated at the Mayo College in Ajmere, and the State was administered by a council under the superintendence of a British officer, whose headquarters are still at Jhalra P\u00e1tan. On 22nd February 1884, the R\u00e1n\u00e1 Zal\u00edm Singh was invested with governing powers, having attained his majority in November 1883. The chief of Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r is entitled to a salute of 15 guns. A military force is maintained of 20 field and 75 other guns, 247 artillerymen, 425 cavalry, and 3266 infantry.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014In Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r all the ordinary Indian grains are cultivated. In the southern Districts opium is extensively grown for the Bombay market. Throughout the rest of the State, wheat, jow\u00e1r, and opium are the chief crops, except in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, where the staple is b\u00e1jra (Holcus spicatus), and food-grasses locally known as r\u00e1l\u00ed and kodon. Irrigation is principally carried on by means of wells, water generally lying near the surface. Near Jhalra P\u00e1tan, however, is a large artificial lake, from which water is drawn by a channel two miles long. In 1882, it was estimated that about 434,740 acres, or less than one-third of the total area of the State, were cultivated. Of the untilled portion, more than one-third, but less than half, is cultivable; the remainder consisting of hilly and waste land.\n\nRevenue.\u2014The total revenue of the State in 1882\u201383 was \u00a3152,523, of which sum \u00a3118,397 was derived from the land. Of this sum only \u00a3132,480 reached the treasury, the balance, \u00a320,043, being alienated in j\u00e1girs or feudal holdings, or in religious grants. The theory that the State is lord of the soil is carried out in Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r. The cultivators,\nexcept in the Chaumela District (comprising the *pargan\u00e1s* of Pachpah\u00e1r, Awar, D\u00e1g, and Gangr\u00e1r), are, as a rule, occupancy tenants, holding directly from the State. In the Chaumela District, the revenue is realized from village communities, the members of which are called *wattand\u00e1rs*. But the bankers, who live in Jhalra P\u00e1tan, are the chief media for the transfer of revenue from the cultivators to the R\u00e1n\u00e1. The *j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1rs* furnish horses and men for the service of the State, and present themselves at head-quarters on the occurrence of festivals.\n\nThe police are distributed over four Districts and are under the charge of four superintendents. The numbers are 167 mounted and 1417 foot; and are included in the cavalry and infantry enumerated above. A central jail exists, in which the prisoners are employed in road-making and the manufacture of paper, rugs, and clothes. An extradition treaty was concluded with the State in 1868. Education is at present very backward, but is slowly progressing. There were in 1884 in the State 22 schools. In the Districts, the village priest teaches the young people (chiefly the sons of Br\u00e1hmans and Baniy\u00e1s) the method of keeping accounts and the rudiments of reading and writing Hind\u00ed. In the town of Jhalra P\u00e1tan, and in the Chhaoni or cantonment, there are two schools in which Hind\u00ed, Urd\u00fa, and English are taught; and one girls' school. The number of pupils receiving instruction in all the State schools (1883-84) was 1139, of whom 35 were girls. A judicial system has been introduced. The lower courts are *tahs\u00edl* courts with minor powers: above the *tahs\u00edl* courts are the appellate courts, generally formed of a *panch\u00e1yat*. Final appeal lies to the R\u00e1n\u00e1. Five dispensaries are maintained by the State, two at head-quarters, and three in the Districts; 162 in-door and 15,855 out-door patients were treated in 1883-84.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The population was estimated in 1875 at 226,000 persons; by the Census of 1881, it was returned at 340,488, namely, 183,039 males and 157,449 females, dwelling in 63,001 houses. Number of persons per square mile, 126\u00b738; houses per square mile, 23\u00b775; persons per house, 5\u00b74. Of the total population, 319,612, or 93 per cent., were returned as Hindus; 20,863 Muhammadans; and 13 Christians. Among the Hindus, 18,498 were Br\u00e1hmans; 9491 R\u00e1jputs, of the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1 and Rahtor clans for the most part, and 291,623 other Hindu castes, the principal being Baniy\u00e1s or Mah\u00e1jans (13,470), G\u00fajars (18,591), M\u00ednas (16,084), Bhils (16,459), Cham\u00e1rs (27,313), Dhakurs (11,263), Sondhi\u00e1s (36,026), Balais (17,787), Kachh\u00eds (1077), J\u00e1ts (1409), and other Hindus (132,144). The different sects among the Muhammadans were returned as follows:\u2014Shaikhs, 5593; Sayyids, 1104; Mughals, 553; Path\u00e1ns, 6878; other Muhammadans, 6735. The Sondhi\u00e1s or Sondh\u00eds\nare found to the number of about thirty-six thousand in the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r State. The complexion of this race is fair, neither very dark nor very light (Sandhia = twilight). They claim descent from a prince born with the face of a tiger, and consider themselves a distinct R\u00e1jput people. They are idle, predatory, and immoral. Their women have a reputation for horsemanship.\n\nMeans of Communication.\u2014There are in the State $51\\frac{1}{2}$ miles of metalled road and $89\\frac{1}{2}$ miles of fair-weather road; of the former, a length of $27\\frac{1}{2}$ miles is on the road running through the State from Kotah on the northern border, to Raipur in Holkar\u2019s territory on the southern; the remaining length of 24 miles being in and around the cantonments and town of Jhalra P\u00e1tan. All other roads are simply cart tracks, which in the rains become useless for wheeled traffic. The principal of these lead towards the high-road between Agra and Bombay, towards Agra and Indore, to the south-west towards Ujjain, to the west in the direction of Nimach (Neemuch). Along the south-east and south routes traffic is carried on with Bombay through Indore, opium being exported, and English cloths imported; grain from Bhop\u00e1l is also imported by these routes. By the north-west route grain from Har\u00e1oti, and a small quantity of cloth from Agra, is imported. The chief towns in the State are Jhalra P\u00e1tan, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, Kailw\u00e1ra, Chhipa Burod, Bukari Suket, Mandh\u00e1r Th\u00e1n\u00e1, Pachpah\u00e1r, D\u00e1g, and Gangr\u00e1r.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate of Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r resembles that of Central India, and is generally healthy. The hot weather is less severe than in Northern R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, the thermometer during the day in the shade ranging from $85\u00b0$ to $88\u00b0$ F. The temperature during the rains is cool and pleasant, and in the cold weather frosts occasionally occur. No trustworthy register of the rainfall has been kept; but judging from the record kept at Agar (a station in Sindhia\u2019s territory, about 60 miles south of Jhalra P\u00e1tan), the annual rainfall is probably between 30 and 40 inches. In 1883, the rainfall was registered at four stations, viz. the cantonments $30\\cdot5$, Jhalra P\u00e1tan $33\\cdot6$, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d $33\\cdot5$, and Aklera $38\\cdot7$ inches.\n\nJh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r.\u2014Division or Pranth of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency. Takes its name from the Jh\u00e1la R\u00e1jputs, who own the principal estates. It includes the States of Dhr\u00e1ngadra, the chief of which is the recognised head of the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1 clan, Wank\u00e1ner, Limbd\u00ed, Wadhw\u00e1n, and minor States. Area, about 4400 square miles. Population (1872) $427,329$; (1881) $439,629$, namely, $228,701$ males and $210,928$ females, dwelling in 9 towns and 702 villages, and occupying 94,548 houses. Average density of population, $102\\cdot4$ per square mile. According to religion, Hindus numbered $371,510$; Muhammadans, $37,156$; and \u2018others,\u2019 $30,963$.\nJhalera.\u2014Guaranteed Gir\u00e1sia, Th\u00e1kurate, or chiefship, under the Bhop\u00e1l Agency, Central India. The chief receives from Sindhia a pecuniary allowance, in lieu of rights over land, of nearly \u00a3120. This is paid through the Political Agent, to whom also the Th\u00e1kur is subordinate in his administration.\n\nJh\u00e1lod.\u2014Petty division of the Sub-division of Dahod, Panch Mah\u00e1ls District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. $22^\\circ 25' 50''$ to $23^\\circ 35' N.$, and long. $74^\\circ 6'$ to $74^\\circ 23' 25'' E.$ Jh\u00e1lod is bounded on the north by Chelk\u00e1ri State, on the east by Kushalgad State, both in Central India, on the south by the southern portion of Dohad Sub-division, and on the west by Baria (Bariya) and Sunth of Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha. The Anas river runs along its eastern face. Water is in most places close to the surface, and large areas are watered by lever-lifts from unbuilt wells. The important trade route from Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t) to M\u00e1lw\u00e1 passes through the tract. Area, 267 square miles. Population (1872) 36,785. The Census of 1881 does not show the population of Jh\u00e1lod separately, but includes it with that of the Sub-division of which it forms a part.\n\nJh\u00e1lod.\u2014Town in Jh\u00e1lod, petty division of the Sub-division of Dahod, Panch Mah\u00e1ls District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. $23^\\circ 7' N.$, long. $74^\\circ 10' E.$ Population (1881) 5579, of whom 2659 were Hindus, 1061 Muhammadans, 69 Jains, and \u2018others,\u2019 1790. Area of town site, 94 acres. The inhabitants are mostly Bh\u00edls and Kol\u00eds. There is an export trade in grain, pottery, cotton cloth, and lac bracelets in imitation of the costly ivory Ratl\u00e1m bracelets. There is a large pond near the town.\n\nJhalotar-Ajg\u00e1in.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of Moh\u00e1n tahsil, Unao District, Oudh; situated between Moh\u00e1n Aur\u00e1s on the north, and Harha on the south. Originally constituted a pargan\u00e1 in the reign of Akbar. Area, 98 square miles, of which 55 are cultivated; Government land revenue demand, \u00a38901; average incidence, 2s. 10\u00bdd. per acre. The prevailing tenure is imperfect pattid\u00e1ri, 46,650 out of the total of 62,657 acres being thus held; of the balance, 12,096 acres are zamin-d\u00e1ri, and 3910 t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri. Population (1881) 58,185, namely, 30,536 males and 27,649 females. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway intersects the pargan\u00e1, with a station at Kusumbhi. Five mark\u00e9t villages.\n\nJhalra P\u00e1tan (or P\u00e1tan).\u2014Chief town of the Native State of Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Jhalra P\u00e1tan lies in lat. $24^\\circ 32' N.$, and long. $76^\\circ 12' E.$; situated at the foot of a low range of hills running from southeast to north-west. The drainage from these hills to the north-west of the town is collected into a good-sized lake by a large and very solid masonry dam, about two-thirds of a mile long, on which stand sundry temples and buildings. The town lies behind this dam, the general level of\nthe ground being the same height as the water of the lake in the cold weather. Between the city walls and the foot of the hills stretch a number of gardens, watered by a small canal brought from the lake. Except on the lake side, the city is protected by a masonry wall with circular bastions and a ditch capable of being supplied by the lake. This ditch, however, ceases in the centre of the eastern face. From the west, running south of the city at a distance of 400 or 500 yards, flows the Chandrab\u00e1gha river, which then bends to the north-east, and, passing through the hills, joins the K\u00e1l\u00ed Sind after a course of about four miles through open country. On a hill 150 feet above the city is situated a small square fort of no importance.\n\nThe old town was situated a little to the south of the present site, on the bank of the Chandrab\u00e1gha. There is considerable diversity of opinion as to the derivation of the name. According to Tod, Jhalra P\u00e1tan means the \u2018City of Bells,\u2019 as the old town, being a place of some sanctity, contained 108 temples with bells. It was also known from its position by the name of Chandioti-Nagri, which was destroyed, and its temple despoiled in the time of Aurangzeb. All that was left of the ancient place in 1796, was the temple of S\u00e1t Seheli, or \u2018Seven Damsels,\u2019 which still stands in the new town. Others connect the name of the town with the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1 clan. Thornton considers the most plausible etymology to be jhalra, \u2018a spring of water,\u2019 and p\u00e1tan, a \u2018town.\u2019\n\nThe present city was founded in 1796 by Zal\u00edm Singh, who also established the Chhaoni, a permanent cantonment about 4 miles north from the city, with which it is connected by a metalled road. Zal\u00edm Singh, upon founding Jhalra P\u00e1tan, placed a large stone tablet in the centre of the town, on which was engraved a promise that new settlers would be excused the payment of custom dues, and would be, for whatever crime convicted, fined no more than Rs. 1-4 (2s. 6d.). This edict was annulled in 1850. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1n\u00e1\u2019s palace and all the courts and public offices are situated in the Chhaoni or cantonment. The palace is enclosed by a high masonry wall forming a square, with large circular bastions at each corner, and two semi-circular ones in the centre of each face or side of the square; the length of each face being 735 feet. The principal entrance is in the centre of the eastern side, and the approach to it is along the main street of the b\u00e1z\u00e1r running due east and west. About a mile to the south-west is a sheet of water, below which, and watered by it, are several gardens, in the centre of one of which is a bungalow, with a canal round it filled with water from the lake. The Chhaoni is situated on a rising stretch of rocky ground, about 2\u00bd miles from the strong fort of Gagraun, in Kotah territory. Its present great want is a proper water-supply for drinking and bathing purposes. The population is\nlarger than that of the town proper. The chief bankers live at Jhalra P\u00e1tan. The mint and other State establishments are there also. It is the head-quarters of the Jhalra P\u00e1tan pargan\u00e1, while the cantonment is the head-quarters of the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r court. Population (1881) of P\u00e1tan, 11,469, namely, 6042 males and 5427 females. Hindus were returned as numbering 9378 and Muhammadans 2091. Of Chhaoni the population was 20,303, namely, 10,866 males and 9437 females. Hindus numbered 14,212; Muhammadans, 6080; and 'others,' 11.\n\nJhalu.\u2014Town in Bijnaur tahsil, Bijnor (Bijnaur) District, North-Western Provinces. Situated in lat. 29\u00b0 20' 10\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 15' 30\" E., on the Dh\u00e1mpur road, 6 miles east of Bijnaur town. Population (1872) 5979; (1881) 5547, namely, Hindus, 3102; and Muhammadans, 2445. Area of town site, 94 acres. An important market town, with a large trade in agricultural produce. For police and conservancy purposes, a house-tax is levied.\n\nJh\u00e1mka.\u2014Petty State in South K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Gujer\u00e1t (Guz\u00e9r\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency. Jh\u00e1mka consists of 1 village, Jh\u00e1mka, with 2 separate tribute-payers. It is 10 miles south of Kunk\u00e1v\u00e1r station on the Dhor\u00e1ji branch line of the Bhaunagar-Gond\u00e1l Railway, and 18 miles north-west of L\u00e1kh\u00e1p\u00e1dar th\u00e1nd\u00e1. The revenue in 1881 was estimated at \u00a3400; tribute of \u00a318, 10s. is paid to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda. Population (1881) 785.\n\nJhammar.\u2014Petty State in Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r Division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Guzer\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency. Jhammar consists of 1 village, Jhammar; with 2 separate tribute-payers. It is 9 miles north-east of Wadh\u00e1n city, and 3 miles south-west of Lakhtar station on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway. The t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs are Jh\u00e1l\u00e1 R\u00e1jputs and Bh\u00e1y\u00e1ds of Wadh\u00e1n. The revenue in 1881 was estimated at \u00a3401; tribute of \u00a346, 8s. is paid to the British Government. Population (1872) 584; (1881) 717.\n\nJh\u00e1mpodar.\u2014Petty State in Jh\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r Division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Gujer\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency. Jh\u00e1mpodar consists of 1 village, Jh\u00e1mpodar, with 3 separate tribute-payers. It is 10 miles south of Lakhtar, and 10 miles east of Wadh\u00e1n station on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway. The t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs are Jh\u00e1l\u00e1 R\u00e1jputs, Bh\u00e1y\u00e1ds of Wadh\u00e1n. The revenue in 1881 was estimated at \u00a3412; tribute of \u00a313, 16s. is paid to the British Government. Population (1872) 449; (1881) 561.\n\nJhang.\u2014British District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between 30\u00b0 35' and 32\u00b0 4' N. lat., and between 71\u00b0 39' and 73\u00b0 38' E. long. Jhang forms the northern District of the Mult\u00e1n (Mooltan) Division. It stands fourth in order of area, and twenty-sixth in order of population, among the thirty-two Districts of the Province, comprising 5'33 per cent. of the total area, 2'10 per\ncent. of the total population, and 1\u00b752 per cent. of the urban population of British territory. The District is bounded on the north by Sh\u00e1hpur and Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la; on the west by Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n; and on the southeast by Montgomery, Mult\u00e1n, and Muza\u0444\u0444argarh. Area, 5702 square miles; population (1881), 395,296 souls. The administrative headquarters are at Maghiana, a suburb of the town of Jhang.\n\nPhysical Aspects. \u2014 The District of Jhang comprises an irregular triangle, artificially constituted for administrative purposes from portions of three separate tracts. Its eastern half embraces a large part of the high dorsal ridge in the Rechna Do\u00e1b; thence it stretches across the Chen\u00e1b into the wedge of land between that stream and the Jehlam (Jhelum), whose waters unite a few miles below the town of Jhang; while westward again the boundary runs beyond the joint river, far into the heart of the Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) Do\u00e1b. The R\u00e1vi also bounds the District for a few miles along its southern edge. So artificial a tract can hardly be said to possess any common natural features of its own. Starting from the eastern border, we come first upon the b\u00e1r or wild upland plain of the Rechna Do\u00e1b, broken here and there by sandy depressions, and inhabited only by pastoral nomads, who dwell in moveable hamlets of thatched huts. In the south, however, along the bank of the R\u00e1vi, and to the west, along the Chen\u00e1b, before and after its junction with the Jehlam, strips of comparatively fertile lowland support a dense population. Some seven miles east of the Chen\u00e1b, the country once more rises, and abruptly changes from a wooded cultivable plain to the lifeless wilderness characteristic of the higher lands between the river valleys of the western Punjab. Strips of cultivation along the convergent streams enclose this sterile wedge, which runs like an intrusive spur of Sh\u00e1hpur District down the centre of the Jech Do\u00e1b. Beyond the Jehlam, another singularly fertile belt fringes the river, extending a few miles inland, till it reaches the bank of the Sind S\u00e1g\u00e1r thal, rising like a wall above the rich alluvial lowland. Only 39 per cent. of the whole area is included within regularly defined villages; the remainder consists of wild and elevated plateaux, almost destitute of vegetation, or covered with clumps of coarse grass. An ancient watercourse, now dry, crosses the north-eastern angle, and bears the name of the Nann\u00e1nwa Canal.\n\nThere are no mines in the District, but there are several stone quarries in the hills near Chiniot, where mill-stones, pestles and mortars, shoemakers' blocks, kneading stones, oil-pans for lamps, etc., are made. The Kir\u00e1na Hills are said to contain iron-ore, but it has never been worked. Fish are caught at Lalera, in the extreme south, to supply the market of Mult\u00e1n. Beasts of prey include the wolf, hy\u00e6na, wild cat, and lynx. Ravine-deer, wild hog, and hares occur in the less frequented parts of the lowlands; geese are plentiful during the season,\nbut wild duck are scarce. A few wild asses are said to roam over the outskirts of the desert uplands. The sajji plant, which yields soda, grows abundantly in the high ground between the Chen\u00e1b and the Jehlam, and in the southern part of the Rechn\u00e1 Do\u00e1b.\n\nHistory.\u2014The District of Jhang possesses unusual historical interest, from the presence within its borders of the ruins which crown the small rocky eminence of S\u00e1nglaw\u00e1la Tiba. This site has been identified by General Cunningham with the S\u00e1kala of the Br\u00e1hmans, the S\u00e1gal of Buddhism, and the Sangala of Alexander's historians. The hill occupies a position on the Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la border, surrounded on two sides by a large swamp, formerly a lake of considerable depth. In the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, S\u00e1kala appears as the capital of the M\u00e1dras, whose memory still survives in the name of M\u00e1dra-des, which the surrounding country retains at the present day. Paths through the primeval forest then led up to the lake and hill where the Aryan colonists had placed their stronghold. In Buddhist legend, S\u00e1gal appears as the metropolis of King Kusa, against whom seven kings made war, to carry off his wife, Prabh\u00e1vati; but the king, mounting an elephant, met them without the city, and shouted with so loud a voice that his cry resounded over all the earth, and the seven kings fled away in terror. The Greek historians inform us how Alexander turned aside from his projected march towards the Ganges, to attack the people of Sangala, who held out against him in the rear. He found the city strong both by art and nature, defended by brick walls and covered on two approaches by the lake. The Macedonian forces attacked and took an outpost on the low ridge of Mundapapura, after which they laid siege to the city, undermined the walls, and carried the position by assault. Hwen Thsang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, who visited S\u00e1kala in 630 A.D., has given the topographical details which enable General Cunningham to effect the present identification with an unusual degree of certainty. The walls then lay in ruins, and a small inhabited town occupied the centre of the ancient city, whose relics surrounded it on every side. It still contained a Buddhist monastery of 100 monks, and two topes (st\u00fapas), one of them erected by the famous Emperor Asoka. Sherkot, in the lowlands of the Chen\u00e1b, has also been identified, though less certainly, with a town of the Malli, attacked and taken by Alexander, and described at a later period by Hwen Thsang as the capital of a considerable District.\n\nIn modern times, the history of Jhang centres in the family of Si\u00e1ls, who ruled over a large tract between Sh\u00e1hpur and Mult\u00e1n, with little dependence on the imperial court at Delhi, until they finally fell before the power of Ranj\u00edt Singh. The Si\u00e1ls of Jhang are Muhammadans of R\u00e1jput descent, whose ancestor, R\u00e1i Shankar of D\u00e1r\u00e1nagar, emigrated\nearly in the 13th century from the Gangetic Do\u00e1b to Jaunpur. His son, Si\u00e1l, in 1243, left his adopted city for the Punjab, then overrun by the Mughal hordes. Such emigrations appear to have occurred frequently at the time, owing to the unsettled state of the lower Provinces. During his wanderings in search of a home, Si\u00e1l fell in with the famous Musalm\u00e1n saint B\u00e1ba Far\u00edd-ud-d\u00edn Shakarganj of P\u00e1k-pattan, whose eloquence converted him to the faith of Isl\u00e1m. He afterwards sojourned for a while at Si\u00e1lkot, where he built a fort; but finally settled down and married at S\u00e1hiw\u00e1l, in Sh\u00e1hpur District. It must be confessed, however, that his life and those of his descendants bear somewhat the character of eponymic myths. M\u00e1nak, sixth in descent from Si\u00e1l, founded the town of Mankera in 1380; and his great-grandson, Mal Kh\u00e1n, built Jh\u00e1ng Si\u00e1l on the Chen\u00e1b in 1462. Four years later, Mal Kh\u00e1n presented himself at Lahore, in obedience to a summons, and obtained the territory of Jhang as a hereditary possession, subject to a payment of tribute into the imperial treasury. His family continued to rule at Jhang, with the usual dynastic quarrels and massacres of Indian annals, till the beginning of the present century.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sikh power had arisen in the north, and Karam Singh D\u00fal\u00fa, a chief of the Bhangi confederacy, had conquered Chiniot in this District. In 1803, Ranjit Singh marched against that fort and captured it, after which he turned towards Jhang, but was bought off by Ahmad Kh\u00e1n, the last of the Si\u00e1l chieftains, on promise of a yearly tribute, amounting to \u00a37000 and a mare. Three years later, however, the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 again invaded Jhang with a large army, and captured the fort, after a desperate resistance. Ahmad Kh\u00e1n then fled to Mult\u00e1n, and the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 farmed the territories of Jhang to Sard\u00e1r Fateh Singh. Shortly afterwards, Ahmad Kh\u00e1n returned with a force given him by Muzaffar Kh\u00e1n, Naw\u00e1b of Mult\u00e1n, and recovered a large part of his previous dominions, which Ranjit Singh suffered him to retain on payment of the former tribute; as he found himself too busy elsewhere to attack Jhang. After his successful attempt on Mult\u00e1n in 1810, the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 took Ahmad Kh\u00e1n a prisoner to Lahore, as he suspected him of favouring his enemy, Muzaffar Kh\u00e1n. He afterwards bestowed on him a j\u00e1g\u00edr, which descended to his son, In\u00e1yat Kh\u00e1n. On the death of the latter, his brother, Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, endeavoured to obtain succession to the j\u00e1g\u00edr, but failed through the opposition of Gulk\u00e1b Singh. In 1847, after the establishment of the British Agency at Lahore, the District came under the charge of our Government; and in 1848, Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n rendered important services against the rebel chiefs, for which he received a small pension. During the Mutiny of 1857, the Si\u00e1l leader again proved his loyalty by raising a force of cavalry and serving in person on the British side.\nHis pension was afterwards increased, and he obtained the title of Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur, with a small j\u00e1g\u00edr for life.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The Census of 1855 returned the total population of the District, as then constituted, at 251,769 persons; but by adding the population of various villages in Sh\u00e1hpur and Muzaffargarh, since transferred to Jhang, the total is raised to 299,054. In 1868, the next enumeration disclosed a total population, over an area corresponding to the present District, of 347,043, or an increase of 47,989 over 1855. At the last Census in 1881, it was ascertained that the population had increased to 395,296, or by 96,242 since 1855, or by 48,253 since 1868. The results of the Census of 1881 may be briefly summarized as follows:\u2014Area, 5702 square miles, with 5 towns and 756 villages; number of houses, 87,808, of which 67,024 were occupied and 20,784 unoccupied. Number of families, 85,064. Total population, 395,296, namely, males 214,382, and females 180,914. Average density of population, 69 per square mile; towns or villages per square mile, 0\u00b713; persons per town or village, 520; houses per square mile, 15; persons per occupied house, 5\u00b79. Classified according to age, there were, under 15 years of age\u2014males 90,862, and females 78,463; above 15 years\u2014males 123,520, and females 102,451. As regards religious distinctions, the District forms a strong centre for the faith of Isl\u00e1m. The Muhammadans at the date of the Census numbered 326,910, or 82\u00b770 per cent.; while the Hindus amounted to only 64,892, or 16\u00b742 per cent. The Sikhs were returned at 3477; Christians, 11; Jains, 4; and P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 2. In the ethnical classification, R\u00e1jputs occupy the first place numerically, with 89,641 persons, chiefly Si\u00e1ls and Bhatt\u00eds. J\u00e1ts come next with 48,242. Aroras, a Hindu trading caste, numbered 45,041; Khatr\u00e9s, 15,196; Julah\u00e1s, 24,176; Biluch\u00eds, 15,093; Sayyids, 5944; and Br\u00e1hmans, 5319.\n\nOnly 3 towns contained a population exceeding 5000 persons\u2014namely, Maghiana, 12,574, and Jhang, 9055, the two places forming practically one town; and Chiniot, 10,731. The only other places worthy of the name of towns are Shorkot, 2283; and Ahmadpur, 2388. Of the 761 towns and villages (or rather in many cases collections of houses grouped together for Census purposes), 550 were returned as containing less than five hundred inhabitants; 141 from five hundred to a thousand; 52 from one to two thousand; 12 from two to three thousand; and 6 towns upwards of three thousand inhabitants. It is only in the Chiniot tahs\u00edl, and in the better cultivated tracts in other portions of the District, that all the inhabitants of the lands included in a village site occupy one compact hamlet or village, in the English sense of the word. They prefer dwelling in isolated homesteads, at their separate wells. In the south of the District there are many village areas which have no village site what-\never, each proprietor living at his well. The well of the lambard\u00e1r or head-man, and perhaps one other of the village proprietors, may have a small hamlet growing up round it, consisting of the huts of the proprietor and his tenants, and of a shopkeeper and a few village menials (k\u00e1mins); but there are hardly any strong, solidly-built villages, such as are seen in Districts farther east. As regards occupation, the Census returned the male population above 15 years of age under the following heads:\u2014(1) professional class, 3646; (2) domestic and menial class, 2935; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, and carriers, 4711; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, 59,343; (5) industrial and manufacturing class, including artisans, 34,251; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, 12,540; (7) occupation not specified, 6094. Punj\u00e1b\u00ed and J\u00e1t\u00ed (Mult\u00e1n\u00ed) are the languages spoken in the District.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The area under cultivation in 1873 amounted to 241,325 acres, and in 1881-82 to 322,788 acres, or, roughly speaking, one-tenth of the entire area. The distinguishing feature of the District consists in the fact that no crops can anywhere be grown without irrigation. The best land is that which lies beyond the immediate action of the rivers, and between the alluvial lands and the high bank of the b\u00e1r. In this tract all the principal staples of the District can be raised by means of well-irrigation. The land exposed to the inundations produces more uncertain crops, as a rich deposit sometimes covers the previously sterile plain, while at other times villages, wells, and cultivated fields are carried away by the destructive flood. Rain crops are practically unknown. Wheat, barley, gram, turnips, and peas form the staples of the spring harvest; while jo\u00e1r, cotton, mash, ch\u00edn\u00e1, t\u00e1l, and maize make up the chief items of the autumn crops. In 1881-82, wheat covered 172,760 acres; jo\u00e1r, 38,561 acres; gram, 13,208 acres; barley, 6240 acres; cotton, 29,781 acres; and vegetables, 17,322. Agricultural knowledge remains in a backward state, rotation of crops being absolutely unknown, and perhaps unneeded. Manure is largely used, and fallows are made use of to reinvigorate exhausted land.\n\nCattle-grazing forms the means of livelihood of a large section of population, and nearly one-half of the total assessed area of the District, or 1,520,383 acres, is returned as grazing land. Cattle theft forms a common crime in the District. Horse and camel breeding is a favourite pursuit. The horses of Jhang bear a high reputation, and the mares are esteemed among the best in the Punjab.\n\nThe village system and the theory of joint responsibility for the land revenue may be regarded as entirely an innovation of British rule. By far the greater number of villages are held on the tenure known as bh\u00e1y\u00e1ch\u00e1ra ch\u00e1hw\u00e1r, though they cannot be\nentirely assimilated to any of the common Punjab types. The majority of tenants hold their land at will. Of the total area held by tenants, only one per cent. is cultivated by tenants paying cash rents, the general rate in kind being half produce. Money rents where they occur vary from 6s. to \u00a34, 10s. per acre. Good irrigated wheat lands bring in \u00a31, 8s., cotton lands from 12s. to \u00a31, 7s. Prices of food-grains ruled as follows on the 1st January 1883:\u2014Wheat, 20 sers per rupee, or 5s. 7d. per cwt.; flour, 17 sers per rupee, or 6s. 7d. per cwt.; barley, 40 sers per rupee, or 2s. 10d. per cwt.; gram, 29 sers per rupee, or 3s. 10d. per cwt.; maize, 45 sers per rupee, or 2s. 6d. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 34 sers per rupee, or 3s. 4d. per cwt.; bajra, 29 sers per rupee, or 3s. 10d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The commerce of the District is inconsiderable, and most of the trade is local. Grain is imported from the banks of the R\u00e1vi and from Wazir\u00e1b\u00e1d in Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la. Country cloth is manufactured at Jhang and Maghi\u00e1na, and bought up by the Povindah merchants of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n. The District contains as many as 8,144 looms, and the annual value of the cloth woven amounts to about \u00a3100,000. The estimated value of the imports is returned at \u00a3285,227, and that of the exports \u00a394,889. Manufactures of leather and of gold and silver lace also exist. The chief roads are those from Mult\u00e1n to Wazir\u00e1b\u00e1d, passing Sherkot, Jhang, Maghi\u00e1na, and Chiniot in this District; and from Chichawatni in Montgomery District on the Lahore and Mult\u00e1n line of railway to Ch\u00e1h Bhareri leading to Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n. A mail cart runs between Chichawatni, Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, and Bannu. Total length of roads, 954 miles. The Lahore-Mult\u00e1n branch of the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway passes near the south of the District, but nowhere intersects it. A bridge of boats has been constructed across the united waters of the Jehlam and Chen\u00e1b, just below their junction. Both rivers are navigable all the year round by the largest native craft. They are crossed at various points by 28 ferries. Length of navigable rivers, 166 miles within the District.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total imperial revenue raised in the District in 1873 amounted to \u00a349,302, of which sum the land-tax contributed \u00a342,115, or more than six-sevenths. In 1881\u201382, the imperial revenue had increased to \u00a354,136, of which \u00a344,449 was derived from the land. Stamps form the only other item of revenue of any importance. In addition to the imperial revenue, a Provincial and a local revenue are also raised, the estimated income from both being \u00a312,000. Leases for grazing and for collecting sajj\u00ed form considerable items of public income. The administrative staff usually comprises a Deputy Commissioner and two extra-Assistant Commissioners, besides the usual judicial, fiscal, and constabulary officers. In\n1882, the regular police force consisted of a total of 396 officers and men, or, with the municipal and ferry police, 475; being at the rate of 1 policeman to every 12 square miles of area, and every 832 of the population. The total number of persons brought to trial for all offences committed in the District during the year 1882 amounted to 2543, of whom 1493 were convicted. The District jail at Maghi\u00e1n\u00e1 contained in 1881\u201382 a total population of 970 prisoners, with a daily average of 307 inmates. Education was carried on during 1882 by 53 Government-inspected schools, attended by 2156 pupils. Inquiries by the Education Department ascertained the existence also of a total of 314 indigenous schools at which 2863 children were obtaining some form of education. For fiscal and administrative purposes, the District is divided into 3 tahsils and 25 police circles. The four municipal towns of Jhang-Maghi\u00e1n\u00e1, Chiniot, Shorkot, and Ahmadpur had a total revenue in 1881\u201382 of \u00a33551, or an average of 1s. 10d. per head of the population (37,213) within municipal limits.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The District bears a good reputation for healthiness. Small-pox and fever are the most prevalent diseases. The total number of deaths recorded from all causes in 1881 amounted to 6479, or 18 per thousand of the population. Of these, 2033, or 10\u00b791 per thousand, were assigned to fever alone. Government charitable dispensaries have been established at Maghi\u00e1n\u00e1, Jhang, Shorkot, Chiniot, Ahmadpur, and Kot Is\u00e1 Sh\u00e1h. In 1881 they afforded relief to 67,835 persons, of whom 1359 were in-patients. The average annual rainfall for the 20 years ending 1881 is returned by the Meteorological Department at 11\u00b718 inches. The rainfall in the latter year was 8\u00b740 inches, or 2\u00b778 inches below the average. [For further information concerning Jhang, see the Gazetteer of the District, published by authority of the Punjab Government (1883\u201384). Also the Punjab Census Report for 1881, and the various annual Administrative and Departmental Provincial Reports from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nJhang.\u2014Central tahsil of Jhang District, Punjab, comprising an irregular tract on either side of the river Chen\u00e1b. Lat. 30\u00b0 35\u2032 to 31\u00b0 36\u2032 N., and long. 71\u00b0 39\u2032 to 72\u00b0 39\u2032 E. Area, 2347 square miles. Population (1881) 171,713, namely, males 92,792, and females 78,921. Average density of population, 73 per square mile. Muhammadans numbered 137,121; Hindus, 32,168; Sikhs, 2417; and \u2018others,\u2019 7. Of a total assessed area in 1878\u201379, according to the last quinquennial agricultural statistics published by the Punjab Government, 167,834 acres were returned as under cultivation, of which more than one-half, or 89,038 acres, were irrigated, entirely by private enterprise. Of the remainder, 682,700 were returned as grazing lands, 322,186 acres as cultivable but not under cultivation, and 382,446 acres as uncultivable waste. The average annual area under the principal crops for the five\nyears from 1877-78 to 1881-82 is returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 70,109 acres; jo\u00e1r, 16,171 acres; gram, 4164 acres; cotton, 13,172 acres; and vegetables, 3576 acres. Revenue of the tahs\u00edl, \u00a319,660. The subdivisional establishment, including the head-quarters staff, comprised in 1883 a Deputy Commissioner, two Assistant Commissioners, a tahsil\u00e1dar, and a munsif. These officers preside over 5 civil and 4 criminal courts; number of police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 6; strength of regular police, 140 men; village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 227.\n\nJhang.\u2014Town and municipality in Jhang District, Punjab. Lat. 31\u00b0 16' 16\" N., long. 72\u00b0 21' 45\" E. Population (1881) 9055, namely, 4270 Hindus, 4636 Muhammadans, 143 Sikhs, and 6 'others.' The sister town of Maghiana, containing the civil station for the District, lies 2 miles south of Jhang, and has a population of 12,574 persons, giving a grand total for both of 21,629. They form together a single municipality, and may be regarded as practically one town; situated about 3 miles to the east of the present bed of the Chen\u00e1b, 10 and 13 miles respectively north-west of its junction with the Jehlam. Jhang itself lies on the lowland, a little apart from the regular lines of trade; and since the removal of the Government offices to Maghi\u00e1na, it has yielded its commerce and importance to its younger rival. The town is traversed by a single main street, running east and west, lined on either side with masonry shops built on a uniform plan. All the streets and lanes are paved with brick, and well drained. Outside the town are the school buildings with a pretty fountain, the dispensary, and police buildings. The old town of Jhang was founded by Mal Kh\u00e1n, a Si\u00e1l chieftain, in 1462, and was for long the capital of a Muhammadan State. It was situated south-west of the modern town, and has been long since swept away by encroachments of the river, although some traces of it are still discernible. The present town was founded at the beginning of the 17th century, in the reign of the Emperor Aurangzeb, by one L\u00e1l N\u00e1th, the ancestor of the present 'Nath Sahib' of Jhang. On one side the approach to the town is almost barred by unsightly sandhills, but on the other it affords a tolerably picturesque appearance from numerous groves and gardens. (See Jhang District.) Principal inhabitants, Si\u00e1ls and Khatr\u00eds. Manufacture of country cloth, bought up by the Povindah merchants of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n.

Among high-caste Hindus, Br\u0101hmans numbered 111,034; R\u0101jputs, 72,131; and K\u0101yasths, 17,819. The most numerous caste in the Division are the despised Cham\u0101rs, 134,398, the other important castes according to numerical superiority being\u2014Kachh\u012bs, 82,612; Lodh\u012bs, 63,493; Ah\u012brs, 61,470; Kor\u012bs, 44,280; Kurm\u012bs, 37,651; Baniy\u0101s, 29,231; Gadari\u0101s, 25,725; Tel\u012bs, 24,286; and Na\u012bs, 22,892.\n\nTotal adult male cultivators and agricultural labourers, 211,730, cultivating an average of 6\u00bd acres each. The total population, however, dependent on the soil was 607,354, or 60.70 per cent. of the Divisional population. The total adult male and female agriculturists numbered 340,379, of whom 32,011 were returned as landholders, 951 as estate agents, 299,006 as cultivators, and 78,311 as agricultural labourers. Total cultivated area, 2148.8 square miles; of these, 1997.2 square miles are assessed for Government revenue, which in 1881 amounted (including local rates and cesses paid on the land) to \u00a3178,612, or an average of 2s. 9d. per cultivated acre. Total rental paid by the cultivators, \u00a3354,428, or an average of 5s. 17\u00bdd. per cultivated acre.

Jhansi forms the central District in the Division of the same name. It is bounded on the north by the Gwalior and Samth\u0101r States, and by Jalau\u1e47 District; on the east by the river Dhas\u0101n, which separates it from Ham\u012brpur District; on the south by the District of L\u0101litpur and the Orchha State; and on the west by the Datiy\u0101, Gwalior, and Khania-\ndh\u00e1n\u00e1 States. The District is much intersected by the surrounding Native States. On the north, the States of Gwalior, Datiy\u00e1, and Samth\u00e1r; and towards the south and east, the Orchha State, and the Hasht-bh\u00e1ya j\u00e1girs of Tori Fatehpur, Bijna, Pah\u00e1ri-Banka, and Dhurw\u00e1i, encroach on Jh\u00e1nsi, or are interlaced with it. Single villages or groups of two or three villages belonging to one or other of these States are scattered like islands throughout the District. In like manner, several small patches of British territory are isolated from the rest of the District, and completely surrounded by native territory. This intermixture of alien villages has been productive of great administrative difficulties, especially in years of famine. Area, 1567 square miles; population (1881) 333,227 souls. The administrative head-quarters are at the village of Jhansi Naoabad, close to the native town of Jhansi, now belonging to Gwalior; but the most populous town in the District is Mau (Mhow).\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Jh\u00e1nsi forms a portion of the hill country of Bundelkhand, sloping down southward from the outliers of the Vindhyan range to the tributaries of the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1) on the north. The south of the District is composed of long and narrow ridged hills which run parallel with one another from north-east to south-west. Through the intervening valleys the rivers flow down impetuously over ledges of granite or quartz. The rocky crests lie bare and exposed, but the shoulders are covered with low underbrush, and the bases with considerable trees. The principal chain in the District is that on which the fort of Kar\u00e1r is situated. It rises in Garoth\u00e1 pargan\u00e1, and runs parallel with the Betw\u00e1 river, till it is finally lost in the clusters of hills in the neighbourhood of Barw\u00e1 S\u00e1gar. Northward of the hilly region stretches an intermediate strip of broken country, dotted with isolated heights, and deeply excavated near the banks of the larger rivers by short watercourses which drain the surrounding table-land. Here the rocky granite chains gradually lose themselves in clusters of smaller hills, amongst which are situated a series of magnificent artificial lakes, partially surrounded by the overhanging heights, and enclosed on their open sides by embankments of solid masonry. Some of them belong to the same age as those in the District of Hamirpur, having been constructed about 900 years since by the Chandel R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Mahoba; but others date back no further than the 17th or 18th century, and are the work of Bundela princes. The principal of these lakes are the Barw\u00e1 S\u00e1gar, situated twelve miles east of Jh\u00e1nsi; the Arj\u00e1r lake, about eight miles east of Barw\u00e1 S\u00e1gar; and the Kachney\u00e1 lake, about eight miles east of Arj\u00e1r on the road to Mau.\n\nThe northern portion of Jh\u00e1nsi consists of the level plain of Bundelkhand, distinguished for its deep black soil, known as m\u00e1r, and admirably adapted for the cultivation of cotton. The District is intersected\nor bounded by three principal rivers\u2014the Pah\u00faj, the Betw\u00e1, and the Dhas\u00e1n, all of which are liable to be flooded in the rainy season; and on these occasions Jh\u00e1nsi is almost completely cut off from communication with the outer world. There are many minor streams, most of which are feeders of the Dhas\u00e1n. Government forest lands occupy about 23,000 acres. The principal forest tract, and the only one in which teak and timber trees of any size are found, is the B\u00e1bina jungle, lying along the banks of the Betw\u00e1 in the southern portion of pargan\u00e1 Jh\u00e1nsi. There are four other patches of scrub jungle along the eastern boundary of the District, near the Dhas\u00e1n, the principal trees, or rather bushes, being the khair (Acacia catechu), reung\u00e1 (Acacia leucophloa), and dh\u00e1k (Butea frondosa). In addition to the forest tracts, there are nine grass preserves, or r\u00fands, the produce of which is annually put up to auction by the Forest Department. The wild animals common to the District include the tiger, leopard, many varieties of deer, the hyena, wolf, lynx, and wild dog. Among birds are the bustard, partridge, grouse, quail, plover, and the usual species of wild goose, duck, and teal.\n\nHistory.\u2014The Parih\u00e1rs, a R\u00e1jput tribe, are pointed out by tradition as the earliest Aryan immigrants into Jh\u00e1nsi, where they still possess 24 villages. But nothing is known with certainty as to the history of this District before the period of Chandel rule, about the 11th century of our era. (See HAMIRPUR.) To this epoch must be referred the artificial reservoirs and architectural remains of the hilly region. After the overthrow of the Mahoba dynasty, the Chandels were succeeded in this portion of their dominions by their servants the Kh\u00e1ngars, who built the fort of Kar\u00e1r, now lying just outside the British border, on an intrusive spur of the Orchha State. About the 14th century, the Kh\u00e1ngars in their turn fell before the first fierce irruption of the Bundelas, a spurious R\u00e1jput tribe, who poured down upon the plains from the southern mountains, and placed their earliest capital at Mau (Mhow). Thence they attacked and conquered the fortress of Kar\u00e1r, and gradually spread themselves over the whole region which now bears their name. The great Bundela leader, Rudra Prat\u00e1p, from whom most of the distinguished families in Bundelkhand trace their descent, founded the city of Orchha, which thenceforth became the capital of his race. Under his descendants, the District long practically maintained its independence of the Musalm\u00e1ns, though the Orchha R\u00e1j\u00e1s from time to time made formal payments of tribute to the court of Delhi.\n\nIn the early part of the 17th century, the Orchha State was governed by B\u00edr Singh Deo, who built the fort of Jh\u00e1nsi. He incurred the heavy displeasure of Akbar, by the murder of Abul Fazl, the Emperor\u2019s favourite minister and historian, at the instigation of Prince Sal\u00edm,\nafterwards known as the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. A force was accordingly sent against him in 1602, the country was ravaged and devastated, but B\u00eer Singh himself contrived to escape. On the accession of his patron, Sal\u00edm, in 1605, he was naturally pardoned, and rose into great favour. But when, on the death of that Emperor in 1627, Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n mounted the throne, B\u00eer Singh revolted. His rebellion was unsuccessful; and although he was permitted to keep possession of his dominions, he never regained all his former power and independence. During the troubled times which succeeded, Orchha was sometimes in the hands of the Musalm\u00e1ns, and sometimes fell under the power of the Bundela chieftains, Champat R\u00e1i and his son Chhatar S\u00e1l. When, in 1707, the last-named national leader obtained from Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h a confirmation in the possessions which he had conquered, the present District of Jh\u00e1nsi was included in the grant. But even after this nominal pacification, the Muhammadan subahd\u00e1rs continued to make irruptions into the Bundela country; and in 1732, Chhatar S\u00e1l found it expedient to call in the aid of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who were then invading the Central Provinces under their first Peshw\u00e1, B\u00e1j\u00ed Rao. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, never slow to insinuate themselves where opportunity offered, came to his assistance with their accustomed promptitude, and were rewarded on the R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s death, in 1734, by a bequest of one-third of his dominions. The territory so granted included portions of the modern Division of Jh\u00e1nsi, but not the existing District itself. In 1742, however, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s found a pretext for attacking the Orchha State, and annexing that amongst other territories. Their general founded the city of Jh\u00e1nsi, and peopled it with the inhabitants of Orchha.\n\nThe District remained under the power of the Peshw\u00e1s for some thirty years, but after that period the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 viceroys made themselves independent in all but name. Seo R\u00e1o Bhao was subahd\u00e1r, or governor, when the British first began to interest themselves in the affairs of Bundelkhand. By sanad, dated February 8, 1804, British protection was promised him; and this arrangement was confirmed by treaty in October 1806. Seo R\u00e1o Bhao died in 1814, and was succeeded by his grandson, R\u00e1mchand R\u00e1o. In June 1817, the Peshw\u00e1 ceded to the East India Company his rights over Bundelkhand; and in November of the same year, the Government acknowledged the hereditary title of R\u00e1mchand R\u00e1o and his descendants to all their existing possessions. In 1832, the title of subahd\u00e1r was changed for that of R\u00e1j\u00e1. R\u00e1mchand R\u00e1o proved a weak and inefficient administrator, his revenues fell considerably in amount, and his territories were overrun and plundered by the native tribes beyond the Pah\u00faj. Much injury was inflicted upon the cultivators, who have scarcely yet recovered from their losses at this period. R\u00e1mchand R\u00e1o died without issue in 1835. Four claimants appeared for his territories, and the British Government recognised his\ngreat-uncle, Raghun\u00e1th R\u00e1o, the second son of Seo R\u00e1o Bhao, as heir to the principality. Under his administration, the revenue fell again to one-fourth of the sum which it had produced even during the management of his predecessor. His extravagance and debauchery compelled him to mortgage part of his territories to the Gwalior and Orchha States. He died heavily in debt, and without legitimate issue, in 1836.\n\nFour claimants again presented themselves for the vacant succession, and a commission was appointed by the British Government to investigate their claims. Meanwhile, the Political Agent in Bundelkhand assumed the administration, in the interests of civil order. The decision of the commission was given in favour of Gang\u00e1dhar R\u00e1o, brother of the last R\u00e1j\u00e1, and sole surviving male descendant of Seo R\u00e1o Bhao. As the new prince was of weak intellect, it was determined to carry on the administration by British agency, and to allow the R\u00e1j\u00e1 a fixed pension, on the understanding that the administration should be restored to him as soon as the principality was relieved from the state of disorder into which it had fallen. A Superintendent was appointed, under whom the revenue immediately rose to double its previous amount. In 1842, the management was restored to Gang\u00e1dhar R\u00e1o, whose administration, judged by a native standard, proved satisfactory. The assessments, however, were high, and although not unfairly collected, pressed heavily on the people. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 himself granted some partial remissions in years of scarcity, and was personally popular. Gang\u00e1dhar R\u00e1o died childless in 1853, and his territories lapsed to the British Government. The Jh\u00e1nsi State, with Jal\u00e1un and Chanderi Districts, were then formed into a Superintendency, while a pension was granted to the R\u00e1n\u00ed or widow of the late R\u00e1j\u00e1. The R\u00e1n\u00ed, however, considered herself aggrieved, both because she was not allowed to adopt an heir, and because the slaughter of cattle was permitted in the Jh\u00e1nsi territory. Reports were spread which excited the religious prejudices of the Hindus.\n\nThe events of 1857 accordingly found Jh\u00e1nsi ripe for rebellion. In May, it was known that the troops were disaffected; and on the 5th of June, a few men of the 12th Native Infantry seized the fort containing the treasure and magazine. Many European officers were shot the same day. The remainder, who had taken refuge in a fort, capitulated a few days after, and were massacred with their families to the number of 66 persons, in spite of a promise of protection sworn on the Kur\u00e1n and Ganges water. The R\u00e1n\u00ed then attempted to seize the supreme authority; but the usual anarchic quarrels arose between the rebels, during which the Orchha leaders laid siege to Jh\u00e1nsi, and plundered the country mercilessly. Numbers of the cultivators were hopelessly impoverished at this time, and it will be long before the damage then inflicted can be repaired. On the 5th of April 1858, the fort and town\nwere recovered by Sir Hugh Rose, who marched on to K\u00e1lpi without being able to leave a garrison at Jh\u00e1nsi. After his departure, the rebellion broke out afresh, only the G\u00farsar\u00e1i chieftain in the north remaining faithful to the British cause. On the 11th August, a flying column under Colonel Liddell cleared out the rebels from Mau (Mhow); and, after a series of sharp contests with various guerilla leaders, the work of re-organization was fairly set on foot in November. The R\u00e1n\u00ed herself had previously fled with T\u00e1nti\u00e1 Top\u00ed, and finally fell in battle at the foot of the rock fortress of Gwalior. Since that time, Jh\u00e1nsi has remained a British District, and famines and floods alone have disturbed the course of the civil administration.\n\nJh\u00e1nsi forms an unfortunate example of an Indian District which has suffered alike from the calamities of nature, and from the results of native misrule. Its uncertain rainfall, with the sudden floods and protracted droughts to which it is subject, will be referred to hereafter in the proper sections of this article. The pressure of high assessments under its Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rulers and R\u00e1j\u00e1s reduced the petty landholders and the peasantry to a very low standard of living. Occasional outbursts of furious misgovernment by half-insane debauchees intensified the general misery. Jh\u00e1nsi was one of our most recently-acquired Districts in the North-Western Provinces, and when it lapsed to the British in 1853, it was in an impoverished state. The whole agricultural population was in debt to the village money-lenders. Under the native system, such debts went on from father to son; but the creditor could seldom sell up or utterly ruin the debtor, as the latter process would drive the ruined man off the land, and so deprive the Raj\u00e1 of a rent-paying unit. The introduction of British rule brought with it the law of sale for debt, and the disorders of 1857\u201358 still further increased the wretchedness of the people. Famines and floods have also contributed to their misery, and the British Government had at length to face the fact that Jh\u00e1nsi was a bankrupt District. After a series of attempted palliatives, the Jh\u00e1nsi Encumbered Estates Act was passed in 1882. This Act practically amounts to a rural Insolvency Law for the District. It accepts the fact that a large number of the landholders cannot pay their debts, and it provides a procedure for an inquiry into the character of their liabilities, for a reduction of the same in cases where exorbitant interest has been taken, and for the ultimate discharge of the debtor. This procedure is worked by a special judge appointed for the purpose. Besides the equitable reduction of his debts, it provides a system of Government loans at low interest to the insolvent debtor, and eventually for the purchase of the encumbered estate by Government if no other course will suffice to meet the case of the insolvent. The Act has not yet been in force for a sufficient length of time to render it safe to offer an opinion here as to its ultimate\nconsequences. Meanwhile, as will be hereafter mentioned, the Government assessment on the land has been fixed at a low rate.\n\nPopulation.\u2014No District in the plains of the North-Western Provinces, with the exception of L\u00e1itpur, is so sparsely inhabited as Jh\u00e1nsi; and the population, though considerably increased since the introduction of British rule, has declined slightly under the pressure of famine in late years. The total number of inhabitants in 1865 was returned at 357,442; in 1872, it had fallen to 317,826, showing a decrease in eight years of 39,616 persons, or 11\u00b708 per cent. In 1881, the population had slightly increased to 333,227, although it was still 24,215 below the figures for 1855. The area in 1881 was computed at 1567 square miles; the number of towns and villages was returned as 625, and the number of houses at 54,404. These figures yield the following averages:\u2014Persons per square mile, 212; villages per square mile, 0\u00b739; houses per square mile, 34\u00b77; persons per village, 531; persons per house, 6\u00b71. The sparseness of the population must be set down to the numerous misfortunes which have befallen Jh\u00e1nsi in recent times. Excessive taxation, depredations by the mutineers in 1857-58, the growth of k\u00e1ns grass, famine, floods, and epidemics caused thousands to emigrate, besides the direct loss of life. But even under these unfavourable conditions, the population has increased since the days of native rule. The estimates formed in 1832 gave a population of 286,000 for 2922 square miles, then included in Jh\u00e1nsi. The jurisdiction has been reduced to 1567 square miles, and the population in 1881 had increased even in this smaller area to 333,227 persons. Classified according to sex, there were, in 1881\u2014males 172,884, and females 160,343; percentage of males to total population, 51\u00b79. Classified according to age, there were, under 15 years\u2014males 63,409, and females 54,259; total children, 117,668, or 35\u00b721 per cent.: 15 years and upwards\u2014males 109,475, and females 106,084; total adults, 215,559, or 64\u00b779 per cent.\n\nAs regards religious distinctions, the District is essentially Hindu, and the practice of killing cattle for food is one of the grievances complained of under British rule. Hinduism is professed by 316,429 persons, or 94\u00b796 per cent. of the inhabitants. There are 13,758 Musalm\u00e1ns, or 4\u00b71 per cent., who hold only 4 villages, and possess no social or political importance. Jains number 2288; Sikhs, 70; and P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 7. The Brahma Sam\u00e1j has formed no settlement in the District. There is a Christian population of 675, consisting almost entirely of troops in the cantonment of Mau, besides the European civil officers at the head-quarters station. Europeans number 621; Eurasians, 20; and Native Christians, 34.\n\nWith regard to distinctions of caste among the Hindus, there are 35,073 Br\u00e1hmans, the most numerous class in the District except\nthe Cham\u00e1rs; and they hold 102 villages, being a greater number than any other body, except the Ah\u00edrs. The R\u00e1jputs number 16,591, and hold 66 villages. Their most numerous clan is that of the Bundelas, the old dominant race, who, however, like many others included in the above total, are not held to be of pure R\u00e1jput blood. The K\u00e1yasths, or writer caste, number 6580. The Baniy\u00e1s, or trading classes, number 10,763. But the mass of the Hindu population is composed of S\u00fadras and those classified as 'other castes' in the Census Report, who amount in the aggregate to 247,422 persons, or four-fifths of the total Hindu inhabitants. Amongst them, the Cham\u00e1rs are the largest body, being returned at 44,390 persons; but they hold only one village. Next come the K\u00e1chh\u00eds, who number 30,149, and hold seven villages. The Kor\u00eds are reckoned at 20,191, but hold no villages, being chiefly employed as weavers in the larger towns. The Ah\u00edrs, who number 23,853, are the most important of the lower castes, owning as many as 107 villages. Other leading tribes are the Lodh\u00eds, with 25,066 persons and 68 villages; and the Kurm\u00eds, with 13,087 persons and 44 villages. Aboriginal tribes number 1809, but in the religious classification of the Census they are returned as Hindus.\n\nJh\u00e1nsi District contains five towns with a population exceeding five thousand in 1881, namely, Mau (Mhow), 15,981; Ranipur, 6846; Gursarai, 6528; Barwa Sagar, 6315; and Bhander, 5665. Jhansi, the head-quarters station, although a military cantonment and a municipality, contains a population of only 2473. Total urban population, 43,748, or 13\u00b72 per cent. of the District population. Of the 625 towns and villages comprising the District in 1881, 196 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 193 from two to five hundred; 166 from five hundred to a thousand; 57 from one to two thousand; 4 from two to three thousand; 4 from three to five thousand; 4 from five to ten thousand; and 1 upwards of fifteen thousand inhabitants. As regards occupation, the Census classified the male population under the following six main headings:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including all military and civil servants of Government, and the learned professions, 5429; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, etc., 1009; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 2898; (4) agricultural and pastoral, including gardeners, 73,462; (5) industrial, including all manufacturers and artisans, 29,258; (6) indefinite and non-productive, comprising general labourers, male children, etc., 60,828.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Jh\u00e1nsi, in the nature of its soil, the character of its people, the poor means of irrigation, and the want of good communications, is perhaps worse off than any other District in the North-Western Provinces, except its still more unfortunate neighbour, L\u00e1l\u00edtpur. In the best seasons, its produce is only just sufficient to feed its scanty and scattered population, and droughts or floods expose it to the greatest\nhardships. Out of a total area of 1,002,734 acres, only 428,348 acres were under cultivation in 1866, and 459,560 acres in 1881, the assessed cultivated area being 411,584 acres. The year is divided into the usual rain and cold-weather seasons. The principal kharif or rain crops are\u2014jo\u00e1r (millet), which in 1881 occupied 93,975 acres; cotton, grown on 34,074 acres; and bajra (another millet), on 10,893 acres. There were also 21,400 acres under til, an oil-seed, and 21,300 acres under a kind of pulse known as kodo. The total area of the rain crops was 232,054 acres, of which 26,080 acres were devoted to fibres, dye-stuffs, and oil-seeds. The rab\u00ed or cold-weather crops covered an area of 182,058 acres, of which 3228 acres were cultivated with oil-seeds. The chief rab\u00ed products were\u2014wheat, 113,779 acres; gram, 45,348 acres; and barley, 1374 acres. There were also 8882 acres employed in raising the \u00e1l dye, procured from the root of the Morinda citrifolia, a rain crop, which is only dug up every third year. It is commercially the most important product, and is grown on the best land. The town of Mauranipur has long been famous for the manufacture of a red cloth called kharu\u00e1, which is dyed from this root. The colour imparted by \u00e1l is fixed by alum, and is permanent. In Jh\u00e1nsi, as in other parts of Bundelkhand, the \u00e1l is really what enables the cultivators in certain villages to pay their rent; and in many years food would be scarce but for the importation of grain in return for the exports of the dye. The destructive k\u00e1ns grass formerly proved as great a pest here as elsewhere in Bundelkhand, but it has now been almost eradicated. Although the ordinary food production of Jh\u00e1nsi is barely adequate to the necessities of the people, the District has occasional years of exceptionally favourable rainfall, in which a considerable exportation of grain takes place.\n\nIrrigation is little practised. There are, indeed, some channels in connection with the artificial lakes before mentioned, but these are in a ruinous state, and water very little land in comparison with their original capacities. Most of them leak, and they require thorough renovation before they can be employed to any good purpose. Improvements, however, have been commenced, and will doubtless succeed in greatly benefiting the District. A scheme for restoring some of the most useful tanks, and for enlarging others, has been sanctioned, and work commenced. The construction of the Betw\u00e1 Canal has also been commenced as a part of the Bundelkhand irrigation scheme. The larger half of the land is held by proprietors or tenants having occupancy rights. The landowners themselves cultivate 40\u00b787 per cent. of the tilled land; tenants paying by lump sum not liable to enhancement, 16\u00b75 per cent.; tenants liable to enhancement, 10\u00b79 per cent.; and tenants-at-will, 32\u00b76 per cent. The native governments acknowledged no proprietary rights; and there have been great difficulties accordingly in settling what persons should be regarded as tenants and landowners respectively.\nThe male adult agriculturists in 1881, including agricultural labourers, numbered 70,630, cultivating an average of 6\u00bd acres each. The total population, however, dependent on the soil was 201,488, or 60\u00b747 per cent. The total male and female adult agriculturists numbered 122,084, of whom 18,439 were landholders, 224 estate agents, 67,769 cultivators, and 35,652 agricultural labourers. A holding of 50 acres would be considered as an unusually large farm for a single family; one of 25 acres as a very comfortable one, and one of 10 acres as small. A holding of 5 acres does not yield more than Rs. 3, or 6s. a month to the cultivator. As a rule, the cultivators, whether they have occupancy rights or are mere tenants-at-will, are very poor, living from hand to mouth, and unable to meet the loss of a single season\u2019s crop, especially in the tract between the Betw\u00e1 and the Dhas\u00e1n, which is specially liable to droughts and blights. The people are in a state of hereditary indebtedness to the village banker, the result of the frequent calamities of nature which afflict the District, together with the excessive rates of assessment imposed by the native R\u00e1j\u00e1s, and carried out by their British successors until the true state of the District was forced upon the knowledge of the Government. Total cultivated area, 704 square miles, of which 643\u00b71 square miles are assessed for Government revenue, which in 1881 amounted (including local rates and cesses paid on the land) to \u00a352,410, or an average of 2s. 6\u00bcd. per cultivated acre. Total rental paid by the cultivator, \u00a35,113,583, or an average of 5s. 0\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. The rates of rent vary from 2s. 11d. for the worst soils, to 9s. 4d. for the best. Wages have approximately doubled of late years. The present rates are as follows:\u2014First-class carpenters, 9d. to 1s. in towns, 7\u00bdd. in villages; second-class ditto, 3d. to 6d.; blacksmiths, 3d. to 7\u00bdd.; first-class masons, 4\u00bdd. to 6d.; first-class coolies, 3\u00bed.; second-class, 3d.; boys, 1\u00bed. Prices ruled as follows on the 1st January 1883:\u2014Wheat, 20\u00be sers the rupee, or 5s. 4\u00bdd. per cwt.; gram, 31\u00bd sers the rupee, or 3s. 6\u00bdd. per cwt.; b\u00edfra, 27 sers the rupee, or 4s. 2d. per cwt.; jo\u00e1r, 31\u00bc sers the rupee, or 3s. 6\u00bed. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Jh\u00e1nsi is specially exposed to blights, droughts, floods, hailstorms, epidemics, and their natural consequence, famine. Even in favourable years, the consumption of the District is estimated to exceed its production by one-fifth. This estimate represents the fact that the food produce of Jh\u00e1nsi in ordinary seasons scarcely exceeds the food demand, while it is considered that scarcity may be feared every five years on an average. The famines of 1783, 1833, 1837, and 1847 were particularly severe. The famine of 1868\u201369 was also felt very heavily in Jh\u00e1nsi. The autumn of 1868 had been a period of drought, during which the whole kharif crop was destroyed; and it was succeeded by torrents of rain in the subsequent year, by which the\nrabi was reduced to half its usual quantity. In July 1869, the bridges and roads were broken down by floods, and the whole country rendered impassable. Through the failure of the crops and the cutting off of communications, an absolute lack of food occurred. So long as the roads remained open, grain was imported in considerable quantities, under Government direction, from Cawnpur and S\u00e1gar; but after July 1869, the roads became useless, owing to the floods, and epidemics burst out among the starving people. Small-pox and sun-stroke carried off thousands of the enfeebled poor, while cholera and fever appeared with the rainy season. The number of deaths recorded rose from 3180 in 1868, to 20,331 in the succeeding year.\n\nRelief measures were early adopted, and poorhouses were opened at Jh\u00e1nsi in September 1858, at Mau and R\u00e1nipur in December, and at Barw\u00e1 S\u00e1g\u00e1r in February 1869. Thirteen famine works were also undertaken, in the shape of roads, bridges, and irrigation embankments. The daily average of persons relieved for thirteen months was 4494, of whom 2284 obtained gratuitous aid at poorhouses, and 2210 were employed on relief works. The total cost amounted to \u00a315,032.\n\nThe famine began to abate towards the end of 1869, but the District long continued to bear marks of distress. From 10 to 20 per cent. of land was thrown out of cultivation, partly owing to the loss of 150,000 head of cattle\u2014one-half the total stock\u2014and partly to the spread of k\u00e1ns grass, induced by the floods. Again in 1879, the failure of the rabi crops induced a partial famine, chiefly confined to pargand Moth. Relief works were opened, on which from one to two thousand persons were employed. A seasonable rainfall, however, soon relieved the distress. Famine rates are reached when the better grains sell at 10, and the poorer at 12, sers the rupee, or 11s. 2\u00bdd. and gs. 4d. per cwt. respectively. The means of communication are insufficient, especially in that portion of the District which lies between the Betw\u00e1 and the Dhas\u00e1n, where absolute failure of supplies may be expected in years of drought or flood. The intermixture of villages belonging to Native States renders the organization of relief a task of great difficulty.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014As the District is not able to supply its own wants in the matter of food-stuffs, it imports instead of exporting grain. In return, it gives the dl dye and cotton. There are no manufactures, except a little dyed cloth. A large transport trade, however, is conducted via Mau, between Central India and the Do\u00e1b. The District has no railway station within or adjoining its limits. The chief road is that from Jh\u00e1nsi through K\u00e1lpi to Cawnpur, having a length within the District of 41 miles, well bridged and metalled. The other roads are not good, and are liable to be cut off in times of flood. Total length of District roads, 701 miles. The District contains no printing press,\nbut there are two lithographic presses in the native city of Jh\u00e1nsi, just outside the borders, where work is executed in Urd\u00fa and Hind\u00ed.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1860, the revenue of Jh\u00e1nsi amounted to \u00a395,990, of which \u00a377,146, or more than three-fourths, was contributed by the land-tax. The expenditure at the same date reached the sum of \u00a349,551, or little more than one-half the revenue. In 1870, the total receipts had been reduced to \u00a387,987, of which sum only \u00a356,085 was contributed by the land-tax. The decrease, however, is partly due to the cession of three pargan\u00e1s to Gwalior in 1861. At the same time, the expenditure in 1871 had increased to \u00a359,112. The District revenue, however, continued steadily to decrease, and in 1881 amounted to only \u00a360,669, the land-tax having been reduced to \u00a344,076. The expenditure in 1881 was \u00a318,741, the decrease being largely due to the abolition of the inland customs staff. The present assessments of land revenue are intentionally very light, in order that the country may have time to recover itself. The land-tax as shown in this paragraph, is little more than one-half (\u00a344,076 in 1881) of what it was shortly after the District passed under British rule (\u00a377,146 in 1860).\n\nThe District is administered on the non-regulation system, under which civil, criminal, and fiscal functions vest in the same officer. Its affairs are managed by a Deputy Commissioner, two Assistant Commissioners, three extra-Assistant Commissioners, and four tahsild\u00e1rs. The Commissioner for the Jh\u00e1nsi Division is also stationed at Jh\u00e1nsi Nao\u00e1b\u00e1d. There are 10 magisterial and 10 civil courts. The regular police numbered, in 1882, 577 men, maintained at a cost of \u00a37287, of which sum \u00a3612 was paid from local sources. The village watchmen or chaukid\u00e1rs numbered 723 men, at an annual cost of \u00a32602. The whole machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property consisted of 1300 men, or 1 in every 252 inhabitants and every 1\u00b730 square miles, at a cost of \u00a39889, or 7d. per inhabitant. The total number of persons convicted of any offence was 881 in 1871, and 1870 in 1882, or 1 in every 180 of the population. The immense majority of convictions are for theft and housebreaking. There is one jail in the District, at the head-quarters station, besides a lock-up at Mau, the daily average number of prisoners in which was 234 in 1870, and 172 in 1882.\n\nEducation unfortunately shares in the general backwardness of Jh\u00e1nsi. Instead of progressing, it has steadily retrograded during the years 1860 to 1870. In the first-named year there were 173 schools in the District, with 3764 pupils, maintained at a cost of \u00a3957; in 1870, while the expenditure, chiefly borne by the State, had increased to \u00a31247, the number of schools had declined to 110, and the pupils numbered only 2235; in 1882, the State-inspected\nschools numbered only 63, and the pupils 1988. There are, however, a number of indigenous uninspected private schools; and the Census Report of 1881 returned 3015 boys and 56 girls as under instruction, besides 10,876 males and 140 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. The District is divided into 4 fiscal divisions (parganas), containing 623 estates; average land revenue paid by each estate in 1882, \u00a370, 1s. 7d. The District contains 2 municipalities, Mau with R\u00e1n\u00edpur, and Jh\u00e1nsi Naq\u00e1b\u00e1d. In 1875\u201376, their joint income amounted to \u00a31785, and their expenditure to \u00a31845. Municipal revenue in 1882\u201383, \u00a31618; expenditure, \u00a32117; incidence of municipal taxation, 1s. 0\u00bdd. per head of their population (25,300). The head-quarters station has a population of only 2473, and it is inconveniently close to the foreign city of Jh\u00e1nsi, in Gwalior State, which contains 26,772 inhabitants. Negotiations have several times been commenced for such exchanges of territory with the neighbouring native principalities as would render this straggling District more compact and more easily administered, but hitherto they have met with little success.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Jh\u00e1nsi, like that of Bundelkhand generally, is hot and very dry, owing to the want of trees or shade, and the radiation from bare rocks or arid wastes; but it is not considered unhealthy. The average mean annual temperature at the civil station is about 80\u00b0 F. In 1881, the general mean temperature was 79\u00b08', ranging from a maximum of 116\u00b03' in May and June, to a minimum of 42\u00b03' in January. The mean monthly temperature in 1881 was as follows: \u2014 January 65\u00b05', February 72\u00b06', March 75\u00b06', April 90\u00b03', May 96\u00b06', June 91\u00b03', July 82\u00b03', August 80\u00b04', September 83\u00b02', October 82\u00b07', November 71\u00b08', and December 65\u00b0. The annual rainfall for a period of twenty years ending 1881 was 35\u00b024 inches. In the latter year the rainfall was 53\u00b085 inches, or 18\u00b061 inches above the average. The population are habitually under-fed, and they consequently succumb readily to slight diseases. The total number of deaths recorded in 1882 was 12,852, or 38\u00b036 per thousand of the whole population; and of these, 6542 were assigned to fevers. There are two charitable dispensaries, namely at the civil station and at Mau-R\u00e1n\u00edpur. During the year 1883 they afforded medical relief to 401 in-door and 5425 out-door patients.

Area, 379 square miles, of which 186 were cultivated in 1872. Population in 1872, 72,861; in 1881, 80,971, namely, males 43,223, and females 37,748. In 1881, Hindus numbered 76,104; Muhammadans, 3544; Jains, 575; and 'others,' 748. Number of towns and villages, 166. Land revenue (1882), \u00a38,583; total Government revenue, including local rates and cesses, \u00a310,697; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a321,752. The tahs\u00edl contains 1 civil and 1 criminal court, with 11 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), a regular police force of 94 officers and men, besides 123 village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs).\n\nJh\u00e1nsi Nao\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Village and administrative head-quarters of Jh\u00e1nsi District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 25\u00b0 27' 30\" N., long. 78\u00b0 37' E. The village lies at the extreme western limit of the District, close under the walls of Jh\u00e1nsi city, which is now included within the Native State of Gwalior. The fort, also belonging to Gwalior, overlooks and commands the civil station and military cantonment. The population of the village and civil station, which in 1872 was only 536, had increased by 1881 to 2473. Jh\u00e1nsi Nao\u00e1b\u00e1d stands in the midst of a wild and rocky country, and is cut off from communication with other British posts during seasons of flood on the Betw\u00e1. In the summer months the heat is intense, the thermometer often standing at 108\u00b0 F. in the shade up to 6 p.m. Previous to the cession of pargan\u00e1s Pachor, Karera, and part of Jh\u00e1nsi to Gwalior in 1861, the headquarters occupied a central position; but they now stand quite at one side of the present District. Lines exist in the cantonment for European and native troops. The civil station is a straggling village, consisting of the residences of the officials, together with court-houses, tahs\u00edli, police station, dispensary, schools, and post-office. Municipal revenue in 1882-83, \u00a3106; from taxes, \u00a372, or 7d. per head of population.\n\nJh\u00e1rcha.\u2014Town in Sikandar\u00e1b\u00e1d tahs\u00edl, Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Jarcha.\n\nJhari\u00e1.\u2014Coal-field in M\u00e1nbh\u00fam District, Bengal, situated in the pargan\u00e1 of the same name, a few miles s. and s.e. of P\u00e1rasn\u00e1th Hill, Bengal. The following notice is extracted from a paper by Mr. F. Hughes, published in vol. v. of the Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India:\u2014The field commences at a distance of about 170 miles from Calcutta, nearly south of the village of Gobindpur on the Grand Trunk Road, and extends east and west for about 18 miles, its greatest breadth, in a line north and south, being about 10 miles. The general truth, that geological structure mainly determines the physical appearance of a country, is admirably illustrated and borne out in the present instance, the configuration of the surface of the ground\npresenting the same uniform type of aspect which is common in areas composed of coal-bearing rocks, and resembling in almost every detail the appearances exhibited by the R\u00e1n\u00edganj field. The coal area generally is flat, and nowhere rises into undulating scenery. There is scarcely a single elevation worthy of the name of a hill; only a few low ridges and escarpments, principally along the eastern and northern boundaries of the field, where the hard grits and sandstones of the lower, or Bar\u00e1kh\u00e1r, division of the D\u00e1modar series crop out. The excellence of the coal in the R\u00e1n\u00edganj group of the R\u00e1n\u00edganj field is well known; but in the Jhari\u00e1 field, although there are many seams in the upper series superior to some in the Bar\u00e1khars, the finest coal and the freest from ash occurs in the latter. In the Karharb\u00e1ri field, 28 to 30 miles north of the Jhari\u00e1 field, much of the coal there, exclusively of Bar\u00e1kh\u00e1r age, is superior to that of other districts, some of it yielding on assay as small an amount of ash as 2\u00b75 and 4 per cent. Coking coal, as far as experiments have yet been made, is found only there; and the evidence both in that and the present field tends to show that, whatever the average superiority of the coal in the R\u00e1n\u00edganj group over those of the Bar\u00e1khars may be, the best quality of coal is found amongst the latter. In making a comparison of the economic values of the two series in this field, it must be remembered that, in addition to the comparative size of the seams, their freedom from partings, and their constancy, the question of the amount of dip enters largely into the subject. In India, where appliances for working collieries are necessarily limited, and human labour is in many cases the only power available, a slight increase in the angle of inclination would necessitate such an addition to the expenditure, owing to the greater depth from which the water would have to be pumped out and the coal raised, that whereas a seam dipping at 12\u00b0 and 16\u00b0 might profitably be worked, one inclined at 20\u00b0 or even 18\u00b0 would have to be abandoned, unless its superior quality enabled it to fetch a higher price in the market. Bearing this in mind, then, it is evident from what has been stated in this report that seams in the Bar\u00e1kh\u00e1r group have the great advantage over those in the R\u00e1n\u00edganj series of dipping at much smaller angles, thus affording greater facilities for being worked. Indeed, the inclination throughout the R\u00e1n\u00edganj group is so high, that its economic value may be set down as being nearly nil until the seams of the Bar\u00e1kh\u00e1r group shall have been exhausted.\n\n**Jharia Garkhari.**\u2014State in Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See DANG STATES.\n\n**Jheend.**\u2014Native State in the Punjab.\u2014See JIND.\n\n**Jhelum.**\u2014River, District, tahsil, and town in the Punjab.\u2014See JEHLAM.\n\n**Jhind.**\u2014Native State in the Punjab.\u2014See JIND.\nJhinjhuw\u00e1r\u00e1.\u2014Petty State in the Jhal\u00e1w\u00e1r Sub-division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency. Area, 165 square miles. Population (1881) 15,766. Jhinjhuw\u00e1r\u00e1 consists of 17 villages, with 9 independent tribute-payers. The revenue in 1876 was estimated at \u00a38000. Tribute of \u00a31107, 7s. is paid to the British Government. Inhabitants mostly Kol\u00eds. There were formerly three salt-works in this State. They are all now closed, and the t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs receive on this account an annual compensation from the British Government. Saltpetre is also found in the State. A portion of the adjacent Rann, with several small islands, is owned by the State. Jhil\u00e1nand, the principal of these islands, is about 10 square miles in area, and contains several small tanks and a hot spring called Bhotwa. Anand, a king afflicted with leprosy, is said to have been marvellously cured of his disease by bathing in this spring.\n\nJhinjhuw\u00e1r\u00e1.\u2014Town in the Petty State of Jhinjhuw\u00e1r\u00e1 in the Jh\u00e1law\u00e1r Division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Gujar\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 23\u00b0 21' N., long. 71\u00b0 42' E. Population (1872) 3058; (1881) 3770. Jhinjhuw\u00e1r\u00e1 is an ancient town with a fort and well-built cut-stone reservoir or tank. The gates of the ruined outer fortifications are fine specimens of ancient Hindu architecture. Many of the stones bear the inscription Mahansri Udal; tradition declares this Udal to have been the minister of Sidraj Jayasingh of Anhilw\u00e1r\u00e1 P\u00e1tan, to whom is ascribed the construction of both fort and tank, and who is said to have been born here. Jhinjhuw\u00e1r\u00e1 fell under the Sult\u00e1ns of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d and became one of their fortified posts. Afterwards it was a th\u00e1n\u00e1 of the Mughal Government under Akb\u00e1r. On the decay of the empire it was wrested from them by Kambhoji, the ancestor of the present t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs, who claim to have been originally Jh\u00e1l\u00e1s of the Dhr\u00e1ngadra house, but were outcasted owing to intermarriage with Kol\u00eds. Jhinjhuw\u00e1r\u00e1 is said to have been founded by one Jhunjho, a Rab\u00e1ri.

An ancient town traditionally dating from 2200 B.C. in the Puranic age as the city of Kesi or Pratisth\u00e1n, and the residence of the first prince of the Lunar dynasty, Pururavas. In the time of Akbar, the place was one of the triangle of cities (Pray\u00e1g and Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d being the two others) forming the centre from which the *subah* of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d was ruled. The town consists of a new and an old quarter, the former containing (1881) 2267, and the latter 1404 inhabitants\u2014total, 3671. A bridge of boats in the dry season, and a ferry during the rains, connects Jh\u00fasi with D\u00e1r\u00e1ganj, a suburb of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, on the other side of the river. It is a station of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, and contains an imperial post-office and first-class police station.

In 1857, the revenue surveyor stated that Ji\u00e1ganj carried on a large trade in cotton, saltpetre, sugar, rice, and silk. According to the registration returns of 1876-77, the total imports were valued at \u00a3123,000, chiefly salt, oil-seeds, tobacco, and *gh\u012b*; the principal exports were piece-goods and rice. No later returns are available, owing to an alteration in the system of river registration of trade.\n\n**Jigni.**\u2014Petty State under the Bundelkhand Agency, Central India. Area, 21\u00b728 square miles. Population (1881) 3427, dwelling in 6 villages, containing 510 houses. Density of population, 165\u00b77 persons per square mile; houses per village, 24; persons per house, 6\u00b77. Hindus number 3339; Muhammadans, 88. Jigni State is situated south of the Betw\u00e1, at its confluence with the Dhas\u00e1n river in the north-west of Ham\u00edrpur District. The State, at the time of the British\noccupation of Bundelkhand, consisted of 14 villages, which were attached in consequence of contumacy, but 6 villages were restored in 1810. The present R\u00e1o J\u00e1gird\u00e1r is named Lakshman Singh, a Hindu Bundela. He holds a sanad of adoption. The revenue of the State is about \u00a31400. There is a military force of about 57 infantry.\n\n**Jilo or Jilo-P\u00e1tan.**\u2014Town in the Tourw\u00e1ti District of the Jaipur State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Population (1881) 5941, namely, 3417 males and 2524 females. Hindus numbered 5492, and Muhammadans 449.\n\n**Jind (Jh\u00ednd).**\u2014One of the Native States situated to the east of the Sutlej (Satlaj) river, under the political superintendence of the Government of the Punjab. It consists of three or four isolated tracts, with a total area of 1232 square miles. The principality, which is one of the Phulki\u00e1n States (see Patiala), was founded in 1763, and the chief was recognised as R\u00e1j\u00e1 by the Emperor of Delhi in 1768. The R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Jind have always been steady adherents of the British Government. Among the foremost and most sincere of those who proffered their allegiance after the overthrow of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s was R\u00e1j\u00e1 B\u00e1gh Singh of J\u00ednd; and the good offices of this chief were not unimportant in the negotiations which followed the advance of Lord Lake in pursuit of Holkar to the banks of the Beas (Bi\u00e1s). In recognition of these services, Lord Lake confirmed to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 the grants of land he held under the Emperors of Delhi, and under Sindhia. After the Sutlej campaign, the Governor-General bestowed a grant of land of about \u00a3300 a year in value on the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of J\u00ednd, as a mark of satisfaction with his conduct. In 1857, Swar\u00fap Singh, then R\u00e1j\u00e1, was the first to march against the mutineers at Delhi. His troops acted as the vanguard of the army, and he remained in the British camp until the re-occupation of the city, and a portion of his troops took part in the assault. For these services he received a grant of additional territory, yielding \u00a311,681 per annum, on condition of fidelity and political and military service in time of difficulty and danger. The present R\u00e1j\u00e1, Raghb\u00edr Singh, G.C.S.I., is a Sikh of the Sidhu J\u00e1t tribe, and is entitled to a salute of 11 guns. At the Imperial Assemblage at Delhi on January 1, 1877, he was appointed a Counsellor of the Empress.\n\nThe J\u00ednd territory comprises an area of 1232 square miles, and has a population returned in 1881 at 249,862, namely, males 136,909, and females 112,953. Hindus numbered 210,627; Muhammadans, 34,247; Sikhs, 4335; Jains, 649; Christians, 3; unspecified, 1. The State contains 8 towns, 415 villages, and 51,394 houses, of which 42,078 are occupied and 9316 unoccupied. Number of resident families, 62,787. Average density of population, 203 persons per square mile. The revenue has rapidly increased of late years, and is now between 6 and 7 l\u00e1khs of rupees, or between \u00a360,000 and \u00a370,000. The military force consists of 6 horse and 6 mule guns,\n234 artillerymen, 392 cavalry, 1600 infantry. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 supplies 25 horsemen for general service in British territory.\n\n**J\u00ednd.**\u2014Chief town of J\u00ednd State, Punjab, and residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1; situated in lat. 29\u00b0 19' N., and long. 76\u00b0 23' E. Population (1881) 7136, namely, Hindus, 4092; Muhammadans, 2823; Sikhs, 65; Jains, 155; and unspecified, 1. Number of houses. 1619.\n\n**Jinjir\u00e1.**\u2014State and port in Bombay Presidency.\u2014See JANJIRA.\n\n**Jinjir\u00e1m.**\u2014River in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Assam; rises in swamps between Agi\u00e1gram and Lakhipur, and flows westward nearly parallel to the Brahmaputra, from which also it receives a partial overflow in the rains, till it falls into that river below Manika char. Another river is marked in the Survey maps named Jinjir\u00e1m, but is really called the Jin\u00e1ri. It rises in the G\u00e1ro Hills, and flows north into Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, emptying itself into the Brahmaputra a few miles above the town of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1. Both streams are navigable during the rains by boats of 2 tons burthen.\n\n**J\u00edr\u00e1.**\u2014Village in the south of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Assam, on the left or west bank of the Krishn\u00e1\u00ed river, at the foot of the G\u00e1ro Hills. The weekly market is frequented by G\u00e1ros, who bring down lac and other products of their hills to exchange for cotton goods, salt, rice, dried fish, etc. J\u00edr\u00e1 has given its name to a dw\u00e1r or lowland tract in the G\u00e1ro Hills, where valuable s\u00e1l timber is found.\n\n**Jir\u00e1l.**\u2014Petty State of the Sankhera Mehwas, Gori group, in Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency. It is divided among three shareholders, who are also the proprietors of K\u00e1msoli Moti and K\u00e1msoli N\u00e1ni, the total area of the three estates being 5 square miles. The estimated revenue of Jir\u00e1l in 1881 was \u00a3170, of which \u00a37 is paid as tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda.\u2014See KAMSOLI MOTI and KAMSOLI NANI.\n\n**Jirang.**\u2014Petty State in the Kh\u00e1si Hills, Assam; presided over by a sard\u00e1r named Moit Singh. Population (1881) 720. Natural products\u2014rice, chillies, and caoutchouc. Cotton cloth is woven. Jirang contains some of the finest s\u00e1l forests in the Kh\u00e1si Hills.\n\n**Jiri.**\u2014River of Assam.\u2014See JHIRI.\n\n**Jobat.**\u2014Petty State under the Bhop\u00e1war or Bh\u00edl Agency, Central India; lying between 22\u00b0 24' and 22\u00b0 36' N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 37' and 74\u00b0 51' E. long. It is one of the offshoots of the Ali-R\u00e1jpur State, and consists of a small tract of hilly country, inhabited almost entirely by Bh\u00edls, which was left undisturbed during the turmoil which the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 invasions caused in M\u00e1lw\u00e1. The Vindhya mountains skirt the northern frontier, and spurs from them run into the State. The road from Indore via Dh\u00e1r, R\u00e1jpur (Ali-R\u00e1jpur) to Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), passes through the north-west corner of the State. The R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Jobat is a Rahtor R\u00e1jput. The area of the State is 132 square\nmiles. Population (1881) 9387, namely, 4812 males and 4575 females, dwelling in 69 villages, containing 1713 houses. Density of population, 71 persons per square mile; houses per square mile, 13; persons per house, 5.47. Hindus numbered 5293; Muhammadans, 168; aboriginal tribes, 3916; Jains, 10. Revenue (1876), \u00a31700.\n\nJobat.\u2014Town in the State of Jobat, under the Bhopawar Agency, Central India. Lat. 22\u00b0 26' 45\" N., long. 74\u00b0 35' 30\" E. Though the State is named after this town, it is not the capital. The minister of the State lives at Ghora, three miles distant, and State business is transacted there, though Ghor\u00e1 is only a large village, but healthier than Jobat, from which place it has been proposed to remove. The town of Jobat consists of a small collection of houses and a few shops, nestling under the fort of the R\u00e1n\u00e1, which is picturesquely situated on a steep rocky hill, shut closely in on three sides by forest-clad hills. The inhabitants suffer much from fever. Here are the treasury and the jail. The State dispensary is at Ghor\u00e1.\n\nJodhia or Joriya.\u2014Revenue division or mah\u00e1l, town, and chief port of Naw\u00e1nagar State in H\u00e1l\u00e1r Sub-division, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. The port was formerly a mere fishing village, on the south-eastern shores of the Gulf of Cutch. The wharf is about a mile and a half distant from the town, with which it is connected by a good made road. A custom-house and a press for cotton and wool bales are at the wharf. The water off this part of the coast is too shallow for ships of any considerable burthen. According to a local legend, the gulf from Jodhia to the opposite coast of Cutch could be crossed by a footpath at low water 200 years ago. The north-west bastion of the fort 80 feet above the sea, the palace or Darb\u00e1r house 300 yards southeast of the bastion, and a grove of trees a mile to the south and outside the town, are high and conspicuous marks in nearing the port from seaward. Population (1872) 6592; (1881) 6842, namely, 3377 males and 3465 females; Hindus numbered 4315, Muhaminadans 2150, Jains 372, and \u2018others\u2019 5. The town is situated in lat. 22\u00b0 40' N., long. 70\u00b0 26' 30\" E., about 24 miles north-east of Naw\u00e1nagar, 40 miles north-west of R\u00e1jkot, and 40 miles west of Morbi, and is surrounded by a wall with towers and a small interior fort. Post-office, vernacular boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 schools, and dispensary. Jodhia mah\u00e1l or revenue division has four subordinate divisions, Pardh\u00e1ri, B\u00e1lbambha, Hari\u00e1n\u00e1, and Vanathali. The head revenue and judicial officials of the division have their courts at Jodhia town.\n\nJodhpur (also called M\u00e1rw\u00e1r).\u2014Native State in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, under the Western R\u00e1jput\u00e1na States Agency. The State is bounded on the north by Bikaner (Bickaneer) and the Shaikhaw\u00e1t\u00ed District of Jaipur (Jeypore); on the east by Jaipur and Kishangarh; on the north-east by Ajmere-Merw\u00e1ra; on the south-east by Mewar (Mey-\nwar); on the south by Sirohi and P\u00e1l\u00e1npur; on the west by the Rann of Cutch (Kachch) and the Thar and P\u00e1rkar District of Sind; and on the north-west by the Native State of J\u00e1isalmer (Jeysulmere). It lies between lat. $24^\\circ 36'$ and $27^\\circ 42'$ N., and between long. $70^\\circ 6'$ and $75^\\circ 24'$ E. Its greatest length north-east and south-west is about 290 miles, and its greatest breadth 130 miles. It contains an area of 37,000 square miles, being the largest State in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. The population (1881) numbers 1,750,403, so that Jodhpur is the second most populous State in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. The State is the cradle of a long line of chiefs of the Rahtor clan of R\u00e1jputs.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The river L\u00fani is the most marked feature in the physical aspect of Jodhpur. It rises in the lake at Ajmere, and is first known as the S\u00e1g\u00e1r Mati, taking the name of L\u00fani after its junction at Govindgarh with the Sarsuti (Saraswati), which has its source in the Pushk\u00e1r Lake. From Govindgarh the river flows in a south-westerly direction through the State, and is finally lost in the marshy ground at the head of the Rann of Cutch. It is fed by numerous tributaries, chiefly from the Aravalli Hills. In heavy floods, which occur very rarely, it overflows its banks in the separate District of Mall\u00e1ni. The local name of this overflow is rel, and fine crops of wheat and barley are grown on the saturated soil. Wells are dug in the bed of the river in all the Districts of Jodhpur through which it flows, and in this way large tracts producing wheat and barley are irrigated. There is a saying in M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, that half the produce of the country, so far as cereals are concerned, is dependent on the L\u00fani. The river is, however, capricious and erratic. On one bank it may be a blessing, on the other a curse. This is seen in two villages in the Gura estate in the Mall\u00e1ni District. One is rich with crops, the other arid and bare; on one side the stream flows over sand, and its water is sweet,\u2014on the other, over a hard bed, and its water is briny. The L\u00fani attains its greatest breadth in the Sachor and Mall\u00e1ni Districts. Its water is, as a rule, saline or brackish, but that of wells sunk at a distance of 20 or 30 yards from the banks of the river is comparatively sweet, and the inhabitants of all the villages situated in its neighbourhood depend for their drinking supply on these wells. Melons and the singh\u00e1ra nut (Trapa bispinosa) are grown in great quantities in the bed of the river during the dry season. The chief tributaries of the L\u00fani are the Jojr\u00ed, the S\u00fakri, the Guyab\u00e1la, the Reria or P\u00e1li, the B\u00e1ndi, and the Jow\u00e1i. The only important lake is the famous salt lake of Sambh\u00e1r, on the borders of Jodhpur and Jaipur. Two other depressions of the same kind exist, one in the north of Jodhpur at D\u00eddw\u00e1n\u00e1, and the other in the south at Pachpadra. The out-turn of salt from these two latter lakes was, in 1877, 14\u00bd lakhs of maunds (say 52,000 tons). There are a few jhils or marshes in Jodhpur, notably one in the Sachor\nDistrict, which covers an area of 40 or 50 miles in the rainy season, and the bed of which, when dry, yields good crops of wheat and gram.\n\nThe geological characteristics of the country are somewhat complex. The south-eastern boundary, viz. that portion of Merw\u00e1ra and the Aravalli range within the frontier of the State, consists principally of metamorphic or transition rocks, rising precipitously from the plains of Jodhpur, and in some localities attaining an elevation of 3000 feet. These rocks are chiefly gneiss, hornblende, quartz, and mica-slate; but in the higher hills bands of basalt and porphyry are found, and occasionally granite, which, more towards the south, becomes the principal feature of the range, as at Abu. Passing from the Aravallis towards the west, the surface, even at the base of the mountain range, is found to be sandy; but the substratum appears to be chiefly gneiss, hornblende, mica-slate, and quartz, all of which may be seen cropping up through the sand, and in some places are from 800 to 1000 feet in height. The aspect of the country, therefore, as far as the L\u00fani river, which divides Jodhpur into two unequal parts, is that of a sandy plain, dotted with bold and picturesque conical hills or mers, rising to the elevation above mentioned. The most prominent of these formations are\u2014the N\u00e1dlai Hill, on which a colossal stone elephant has been placed; the Punnagir Hill, near Jadhan; the Sojat Hill; the Hill near Pali; the Hill near Gundoj; the Sanderao Hill; and the J\u00e1lor Hill. Immediately around these hills the ground is hard and stony, but gradually passes into sand, which becomes more heavy as the eastern and northern districts are approached. After crossing the L\u00fani, or at about one-third of the breadth of the State, these conical hills are less numerous, and sandstone appears, but the metamorphic rocks are not lost sight of until the range is passed on which the capital, JODHPUR, is situated.\n\nThe country to the north of Jodhpur city is one vast sandy plain, called the thal, only broken by sandhills or tebas, which, commencing in the State of Jodhpur, stretch into Bikaner in the north, and into Jaisalmer and Sind in the west and south. In the Mall\u00e1ni District these sandhills rise in places to a height of 300 or 400 feet, and this part of the country resembles an undulating sea of sand. Throughout the thal, an occasional oasis is met with; but water is exceedingly scarce, and often from 200 to 300 feet below the surface. It is conjectured that the substratum of this part of the country is sandstone, as that is passed through in sinking the deep wells, but no special investigations have been made. Zinc used to be obtained in large quantities near Sojat. The country is rich in salt, which is obtained in large quantities, chiefly from the natural salt lake of SAMBHAR. At Pachpadra, 35 miles south-west of Jodhpur, and at D\u00eddw\u00e1n\u00e1, Phalodi, and Pok\u00e1ran, salt is crystallized from the water of wells. The salt jh\u00edls of Sargot\nand Kachawan possess unknown capabilities for salt manufacture. But in addition to these salt sources, there are in the State 72 salt-producing villages, with 370 working factories. The method of obtaining the salt is extremely simple. At Pachpadra, for instance, the process is as follows:\u2014Oblong pits of various sizes are dug: a supply of brine percolates through the pit bed, and when that has become sufficiently concentrated so as to show signs of crystallization around the pit edge, branches of a thorny shrub called morali are sunk in it. On these branches salt crystals form and continue to grow for two or sometimes three years. At the end of that period the salt crop is extracted, usually in this way: men enter the pit, and with an iron chisel, wedge-shaped, and having a handle five feet long, they cut through the thorny branches, and break up the salt which is caked on the bottom. The branches, with the crystals attached, are carried to the edge of the pit, and the crystals are shaken or broken off. The salt thus broken up is drawn to the sides by a broad iron hoe, and is removed in baskets to the top of the pit. Marble exists in abundance at Makr\u00e1n\u00e1 in the north, and also in smaller masses near Gh\u00e1nir\u00e1o on the south-east border. Mult\u00e1ni matti or fuller\u2019s earth is found in considerable quantities at Kapuri; it is used by natives of all castes for washing the hair. This earth is taken for sale to Umarkot in Sind, to Jodhpur, and Bikaner. It sells on the spot at about 2 annas (3d.) a bullock-load.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of Jodhpur State consists of R\u00e1jputs, the conquerors and lords of the soil; Charans, Bh\u00e1ts, J\u00e1ts, Bishn\u00e1wis, Minas, and Bh\u00edls, the aboriginal inhabitants; and the usual mixed Hindu population, with a scanty proportion of Muhammadans. The Charans, a sacred race, hold large religious grants of land, and enjoy peculiar immunities as traders in local produce. The Bh\u00e1ts are by profession genealogists, but also engage in trade. The Minas, Baur\u00eds, and Bh\u00edls are predatory classes, but are employed in menial capacities. The Muhammadans are principally soldiers, the word sip\u00e1hi (sepoy) being used generally to designate a Muhammadan. The natives, as a race, are enterprising and industrious, but the agricultural classes have to undergo great privations from poor food, and often bad water. M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri traders are to be found throughout the peninsula, especially in the Deccan. Although far from his native State, the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri trader or money-lender remains loyal to the Jodhpur chief. When the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Takht Singh died, every M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri in Calcutta and Bombay shaved his head and face as a mark of mourning. The peaked turban is a peculiarity of the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri head-dress. In pursuit of trade, the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris quit their homes for years, only revisiting them on occasions of marriages or family concerns.\n\nUntil 1881, no census of the population had been taken; an\nenumeration in that year gave the following results. The area of the State was 37,000 square miles. Population, 1,750,403; number of towns and villages, 3785; number of houses, 386,707. Density of population, 47'31 persons per square mile; houses per square mile, 10'45; persons per house, 4'53. There are ten villages on an average to every hundred miles of country. The religious division of the people shows \u2014 Hindus, 1,421,891; Muhammadans, 155,802; Jains, 172,404; Christians, 207; and 'others,' 99.\n\nIn the sandy portion of Jodhpur, and throughout Mall\u00e1ni, the houses are mostly beehive-shaped huts, with the exception of the Th\u00e1kur's residence, which in small villages is generally of mud, with a thatch roof. The villages are enclosed with a strong fence to keep out wild animals and thieves. The middle classes dwell in houses constructed of mud, with thatch roofs; those of the mah\u00e1jans (traders) are frequently of stone and mortar, whilst in some villages the Th\u00e1kur's house is a handsome well-constructed residence. The lower classes are generally temperate, laborious, and economical; their dress is of the most simple kind; as a rule, they partake of two meals a day, consisting of bread, dried vegetables, and curds and milk. Their houses usually contain nothing but a few cooking utensils and sleeping cots; carpets and rugs are rarely used, the people sitting on the bare ground. The majority of the cultivators are J\u00e1ts, Sirwis, Bishn\u00e1wis, Pit\u00e1ls, R\u00e1jputs, and Muhammadans of the country, such as K\u00e1im Kh\u00e1nis, who enjoy grants of land.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The principal rain crops are pulses and millets\u2014b\u00e1jra, jo\u00e1r, and moth. In the fertile portion of the State enclosed within the branches of the L\u00fani, wheat and barley are produced in considerable quantities. The most fertile districts of Jodhpur are Godw\u00e1r, Sojat, Jet\u00e1ran, and M\u00e1roth. In these districts wells abound, and spring and autumn crops are grown. Cotton is occasionally seen near wells, but the staple is poor. Opium is cultivated in the south-east portion of the State, in the vicinity of the Aravalli range of hills, where the water is sweet and the soil rich. Tobacco and sugar-cane are also grown, but not extensively.\n\nThe soils of Jodhpur have been classified under the following heads:\u2014B\u00e1ikal, the most prevalent, is a light sand, having little or no earthy admixture, and only fit for the production of b\u00e1jra, moth, t\u00ecl (sesamum), water-melons, and other cucurbitaceous plants; chikna, a clayey fat black earth, producing chiefly wheat; pila, a yellow sandy clay adapted for barley, tobacco, onions, and vegetables; safed\u00ed (white), a soil of siliceous nature, only productive after heavy rains; khari, alkaline earth, poisonous to all vegetation. In the sandy parts of the State, the rain sinks into the soil, and does not flow off the surface, so that a very small rainfall suffices for the crops. When the\nrainy season commences, the sandhills are ploughed by camels, and the seed planted very deep in the ground. After it has sprouted, a few showers at long intervals bring it to maturity; and as the light-built desert camels are quick movers, each householder is able to put a large extent of ground under crop. The produce in a favourable season is more than sufficient for the wants of the population, but, unfortunately, the means of storing grain are difficult to be got, as burnt earthen vessels for the purpose have to be brought from long distances. The surplus produce is therefore frequently left on the ground as fodder for the cattle. Irrigation works are rare; but care is taken to make the best use of the scanty rainfall by embanking the fields, so that the water is retained for two or three months, until the soil becomes sufficiently saturated to produce crops of wheat. Irrigation is also carried on by Persian wheels and ordinary wells where the water is not more than 75 feet in depth; beyond that depth, well irrigation is not remunerative. No uniform system of assessment of land revenue exists in M\u00e1rw\u00e1r; it varies in different localities, but one-third of the actual produce is the prevailing rate. In Nagar, the land yields a single luxuriant rain crop, of which the extreme share of one-half falls to the landlord. In the thal, or sandy portions of the State, where labour is scarce, and the ground yields poor and uncertain returns, the landlord\u2019s share sometimes falls as low as one-fourteenth.\n\nThe manufactures of Jodhpur are of no great importance in a commercial point of view. Turbans and scarves, and embroidered silk knotted thread for wearing on the turban, are specialities of the country. Leather boxes for holding clothes and brass utensils are also manufactured. Snuff is made in Jodhpur city. The principal exports of the State are salt, cattle, sheep, goats, horses, cotton, wool, dyed cloth, hides, and pomegranates. From Makr\u00e1n\u00e1, marble and marble manufactures are exported, and stone from various quarries. Stone flour-mills are constructed at Barmer in Mall\u00e1ni, and exported in large numbers. The chief imports are g\u00far and kand (coarse and refined sugar), and rice from Bhiw\u00e1ni in Hissar, opium from Kotah, Udaipur (Oodeypore), and Be\u00e1war. From Bombay come English piece-goods, silver and copper; from Gujar\u00e1t, spices of every kind, dates, gum-arabic, borax, cocoa-nuts, silk, sandal-wood, and dyes. Corn is imported from Sind and Bhiw\u00e1ni. Trade is carried on chiefly by permanent markets at Jodhpur city, P\u00e1li, Merta, Parbatsar, Nagar, Didw\u00e1n\u00e1, Pachpadra, Phalodi, Jalor, Pipar, and Balotra, the chief towns. In ordinary years, the local crops suffice for local wants, but the local manufactures do not.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The prevailing diseases are malarious or paroxysmal fevers, especially in the autumnal season, when the extremes of temperature are first experienced. Skin affections are also very\nprevalent, probably caused by the bad water and indifferent food of the lower classes, and partly by their dirty habits, the latter being in some degree the result of a scarcity of water for household use. The food of the people, consisting chiefly of bajra (Holcus spicatus), is also instrumental in the production of dyspeptic complaints, which would be even more prevalent, were it not for the abundance and cheapness of salt throughout the country. Guinea-worm and mycetoma or Madura-foot are also diseases of the soil. Of epidemic maladies, small-pox occurs periodically with some violence. Cholera, however, comparatively seldom presents itself, and still more rarely penetrates the semi-desert districts to the west of the city of Jodhpur.\n\nHistory. \u2014 The present ruling chief of Jodhpur is His Highness the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Jaswant Singh, who holds that position as chief of the Rahtor clan of R\u00e1jputs, to whom the territory belongs. The princes of Jodhpur, like their rivals of Udaipur (Oodeypore), term themselves Surya Vansa, or the \u2018Solar Race,\u2019 and claim descent from R\u00e1ma. The founder of the dynasty migrated from Kanauj; and the Rahtor race, from its warlike and aggressive propensities, became the most powerful clan of the R\u00e1jputs. Several independent States were founded by offshoots from it, among which are the present States of Bikaner (Bickaneer) and Kishengarh in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, and Edar and Ahmednagar in Gujar\u00e1t. It is probable that the J\u00e1ts, the M\u00ednas, and the Bhils originally held the country of M\u00e1rv\u00e1r in separate petty chiefships before the Rahtor conquest. The local historians relate that subsequently to the fall of the Rahtor dynasty of Kanauj in 1194 A.D., Sivaji, the grandson of Jai Ch\u00e1nda, the last king of Kanauj, entered M\u00e1rv\u00e1r on a pilgrimage to Dwarka, and, halting at the town of P\u00e1li, he and his followers displayed their valour by repelling large bands of marauders. At the entreaty of the Br\u00e1hman community of the place, who were greatly harassed by constant raids of plundering bands, Sivaji agreed to settle among them and become their protector. The Rahtor chief, acquiring land and power around P\u00e1li, gained there the first footing in the future kingdom. His son and successor, Asthan, extended the domain by conquering the land of Kher from the Gohel R\u00e1jputs, and established his brother Soning in Edar, then a small principality on the frontier of Gujar\u00e1t. It was not, however, till the time of R\u00e1o Ch\u00e1nda, the tenth in succession from Sivaji, that Mandor, then the capital of M\u00e1rv\u00e1r, was acquired by the Rahtors. From the time of Ch\u00e1nda, about 1382, the actual conquest of M\u00e1rv\u00e1r by the Rahtors may be dated. Ch\u00e1nda was succeeded by R\u00e1o Rir Mall, a famous warrior. His son Jodha ruled after him, and founded the city of Jodhpur, which he made his capital. In 1528, the Rahtors fought under the standard of Ud\u00e1ipur (Oodeypore) against the Mughal Emperor B\u00e1bar, on the field of Khanua. In 1544, the Afgh\u00e1n Sher Sh\u00e1h led an army of 80,000 men into\nM\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and obtained victory, but only after a narrow escape from defeat.\n\nIn 1561, the Emperor Akbar invaded the country, and eventually the chief of Jodhpur succumbed to necessity, and, as was the custom of the time, sent his son as a mark of homage to take service under the Mughal Emperor. When this son, Udai Singh, succeeded to the chiefship, he gave his sister Jodhb\u00e1i in marriage to Akbar, and was rewarded by the restoration of the former possessions of his house in M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, with the exception of Ajmere; and several rich districts in M\u00e1lw\u00e1 were added. The son of Udai Singh, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sur Singh, attained to high honour with Akbar, for whom he conquered Gujar\u00e1t and the Deccan. On the occasion of the contests among the four sons of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, Jaswant Singh, successor to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sur, was appointed to the command of the army sent against Aurangzeb. He was, however, defeated; and though he made peace with Aurangzeb afterwards, he was never forgiven. Aurangzeb, to get rid of him, appointed him to lead an army against the Afgh\u00e1ns. Jaswant Singh died beyond the Indus, leaving a posthumous son, Ajit Singh. During the infancy of the latter, Aurangzeb invaded M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, plundered Jodhpur, sacked all the large towns, and commanded the conversion of the Rahtor race to Muhammadanism. This cemented into a bond of union all who cherished either patriotism or religion; and the R\u00e1jputs, making common cause, held their own against the Muhammadan power. Ajit Singh was a party to the triple alliance with Udaipur and Jaipur to throw off the Muhammadan yoke. One of the conditions of this alliance was, that the chiefs of Jaipur and Jodhpur should regain the privilege of marriage with the Udaipur family, which they had forfeited by contracting alliances with the Mughal Emperors, on the understanding that the offspring of the princesses of Udaipur should succeed to the State in preference to all other children. Ajit Singh was murdered by his son Bakht Singh; but the quarrels arising from the stipulation in the above treaty lasted through generations, and led to the invitation of the help of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 leaders by the aspirants to power in support of their claims, and finally to the subjection of all the R\u00e1jput States to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 court of Poona.\n\nJodhpur was conquered by Sindhia, who levied a tribute of 6-lakhis of rupees (\u00a360,000), and took from it the fort and city of Ajmere. At the commencement of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 war of 1803, M\u00e1n Singh had just been elected by the nobles to be chief of Jodhpur, after a long struggle with his cousin Bhim Singh. The alliance of the British Government was offered to him, and a treaty drawn up, but not ratified; and M\u00e1n Singh, having meanwhile given assistance to Holkar, the treaty was formally cancelled in 1804, and M\u00e1n Singh left to his own resources. Thereafter, troubles came quickly upon Jodhpur, owing\nto internal disputes regarding the succession of Dhokal Singh, a reputed son of Bhim Singh, and a disastrous war with Jaipur for the hand of the daughter of the R\u00e1na of Udaipur. The aid of the great Pind\u00e1ri freebooter, Amir Kh\u00e1n, was called in first by the Jaipur and afterwards by the Jodhpur R\u00e1ja. Amir Kh\u00e1n thus became the arbiter of affairs in M\u00e1rw\u00e1r; and after terrifying the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 into abdication and pretended insanity, ended by plundering the treasury and leaving the country with its resources completely exhausted. Chhatar Singh, the only son of the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1, assumed the regency on the withdrawal of Amir Kh\u00e1n in 1817. With him the British Government commenced negotiations at the outbreak of the Pind\u00e1ri war; and a treaty was concluded in January 1818, by which Jodhpur was taken under the protection of the British Government, the tribute payable to Sindhia was transferred to the British, and the R\u00e1ja engaged to furnish a contingent of 1500 horse when required, and the whole forces of the State when necessary. Chhatar Singh died shortly after the conclusion of the treaty, whereupon his father threw off the mask of insanity, and resumed the administration. In 1824, 21 villages in Merw\u00e1r\u00e1 were made over temporarily to the British Government, with a view of bringing the lawless M\u00ednas and Mers into submission. The lease expired in 1843, but the R\u00e1ja expressed his readiness to leave the villages under British administration. No definite arrangement was made, and the tract is still being administered on this footing. The desert tract of Mall\u00e1ni has also been under the superintendence of the Political Agent since 1836. It belongs to Jodhpur; but the feudatories acknowledge the R\u00e1ja\u2019s supremacy merely by paying an annual tribute of \u00a3688, which is collected by the Political Agent, and paid over to the Jodhpur Government.\n\nThe misgovernment of M\u00e1n Singh, and the consequent disaffection and insurrection in the State, reached such a pitch that in 1839 the British Government was compelled to interfere. A force was marched to Jodhpur, of which it held military occupation for five months, and M\u00e1n Singh executed an engagement to ensure future good government. Four years after this, M\u00e1n Singh died, without sons of his body, and without adopting an heir. The succession lay between the chiefs of Edar and Ahmednagar, the chief of Edar being the nearest of kin (see Edar). It was left to the widows, the nobles, and the State officials interested to select the future ruler. Their choice fell upon Takht Singh, chief of Ahmednagar, a direct descendant of R\u00e1ja Aj\u00edt Singh, whom with his son Jaswant Singh they invited to Jodhpur. Owing to constant disputes between the Darb\u00e1r (official administration) and the Th\u00e1kurs (feudatory chiefs), the affairs of Jodhpur remained in an unsatisfactory state during the administration of R\u00e1ja Takht Singh, but he was loyal to the British Government, and did good service during the Mutiny.\nHe died in February 1873, and was succeeded by his son Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Jaswant Singh, the present ruler, who was born about 1837. He has received the right of adoption, and has been created a G.C.S.I.\n\nThe constitution of Jodhpur has been hitherto generally spoken of as feudal, but it may be more accurately described as a tribal suzerainty rapidly passing into the feudal stage. The institutions of the State are highly favourable to general peace and the protection of personal property, provided that the tribal chiefs live in harmony with their suzerain, and with one another, for there is a chain of authority running from the ruler to the possessor of a circle of 100 villages and of 1 village. The rights of all classes of the agricultural community are well defined, and thoroughly respected, except in periods of anarchy and misrule. Not only is the village community in its full sense intact in Jodhpur, but there is also a community of villages and of interdependent relations between them and their inhabitants. The patt\u00e1it or tribal chief of any magnitude is the ruler of his estate, and the judge almost exclusively in all matters of civil and criminal jurisdiction over his people. The Th\u00e1kurs of Jodhpur owe military service to their suzerain, and exact the same from their brethren to whom assignments of land have been made, and who form their following,\u2014the whole constituting the following of the suzerain himself. The fiscal lands are managed by h\u00e1kims or sub-divisional governors; but these hardly amount to one-fifth of the area in the possession of the Th\u00e1kurs and j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs. The right of Government to a certain money rate or share of the produce is well understood, and the agricultural classes everywhere live in comparative security.\n\nThere are various kinds of tenure in the State. Most tenures are ancestral and hereditary, having been obtained at different times by the relatives of the reigning family. The holders of these tenures pay military cess and succession-tax. The Th\u00e1kurs of the separate district of Mall\u00e1n\u00ed pay tribute only, but although nearly independent, cherish extreme loyalty to the head of the State. The rekh, or military cess, is believed to be about 8 per cent. of the gross rental of the th\u00e1kurate, or estate. Village tenures are numerous, the principal being known as b\u00e1pi (= fatherland), mangli, h\u00e1sili, s\u00e1san, pasaita, j\u00e1giri, and bh\u00fam. B\u00e1pi tenures are those granted in consideration of improvements effected by the tenants; mangli are b\u00e1pi lands held by Br\u00e1hmans; h\u00e1sili are lands ordinarily assessed by the State or a j\u00e1gird\u00e1r; s\u00e1san lands are those granted for religious purposes; pasaita are lands given rent free by the j\u00e1gird\u00e1r, and are resumable at will; j\u00e1giri lands are the untaxed lands of the j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs; and bh\u00fam lands are lands granted for State service, or upon reclamation by private enterprise. Bh\u00fam lands are tax free, hereditary, and only resumable by the State for treason or serious crime.\nAdministration.\u2014At Jodhpur city there are civil and criminal courts presided over by separate officials. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 alone has power of life and death, and final appeals lie to him in all but petty cases. Most of the district cases are disposed of by the h\u00e1kims. The Th\u00e1kurs within their estates assume independent magisterial authority; and until lately, it was only the lower feudatories who would surrender criminals or brook interference in criminal cases. Arbitration is generally resorted to in all civil disputes. The ceremonies of the Court are intricate and curious. The highest honour the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 bestows on a visitor is to receive and dismiss him standing, and raise his right hand a little in salutation on his arrival and departure; to the next in rank the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 rises both on arrival and departure; there is a third grade of visitors, on the arrival (not departure) of whom the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 rises. All the aristocracy of Jodhpur precede the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 in processions; if the chief stops to address any one, it is a token of particular honour. The great drum beats four times every night in the fort at Jodhpur, and it is a special sign of respect for a deceased Th\u00e1kur to omit one of the beats. On the death of a considerable Th\u00e1kur the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 pays a visit of condolence at the home of the Th\u00e1kur\u2019s family.\n\nThere is one large newly-constructed jail at Jodhpur city, to which, as a rule, all prisoners sentenced to more than three months\u2019 imprisonment are sent. At the head-quarters of each district there is a lock-up. Police duties are generally conducted by the army, no separate establishment existing. There are three dispensaries in the city of Jodhpur, besides one at the town of P\u00e1li, one at Nagar, and one at J\u00e1sol in Mall\u00e1n\u00ed. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 is very liberal in responding to any call for these charitable institutions. Education in an advanced form is unknown in Jodhpur. A large proportion of the population can read and write Hindi; amongst whom are included most of the ladies of good birth, a condition of things almost peculiar to this State. The capital now possesses two good schools, one for the sons of Th\u00e1kurs and the higher classes, the other for the children of trades-people and the lower classes. At both these schools, English is taught, as well as the vernacular languages. There are also schools supported by the State in some of the towns, and every large village possesses one, presided over by the local Jain priest. The language spoken in Jodhpur is a peculiar patois called M\u00e1rv\u00e1ri, considered to have an affinity to Hindi.\n\nThere is one metalled road, 100 miles in length, running through Jodhpur; it is the main route from Ajmere to Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d in Bombay. The R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 State Railway, on the metre gauge, from Ajmere, connecting with the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, skirts the south-eastern border of Jodhpur. This railway also touches the territory by the small northern branch line to the\nSambhar Salt Lake, which is on the boundaries of Jodhpur and Jaipur. From Karchi station (now called Jodhpur Junction, 87 miles southwest of Ajmere) of the Rajputana-Malwa State Railway, a short line of $64\\frac{1}{2}$ miles is under construction, at the expense of the State, to the town of Jodhpur, of which $43\\frac{1}{2}$ miles were open in 1884. Fairs are held in March, at Tilwara, lasting 15 days; at Mundwa in December, when from 30,000 to 40,000 people assemble; at Parbatsar in August, attended chiefly by Jats, who come to trade in bullocks; and at Bilara and Barkhana.\n\nThe revenue of the State is mainly derived from the land, salt, and custom dues, a cess imposed on the feudatory nobles, succession dues, etc. The total receipts may be calculated at about 40 lakh rupees (say \u00a3400,000). The numerous nobles of Marwar enjoy very large incomes, and there are also a great number of religious and other free grants, which amount probably altogether to more than double the revenue receipts.\n\nIn the treaty of 1818, it was stipulated that the tribute hitherto paid to Sindhiya by the Jodhpur State should be paid in perpetuity to the British Government. This tribute amounted to Rs. 108,000 (\u00a310,800), but has been reduced to Rs. 98,000 (say \u00a39800), Rs. 10,000 (\u00a31000) having been remitted as compensation for the fort of Umarkot in Sind. In the same treaty, it was agreed that the Jodhpur State should furnish a contingent of 15,000 horse when required. In 1832, a demand was made for a force to co-operate against freebooters who occupied Nagar Palkar. The contingent failed in its duty, and proved utterly useless. In 1835, therefore, the obligation to furnish the force was commuted to an annual payment of \u00a311,500 towards the Jodhpur Legion which was then raised. This Legion mutinied in 1857. Its place is now supplied by the Erinpura Irregular Force. The military establishment of the State, in addition to the Erinpura Force, consists of 55 field and 125 other guns, more than half being unserviceable, 320 gunners, 3499 cavalry, and 5954 infantry.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate of Jodhpur at all seasons may be described as dry. This dryness is due to the geographical position of the State, the geological nature of the surface, and the absence of forest. The Aravalli range separates the State from the more fertile districts of Udaipur. The country is therefore beyond the range of the full force of the south-west monsoon from the Indian Ocean, and entirely removed from the influence of the south-east monsoon from the Bay of Bengal. Also the clouds from the south-west, before arriving at Jodhpur, must float above extensive arid Districts, as the sandy tracts of Northern Gujar\u00e1t, Cutch, the Rann, and the desert Districts of Umarkot and Palkar. This results in a very small rainfall, which at the centre of the country, i.e. the city of Jodhpur, does not often\nexceed the average of 14 inches. In 1881 the rainfall was unusually heavy, gauging over 22 inches at Jodhpur city. The Luni contains only scanty pools of water, and its tributaries are dry during the greater part of the year. The sandy soil, the brackish water nearly everywhere found, and the prevalence of the saline efflorescence known as reh, are the principal reasons why there is so little of either wild jungle growth or of cultivated ground. Thus all conditions unite in producing that extraordinary dryness characteristic of Marwar. The next most striking peculiarity of the climate is the extreme variation of temperature which occurs in the cold season between the night and the day. This depends in a great degree on the dryness of the atmosphere, the heat given off by the earth at night passing freely through dry air, whereas it is absorbed and retained by the damp of a moist atmosphere. Thus it happens that on the sandy soil of Jodhpur, while the nights may be sufficiently cold for ice to form, the days are often marked by a temperature of 90\u00b0 F. in the shade of a tent. Similarly, although hot winds prevail with great violence in the months of April, May, and June, the nights are fairly cool.\n\nJodhpur.\u2014Capital of the Native State of Jodhpur or Marwar, Rajputana. Lat. 26\u00b0 17' N., long. 73\u00b0 4' E. It was built by Rao Jodha in 1459 A.D., and from that time has been the seat of Government of the principality. It is placed in the southern slope of a small range of hills running east and west, the prevailing geological formation of which is red sandstone. The fort commanding the city is built on a sandstone rock rising to the height of 800 feet, having to the north cones of porphyry and masses of trap of various descriptions placed in juxtaposition to the sandstone. The layers of this sandstone are usually parallel with the horizon, and they generally rise abruptly out of the sand below, but are sometimes visibly supported by trap or metamorphic rock. In some places, porphyritic trap is ranged in stairs, and has apparently been thrown up at a later date than the sandstone, without having materially damaged the stratification of the latter. The city is surrounded by a strong wall nearly 6 miles in extent, and there are seventy gates, each bearing the name of the place to which it leads. The fort stands on an isolated rock, the highest point of the range, and contains the Maharaja's palace, a large and handsome building, completely covering the crest of the hill on which it stands, and overlooking the city, which lies several hundred feet below. The city contains many handsome buildings\u2014palaces of the Maharaja, and town residences of the Thakurs or nobles, besides numerous fine temples and tanks. Building stone is plentiful, and close at hand, and the architecture solid and handsome. Three miles north from Jodhpur are the ruins of Mandor, interesting from having been the site of the ancient capital of the Purihar Princes of Marwar, prior to its\nconquest by the Rahtors. Mandor contains the cenotaphs of the ruling chiefs of the country, erected on the spot where the funeral pyre consumed the remains of those who in former days were seldom burned alone. There are also stone effigies of gallant chieftains of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, curious as specimens of rude carving by workmen of the country. No statistics of population, etc. have been supplied by the State authorities for the town of Jodhpur.\n\n**Jogeshwari.**\u2014Name of a celebrated cave in Amboli village, S\u00e1lsette island, Th\u00e1n\u00e1 District, Bombay Presidency. The cave is 2\u00bd miles southeast of Gurga\u00f3n station, on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway. It forms a temple of Brahma, and next to the Kail\u00e1s at Ellora is the largest known cave in India. Its length is 240 and breadth 200 feet. This cave temple contains rock-cut passages, an immense central hall supported by pillars, porticoes, and subsidiary courts. The temple dates from the eighth century.\n\n**Jogigarh.**\u2014Fort in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Central Provinces; situated on a small island in the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda) river. Lat. 22\u00b0 25' N., long. 76\u00b0 51' E. A rapid at this point renders navigation impracticable except during the rains, when a passage can be effected by small boats.\n\n**Jogi-ghop\u00e1.**\u2014Village in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Assam; on the right or north bank of the Brahmaputra, a few miles below the town of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1. In old days, before the conquest of Assam by the British, it possessed considerable importance as a centre of frontier trade. It contains the temple of Dudhn\u00e1th, sacred to Siva, which is frequented by Hindu pilgrims from distant parts of India; and in the neighbourhood are many artificial caverns, cut in the rocky face of the hills, which are believed to have been occupied in former times by religious devotees. Jogi-ghop\u00e1 was at one time the head-quarters of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District. The Bijni R\u00e1j\u00e1 has built a handsome residence here, and the place promises to increase in importance.\n\n**Jogi-maradi.**\u2014Highest peak in a broken mountain range that crosses Chitaldr\u00fag District, Mysore State; 3803 feet above sea-level.\n\n**Joll\u00e1rpet (Jol\u00e1rampetti, Jal\u00e1rapet).**\u2014Town in Tirupat\u00far t\u00e1luk, Salem District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 12\u00b0 34' N., long. 78\u00b0 38' E.; 1320 feet above sea-level. Contains 142 houses, with (1881) 694 inhabitants, of whom one-half are Pariah. A zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri village, important only as a first-class station of the Madras Railway, southwest line, and junction for Bangalore. Five miles from Tirupat\u00far, the head-quarters of the t\u00e1luk.\n\n**Jom\u00e1-male.**\u2014Mountain in Coorg.\u2014See Soma-male.\n\n**Jorh\u00e1t.**\u2014Sub-division of Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r District, Assam; formed in 1869. Population (1881) 143,985, distributed among 24 mauz\u00e1s or unions of\nvillages. Total revenue in 1881-82, \u00a323,821. The sub-divisional police force consists of 39 men stationed at the three th\u00e1n\u00e1s of Jorh\u00e1t, Kamal\u00e1b\u00e1ri, and Salang, and an outpost of frontier police at Debr\u00e1p\u00e1r. The superior administrative staff usually includes an Assistant and an extra-Assistant Commissioner. The tea-gardens numbered 95 in 1881.\n\n**Jorh\u00e1t.**\u2014Village in Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r District, Assam, and head-quarters of the Jorh\u00e1t Sub-division; lying in lat. 26\u00b0 46' N., and long. 94\u00b0 16' E., on the east or west bank of the Disoi river, about 12 miles south of Kokil\u00e1mukh on the Brahmaputra. Population (1881) 1984. Situated amid valuable tea-gardens, and at the centre of a system of roads, Jorh\u00e1t has become the most important mart in the District, though the Disoi can scarcely be called a navigable river. In 1865, out of a total of 160 shops in the b\u00e1z\u00e1r, 28 were occupied by M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri or Jain traders from the north-west, who import cotton goods, salt, and hardware from Bengal, in return for which they export silk, cotton, mustard seed, and jungle products. A few shops are kept by native Muhammadans, who chiefly sell 'Europe' goods and furniture; the remainder are petty stalls for retailing rice, oil, and vegetables. Many of the tea-gardens consign their produce by river steamer direct to England. The Jorh\u00e1t Tea Company is chiefly owned by shareholders in that country. The public buildings include a lock-up, a charitable dispensary, and a Government High School, which teaches as far as the University entrance examination. There is also an artisans' school, supported out of a bequest from a European tea-planter of the District. Jorh\u00e1t was erected into a municipal union in October 1881. At the close of the last century, the place was at various times the residence of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Gaurin\u00e1th, the last of the independent kings of the Aham dynasty.\n\n**Joriya.**\u2014See JODHIA.\n\n**Joshimath.**\u2014Village in Garhw\u00e1l District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 30\u00b0 33' 25\" N., and long. 79\u00b0 36' 35\" E., at the confluence of the Alaknand\u00e1 and the Dhaul\u00ed. Chiefly remarkable as the winter residence of the R\u00e1wal, or priest of the temple of Badrinath, who retires hither after the snows have rendered the higher shrine inaccessible. The village contains several ancient temples. Elevation above sea-level, 6200 feet.\n\n**Jotd\u00e1r.**\u2014Channel of the Devi, or branch of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed estuary, in the south-east of Cuttack District, Bengal. Enters the sea in lat. 20\u00b0 11' N., and long. 86\u00b0 34' E.\n\n**Joura.**\u2014State in Central India Agency.\u2014See JAORA.\n\n**Jow\u00e1i.**\u2014Village and administrative head-quarters of the Jaintia Hills Sub-division, Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills District, Assam; 4422 feet above sea-level. Population (1881) 3229. Jow\u00e1i is the residence of the Assistant Deputy Commissioner; and, as the centre of a system of hill roads, it\npossesses a considerable trade. The chief exports are raw cotton and caoutchouc; the imports\u2014rice, dried fish, cotton goods, and salt. The average annual rainfall for the five years ending December 1881 was 362.63 inches. Jow\u00e1i was the centre of the Jaintia rebellion in 1862.\n\nJu\u00e1ngs, The.\u2014One of the most primitive tribes of the Orissa Tributary States (q.v.). Their principal habitat is in Keunjhar State, where they numbered 4592 in 1872, and Dhenkanal State, where they numbered 4120. There were also 367 of this tribe returned in Pal Lahara State in 1872, with 290 in Hindol, and 290 in Banki. Total, 9398 within the Tributary States in 1872. Owing to changes in classification, the Census of 1881 fails to disclose the number of this tribe, and includes the Ju\u00e1ngs among the Hindu low-castes. Colonel Dalton was informed that there were 32 settlements of the Ju\u00e1ng tribe in Keunjhar, occupying the hill country southward from Keunjhar fort to Handah; between 21\u00b0 20' and 21\u00b0 40' N. lat., and between 85\u00b0 30' and 85\u00b0 45' E. long.\n\nIn this tract, as in their other settlements, the Ju\u00e1ng hamlets are mingled with Bhuiy\u00e1 and Go\u00e1l\u00e1 villages. The following description is slightly condensed from Colonel Dalton's Ethnology of Bengal (pp. 152-158, Government Press, Calcutta 1872). The Ju\u00e1ngs appear to have been driven back by the Bhuiy\u00e1s from the fertile valleys, and their cultivation is now chiefly found upon the hill-sides. They have no traditions which affiliate them with any other race; and notwithstanding a similarity in their languages, they repudiate all connection with Hos or Sant\u00e1ls. They aver very positively that they are autochthones in Keunjhar, the direct descendants of the first human beings that appeared or were produced in that country, or indeed in the world. For they assert a claim to be the first produced of the human race, though they make no pretensions to be the fathers of mankind. The head-quarters of the tribe, or cradle of the race, they consider to have been at Gon\u00e1sik\u00e1, in 21\u00b0 30' N. lat., and 85\u00b0 37' E. long., where a stream which is the source of the Baitaran\u00ed issues from two holes in a rock, supposed to bear a resemblance to the nostrils of a cow. They assert that the Baitaran\u00ed, on whose banks they were created, is older than the Ganges; and that the present Ju\u00e1ng inhabitants of the village of Gon\u00e1sik\u00e1, and other villages in the vicinity, occupy the very soil from which the parents of their race were produced. They have no traditions to record, except that very long ago nine hundred Ju\u00e1ngs left the country of their birth and moved to Dhenk\u00e1nal, and that then the Bhuiy\u00e1s came and took up the land of the brethren who had left them; but it is more probable that they were driven out by the Bhuiy\u00e1s, who are now the dominant race in those hills. The Bhuiy\u00e1s, however, deny this, asserting that they are the true autochthones, and that the Ju\u00e1ngs are interlopers. There is a tradition of a Bor\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1 (probably some allusion to\nthe Bar\u00e1ha avat\u00e1r; or Boar Incarnation of Vishnu) having had a fort in the heart of the country now occupied by Ju\u00e1ngs, the remains of which are still in existence; and it is said that the Ju\u00e1ngs are the remnant of his people.\n\nIn Habits and Customs the Ju\u00e1ngs are most primitive. They occupy a hill country in which stone implements, the earliest specimens of human ingenuity that we possess, are occasionally found; and though they have now abandoned the use of such implements, and have lost the art of making them, it is not improbable that they are the direct descendants of those ancient stone-cutters, and that we have in the Ju\u00e1ngs representatives of the stone age in situ. Until foreigners came amongst them, they must have used such weapons, or none at all, for they had no knowledge whatever of metals. They had no ironsmiths nor smelters of iron. They have no word in their own language for iron or other metals. They neither spin nor weave, nor have they ever attained to the simplest knowledge of pottery. In the hills of Keunjhar they are still semi-nomadic in their habits, living together in villages during a portion of the year, but often changing the sites, and occupying isolated huts in the midst of their patches of cultivation, whilst the crops are on the ground.\n\nDwellings.\u2014Gon\u00e1sik\u00e1, one of the largest of their villages, contains about twenty-five houses of Ju\u00e1ngs. The huts are amongst the smallest that human beings ever deliberately constructed as dwellings. They measure about six feet by eight, and are very low, with doors so small as to preclude the idea of a corpulent householder. Scanty as are the above dimensions for a family dwelling, the interior is divided into two compartments, one of which is the storeroom, the other being used for all domestic arrangements. The head of the family and all his belongings of the female sex huddle together in this one stall, not much larger than a dog-kennel. For the boys there is a separate dormitory. This latter is a building of some pretensions, situated at the entrance of the village. It is constructed upon a solid platform of earth raised about four feet, and has two apartments. One of these is an inner and closed one, in which the musical instruments of the village are kept, and in which most of the boys sleep; the other is open on three sides,\u2014that is, it has no walls,\u2014but the eaves spread far beyond the platform, and the inmates are effectually protected. This is where all guests are lodged, and it makes a convenient travellers\u2019 rest.\n\nCultivation.\u2014The Ju\u00e1ngs cultivate in the rudest way, destroying the forest trees by the process of girdling them, burning all they can of the timber when it dries, and spreading the ashes over the land. They thus raise a little early rice, Indian corn, pulses, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, ginger, and red pepper, the seeds being all thrown into the ground at once, to come up as they can.\nFood.\u2014They declare that they subsist every year more on wild roots and fruits than on what they rear, but it is doubtful if they are so badly off as they pretend to be. The area of their cultivation appears proportionate to their numbers. They pay no rent, being under an obligation to render personal service to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, by repairing his house and carrying his burdens when required. They are addicted to ardent spirits, which they are obliged to buy, as they have not acquired the art of distilling, or even of brewing rice beer. In regard to food, they are not in the least particular, eating all kinds of flesh, including mice, rats, monkeys, tigers, bears, snakes, frogs, and even offal. The jungles abound in spontaneously-produced vegetables. In quest of such food, the Ju\u00e1ngs possess all the instinct of animals, discerning at a glance what is nutritive, and never mistaking a noxious for an edible fungus or root. Their favourite weapon is the primitive sling made of cord, with rough unfashioned stones or pebbles for missiles. They also use the bow and arrow.\n\nDress.\u2014Until recently, the only clothing of the Ju\u00e1ngs, particularly among the females, consisted of a few strings of beads, with a bunch of leaves before and behind. The Ju\u00e1ngs take young shoots of the \u00e1s\u00e1n (Terminalia tomentosa) or any tree with long, soft leaves, and arrange them so as to form a flat and scale-like surface of the required size; the sprigs are simply stuck in the girdle, and the costume is complete. The beads that form the girdle are small tubes of burnt earthenware made by the wearers. The women wear also a profusion of necklaces of glass beads, and of brass ornaments in their ears and on their wrists. The males were first induced to adopt a scanty cotton loin cloth for purposes of decency, but the women were long deterred by superstition from following their example. Several traditions exist to account for this, the simplest of which is connected with the origin of the Baitaran\u00ed. The river goddess, emerging for the first time from the Gon\u00e1sik\u00e1 rock, came suddenly on a merry party of Ju\u00e1ng females dancing naked; and ordering them to adopt a garment of leaves, laid on them the curse that they must adhere to the costume for ever or die. Some years ago, the British officer in charge of the kh\u00e9d\u00ed operations in Keunjhar induced a number of Ju\u00e1ng females to clothe themselves, he supplying the first robes. The Ju\u00e1ngs under British influence have now been clothed by order of Government; and their native chiefs in the Tributary States have been persuaded to do the same work for others. In 1871, the English officer called together the clan, and after a speech, handed out strips of cotton for the women to put on. They then passed in single file, to the number of 1900 before him, made obeisance, and were afterwards marked on the forehead with vermilion, as a sign of their entering into civilized society. Finally, they gathered the bunches of leaves which had formed their sole clothing into a great\nheap and solemnly set fire to it. It is reported, however, that a number of the Ju\u00e1ng women, their original garments wearing out, and finding that they were not to be renewed gratuitously, have again lapsed into their primitive leafy attire.\n\nThe predominating physical characteristics of the Ju\u00e1ngs are\u2014great lateral projection of the cheek bones, or zygomatic arches and general flatness of features; forehead upright, but narrow and low, and projecting over a very depressed nasal bone; nose of the pug species; alae spreading; mouth large, and lips very thick, but upper jaw rarely prognathous, though the lower jaw and chin are receding; hair coarse and frizzly; prevailing colour of a reddish brown. Some of them have oblique eyes of the Indo-Chinese type, but in this feature there is considerable variety. It is noticeable that the Ju\u00e1ng women tattoo their faces with the same marks that are used by the Mund\u00e1s, Kharri\u00e1s, and Ur\u00e1ons: namely, three strokes on the forehead just over the nose, and three on each of the temples. They attach no meanings to the marks, have no ceremony in adopting them, and are ignorant of their origin.\n\nThe Ju\u00e1ngs are a small race, like the Ur\u00e1ons, the males averaging less than five feet in height, the women not more than four feet eight inches.\n\nReligion.\u2014The Ju\u00e1ngs appear to be free from the belief in witchcraft, which is the bane of the Kols, and perniciously influences nearly all other classes in the Jungle Mah\u00e1ls and Tributary States. They have not, like the Kharri\u00e1s, the reputation of being deeply skilled in sorcery. Their language has no words for \u2018God,\u2019 for \u2018heaven\u2019 or \u2018hell;\u2019 and, so far as can be learned, they have no idea of a future state. They offer fowls to the sun when in distress, and to the earth to give them its fruits in due season. On these occasions an old man officiates as priest; he is called Nag\u00e1m. The even tenor of their lives is unbroken by any obligatory religious ceremonies.\n\nMarriages and Funeral Ceremonies.\u2014Marriage is recognised, but is brought about in the simplest manner. If a young man fancies a girl, he sends a party of his friends to propose for her; and if the offer is accepted, a day is fixed, and a load of rice in husk is presented on his behalf. The bridegroom does not go himself to the bride\u2019s house; his friends go, and return with her and her friends. Then they make merry, eating and dancing, and all stay and make a night of it. In the morning, the bridegroom dismisses the bride\u2019s friends with a present of three measures of husked and three of unhusked rice; and this is a full and sufficient solemnization. A man may have more wives than one if he can afford it, but no Ju\u00e1ng has ever ventured on more than two at a time. They are divided into tribes, and are exogamous. They burn their dead, and throw the ashes into any running stream; their mourning is an abstinence for three days from flesh and salt. They erect no monuments, and have no notion of the worship of ancestors.\nJ\u00fab\u00e1.\u2014Deserted fortress in Sarg\u00faj\u00e1 State, Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, Bengal; about 2 miles south-east of M\u00e1npura village. It stands on the rocky shoulder of a hill, and commands a deep gorge overgrown with jungle. Among the trees are the remains of carved temples, almost covered with accumulations of vegetable mould. Here Colonel Ousely found a complete linga, with a well-carved face and head projecting from its surface.\n\nJubbal (Jubal).\u2014One of the Hill States under the Government of the Punjab, situated between $30^\\circ 46'$ and $31^\\circ 4'$ N. lat., and between $77^\\circ 27'$ and $77^\\circ 50'$ E. long. Jubbal was originally tributary to Sirm\u00far (Sarmor), but after the Gurkh\u00e1 war it was made independent. The R\u00e1n\u00e1 misgoverned the State, and in 1832 abdicated in favour of the British Government. He very soon, however, repented the act, and refused the allowance of \u00a3440 a year which was made for his support. After a lengthy correspondence, it was resolved in 1840 to restore the State. In that year the R\u00e1n\u00e1 died, and Government approved the succession of his son, Tika Karm Ch\u00e1nd, who died in 1877 and was succeeded by his son, Padam Ch\u00e1nd, the present R\u00e1n\u00e1. The family is by caste Rahtor R\u00e1jput. The area of the State is 288 square miles. It contains 472 villages and a population (1881) of 19,196, namely, males 10,605, and females 8591. Hindus numbered 19,159, and Muhammadans 37. Estimated revenue, nearly \u00a34000. The chief products are grain and opium. Sentences of death passed by the R\u00e1n\u00e1 require the confirmation of the Superintendent of Hill States and of the Commissioner of the Division. Other punishments are awarded by the R\u00e1n\u00e1 on his own authority.\n\nJubbulpore.\u2014Division, District, tahs\u00edl, and city in the Central Provinces.\u2014See Jabalpur.\n\nJuggaur.\u2014Town and railway station in Lucknow District, Oudh; situated about three miles south of the Lucknow and Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) road. A Musalm\u00e1n village conquered from the Bhars by a family of Shaikhs, who colonized 52 villages in this part of the country, for which they received a farm\u00e1n confirming them in the proprietary right. Their descendants are still proprietors of Juggaur. Population (1881), Hindus, 1613; Muhammadans, 653; total, 2266.\n\nJuhar (Jawahir).\u2014Valley in Kuma\u00fan District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. $30^\\circ 10'$ to $30^\\circ 35'$ N., long. $79^\\circ 49'$ to $80^\\circ 19'$ E. One of the Bhuti\u00e1 mah\u00e1l\u00eds, or tracts on the northern Himalayan slopes inhabited by people of Tibetan origin. The population have, however, adopted the language, customs, and religion of their Hindu neighbours. They are chiefly engaged in commerce, being the only Bhuti\u00e1s who enjoy unrestricted intercourse with Gartoh, where a great annual fair is held in September. During the official year 1876-77, the value of the imports by Lilam from Juhar amounted to \u00a312,600, and that of the exports to \u00a34100.\nJu-i-Sharki.\u2014Town in R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli tahs\u00edl, R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli District, Oudh; situated 12 miles from Bareli town, at a distance of 2 miles from the Sai river. Population (1881) 2623, namely, Hindus, 2513, and Muhammadans, 110. Government school.\n\nJullundur.\u2014Division, District, tahs\u00edl, and city, Punjab.\u2014See Jalandhar.\n\nJummoo.\u2014Province and town in Kashmir State, Punjab.\u2014See Kashmir and Jammu.\n\nJumna (Jamund).\u2014A river of the North-Western Provinces and the Punjab. It rises in the Him\u00e1layas, in the Native State of Garhw\u00e1l, about 5 miles north of Jamnotri, and about 8 miles north-west of the lofty mountain Bandarp\u00e1nch (20,731 feet), in lat. 31\u00b0 3' N., and long. 78\u00b0 30' E. From this place the Jumna flows south for 7 miles, past Jamnotri, and then turns to the south-west for 32 miles, receiving on its right bank two small streams, the Badiar and the Kam\u00e1l\u00e1da; thence it runs due south for 26 miles, receiving the Badri and the Aslaur as tributaries. Just below the point of junction of the latter, the Jumna turns sharply to the west, and continues in this direction for 14 miles, till it is joined on its right bank by the great river Tons from the north, and at the same time it emerges from the Him\u00e1layas into the valley of the D\u00fan, in long. 77\u00b0 53' E. From this point it flows in a south-westerly direction for 22 miles, dividing the Kiarda D\u00fan on the west from the Dehra D\u00fan on the east; and it receives in this stretch two large affluents, the Giri from Sirm\u00far (Sarmor) on the west, and the Asan from the east.\n\nIn the 95th mile of its course, the Jumna leaves the Siw\u00e1lik Hills and enters the plains at Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d in Sah\u00e1ranpur District. It now flows for 65 miles in a south-south-west direction, dividing the Districts of Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umballa) and Karn\u00e1l in the Punjab from those of Sah\u00e1ranpur and Muzaffarnagar in the North-Western Provinces. By the time the Jumna debouches on the plains, it has become a large river, and near Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d it gives off both the Western and Eastern Jumna Canals (qq.v.). At R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t it receives the Maskarra stream from the east, but no other tributaries of any size join it in this section. Near Bidhauli, in Muzaffarnagar District, it turns due south, and runs in that direction for 80 miles till it reaches the city of Delhi; here it turns south-east for 27 miles to near Dankaur, when it again resumes its southerly course. In this portion it receives on the east the Kathanad\u00ed and the Hindan river, while on the west the Sabinad\u00ed joins it a little north of Delhi. The Jumna here separates the Punjab Districts of Karn\u00e1l and Delhi and the Native State of Ballabhgarh from the Districts of Muzaffarnagar, Meerut (Merath), and Bulandshahr, in the North-Western Provinces. From Dankaur to Mah\u00e1b\u00e1n, near Muttra (Mathur\u00e1), a distance of about 100 miles, the Jumna receives no affluents\nof any size; it divides the Punjab District of Gurg\u00e9on from the Districts of Bulandshahr and Al\u00edgarh in the North-Western Provinces, and near Hodal it enters the North-Western Provinces altogether. It flows through the centre of the District of Muttra till it leaves it near Mah\u00e1ban to enter the District of Agra. The Agra Canal forms a recent and an important work.\n\nFrom Mah\u00e1ban the Jumna turns eastwards and flows a little south by east for nearly 200 miles. In this part of its course the river winds in a remarkable manner through the ravines of Agra and Et\u00e1wah Districts; the bed of the stream is narrower, and the banks higher and steeper than in its upper reaches. It receives on its left or northern bank the Karwanad\u00ed near Agra, and on its right or southern the river Utangan. It passes the towns of Agra, Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Et\u00e1wah. From Et\u00e1wah the Jumna takes a more southerly direction, and flows south-east for 140 miles to Ham\u00edrpur. In this portion of its course the river passes through the southern tract of Et\u00e1wah, and then forms the boundary between Et\u00e1wah and Cawnpur Districts on the north, and Jal\u00e1un and Ham\u00edrpur Districts on the south. On its north bank the Jumna is joined by the Sengur a little below K\u00e1lp\u00ed; and on its south bank, by the great river Chambal from the west 40 miles below Et\u00e1wah, and by the Sind on the borders of Et\u00e1wah and Jal\u00e1un.\n\nFrom Ham\u00edrpur, till its junction with the Ganges at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, the Jumna flows nearly due east. It separates the Districts of Fatehpur and Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d on the north from that of B\u00e1n\u00e1da on the south, until it enters Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, and finally falls into the Ganges, in lat. 25\u00b0 25' N., and long. 81\u00b0 55' E., three miles below the city of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, the only important town which the Jumna passes during this last section of its course. Total length from its source, 860 miles. Its chief tributaries in this part of its course are the Betw\u00e1 and the Ken.\n\nThe Jumna, after issuing from the hills, has a longer course through the North-Western Provinces than the Ganges, but it is not so large or so important a river, and above Agra in the hot weather it dwindles to a small stream. This is no doubt partly caused by the two canals (the Eastern and Western Jumna Canals) taken off from it at Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, where it issues from the D\u00fan.\n\nThe trade on the Jumna is not now very considerable; in its upper portion, timber, and in the lower, stone, grain, and cotton are the chief articles of commerce, carried in the clumsy barges which navigate its waters. These have sails, and always take advantage of a favourable wind; at other times they float down with the current, or are slowly and laboriously tugged up against stream by long strings of boatmen. Its waters are clear and blue, while those of the Ganges are yellow and muddy; and at the point of junction below the fort of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d the difference between the streams can be discerned for some distance\nbelow the point at which they unite. Its banks are high and rugged, often attaining the proportions of cliffs, and the ravines which run into it are deeper and larger than those of the Ganges. It traverses in great part the extreme edge of the alluvial plain of Hindust\u00e1n, and in the latter part of its course almost touches the Bundelkhand offshoots of the Vindliya range of mountains. Its passage is therefore more tortuous, and the scenery along its banks is more varied and pleasing than that of the Ganges.\n\nThe Jumna at its source near Jamnotri is 10,849 feet above the sea-level; at Kotnur, 16 miles lower, it is only 5036 feet; so that, between these two places, it falls at the rate of 314 feet in a mile. At its junction with the Tons, it is 1686 feet above the sea; at its junction with the Asan, 1470 feet; and at the point where it issues from the Siw\u00e1lik Hills into the plains, it is 1276 feet. The catchment area of the Jumna is 118,000 square miles; its flood discharge at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, 1,333,000 cubic feet per second; discharge per square mile of catchment area, 11\u00b73 cubic feet per second.\n\nThe Jumna is now crossed by railway bridges at Delhi, Agra, and Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d; and there are bridges of boats at Et\u00e1wah, K\u00e1lpi, Hamirpur, Muttra, Chillat\u00e1ra, and other places.\n\n**Jumna (Jamun\u00e1) Canal, Eastern.**\u2014An important irrigation work in Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur, Muzaffarnagar, and Meerut (Merath) Districts, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 28\u00b0 38' to 30\u00b0 19' N., long. 77\u00b0 19' to 77\u00b0 38' E. It derives its supply from the left or eastern bank of the river Jumna, irrigates the western portion of the Upper Do\u00e1b, and eventually tails into the Junna (Jamun\u00e1) in Meerut District, after a course of 160 miles. The frequent recurrence of famines in this part of India, before the establishment of British rule, and for some years subsequently, caused attention to be directed at an early period of our occupation to the necessity for an extended system of canals. Owing to the pressure of other important measures, however, it was not till the close of 1823 that the actual work of excavation commenced, and the canal reached its completion in 1830. Being the first large irrigation scheme undertaken in India by our authorities, some changes in detail became necessary at a later period, but the work as a whole reflects the greatest credit upon its projectors. From the Jumna head-works to the 11th milestone, the bed consists of boulders or shingle, gradually decreasing in size; thenceforward to Sark\u00e1ri (26 miles), sand and clay predominate on the bottom, interspersed between Sark\u00e1ri and Jauli (123 miles) with nodular carbonate of lime, and merging below Jauli into pure sand.\n\nOn the sandy sections, erosion has been avoided by the construction of falls, also utilized as motive-power for flour-mills. Rows of s\u00e1l, sisu, teak, and t\u00fan trees fringe the bank, and their timber forms an important\nitem in the revenue. The total area irrigated by the Eastern Jumna Canal during the year 1875-76 amounted to 195,846 acres, of which 87,294 belonged to the kharif or autumn harvest, and 108,552 to the rabi or spring harvest. In 1880, the total area irrigated by the canal was 235,862 acres; and in 1882-83, 254,513 acres. Taking the average of five years ending 1881-82, the total area annually irrigated by the canal amounts to 245,933 acres, of which 140,807 acres belong to the kharif, and 141,126 to the rabi harvest, the average water-supply at Kalsia being 1116 cubic feet for the kharif, and 933 cubic feet for the rabi. The area irrigated for each cubic foot of supply was accordingly 93.89 acres in the former case, and 151.18 acres in the latter. The water was dispersed by means of main distributaries, having a total length of 618 miles. The following table shows the tariff in force in 1876:\n\n| Class | Nature of Crop | Per Acre irrigated by | Per |\n|-------|----------------|----------------------|-----|\n|       |                | Natural Flow | Lift | Year |\n| I.    | Sugar-cane     | 10 0          | 6 8  |      |\n| II.   | Rice, tobacco, opium, vegetables, gardens, or orchards | 6 0 | 4 0 | Crop |\n| III.  | All rabi crops, indigo, cotton | 4 6 | 3 0 | Crop |\n| IV.   | All kharif crops, or crops not above specified | 3 4 | 2 0 | Crop |\n\nBy 'flow' is understood water which reaches the fields from distributaries above their level; and by 'lift,' water which must be raised by means of buckets or otherwise to the level of the fields.\n\nThe canal opened in 1830 with a debit against its capital account of \u00a343,800. The following statement shows the financial position of the undertaking in 1875-76, and in 1881:\u2014Outlay during 1875-76, \u00a312,273; and \u00a347,000 in 1881.

From the opening of the canal up to the end of 1881, the total direct income has been \u00a31,450,472, and the total increased land revenue, \u00a3354,476; grand total, \u00a31,804,948. Total working expenses from opening to the end of 1881, \u00a3578,445, showing a profit of income over expenditure of \u00a31,226,503. According to the principle of calculating profit and loss officially adopted, the net revenue in 1875-76 shows a return of 15\u00b763 per cent. on capital, or including increased land revenue, a return of 35\u00b725 per cent. In 1881, the net revenue shows a return of 21\u00b72 per cent. on capital, or including increased land revenue, a return of 29\u00b75 per cent.\n\nThe following are the details of direct income for 1875-76:\u2014Water rates, \u00a354,649; mill rents, \u00a31145; canal plantations, \u00a32869; miscellaneous, \u00a3585; total actual receipts, \u00a359,248. The details of direct income for 1881 are as follow:\u2014Water rates, \u00a370,351; mill rents, \u00a31171; canal plantations, \u00a31681; miscellaneous, \u00a3715; total actual receipts, \u00a373,918.\n\n**Jumna (Jamuna) Canal, Western.**\u2014An important irrigation work in Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umballa), Karn\u00e1l, Delhi, Rohtak, and Hiss\u00e1r Districts, Punjab. Lat. 28\u00b0 54' to 30\u00b0 13' N., long. 76\u00b0 35' to 77\u00b0 26' E. It takes its supply of water from the Jumna at H\u00e1thni K\u00fand, on its western bank, at T\u00e1jaw\u00e1l\u00e1, about a mile and a half below the point where the river debouches from the Siw\u00e1l\u00edk hills. The head-works consist of a permanent weir across the river bed, with scouring and regulating sluices on both banks, those on the right bank feeding the Western, and those on the left the Eastern Jumna Canal. One-third of the Jumna river has already been carried off for the Eastern Jumna Canal, whose head stands 3\u00bd miles higher up the channel. Nearly the whole river at H\u00e1thni K\u00fand is diverted by artificial cuts and dams, first into the Budhi Jumna, and then into the Patr\u00e1la torrent. The latter shortly joins the Sombh, and just below their junction, at D\u00e1d\u00fapur, a dam crosses the united stream and turns the whole body of water into the canal. The canal diverges at an acute angle from the Sombh, and the water is admitted through a regulator on the western bank of that river. The dam is 777 feet in length, and consists of a series of masonry piers, 3 feet in thickness, with openings of 10 feet wide. When it is required to stop the water back into the canal, these openings are closed by boards; while by the removal of the boards, the whole water of the river can at any time be allowed to escape down the bed of the Sombh, and thence into the Jumna.\n\nThe first irrigation cut from the Jumna, of which record remains, was drawn about the middle of the 14th century by the Emperor F\u00edroz Sh\u00e1h Tughlak for the supply of his city of Hiss\u00e1r. The head-works probably coincided with those of the modern undertaking (although\nthe precise position cannot be determined), and the alignment followed one or other of the natural channels intersecting the Jumna lowlands as far as Karn\u00e1l. Thence a short excavation led into a line of drainage connected with the Chutang, whose bed may still be traced to its junction with the Ghaggar. The old canal appears to have terminated in a small masonry tank a little beyond Hiss\u00e1r; and the absence of distributaries or their remains along its course would seem to show that it was not employed for intermediate irrigation, but simply for the supply of the imperial grounds. Two hundred years later, the channel, which had silted up in the interim, was reopened by order of Akbar, about 1568. About the year 1628, Al\u00ed Mard\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, the famous engineer of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, took off a large branch for the purpose of bringing water to the new city of Delhi. This work must have been executed with considerable skill and at great cost. Another branch was at the same time carried in the direction of Rohtak.\n\nDuring the decline of the Mughal Empire, however, and the period of Sikh reaction, the canal gradually silted up once more, and, ceasing to flow about the middle of the 18th century, remained in disuse until after the introduction of British rule. In 1817, our Government undertook the restoration of the Delhi branch, and the water re-entered that city in 1820. The restoration of the Hiss\u00e1r branch followed in 1823\u201325, and during the succeeding year, irrigation commenced in Hiss\u00e1r District. The famine year of 1832\u201333, however, first roused the cultivators to a sense of its value. The total length of canal now open amounts to 433 miles, with an aggregate of 259 miles of distributing channels, besides private watercourses. From D\u00e1d\u00fapur to Karn\u00e1l (40 miles in a straight line), the canal takes a winding course through the lowlands, by an old bed, parallel in the main to the Jumna. Six miles below Karn\u00e1l it passes south-westward through the high outer bank of the river valley by a cutting. At Rer, 14 miles below, the Delhi branch strikes off due south, traverses Delhi city, and terminates in a junction with the river. The Rohtak branch leaves the main line 11 miles farther on, and, passing Rohtak, loses itself in a sandy tract south of that town. The But\u00e1na branch strikes off 3\u00bd miles below the Rohtak, and, dividing into two forks, ends after a course of 27 miles a little beyond But\u00e1na. The main line continues along F\u00edroz Sh\u00e1h\u2019s alignment, in a tortuous channel, till it meets the Chutang Nad\u00ed, whose bed it utilizes for the remainder of its course. Flowing south-westward as far as H\u00e1nsi, and then slightly northward to Hiss\u00e1r, it divides into two branches, one of them artificial, and finally ends in the sands beyond the British frontier. After very heavy seasons, a small quantity of water finds its way to the Ghaggar.\n\nThe following statement shows the area irrigated during the ten years ending 1873, and also during the six years from 1877\u201378 to 1882\u201383:\u2014\n1863-64, 351,537 acres; 1864-65, 434,964 acres; 1865-66, 397,963 acres; 1866-67, 447,171 acres; 1867-68, 331,937 acres; 1868-69, 486,878 acres; 1869-70, 496,542 acres; 1870-71, 472,404 acres; 1871-72, 444,385 acres; 1872-73, 351,820 acres. In 1877-78, the irrigated area was 507,974 acres; 1878-79, 398,460 acres; 1879-80, 310,680 acres; 1880-81, 265,551 acres; 1881-82, 300,545 acres; 1882-83, 374,243. Average for the six years ending 1882-83, 359,576 acres.\n\nThe total capital outlay of the British Government upon this canal up to the end of 1872-73, amounted to \u00a3311,693, and up to the end of 1882-83, \u00a3884,952. No data exist upon which an estimate of its original cost may be based. The canal, with its extensions now (1884) approaching completion, is intended to protect an area of 1640 square miles. The following table exhibits the financial state of the undertaking for fourteen years ending 1883-84:\n\n**Statement showing Area irrigated, Income, Working Expenses, and Profit on the Western Jumna Canal from 1870-71 to 1883-84.**\n\n| Year   | Gross Income | Working Expenses | Profit | Percentage upon Capital at the beginning of the Year | Area Irrigated in Acres |\n|--------|--------------|------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n|        | Direct       | Direct with Indirect | Direct | Direct with Indirect | Direct | Direct with Indirect |\n| 1870-71 | \u00a3150,757    | \u00a3188,013         | \u00a333,873 | \u00a3116,884 | \u00a3154,140 | 44\u00b746 | 58\u00b763 | 462,707 |\n| 1871-72 | \u00a3109,296    | \u00a3146,552         | \u00a337,645 | \u00a371,651 | \u00a3108,907 | 25\u00b766 | 39\u00b701 | 444,385 |\n| 1872-73 | \u00a3102,300    | \u00a3139,556         | \u00a340,118 | \u00a362,182 | \u00a399,438 | 20\u00b786 | 33\u00b736 | 351,821 |\n| 1873-74 | \u00a3100,328    | \u00a3137,585         | \u00a337,298 | \u00a363,030 | \u00a3100,287 | 22\u00b721 | 32\u00b717 | 311,747 |\n| 1874-75 | \u00a391,290     | \u00a3128,546         | \u00a333,873 | \u00a357,417 | \u00a394,673 | 17\u00b718 | 28\u00b732 | 382,847 |\n| 1875-76 | \u00a3100,571    | \u00a3140,999         | \u00a337,515 | \u00a363,356 | \u00a3103,484 | 16\u00b764 | 27\u00b718 | 309,595 |\n| 1876-77 | \u00a378,813     | \u00a3126,405         | \u00a338,937 | \u00a348,876 | \u00a387,468 | 1\u00b713 | 20\u00b723 | 366,482 |\n| 1877-78 | \u00a399,210     | \u00a3136,586         | \u00a341,872 | \u00a357,338 | \u00a394,714 | 11\u00b774 | 19\u00b739 | 507,974 |\n| 1878-79 | \u00a3118,069    | \u00a3129,706         | \u00a341,600 | \u00a376,462 | \u00a387,399 | 13\u00b728 | 15\u00b717 | 398,460 |\n| 1879-80 | \u00a3113,086    | \u00a3140,669         | \u00a347,563 | \u00a365,523 | \u00a393,106 | 9\u00b796 | 14\u00b717 | 310,686 |\n| 1880-81 | \u00a391,012     | \u00a3181,774         | \u00a340,825 | \u00a350,187 | \u00a3140,949 | 7\u00b717 | 20\u00b713 | 265,556 |\n| 1881-82 | \u00a3120,125    | \u00a3123,933         | \u00a343,116 | \u00a377,009 | \u00a380,817 | 9\u00b783 | 10\u00b731 | 300,545 |\n| 1882-83 | \u00a3115,949    | \u00a3121,785         | \u00a347,179 | \u00a368,770 | \u00a374,606 | 8\u00b729 | 9\u00b700 | 374,243 |\n| 1883-84 | \u00a3139,240    | \u00a3145,504         | \u00a347,766 | \u00a391,474 | \u00a397,738 | 10\u00b734 | 11\u00b704 | 472,426 |\nThe indirect revenue represents the increase in the receipts from the land-tax, in consequence of the benefits derived from irrigation. The works for the restored canal system above described, as based on the old native works, were begun by Captain Blane and carried out by Major John Colvin. In addition, a costly work now (1884) nearly completed, in the reformation of the middle section of the canal, with a view to the reclamation of swamps and saline efflorescence, produced by the bad alignment of the old canal and its interference with the surface drainage of the country, which have rendered barren thousands of fruitful acres, ruined many populous homesteads, and undermined the health of the whole country-side. This project embraces new permanent head-works on the Jumna; a new main line, taking off from the old channel about 15 miles above Karn\u00e1l, and terminating at the 28th mile in new regulators for the Delhi and H\u00e1ns\u00ed branches; a new channel in substitution for the first 55 miles of the former branch; the remodelling of the first 20 miles of that branch; a navigation canal 9\u00be miles in length to connect the Delhi branch with the lately opened Agra Canal; and drainage works in the irrigated tract and improvement of the outfall into the river Jumna from the Najafgarh jhil, the natural receptacle for the drainage from a portion of the irrigated districts. These rectifications have been rapidly pushed on with. The new head-works on the Jumna have been in use since 1878. The remodelling of the canal and the construction of new distributaries are (1884) approaching completion; some of the drainage schemes connected with them are in hand, while others are being elaborated or are under consideration.\n\n**Jun\u00e1garh** (or **Jun\u00e1gadh**).\u2014Native State under the Political Agency of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency. Lat. 20\u00b0 48\u2032 to 21\u00b0 40\u2032 N., long. 69\u00b0 55\u2032 to 71\u00b0 35\u2032 E. Area, 3283 square miles. Population (1872) 380,921; (1881) 387,499; number of towns, 7; number of villages, 850; houses, 6578; estimated gross revenue, \u00a3200,000. Distributed according to religion, the population consists of\u2014Hindus, 306,295; Muhammadans, 76,401; \u2018others,\u2019 4803. Since 1872, the population has increased by 6578. The only elevation rising above the general level of the plain is the Girn\u00e1r group of hills, the highest peak of which, Gorakhn\u00e1th, is about 3666 feet above sea-level. There is also a densely-wooded tract called the Gir, hilly in some parts, but in others so low as to be liable to floods during the rainy season. The soil is generally black, but in certain spots the lighter varieties are found. Irrigation is commonly practised by means of water brought in canals, or drawn from wells by the Persian wheel and the leathern bag. The climate is upon the whole healthy, though, except on the Girn\u00e1r Hill, the heat is excessive from the beginning of April to the middle of July. Fever and dysentery are the prevailing\ndiseases. Stone exists suited for building purposes. The agricultural products comprise\u2014cotton, shipped in considerable quantities from the port of Ver\u00e1wal to Bombay; wheat; the ordinary varieties of pulse and millet; oil-seeds; and sugar-cane, both the indigenous and Mauritius varieties. The manufactured articles are oil and coarse cotton cloth.\n\nThe coast-line is well supplied with fair-weather harbours, suited for native craft. Of the harbours, the chief are Ver\u00e1wal, Nawa-bandar, and Sutr\u00e1p\u00e1r\u00e1. The main roads through the State are from Jun\u00e1garh towards Jetpur and Dhor\u00e1j\u00ed, and from Jun\u00e1garh to Ver\u00e1wal. The ordinary country tracks serve in the fair season for the passage of carts, pack-bullocks, and horses. There are 34 schools, with 1960 pupils. Places of interest include\u2014the sacred mountain of Girn\u00e1r, crowned with Jain temples; the port of Ver\u00e1wal; and the ruined temple of Somnath.\n\nJun\u00e1garh ranks as a first-class State among the many petty States of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. Its ruler first entered into engagements with the British Government in 1807. The present (1884) chief, who is entitled to a salute of 11 guns, succeeded his father, Sir Mohobat Kh\u00e1nj\u00ed, K.C.S.I., who died on the 29th September 1882. His name is Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1nj\u00ed, and his title, Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh. He is twenty-nine years of age, and was installed on the 1st October 1882. He is ninth in succession from Sher Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi, the founder of the family. He pays to the British Government and the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda a yearly tribute of \u00a36560, 8s., and maintains a military force of 2682 men. He holds a sanad authorizing adoption, and the succession follows the rule of primogeniture. He has power of life and death over his own subjects. He has entered into engagements to prohibit sat\u00ed, and to exempt from duty vessels entering his ports through stress of weather.\n\nUntil 1472 A.D., when it was conquered by Sult\u00e1n Muhammad Begar\u00e1 of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, Jun\u00e1garh was a R\u00e1jput State, ruled by chiefs of the Ch\u00far\u00e1sam\u00e1 tribe. During the reign of the Emperor Akbar, it became a dependency of the Court of Delhi, under the immediate authority of the Mughal Viceroy of Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t). About 1735, when the representative of the Mughals had lost his authority in Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t, Sher Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi, a soldier of fortune under the viceroy, expelled the Mughal governor, and established his own rule. Sher Kh\u00e1n\u2019s son, Sal\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n, appointed his heir chief of Jun\u00e1garh, assigning to his younger sons the lands of B\u00e1ntw\u00e1.\n\nThough himself tributary to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda and the British Government, the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh receives yearly contributions, called zortalabi, from a large number of petty chiefs in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. This levy, which is collected and paid to the Naw\u00e1b by British officers of the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r Agency, is a relic of the days of Muhammadan supremacy.\n\nJun\u00e1garh.\u2014Chief town of the Native State of Jun\u00e1garh, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r,\nBombay Presidency. Lat. 21\u00b0 31' N., long. 70\u00b0 36' 30\" E., 60 miles southwest of R\u00e1jkot. Population (1872) 20,025; (1881) 24,679, namely, 13,605 males and 11,074 females. Hindus numbered 12,910; Muhammadans, 11,287; Jains, 462; Christians, 19; and Parsi, 1.\n\nJun\u00e1garh, situated under the Girn\u00e1r and D\u00e1t\u00e1r hills, is one of the most picturesque cities in India, while in antiquity and historical interest it yields to none. The Up\u00e1rkot or old citadel contains interesting Buddhist caves, and the whole of the ditch and neighbourhood is honeycombed with caves or their remains. The most interesting of these, called Kh\u00e1pr\u00edkodia, have the appearance of having been once a monastery, two or three storeys in height. Dr. Burgess, in his Antiquities of Cutch and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, has fully described these caves. The ditch is cut entirely out of the rock, and forms a strong defence. In the Up\u00e1rkot are two vavs, said to be built by slave girls of Chud\u00e1sama rulers of olden times; a mosque built by Sult\u00e1n Mahmud Begara; near the mosque is a cannon 17 feet long, 7\u00bd feet in circumference at the breech, and 9\u00bd inches in diameter at the muzzle; another large cannon in the southern portion of the fort is 13 feet long, and has a muzzle 14 inches in diameter. The Up\u00e1rkot has been many times besieged, and often taken, on which occasions the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was wont to flee to the fort on Girnar, which from its inaccessibility was almost impregnable. Of late years a fine hospital and other public buildings have been erected, and the town has been much improved by fine houses built by the nobles of the court. A collection of shops called M\u00e1habat circle is in front of the Naw\u00e1b's palace. Here is a clock tower. Up\u00e1rkot is the ancient Jun\u00e1garh. The present town is more correctly called Mustaf\u00e1b\u00e1d, and was built by Mahmud Begada of Gujar\u00e1t.\n\nJun\u00e1p\u00e1dar.\u2014Petty State in Gohelw\u00e1r Sub-division, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. It consists of 1 village, Jun\u00e1p\u00e1dar, with 1 separate tribute-payer. The revenue in 1876 was estimated at \u00a355; and tribute of \u00a34, 4s. is paid to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and 16s. to Jun\u00e1garh. Population (1881) 199. The t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs are Khasi\u00e1 Kolis.\n\nJungle Mah\u00e1ls.\u2014Formerly a Western District of Lower Bengal. The Jungle Mah\u00e1ls was originally a vague term applied in the last century to the British possessions and semi-independent chiefdoms lying between the regular Districts of B\u00edrbh\u00fam, Bardw\u00e1n, and B\u00e1nkur\u00e1, and the hill country of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur. As the administration became more precise, inconvenience arose from the vagueness of the jurisdiction, the stoppage of writs, etc. Accordingly Regulation xviii. of 1805 erected the Jungle Mah\u00e1ls into a distinctly defined District, consisting of 15 pargan\u00e1s or mah\u00e1ls from B\u00edrbh\u00fam District (including Pachete), 3 from Bardw\u00e1n (including most of Bishnupur), and 5 from Midnapur (including M\u00e1nbh\u00fam and Bar\u00e1bh\u00fam). The separate District of the Jungle Mah\u00e1ls was abolished by Regulation xiii. of 1833, and the\nterritory redistributed among the adjoining Districts. It is now comprised within the western parts of B\u012br bh\u016bm and the Sant\u0101l Pargan\u0101s, Bankur\u0101 and Midnapur Districts, and within the eastern Districts of the Chuti\u0101 Nagpur Division, especially M\u0101nbh\u016bm. The tract lies between lat. $21^\\circ 51' 30''$ and $22^\\circ 48' 30''$ N., and long. $86^\\circ 36'$ and $87^\\circ 16'$ E. Regulation xviii. of 1805 affords an interesting illustration of the elaborate rules and details involved in the erection of a separate jurisdiction under the Company. There is now no specific tract of country known as the Jungle Mah\u0101ls.\n\n**Junnar.**\u2014Sub-division of P\u016bna (Poona) District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 611 square miles; contains 1 town and 153 villages. Population (1881) 102,273, namely, 50,666 males and 51,607 females. Hindus numbered 95,748; Muhammadans, 5006; 'others,' 1519. Since 1872, the population has decreased by 4603. Revenue (1882\u201383), \u00a314,718. The Sub-division contains 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; number of police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 1; regular police, 48 men; village watchmen (chauk\u012bd\u0101rs), 93.\n\n**Junnar.**\u2014Chief town of Junnar Sub-division, Poona (P\u016bna) District, Bombay Presidency.

Junnar contains a sub-judge's court, post-office, and dispensary.\n\nThough fallen in size and importance since the time of Muhammadan rule, and by the subsequent transfer of the seat of government to Poona under the Mar\u0101th\u0101s, Junnar is still a place of considerable note, being the chief market of the northern part of the District, and a d\u00e9p\u00f4t for the grain and merchandise passing to the Konkan by the N\u0101n\u0101gh\u0101t. It was formerly celebrated for the manufacture of paper, but the low rates at which the European article is now sold, have almost driven native paper out of the market. The fort of Junnar, often noticed in Mar\u0101th\u0101 annals, was built by M\u0101lik-ul-Tujj\u0101r in 1436. In May 1557, Sivaj\u012b surprised and plundered the town, carrying off about \u00a3100,000 in specie, besides other valuable spoil. About a mile and a half south-west of the town of Junnar is the hill fort of Sivner, granted in 1599 to the grandfather of Sivaj\u012b, who is said to have been born here in 1627. During the turbulent times of Mar\u0101th\u0101 warfare Sivner was often taken and retaken, and once, in 1670, the forces of Sivaj\u012b himself were beaten back by its Mughal garrison. Besides fine gates and solid fortifications, it is celebrated for its deep springs. They rise in pools of great depth, supposed to be coeval with the series of Buddhist caves which pierce the lower portion of the scarp.\n\n**Junon\u0101.**\u2014Ancient village in Ch\u00e1nd\u0101 District, Central Provinces.\nLat. $19^\\circ 55' 30''$ N., long. $79^\\circ 26' E.$; six miles north of Ball\u00e1lpur, and perhaps connected with it when Ball\u00e1lpur was the Gond capital of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1. Possesses a fine tank, on the stone embankment of which stand the ruined remains of a palace; and in its rear are traces of a wall 4 miles long. An elaborate system of under-channels, now imperfect, communicates with the tank. Population (1881) 322.\n\n**Jutogh.**\u2014Small military station in Simla District, Punjab; situated on the top of a lofty and steep hill, a few miles from the town of Simla. The quarters of a mule battery of mountain artillery, and of a wing of the British regiment stationed at Sub\u00e1thu. Area, 365 acres. Population (1881) 953.\n\n**K.**\n\n**Kabadak** (or Kapot\u00e1ksha, 'Dove's Eye').\u2014River of Bengal. A deltaic distributary of the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1, branching off from that river near Ch\u00e1ndpur, in Nadiy\u00e1 District, whence it flows a winding easterly course for a few miles, after which it turns southwards, marking the boundary between Nadiy\u00e1 and the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s on the one hand and Jessor on the other. Five miles east of As\u00e1sun\u00ed in the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, it is joined by the Marichh\u00e1p G\u00e1ng, which communicates with the series of boat passages and canals from Calcutta; and two miles below this junction it sends off the Ch\u00e1ndkh\u00e1l kh\u00e1l eastwards into Jessor District, continuing the boat passage towards Khuln\u00e1, Dacca, etc. Farther to the south, in lat. $22^\\circ 13' 30''$ N., and long. $89^\\circ 20' E.$, the Kabadak unites with the Kholpetu\u00e1, and the combined stream then takes the successive names of the Pang\u00e1s\u00ed, B\u00e1ra, P\u00e1ng\u00e1, Namgad, Samudra, and near the sea, Malanch\u00e1, under which name it falls into the Bay of Bengal.\n\n**K\u00e1b\u00e1r.**\u2014Lake or marsh in Monghyr District, Bengal, lying between $25^\\circ 35' 30''$ and $25^\\circ 39' 30''$ N. lat., and between $86^\\circ 9'$ and $86^\\circ 13'$ E. long. The chief of a chain of marshes running along the north of the District, with high and abrupt banks, which seem to indicate that they owe their origin to a change of course in the Ganges or Gandak. They are annually filled by the floods of these rivers, and abound in crocodiles, fish, and wild-fowl.\n\n**Ka-baung.**\u2014A river in Taung-gn\u00fa District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. Rises in the Pegu Yoma Hills, and after a south-west course of 68 miles falls into the Tsit-taung just below Taung-gn\u00fa, and for some distance up is a fine broad stream. Navigable for about 25 miles; teak, *theng-gan* (used for boat-building), sesamum, etc., are brought down this stream for the Taung-gn\u00fa market.\n\n**Kabbal-durga.**\u2014Conical hill in Malvalli taluk of Mysore District, Mysore State, in the watershed between the Shimsha and Arkavati rivers.\nLat. 12\u00b0 30' N., long. 77\u00b0 22' E. It is fortified, and accessible only on one side by narrow steps hewn in the rock. Used as a penal settlement under the Hindu and Musalm\u00e1n dynasties, 'where the insalubrity of the climate was mercifully added to the unwholesome water to shorten the sufferings of State prisoners.' It was dismantled and abandoned in 1864. The name of Jaffar\u00e1b\u00e1d, given by Haidar Al\u00ed, is now forgotten.\n\n**Kabbani.**\u2014River of Mysore and Madras Presidency.\u2014See Kapini.\n\n**Kabr\u00e1i.**\u2014Town in Ham\u00edrpur District, North-Western Provinces. Population (1881) 2272. Situated near the Brahm T\u00e1l, an extensive tank, now much silted up, but once a fine sheet of water, the construction of which is attributed to the Chandel R\u00e1j\u00e1 Babrahm. Ruins of ancient temples and other architectural remains are still shown on its banks.\n\n**K\u00e1b\u00fal (K\u00e1b\u00e1).**\u2014Principal Province of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, bounded on the north-west by the Koh-i-B\u00e1ba; on the north by the Hindu-K\u00fash; on the north-east by the Panjsher river; on the east by the Sul\u00e1im\u00e1n range; on the south by the S\u00e1f\u00e9d Koh and Ghazn\u00ed; and on the west by the hill country of the Haz\u00e1ras. The following articles on the Province, city, and river of K\u00e1b\u00fal are condensed from General Sir C. M. Macgregor's Account (1871), brought up to 1882 by Lieut.-Col. W. S. A. Lockhart:\n\nThe Province of K\u00e1b\u00fal is mountainous, but contains many rich arable valleys along the base of the hills. Wheat is the chief product, and after it barley. The poorest classes consume a considerable proportion of barley and pease in their food. There are none so poor but that they occasionally indulge in animal food, and the rich in a great measure subsist on it. Corn is imported from as far as the environs of Ghazn\u00ed. Rice is brought from Upper Bangash, Jak\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, Laghm\u00e1n, and even K\u00fan\u00e1r; in a dear year corn is sometimes brought from B\u00e1mi\u00e1n in small quantities. The supply of gh\u00ed is chiefly from B\u00e1mi\u00e1n and the Haz\u00e1raj\u00e1t. The quantity of grain annually imported into the valley does not bear a great proportion to that produced in it, and provisions are seldom dear. In the valleys a good deal of wood is cultivated\u2014willows and sycamores. In Koh\u00edst\u00e1n and Kuram there is abundance of timber. The orchards of K\u00e1b\u00fal, which are very numerous, are chiefly in the Koh D\u00e1man; and in it the valley of Ist\u00e1l\u00edf is celebrated for the excellence and profusion of its fruits, and also for its picturesque beauties. The chief pasturage is in Logar, and on the south, as also towards Ghorband. The Division of B\u00fatkh\u00e1k is that in which agriculture is most pursued. In the whole valley the watered lands much exceed the unwatered, but in the southern skirts there are some small spaces in which the reverse is true. Fodder is plentiful in K\u00e1b\u00fal and most parts of the valley; artificial grasses constitute a considerable part of it in those quarters where pasturage is\nmuch pursued. A part of the population live in tents in summer, but otherwise stone or brick houses are used, and the most common kind is the flat-roofed. The chief stock is in cows, except where pasturage is followed, and there sheep are a more important object. A considerable trade is carried on by the K\u00e1bulis, especially with Turkist\u00e1n and Hindust\u00e1n. A trade in horses and ponies is carried on with Turkist\u00e1n.\n\nThe villages are of various sizes, and on an average contain 150 families; they are not fortified, but invariably contain small castles or private forts of no strength. There are few wastes or spaces ill supplied with water in the whole Province; such as do exist are towards the south and the north-west limits. With respect to carriage, bullocks are chiefly used within the valley; those who trade to Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n employ camels; in the east and south of the Province, camels, mules, and ponies are used; in the Haz\u00e1ra country, mules and ponies. The Ghilzais, who trade to Turkist\u00e1n by the road of B\u00e1m\u00ed\u00e1n, use camels. The heavy custom dues imposed in Russian Turkist\u00e1n have affected the trade of the Province. Cotton fabrics, tea, and other products of British India no longer pass upward to the extent of former years, and the K\u00e1b\u00fal authorities have therefore lost the revenue accruing from transit dues. The hak\u00edm, or governor of the Province, was in 1882 Sard\u00e1r Ahmad Kh\u00e1n, half-brother to the late Am\u00edr Sher \u00c1l\u00ed Kh\u00e1n. The revenue of K\u00e1b\u00fal Province amounts to \u00a3180,000. Its military force is greater than that of any other Province of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n. The country is by nature strong, and it has good roads through it.\n\nK\u00e1b\u00fal (K\u00e1b\u00e1l).\u2014The capital of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n; situated between the rivers K\u00e1b\u00fal and Logar near their junction, 88 miles from Ghazn\u00ed, 229 miles from Khil\u00e1t-\u00ed-Ghilz\u00e1\u00ed, 316 miles from Kandah\u00e1r, 94 miles from Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, 175 miles from Pesh\u00e1war, and 687 miles from Her\u00e1t by Kandah\u00e1r. Lat. 34\u00b0 30' N., long. 69\u00b0 18' E. Population, according to a Census taken by order of the Am\u00edr Sher \u00c1l\u00ed in 1876, about 140,000.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The city of K\u00e1b\u00fal is situated at the west extremity of a spacious plain, in an angle formed by the approach of two inferior ridges, the Koh Takht Sh\u00e1h and the Koh Khoja Safar. With the exception of a suburb, it lies on the right bank of the K\u00e1b\u00fal river. It is about three miles in circumference. To the east and south-east is the B\u00e1la Hiss\u00e1r, or citadel. There are no walls round the city at the present time, though formerly it was encircled by walls constructed partly of burnt bricks, and partly of mud, the trace of which remains most abundantly in the east quarter. The space included within the walls being largely filled with gardens, does not contain above 5000 houses; anciently it may be presumed to have comprised a\nlower number. Seven gates allowed ingress and egress to and from the old city: the Darw\u00e1zas Lahor\u00ed, Sird\u00e1r, Pet, Deh Afgh\u00e1n\u00e1n, Deh Mazang, Guzar G\u00e1h, and Jabr. Of these, the Darw\u00e1zas Lahor\u00ed and Sird\u00e1r are the only ones now standing, being built of deeply coloured kiln-burnt bricks. That of Jabr was removed many years ago. The sites of those no longer existing, besides being well known, are the stations of officers appointed to collect the town duties on the necessaries of life brought in from the country. Some of the names by which the gates are now known, or remembered, would seem to have replaced more ancient ones.\n\nThe houses of K\u00e1b\u00fal are but slightly and indifferently built, generally of mud and unburnt bricks. The few of burnt brick are those of old standing. Their general want of substantiality does not militate against their being conveniently arranged within, as many of them are, particularly those built by the Shi\u00e1s in Chandol and other quarters. The city is divided into quarters (mahalas), and these again are separated into sections (k\u00edchas). The latter are enclosed and entered by small gates. On occasions of war or tumult, the entrance gates are built up, and the city contains as many different fortresses as there are sections in it. This means of defence is called 'K\u00fachaband\u00ed.' It must be obvious that an insecure state of society has induced this precautionary mode of arrangement in the building of the city. The necessity to adopt it has occasioned the narrow and inconvenient passages of communication, or streets, if they must be so called, which intersect the several sections. The principal b\u00e1z\u00e1rs of the city are independent of the sections, and extend generally in straight lines.\n\nThere are no public buildings of any importance in the city. The mosques, or places of worship, are far from being splendid edifices, although many are spacious and commodious; convenience and utility, rather than specious external appearance, has been sought for in their construction. Outside the city lie the fine tombs of the Emperor B\u00e1bar and of Tim\u00far Sh\u00e1h. The residence of former monarchs was the B\u00e1l\u00e1 Hiss\u00e1r, but the present Am\u00edr, Abdur Rahm\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, has his residence in the city. There is but one college, and this without endowment or scholars. There are some 14 or 15 sar\u00e1\u00eds or kar\u00edvansar\u00e1\u00eds for the accommodation of foreign merchants and traders, named sometimes after their founders, as the Sar\u00e1i Zird\u00e1d, the Sar\u00e1i Muhammad R\u00fam\u00ed, etc., sometimes after the place whose traders in preference frequent it, as the Sar\u00e1i Kandah\u00e1r\u00ed, etc. These structures will bear no comparison with the elegant and commodious buildings of the same kind so numerous in the cities and country of Persia. Hammams or public baths, being indispensable appendages to a Muhammadan city, are in some number, but they are deficient in\nthe matter of cleanliness. The approach to many of them is announced by an unwelcome odour, arising from the offensive fuel employed to heat them.\n\nOf the several b\u00e1z\u00e1rs of the city, the two principal, running irregularly parallel to each other, are the Shor b\u00e1z\u00e1r, and the b\u00e1z\u00e1r of the Darw\u00e1za Lahor\u00ed. The former, to the south, extends east and west from the B\u00e1la Hiss\u00e1r P\u00e1\u00edn to the Z\u00ed\u00e1rat B\u00e1ba Kh\u00fad\u00ed, a distance of a little more than three-quarters of a mile. The latter, stretching from the Darw\u00e1za Lahor\u00ed, terminates at the Chab\u00fattra, at which point there is a street to the south, called Chob Farosh or the wood market, communicating with the western extremity of the Shor b\u00e1z\u00e1r. To the north, another street leads from the Chab\u00fattra to the Kisht\u00ed. The western portion of the b\u00e1z\u00e1r Darw\u00e1za Lahor\u00ed is occupied by the Ch\u00e1r Ch\u00e1ta, or four covered arcades, the most magnificent of the K\u00e1b\u00fal b\u00e1z\u00e1rs, of which the inhabitants are justly proud. The structure is inscribed to Ali Mard\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, whose name is immortal in these countries, from the many visible testimonies to his public spirit extant in various forms. It is handsomely constructed and highly embellished with paintings. The four covered arcades, of equal length and dimensions, are separated from each other by square open areas, originally provided with wells and fountains. These were judicious improvements on the plan in vogue throughout Persia, where the covered b\u00e1z\u00e1rs, extending in some of the larger cities for above 2 miles, not only exclude the rays of the sun, but completely prevent the free circulation of air, producing thereby close and oppressive and, it may be presumed, unhealthy atmospheres.\n\nThe shops of the Ch\u00e1r Ch\u00e1ta are now tenanted by retail vendors of manufactured goods, whether of wool, cotton, or silk. Before the shops are what may be called counters, on which sit, with their wares displayed, silk-mercers, makers of caps, shoes, etc., and money-changers, with their heaps of copper money before them. Beneath the counters are stalls; and as they exactly resemble the cobblers' stalls of London in situation and appearance, so are they generally occupied by the same class of craftsmen. In K\u00e1b\u00fal, as in other places, all traffic is transacted through the medium of the broker. Besides the shopkeepers, or fixed tradesmen, a vast number of itinerant traders parade the b\u00e1z\u00e1rs; it is probable that the cries of K\u00e1b\u00fal equal in variety those of London. Inclusive of the B\u00e1la Hiss\u00e1r, the number of houses in K\u00e1b\u00fal is about 9000, of which nearly one-half are occupied by Shi\u00e1 families. The population may therefore be computed at something between fifty and sixty thousand. In the summer season, from the influx of merchants and people from all parts of the country, the city is very densely inhabited; and this pressure of strangers explains the crowds and bustle to be witnessed in the b\u00e1z\u00e1rs, with the great propor-\ntion of itinerant traders in cooked provisions and the necessaries of life, who may be said to infest the streets.\n\nThe appearance of K\u00e1b\u00fal as a city has little to recommend it beyond the interest conferred by the surrounding scenery. It is best approached, and, indeed, can only be seen, from the east. In that direction the traveller catches his first view of the low country from the crest of the Pass of Lataband. Formerly a canopied apartment of the palace of K\u00e1b\u00fal was cased in copper gilt, which, besides being very ornamental, had a conspicuous effect in the obscure and indistinct mass presented by the city from the Kotal, or crest of the pass.\n\nAcross the river which flows through K\u00e1b\u00fal, so far as the city is concerned, there can be said to be only one bridge, viz. the P\u00fal-i-Kisht\u00ed (brick bridge). This is a substantial structure, however ill kept in repair, of mixed brickwork and masonry. It leads directly into the busy parts of the city, where the custom-house, corn market, the covered arcades, and the principal b\u00e1z\u00e1rs are found. At a little distance east of it is the so-called P\u00fal Nawa, or the canoe bridge, composed of the hollowed trunks of trees joined to each other. It affords a tremulous passage to pedestrians who choose to venture over it, and connects the quarters B\u00e1gh Al\u00ed Mard\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n and Mor\u00e1d Kh\u00e1n\u00ed. To the west, at the gorge between the two hills through which the river enters upon the city, is the fortified bridge of Sird\u00e1r Jah\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n. This is sometimes called the bridge of Nasir Kh\u00e1n, and is probably due to the governor so named who flourished at the epoch of Nadir Sh\u00e1h\u2019s invasion. It is believed that he was one of the dignitaries who connected with this bridge the lines of fortifications over the hills; and that he built the parapet wall which fringes the western or exterior face of the bridge. Between this structure and the P\u00fal-i-Kisht\u00ed was anciently a bridge connecting Chandol, on the southern side of the stream, with the Indar\u00e1b\u00ed quarter on the opposite side.\n\nBeyond the P\u00fal Nawa, and altogether without the city, is another once substantial bridge thrown across the stream, said to owe its origin to B\u00e1bar. It became injured through age and neglect; but being on the road from the palace of the B\u00e1l\u00e1 Hiss\u00e1r to the royal gardens, it was necessary to repair it; and at length, in the reign of Zann\u00e1n Sh\u00e1h, it was restored by the governor of the city, Sird\u00e1r Jah\u00e1n Nas\u00edr Kh\u00e1n, whose name it yet bears. It has, however, again become dilapidated. The river has yet another bridge traversing it west of the fortified bridge at the gorge of the two hills, and parallel to the tomb of the celebrated B\u00e1bar. It is a substantial erection, and its date is probably that of the tomb and its appendages, of which it may be considered one. The river has, therefore, in K\u00e1b\u00fal and the immediate vicinity four permanent bridges crossing it. The canoe bridge is not entitled to be included, being little more important\nthan a plank placed across a rivulet. Besides these bridges, the river has no other, either to the east or west of them, in the upper part of its course being easily fordable, and soon terminating its lower section by joining with the river of Logar.\n\nK\u00e1bul was first made the capital of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n by Tim\u00far Sh\u00e1h, and it continued to be the capital throughout the period of the S\u00e1duz\u00e1\u00ed dynasty. On the fall of the S\u00e1duz\u00e1\u00eds, K\u00e1bul came into the hands of Dost Muhammad, who became Amir, and retained it for his capital.\n\nInhabitants, etc.\u2014The Emperor B\u00e1bar boasts of the commercial importance of K\u00e1bul, and the consequent resort to it of the merchants of all countries, and the display in its markets of the fabrics and produce of all climes. The eminent advantage possessed by K\u00e1bul is that of locality. This is conferred by nature; and so long as the present conformation of hill and plain endures, the city will preserve and enjoy it. There has always been a commercial communication between India and the regions of Turk\u00edst\u00e1n. K\u00e1bul, happily situated at the gorge of the nearest and most practicable passes connecting the two countries, will always profit by the intercourse between them. The presence of the court, and of a comparatively large military force, not a little contributes to the bustle and activity to be observed in the city. It also imparts life and vigour to many professions and crafts engaged in the preparation of warlike instruments and necessaries. As a class, the artisans, while not inexpert and perfectly competent to meet the wants of their customers, do not excel. There is not an article made or wrought in K\u00e1bul which is not surpassed by specimens from other countries. It is probable that many of the trades did not exist before the foundation of the monarchy, and they should, perhaps, be even now considered in a state of progression, a remark perhaps applicable to the whole country. With respect to the trade of K\u00e1bul, it may be observed that there are six points within Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n where duties on merchandise are levied, viz. K\u00e1bul, Ghazn\u00ed, B\u00e1mi\u00e1n, Ch\u00e1rik\u00e1r, Logar, and Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nK\u00e1bul is abundantly supplied with water, which is generally of good quality. The river, on its entrance from the plain of Ch\u00e1r Deh, is beautifully transparent; but after a course of a few hundred yards, its waters are little used by the inhabitants of the city as a beverage, from a belief that their quality is impaired by the large quantities of clothes cleansed in the river preparatory to bleaching upon its banks. Parallel to the river, in the first part of its course, is the canal called J\u00fa\u00ed Shar\u00edn, whose water is esteemed excellent. The southern parts of the city are supplied with water from a canal called B\u00e1l\u00e1 J\u00fa\u00ed, which is brought from the river at its entrance into the plain of Ch\u00e1r Deh, and being carried on the western face of the hill, Koh Takht Sh\u00e1h, passes the sepulchre\nof B\u00e1bar, and thence winds around the same hill until it reaches the B\u00e1la Hiss\u00e1r. Without the B\u00e1la Hiss\u00e1r, to the east, flows a canal, the J\u00fa\u00ed P\u00fal Mast\u00e1n, whose water is held in high repute. It is derived from the river of Logar as it enters the plain of Shevak\u00ed, and has a course of about five miles, a length little inferior to that of the B\u00e1la J\u00fa\u00ed.\n\nThere are many wells throughout the various quarters of the city, and in the B\u00e1la Hiss\u00e1r. The waters of these are more or less esteemed, but are generally considered heavy, and decidedly inferior to river water undefiled. The monarchs were accustomed to have the water drunk by them brought from Shakar D\u00e1ra, a distance of nine miles; and experiments are narrated, testing its superiority over that of the neighbouring valleys of Ferzah, etc. The existence of the marshy ground to the north is by no means beneficial to the health of the city; for it cannot fail to be remarked, that in those years when the accumulation of water is large, dangerous autumnal fevers prevail, and that the contrary happens under converse conditions. In cases of excessive rainfall, the ordinary causes of diminution, absorption, and evaporation are not sufficient to carry off or dissipate the mass, and the superfluity stagnates towards the close of autumn. The effluvia arising from this putrid collection are borne full upon the city by the prevailing winds, particularly by the northerly winds of Parwan, which incessantly rage at that time of the year, and sweep over the more noxious chaman of Waz\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d and Bemar\u00fa. Still K\u00e1b\u00fal may not be considered an unhealthy city. Its disadvantages, besides those just noted, are\u2014its situation, wedged in, as it were, between two hills, its confined streets and buildings, with the evils consequent upon them. In compensation, it has the benefits of a fine atmosphere, excellent water and provisions, with delightful environs. The range of thermometer at K\u00e1b\u00fal from the 6th to the end of August in 1839 was from $46^\\circ$ to $74^\\circ$ F. at 4 A.M., and at 3 P.M. from $72^\\circ$ to $96^\\circ$; in September at 4 A.M. $50^\\circ$ to $64^\\circ$, and at 3 P.M. $70^\\circ$ to $90^\\circ$; from 1st to 14th October at 4 A.M. $30^\\circ$ to $56^\\circ$, at 3 P.M. $64^\\circ$ to $92^\\circ$. From 4th to the end of July 1880 the thermometer ranged from $42^\\circ$ to $103^\\circ$ at 9 A.M., and from $56^\\circ$ to $105^\\circ$ at 3 P.M.\n\nThe defences of K\u00e1b\u00fal have been carefully described in Colonel Macgregor's Report, but need not be detailed here. The city played an important part in the first Afgh\u00e1n war. On the 7th August 1839, Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1 entered K\u00e1b\u00fal as Am\u00edr, escorted by a British army. Throughout that year and the next, the British troops remained without hindrance. On the 2nd November 1841, the citizens and Afgh\u00e1n soldiery broke out in rebellion against the Am\u00edr Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1, and murdered him. On the 21st December, the English Resident, Sir William MacNaghten, was treacherously shot by Akbar Kh\u00e1n, at an interview for arranging the terms for the British troops withdrawing\nfrom the city. On the 6th January, the British forces marched out under solemn guarantee of protection,\u20144500 fighting men, with 12,000 followers. Their fate is well known; of all that number only one man, Dr. Brydon, reached Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, and 95 prisoners were subsequently recovered from the Afgh\u00e1ns. On the 15th September 1842, General Pollock, with his army of retribution, arrived at K\u00e1b\u00fal, took possession of the citadel (B\u00e1l\u00e1 Hiss\u00e1r) without opposition, and the British forces remained there till 12th October, when the city was evacuated. Previous to the departure of the army, the great b\u00e1z\u00e1r, the Ch\u00e1r Ch\u00e1ta, was destroyed by gunpowder as a retribution for the murder of Sir William MacNaghten, and the indignities offered to his remains on this spot.\n\nBy the treaty of Gandamak, in May 1879, a British Resident was to be stationed at K\u00e1b\u00fal. (See Afghanistan, vol. i. p. 52.) Accordingly, Major (afterwards Sir Louis) Cavagnari was appointed to this post, and was welcomed to the city with great apparent cordiality by the Amir Y\u00e1kub Kh\u00e1n. Owing to intrigues which will probably never be unravelled, the fanatical party was allowed to gain head; and on the 3rd September 1879, the British Residency was attacked by a rabble of towns-people and troops, and Sir Louis Cavagnari and his escort were murdered, after a gallant defence.\n\nOrders were immediately given for the despatch of an avenging force from the Kuram valley under Sir Frederick Roberts. The first move towards the Shutar-gardan Pass was made on the 8th of September; the pass was occupied on the 13th; and by the 26th of the month about 6000 men were concentrated at Khushi ready for an advance upon K\u00e1b\u00fal. The advance, which then immediately began, was not seriously checked until General Roberts arrived on the 5th October at Char-as\u00eda, 11 miles from K\u00e1b\u00fal. Further progress next morning through the Sang-i-Nawishta defile was opposed by a considerable force. The enemy showed in regular formation along the ridge extending from both sides of the Sang-i-Nawishta defile to the heights above the Chardeh valley. Observing that they were concentrating upon the left, in anticipation of the main attack in that direction, Sir F. Roberts resolved upon holding them in check by a feint attack in the direction of the defile, while an outflanking movement was undertaken upon the enemy's right. These tactics proved completely successful, but the resistance offered by the Afgh\u00e1ns was exceedingly stubborn. Before evening the peaks overlooking the Sang-i-Nawishta defile were in our hands, and a small force was pushed through into the plain beyond. On the 8th October, General Roberts occupied the Sherpur Cantonments north of K\u00e1b\u00fal, capturing 76 guns and howitzers of different calibres; and on the following day the city itself fell into his hands after a feeble show of resistance.\n\nThe B\u00e1l\u00e1 Hiss\u00e1r, including the fort and palace, was partially dis-\nmantled; the Amir Y\u00e1kub Kh\u00e1n abdicated; and the guilty city remained under British occupation for nearly a year. A provisional government was instituted, road communication was opened between K\u00e1b\u00fal and Pesh\u00e1war by the Khaibar Pass, and the telegraph was completed between these places. Supplies were at first abundantly procurable, and when the troops prepared to go into winter quarters at Sherpur, there was every appearance of local opposition having been broken down, or having melted away.\n\nEarly in December, however, it became apparent that disaffection among the tribes was increasing. They had probably looked for the speedy withdrawal of the British troops after exacting retribution for the murder of the Envoy, and the prolonged occupation of the capital had inflamed the national antipathy. It was considered necessary, therefore, before settling finally into winter quarters, to take decided steps for the pacification of the neighbouring Districts. After a general parade of British troops in the plain north of K\u00e1b\u00fal, two small brigades under Generals Macpherson and Baker were sent to break up some hostile gatherings to the westward. It then appeared that the rising was far more widespread than had been supposed, and after five days' incessant fighting round K\u00e1b\u00fal, during which the enemy lost very heavily, their numbers had been so largely increased by the arrival of fresh levies, that General Roberts found it impossible any longer to make head against them. By the evening of the 14th December the British forces were all collected within the walls of the Sherpur cantonments, the Afgh\u00e1ns being permitted to take possession of the city, the B\u00e1l\u00e1 Hiss\u00e1r, and the surrounding heights. In Sherpur the force remained more or less closely invested, until the crowning effort of the enemy was made and repulsed upon the morning of the 23rd of December. On that day General Roberts was attacked by fully 50,000 men; but they were beaten off without difficulty, and on the following day an additional brigade under General Charles Gough having joined General Roberts' force, the city of K\u00e1b\u00fal was again in our hands. The enemy's levies disappeared as rapidly as they had assembled.\n\nAfter three months of comparative quiet, during which General Sir Donald Stewart marched up from Kandah\u00e1r to K\u00e1b\u00fal and assumed command, negotiations were opened with Sard\u00e1r Abdur Rahman Kh\u00e1n, who had then crossed the Afgh\u00e1n border from Bokh\u00e1r\u00e1. In the month of July 1880, Abdur Rahman was recognised by the British Government as Amir of K\u00e1b\u00fal. Next month, about 10,000 men under General Roberts marched to Kandah\u00e1r to relieve the British garrison, which had been besieged there by Sard\u00e1r Ayub Kh\u00e1n after the disaster of Maiwand. Meanwhile arrangements for the withdrawal of the rest of the British forces by the Khaibar route had been concluded, and three days after General Roberts' departure, i.e. on the 11th August,\nSir Donald Stewart left K\u00e1b\u00fal for India. The B\u00e1l\u00e1 Hiss\u00e1r and the other positions which had been held by the British troops were handed over to the Am\u00edr\u2019s officials. The withdrawal of all troops from the Khaibar line was completed without difficulty by the 8th September 1880.\n\nSince then the Am\u00edr Abdur Rahman has remained in power at K\u00e1b\u00fal, and has gradually established and strengthened his hold upon the rest of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n. In June 1881, his supremacy was threatened by the advance of Sard\u00e1r Ayub Kh\u00e1n from Herat to Kandah\u00e1r, but the Am\u00edr marched in person against the invader, and eventually defeated him. Ayub Kh\u00e1n fled to Herat, and from thence to Persia. In October and November of the same year, during Abdur Rahman\u2019s absence from K\u00e1b\u00fal, the Wardaks and Koh\u00edst\u00e1n\u00eds attempted a rebellion, which, however, was crushed by the Am\u00edr\u2019s governor. Abdur Rahman himself returned to K\u00e1b\u00fal in December, and he has not since been forced to enter upon any military operations of serious importance.\n\nIn 1884, the Russians having occupied Merv and reached the border of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, a British Commission composed of 20 political and military officers, with 400 troops and a number of followers, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Ridgeway, marched through Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n to the neighbourhood of Herat with the view of delimiting the North-Western boundary in concert with the Russians. The march was very successfully conducted, and a new route was opened up via Quetta and Nushki. On arrival at the Persian border, the command of the party was taken over by General Sir P. Lumsden, who had been sent out from England. Meanwhile the Am\u00edr, who had shown an inclination to visit India, was invited in February 1885 by Lord Dufferin to attend a Darb\u00e1r at Rawal Pindi. The Am\u00edr accepted the invitation, and reached India at the end of March. He was received with considerable display, and a force of all arms was assembled to do honour to the occasion. The Am\u00edr was much gratified at the reception accorded to him, and returned to Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n after a fortnight\u2019s stay in British territory.\n\nK\u00e1b\u00fal.\u2014River of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n. The K\u00e1b\u00fal river is believed to rise from a copious spring at Sar-i-Chasmah, lat. 34\u00b0 21\u2032 N., long. 68\u00b0 20\u2032 E., and elevation 8400 feet; but there is said to be another source about 12 miles farther west, on the eastern declivity of the Un\u00e1i ridge. In its course the main stream is joined by many small tributaries from the south slopes of the Laghm\u00e1n range. It is at first an inconsiderable stream, everywhere fordable for 60 miles as far as K\u00e1b\u00fal, at a short distance beyond which place it receives the river of Logar from the south, and thenceforward is a rapid river with a great volume of water. About 40 miles below K\u00e1b\u00fal, it receives from the north the Panjsher river; 15 miles farther, the Tagao; 20 miles below, the united streams of Alingar\nand Al\u00edshang; and 20 miles farther, at B\u00e1lab\u00e1gh, the S\u00farkh-\u00e1b from the south. About 2 miles below Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d it is joined by a large river, the K\u00fan\u00e1r. After all these accessions, the K\u00e1b\u00fal river becomes a large stream and unfordable. Flowing with great force, it hugs the north side of the Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d valley until it enters the Mohmand Hills, when it presses towards the north base of the Kh\u00e1ibar range, and is confined between hills till it emerges into the Pesh\u00e1war valley at Michn\u00ed. Here it divides into two branches, called the Ad\u00faz\u00e1\u00ed and the Nag\u00fam\u00e1n. The Ad\u00faz\u00e1\u00ed, or north branch, receives in three branches the waters of the Sw\u00e1t river. The Nag\u00fam\u00e1n, or south branch, separates again into several smaller branches at M\u00faki to rejoin again at Zakhi, where also it receives the B\u00e1r\u00e1 river from the south, and then the two branches reunite at D\u00faoband\u00ed. Thence the K\u00e1b\u00fal river flows 40 miles east-south-east, and falls into the Indus at Attock (Atak), after a course of 300 miles, in lat. $33\u00b0\\ 55' N.$, and long. $72\u00b0\\ 16' E.$\n\nFrom Sar-i-Chasmah to Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, this river is of no value except for irrigation; but from Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d to D\u00faoband\u00ed, it affords safe and generally rapid descent by means of rafts of inflated skins. This mode of travelling is a good deal resorted to, especially when the Kh\u00e1ibar Pass is disturbed. It saves a distance of 10 marches, which may be traversed in 12 hours during the floods. From D\u00faoband\u00ed to Attock, the K\u00e1b\u00fal is navigable for boats of 40 or 50 tons.\n\nFrom its source at Sar-i-Chasmah to K\u00e1b\u00fal city the river is everywhere fordable. From K\u00e1b\u00fal city to Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d it is fordable at a short distance above Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d on the road to L\u00faghm\u00e1n in dry weather, and there are ferries at the village of Kutz, on the right bank. The fords, however, between K\u00e1b\u00fal and Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d are of a more or less temporary and precarious nature according to the season, and both at Sarob\u00ed (opposite Nagl\u00fa) and at Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d there are alternative fords and ferries. At the Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d ford on 31st March 1879, one officer and 46 non-commissioned officers and men of the 10th Hussars were swept away and drowned while attempting a passage in the dark. Opposite Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d there is a difficult ford in April, and thence to D\u00faoband\u00ed the ferries are at Goshta, Lalp\u00fara, Abkh\u00e1na, Dhaka, Prang (Ad\u00faz\u00e1\u00ed branch), Khal\u00ed Bandah (Nag\u00fam\u00e1n branch). Below D\u00faoband\u00ed are the following ferries:\n\n(1) Nisata to Khal\u00ed Bandah, from 2 to 6 boats. This is the principal ferry between Pesh\u00e1war and Y\u00fasafz\u00e1\u00ed through Hashtnagar. (2) Dehri Zard\u00e1d to Sh\u00e1h Alam, 2 boats. This ferry is little frequented. (3) Khaishk\u00ed to Pirp\u00e1i and Zakhel, 2 boats. This ferry is little frequented. (4) New Naoshahra to old Naoshahra. This is the largest ferry in connection with Y\u00fasafz\u00e1\u00ed. In the hot weather it employs from 6 to 8 boats. In the cold weather, and sometimes throughout the year, there is a bridge of boats below this ferry. (5) P\u00edrsabak to Badr\u00e1k\u00e1i. This ferry has been closed of late years. (6) Mis\u00edbandah to Akora, 2 boats.\nThis is the favourite ferry between the east portion of the Y\u00fasafz\u00e1\u00ed plain and the Khataks. (7) Jah\u00e1ng\u00edra to Sha\u00eddoh, 2 boats. In case of need, 8 or 12 boats can be procured from Attock. The only bridges over the river are at the city of K\u00e1b\u00fal, and have been described in the article on KABUL CITY.\u2014See also AFGHANISTAN.\n\nKachchh.\u2014Native State, Bombay.\u2014See Cutch.\n\nKachchh, Runn of.\u2014See Cutch.\n\nKachhandau.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Bilgr\u00e1m tahs\u00edl, Hardoi District, Oudh; bounded on the north and east by Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n pargan\u00e1; on the south by B\u00e1ngarmau pargan\u00e1 of Unao District; and on the west by the District of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d in the North-Western Provinces, the Ganges forming the boundary line. Originally in the possession of the Tha-theras, who were expelled by some Chandel subjects of the King of Kanauj. First constituted a pargan\u00e1 about 330 years ago by Sher Sh\u00e1h, who, on his proselytizing march from Jaunpur to Agra, compelled the inhabitants of several Chandel villages to apostatize. Their descendants now intermarry with the families of Ahbans, R\u00e1ikw\u00e1rs, and Gob\u00e9lw\u00e1rs, who were converted to Islam at the same time. The pargan\u00e1 forms part of the kachh or moist low-lying country along the bank of the Ganges, as opposed to the b\u00e1ngar or dry upland tract away from the river; hence its name Kachhandau. Area, 47 square miles, of which 28 are cultivated. Government land revenue, \u00a33378; average incidence, 4s. 11\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area, or 2s. 3\u00bdd. per acre of total area. Staple products\u2014barley, wheat, millet, rice, b\u00e1jra, gram, arhar, sugar-cane of an inferior quality. Of the 34 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 16 are owned by Hindu and 8 by Muhammadan Chandels. Of the remaining 10, Br\u00e1hmans hold 5; K\u00e1yasths, 2; and Panw\u00e1rs, Ah\u00edrs, and Cham\u00e1rs, 1 each. The prevailing tenure is that known as imperfect pattid\u00e1ri, which obtains in 18 villages; 15 are zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, and only 1 t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri. Population (1881) 20,137, namely, males 11,314, and females 8823; average density of population, 428 per square mile. This pargan\u00e1 is intersected by two unmetalled roads, and by cart tracks to three ferries on the Ganges. Owing to its liability to inundation, the climate is damp; and when floods are subsiding, fever is very prevalent.\n\nKachhi Baroda.\u2014Th\u00e1kurate and town in Badn\u00e1war pargan\u00e1 of Dh\u00e1r State of Bhop\u00e1war Agency, Central India. The th\u00e1kur or chief holds from the Dh\u00e1r Darb\u00e1r 16 villages under British guarantee, and pays an annual tribute of \u00a3966; his revenue is about \u00a33200. The town is situated 8 miles from Badn\u00e1war, the capital of the pargan\u00e1, and 40 miles from the town of Dh\u00e1r.\n\nKachhla.\u2014Town in Bud\u00e1un tahs\u00edl, Bud\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces, situated on the north or left bank of the Ganges, 18 miles from Bud\u00e1un town, where the imperial road from Bareli to H\u00e1thras\ncrosses the Ganges on a bridge of boats during the dry season. Agricultural produce is largely conveyed by road from Bareli and Bud\u00e1un by road to Kachhla, where it is shipped in boats for transfer to Cawnpur and Fatehgarh. Police station, post-office, opium storehouse, sard\u00ed or native inn, and encamping ground for troops. Market twice a week.\n\n**Kachola.** \u2014 Town in the Native State of Udaipur (Oodeypore), R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Head-quarters of the Kachola district, comprising the Mew\u00e1r estate of the chief of Sh\u00e1hpura. In former times the town, which apparently stood on the western bank of a large lake, must have been a place of some importance; for all around, to a considerable distance, the ground is strewn with fragments of sculpture of a superior character, and half-way up the hill the ruins of a temple are visible.\n\n**Kachu\u00e1.** \u2014 Village and police outpost station in Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated at the junction of the Bhairab and Madhumati rivers, about 6 miles east of B\u00e1gherh\u00e1t. Contains a considerable b\u00e1z\u00e1r; and is one of three market-places established in the Sundarbans by Mr. Henckell in 1782. A kh\u00e1l or creek, crossed by a masonry bridge, divides the villages into two parts. The place probably derives its name from kachu, a species of yam, which is grown here in great quantities.\n\n**Kadaba.** \u2014 T\u00e1luk in T\u00famk\u00far District, Mysore State, Southern India. Area, 498 square miles, of which 101 are cultivated. Population (1881) 68,158, namely, 32,541 males and 35,617 females; 65,203 were returned as Hindus, 2919 Muhammadans, and 36 Christians. Land revenue (1881\u201382), exclusive of water rates, \u00a39974, or 3s. per cultivated acre; total revenue, \u00a314,924. The t\u00e1luk is watered by the Shimsh\u00e1, which flows through it from north-east to south, forming large tanks at two places, Kadaba and Gubbi. Soil a red mould, shallow and gravelly. Near Dabbigh\u00e1ta some hills yielding black hornblende were formerly quarried for the pillars of temples, tombs, and public buildings. The t\u00e1luk contains 1 criminal court and 9 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); regular police, 75 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 336. The head-quarters of the t\u00e1luk are at GUBBI.\n\n**Kadaba.** \u2014 Village in T\u00famk\u00far District, Mysore State, Southern India; 18 miles south-west of T\u00famk\u00far town. Lat. 13\u00b0 14\u2032 50\u2033 N., long. 76\u00b0 53\u2032 20\u2033 E. Population (1881) 1679, including a settlement of Sr\u00ed Vaishnava Br\u00e1hmans. Boasts a mythical antiquity, its large tank, formed by a dam across the Shimsh\u00e1 river, being fabled to have been constructed by R\u00e1ma on his return from Lanka (Ceylon).\n\n**Kadaiyanall\u00far.** \u2014 Town in Tenk\u00e1si t\u00e1luk of Tinnevelly District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 9\u00b0 5\u2032 N., long. 77\u00b0 23\u2032 E. Population (1881) 7467; number of houses, 1854. A trading town on the road to Travancore, by the Achinkoil Pass. Police station.\nKadalur (K\u00faalal\u00edr).\u2014T\u00e1luk and town in South Arcot District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Cuddalore.\n\nKad\u00e1na.\u2014Native State in Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1nth\u00e1, Bombay Presidency. Kad\u00e1na is bounded on the north and east by Dungarpur, Mew\u00e1r State, on the south-east and south by Sunth, and on the south-west and west by Lun\u00e1 Wara and Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1nth\u00e1 States. Lat. $23^\\circ 16' 40''$ to $23^\\circ 30' 30''$ N., long. $73^\\circ 43'$ to $73^\\circ 54'$ E. Area, 130 square miles. Population (1872) 12,689; (1881) 14,220, namely, 7,322 males and 6,868 females. Kad\u00e1na is rugged, covered throughout with hills and forests. The M\u00e1hi river crosses the southern portion of the State. In the extreme south-west, on the left bank of the M\u00e1hi, the land is open and rich; but to the north, except a narrow fringe along the river bank, the country is barren and rocky. Kad\u00e1na is said to have been established as a separate power about the thirteenth century by Limdevji, younger brother of J\u00e1lamsingh, a descendant of J\u00e1lamsingh, the founder of the town of Jh\u00e1lod in the Panch Mah\u00e1ls. In spite of its small size, the wildness and poverty of the country have saved it from being swallowed up by any of its neighbours or from being forced to pay tribute to the paramount power. Estimated revenue, \u00a31000. The town of Kad\u00e1na is situated towards the south-east of the State on the left bank of the M\u00e1hi. Lat. $23^\\circ 21' 30''$ N., long. $73^\\circ 52'$ E.\n\nKadapa.\u2014District, t\u00e1luk, and town in Madras Presidency.\u2014See Cuddapah.\n\nKadattan\u00e1d (Kartinad).\u2014One of the ancient chieftainships (u\u00e1ds) into which Malabar District of the Madras Presidency was formerly divided; situated between $11^\\circ 36'$ and $11^\\circ 48'$ N. lat., and between $75^\\circ 36'$ and $75^\\circ 52'$ E. long.; stretching from the sea-coast up the western declivity of the Western Gh\u00e1ts. The level tracts near the sea are very fertile, but suffered to such an extent from the devastations of Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, that the people were unable to raise grain sufficient for their support. The eastern hilly parts are well wooded, and contain indigenous cardamom plants. The petty State was founded in 1564 by a Nair chief, who probably inherited it (in the male line) from the Tekkalank\u00far (Southern Regent) of the Kolattiri kingdom, and he and his successors ruled the country until the invasion of Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n.

Population (1881) 9876. Situated opposite J\u00e1lna, on the Kundalika stream. K\u00e1dir\u00e1b\u00e1d is a town of recent growth, and has a considerable trade in English manufactured goods and country produce.\u2014See J\u00e1lna.\n\nKadiri.\u2014T\u00e1luk in Cuddapah (Kadapa) District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 13\u00b0 48' 30\" to 14\u00b0 28' N., long. 77\u00b0 43' to 78\u00b0 31' 30\" E. The t\u00e1luk is irregular in shape, its extreme breadth being 35 miles, and its extreme length 45 miles. In the north is a rocky range of hills. Area, 1416 square miles, with 143 towns and villages, and 26,299 houses. Population (1881) 116,252, namely, 59,656 males and 56,596 females. Hindus numbered 106,967; Muhammadans, 9274; and Christians, 11. The climate is hot and unhealthy. The rivers and almost all the tanks are dry during the hot months. The wells are very deep, and four pair of bullocks are frequently used during the day for drawing the water. The t\u00e1luk contains 3188 wells and 423 tanks. The soil is poor, but patches of black soil are met with here and there. Generally the country is scattered over with rocks and boulders of disintegrated granite. There are six roads covering 128 miles. Five of the roads meet in the kusba or head-quarters town. Chief products\u2014rice, gram, cholam (great millet), sugar-cane, and cotton. The silk manufacture has been discontinued. Ironstone and granite are the minerals. Pasture is scanty and precarious. In 1883 there were 2 criminal courts; police stations, 14; and regular police, 110 men. Land revenue, \u00a312,241.\n\nKadiri.\u2014Town in Cuddapah (Kadapa) District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 14\u00b0 7' N., long. 78\u00b0 16' E. Population (1881) 5004, namely, 2471 males and 2533 females, occupying 1141 houses: Hindus numbered 3555; Muhammadans, 1443; and Christians, 6. Head-quarters of the Kadiri t\u00e1luk; dispensary; elementary school. There is a pagoda here, the dancing girls of which contribute towards keeping up the bad reputation of the town. The pagoda is resorted to by crowds of pilgrims in the beginning of the year. Kadiri must have been at one time a Muhammadan town, though the buildings show no signs of Muhammadan architecture, yet for two miles outside the town there are many tombs and mosques. The Muhammadan occupation must have been previous to the building of the pagoda, which appears more recent than the tombs.\n\nKa-do.\u2014Village in Amherst District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. Ka-do lies on the bank of the Gyaing, at the mouth of\nthe Ka-do creek, close to the junction of the Gyaing and the Salwin. The town is well laid out with brick-tiled streets shaded by trees. The Government timber station at which all logs brought down the Salwin are collected, and the duty on them paid. Population (1881) 2685. Within the jurisdiction of the Judge and Magistrate of Maulmain.\n\nKadur.\u2014District of Mysore State, Southern India. Kadur District forms the south-western portion of the Nagar Division of Mysore, and lies between 13\u00b0 12' and 13\u00b0 58' N. lat., and between 75\u00b0 8' and 76\u00b0 25' E. long. It is bounded on the west by the Western Ghats, which separate it from the District of Kanara in the Madras Presidency; on the north by Shimoga District (Mysore); on the east by the Chitaldrug District (Mysore); and on the south by Hassan District (Mysore). Area, 2984 square miles. Population (1881) 328,327. The administrative head-quarters are at Chikmagalur.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The larger portion of the District consists of the Malnad or highlands, which contains some of the wildest mountain scenery in Southern India. The frontier on the west is formed by the lofty chain of the ghats, of which the highest peaks are the Kudure-mukha (6215 feet) and the Meruti Gudda (5451 feet). The centre of the District is occupied by the horse-shoe range of the Baba Budans, which boasts the loftiest mountain in Mysore\u2014Mulaingiri\u2014rising to a height of 6317 feet above the sea. Companion heights of the same group are Baba Budan-giri (6214 feet) and Kalhatti-giri (6155 feet). There are many minor ranges; and the whole of the Malnad is broken into hills and valleys, which are alike covered with primeval forest, teeming with the characteristic fauna and flora of the tropics, and little disturbed by the invasion of man. The Maidan or plain country, lying towards the east, partakes of the general character of the Mysore plateau. The elevation slopes from 3400 to 2400 feet. The principal rivers of the District are the twin streams of the Tunga and the Bhadra, which rise near each other in the ghats, and, after a long separation, unite to form the Tungabhadra, itself a tributary of the Kistna. The Hemavati has its source in the south of the District, but almost immediately enters the District of Hassan. The eastern portion of Kadur District is watered by the river system of the Vedavati. Where this river leaves the Baba Budan Mountains, it is embanked to form two extensive tanks, which irrigate the lower valley. One of these tanks, four miles north-west of Sakraypatna, forms an expanse of water seven miles in circumference, dotted with islands. From all the rivers water is drawn off into irrigation channels by means of anicuts or weirs. The valley lying beneath the amphitheatre formed by the Baba Budan Hills is the most fertile portion of the District. It commands an unsailing supply of water from the hill streams, and the soil is the famous 'black cotton-soil.'\nAmong mineral products, iron is largely obtained and smelted along the foot of the hills, and corundum is found in certain localities. But the chief natural wealth of Kad\u00far lies in its forests, which contain some fine timber, and also furnish shelter for the coffee plantations. The highest mountains are precipitous, and bare of trees; but the slopes and the valleys are clothed with valuable timber, arranged in park-like clumps, between which stretch glades of luxuriant grass. Teak is abundant, especially in the Lakwalli t\u00e1luk, and sandal-wood is also found. About 78 square miles have been reserved as State forests, and trees are planted in avenues along the public roads. The eastern t\u00e1luks, on the other hand, hardly possess sufficient food for fuel. In the Malnad, wild animals are numerous. Wild elephants are occasionally seen, and bison abound. Beasts of prey include the tiger, leopard, and bear; and the shivanga or hunting leopard is found. Wild hog are very destructive to the crops, especially to plantations of sugar-cane. Deer and antelope are common. The flying squirrel, porcupine, and different varieties of the snake are everywhere met with. Fish are abundant in both rivers and tanks, and are caught by rod and line, by nets, and in long conical traps of bamboo. At certain sacred spots in the rivers they are fed daily by the priests, and are so tame as to rise to the surface at call.\n\nHistory.\u2014As containing the hallowed sources of the Tungabhadra, Kad\u00far District abounds with scenes associated with the legends of the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana. Sringeri or Rishya-sringa-giri, on the Tunga river, takes precedence of all other places in its claims to mythical antiquity. Here it was that the sage Rishya-sringa was born without a natural mother, by whose intervention alone could \u2018the horse sacrifice\u2019 be celebrated and R\u00e1ma himself be brought into the world. Here also, in historical times, was the home of Sankar\u00e1charya, the great Sivaite reformer of the 8th century; and here at the present day resides the jagat-guru or supreme high priest of the Smarta Br\u00e1hmans. The most ancient sites connected with local history are the ruins of Ratn\u00e1puri and of Saka-r\u00e1ya-patna, both of which are described as the capitals of powerful kings before the rise of the Ball\u00e1la dynasty. On the overthrow of the Ball\u00e1las by the Muhammadans, the Vijayanagar Empire established itself over all Southern India; but in this region, as in other outlying tracts, the Government really fell into the hands of feudatory chiefs, who asserted all the attributes of independence. The three leading families in Kad\u00far were those of Karkala, Aigur, and Tarikere. Subsequently the greater part of the District was overrun by the Ikkeri or Bedn\u00far p\u0101leg\u00e1r from the neighbouring District of Hassan, who was in his turn defeated in 1694 by the conquering Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Mysore.\n\nIt was not until 1763 that Haidar Al\u00ed finally incorporated the whole\ncountry in the Mysore dominions. In 1799, after the death of Tip\u00fa, Kad\u00far was restored to the Hindu kingdom then set up by the Marquis of Wellesley. But the memories of local independence were strong in this remote and wild country, and the abuses of the Br\u00e1hman officials provoked a general discontent both among the Ling\u00e1yats and the general body of the cultivators. In 1831, the people broke out into open insurrection, and found a natural leader in the representative of the old family of the Tarikere p\u0101leg\u0101rs, who was also joined by a large number of Thugs or professional stranglers. The insurgents seized upon several forts, and proved themselves too strong for the native government. In the early months of 1831, the insurrection was suppressed by a British force; and the inquiry that followed led to the assumption by the British of the direct administration of the entire State of Mysore. Kad\u00far was formed into a separate District in 1863; and two years later, Chikmagal\u00far was fixed upon as the civil station in place of Kad\u00far town, though the District retains its original name.\n\nPopulation.\u2014In 1838, a report by Mr. Stokes estimated the population of the District, which was then much smaller in extent, at 145,394 persons; and a kh\u00e1na-sum\u00e1ri house enumeration in 1853\u201354 returned a total for the present area of 236,178. The regular Census of 1871 ascertained the number to be 333,925, showing a comparative increase of 88 per cent. in the interval of thirty-three years, and of 41 per cent. in the latter period of eighteen years, if the earlier estimates can be trusted. The Census of 1881 showed a total population for the District of 328,327, or a decrease of 5598 since 1871. This decrease is due to the mortality caused by the famine of 1876\u201378. The area of the District is 2984 square miles, showing, when compared with population, an average of 110 persons per square mile. Classified according to sex, there are 169,668 males and 158,659 females; proportion of males, 51 per cent. There are, under 15 years of age, 60,943 boys and 56,728 girls; total, 117,671, or 35\u00b78 per cent. of the District population. Of the 1373 towns and villages in Kad\u00far District in 1881, 837 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 385 from two to five hundred; 126 from five hundred to a thousand; 17 from one to two thousand; 5 from two to three thousand; 1 from three to five thousand; and 2 from five to ten thousand. The Census classifies the male population according to occupation into the following six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every description and the learned professions, 5354; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 2260; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 4117; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 86,688; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 6995; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising\ngeneral labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 64,254.\n\nThe religious division of the people shows:\u2014Hindus, 313,290, or 95\u00b74 per cent.; Muhammadans, 13,789, or 4 per cent.; Christians, 1245; and \u2018others,\u2019 3. The Br\u00e1hmans number 16,004, almost exclusively belonging to the Smarta sect of Hindus, whose head-quarters are at the sacred village of Sringeri; those claiming the rank of Kshattriya are returned at 518, including 453 R\u00e1jputs. Komatis, who form the bulk of the trading castes, number 1252; agricultural castes, including 21,649 Ling\u00e1yats, are returned at 183,478. The Ling\u00e1yats have always been influential in this part of the country. Out-castes are returned at 62,020; wandering tribes, 13,506; non-Hindu aboriginal castes and tribes, 62. The Musalm\u00e1ns, who muster strongest in the t\u00e1luk of Lakwalli, are almost exclusively of the Sunni sect; there are only 307 Shi\u00e1s. Out of the total of 1245 Christians, 84 are Europeans (mostly residing on the coffee plantations), and 92 are Eurasians, leaving 1069 for the native converts. According to another principle of classification, there are 182 Protestants and 1063 Roman Catholics.\n\nThe District contains 1373 primary (asali) populated towns and villages, with 60,883 occupied and 11,303 unoccupied houses. As compared with the area and the population, these figures yield the following averages:\u2014Villages per square mile, 46; houses per square mile, 24\u00b72; persons per village, 239; persons per occupied house, 5\u00b739. The only towns in the District with more than 5000 inhabitants are Chikmagalur and Tarikere. The latter was the residence of an old line of palegars, of whom the last representative was executed for rebellion in 1834. Chikmagalur, the head-quarters of the District, has 7088 inhabitants; Tarikere, 5266; Kadur, the old civil station, 2193. Other places of more or less importance in the District are\u2014Ajimpur, a cotton centre; Ayyankere, with a magnificent reservoir; Ban\u00e1var, a village in a t\u00e1luk that was once a small Jain State, but since 1875 the head-quarters of Ban\u00e1var t\u00e1luk as enlarged by the addition of Kadur t\u00e1luk; Birur, a centre for the areca-nut trade; Hariharpur; Hiremagalur, a village in which stands a spear-headed stone pillar, said to be efficacious in restoring any one bitten by a serpent; Kalasa, the vicinity of which produces the finest areca-nut in Mysore; and Koppa. The most interesting sites in the District are to be found on the Baba Budan range of hills, where the primeval forest is now dotted with trim coffee plantations. These hills derive their name from B\u00e1ba Budan, a Musalm\u00e1n saint, who is said to have first introduced the coffee plant into India from Mecca. His tomb is guarded by a Muhammadan custodian, and is placed in a cave associated with Hindu legends. At Kalhatti, on the B\u00e1ba Budan hills, is the hot-weather retreat for the European officials from all the neighbouring\nDistricts. The sacred village of Sringeri, on the Tunga river, has already been referred to.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The staple food-crop of the District is rice, of which fourteen different varieties are enumerated. It is principally grown on the slopes of the Malnad or hill country, where the natural rainfall is sufficient, and in the river valleys, where the fields can be irrigated from tanks and artificial canals. There are altogether 8740 tanks in the District; and 115 anicuts or dams across the several rivers, irrigating an area of 4928 acres, with a revenue of \u00a36128. The average rent per acre for land suitable for rice is (1880-81) 8s.; for wheat, 4s.; for cotton, 2s.; for sugar-cane, 8s. The produce of land per acre in 1880-81 was\u2014rice, 1143 lbs.; wheat, 1428; cotton, 280; sugar-cane, 1400. The principal 'dry' crop is ragi (Eleusine corocana), which is preferred as food by the natives to rice as affording more sustenance. The areca-nut palm flourishes in the moist and sheltered valleys throughout the west.\n\nBut the main source of agricultural wealth in Kadur is derived from coffee. The berry is locally stated to have been first introduced by the Muhammadan saint, Baba Budan, about two centuries ago, who planted it after his return from a pilgrimage to Mecca on the hills, which are still the head-quarters of the cultivation. European capital was not attracted to the enterprise until about 1840, but there are now 90,000 acres planted with coffee. The coffee zone extends over an area of about 1000 square miles, and about one-tenth of this is excellently adapted to the cultivation in respect of soil, aspect, and shade. The statistics for 1875 show a total of 12,376 plantations, owned by 22 Europeans and 4760 natives, with about forty-four million plants. Most native cultivators in this tract possess a few coffee plants at the back of their houses. The returns for 1883 show a total of 23,090 plantations, covering an area of 139,707 acres, yielding approximately 4,955,076 lbs., or 2212 tons of the berry, valued at about \u00a3149,140. The plantations owned by Europeans numbered 486, covering 41,237 acres, yielding approximately 2,279,540 lbs., or 1018 tons, valued at \u00a375,092. Those owned by the natives numbered 22,604, covering 98,470 acres, yielding 2,675,536 lbs., or 1194 tons, valued at \u00a374,048. The Mysore Government has recently abolished the halat, or tax on coffee, and levies instead from the planters a light land-tax varying from 1s. 8d. to 2s. 6d. an acre. This measure, while securing a fair revenue to Government, has conferred on the planters a better tenure, and induced an improvement of their estates.\n\nSeveral attempts have been made to introduce the tea plant, but hitherto without success. Efforts to extend the growth of mulberry and of foreign cotton have been equally unsuccessful. The cardamom grows wild in the Malnad, and its systematic cultivation has\nrecently been undertaken by coffee planters. There is a Government plantation of cinchona (the quinine plant) at Kalh\u00e1tti, on the B\u00e1ba Budan Hills.\n\nThe following agricultural statistics are approximate:\u2014Out of the total area of 2984 square miles in 1880\u201381, 614 square miles were returned as under cultivation, and 376 more as cultivable. There were (1875) under rice, 42,646 acres; wheat, 2500; other food-grains, 70,000; oil-seeds, 3000; sugar-cane, 443; cotton, 300; tobacco, 6500; cocoa-nut and areca-nut, 7800; coffee, 60,000; tea, 2. The agricultural stock consisted of 5924 carts and 45,700 ploughs. The cattle of the District are generally small and of an inferior breed. The climate of the Maln\u00e1d or hill country is very fatal to them, and buffaloes are bred on the plains to be imported into that tract. The returns show a total of 281,963 cows and bullocks, and 86,205 sheep and goats. No later agricultural returns than those quoted are available.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The chief articles of local manufacture are coarse cotton cloth, kambl\u00eds or rough blankets, oil and oil-cake. Jaggery is also largely made from sugar-cane in certain tracts, and there is a considerable production of iron. Arrack and other spirituous liquors are distilled. A certain amount of catechu or Terra japonica is made, and a little salt. The returns of manufacturing stock show 2000 weaving looms and 115 oil-mills.\n\nThe statistics of trade appear to be more accurately kept than in other Districts of Mysore. The total of the annual exports was (1876) valued at \u00a3297,000, chiefly destined for D\u00e1vangere and Bangalore; the imports were valued at \u00a3217,000, of which the greater part came from Bangalore and Hassan. The external trade passes by 31 recognised kanaves or passes, the most frequented being those of Biranhalli and Jodikatte for wheeled carts, and Tallagudde and Talmakki for pack-bullocks. A considerable proportion of commodities is still conveyed on the heads of coolies. The interchange of goods between the highlands and lowlands of the District is very brisk. It is estimated that \u00a3124,800 worth of dry grain, fine rice, piece-goods, kambl\u00eds, etc. annually passes along five kanaves leading from the Maid\u00e1n into the Maln\u00e1d; and that \u00a3230,000 worth of paddy, areca-nut, cardamoms, pepper, coffee, etc. is carried in the reverse direction. Statistics for 1880 estimate the value of the manufactures at \u00a377,617. The largest weekly markets are held at the towns of Chikmagal\u00far, Birur, and Tarikere, and at the village of Koppa; the most frequented annual fair is connected with the Nava-ratri at Sringeri. The most numerously attended religious festivals are the following:\u2014Sringeri, Pura, Antar-gatte, K\u00e1rahalli, and Hoshalli. The total length of State roads in the District is 245 miles, maintained at an annual cost of \u00a34005; of District roads, 348 miles, costing \u00a31820.\nAdministration.\u2014In 1880-81, the total revenue of Kadur District amounted to \u00a373,563. The chief items were\u2014land revenue, \u00a369,167; s\u00e1yar or customs, \u00a320,806; \u00e1kk\u00e1ri or excise, \u00a36247. The District is divided into 6 taluks or fiscal divisions, which have, however, recently undergone alteration. In 1870-71, the total number of estates on the register was 62,462. During 1880, the average daily prison population of the District jail was 30\u00b779, and of the taluk lock-ups, 3; total, 33\u00b779, of whom 1\u00b788 were women. In the same year, the District police numbered 50 officers and 525 men, and the municipal police 2 officers and 15 men; total, 592 men of all ranks, maintained at an aggregate cost of \u00a36271. These figures show 1 policeman to every 5 square miles of existing area or to every 554 persons of the present population, the cost being \u00a32, 2s. 3d. per square mile. The number of schools aided and inspected by Government in 1874 was 176, attended by 3027 pupils, being 1 school to every 16\u00b79 square miles of the present area, and 1 pupil to every thousand of the population. In addition, there were, in 1874, 121 unaided schools, with 1235 pupils.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Kadur District offers a great variety of climate. At the station of Chikmagalur, the mean annual temperature is 78\u00b0 F.; during 1880, the maximum recorded was 99\u00b0 in May, the hottest month of the year; the minimum was 56\u00b76\u00b0. The heat in Kadur would often be excessive, if it were not for the breezes that blow from the mountains on the west and the north. The east winds, on the other hand, exercise an unhealthy influence, and it has been found necessary to shelter the town with a wide belt of trees. In the Malnad the temperature falls much lower, and the cold at night about Christmas-time is very sharp. The rainfall of the District is variable, owing to the same geographical causes. The average at Chikmagalur during the twelve years ending 1881 was only 32\u00b783 inches; whereas at certain coffee plantations in the Malnad from 100 to 170 inches have been registered in a single year.\n\nIn the Malnad, malarious or jungle fevers are always prevalent at certain seasons of the year, from which neither Europeans nor natives are exempt. In the plains, the violent east winds are dreaded as promoting disease. The vital statistics are far from trustworthy; but it may be mentioned that, out of the total of 6357 deaths reported in 1880, 4187 were assigned to fevers, 828 to bowel complaints, 19 to small-pox, and 18 to snake-bite and wild beasts. In 1880, the dispensary at Chikmagalur was attended by 216 in-patients, of whom 22 died; the out-patients numbered 6984. There are also dispensaries at Kadur and Hariharpur.\n\nKadur.\u2014Once a taluk in Kadur District, Mysore State, Southern India, but now absorbed into Banavar. The taluk contained 1 criminal\ncourt and 6 police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); regular police, 71 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 391. Land revenue demand (1883\u201384), \u00a314,311.\n\nKad\u00far ('Elk Town').\u2014Village in Kad\u00far District, Mysore State, Southern India. Lat. 13\u00b0 33' N., long. 76\u00b0 2' 45\" E. Population (1881) 2193; situate 15 miles north-west of Chikmagal\u00far on the Bangalore-Shimoga road. Inscriptions and other monuments show that there was a settlement of Jains here in the 10th century. Subsequently a fort was built by a local chieftain. In 1863, the District of Kad\u00far was formed, and two years afterwards the head-quarters were removed from Kad\u00far to Chikmagal\u00far. Till 1875 the head-quarters of Kad\u00far t\u00e1luk, now absorbed into Ban\u00e1var t\u00e1luk.\n\nKaf\u00e1ra.\u2014Town in Kheri District, Oudh; situated east of the Dahraura river, on the high bank of an ancient channel of the stream. Soil very fertile and drainage good. Population (1869) 2467; in 1881, 4031, of whom 3573 were Hindus and 458 Muhammadans. Land revenue, \u00a3341.\n\nK\u00e1f\u00edrist\u00e1n.\u2014Tract of country lying between the north-western frontier of India and the Hindu K\u00fash Mountains. On the west the country of the K\u00e1f\u00edrs is bordered by Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, the boundary line being the Al\u00edshang river; on the east the line of the Kun\u00e1r river may be taken as the limit. Several descriptions of the tract and its people have been published; and writers like Elphinstone, Burnes, Masson, Raverty, and Lumsden give highly-coloured accounts, based on the tales of Muhammadan tribesmen who occupy the adjoining region. But, as a matter of fact, the country is particularly difficult of access to Muhammadans, for no K\u00e1f\u00edr is in his own neighbourhood thought to be of any consideration unless he has managed during his life to slay at least one follower of Isl\u00e1m; and until 1883 no European had penetrated K\u00e1f\u00edrist\u00e1n. Consequently the statements of Orientals concerning the S\u00ed\u00e1hposh, who inhabit K\u00e1f\u00edrist\u00e1n, have to be accepted for the various theories and descriptions current about a people always regarded by Europeans in a light more or less curious and mysterious.\n\nSome writers assign the origin of the S\u00ed\u00e1hposh K\u00e1f\u00edrs to an Arab tribe whose customs closely correspond to those of the Gabars of Persia. Others have wildly conjectured them to be the descendants of the Greek soldiers of Alexander, who were left behind in the country. Lumsden believes them to be aborigines of the Indian plains driven to the mountains they inhabit, as refugees before Moslem fanaticism. The K\u00e1f\u00edr dialect, however, is said to have no affinity with either Arabic, Persian, or Turk\u00ed, but to be allied to Sanskrit; and for this reason among others later writers think it probable that the K\u00e1f\u00edrs have no single genealogical descent or well-defined tribal divisions like the Arabs or\nthe Afghans, but are valley communities, topographical rather than ethnographical in their origin.\n\nMasson mentions the following names of villages:\u2014Katt\u00e1r, Gamb\u00edr, Delh\u00falz, Arans, Ishurma, Amisoz, Pundit, and W\u00e1igal. He makes no attempt to estimate the total population; but he is probably right in giving the numbers of the village populations as ranging between one and six thousand. An estimate, however, was roughly made in 1883. In April of that year, Mr. W. W. M'Nair, of the Indian Survey Department, paid a visit of two months\u2019 duration to the country, and he sets down the total number of the people at 600,000. Mr. M'Nair is believed to be the first European who has succeeded in penetrating the region.\n\nThe character and appearance of the S\u00ed\u00e1hposh K\u00e1firs have been variously delineated, and particulars more or less reliable as to their daily habits and modes of life are available. The general idea about the S\u00ed\u00e1hposh, and probably a correct one, is that they are a hardy, strong, and daring race of mountaineers, rather undersized as are most hillmen, extremely lazy, fond of pleasure, and constant wine-drinkers. Lumsden, who knew the K\u00e1fir general Faramosh Kh\u00e1n, at Kandah\u00e1r, and who came into contact with several K\u00e1firs who had been kidnapped and were slaves in the houses of Afghan chiefs, says \u2018the K\u00e1firs are physically athletic, powerful men, leading an indolent, jovial life.\u2019 Raverty on hearsay assigns to them a European cast of feature, blue as well as dark eyes, and the lighter shades of hair; and to the females exceptional beauty and intelligence. Wood remarked that the K\u00e1firs, unlike all other Eastern races, are unable to sit cross-legged on the ground, and prefer a chair, such as are seen in the Laghm\u00e1n\u00ed dwellings, or indeed any form of support. Many travellers appear to have had an impression that the K\u00e1fir presented some of the characteristics of the Saxon type. The impression is not borne out by experience; and Dr. Trumpp describes three K\u00e1firs sent to him by Colonel Lumsden for enlistment in the Guide Corps, as in no material way differing from the natives of the Upper Provinces of India. Their faces, Dr. Trumpp admits, were more reddish, but that he attributes to the great quantity of wine they were in the habit of consuming. Being asked as to what they wished to eat and drink, they returned the answer \u2018a massak of wine a day.\u2019 A massak of wine would be equivalent to about six English gallons.\n\nMr. M'Nair describes the people of K\u00e1firist\u00e1n as of good appearance and brave, but leaving all agricultural work in the orchards which everywhere abound, to the women of the tribe. They are, Mr. M'Nair says, passionately fond of dancing, and most of their evenings are spent in this amusement. Mr. M'Nair adds:\u2014\u2018It is purely owing to their having no blood-feuds among themselves that they hold their own against the Muhammadans, who hem them in\non all sides, and with whom they are always fighting. Towards the British they are exceedingly well disposed. Slavery exists to a certain extent among them, but the trade in slaves would soon die out if human flesh were not so saleable at Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, Kun\u00e1r, Asmar, and Chitr\u00e1l. Polygamy is rare; mild corporal punishment is inflicted on a wife for adultery, while the male offender is fined so many heads of cattle. The dead are coffined, but never buried. One Supreme Being\u2014Imbra\u2014is universally acknowledged. Priests preside at their temples, in which sacred stones are set up, but to neither priests nor idols is excessive reverence paid. In evil spirits, authors of ill-luck, the K\u00e1f\u00edrs firmly believe. Their arms are bows and arrows; a few matchlocks have found their way among them from K\u00e1b\u00fal, but no attempts have been made to imitate them. Wealth is reckoned by heads of cattle. There are 18 chiefs in all, chosen for bravery mainly, but with some regard to hereditary claims.\n\nAmong the ordinary and extraordinary customs pertaining to the S\u00ed\u00e1hposh K\u00e1f\u00edrs, and selected now at random from the writings of earlier authors, are the following:\n\nThe K\u00e1f\u00edrs hold themselves to be firmly bound by an oath. Before breaking a truce, a brace of bullets, or an arrow, is sent as a significant hint of future intentions. When a guest has crossed the threshold of a K\u00e1f\u00edr\u2019s house, the master of the house alone has the privilege of waiting on him; should another inhabitant entice away the stranger a deadly feud will probably ensue. Women go uncovered, and wander where they will: they are not allowed to eat at the same table with the men. Special buildings are set apart in every village for the lying-in of women. Enmities constantly arise among the K\u00e1f\u00edrs, but the most bitter quarrel may be settled by one of the parties kissing the nipple of his antagonist\u2019s breast as being typical of drinking of the milk of friendship; the other party to the quarrel kisses the suitor on the head, and an everlasting friendship is entered into. It is said that K\u00e1f\u00edrs do not sell their children to Muhammadans, but that when in distress they may sell their servant or the child of a neighbour kidnapped for the purpose. Major Biddulph, on the other hand, alleges that sale is frequent, and that the Chitr\u00e1l ruler annually receives a tribute of children of both sexes. When a K\u00e1f\u00edr crusade against the adjacent Muhammadans is decided upon, no individual of the expeditionary party either sleeps or eats in his own dwelling, but in whatever other house he happens to be until all the plans of the raid are matured. When the party arrives at the scene where the work is to be done, they separate into companies of two and three, and wait in ambush for the object of attack. When evening falls, they reunite and tell the exploits of the day. Moslem reprisals consist of incursions into the K\u00e1f\u00edrist\u00e1n valleys for the purpose of kidnapping the inhabitants.\nBread is the staple article of food; made of wheat, barley, and millet, ground in a handmill, and converted into cakes or bannocks by being kneaded and then baked on an iron dish suspended over a fire. Cattle are slaughtered by severing the head at one blow from the neck. Should more blows of the long, sharp knife be necessary, the carcase is considered impure, and is handed over to the Pariah caste of B\u00e1ris.\n\nTwo kinds of K\u00e1fir wine are drunk, coloured according to the hue of the grape from which they are pressed. None but children are permitted to touch the vines before a certain season. When the proper period arrives, the entire population set to work to secure the vintage. The Emperor B\u00e1bar notes that, 'so prevalent is the use of wine among them, that every K\u00e1fir has a \"khig\" or leathern bottle of wine about his neck.' 'They drink wine,' B\u00e1bar adds, 'instead of water.'\n\nNo complete investigation has been made by any European of the country of the K\u00e1firs. The safest way of entering their territory is to obtain beforehand the promise of some K\u00e1fir as security. If this precaution be adopted, the stranger may travel without apprehension; otherwise he is almost certain to be attacked. Pedlars, passed into the country by one of the K\u00e1fir inhabitants, make annual visits to the Si\u00e1hposh valleys, distributing the merchandise which they have purchased in Pesh\u00e1war.\n\nK\u00e1firkot.\u2014Ruins in Dera Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n District, Punjab. Lat. 32\u00b0 30' 15\" N., long. 71\u00b0 22' 45\" E. Those known as Til K\u00e1firkot or R\u00e1j\u00e1s\u00edr-kot are situated a few miles to the south of the point where the Kuram river joins the Indus, upon a spur of the Khisor Hills, and consist of immense blocks of smoothly chiselled stone, with remains of Hindu temples or sanctuaries. The carvings represent idols and other designs, and retain their freshness to a considerable degree. The ruin specially known as K\u00e1firkot lies on the left bank of the Indus, and is similar in character to the others, but smaller and less perfectly preserved. For full details, see General Cunningham's Archaeological Survey Report, vol. xiv. p. 254.\n\nK\u00e1g\u00e1l.\u2014Native State, subordinate to Kolh\u00e1pur, under the South Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Political Agency, Bombay Presidency. Watered by the Dudhgang\u00e1 and Vedgang\u00e1 rivers. Area, 129 square miles. Population (1881) 49,064. Annual gross revenue, \u00a321,196. Pays a yearly tribute of \u00a3200 to Kolh\u00e1pur, of which it is one of the most important feudatories. The present chief (1882), J\u00e1ya Singh R\u00e1o, Gh\u00e1tge Sarjar\u00e1o Waz\u00e1r\u00e1t M\u00e1\u00e1b, a Hindu of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 caste, is grandson by adoption of Hindu R\u00e1o, who held a leading position at Gwalior eighty years ago, and whose father (Sakh\u00e1r\u00e1m R\u00e1o), by means of his influence at the court of Sindhia, acquired in 1800 a grant of K\u00e1g\u00e1l from the Kolh\u00e1pur chief. He administers his own estate, and has been made Regent of Kolh\u00e1pur, with a salute of 9 guns, so long as he\nholds that office. His family has no sanad authorizing adoption; succession follows the rule of primogeniture. Retinue, 41 armed police and militia; schools, 10, with (1882) 697 pupils.\n\nK\u00e1gal.\u2014Chief town of K\u00e1gal State, Kolh\u00e1pur, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 16\u00b0 34' N., long. 74\u00b0 20' 30\" E.; 10 miles south-east of Kolh\u00e1pur. Population (1881) 6371, namely, Hindus, 5414; Muhammadans, 588; Jains, 368; 'others,' 1.\n\nK\u00e1g\u00e1n.\u2014Mountain valley in Haz\u00e1r\u00e1 District, Punjab, penetrating far into the heart of the Him\u00e1layan system, and surrounded by Kashmir territory on every side except the south. Area, 800 square miles; 60 miles in length, with an average breadth of 15 miles. Lofty ranges shut it in on either hand, their summits rising to a height of nearly 17,000 feet. Transverse spurs intersect the interior; and a thin population inhabit the glen. The K\u00e1g\u00e1n range comprises 22 rakhs or forest and grazing reserves, with an area varying from 116 acres to 8776 acres, the total area of which is 87,487 acres, or 89\u00b78 square miles. Total area of reserved and unreserved forest, 457 square miles. The rights of cutting grass and grazing cattle are let out annually. The Government Forest Department only fells timber, which is launched into the river Kunh\u00e1r, caught at the different timber dep\u00f4ts, and rafted to Jehlam, where it is sold by the Department. Through a narrow central gorge the river Kunh\u00e1r forces its way to join the Jehlam (Jhelum), after draining the entire valley. The K\u00e1g\u00e1n valley forms the northernmost extension of British India, and stretches like an intrusive arm far up into the mountain region. Its open mouth turns towards the main body of Haz\u00e1r\u00e1 District and the Murree (Marri) Hills. The inhabitants consist almost entirely of Muhammadan Sw\u00e1tis and Guj\u00e1rs. K\u00e1g\u00e1n village is situated in lat. 34\u00b0 46' 45\" N., long. 75\u00b0 34' 15\" E.\n\nKahan (or Gahan).\u2014River or torrent in Jehlam (Jhelum) District, Punjab; rises in the Salt Range, on the southern side of its northern spur, and, running nearly due east, passes through the southern or Tilla spur near Roht\u00e1s, falling into the Jehlam about 2 miles above Jehlam city.\n\nKahlg\u00e1on.\u2014Town in Bh\u00e1galpur District, Bengal.\u2014See COLGONG.\n\nKahl\u00far (Bil\u00e1spur).\u2014One of the Simla Hill States under the political superintendence of the Punjab Government, lying between 31\u00b0 12' 35\" and 31\u00b0 35' 45\" N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 26' and 76\u00b0 58' E. long. Area 448 square miles, with 1073 villages and 9626 houses; number of families, 18,600. Total population (1881) 86,546, namely, males 47,133, and females 39,413; average density, 189 persons per square mile. Hindus number 85,280; Muhammadans, 1263; and Sikhs, 3. The Gurkh\u00e1s, who had overrun the country at the beginning of the present century, were driven out by the British in 1815, and the R\u00e1ja was reinstated in his possessions of Bil\u00e1spur. In 1847-48, when\nthe Punjab was conquered, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was confirmed in possession of the territory of Kahl\u00far, including part of a tract on the right bank of the Sutlej (Satlaj), which he had previously held on terms of allegiance and payment of tribute to the Sikhs. The British Government waived its right to tribute, but required the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to abolish transit duties in his dominions. Subsequently, about 1865, the pargan\u00e1 of Basse Bachertu was given up to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, on condition of an annual payment of \u00a3800 to the British Government. In acknowledgment of his services during the Mutiny, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 received a dress of honour of the value of \u00a3500, and a salute of 7 guns, since increased to 11 guns. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Hira Ch\u00e1nd, a R\u00e1jput by caste, was born about 1835, and after a reign of 32 years, died in October 1882, on his way back to his own territory after a visit to Simla. He was succeeded by his son Amar Ch\u00e1nd, the present R\u00e1j\u00e1 (1883). Revenue about \u00a38600. Principal products\u2014grain, opium, and ginger. Sentences of death passed by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 require the confirmation of the Superintendent of the Hill States; other punishments are awarded by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 on his own authority.\n\n**Kahnuw\u00e1n.**\u2014Swampy lake (jh\u00edl) in Gurd\u00e1spur tahsil, Gurd\u00e1spur District, Punjab; lying south-east of Gurd\u00e1spur town, below the high bank of the Beas (Bi\u00e1s), and evidently marking an ancient course of that river. It is 9 miles in length, by 2000 feet in width; depth from 12 to 20 feet in the deepest parts. In the centre stands a pavilion, erected by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Sher Singh. Rice and singh\u00e1ra, or water nut (Trapa bispinosa), are cultivated in the shallows. A dam, 13 miles in length, erected to prevent flooding, has saved large portions of the surrounding country from inundation. Steps have been taken with success for draining the swampy area, by which 1100 acres of marsh land have already been reclaimed, and the process still continues at the rate of about 150 acres yearly. The lake formerly swelled to much larger dimensions, but the dam now confines the water of the Beas to a narrower bed.\n\n**Kahr\u00f3r (Karor).**\u2014Town and municipality in Mailsi tahsil, Mult\u00e1n (Mooltan) District, Punjab. Lat. 29\u00b0 37' N., long. 71\u00b0 57' 41\" E. Situated on an old bed of the Beas (Bi\u00e1s), known as the Bhati\u00e1ri n\u00e1la, about 8 miles from the present right bank of the Sutlej (Satlaj). Ancient town, the legendary scene of Vikram\u00e1ditya's victory over the Saka or Scythian invaders in the 1st century B.C. Captured by Chach after the fall of Mult\u00e1n in the 7th century. Population (1868) 5069; in 1881, 4804, namely, Hindus, 2967; Muhammadans, 1832; and Sikhs, 5; number of houses, 848. Municipal income (1881-82), \u00a3358, nearly all derived from octroi duties; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 6d. per head. The town, which is built on an undulating site, consists chiefly of brick houses. Kahr\u00f3r is the commercial centre\nof the southern half of Mult\u00e1n District, and has a fine broad b\u00e1\u017e\u00e1r running east and west. It contains two schools, police station, dispensary, and rest-house.\n\n**Kah\u00fata.**\u2014Eastern tahsil of R\u00e1wal Pindi District, Punjab, lying between $33\u00b019'$ and $33\u00b047'$ N. lat., and between $73\u00b018'$ and $73\u00b041'$ E. long.; partly in the tract known as the Murree (Marri) Hills. The Narh Mountain, rising to a height of 6000 feet, is situated in the north-east corner of the tahsil. The northern and eastern tracts are mountainous, the remainder resembles the plain tahsils in character. Area, 434 square miles. Population (1881) 87,210, namely, males 46,188, and females 41,022; average density of population, 201 persons per square mile. Classified according to religion, Muhammadans numbered 77,563; Hindus, 6201; Sikhs, 3364; and 'others,' 82. Number of houses, 13,622; families, 21,308. Of the 226 villages in the tahsil, 185 contain less than five hundred inhabitants; 24 from five hundred to a thousand; 12 from one to two thousand; and 5 from two to five thousand. The average annual area under the principal crops for the five years ending 1881-82 is returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 24,194 acres; b\u00e1jra, 19,945 acres; Indian corn, 10,945 acres; moth, 3499 acres; barley, 2064 acres; and cotton, 3209 acres. The revenue of the tahsil in 1882-83 was \u00a36896. The administrative staff consists of a t\u00e1s\u00edld\u00e1r and a mun\u00edsif, who preside over 1 criminal and 2 civil courts. Number of police circles (th\u00e1\u0144ds), 2; strength of regular police, 606 men; rural police or village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 1057.\n\n**Kaidala** ('The Restored Hand').\u2014Village in T\u00famk\u00far District, Mysore State, Southern India; situated 3 miles south of T\u00famk\u00far town. Lat. $13\u00b018'$ N., long. $77\u00b08'$ E. Population (1881) 454. Said to have been formerly called Krid\u00e1pura, and the capital of a powerful State; also regarded as the birthplace of Jakan\u00e1ch\u00e1ri, the great architect and sculptor, to whom all the temple carving in Mysore is attributed. The two temples at Kaidala, now in ruins, belong to the period of the Ball\u00e1la dynasty (10th to 14th centuries). Tradition relates that Jakan\u00e1ch\u00e1ri, on being informed that there was a defect in one of the images of the Chennakesava temple in course of construction at Bel\u00far, vowed to cut off his right hand should any blemish be found. A cavity was discovered, and he kept his vow. Subsequently he was directed in a vision to dedicate a temple to the god Kesava in Krid\u00e1pura, his native place. No sooner was this temple completed than his hand was restored, and in commemoration of this incident the village has ever since been called Kaidala.\n\n**Kail.**\u2014Ancient port in Tinnevelli District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Kay\u00e1l.\n\n**Kailang** (Kilang, Kyelang).\u2014Village in the L\u00e1hul Sub-division of\nK\u00e1ngra District, Punjab; situated in lat. $32^\\circ 34' 15''$ N., and long. $77^\\circ 4'$ E., on the main trade route between the Rohtang and B\u00e1ra L\u00e1cha Passes, on the right bank of the river Bh\u00e1ga, about 4 miles above its junction with the Chandra. A station of the Moravian Mission has been established in the village for several years past, and a post-office is maintained during the summer months. A Government school was formerly managed by the missionaries, but they have now entirely ceased their connection with it, in consequence of the hostile feeling which it excited in the minds of the natives.\n\n**Kail\u00e1s.**\u2014A sacred mountain of the Hindus in the inner Him\u00e1layas, near the source of the Indus and Sutlej, beyond British territory. Height, 20,226 feet. Kail\u00e1s lies to the north-west of the M\u00e1nasarowar Lake in Tibet, and is famous in Sanskrit literature as Siva's paradise. Its distance, however, prevents it from being largely resorted to by pilgrims; although it is still a favourite retreat of Hindu hermits, who like to end their days on Kail\u00e1s.\u2014See article MANASAROWAR.\n\n**Kail\u00e1shahr.**\u2014Sub-division of Hill Tipperah State, Bengal. Population (1881) 22,238, namely, males 12,060, and females 10,178. Hindus number 3452; Muhammadans, 4348; Christians, 3; and aboriginal tribes, 14,435.\n\n**Kail\u00e1shahr.**\u2014Town and head-quarters of Kail\u00e1shahr Sub-division, in Hill Tipperah State, Bengal. Prettily situated at the foot of a low range of hills, in lat. $24^\\circ 19' 10''$ N., long. $92^\\circ 2' 15''$ E. The town contains a magistrate's and munsif's court, jail, b\u00e1z\u00e1r, dispensary, and school. A military guard is stationed at Cherak\u00fat\u00ed, two miles from the town.\n\n**Kailw\u00e1r\u00e1.**\u2014Town in the Native State of Udaip\u00far (Oodeypore), R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Kailw\u00e1r\u00e1 lies in the heart of the Aravalli mountains, once the great refuge of the R\u00e1jputs, and is situated below the hill fort of Kumalgarh, on the western frontier of the State. It was to Kailw\u00e1r\u00e1 that R\u00e1n\u00e1 Ajeysi, the survivor of the twelve R\u00e1jput princes, eleven of whom sacrificed themselves to save the royal line of Chittur, is said to have escaped when the Path\u00e1n Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn sacked that city.\n\n**K\u00e1imahr\u00e1.**\u2014Village in Kheri District, Oudh; situated on the road from Lakhimpur via Muhamdi to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ mile east of the Jamw\u00e1ri river, and surrounded on all sides by groves of mango trees. The property of the K\u00e1imahr\u00e1 t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r, and the head-quarters of his estate. Population (1881) 1569, namely, Hindus, 1293, and Muhammadans, 276. Land revenue, \u00a3132. Large artificial tank, 4 Hindu temples, and 10 mosques. Four sugar manufactories, good market, and vernacular school.\n\n**K\u00e1imganj.**\u2014North-western tahs\u00edl of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the southern bank of the Ganges, and\ncomprising the pargan\u00e1s of Kampil and Shams\u00e1b\u00e1d west. The tahsil is divided into an upland (b\u00e1ngar) and a lowland (tar\u00e1i) tract. The first and largest division consists of a plateau occupying the whole area west and south of the old Ganges cliff, and watered by the Bag\u00e1r river. On either bank of the stream stretches a wide expanse of sandy land (bh\u00far), showing in pargan\u00e1 Kampil some of the worst soil of its class in the District. North of this tract is a belt of fine yellowish loam, tilled by Kurmis, and famous for its sugar-cane cultivation, and its numerous and durable unbricked wells. South of the sandy tract extends a poorer loam, interspersed with saline plains, containing much uncultivable soil, dh\u00e1k jungle, and many lagoons and flooded spaces of rice land (jhabar). The lowlands, which skirt the present course of the Ganges, occupy nearly half of the whole tahsil, and consist of a flat alluvial tract, long since deserted by the Ganges, and liable to inundations from channels of the river. The belt of land skirting the river itself, some miles in breadth, is subject to almost yearly floods, and bears as a rule only a spring crop. An autumn crop is indeed sown, on the chance of the year being a dry one; but the floods usually sweep from the fields all hope of an autumn harvest. This tract is succeeded by a sandy and comparatively sterile belt, beyond which, below the cliff marking the old bank of the Ganges, runs a belt of fine loam about half a mile in breadth. The principal crops are wheat, barley, gram, jo\u00e1r, b\u00e1jra, sugar-cane, and cotton. Area of the tahsil, 371 square miles, of which about 240 square miles are returned as under cultivation. The population of the tahsil, in common with that of the District as a whole (see Farukhabad District), has decreased of late years from 182,873 in 1872, to 167,156 in 1881. In the latter year, the males numbered 88,779, and the females 78,377. Hindus numbered 144,011; Muhammadans, 22,998; Jains, 136; and \u2018others,\u2019 11. Land revenue, \u00a321,964; total Government revenue, \u00a325,464; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a339,962. The tahsil contains 1 civil and 1 criminal court, with 4 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 42 men; besides 444 village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs).\n\nK\u00e1imganj.\u2014Town in Kampil pargan\u00e1, Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of K\u00e1imganj tahsil. Situated in lat. 27\u00b0 33' 10\" N., and long. 79\u00b0 23' 45\" E., on the high cliff which marks the former bed of the Ganges, about a mile south of the Burhg\u00e1ng\u00e1 river. It is the terminus of a metalled road from Fatehgarh, the head-quarters of the District, 22 miles to the south-east. K\u00e1imganj is a long and narrow town, consisting chiefly of one wide metalled b\u00e1z\u00e1r, measuring about a mile from east to west, from which branch many narrow unmetalled lanes. It was founded in 1713 by Muhammad, the first Naw\u00e1b of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, who named it after his son K\u00e1im. It\nhas always been a stronghold of Path\u00e1ns. Many Path\u00e1ns hold small plots of land around the town, while other Path\u00e1n townsmen have taken military service under the British Government, or in Native States. During the Mutiny in 1858, the tahsili was ineffectually besieged for a short time by a band of fugitive insurgents from Kalpi. The population of the town, which was 8650 in 1865, had risen to 10,323 in 1872, and to 10,443 in 1881. In the latter year, Hindus numbered 6763; Muhammadans, 3546; Jains, 124; and Christians, 10. Area of town site, 578 acres. For police and conservancy purposes, a house-tax realized \u00a3223 in 1878\u201379. Fields yielding three crops annually extend up to the very walls of the houses, and Kaimganj is noted for its mangoes, tobacco, and potatoes. It is also a prosperous commercial town, and has superseded Shams\u00e1b\u00e1d as the chief place of trade on the road from Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d to Bud\u00e1un. Several kinds of cloth are manufactured, one for turbans, another for the fine apparel of women, and a third for stronger and coarser garments. The profession and habits of its Path\u00e1n population fostered in former times a manufacture of swords and matchlocks, which has now dwindled down to a trade in ordinary knives and betel-nut cutters. Besides the ordinary tahsili courts and offices, the town contains a first-class police station, imperial post-office, English school, dispensary, sar\u00e1\u00ed (native inn), and public garden.\n\nK\u00e1imur. \u2014 The eastern but detached portions of the Vindhyan range, commencing near Kat\u00e1ngi in Jabalpur (Jubbulpore) District of the Central Provinces, and running through the State of Rew\u00e1 and Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District of Bengal, dividing the valley of the Tons from that of the Son (Soane). In the Central Provinces, this range almost disappears in places, and never attains many hundred feet above the plain; but in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District it rises precipitously to a height of about 1500 feet above sea-level, the summit forming a long table-land, with a series of saucer-shaped valleys, each a few miles in diameter, containing a deposit of rich vegetable mould in the centre, and producing the finest crops. The formation is primitive sandstone, intermixed with schistose limestone. The ruined fortress of Roht\u00e1s is situated on these hills. Several gh\u00e1ts or passes lead to the summit, some of which are practicable for beasts of burden. The K\u00e1imur range commences in lat. 24\u00b0 31' 30\" N., and long. 83\u00b0 24' E., within the Central Provinces, and occupies more or less continuously the great hilly area which extends from that point to lat. 25\u00b0 N., and long. 84\u00b0 3' 30\" E., within the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal.\n\nKaira (Kheda). \u2014 District in the Northern Division of Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), Bombay Presidency. Lies between 22\u00b0 26' and 23\u00b0 6' N. lat., and between 72\u00b0 33' and 73\u00b0 21' E. long. Bounded on the north by\nAhmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Mahi K\u00e1ntha, and the small State of B\u00e1las\u00ednor in the District of Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha; on the west by Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District and the Native State of Cambay; on the south and east by the river Mahi and the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r's territory (Baroda). The breadth of the District varies from 25 to 40 miles. Area, 1609 square miles; population (1881) 804,800 persons.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Excepting a small corner of hilly ground near its northern boundary, and in the south-east and south, where the land along the Mahi is furrowed into deep ravines, the District of Kaira forms one unbroken plain sloping gently towards the south-west. The north and north-east portions are dotted with patches of rich rice land, broken by untilled tracts of low brushwood. The centre of the District, called the charotar or goodly land, is very fertile and highly cultivated; the luxuriant fields are surrounded by high-growing hedges, and the whole country is clothed with clusters of large shapely trees. Westwards, this belt of rich vegetation passes into a bare though well-cultivated tract of rice land, growing more barren and open to the south till it reaches the maritime belt, whitened by a salt-like crust, on the Gulf of Cambay.\n\nRivers.\u2014The Mahi, the largest river of Kaira, and the third in importance of the Gujar\u00e1t rivers, flows for nearly a hundred miles along the east, south-east, and south boundary of the District. Its deeply cut bed, sandbanks, and scanty summer channel, unfit it for either irrigation or navigation. This river is specially sacred to the Kol\u00eds, who believe that no guilty person can succeed in swallowing its waters. Its banks were formerly inhabited by predatory tribes, and there is a Kol\u00ed saying that 'when the Mahi is crossed, there is safety.' One hundred miles of the course of the Mahi lie within or border on Kaira District. This hundred miles may be divided into three sections, first a stretch of forty miles over a rough and rocky bed, then ten miles of a still stream with a sandy bed, and forty-five miles of a tidal river. The fords in the District are at K\u00e1vi, Dehv\u00e1n, Gajna, Kh\u00e1npur, and Ometa. At Ver\u00e1kh\u00e1ndi, the limit of the flow of the tidal wave, the bed is in the dry season 500 yards wide, the stream 120 yards, and the average depth 1\u00bd feet. A small 'bore' rises in the estuary at springs and dashes itself on the Dehv\u00e1n. The S\u00e1barmati, the fourth largest river in Gujar\u00e1t, flows for 14 miles along the western boundary, and is much used for irrigation. The Shedhi, being charged with soda, is not adapted for irrigation. The Kh\u00e1ri, one of five smaller streams, waters a large area by means of canals and sluices, but fails at the end of the rice season, that is to say, about November. Except in two small tracts in the north-east and southwest of the District, where the land is saturated with salt, the supply from wells, reservoirs, and rivers is plentiful. Number of wells in\n1876, 9341; water-lifts, 531; ponds, 4600; besides 9 canals and dams.\n\nMinerals.\u2014Iron-ore was at one time worked in the neighbourhood of Kapadwanj. In the bed of the M\u00e1jam river, about 15 miles from Kapadwanj, are found varieties of agate and moss stone. The bed of the Mahi contains masses and boulders of trap; while on its upper portion, on the B\u00e1lsinor frontier, rock is plentiful, including trap, with occasional limestone, quartz, and granite. At Lasundra, about 24 miles from the Nari\u00e1d railway station, and about 12 miles from the Dakor railway station, springs of hot water rise to the surface in ten or twelve cisterns, the hottest having a temperature of 115\u00b0 F. The water, slightly sulphurous, is thought to be useful for the cure of skin diseases. The place is held sacred by the Hindus, and is called R\u00e1m Kshetra, as R\u00e1mchandra, the hero of the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, performed here the shr\u00e1dh ceremonies for the soul of his father.\n\nWild Animals.\u2014Tigers and leopards, a few years ago always to be found in the bed of the Mahi, are now rarely heard of, owing to the spread of tillage and their pursuit by European sportsmen. Hy\u00e6nas, jackals, foxes, wild hog, antelope, gazelle, and hares are common. Of game birds, besides many varieties of duck, snipe and quail abound; while geese, bustard, partridge, quail, and florican may occasionally be shot. Poisonous snakes are common. A reward of from 1s. 6d. to 6d. is paid for killing a cobra, and from 1s. to 3d. for killing other kinds. In 1877, 19 persons died from snake-bite. M\u00e1lhs\u00edr and other freshwater fish are caught in the waters of the most considerable rivers.\n\nHistory.\u2014Kaira District is made up partly of lands acquired from the Peshw\u00e1 in 1802, by the treaty of Bassein, partly of territory transferred by the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda in 1803 and 1817. R\u00e1jputs reigned in Kaira from 746 to 1290. The most celebrated dynasty was the Anhilw\u00e1r\u00e1. At the end of the 14th century Kaira passed to the Muhammadan kings of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, and in 1573 was transferred to the Mughals. In 1720, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s appeared; and from that time to the fall of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d in 1753, the District was the scene of perpetual struggles between the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and the Muhammadan viceroys. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were victorious, and in 1753 the District was shared between the Peshw\u00e1 and his lieutenant the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r.\n\nPart of the lands of the District came into British possession in 1803, and the rest in 1817. Under the terms of the treaty of Bassein (31st December 1802), the N\u00e1p\u00e1d group of villages was handed over by the Peshw\u00e1. In 1803, for the maintenance of troops supplied by the British Government, the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r ceded Nadi\u00e1d, M\u00e1tar, and Mahudha, as well as the fort and town of Kaira. Again, by treaty dated 6th November 1817, to provide for the payment of additional troops, the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r ceded Mehmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, Al\u00edna, Th\u00e1sra, Antroli, and\nhalf of the town and district of Petl\u0101d. At the same time, Kapadwanj and Bh\u00e1laj were received in exchange for the district of Bij\u00e1pur in North Gujar\u00e1t.\n\nThe territories acquired in 1803, together with Dholka, Dhandhuka, Ranpur, and Gogha, which now form part of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District, remained in charge of the Resident at Baroda from the date of their cession till May 1805. During this time a European assistant and native officers administered, according to local usage, the police and justice of the country. In 1805, a Collector was appointed, with jurisdiction over the ceded tracts, both those to the north of the Mahi and those to the west of the Gulf of Cambay. In the same year the town of KAIRA (q.v.) was selected as a large military station.\n\nThe increase in the British possessions consequent on the treaty of November 1817 necessitated fresh administrative arrangements. The territory north of the Mahi was, from the 1st January 1818, divided into the two Districts of Kaira and Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. In 1830, Kapadwanj was included in Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Kaira reduced to a Sub-Collectorate under the principal Collector of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. In 1833, Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d and Kaira were again separated. Since then, more than once, villages have been moved from one District to the other, and the original irregular groups and collections of villages have been gradually consolidated into seven Sub-divisions.\n\nPopulation.\u2014In 1846, the population of the District was returned at 566,513, or 354 to the square mile. By 1872 it had risen to 782,733 persons, residing in 591 villages and 218,596 houses; density per square mile, 489. This latter density indicated a pressure of population higher at the time than in any other part of the Bombay Presidency.\n\nBy the Census of February 17, 1881, the population of the District was returned at 804,800; area, 1609 square miles; density of population, 500 to the square mile. The increase of population since 1872 has been nearly three per cent., and the District is still the most densely peopled part of the Presidency, outside the city of Bombay. The number of towns in the District was in 1881 returned at 10; villages, 571; occupied houses, 191,282; unoccupied houses, 51,396. Males numbered 426,781; females, 378,019; proportion of males, 53 per cent. In 1881, there was a town or village to each 2.77 square miles; houses to the square mile, 150; persons per occupied house, 4.2.\n\nOf the 581 towns and villages in the District in 1881, 38 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 124 from two to five hundred; 158 from five hundred to one thousand; 155 from one to two thousand; 61 from two to three thousand; 30 from three to five thousand; 10 from five to ten thousand; 4 from ten to fifteen thousand; and 1 from twenty thousand to fifty thousand.\nClassified according to occupation, the males were divided into six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every description and the learned professions, 8431; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 2578; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 5547; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 190,826; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 43,115; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 176,284.\n\nClassified according to religion, there were, in 1881, 383,207 male and 337,659 female Hindus; total, 720,866, or 89.6 per cent. of the total population. Muhammadans numbered 72,954, or 9.1 per cent.; Christians, 1041; Jains, 9603; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 131; Jews, 7; aboriginal tribes and \u2018others,\u2019 198. Under the term Hindu are included the following caste sub-divisions:\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 41,499; R\u00e1jputs, 25,973; Cham\u00e1rs, 10,874; Darj\u00eds, 2256; Dhob\u00eds (washermen), 1035; Hajj\u00e1ms (barbers), 10,859; Kunb\u00eds (agriculturists), 143,151; Kol\u00eds (agriculturists), 279,344; Kumbhars, 8982; Loh\u00e1ns, 3196; Loh\u00e1rs (blacksmiths), 5964; M\u00e1l\u00eds (gardeners), 1106; Mahars or Dhers, 42,800; Son\u00e1rs (goldsmiths), 2710; Sutars, 7807; Tel\u00eds (oilmen), 83; Banj\u00e1r\u00eds, 113; and \u2018other Hindus,\u2019 133,114. The aboriginal tribes are mostly (187) Bh\u00edls. The Muhammadans include Path\u00e1ns, 8703; Sayyids, 2953; Shaikhs, 6482; and Sindh\u00eds, 270.\n\nAmong Hindus, the most important classes are the Lewa and Kadwa Kunb\u00eds, numbering 142,774; they are the best farmers in the District, and a sober, peaceable, and industrious race. The Kunb\u00eds of certain villages are held in honour, as descended from the leading men among the original settlers in Gujar\u00e1t. The R\u00e1jputs, with the exception of a few who with the title of Th\u00e1kur still retain landed estates, have sunk into the mass of ordinary peasant proprietors. The Kol\u00eds number 279,340, or 34.7 per cent. of the entire population. Idle and turbulent under native rule, they are now quiet, hard-working, and prosperous. Among Hindu low castes, the Dhers or Mahars (42,800) are distinguished for industry and good behaviour. They formerly lived in comfort by weaving coarse cotton cloth, but the competition of the Bombay and local steam mills is now shutting them out of the market.\n\nThe Bh\u00e1ts or B\u00e1rots, R\u00e1jput bards and genealogists, have their head-quarters in Kaira District. Many of the caste, formerly of much sanctity and importance, have had to turn themselves to ordinary pastoral occupations; but some remain who travel to distant parts of India. Their different places of call are visited in order, generally at two or three years\u2019 interval. At each station they claim hospitality from castes which claim a R\u00e1jput descent. They are entertained in\nsome patron's house, remaining in one place several months, and during their stay they note down the births, marriages, and deaths that have happened in the family since the last visit. These particulars are carried away and duly recorded on the return to Kaira.\n\nOf the Musalm\u00e1n population, about one-third, under the name of Sayyids, Shaikhs, Path\u00e1ns, and Mughals, represent the foreign conquerors of Gujar\u00e1t. The remainder, called Momn\u00e1s, Borahs, Ta\u00eds, and Gh\u00e1nch\u00eds, are the descendants of Hindus converted to Isl\u00e1m under the Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d kings. Musalm\u00e1ns of the first class, employed chiefly as cultivators, or in Government service as police and messengers, are for the most part poor. Musalm\u00e1ns of the second class, artisans, chiefly weavers and oil-pressers, are hard-working and well-to-do.\n\nThe aggregate urban population of the District is 121,801, or 15 per cent. of the total population.\n\nAgriculture, the most important industry of the District, supports 5,46,978 persons, or 68 per cent. of the total population. The soils belong to four classes\u2014light, medium, black, and alluvial, with subordinate varieties. The alluvial or b\u00e1tha land is chiefly found near the V\u00e1trak river, and is a rich garden soil. In 1880\u201381, 371,793 acres, or 76\u00b799 per cent. of the Government cultivable land, were taken up for tillage, and 19,421 acres were fallow or under grass. Grain crops occupied 304,253 acres, or 81\u00b783 per cent.; pulses, 31,199 acres, or 8\u00b739 per cent.; oil-seeds, 5348 acres, or 1\u00b743 per cent.; fibres, 4662 acres, or 1\u00b724 per cent., of which 4424 acres were under cotton; miscellaneous crops, 17,640 acres, or 4\u00b774 per cent., of which 11,754 acres were under tobacco. Spiked millet, b\u00e1jra (Pennisetum typhoideum), the staple grain crop, occupied 104,920 acres in 1881\u201382, or 27\u00b74 per cent. of the total area (382,425 acres) under cultivation in that year. In 1881\u201382, sugar-cane covered 1209 acres; indigo, 185 acres; and other dye-stuffs, 2626 acres. In the same year the agricultural stock of the District consisted of\u2014bullocks, 136,235; cows, 49,345; buffaloes, 175,946; horses, 1948; asses, 5894; sheep and goats, 42,700; ploughs, 60,513; carts, 26,669.\n\nThe prices of agricultural produce in 1881\u201382 per maund of 80 lbs. ranged as follows:\u2014Wheat, 5s. 3d.; barley, 2s. 9\u00bdd.; rice (best), 8s. 8d.; rice (common), 5s. 5d.; b\u00e1jra, 4s. 6d.; jo\u00e1r, 3s. 8d.; gram, 2s.; salt, 6s. 2d.; flour, 6s. 6d.; d\u00e1l, 4s. 5d.; firewood, 1s.; gh\u00ed, \u00a33.\n\nThe average wages earned in Kaira District are from 9d. to 1s. per diem for skilled, and 3d. to 4\u00bdd. per diem for unskilled labour. Carts may be hired at 2s. per diem; asses at from 3d. to 4\u00bdd.\n\nThe finest tobacco in Western India is grown in Kaira; but though skilful in rearing the plant, the cultivators know nothing of its preparation for the European market. Two varieties of tobacco are grown, the talabdi, or local plant, and the Kh\u00e1ndeshi, or plant\nintroduced from Kh\u00e1ndesh. An irrigated field yields twice as large a tobacco crop as a dry one. About the beginning of July, as soon as the first rain has fallen, the seed is sown on a well-prepared plot of ground, and after about a month and a half the seedlings are ready for transplantation. The field is scored in squares by a heavy, long-toothed rake, and at each point of intersection a seedling is set. The plant takes about five and a half months to ripen. As soon as it is ready, it is carefully examined, and divided into two classes, k\u00e1l\u00edo and jardo; the k\u00e1l\u00edo is cut down, stalk and all, and laid out to dry; the jardo is left a little longer, and then the leaves are stripped off the stem. The k\u00e1l\u00edo is used for hookahs and for snuff; the jardo for chewing and smoking in cigarettes and pipes. The caterpillar is the chief enemy of the plant. Tobacco-growing is a costly process, and can only be undertaken by substantial cultivators. In 1876, it was calculated that the cost of rearing an acre of plant was \u00a327, and the profit \u00a310, 15s.\n\nCotton is grown only from the local plant, and occupies every seventh furrow in fields sown with ordinary grain crops. Several attempts have been made to improve the Kaira cotton, but without success. Indigo was once one of the chief exports from Gujar\u00e1t, but in 1827 it had almost ceased to be produced. An attempt to encourage the growth in Kaira later on was attended with failure. A Government silk garden was started in 1837, but was closed in 1847. Not only the strictly agricultural classes, Kunb\u00eds, Kol\u00eds, and Musalm\u00e1ns, but the whole population, including Br\u00e1hmans and men of all castes, engage in agriculture.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014A severe famine took place in 1791-92\u2014rain fell only once that year; in 1813-14, there were only two showers of rain throughout the year; in 1825, the later rains failed, and remissions of land revenue to the amount of \u00a316,198 were granted. On the other hand, the period 1814-22 was marked by heavy floods and rainfall that caused much damage to the country. In 1834, locusts ate up the crops, and remissions amounting to \u00a319,655 were sanctioned. In 1837, 1868, and 1871, disastrous storms swept over the District. During the forty years 1836-1876, though the rainfall has at times been scanty and the crops have failed, no season of famine or even of general scarcity has occurred in Kaira District. Owing to the scanty rainfall in 1877 (19\u00b713 inches), there was a partial failure of crops, and the poorer people, especially in the Kapadwanj and Th\u00e1sra Sub-divisions in the north-east, suffered some distress, which, however, did not leave behind serious results.\n\n**Land Tenures.**\u2014In 1803, when Kaira was ceded to the British, the District afforded examples of various forms of administration. In the centre were three kinds of villages, r\u00e1sti, or peaceable, melw\u00e1s, or\nrefractory, and an intermediate class of r\u0101sti-mehw\u0101s villages. The refractory villages were occupied by the turbulent descendants of the R\u00e1jput and Kol\u00ed warriors. Here Koli th\u00e1kurs or chiefs administered despotically their little clusters of beehive-looking huts. Revenue was stipulated for, but seldom paid. The peaceable villages were mostly grants of Government to those who had done some public service. The most important Muhammadan grants were called m\u00e1liks, and were held rent-free. Internal administration was the concern of the village community. There were four forms of village government, the commonest being that by which the village head-man engaged annually for the payment of a certain sum to Government. The profits of a good year, under this, the most simple and general system employed under the Peshw\u00e1, went to the head-man: on the other hand, the head-man had to bear any loss from failure of crop or short tillage. Above the head-man or p\u00e1tel were the revenue-farmers (kam\u00e1visdd\u00e1r), who fixed the village contributions, and below the head-men were the cultivators and coparceners of the village. A class quite apart, called manotid\u00e1rs, or money-lenders, arose as sureties for the payment of the revenue. This short statement furnishes an outline of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 revenue system. It has the merit of simplicity, and was calculated to ensure the recovery of revenue. At the same time it is clear that it was extremely liable to abuses and suffering to the cultivating masses.\n\nWhen the District was taken over by the British in 1803, the system was continued with but small modification until 1862. In that year the revenue survey system, which deals directly with individual cultivators, was introduced. The financial result of the survey assessment was an increase over the whole District of 11 per cent. in the Government land revenue demand. Of the 559 Government villages, 90 are held on the narv\u00e1d\u00e1ri tenure. The peculiarity of this holding is, that it involves joint responsibility for the payment of the Government revenue. In narv\u00e1d\u00e1ri villages, the pattid\u00e1rs or sharers belong to the Kunb\u00ed caste, and on account of being narv\u00e1d\u00e1rs hold a high position among their fellows, being the descendants of the old proprietary cultivators. This tenure has been carefully preserved by Act v. of 1862 of the Bombay Government, but the land-tax is levied at survey rates on the whole arable land. Of late there have been instances of the community applying to change their special tenure for that under the Survey Act. The villages on the banks of the river Mahi, held on the mehw\u00e1si tenure, pay their revenue in a lump sum. A clan of Musalm\u00e1n yeomen, known as the M\u00e1liks, have for nearly 400 years held 27 villages on a special tenure.\n\nTrade.\u2014Exports\u2014grain, tobacco, butter, oil, and the petals of the mahu\u00e1 flower; imports\u2014piece-goods, grocery, molasses, and dye-stuffs.\nKaira is particularly noted for its gh\u00ed or clarified butter, the export of which is calculated to benefit the District to the extent of \u00a380,000 annually. The gh\u00ed when made is forced into large leather bottles holding from 60 to 200 lbs. The opening of steam factories at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d and of the Kaira railway centre of Nadi\u00e1d has greatly reduced the demand for handspun cotton, once a staple. The produce of the Bombay and Gujar\u00e1t weaving mills now threatens to destroy the demand both for native handiwork and for European piece-goods. The water of the District is thought to be especially good for dyeing purposes; its calico prints are sought after in regions so distant as Siam. Soap and glass are manufactured at Kapadwanj, and a steam spinning and weaving mill has recently been established at Nadi\u00e1d, with 12,704 spindles. Considerable quantities of coarse cloth for home consumption are woven in handlooms by the lower castes of Hindus. In the larger towns, calico printing is carried on by a class known as Bh\u00e1vs\u00e1rs or Chhipi\u00e1s. There were no made roads of any kind, except one mile, in the District in 1844. About 72 miles of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway now run through the middle of the District; and 195 miles of road have during the past thirteen years been constructed or re-made. A new road is being made from the rice-producing villages on the Kh\u00e1ri canals, to Bar\u00e1jri station on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway. There are 10 rest-houses for travellers in the District, built since 1869 at a cost to local funds of \u00a36191. Two ferries ply across the Mahi. There are 13 post-offices in the District. Letter-boxes are placed in most villages. Money-lending is chiefly in the hands of the Baniy\u00e1, S\u00e1r\u00e1wak, and Sonar, or jeweller, castes. Rates of interest vary, according to the credit of the borrower, from 6 to 18 per cent. per annum, rising in the case of poor cultivators and labourers to 25 per cent. In Kaira there are no guilds for trade purposes such as are found in Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, and the system of apprenticeship is not known.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total revenue of Kaira, imperial, local, and municipal, amounted in 1882-83 to \u00a3231,945, or, on a population of 804,800, an incidence per head of 5s. 7\u00bdd. The land-tax forms the great source of revenue, amounting (1882-83) to \u00a3197,316; other large items are stamps and local funds (\u00a333,277). The District is distributed for administrative purposes into 7 Sub-divisions (namely, Kapadwanj, Th\u00e1sra, Mehm\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d, Nadi\u00e1d, M\u00e1tar, Anand, and Borsad); and contains five municipal towns, with an aggregate population of 71,330\u2014viz. Nadi\u00e1d, population (1881) 28,304; Kapadwanj, 14,442; Kaira, 12,640; Mehm\u00e1d\u00e1b\u00e1d, 8173; Dakor, 7771. The total municipal receipts amounted in 1882-83 to \u00a35341, and the incidence of municipal taxation varied from 5\u00bdd. to 2s. 9d. per head. Other towns of importance are Umreth (14,643), Borsad (12,228), Mahuda (9440),\nM\u0101tar (4889), and Anand (9271). The revenue administration of the District is conducted by a Collector and three Assistants, of whom one is a covenanted civilian; for judicial purposes, Kaira is included in the jurisdiction of the Judge of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. There are 5 civil courts, the yearly number of suits decided being about 11,000; 19 officers administer criminal justice. The regular police (1882\u201383) consists of 722 officers and men, being 1 man to every 2\u00b72 square miles and to each 1116 inhabitants, costing \u00a312,171, equal to \u00a37, 11s. 3\u00bdd. per square mile and 3\u00bed. per head of the population; average annual pay per man, \u00a310. Number of persons convicted of any offence, great or small, 2108, being 1 to every 381 of the population. In 1880, the daily average prison population was 166, including 9 females; the total cost of the jail was \u00a3964, or \u00a35, 16s. 3\u00bdd. per prisoner; cash profit on manufactures, \u00a385, 14s., or 10s. per effective prisoner; death-rate, 14 per thousand. There was 1 prisoner in jail to every 4850 of the District population.\n\nEducation has widely spread of late years. In 1855\u201356, there were only 7 schools, attended by 1036 pupils; by 1876\u201377, the number of schools had risen to 189, and of pupils to 14,720, or an average of 1 school to every 3 villages. In 1882\u201383, the number of schools was 220, with 18,372 pupils, or 2\u00b728 per cent. of the total population. Kaira District has a public library and twelve reading-rooms; and publishes two vernacular newspapers.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The average rainfall during the five years ending 1876 was 30 inches. To Europeans the climate is trying. From November to March the air is pleasant and bracing. By the people of the District, the charotar or central portion is considered healthy. Cholera is rare. The temperature varies between 54\u00b0 F. in January and 104\u00b0 in May. Fever of a malarious type is the prevailing disease. In 1881\u201382, seven dispensaries afforded medical relief to 998 in-door and 74,023 out-door patients, and 19,500 persons were vaccinated. Number of births (1882\u201383), 26,441; deaths, 22\u00b73 per thousand.

Municipal revenue (1882-83), \u00a3898; incidence of municipal taxation, 1s. 3\u00bdd. per head.\n\nKaira is a very ancient city, having a legendary connection with the Mahabharata, and is proved by the evidence of copper-plate grants to have been known as early as the 5th century A.D. Early in the 18th century it passed to the Babi family, with whom it remained till 1763, when it was taken by the Marathas under Dami Gaekwar; it was finally handed over to the British by Anand Rao Gaekwar in 1803. Its frontier position rendered Kaira important to us; and a large body of infantry, cavalry, and artillery were stationed there, until the transfer, in 1830, of the frontier station to Deesa (Disa). The Collector, superintendent of police, executive engineer, and civil surgeon constitute the administrative staff at Kaira. The climate of the town is said to have improved of late years. Earthquake shocks were felt in 1860 and 1864. The court-house is a handsome building with Greek pillars. Near it is the old jail, in 1814 the scene of a riot in which the prisoners rose, and which was only suppressed with a loss of 19 killed and 12 wounded. Reading-room, library, and clock-tower; four Government schools, with an average attendance of 333 pupils; civil hospital and post-office.\n\nKairana.\u2014Town and municipality in Shamli tahsil, Muzaffarnagar District, North-Western Provinces.

Situated partly on the Jumna (Jamuna) lowland, and partly on the bank which leads to the higher ground above; distant from Muzaffarnagar town 31 miles south-west. Mukarrab Khan, physician to the imperial family, received the town and surrounding country from Shah Jah\u00e1n; he adorned it with many edifices, and laid out a beautiful garden with a large tank. A flourishing town with a steadily increasing population, which has risen from 11,470 in 1847, to 15,162 in 1853, to 16,953 in 1865, to 17,742 in 1872, and to 18,374 in 1881.

Population (1876) 1815. Not returned separately in\nthe Census Report for 1881. The town is said to have been founded during the rule of Mir Fateh Ali Talpur.\n\n**Kaithal.**\u2014Western tahsil of Karn\u00e1l District, Punjab; lying between 29\u00b0 39' 30\" and 29\u00b0 57' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 13' and 76\u00b0 47' E. long. Area, 1106 square miles. Population (1881) 204,734, namely, males 110,990, and females 93,744; average density, 185 persons per square mile.

Lat. 29\u00b0 48' 7\" N., long. 76\u00b0 26' 26\" E. Kaithal is picturesquely situated on the brink of an extensive artificial lake or moat, which partly surrounds it, with numerous bathing-places and flights of steps. It is said to have been founded by the mythical hero Yudhisthira, and connected by tradition with the monkey-god Han\u00fam\u00e1n. It bears in Sanskrit the name of Kapisthala, or the abode of monkeys\u2014a name which still applies. The town was renovated, and a fort built, under Akbar. In 1767 it fell into the hands of the Sikh chieftain Bh\u00e1i Desu Singh, whose descendants, the Bh\u00e1\u00eds of Kaithal, ranked amongst the most important and powerful cis-Sutlej chiefs. Their territories lapsed to the British Government in 1843. For a few years Kaithal formed the head-quarters of a separate District, but in 1849 it was absorbed into the District of Thanesar, and again transferred in 1862 to that of Karn\u00e1l. The now somewhat dilapidated fort or palace of the Bh\u00e1\u00eds stands out prominently on the bank of the lake. A high mud wall encloses the opposite side of the town. Population (1868) 14,940; (1881) 14,754, namely, males 7302, and females 7452.

Hindus numbered 3286; Muhammadans, 1670; and \u2018others,\u2019 75.\n\nK\u00e1iti.\u2014Village in the Nilgiri Hills District, Madras Presidency; situated in lat. 11\u00b0 22' 30\" N., and long. 76\u00b0 46' 30\" E., in a valley of the same name, 3 miles from Ut\u00e1kamand (Ootacamund). Population (1881) 2954; number of houses, 575. Notable as one of the earliest settlements on the Nilgiris. A Government experimental farm was established in 1831, and the first tea plants sent from Calcutta to the Nilgiris were planted here four years later. The valley is closely cultivated with barley, wheat, and other cereals, potatoes and garden crops. In 1833, Lord Elphinstone, then Governor, obtained the land on lease, and built and furnished a beautiful house, which in 1841 became the property of a civilian, from whom it passed to the Basel Mission. There are about 40 Christians in the valley. Three miles distant is the missionary out-station of Nikambe.\n\nKaj\u00fari, or Kajuri All\u00e1d\u00e1d.\u2014Estate held by a guaranteed Gir\u00e1s\u00eda, Th\u00e1kur, or chief, under the Bhop\u00e1l Agency, Central India. It is one of the sub-divisions of territory assigned to R\u00e1jan Kh\u00e1n, brother of the notorious Pind\u00e1ri leader, Ch\u00edt\u00fa. At the death of R\u00e1jan Kh\u00e1n, the share of Kaj\u00fari fell to one of his sons, Il\u00e1hi Bakhsh, who was succeeded in 1859 by his posthumous son, Kar\u00edm Bakshsh, the present chief.

Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Government, the zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1ri, of which Kak\u00e1ir is the chief place, was held on condition of furnishing 500 soldiers when required. In 1809, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was dispossessed of his territory; but, having joined the rebels in the troubles which arose on the escape of Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, he retook Kak\u00e1ir, and was confirmed in possession, subject only to the payment of a fixed rent of \u00a350 annually.\n\nK\u00e1kar.\u2014T\u00e1luk of Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency; lying between 26\u00b0 51' 15\" and 27\u00b0 13' 45\" N. lat., and between 67\u00b0 24' and 68\u00b0 2' E. long.

Government vernacular school.\n\nKakarb\u00e1i.\u2014Village in Jh\u00e1nsi District, North-Western Provinces; situated on a peak to the left of the Chaich n\u00e1di, 54 miles from Jh\u00e1nsi town, and 9 miles from Garotha. Population (1881) 1,633. Post-office and police station.\n\nKakora.\u2014Village in Bud\u00e1un tahsil, Bud\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces; situated near the bank of the Ganges, 12 miles from Bud\u00e1un town. The village contains only about 2,000 inhabitants, but is noted for its large annual religious trading fair held at the full moon of the month of K\u00e1rt\u00edk (October-November), which is attended by as many as 100,000 persons, from Cawnpur, Delhi, Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, and various parts of Rohilkhand. After performing their religious ablutions in the sacred river, the pilgrims turn their attention to trade. The principal articles bought and sold are household furniture, confectionery and fruit, cooking utensils, shoes, cloth and other fabrics, to each of which a separate b\u00e1z\u00e1r is assigned. Articles of European manufacture are sold at a few stalls.\n\nK\u00e1kori.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Lucknow District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Malih\u00e1b\u00e1d pargan\u00e1; on the east by Lucknow pargan\u00e1; on the south by Bijnaur pargan\u00e1; and on the west by Moh\u00e1n Aur\u00e1s pargan\u00e1 of Unao District. Originally in the possession of the Bhars, who were expelled by the B\u00e1is R\u00e1jputs, and the tract included in the B\u00e1isw\u00e1ra kingdom. The B\u00e1is R\u00e1j\u00e1 S\u00e1than fixed upon the old Bhar stronghold of K\u00e1korgarh as his fort and head-quarters, from which he despatched plundering expeditions into the surrounding country. A force was sent against him by the Muhammadan King of Jaunpur; the R\u00e1j\u00e1 was defeated and slain, and the R\u00e1jputs expelled from the pargan\u00e1. At the present day, 34 out of the 64 villages are held by the descendants of the victorious Musalm\u00e1ns. Area, 60 square miles, of which 30 are cultivated; the remaining half is nearly all uncultivable, owing to the extent of saline (\u00ed\u015bar) plains. Average incidence of Government land\nrevenue, 4s. 10\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d. per acre of cultivated area; 3s. 6d. per acre of assessed area; and 2s. 3\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d. per acre of total area. Population (1869) 31,789; (1881) 30,535, namely, males 15,523, and females 15,012. The main line of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway runs through this pargan\u00e1, within a mile of K\u00e1kori town.\n\n**K\u00e1kori.**\u2014Town in K\u00e1kori pargan\u00e1, Lucknow District, Oudh; situated nine miles due west of Lucknow city. Lat. 26\u00b0 51' 55\" N., long. 80\u00b0 49' 45\" E. An ancient town, dating from the time of the Bhars. Next to Lucknow city, it is the largest town of the District, and its well-stocked b\u00e1z\u00e1srs indicate considerable prosperity. The weaving trade, however, for which it was formerly noted, has of late years decayed. K\u00e1kori contains the tombs of several Muhammadan saints, and is the birthplace of numerous distinguished Musalm\u00e1ns who have served under both the Native and British Governments during the past century. Many of the native lawyers (wakils) practising in the Lucknow courts reside in the town, and their well-built red brick residences considerably add to the beauty of the place. The population which in 1872 was returned at 8467, had fallen in 1881 to 7462, namely, Hindus, 3909; and Muhammadans, 3553. Area of town site, 115 acres. For police and conservancy purposes, a small house-tax is levied. Two bi-weekly markets; Government school.\n\n**Kakr\u00e1la.**\u2014Town in D\u00e1t\u00e1ganj tahsil, Bud\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces; lying on the unmetalled road from Bud\u00e1un town to Usah\u00e1t, 12 miles distant from the former place. Population (1881) 5810, namely, 3469 Muhammadans, 2305 Hindus, and 36 Christians. Area of town site, 62 acres. A small municipal revenue is raised for police and conservancy purposes. The public buildings consist of a police station, post-office, s\u00e1rdi or native travellers\u2019 rest-house, and a village school. There are also a Hindu temple and several mosques. Trade and manufactures insignificant. The town was burnt during the Mutiny, and consists at present chiefly of mud-built huts. In April 1858, a British force under General Penny, when advancing against the rebels, was attacked by a party of Gh\u00e1z\u00eds or Muhammadan fanatics lying in ambush near Kakr\u00e1la. The general was killed in the fight, but the attacking party were completely defeated, and this victory put an end to the rebel government which had ruled at Bud\u00e1un during the previous eleven months.\n\n**Kakr\u00e1ul.**\u2014Village in Darbhangah District, Bengal; situated about 12 miles north of Darbhangah town, on the Jainagar road. Population (1872) 2440; (1881) 2945. Cloth of fine texture is woven here, and is very popular with the Nep\u00e1lese. An ancient sage, Kapil Muni, is said to have lived in the village. Annual fair in January or February.\n\n**K\u00e1ks\u00e1.**\u2014Village and head-quarters of a police circle (th\u00e1n\u00e1) in\nBardw\u00e1n District, Bengal. Lat. $23^\\circ 27' 10''$ N., long. $87^\\circ 30' 12''$ E. Station on the chord line of the East Indian Railway.\n\n**K\u00e1kw\u00e1giri.**\u2014Village in the G\u00e1ro Hills, Assam, which figured prominently in the operations during the G\u00e1ro Expedition of 1872\u201373. *(See Garo Hills.)* It was discovered, at an early stage of the expedition, that this village and B\u00e1w\u00edgiri were notoriously among the most disaffected, and they were occupied without difficulty, several prisoners being taken.\n\n**K\u00e1lab\u00e1gh.**\u2014Town, municipality, and salt mines in Bannu District, Punjab. Lat. $32^\\circ 57' 57''$ N., long. $71^\\circ 35' 37''$ E. Population (1881) 6056, namely, 4993 Muhammadans, 936 Hindus, 54 Sikhs, and 73 \u2018others.\u2019 Picturesquely situated at the foot of the Salt Range, on the right bank of the Indus, at the point where the river debouches from the hills, 105 miles below Attock. The houses nestle against the side of a precipitous hill of solid rock-salt, piled one upon another in successive tiers, the roof of each tier forming the street which passes in front of the row immediately above. Overhead, a cliff, also of pure rock-salt, towers above the town. An Aw\u00e1n family, who reside in K\u00e1lab\u00e1gh, have a certain supremacy over the whole of their fellow-tribesmen, the representative of the family being known as Sard\u00e1r or Kh\u00e1n. The salt is quarried at M\u00e1ri, opposite the town, where it stands out in huge cliffs, practically inexhaustible. The similar outcrop at K\u00e1lab\u00e1gh itself is not quarried. The quarries, six in number, are situated in the Lun n\u00e1l\u00ed, a small tributary of the Indus on its right bank. The d\u00e9p\u00f4t at which the salt is sold stands on the left bank of the n\u00e1l\u00ed, close to the Indus.\n\nThe salt occurs underlying tertiary strata in workable seams of from four to twenty feet thick, alternating with seams of impure salt and marl. It is quarried in the usual way by blasting, broken into pieces of suitable size, and then moved to the Government d\u00e9p\u00f4t on cattle. The miners supply the cattle, and are paid at the rate of 2s. per 35 maunds of salt quarried; and 2s. 6d. per 100 maunds in addition for the salt when delivered at the d\u00e9p\u00f4t. The whole of the operations connected with the salt up to the time that it is deposited in store in the d\u00e9p\u00f4t are in the hands of the miners. At the d\u00e9p\u00f4t, the salt is weighed out to purchasers, and cleared under the supervision of the inspector in charge, after which it finds its way either up the river to Makhad and thence to R\u00e1wal Pindi, or down the river to Sind and places en route. The quantity turned out in 1871\u201372 amounted to 77,615 maunds (say 2717 tons), and the revenue was \u00a323,284. The average annual out-turn of salt delivered to traders for the four years ending 1882\u201383 was 80,859 maunds, or 2888 tons. Alum also occurs in the neighbouring hills, and forms a considerable item of local trade, the out-turn being about 10,000 maunds per annum, selling on the spot\nfor 7s. per maund of 80 lbs. Manufacture of iron instruments from metal imported from the K\u00e1nigoram Hill. Staging bungalow, school-house, dispensary, sard\u00ed. Municipal revenue in 1881\u201382, \u00a3725, or 2s. 4\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits.\n\nKal\u00e1dgi, now officially called Bij\u00e1pur District.\u2014District in the Southern Division of the Bombay Presidency; situated between 15\u00b0 50' and 17\u00b0 27' N. lat., and 75\u00b0 31' and 76\u00b0 31' E. long. On the north Bij\u00e1pur is separated by the river Bh\u00edma from the District of Shol\u00e1pur and Akalkot State; on the east and south-east it is bounded by the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions (Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Deccan); on the south the M\u00e1lprabha river divides it from the District of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r and the State of R\u00e1mdr\u00fag; and on the west it is bounded by the States of Mudhol, J\u00e1mkh\u00e1ndi, and J\u00e1th. [The name of the District of Kal\u00e1dgi was finally changed to that of Bij\u00e1pur by Orders of the Bombay Government, dated 18th June 1884, with effect from 1st March 1885. By the same Orders the head-quarters of the District were to be transferred, as soon after that date as practicable, from Kal\u00e1dgi to Bij\u00e1pur (q.v.). The earlier volume of The Imperial Gazetteer containing Bij\u00e1pur was printed off before this change had been effected.] Area, 5757 square miles. Population (1881) 638,493 persons.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Though alike in many respects, the lands of the District may conveniently be divided into two main sections. The river Kisn\u00e1 (Krishna) divides the two tracts for some distance, but they meet and run into one another lower down in the Muddebihal Sub-division. Here also is found a third type of country, the Don valley, a well-defined tract. The forty miles north of Bij\u00e1pur town and the greater part of the Sindgi Sub-division form a succession of low billowy uplands, bare of trees, gently rounded, and falling into intermediate narrow valleys. On the uplands, the soil, where there is any, is very shallow; tillage is confined to the valleys; from every third or fourth upland issues a stream fringed with wild date trees. Among the trees are gardens, and beside the gardens stands the village; a little farther on a grove of trees shades the village temple. The barrenness of the country and the dreariness of upland after upland and valley after valley, each like the last, are depressing. During the rainy season when the uplands are green and the valleys waving with millet, the effect though tame is not unpleasing. In spite of its barrenness, the country has excellent water.\n\nThe Don valley begins close to the old city of Bij\u00e1pur, and crosses the District from west to east. This tract is of rich deep black soil; the rocky trap uplands disappear, the undulations are much longer and more gradual, and in many parts there is a true plain. The villages lie close to the Don river. This valley is badly off for water. In February, when the whole valley is a sheet of magnificent millet, wheat, and golden kusumbhi (Carthamus tinctorius), the prospect is extremely fine.\nSouth of the Kistna, towards the west, the level of the rich plain is broken by two lines of hills. These are for the most part rounded and sloping, but the steep and quaintly-shaped sandstone cliffs of B\u0101d\u0101mi form an exception to the rule. Between the hills lie wide barren tracts covered with loose stones; but there are also many stretches of light land, well wooded and bright with patches of red and white soil. To the east extends a black plain, as treeless and dull as that north of the Kistna.\n\nThe District is well supplied with rivers and water-courses. Of these, the most important are, beginning from the north, the Bh\u012bma, the Dhon, the Kistna, the Gh\u0101\u1e6dprabha, and the M\u0101lprabha, all large rivers flowing throughout the year, and, excepting the Dhon, impassable during the rainy season except by boats. There are also many small streams. The water of the Dhon is too salt to drink, but the other large streams supply drinking water of fairly good quality. In 1881\u201382, the District possessed for irrigation 467 dams, 456 water-lifts, and 6295 wells.\n\nThe mineral products are iron, slate, basalt, limestone, laterite boulders, and a shale containing vegetable remains. There are no forests. The hills in the B\u0101d\u0101mi and Hungund Sub-divisions are covered with low brushwood, only fit for fuel. The wild animals include leopards, hog, antelope, wolves, and jackals.\n\nHistory.\u2014Seven places within the limits of the District,\u2014Aivalli in B\u0101d\u0101mi, B\u0101d\u0101mi, B\u0101galkot, Dhulkhed in Indi, Galgali in Kal\u0101dgi, Hippargi in Sindgi, and M\u0101h\u0101kuta in B\u0101d\u0101mi,\u2014are illustrated by legends of sages and demons, perhaps in memory of early fights between northern invaders and local chiefs. These legends describe these places as within the Dandaka forest or Dandak\u0101ranya. The District in the second century A.D. seems to have contained at least three places of sufficient consequence to be noted in the place lists of Ptolemy, namely, B\u0101d\u0101mi, Indi, and Kaikeri. So far as is known, the oldest place in Bij\u0101pur is B\u0101d\u0101mi, a Pallava stronghold. About the middle of the sixth century the early Chalukya Pulikeshi I. wrested B\u0101d\u0101mi from the Pallavas. From the Chalukya conquest of B\u0101d\u0101mi to the Muhammadan invasion, the history of the District includes four periods,\u2014an early Chalukya and Western Chalukya period lasting to about 760 A.D.; a R\u0101shtrakuta period from 760 to 973; a Western Chalukya, Kalachuri, and Hoysala Ball\u0101la period from 973 to 1190, with Sinda underlords in South Bij\u0101pur from 1120 to 1180; and a Devagiri Y\u0101dava period from 1190 to the Muhammadan invasion of the Deccan at the close of the thirteenth century. In 1294, a Muhammadan army, led by Al\u0101-ud-d\u012bn, the nephew of Jal\u0101l-ud-d\u012bn Khilj\u012b, Emperor of Delhi, appeared in the Deccan, sacked Devagiri (the modern Daulat\u0101b\u0101d in the Niz\u0101m\u2019s territories, to which place the seat of government had been removed from Bij\u0101pur during the Y\u0101dava period), stripped R\u0101mchandra (the\nninth king of the Y\u00e1dava line) of his wealth, and forced him to acknowledge the supremacy of the Delhi Emperor. In the middle of the fifteenth century, Yusaf Adil Sh\u00e1h founded an independent Muhammadan State with Bij\u00e1pur for his capital. From this time, the history of the District is that of the town of Bijapur (q.v.).\n\nThe great Chinese pilgrim and traveller Hwen Thsang visited B\u00e1d\u00e1mi, then the seat of the Chalukya dynasty. He described the people as tall, proud, simple, honest, grateful, brave, and exceedingly chivalrous; the king as proud of his army and his hundreds of elephants, despising and slighting the neighbouring kingdoms; the capital full of convents and temples with relic mounds or stupas made by King Asoka, where the four past Buddhas had sat, and, in performing their exercises, had left the marks of their feet; heretics of various sects were numerous, the men loved study and followed the teachings of both heresy and truth. He estimated the kingdom as nearly twelve hundred miles (6000 li) in circumference.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1872 returned the population at 816,273 persons; the Census of 1881 at 638,493, showing a decrease of 177,780 persons, or more than 20 per cent., in nine years, attributable to the famine of 1876-78. Average density of population, 111 persons per square mile; number of towns, 11; villages, 1130; occupied houses, 114,533; unoccupied houses, 40,086; houses per square mile, 27; persons per house, 5\u00b757. Classified according to sex, there were 317,611 males and 320,882 females; proportion of males, less than 50 per cent. of the total population. There were, under 15 years\u2014males, 118,479, and females, 112,700; total, 231,179, or 36 per cent. of the population.\n\nOf the 1141 towns and villages in Kal\u00e1dgi District, 351 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 423 from two to five hundred; 230 from five hundred to one thousand; 93 from one to two thousand; 18 from two to three thousand; 15 from three thousand to five thousand; 8 from five to ten thousand; and 3 from ten to fifteen thousand.\n\nDistributed according to religion, the Census of 1881 yields the following returns:\u2014Hindus, 568,096, or 89 per cent. of the District population; Muhammadans, 67,066, or 10\u00b75 per cent.; Jains, 2679; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 26; Christians, 625; and Buddhist, 1. The term Hindu embraces the following castes:\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 20,374; R\u00e1jputs, 4414; Kol\u00eds, agriculturists, 10,187; Kumb\u00e1s, agriculturists, 16,992; Berads, 21,262; Kosht\u00eds, 8010; Kumbh\u00e1rs, 5429; Loh\u00e1rs, smiths, 1349; Mal\u00eds, gardeners, 2265; Mangs and Dhers, 44,433; Son\u00e1rs, goldsmiths, 2273; Sutars, 2114; Tel\u00eds, oilmen, 36,952; Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds, 5010; Cham\u00e1rs, 3664; Darjis, 3250; Dh\u00e1ngars, 94,786; Dhab\u00eds, 3215; Hajj\u00e1ms, 6926; Jangams, 26,631; Ling\u00e1yats, 4377; Panchams\u00e1l\u00eds, 56,865; Raddis, 29,055; and \u2018others,\u2019 158,237. The Muham-\nmadans are composed as follows:\u2014Path\u00e1ns, 3090; Sayyids, 11,272; Shaikhs, 52,043; 'others,' 661. Of the Christians, 579 are natives.\n\nIn the Census of 1881, the males of the population were divided into six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every description and the learned professions, 10,402; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 1753; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 1318; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 165,640; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 38,321; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 100,177.\n\nAgriculture supports 485,164 persons, or 76 per cent. of the entire population. Thirty-seven per cent. of the agricultural population are actually engaged in tillage. The incidence of the State demand on each cultivable acre was, in 1881, 14s.; of local cess, \u00bed. The land of the District varies from a poor sandy and stony soil to a rich deep black loam; the tract lying along the banks of the river Dhon is noted for its richness and power of retaining moisture. The sandy soils are unsuited for cotton, wheat, grain, and other cold-weather crops, and yield only the common varieties of millet and pulse; but they are nevertheless, in the larger villages, well ploughed, manured, and weeded. In 1881, the area of uncultivable land in the District was 761 square miles; of cultivated, 4076 square miles; and of cultivable waste, 920 square miles. The agricultural stock in State villages amounted in 1881\u201382 to 49,761 ploughs, 8846 carts, 197,560 bullocks, 93,171 cows, 88,562 buffaloes, 7684 horses, 363,608 sheep and goats, and 5043 asses. The area of Government cultivable land bearing assessment was 2,170,859 acres, or 66 per cent. of the total, of which 143,806 acres were fallow or under grass. Of this cultivable area, 1,719,524 acres were under actual cultivation (317 acres being twice cropped), of which grain crops occupied 1,209,075 acres, or 68\u00b770 per cent.; pulses, 73,360 acres, or 4 per cent.; oil-seeds, 70,426 acres, or 3\u00b79 per cent.; fibres, 359,210 acres, or 20 per cent. (357,701 acres cotton); and miscellaneous crops, 7453 acres, or 4 per cent.\n\nAmong the agricultural products of the Districts, Indian millet or j\u00f3\u00e1r (Sorghum vulgare), grown both as a rainy-season and a fair-weather crop, held in 1881\u201382 the first place with 949,385 acres, or 53\u00b73 per cent. of the area under actual cultivation. It constitutes the chief food of the people; and, except in seasons of unusual abundance, the whole crop is consumed in the District. The other cereals of importance are, spiked millet or b\u00e1jra (Pennisetum typhoideum), occupying 136,924 acres, and wheat, covering 97,746 acres. The most valuable, and, next to millet, the most widely grown crop is cotton, occupying an area which, during the four years 1872\u201376, increased from\n184,102 to 289,480 acres. By 1882-83, the area under cotton had further increased to 351,844 acres. Castor-oil, linseed, safflower, and sesamum or til are grown and exported, safflower in considerable quantities. But little rice is produced, and what is grown is of an inferior variety. In some parts of the District, a careless system of tillage is followed, portions of many fields being allowed to lie waste and become choked with grass. With the growth of the population up to 1876, the area under cultivation steadily increased, and tracts which thirty years ago sheltered the more dangerous sorts of wild beasts are now tilled fields. Much land fell out of cultivation during the famine of 1876-78. It is being gradually resumed, but the amount under cultivation has not yet come up to its normal quantity.\n\nThe average wages earned in the District are 1s. 7\u00bdd. a day for skilled and 6\u00bcd. for unskilled labour; 2s. a day is paid for carts; 1s. 1d. for camels; 8\u00bcd. for pack bullocks; and from 1s. 6d. to 6s. for boats. The current prices of the chief articles of food during 1881-82 were\u2014for a rupee (2s.), jowar (Indian millet), 64 lbs. (3s. 6d. per cwt.); rice, 19 lbs. (11s. 9d. per cwt.); wheat, 42 lbs. (5s. 4d. per cwt.); and dal (split-pease), 36 lbs. (6s. 2d. per cwt.).\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Owing to its uncertain rainfall, Kaladgi is very subject to failure of crops and consequent scarcity of grain. Like the rest of the Deccan, this District was at the beginning of the 15th century left by the great famine of 1396-1406 almost utterly waste and deserted; and in 1791, it again suffered grievously from the want of rain\u2014still remembered by the people as the Skull Famine, the ground being covered with the skulls of the unburied dead. In 1803, the Pindaris stripped the country of food, and the price of millet rose to 4 lbs. per rupee (56s. per cwt.). In 1818-19, a failure of rain caused great distress, and raised the price of millet to 12 lbs. per rupee, or 18s. 8d. per cwt. Other years of drought and scarcity were 1824-25, 1832-33, 1853-54, 1863-64, and 1866-67. Finally, in 1876-77, the failure of rain was more complete and general in Kaladgi than in any other part of the Bombay Presidency. The price of millet rose to 9 lbs. per rupee (2s.), and the price of wheat to 5 lbs.\n\nA special Census, taken on the 19th May 1877, when the famine was general and severe, showed that of 72,451 workers on public works, 3320 were manufacturers or craftsmen, 23,688 were holders or under-holders of land, and 45,443 were labourers. The total cost of the famine was estimated at \u00a3258,376, of which \u00a3230,873 was spent on public works, and \u00a327,503 on charitable relief. The estimated loss of population caused by death and emigration is 234,841. The number of cattle decreased from 741,291 in 1875-76 to 437,716\nin 1878-79, a loss of 303,575 head. The tillage area fell from 2,084,721 acres in 1875-76 to 2,078,796 acres in 1878-79.\n\nIn 1879 the District suffered from a plague of rats, which destroyed about one-half of the crops by eating off the millet heads and the cotton pods, and biting the wheat stalks close to the ground. The ravages of the rats continued throughout the year, and threatened the general destruction of the early crops. Active measures were taken to reduce their numbers; no fewer than 4,130,209 were destroyed.\n\nManufactures and Commerce.\u2014A large proportion of the people earn a living as weavers, and the peasants add to their income by the sale of home-spun cotton thread. The chief manufactures of the District are cotton and silk cloth. In addition to what is used in the District, considerable quantities of cloth are sent to Shol\u00e1pur, Poona (P\u00fana), Belg\u00e1um, and the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s territory. Of late years, the number of handlooms is said to have increased. Blankets are woven to a considerable extent, and are in considerable demand as far as Bombay. Large quantities of cotton yarn and cloth are also dyed and exported. Except the coppersmiths, whose wares are sent out of the District, none of the Kal\u00e1dgi artisans have a name for special skill in their crafts. The chief articles of import are piece-goods and rice from Shol\u00e1pur, cocoa-nuts and salt from the coast, betel-nut and spices from K\u00e1nara, and molasses from Belg\u00e1um. In all sub-divisional stations, and in some other of the larger villages, a weekly market is held. Am\u00edngarh is a great mart for cattle and coast produce. There are 11 towns with a population of over 5000. The chief of these are B\u00e1galkot, Bij\u00e1pur, Guledgad, Ilkal, Kal\u00e1dgi, T\u00e1l\u00edkot, and Hungund. Thirty years ago, there were no cart roads in Kal\u00e1dgi; but in 1881-82, the number of carts was returned at 8846, and the main centres of trade are now connected by fair-weather roads. The East Deccan line of the South Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 railway system also passes through the District via the towns of Indi, Bij\u00e1pur, B\u00e1galkot, and B\u00e1d\u00e1mi.\n\nBesides the local trading classes, there is a large body of Gujar\u00e1th\u00ed and M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri money-lenders and cloth merchants in the District.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The first settlement of the District took place in 1843-44. The total revenue of Kal\u00e1dgi in 1882-83, under all heads, imperial, local, and municipal, amounted to \u00a3160,976, or, on a population of 638,493, an incidence per head of 5s. 0\u00bdd. The land-tax forms the principal source of revenue, producing \u00a3119,642. Other important items are excise (\u00a312,282), stamps (\u00a35896), and local funds. The District local funds created since 1863 for works of public utility and rural education yielded in 1881-82 a total sum of \u00a314,127. There are (1882) 4 municipalities, containing an aggregate population of 40,872 persons. Their total receipts (1882-83) are returned at \u00a32389, and the incidence of taxation varies from 7\u00bdd. to 1s. 6d. a head.\nThe administration of the District in revenue matters is entrusted to a Collector and four Assistants, of whom three are covenanted civilians. The number of fiscal Sub-divisions is eight. For judicial purposes, Kal\u00e1dgi is included in the jurisdiction of the Judge of Belg\u00e1um. There are 4 civil courts. Twenty-two officers share the administration of criminal justice in 24 criminal courts. The total strength of the regular police consisted in 1881\u201382 of 3359 officers and men, or 1 to every 190 of the population; total cost, \u00a39945, or \u00a31, 14s. 6d. per square mile of area and 3\u00bdd. per head of population. The number of persons convicted of any offence, great or small, was 1315, being 1 person to every 485 of the population. There is one District jail. Education has widely spread of late years. In 1855\u201356 there were only 9 schools, with 395 pupils. By 1876\u201377 the number of schools had risen to 137, attended by 6236 pupils, or, on an average, 1 school to every 8 villages. In 1882\u201383 there were\u2014schools, 182; pupils, 10,612. On an average there is a village school to every 32 square miles. One vernacular newspaper was published in the District in 1882\u201383.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The rainfall in Kal\u00e1dgi is very uncertain. The average during the five years ending with 1876 was 22 inches. The prevailing diseases are fever, rheumatism, guinea-worm, and cholera. A civil hospital at Kal\u00e1dgi town and 5 dispensaries afforded medical relief to 352 in-door and 21,853 out-door patients in 1881\u201382, and 13,338 persons were vaccinated. The births registered in 1881 numbered 19,580; deaths, 13,517: death-rate, 21 per thousand.

The zamind\u00e1r of K\u00e1lahasti at one time could bring into the field a contingent of over 5000 men. His revenues are estimated at between \u00a340,000 and \u00a350,000 per annum. The country is in a great measure covered with scrub jungle, especially the portion in North Arcot District, from which Madras city is supplied with firewood. Half of the tract is reported to be cultivated; the soil is a red clay mixed with sand. There are few wells. For rent the zamind\u00e1r takes one-half of the produce. Copper, iron, and limestone are found. Glass-making is a staple industry. There are 51 miles of road.\n\nThe history of the estate is obscure. The first p\u00e1leg\u00e1r, or hereditary chief, was of the Vellama caste, and probably received the grant from one of the Vijayanagar kings in the 15th century. The estate at one time spread as far as the site now occupied by Fort St. George. The chief has been created C.S.I., and the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1 has been bestowed upon him.\n\nK\u00e1lahasti (Sri K\u00e1lastri, Calastri).\u2014Town in North Arcot District, Madras Presidency; situated in lat. 13\u00b0 45' 2\" N., and long. 79\u00b0 44' 29\" E., on the right bank of the Suvannamukki river, 16 miles north-east of Tripati (Tirup\u00e1ti) station on the Madras Railway, north-west line.

In its extensive suburbs a good deal of cloth is woven. Grain, bangles, and the like commodities are the chief articles of trade. A magnificent festival called Sivar\u00e1tri is held in March and continues for ten days. The great temple to P\u00e1rvat\u00ed cannot be entered by Europeans. The centre of the old town is occupied by a square filled with houses, around which four broad streets run, meeting one another at right angles. To the east and north-east the town has been extended irregularly. The temple, dedicated to Siva, from which the chief importance of the town is\nderived, stands at the base of the southern hill, and near the south-west angle of the central square.\n\n**K\u00e1lai.**\u2014Port in the Umbarg\u00e1m customs division of Th\u00e1n\u00e1 District, Bombay Presidency.

Although it still presents to some extent the character of a river, it is so broken up by diverging, re-uniting, and interlacing channels, that it is almost impossible to determine where it begins or what is its course. It may, however, be considered to have its rise under the name of the Kaml\u00e1, near R\u00e1n\u00edganj, in the north of the District; whence it flows southward to Purniah town, where it receives its principal tributary, the Saur\u00e1. Below Purniah it continues a southward course, often by several channels, until it falls into the Ganges (lat. 25\u00b0 16' 45\" N., long. 87\u00b0 43' 30\" E.) south-east of Manih\u00e1ri police station, opposite S\u00e1hibganj.\n\n**Kalale.**\u2014Village in Mysore District, Mysore State, Southern India.

For the last few miles of its course it forms the boundary between the Districts of Nowgong and K\u00e1mrup. Its tributaries\u2014all on the south or left bank\u2014are the Mis\u00e1, Diju, Nan\u00e1i, Kapili, Kiling, and Digru. The principal towns and centres of traffic are Nowgong, Rah\u00e1, and Ch\u00e1pari-mukh. Since 1858, a large sandbank has formed at the exit of the Kalang from the Brahmaputra, which obstructs navigation during the greater part of the year. In the rainy season, the Kalang has a depth of 26 feet of water. A little south of Nowgong town are two large bils or marshes, known as Mari Kalang and Pot\u00e1 Kalang, which have evidently been formed by changes in the course of this river. There is an important ferry at Rah\u00e1.\n\nKalan Kot (or Kalia Kot, K\u00e1la Kot).\u2014Ruins of an ancient fort in the Jerruck (Jh\u00edr\u00e1k) Sub-division of Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. It is seated on a limestone hill, which abounds in marine shells, and is everywhere honeycombed with natural cavities. Said to have been built in the 15th century, on the site of a still more ancient stronghold. It must have been of great strength, and the remains seem to show that it was destroyed by fire. The fort is three miles south of Tatta.\n\nKalaro\u00e1.\u2014Town and head-quarters of a police circle (th\u00e1n\u00e1), Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated on the Betn\u00e1 river.

The town is famous in local legend as being the place where a W\u00e1la R\u00e1jput married a daughter of a K\u00e1thi, and thus formed the present tribe of W\u00e1la-K\u00e1this. It was noted as far back as 1780 for fine dangari, or coarse cotton cloth, worn by R\u00e1j\u00e1s and great chiefs before the introduction of English calico. K\u00e1l\u00e1w\u00e1r is a walled town.\n\n**Ka-le-gauk.**\u2014Island off the coast of Amherst District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. It is 50 miles long, and runs north by west and south by east, with its northern extremity 30 miles from Cape Amherst. The northern half of the island is described as consisting of \u2018a long granite ridge, with a perpendicular drop to the sea.\u2019 The western side is broken into abrupt hills, with level, well-raised, intervening spaces forming three bays; one of which, Quarry Bay, furnished the stones for the Alguada Reef lighthouse.

Lat. 22\u00b0 31' 30\" N., long. 88\u00b0 23' E. The temple in honour of K\u00e1l\u00ed, the wife of Siva, derives sanctity from the following legend. Her dead body was carried all over the world by her disconsolate husband, until at length the corpse was cut in pieces by Vishnu with his sacred disc (*sudarsan chakra*), and the 52 places where the different parts of the body fell became sacred as places of pilgrimage. One of her fingers is said to have fallen at this spot. The temple was built about three centuries ago by a member of the S\u00e1barna Chaudh\u00e1r\u00ed family, who allotted 194 acres of land for its maintenance. A Br\u00e1hman named Chandib\u00e1r was the first priest appointed to manage the affairs of the shrine; and his descendants, who have taken the title of H\u00e1ld\u00e1r, are the present proprietors. They have amassed great wealth, not so much from the endowments as from the daily offerings made by pilgrims. The principal religious festival of the year is on the second day of the *Durg\u00e1-p\u00faj\u00e1*, when the temple is visited by crowds of pilgrims from all parts of the District.\n\n**K\u00e1l\u00edkot (Kolikodu).**\u2014T\u00e1luk and town in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Calicut.\n\n**Kalimiyar Point (Kalli-medu, T\u00e1mil).**\u2014Madras Presidency.\u2014See Calimere.\nK\u00e1limpong.\u2014Hill tract of D\u00e1rijiling District, Bengal.\u2014See Dalingkot.\n\nK\u00e1l\u00ed Nadi, East (properly K\u00e1lindi).\u2014River in Muzaffarnagar, Meerut (Merath), Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Etah, and Farukhabad Districts, North-Western Provinces. Rises in Muzaffarnagar District, east of the Ganges Canal, and between that channel and the great sandridge of Sar\u00e1i. During the earlier part of its course it bears the name of N\u00edgan, and forms an ill-defined waterway, running through grassy fields. Lower down it gradually expands, and in the latitude of Bulandshahr becomes a perennial stream, running southward through a valley marked by high banks, and draining the whole eastern portion of the Do\u00e1b. Its channel here is very tortuous. At Khurj\u00e1 the river trends south-eastward, and holds the same direction for the remainder of its course until it falls into the Ganges, in lat. $27^\\circ 1' \\text{N.}$, and long. $80^\\circ \\text{E.}$, a few miles from Kanauj. The valley is inundated almost every year, but no injury is caused thereby, as the lands are seldom sown with any but winter crops. The fertility of the valley was temporarily destroyed a few years after the opening of the Ganges Canal by the appearance of a saline efflorescence said to be due to the rise of the spring level in consequence of the escapes by which the waste water of the canal distributaries was let into the river. In a large number of villages the revenue assessment was reduced, but as soon as the escapes were closed, the soil recovered itself, and the revenue was again raised. In Bulandshahr District the river is crossed by a handsome masonry bridge of nine arches at Bulandshahr town, and also by a bridge erected by a local landholder at Gulaothi on the road to Garhmukhtesar. In Al\u00edgarh District there are three permanent bridges. The water of the river is very little employed for irrigation, on account of its great depth below the surface. The total length of the East K\u00e1l\u00ed Nadi is about 310 miles.\n\nK\u00e1l\u00ed Nadi, West.\u2014River in Sah\u00e1ranpur and Muzaffarnagar Districts, North-Western Provinces; rises 16 miles south of the Siw\u00e1lik Hills, at an elevation of about 1000 feet above sea-level, and flows with a general south-westerly course to join the Hindan. Lat. (point of junction) $29^\\circ 19' \\text{N.}$, long. $77^\\circ 40' \\text{E.}$; total length, about 70 miles.\n\nK\u00e1lind\u00ed.\u2014A distributary of the Jamun\u00e1 river, Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal. It branches off from the parent stream at Basantpur, whence it flows in a southerly direction through the Sundarbans, and falls into the R\u00e1imangal in lat. $22^\\circ 7' \\text{N.}$, and long. $89^\\circ 5' 30'' \\text{E.}$ Some distance above the point where the Jamun\u00e1 falls into the same estuary, about seven miles below Basantpur, the K\u00e1lind\u00ed throws off a small creek, which, communicating with the K\u00e1l\u00edg\u00e1chh\u00ed and Ath\u00e1rab\u00e1nk\u00e1 rivers in the Sundarbans, and joining the Bidyadh\u00e1ri, forms the track for the large\nboats from Calcutta to the eastward. The K\u00e1lind\u00ed is a fine deep river, averaging 300 feet in breadth.\n\n**K\u00e1lindri** (or **K\u00e1lindi**).\u2014River of Northern Bengal, an offshoot or distributary of the Kus\u00ed in Purniah District, entering Maldah about six miles north of Hai\u00e1tpur town, near which place a natural connection has been effected with the Ganges. The main stream, however, runs a winding course in a south-easterly direction past Hai\u00e1tpur for 20 miles, till it joins the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1 at Maldah town, in lat. $25\u00b0\\ 2' \\ 30''$ N., long. $88\u00b0\\ 10' \\ 15''$ E. It receives no tributaries of any importance, the drainage of the neighbouring country being carried off by means of small creeks or *n\u00e1l\u00e1s*, which only contain water in the rainy season. The river is not wide, but flows in a very deep channel between banks of hard red clay, nowhere fordable during the rains. Owing to its connection with the Ganges at Hai\u00e1tpur, the river is now divided into two branches, the Upper and the Lower K\u00e1lindri. The river bed of the Lower K\u00e1lindri is now silting up at its mouth where it joins the Ganges; and throughout its channel to its junction with the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1, it is throwing up great sandbanks. Both the K\u00e1lindri and Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1 have much deteriorated in consequence during the eight years from 1875 to 1883.\n\n**Kaling\u00e1** (or **Caling\u00e1**).\u2014One of the nine kingdoms of Southern India in ancient times. Its exact limits varied, but included the Eastern Madras coast, from Pulicat to Chicacole, running inland from the Bay of Bengal to the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts. The name at one time had a wider and vaguer meaning, comprehending Orissa, and possibly extending to the Ganges valley. A modern authority speaks more narrowly of it as \u2018the country on the coast of the Bay of Bengal, south of Orissa.\u2019 The Kaling\u00e1 of Pliny certainly included Orissa, but latterly it seems to have been confined to the Telugu-speaking country; and in the time of Hwen Tsiang (A.D. 630) it was distinguished on the west from Andhra, and on the north from Odra or Orissa. The language of the country is Telugu. T\u00e1ran\u00e1tha, the Tibetan historian, speaks of Kaling\u00e1 as one division of the country of Telinga. Hwen Tsiang speaks of Kaling\u00e1 (\u2018Kie-ling-kia\u2019) having its capital at what may now be identified with the site either of R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri (R\u00e1jah-mundry) or Coringa. Both these towns, as well as Singhapur, Kaling\u00e1-patam, and Chicacole, divide the honour of having been the chief cities of Kaling\u00e1 at different periods. The modern Kalingia gh\u00e1t, Kaling\u00e1-patam, and Coringa may be taken as traces of the old name.\n\nThe following account of Kaling\u00e1, as described by Hwen Tsiang in 639\u201340 A.D., is condensed from General Cunningham\u2019s *Ancient Geography of India*, vol. i. p. 515:\n\n\u2018In the 7th century, the capital of the kingdom of Kie-ling-kia, or Kaling\u00e1, was situated at from 1400 to 1500 li, or from 233 to 250\nmiles, to the south-west of Ganj\u00e1m. Both bearing and distance point either to R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri on the God\u00e1var\u00ed river, or to Coringa on the sea-coast; the first being 251 miles to the south-west of Ganj\u00e1m, and the other 246 miles in the same direction. But as the former is known to have been the capital of the country for a long period, it seems to be the place that was visited by the Chinese pilgrim. The original capital of Kaling\u00e1 is said to have been Sr\u00edk\u00e1kulam, or Chicacole, 20 miles to the south-west of Kaling\u00e1patam. The kingdom was 5000 li, or 833 miles, in circuit. Its boundaries are not stated; but as it was united to the west by Andhra, and to the south by Dhan\u00e1kakata, its frontier line cannot have extended beyond the God\u00e1var\u00ed river on the south-west, and the Gaoliya branch of the Indr\u00e1vati river on the north-west. Within these limits, the circuit of Kaling\u00e1 would be about 800 miles. The principal feature in this large tract of country is the Mahendra range of mountains, which has preserved its name unchanged from the time of the composition of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata to the present day. This range is mentioned also in the Vishnu Pur\u00e1na as the source of the Rishikuilya river; and as this is the well-known name of the river of Ganj\u00e1m, the Mahendra Mountains can at once be identified with the Mahendra Mal\u00e9 range, which divides Ganj\u00e1m from the valley of the Mah\u00e1nadi.\n\n'R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri was the capital of the junior or eastern branch of the Chalukya princes of Vengi, whose authority extended to the frontiers of Orissa. The kingdom of Vengi was established about 540 A.D. by the capture of the old capital of Vengipura, the remains of which still exist at Vengi, 5 miles to the north of Ellore, and 50 miles west-south-west of R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri. About 750 A.D., Kaling\u00e1 was conquered by the R\u00e1ja of Vengi, who shortly afterwards moved the seat of Government to R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri.\n\n'The Caling\u00e6 are mentioned by Pliny as occupying the eastern coast of India, below the Mandei and Malli, and the famous Mount Maleus. This mountain may perhaps be identified with the high range at the head of the Rishikuliya river in Ganj\u00e1m, which is still called Mahendra Mal\u00e9, or the Mahendra Mountain. To the south, the territory of the Caling\u00e6 extended as far as the promontory of Calingon and the town of Dandaguda, or Dandagula, which is said to be 625 Roman miles, or 574 British miles, from the mouth of the Ganges. Both the distance and the name point to the great port-town of Coringa as the promontory of Calingon, which is situated on a projecting point of land at the mouth of the God\u00e1var\u00ed river. The town of Dandaguda, or Dandagula, seems to be the D\u00e1ntapura of the Buddhist chronicles, which, as the capital of Kaling\u00e1, may with much probability be identified with R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri, only 30 miles to the north-east of Coringa.\nA still earlier name for the capital of Kaling\u00e1 was Sinhapura, so called after its founder, Sinhabahu, the father of Vij\u00e1ya, the first recorded sovereign of Ceylon. Its position is not indicated, but there still exists a large town of this name on the Lalgla river, 115 miles to the west of Ganj\u00e1m, which is very probably the same place.\n\nIn the inscriptions of the K\u00e1lachuri or Haihaya dynasty of Chedi, the R\u00e1j\u00e1s assume the titles of Lords of K\u00e1lanjjwrapura and of Tri-Kaling\u00e1. K\u00e1linjar is the well-known hill fort in Bundelkhand; and Tri-Kaling\u00e1, or the \u201cThree Kaling\u00e1s,\u201d must be the three kingdoms of Dhanaka or Amar\u00e1vati (on the Kistna), Andhra or Warangal, and Kaling\u00e1 or R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri. The name of Tri-Kaling\u00e1 is probably old, as Pliny mentions the Macco-Caling\u00e6 and the Gangarides-Caling\u00e6 as separate peoples from the Caling\u00e6, while the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata names the Kaling\u00e1s three separate times, and each time in conjunction with different peoples. As Tri-Kaling\u00e1 thus corresponds with the great Province of Teling\u00e1na, it seems probable that the name of Teling\u00e1na may be only a slightly contracted form of Tri-Kaling\u00e1na, or the \u201cThree Kaling\u00e1s.\u201d\n\nKaling\u00e1patam (Caling\u00e1patam).\u2014Town and port in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency; situated at the mouth of the Vamsadh\u00e1ra river, 16 miles north of Chicacole, in lat. 18\u00b0 20' 20\" N., and long. 84\u00b0 9' 50\" E. Population (1881) 4465. Hindus numbered 4334; Muhammadans, 95; Christians, 34; and \u2018others,\u2019 2. Area of town site, 1246 acres. The capital of the ancient Kaling\u00e1, and one of the early seats of Muhammadan Government in the Telugu country. Signs of its ancient greatness are still visible in the ruins of many mosques and other large buildings. After rain, a mound which covers the site of the old city gives up small gold coins of great age. Kaling\u00e1patam is again rising in importance as a harbour, being in the south-west monsoon the only safe roadstead along a stretch of 400 miles of coast; and it has become a regular port of call for steamers. The vessels of the British India Steam Navigation Company put in fortnightly. A lighthouse, 64 feet high, stands on a sandy point at the mouth of the river. The town lies between this point and the south bank of the stream. A reef of rocks extends from the shore half a mile seawards. In passing, vessels ought not to approach nearer than 50 feet. Greatest depth over the bar, 14 feet 6 inches. In 1880\u201381, imports were valued at \u00a311,259, and exports of rice, seeds, and sugar at \u00a3131,916. Kaling\u00e1patam is one of the four salt factories of Ganj\u00e1m District. The manufacture of salt is by evaporation; the pans cover an area of 306 acres, and yield a revenue of from 4 to 5 l\u00e1khs of rupees (\u00a340,000 to \u00a350,000): The country round the town is desolate and barren.\n\nKalingia.\u2014Gh\u00e1t or pass in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency;\nover which runs the only good cart road from G\u00famsar (Goomsur) into the Maliyas. Lat. 20\u00b0 6' N., long. 84\u00b0 30' E. The length of the ascent to the crest of the gh\u00e1t is 5 miles; gradient severe for heavily loaded carts, but strong bullocks or buffaloes take up a cart loaded to the extent of 600 lbs. easily; elevation, 2396 feet above sea-level.\n\nK\u00e1l\u00ednjar.\u2014Town and celebrated hill fort in Badausa tahs\u00edl, B\u00e1nda District, Bundelkhand, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 25\u00b0 1' N., long. 80\u00b0 31' 35'' E. Situated on a rocky hill, in the extreme south of B\u00e1nda District, 33 miles south of B\u00e1nda town. The fort occupies a site at the extremity of a spur of the Bind\u00e1chal range, the first and lowest terrace of the Vindhyan system, commanding the Bundelkhand plain. It rises abruptly, and is separated from the nearest eminence by a valley about 1200 yards wide. Elevation, 1230 feet. The crown of the hill is a plateau with an almost perpendicular scarp on all sides; at weak points the rock has been cut away and was formerly defended by artificial works. Vast polyhedral masses of syenite form the base of the hill, and afford a comparatively accessible slope; but the horizontal strata of sandstone which cap the whole, present so bold an escarpment as to be practically impossible of ascent.\n\nK\u00e1l\u00ednjar is one of the very ancient forts of Bundelkhand, and separate names for it are recorded in each of the three prehistoric periods of Hindu chronology. It is said to have been called Ratnakuta in the Satya-y\u00faga, Mah\u00e1giri ('the great hill') in the Treta, and Ping\u00e1l\u00fa (the 'brown-yellow' hill) in the Dv\u00e1dp\u00e1ra-y\u00faga. Other accounts transpose or vary these names. But its present appellation, K\u00e1l\u00ednjar, is itself of great antiquity. It occurs, as will be mentioned hereafter, in the Mah\u00e1-bh\u00e1rata; it is conjectured to appear in Ptolemy under the Greek guise of Kanagora; and it is mentioned in the Sh\u00e9o Pur\u00e1na as one of the nine utkals, from which will burst forth the waters that are to finally destroy the world. The modern name is sometimes rendered K\u00e1lanj\u00e1r, from the local worship of Siva under his title of K\u00e1lanj\u00e1r, or 'He who causes time to grow old.' It was a very ancient seat of Sivaite rites, and according to local tradition was strongly fortified, probably not for the first time, by Chandra Brim or Varmma, the legendary founder of the Chandel dynasty, who is variously assigned to the 4th and 7th centuries of the Samvat era, corresponding to the 3rd and 6th centuries A.D.\n\nAs in many other cases, K\u00e1l\u00ednjar was a high place sanctified by superstition, and fortified partly by nature and partly by art. The Mah\u00e1-bh\u00e1rata mentions it as already a famous city, and states that whoever bathes in the Lake of the Gods, the local place of pilgrimage, is as meritorious as he who bestows in charity one thousand cows. The hill must have been covered with Hindu temples before the erection of the fort, for the dates of inscriptions on the sacred sites\nare earlier than those on the gate of the fortress; and the ramparts consist largely of ornamental pillars, cornices, and other fragments of carved work, which evidently belonged to earlier edifices. Ferishta speaks of it as having been founded by K\u00e9d\u00e1r N\u00e1th, a reputed contemporary of the Prophet, in the 7th century A.D. The Musalm\u00e1n historians make mention of the King of K\u00e1l\u00ednjar as an ally of Jaip\u00e1l, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Lahore, in his unsuccessful invasion of Ghazn\u00ed, 978 A.D. A R\u00e1j\u00e1 of K\u00e1l\u00ednjar was also present at the battle of Pesh\u00e1war, fought by Anand P\u00e1l in 1008, when endeavouring to check the victorious advance of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed in his fourth expedition. In 1021, Nanda, then R\u00e1j\u00e1 of K\u00e1l\u00ednjar, defeated the King of Kanauj, and in the following year, Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed besieged the fort, but came to terms with the R\u00e1j\u00e1. The Chandel clan of R\u00e1jputs removed the seat of their government to K\u00e1l\u00ednjar, after their defeat by Prithwi R\u00e1j\u00e1, the Chauh\u00e1n ruler of Delhi, about 1192. In 1202, Kutab-ud-d\u00edn, the viceroy of Muhammad Ghor\u00ed, took K\u00e1l\u00ednjar, and \u2018converted the temples into mosques and abodes of goodness,\u2019 while \u2018the very name of idolatry was annihilated.\u2019 But the Musalm\u00e1ns do not seem long to have retained possession of their new conquest, for in 1234, and again in 1251, we hear of fresh Muhammadan attacks on K\u00e1l\u00ednjar, which fell into the hands of Malik Nasirat-ud-d\u00edn Mahm\u00fad with great booty.\n\nIn 1247, Sult\u00e1n N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn Mahm\u00fad brought the surrounding country under his sway; but even after this date, Chandel inscriptions erected in the fort show that it remained in the hands of its ancient masters almost up to the close of the 13th century. K\u00e1l\u00ednjar next reappears in history in 1530, when the Mughal Prince Hum\u00e1y\u00fan laid siege to the fort, which he continued intermittently to attack during twelve years. In 1554, the Afgh\u00e1n Sher Sh\u00e1h marched against the stronghold; during the siege a live shell rebounded from the walls into the battery where the Sult\u00e1n stood, and set fire to a quantity of gunpowder. Sher Sh\u00e1h was brought out horribly burnt, and died the following day. Before his death, however, he ordered an assault, which took place immediately, with success, and his son Jal\u00e1l was crowned in the captured citadel. Copper coins of Sher Sh\u00e1h exist, which are inscribed as having been struck at K\u00e1l\u00ednjar. In 1570, Majn\u00fan Kh\u00e1n attacked the fort, which was finally surrendered to him for Akbar, who constituted it the head-quarters of a Sark\u00e1r. Under Akbar, K\u00e1l\u00ednjar formed a j\u00e1g\u00edr of the imperial favourite, R\u00e1j\u00e1 B\u00edrbal. Later it fell into the hands of the Bundelas (see Banda District); and on the death of their national hero, Chhatar S\u00e1l, it passed into the possession of Hardeo Sah of Pann\u00e1. His descendants continued to hold it for four generations, when they gave way to the family of K\u00e1\u00edm J\u00ed, one of their own dependants.\n\nDuring the period of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 supremacy, Al\u00ed Bah\u00e1dur laid\nsiege to the fort for two years, but without success. After the British occupation, Dary\u00e1u Singh, the representative of K\u00e1im Ji, was confirmed in possession of the fort and territory; but on his proving contumacious in 1812, a force under Colonel Martindell attacked K\u00e1l\u00ednjar, and although the assault met with little success, Dary\u00e1u Singh surrendered eight days later, receiving an equal portion of territory in the plains. During the Mutiny, a small British garrison retained possession of the fort throughout the whole rebellion, though isolated from all assistance. In 1866 the fortifications were dismantled.\n\nK\u00e1l\u00ednjar is still a place of much interest to the antiquary. Seven gateways, leading one to the other, many of them bearing inscriptions, in some cases undecipherable, afford access to the fort from the north. Tanks, caves, temples, tombs, and statues cover the platform on every side. They belong to very different dates, and will be more fully referred to below.\n\nThe town or village of K\u00e1l\u00ednjar, locally called Taraht\u00ed, is situated at the foot of the hill. The population appears to be gradually decreasing, being returned at 4057 in 1865, 4019 in 1872, and 3706 in 1881. The inhabitants are principally Br\u00e1hmans and K\u00e1chhis; but on occasions of religious fairs and festivals, Baniy\u00e1s and dealers of every description resort here, as also pilgrims from distant parts of India. There are a few wealthy mah\u00e1jans or merchants in the town, and the inhabitants generally are in comfortable circumstances, but their houses and surroundings are mean. For police and conservancy purposes, a small house-tax is levied. A travellers\u2019 bungalow for the use of European visitors is situated near the east entrance to the town, which also contains two markets, an Anglo-vernacular school, and a branch dispensary.\n\nIn the town of K\u00e1l\u00ednjar, and at the base of the hill, are many Muhammadan tombs and mosques bearing inscriptions, but these are of little interest compared with the Hindu remains. At the base of the hill on the north-east is a tank named Sursari Ganga, hewn out of the solid rock. It is surrounded by steps composed of stones taken at random from ruins, and probably to a great extent from a temple which may have been here. Among them are capitals of pillars composed of figures of Chhatarbh\u00faj Vishnu similar to those in the temple of Nilkantha, and there are two large recumbent figures of Vishnu N\u00e1r\u00e1yana at corners of the tank. These seem to point to a temple having been at this place at one time. To the north-east of this tank, and about half-way up the hill, is a shrine of Balkhandeshwar Mah\u00e1deo, excavated in one huge boulder, which stands out on the slope.\n\nThe ascent to the fort is made from the north, by a winding path cut out in the hill, and leading through seven gateways. The first is known as the Alam Darw\u00e1za, called after Alamg\u00edr or Aurangzeb. A Persian\ninscription on it gives 1084 A.H. as the year in which Aurangzeb repaired the fort. The path from this to the Ganesh (second) gate is termed the K\u00e1fir gh\u00e1t. It is steep and rough. The third gate, Chand\u00ed Darw\u00e1za, holds a stone set into it on the right, on which is an inscription in florid nail-headed Sanskrit characters not yet published. It records that Ratan constructed the building of which it originally formed part. Hence probably the name Ratnakuta. The fourth gate is called Balbhadra (also Budbhadr and Birbhadra), but it is in no way remarkable.\n\nA break in the wall beyond this admits of an ascent to the Kam-bhaur or Bhairan kund, a large tank about 45 yards long by 10 broad, hewn out of the rock. About 30 feet above it, on a projecting rock, is carved a gigantic figure of Bhairan. Below this is a cave cut in the rock at water-level, with square pillars for a support in front. The water, except in the hottest weather, covers the floor of the cave, which seems to have been intended as a cool retreat in the hot weather. There are inscriptions inside the cave, in which occur the names of Bari Varmma Dev\u00e1, of a Sri R\u00e1m Deo, son of Surhar Deo, of Mahila and of Jasdhaul, brother of J\u00e1hul, son of L\u00e1khan. The last is dated 1193 Samvat, and the names of L\u00e1khan and Mahila recall the wars of the Chauh\u00e1ns and Chandels. On a ledge of rock above these caves to the left is a figure of a Sramana and an inscription not yet fully deciphered.\n\nReturning to the path, the Hanum\u00e1n gate is next passed. Near this is the Hanum\u00e1n kund. There are many sculptures and inscriptions in this part of the fort, but most of the latter are illegible. One of these inscriptions would be of great value if wholly legible, as it seems to contain the names of several Chandel kings, but only those of Kirtti Varmma and Madana Varmma are distinct. The sixth gate is termed L\u00e1l Darw\u00e1za, and the seventh Sadr Darw\u00e1za. Beyond the main gate there is a dip in the rampart, leading to the S\u00edt\u00e1 Sej, also called R\u00e1m-sijjn, a stone couch in a small chamber hewn out of the rock. Tradition assigns this as a resting-place to S\u00edt\u00e1 on her return from Lanka; but an inscription over the door, cut in characters usually assigned to the 4th century, records that this cave was constructed by Hara, the Lord of the Hill, to perpetuate his name. Beyond this is the passage to P\u00e1t\u00e1lganga, a cave receding about 40 feet into the mountain, and about half as wide. The descent is steep and difficult. There are many inscriptions, but none have yet been found of historical importance. Beyond P\u00e1t\u00e1lganga is the Pandu kund, to the north-east of which is the breach made by Colonel Martindell. A path along the ramparts beyond the breach leads to the Buddhi Tal\u00e1o, a tradition connected with which would ascribe the fort to Kirtti Varmma; but the tradition is faulty, for the fort would thus date only\nfrom the seventh century. Beyond this are the Bhagw\u00e1n Sej and Pani-ki-Aman which call for no notice.\n\nThe Mrigdh\u00e1ra is a celebrated place on account of the seven deer cut in the rock which give it its name. There are also two rock chambers and a basin of water here. Pilgrims come and make offerings to the manes of the rishis whom these figures commemorate. The legend states that these were seven disciples who offended their religious instructor, and that they were cursed by him and born in their next life as Bahelias (hunters) in the Dasharan forest; in their next stage as deer at K\u00e1linjar; then as Br\u00e1hmini ducks in Ceylon, subsequently as geese at M\u00e1nsarowar lake, and finally as Br\u00e1hmans in Kurukshetra. In this last life they attained deliverance from transmigration.\n\nIt is supposed that the water at Mrigdh\u00e1ra comes by percolation from Kot T\u00edrath, but this seems unlikely on considering their relative positions. Kot T\u00edrath (properly Kror T\u00edrath, or \u2018ten million pilgrimages in one\u2019) is a large tank in the heart of the rock in the middle of the fort. Narrow flights of steps lead to the water, which is scanty except after heavy rain. Round this tank stones are found set into walls and steps, utterly misplaced, which contain inscriptions, sometimes incomplete and often too worn to be legible. On the bank are the Path\u00e1r Mah\u00e1l and other buildings, undoubtedly in great part antique, but partly restorations of older remains. There are many inscriptions inside these buildings, and a few outside set into the walls, but most have suffered by lime and whitewash. The oldest form of Sanskrit characters in the fort is to be found in inscriptions on two stones in the walls of the tank, but both are unfortunately incomplete.\n\nGoing on from the Kot T\u00edrath past Par\u00edm\u00e1l\u2019s baithak and Am\u00e1n Singh\u2019s mah\u00e1l, the gate on the south-west leading to N\u00edl Kantha is reached. The view which meets the eye on passing through this gate is magnificent. At foot is the breast of the hill, steep and rugged, hurrying as it were to the plain below. The B\u00e1nda-Nowgong road seems like a thread at its base; and beyond it as far as the eye can reach is a rich plain, cropped and green, dotted with hills here and there, broken sometimes by dried-up watercourses, and traversed by winding rivers which glisten like silver lines.\n\nDescending, another gate is passed, near which are inserted in the walls well-executed figures of Tulsi D\u00e1s, and of the Jain T\u00edrth\u00e1nkaras. To the left of this is a small building, which seems to be a later addition of stone and plaster, made by Muhammadan hands; but the rock against which it is set is cut with figures, and on removing the whitewash and plaster it is seen to have been covered with inscriptions. Further on, immediately before reaching N\u00edl Kantha are the Jata Shankar, the Shirs\u00e1g\u00e1r, the Tung Bhairan, and some caves. Inscriptions are numerous here. In one of the caves is an inscription which\nrecords that, on Chait Sudi 9, Somw\u00e1r, of 1192 Samvat, Narsingh, son of Ralhan, erected an image of B\u00e1md\u00e9o. A second inscription of his is dated Jeth Sudi 9, 1192 Samvat, and gives his grandfather's name as Dikshit Prithwidh\u00e1ra. A third inscription records that Sri Kirtti Varmma Deva and Someswar (the father of Prithwi R\u00e1j\u00e1) joined in salutation to the local deities. Another at Tung Bhairan records that Bachr\u00e1j, son of Mahasr\u00e1nik, son of Solhan, a servant of Madana Varma, set up an image of Lakhshmi on K\u00e1tik Sudi 6, Sainchar, in 1188 Samvat.\n\nThere are many well-executed figures, both Vaishnav and Saivik, all round this quarter, but they are little noticed in the presence of the more striking remains of the once beautiful temple of Nil Kantha Mah\u00e1deo. The pillars are well cut and surmounted by capitals composed of figures of Chhatarbh\u00faj Vishnu, but only one set of these pillars is now standing. Tradition states that there were originally seven sets of pillars, one above the other, forming seven storeys. This is not improbable, for similar capitals abound in irregular places throughout the fort, and these would no doubt suffice for the construction of such a temple. The site was well chosen. The building rising against the face of the hill must have looked superbly grand as viewed from the plain below. The pillars now left standing form with their basements an octagonal inclosure outside the door of a cave, in which is a massive linga with large silver eyes, called Nil Kantha Mah\u00e1deo. On the left-hand side of this cave is a very low narrow passage, filled with lingas, which is said to extend round the large cave, and communicate with a similar opening on the right. At the door of the temple are two large stones covered with inscriptions. The one which is complete adds nothing to our knowledge of the Chandels. The broken record on the other has yet to be completed and read in its entirety. The floor of the space between the pillars is covered with inscriptions, but they are all historically unimportant; chiefly names of pilgrims who recorded their visits, and salutations. In front are many sculptures lying displaced. The subjects are both Vaishnav (e.g. the Kurma avat\u00e1r, the ten avat\u00e1rs of Vishnu shown on one stone) and Saivik (e.g. Mah\u00e1deo with P\u00e1rvat\u00ed), and there is also a figure of Brahma.\n\nAbove the temple is a tank cut out of the solid rock. Four pillars are left as supports, and the opening is a long low horizontal cut, with a narrow terrace in front. Beyond this is a rock-cut figure of gigantic proportions, representing K\u00e1l Bhairan, with snakes for a head-dress, in which is set the moon. It is the largest figure in K\u00e1linjar, and must be 30 feet high. Formerly, a door below this figure led out to an inclosure in front of a perpendicular rock in which is a cave (Siddh-k\u00ed-gupha), but this gate has been closed by the British authorities, as there was a path below it opening on native territory.\nThere are many Muhammadan tombs on the fort; some inscribed, but these, as well as the relics of the Bundelas and Chaubes, are uninteresting, as they invite neither speculation nor research.\n\nThe town of Kalinjar, which lies below the hill, is not large. It was formerly enclosed; and three gates still stand, called the K\u00e1mt\u00e1, Pann\u00e1, and R\u00edw\u00e1 phataks, from the roads on which they open. [This account of Kalinjar has been given at considerable length, as it forms the most characteristic specimen of the strong places, originally hill-shrines converted into hill-fortresses, of Northern and North-Central India. The article has been amplified for the present edition from materials collected on the spot by William Hoey, Esq., C.S.]\n\nKalinjer\u00e1 (or Kanjr\u00e1). \u2014 Town in B\u00e1nsw\u00e1r\u00e1 State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Situated in lat. 23\u00b0 5' N. and long. 74\u00b0 7' E., on the route from Nimach (Neemuch) to Baroda, 99 miles south-west of the former and 139 north-east of the latter. Formerly a place of considerable trade, carried on by Jain merchants, who were driven away by Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 freebooters. Contains the ruins of a fine Jain temple, described by Heber as being built on a very complicated and extensive plan; covered with numerous domes and pyramids; divided into a great number of apartments, roofed with stone, crowded with images, and profusely embellished with rich and elaborate carvings.\n\nK\u00e1lip\u00e1n\u00ed. \u2014 Sacred spring in Kum\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces; regarded by the natives as the source of the river K\u00e1li, whose real head-waters lie 30 miles to the north-east. Lat. 30\u00b0 11' N., long. 80\u00b0 56' E. (Thornton). Situated on the slopes of the By\u00e1ns R\u00edkhi Mountain, 5 miles south-west of By\u00e1ns Pass, on the route to Askot. Pilgrims visit the spring to bathe in its purifying waters on their way to the sacred lake of M\u00e1nasarowar.\n\nK\u00e1l\u00ed Sind. \u2014 River of Central India; rises in lat. 22\u00b0 36' N., and long. 76\u00b0 19' E., in the Vindhya mountains. About 90 miles from its source, it receives, on the left, the Ludkunda, which also rises in the Vindhyas; and on the same side, about 60 miles farther down, it is joined by the Ah\u00fa and Amjar and Gagron. Near this place the K\u00e1l\u00ed Sind makes its way through the Mukandw\u00e1r\u00e1 (Mokundurra) range. Eventually, after a course of about 225 miles, it falls into the Chambal. About 50 miles from its junction with the Chambal at Kandg\u00e1on, the road from Kotah to S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) crosses the river.\n\nK\u00e1lj\u00e1n\u00ed. \u2014 River of Northern Bengal, formed by the combined waters of the Al\u00e1ikur\u00ed and Dim\u00e1 rivers, two streams rising in the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Hills, which unite near Al\u00edpur in the Western Dw\u00e1rs Sub-division of Jalp\u00e1iurg\u00ed District. From the point of junction the united river takes the name of K\u00e1lj\u00e1n\u00ed, and, after a course of a few miles, flows south through the east of Kuch Behar State, and finally joins the R\u00e1idhak in the extreme\nnorth-east corner of Rangpur District. Used to float down timber from the forests at the foot of the hills.\n\n**K\u00e1lka.**\u2014Village and camping ground in Simla District, Punjab. Lat. 30\u00b0 50' 21\" N., long. 76\u00b0 58' 57\" E.

Distance from Amb\u00e1l\u00e1, 38 miles; from Simla, 58 miles by cart road. The route to Simla here enters the hills, and travellers must leave the carriages in which they have come from Amb\u00e1l\u00e1. Several hotels, staging bungalow, post-office, telegraph office, sar\u00e1i. During the Simla season, the K\u00e1lka hotels do a thriving business, and native passengers to or from the hills throng the b\u00e1z\u00e1r. Elevation above sea-level, 2000 feet.\n\n**Kalladak\u00farichi.**\u2014Town in the Ambasamudaram t\u00e1luk of Tinnevelli District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 8\u00b0 40' 30\" N., long. 77\u00b0 30' 15\" E. Population (1871) 11,580; (1881) 10,936, namely, 5181 males and 5755 females; number of houses, 2520. Area of town site, 936 acres. Hindus numbered 9515; Muhammadans, 1383; and Christians, 38. A wealthy trading and agricultural town, situated on the T\u00e1mparani. The town derives its importance from the rich rice lands about it. Many of the inhabitants are wealthy and intelligent Br\u00e1hman landowners. Post-office.\n\n**Kallakurchi.**\u2014T\u00e1luk or Sub-division of South Arcot District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 11\u00b0 33' to 12\u00b0 4' 10\" N., long. 78\u00b0 42' to 79\u00b0 15' E. Situated in the south corner of the District. Area, 622 square miles. Population (1881) 196,029, namely, 96,962 males, and 99,067 females, dwelling in 368 villages, containing 27,355 houses. Hindus numbered 186,835; Muhammadans, 5806; and Christians, 3388. In 1883, the t\u00e1luk contained 2 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00fas), 8; regular police, 67 men. Land revenue, \u00a330,283.\n\n**Kallakurchi.**\u2014Head-quarters of the Kallakurchi t\u00e1luk of South Arcot District; lat. 11\u00b0 44' N., long. 79\u00b0 1' 20\" E. Area, 1465 acres.

Chief town, Kallikot. Population (1881) 3401. The estate has an area of 53,701 acres, or 84 square miles, and contains 238 villages, with a land revenue of \u00a31900. The family was founded by Rama Bhuiya, who was appointed zam\u00edn\u00e9d\u00e1r by Puru Shottama Gajpati Das, king of Orissa, in A.D. 1374. The country was occupied by British troops in 1769; and again, from 1771 to 1775, the\nEast India Company's agents and troops were employed in maintaining order. The adjoining taluk of Attigada was added to the estate by purchase in 1854, by the present zamindar.\n\nKallur.\u2014Pass in the Eastern Ghats, North Arcot District, Madras Presidency. The Kallur Pass leads from the lowland taluks to those above the ghats. It runs along the Damalcheruru valley, and through the Kallur paliyam or estate to the Piler taluk of Cuddapah. Along it passes the trunk road between Madras and Cuddapah. The traffic is considerable, though less than before the construction of the north-west line of the Madras Railway.\n\nKalmeshwar.\u2014Town in Nagpur District, Central Provinces. Lat. 21\u00b0 14' N., long. 78\u00b0 58' E.; situated 14 miles west of Nagpur city. Built on a low-lying plain of black soil, with a fertile country on the north and west, which produces opium, sugar-cane, and tobacco. Population, 4738 in 1872, and 5318 in 1881. Hindus numbered 4842; Kabirpanthis, 170; Muhammadans, 246; Jains, 31; Buddhist, 1; and aboriginal tribes, 28. In the centre of the town stands the old fort where the village proprietor, a Kunbi by caste, resides. It was built by a Hindu family from Delhi, who are said to have maintained, for the service of Bakht Buland, a force of 400 infantry and 100 cavalry. Kalmeshwar does a brisk trade in grain, oil-seeds, and country cloth. Eighty mills are engaged in pressing oil-seeds; and the cloth manufactured in the town finds a market in Berar. From the proceeds of the octroi duties, a commodious market-place has been constructed, with wide metalled roads leading towards Nagpur, Katol, Dhapewara, and Mohpa. The police station and school-house face the market-place.\n\nKalna (Culna).\u2014Sub-division of Bardwan District, Bengal, lying between 23\u00b0 7' and 23\u00b0 35' 45\" N. lat., and between 87\u00b0 59' and 88\u00b0 27' 45\" E. long. Area, 432 square miles, with 701 villages and towns, and 59,844 houses. Population in 1872, 286,338 persons; 1881, 237,607 persons, namely, 113,625 males and 123,982 females. Hindus numbered 175,855, or 74\u00b0 per cent.; Muhammadans, 61,739, or 26\u00b0 per cent.; and Christians, 13. Proportion of males, 47\u00b0 8 per cent.; average density of population, 550 persons per square mile; villages per square mile, 1\u00b0 81; persons per village, 338; houses per square mile, 1\u00b0 62; persons per house, 4\u00b0 3. This Sub-division, which was constituted in 1861, comprises the three police circles (thanas) of Kalna, Purbasthali, and Mantreswar. In 1881 it contained 1 civil and 3 criminal courts, including a municipal bench, and a bench of honorary magistrates; a regular police force 73 strong, besides a village or rural police of 1973 men.\n\nKalna (Culna).\u2014Town and head-quarters of Kalna Sub-division, and an important seat of trade in Bardwan District, Bengal; situated on the right bank of the Bhagirathi, in lat. 23\u00b0 13' 20\" N., and long. 88\u00b0 24' 30\" E.\nThe population, which in 1872 was returned at 27,336, had, according to the Census of 1881, dwindled down to 10,463. No explanation is given of the cause of this great decrease; but it is in all probability due in a large measure to the fever epidemic, which has been raging for many years throughout the Districts of the Bardw\u00e1n Division. Classified according to religion, the population of Kaln\u00e1 town in 1881 consisted of\u2014Hindus, 9023; Muhammadans, 1428; and Christians, 12. Area of town site, 2413 acres. The town, which is constituted a second-class municipality, yielded in 1882-83 a municipal income of \u00a3986, of which \u00a3850 was derived from taxation; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 7\u00bdd. per head. From ancient times Kaln\u00e1 carried on a very extensive river trade, as all imports into the District from Calcutta, and all exports to other Districts and to Calcutta, passed through the town. The competition of the East India Railway has not materially affected its prosperity, as it is still found cheaper to import from Calcutta by river than by rail. Large quantities of rice are imported from Din\u00e1jpur and Rangpur. The b\u00e1z\u00e1r, or business part of Kaln\u00e1, contains about a thousand houses, mostly built of brick. In Muhammadan times, a large fort, the ruins of which are still to be seen, commanded the river at this point. A good road connects Kaln\u00e1 with Bardw\u00e1n town; it was constructed in 1831 by the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bardw\u00e1n, and has bungalows, stables, and tanks at every eighth mile. The road was made chiefly with a view to the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s comfort when proceeding to bathe in the Ganges. The Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 has also a palace here, and has constructed some handsome temples in the town. Two fine mosques, now in a ruined condition, date from the time of Musalm\u00e1n supremacy. Kaln\u00e1 is a station of the Free Church Mission, and contains an English school.\n\nKaln\u00e1.\u2014One of the many channels of the Surm\u00e1 river in the southwest of Sylhet District, Assam, which all finally unite to form the main stream of the Meghn\u00e1.\n\nK\u00e1lol.\u2014Sub-division of Panch Mah\u00e1ls District, Bombay Presidency. The Sub-division, including the petty division of H\u00e1lol, is bounded on the north by Godhra; on the east by B\u00e1ria; on the south and west by Baroda (G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r\u2019s territory) and the P\u00e1ndu Mehw\u00e1s. Area, including H\u00e1lol petty division, 415 square miles. Population (1872) 66,431; (1881) 76,522, dwelling in 222 villages, and occupying 16,703 houses. The population is divided into 40,036 males and 36,486 females. Hindus numbered in 1881, 34,420 males and 31,145 females; total, 65,565; Muhammadans, 2551; and \u2018others,\u2019 8406. K\u00e1lol forms a rich well-wooded plain, its fields fenced with hedges and rows of brab palms, its villages compact and comfortable. Three rivers cross the Sub-division of K\u00e1lol proper from\neast to west\u2014the Mesri in the north, the Goma in the centre, and the Karad in the south. These rivers are torrents in the rains and trickling streams in the winter season. Light or goridd soil lies all over this part of the country: the black cotton soil is not met with. The petty division of H\u00e1lool is a well-wooded and tilled plain surrounding the hill fort of P\u00e1wagarh. To the east and south, low isolated hills stand out from a rich black soil plain, most of it waste. Especially within four or five miles of the hills, the climate is unhealthy and the water often deleterious. Three rivers, namely, the Karad, the Visw\u00e1mitri, and the Devn\u00e1d\u00ed, cross the country from east to west. Water in K\u00e1lol lies near the surface. Cultivation is rude, and the peasantry inert. Average annual rainfall, 40 inches. Land revenue (including H\u00e1lool), \u00a39807. The Sub-division, including H\u00e1lool, contains 4 criminal courts; police stations (th\u00fadn\u00e1s), 2; regular police, 166 men. There are no village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), but village servants called Rawanias perform both revenue and police duties.\n\nK\u00e1lol.\u2014Town in the K\u00e1lol Sub-division of Panch Mah\u00e1ls District, Bombay Presidency. K\u00e1lol is the head-quarters of the Sub-division, and lies in lat. 22\u00b0 37' N., and long. 73\u00b0 31' E. Population (1872) 3993, mostly Kunb\u00eds, a caste of cultivators; not returned separately in the Census of 1881. Of late the prosperity of K\u00e1lol has been affected by the transfer of the trade of the region from Baroda to P\u00e1li.\n\nK\u00e1lol.\u2014Sub-division of Baroda State, Bombay Presidency. Area, 288 square miles. Population (1881) 89,079, namely, 46,278 males and 42,801 females, dwelling in 85 towns and villages, the density of population being 309 persons to the square mile. Hindus numbered 84,296; Muhammadans, 2812; and Jains, 1971. The Sub-division is a fairly-wooded and well-cultivated plain. No rivers or lakes exist; the S\u00e1barmat\u00ed just touches the western boundary. The rainfall in 1879\u201380 was 30.7 inches. Land revenue (1879\u201380), including miscellaneous receipts from land, \u00a323,617. Total revenue, \u00a327,161. The number of holdings is 10,344; the average area of each holding is 9\u00be acres. The R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Railway crosses the Sub-division.\n\nK\u00e1lol.\u2014Town in K\u00e1lol Sub-division, Baroda State, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 23\u00b0 15' 35\" N., long. 72\u00b0 33' E. Population (1872) 5585; (1881) 5859, namely, 2991 males and 2868 females; travellers' bungalow; school; post-office. K\u00e1lol is a station on the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 Railway.\n\nK\u00e1lpi.\u2014Town in Jal\u00e1un District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 26\u00b0 7' 30\" N., long. 79\u00b0 47' 15\" E. Situated on the right bank of the Jumna (Jamuna), among rugged ravines, 22 miles from Or\u00e1i. Founded, according to tradition, by B\u00e1sdeo or Vasudeva, who ruled at Kamb\u00e1.\nfrom 330 to 400 A.D. In 1196 it fell to Kutab-ud-din, the viceroy of Muhammad Ghori. In 1400 the country around Kalpi and Mahoba was conferred upon Mahmud Khan. Ibrah\u00edm Shah, the Sharki prince of Jaunpur, laid siege to Kalpi several times during the early part of the 15th century. In 1435, Hoshang, King of Malwa, captured the city; but seven years later, Mahmud of Jaunpur, the successor of Ibrah\u00edm, complained to the Malwa prince that his viceroy at Kalpi neglected the laws of Isl\u00e1m, and obtained leave to chastise him. On capturing the place, however, he refused to restore it. After many intricate changes, Husain of Jaunpur was defeated in 1477, in a great battle near Kalpi; and the town with its dependencies was thenceforth absorbed in the Provinces immediately subordinate to Delhi.\n\nOn the accession of Ibrah\u00edm in 1518, Jal\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n obtained the government of Jaunpur, and, having aroused the jealousy of the Sult\u00e1n, assumed the insignia of royalty at Kalpi, and marched to attack the capital city of Agra. Being defeated, however, he fell ultimately into the hands of a Gond prince, who delivered him up to Ibrah\u00edm. After the battle of Panipat in 1526, the confederates who endeavoured to drive out the Mughals occupied Kalpi, but were defeated by B\u00e1bar at Fatehpur Sikri.\n\nDuring the Mughal period, Kalpi played so large a part in the annals of this part of India, that it would be impossible to detail its history at length. After the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s interfered in the affairs of Bundelkhand, the head-quarters of their government were fixed at Kalpi. At the time of the British occupation of Bundelkhand in 1803, N\u00e1na Gobind R\u00e1o seized upon the town. The British besieged it in December of that year, and, after a few hours' resistance, it surrendered. Kalpi was then included in the territory granted to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Himmat Bah\u00e1dur, on whose death, in 1804, it once more lapsed to Government. It was next handed over to Gobind R\u00e1o, who exchanged it two years later for villages farther to the west. Since that time, Kalpi has remained a British possession. On the 23rd of May 1858, Sir Hugh Rose (Lord Strathnairn) here defeated a large force of about 12,000 rebels, under the R\u00e1n\u00ed of Jh\u00e1nsi, R\u00e1o S\u00e1hib, and the Naw\u00e1b of B\u00e1n\u00e1da.\n\nKalpi was formerly a place of far greater importance than at the present day. It had a mint for copper coinage in the reign of Akbar; and the East India Company made it one of their principal stations for providing their commercial investment. The town, which is situated among rugged ravines, is in general meanly built, the houses being chiefly of mud, though some of a better kind are built of nodular limestone (kankar). The population, which appears to be steadily decreasing, was returned at 18,514 in 1865, at 15,570 in 1872, and at 14,306 in 1881. Classified according to religion, the population in\n1881 consisted of \u2014 Hindus, 10,502; Muhammadans, 3802; and Christians, 2. Area of town site, 852 acres. The municipal revenue, mainly derived from octroi duties, which in 1875\u201376 was returned at \u00a31606, had fallen in 1882\u201383 to \u00a3838, or by one-half; average incidence of municipal taxation, 1s. 0\u00bdd. per head. A bridge of boats on the Jh\u00e1nsi and Cawnpur road crosses the Jumna during the rainy season, from June till October, and there are besides several ferries. Good roads connect the town with Or\u00e1\u00ed, Ham\u00edrpur, B\u00e1nda, Jalaun, and Jh\u00e1nsi.\n\nThe western outskirt of the town, along the river-side, contains a large number of ruins, notably the tomb called the Eighty-four Domes, and twelve other handsome mausoleums. At one time the town adjoined these ruins, but it has gradually shifted south-eastward. Ganeshganj and Ternanganj, two modern quarters in that direction, at present conduct all the traffic. The buildings of the old commercial agency crown some higher ground, but are now for the most part empty. A ruined fort, situated on the steep bank of the Jumna, overhangs the gh\u00e1t. The principal business carried on is the export of cotton, grain, etc., to Cawnpur, M\u00edrzapur, and Calcutta, and the town, although decreasing in population, is still a great emporium of trade of the western states of Bundelkhand, via the S\u00e1g\u00e1r road, and also of a river traffic up and down the Jumna. K\u00e1lpi has also sugar-candy and paper manufactures, which have a reputation throughout all Upper India. The town is the head-quarters of an extra-Assistant Commissioner, and contains, besides the usual sub-divisional courts, a police station, dispensary, and good school.\n\nK\u00e1lpi.\u2014Village, with large b\u00e1z\u00e1r and market-place, on the right bank of the H\u00fagl\u00ed, in the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal; 48 miles below Calcutta. Lat. 22\u00b0 4' N., long. 88\u00b0 18' E. The river at this point forms an anchorage for vessels proceeding up or down.\n\nKalr\u00e1yan.\u2014Mountain range in Salem District, Madras Presidency; lying between 11\u00b0 38' and 11\u00b0 52' N. lat., and between 78\u00b0 31' 30\" and 78\u00b0 46' E. long.; averaging from 3000 to 4000 feet above sea-level. Inhabited almost exclusively by Malay\u00e1l\u00eds, who occupy about 66 hamlets. Total population (1872) 5992; (1881) 6038. The principal part of the group is in the middle of At\u00far t\u00e1luk. This portion is divided into the Periya and Chinna (big and little) Kalr\u00e1yan; the latter is held on favourable tenures by petty chiefs, who have nearly denuded it of its forests. The forests on Periya Kalr\u00e1yan are now under Government care. The Malay\u00e1l\u00eds pay tax, not on the land, but on their ploughs and billhooks. Their great temple to Kari R\u00e1man is on the Periya Kalr\u00e1yan.\n\nK\u00e1lsi.\u2014Northern tahsil of Dehra D\u00fan District, North-Western Provinces, consisting of the rugged mountain region of Jaunsar Bawar.\nArea, 478 square miles, of which only 29 are cultivated. The population of the tahsil was returned at 40,046 in 1872, and at 45,117 in 1881, namely, males 25,400, and females 19,717. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 44,184; Muhammadans, 726; Jains, 19; and \u2018others,\u2019 188. Land revenue (1882), \u00a32621; total Government revenue, including local rates and cesses, \u00a33017. In 1882\u201383, the tahsil contained 2 civil and 2 criminal courts, with 2 police stations; strength of police force, 48 men.\n\nK\u00e1lsi.\u2014Town in Dehra D\u00fan District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of K\u00e1lsi tahsil. Lat. 30\u00b0 32' 20\" N., long. 77\u00b0 53' 25\" E.; situated close to the junction of the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1) with the Tons. Probably a place of great antiquity, but containing in 1881 a population of only 854 persons. Tahsil school and charitable dispensary. The famous K\u00e1lsi stone, found near this place, bears an inscription of Asoka, the Buddhist emperor of Upper India (250 B.C.).\n\nKalsi\u00e1.\u2014One of the Cis-Sutlej States, under the Government of the Punjab, lying between 30\u00b0 17' and 30\u00b0 25' N. lat., and between 77\u00b0 21' and 77\u00b0 35' E. long. The founder of the family was Sard\u00e1r Gur Bakhsh Singh, who came from the village of Kalsi\u00e1 in the Punjab proper. His son, Jodh Singh, a man of ability and prowess, effected considerable conquests in the neighbourhood of Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 towards the close of the last century. When the Cis-Sutlej States came under British protection, Sard\u00e1r Jodh Singh, after some hesitation, followed the general example. The present Sard\u00e1r of Kalsi\u00e1 is Bishen Singh, a Sikh by religion, of a Punjab J\u00e1t family. The area of the State is 178 square miles; estimated revenue, \u00a315,600. Population in 1881, 67,708, namely, Hindus, 41,636; Muhammadans, 19,930; Sikhs, 5923; Jains, 218; Christian, 1. Number of villages and towns, 179; number of houses, 11,933, of which 9311 were occupied, and 2622 unoccupied. Average density of population, 380 per square mile. Principal products\u2014wheat, cotton, Indian corn, sugar, and saffron. The chief receives \u00a3285 per annum in perpetuity from the British Government, as compensation for the abolition of custom duties. The military force consists of 50 cavalry, 260 infantry, 3 guns, and 8 artillerymen.\n\nKalsub\u00e1i.\u2014Hill in N\u00e1sik District, Bombay Presidency; 5427 feet high, and the most elevated point in the Deccan. Its summit is crowned by a temple, ten miles south-east of Ig\u00e1tpuri, a station on the north-east line of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. A priest of Devi Kalsu daily climbs to the temple from Indor, a village at the foot of the hill, to offer a sacrifice of fowls.\n\nKalu.\u2014River in the G\u00e1ro Hills District, Assam, which rises near the station of Tur\u00e1, in lat. 25\u00b0 29' N., and long. 90\u00b0 22' E., and flowing west into Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, finally empties itself into the Brahmaputra. Its chief tributary is the Baran\u00e1si or Rangkan. During the rainy season\nit is navigable by boats of 2 tons burthen from H\u00e1rig\u00e1on, on the frontier of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra District, up to D\u00e1m\u00e1lg\u00edr\u00ed, which is within 12 miles of Tur\u00e1.\n\n**Kalumbe** (or Kal\u00famar).\u2014The highest peak in the Bh\u00e1nrer range, near Katangi, in Jabalpur District, Central Provinces; 2544 feet about sea-level. Lat. 23\u00b0 28' N., long. 79\u00b0 47' E.\n\n**Kalw\u00e1n.**\u2014Sub-division of N\u00e1sik District, Bombay Presidency, situated in the north-west of the District. Area, 554 square miles. Population (1881) 58,486, namely, 29,930 males and 28,556 females, dwelling in 187 villages, and occupying 8847 houses. Hindus numbered 43,474; Muhammadans, 735; 'others' unspecified, 14,277. Great part of the population (29,207) belong to the cultivating caste of Kunbis. The west is covered with steep bare hills; towards the east the country, though flatter and more fertile, is divided by a spur running south-east from the Sahyadris; in the south rises the high and rugged Sapt\u00e1shring range, with its lower slopes fringed with teak. In 1880\u201381, there were 4941 holdings, averaging 24 acres in extent, and paying an average rent of \u00a31, 16s. 4d. In the same year there were 101,336 acres under tillage, of which 66,496 acres were in grain crops (b\u00e1jra, jo\u00e1r, rice, and other cereals). This Sub-division, which was only separated from Kh\u00e1ndesh District in 1874, contains 2 criminal courts; police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 1; regular police, 56 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 184. Land revenue, \u00a36374.\n\n**Kalw\u00e1n.**\u2014Town and head-quarters of Kalw\u00e1n Sub-division of N\u00e1sik District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 20\u00b0 30' 40\" N., long. 74\u00b0 3' E. Situated in the Girna valley, 35 miles west of M\u00e1legaon. Population (1881) 2022. The climate is unhealthy. Revenue, police, and post offices. The centre of large sugar-cane gardens.\n\n**Kaly\u00e1n.**\u2014Sub-division of Th\u00e1na District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 278 square miles. Population (1872) 72,556; (1881) 77,988, namely, 49,547 males and 37,441 females; density of population, 280 persons per square mile. The Sub-division is bounded on the north by the Ulh\u00e1s and Bh\u00e1tsa rivers; on the east by Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur and Murbad; on the south by Karjat and Panwel; and on the west by the Persik range. Of the total area, 10\u00b72 square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. Of the rest, 58\u00b78 per cent., or 100,716 acres, are arable; 7 per cent. forest, and 18 per cent. village sites, roads, ponds, and river beds. The population occupies 1 town and 222 villages, dwelling in 13,924 houses. As regards religious divisions, there are 72,248 Hindus; 5283 Muhammadans; 292 P\u00e1rsis; 143 Christians; and 22 Jews. In 1879\u201380, there were 9322 holdings, the average area of a holding being 10\u00bd acres, and the average rent paid by the r\u00e1yat, \u00a31, 10s. In 1880\u201381 there were 42,108 acres under tillage, 89 per cent. of which were in grain, mostly rice. Oil-seeds, pulses, and\na small quantity of fibres occupied the remaining area. The returns of agricultural stock show 31,768 horned cattle, 43 horses, 50 asses, 2043 sheep and goats, 8775 ploughs, and 2333 carts.\n\nThe Sub-division is triangular in form, and in its western part a rich open plain. In the south and east, ranges of hills running parallel with the boundary line throw out spurs into the heart of the Sub-division. The transport of produce is facilitated by the tidal creek of the Uhl\u00e1s river and by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, which intersects the Sub-division. The river Kalu is navigable by boats of ten tons for nine miles above Kaly\u00e1n. There are disagreeable east winds in April and May; but although fever is prevalent in the cold season, the climate is on the whole temperate and healthy. Average rainfall, 86 inches. The Sub-division contains 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; police stations (ih\u00e1n\u00e1s), 1; regular police, 40 men. Land revenue (1882\u201383), \u00a313,882.\n\nKaly\u00e1n.\u2014Chief town, port, and municipality of Kaly\u00e1n Sub-division in Th\u00e1na District, Bombay Presidency; situate at the junction of the north-east and south-east lines of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 33 miles north-east of Bombay. Lat. 19\u00b0 14' N., long. 73\u00b0 10' E. Population (1872) 12,804; (1881) 12,910, namely, 6976 males and 5934 females. Hindus numbered 9949; Muhammadans, 2559; Jains, 10; Christians, 15; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 258; and \u2018others,\u2019 19. Municipal income (1882\u201383), \u00a31331; municipal expenditure, \u00a31245; incidence of taxation, 2s. 4d. Average annual value of sea-borne trade during the five years ending 1873\u201374\u2014imports, \u00a3163,171; exports, \u00a3151,181; total, \u00a3314,352. In 1881\u201382, the imports were valued at \u00a3101,482, and the exports \u00a3142,999. The railway returns show a rise in number of passengers from 294,569 in 1870 to 394,975 in 1880, and a fall in goods from 37,485 tons in 1870 to 22,177 tons in 1880. The fall in the goods traffic is due to the fact that salt is now sent from Bh\u00e1yndar on the Baroda Railway direct to up-country stations. Kaly\u00e1n has a large rice-husking trade carried on by about 200 Muhammadans, a few P\u00e1rs\u00eds, and some Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. This industry gives occupation to 2000 persons, half of whom are women. There is also a trade in salt, tobacco, and myrobalans. The six miles of streets and lanes in the town are metalled, and kept in clean condition. A ferry plies across the Ulh\u00e1s to Kone on the opposite bank. The town is the head-quarters of the Sub-division; it contains 2400 houses; has a vegetable market built by the municipality; and is supplied with water from 353 wells and 8 small reservoirs. Under Muhammadan rule the town was 70 acres in extent, had eleven towers and four gates, and was surrounded by a wall. During the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 war of 1780\u201382 Kaly\u00e1n withstood a severe siege. Sub-judge\u2019s court, post-office, and dispensary.\nThe name of Kaly\u00e1n appears in ancient inscriptions, which have been attributed to the first, second, fifth, or sixth centuries A.D. According to the Periplus, Kaly\u00e1n rose to importance about the end of the second century. Kosmos Indikopleustes, in the sixth century, mentions it as one of the five chief marts of Western India, the seat of a powerful king, with a trade in brass, blackwood logs, and articles of clothing. Early in the fourteenth century, the Muhammadans found Kaly\u00e1n the capital of a District, and gave it the name of Isl\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1d. It was taken by the Portuguese in 1536. They did not garrison the town; but, returning in 1570, burnt the suburbs and carried off much booty. From this time it seems to have formed part of the Ahmadnagar kingdom; in 1636 it was transferred to Bij\u00e1pur. In 1648, Sivaji's general, Ab\u00e1ji Somadev, surprised Kaly\u00e1n and took the governor prisoner. The Muhammadans recovered the town in 1660, but again lost it in 1662. In 1674, Sivaji granted the English leave to establish a factory. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in 1780 having cut off their supplies, Kaly\u00e1n was seized by the British, and has since remained in their possession.\n\nKaly\u00e1nmal.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Hardoi District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d pargan\u00e1 in S\u00edt\u00e1pur, from which it is separated by the G\u00famt\u00ed river, on the east by Gundw\u00e1 pargan\u00e1, and on the south and west by Sandil\u00e1 pargan\u00e1. The ancient name of the place was Rathaulia, and it is said to be one of the Br\u00e1hmanical places of pilgrimage described in the Ram\u00e1yan\u00e1. Tradition traces the name of Rathaulia from R\u00e1ma's having halted his chariot (rath) here, on his return from Ceylon, in order to wash away his sin of slaying R\u00e1vana in the sacred pool of Hattia Haran. Up to five hundred years ago it was held by the Thatheras, who were driven out by a Baisw\u00e1r\u00e1 chief, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Kum\u00e1r, who ruled over 94 villages from his fort at Rathauli, the ruins of which still exist. His n\u00e1ib or deputy was a Sakarw\u00e1r Kshattriya, named N\u00e1g Mal, who succeeded to the estate\u2014according to some, after murdering his master, but according to others, by peaceable means. Two of his grandsons, Kaly\u00e1n S\u00e1h and Gog S\u00e1h, inherited 52 villages, while a third succeeded to the remaining 42. The present pargan\u00e1 consists of the possessions of Kaly\u00e1n S\u00e1h and Gog S\u00e1h, together with other villages in the south, which their descendants obtained possession of by driving out the Jul\u00e1has. Nearly the whole area (63 out of 72 villages) is still owned by Sakarw\u00e1r Kshattriyas.\n\nThe tract possesses no marked natural features. Like all the country along the G\u00famt\u00ed, its poorest side borders the river, the land gradually improving towards the central level, and falling off again as the next river is approached. Area, 63 square miles, of which 41 are cultivated. Government land revenue at time of settlement,\n\u00a34616; average incidence, 3s. 6\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area, or 2s. 3d. per acre of total area. The staple products are wheat and barley, which occupy two-fifths of the cultivated area; gram and arhar occupy another fifth, while the remainder consists of commoner grains and oil-seeds. The prevailing tenure is that known as imperfect pattid\u00e1ri, which prevails in 37 villages; 29 are zamind\u00e1ri, and only 6 t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri. Population in 1869, 24,875; and in 1881, 28,572, namely, males 15,098; and females 13,474. The most numerous castes are Cham\u00e1rs, Br\u00e1hmans, and P\u00e1s\u00eds. The Kshattriyas, who are the land-holding community, form only a very small proportion of the general population. Roads consist merely of rough cart-tracks. A fair, attended by about 14,000 persons, is held in the month of Bhadra at the sacred Hattia Haran tank, near Kaly\u00e1nmal village. A numerously attended fair is also held at Kaly\u00e1nmal village, in the month of Agrah\u00e1yan.\n\nK\u00e1ma (K\u00e1m\u00e1n).\u2014Town in Bhar\u0163pur (Bhurtpore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1n\u00e1. \u2014See KAMAN.\n\nK\u00e1ma.\u2014Township in Thayet-myo District, Irawadi Division, British Burma. Lat. 18\u00b0 49\u2032 to 19\u00b0 5\u2032 N., long. 94\u00b0 45\u2032 to 95\u00b0 14\u2032 20\u2033 E. Bounded on the north by Thayet and Meng-d\u00fan townships; on the east by the Irawadi; on the south by Padaung township in Prome District; and on the west by the Arakan Vomas. Area, 575 square miles. Population (1876) 30,363; (1881) 35,383; gross revenue, \u00a37489. K\u00e1ma includes Mya-wadi, the emerald country, so called from the expiatory offerings of a royal parricide. This division was formerly the charge of a Myo-th\u00fagy\u00ed. At the time when the Register was prepared (1783 A.D.), the Myo-th\u00fagyiship of K\u00e1ma is said to have contained 142 villages, which were divided into 5 circles and 59 village Th\u00fagyiships. The Myo-thugy\u00ed had not, as most others of the class had, any powers of life and death, nor possessed the privilege of carrying a gold umbrella. Mya-wadi, under Burmese rule, does not appear to have been divided into revenue circles. The annual tribute exacted by the Burmese court from K\u00e1ma was \u00a3857, and from Mya-wadi, \u00a3428. The population dwells in 183 villages, which again are distributed over 13 revenue circles. In 1882 the land revenue was \u00a33528; capitation-tax, \u00a33560; fisheries, \u00a323; taxes on nets, \u00a321; local cesses, \u00a3357. Area under cultivation (1881\u201382), 25,375 acres; of which 19,301 acres were under rice, and 1786 under tobacco. Agricultural stock (1881\u201382), 7929 buffaloes; 15,215 bullocks, bulls, and cows; 1657 pigs; 29 goats; 3912 carts; 6371 sledges; and 212 boats.\n\nK\u00e1ma.\u2014Head-quarters of K\u00e1ma township, Thayet-myo District, Irawadi Division, British Burma. Situated in lat. 19\u00b0 1\u2032 N., and long. 95\u00b0 10\u2032 E., on the right bank of the Irawadi, on picturesque hills, crowned by pagodas or monasteries. Population (1872) 2943; (1881) 1796;\nnumber of houses, 294, one of them a police station. The Ma-de stream flows through the town; and the Ma-t\u00fan enters the Irawadi a short distance above the town. All the surplus produce of the valley of the Ma-t\u00fan, consisting of tobacco, chillies, onions, cutch, and cotton, is sold at K\u00e1ma. Several legends are current as to the origin of the name. According to one of these, it was a prosperous town in the days of Rek-kan, King of Prome in 250 B.C., who called it Ma-h\u00e1-ga-ma, i.e. ma-h\u00e1 \u2018great,\u2019 and ga-ma \u2018a second-class city,\u2019 viz. one with a market but without walls. The great Burmese king Alompra rechristened it K\u00e1ma, i.e. \u2018love\u2019 or \u2018desire.\u2019 It has been suggested that if the town was really called Mah\u00e1g\u00e1ma, it was called after the Mah\u00e1-gama of Ceylon, and the Maagrama of Ptolemy.\n\n**Kamadhia.**\u2014Petty State of South K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village.

The ferry at this village is much used. The river was twice crossed here by a British force in 1805, in pursuit of the retreating Amir Kh\u00e1n, on the occasion of his invasion of Rohilkhand. The village was swept away by floods in 1873, and no trace now remains of its former site.\n\nKam\u00e1sin (or Darsenda).\u2014Tahsil of B\u00e1nda District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the south bank of the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1), and sloping up towards the Vindhyan range.

The city was founded by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Niladw\u00e1j, the first king who succeeded the Pal dynasty in the government of K\u00e1mrup. Its ruins indicate that it must have been a very extensive place. Dr. Buchanan-Hamilton, in 1809, found that it occupied an area 19 miles in circumference, 5 of which were defended by the Dharl\u00e1, and the rest by a rampart and ditch. The city consisted of several enclosures, one within the other, the centre one being occupied by the king\u2019s palace. Kam\u00e1t\u00e1pur was abandoned and fell into decay after the overthrow of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Nilambhar, the second successor of its founder, by Husain Sh\u00e1h, Afgh\u00e1n King of Bengal, 1497\u20131521 A.D. Kam\u00e1t\u00e1pur figures conspicuously as Comati in some of the earlier maps of India.\n\nKambam (Kambham).\u2014Town in Mad\u00fara District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Cumbum.\nKambam (Kambham).\u2014Town in Karn\u00fal (Kurnool) District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Cumbum.\n\nKambar (Sh\u00e1hdatpur).\u2014T\u00e1luk in Upper Sind Frontier District, Sind, Bombay Presidency, recently transferred from Shik\u00e1rpur District; situated between $27^\\circ 28'$ and $27^\\circ 59' 30''$ N. lat., and between $67^\\circ 33' 45''$ and $68^\\circ 10'$ E. long.

Lat. $27^\\circ 35'$ N., and long. $68^\\circ 2' 45''$ E.; distant about 12 miles by road west by north from L\u00e1rk\u00e1na, chief town of the Subdivision and a station on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway. There is also road communication with Ghaibi Dero, Sij\u00e1wal, Rato Dero, Nas\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d, Dost Al\u00ed, and Sh\u00e1hd\u00e1dpur. It is the head-quarters station of a mukhtyark\u00e1r and a tap\u00e1d\u00e1r, and, in addition to their offices, possesses a Government school, municipal hall, dispensary, mus\u00e1f\u00edr-kh\u00e1ma, branch post-office, and police lines for 29 men. Population (1872) 3518; (1881) 6133, namely, 3305 males and 2828 females. Hindus numbered 529; Muhammadans, 4275; and \u2018others,\u2019 1329. The Kambar municipality, established in 1862, had an income in 1882\u201383 of \u00a3640, derived mostly from town dues, cattle-pound fees, and fisheries. Municipal expenditure, \u00a3782; incidence of municipal taxation, 1s. 4d. The town was plundered by the Bal\u00fach\u00eds in 1844, and almost destroyed by fire in the following year.\n\nKaml\u00e1.\u2014River of Northern Behar, rising in Nep\u00e1l under the first range of the Sub-Him\u00e1layas; it enters British territory near Jainagar in Darbhanga District, whence it flows in a south-easterly direction towards Kamtaul, near which it recently cut a new channel for itself into the Little B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed. Its old bed runs southwards till it joins the Tiljug\u00e1, near the point where that river receives the Kar\u00e1i. Above Kamtaul, the Kaml\u00e1 is sometimes navigable by boats of 10 tons burthen. The lower part, known as the Old Kaml\u00e1, is generally dry in the cold and hot weather (as its main current is drained off into the Little B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed); but in the rains it contains a good volume of water, and is navigable by boats of about 4 tons burthen. The numerous bifurcations and interlacings of the Kaml\u00e1 defy description. The\nriver ranks third in the District in point of size, causes the greatest floods, and is highly reverenced as a sacred stream by the Hindus.\n\n**Kaml\u00e1garh.**\u2014Fortress in Mandi State, Punjab; situated in lat. 31\u00b0 48' N., and long. 76\u00b0 43' E., near the south bank of the Bi\u00e1s (Beas); consisting of a range of forts, about 3 miles in length, constructed partly of masonry and partly of the natural sandstone rock. The principal stronghold crowns an isolated peak, whose precipitous sides tower 1500 feet above the Beas, with double that elevation above sea-level. Sans\u00e1r Chand, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of K\u00e1ngra, attacked the fortifications unsuccessfully; but General Ventura, the partisan Sikh commander, succeeded in carrying them in November 1840 against the popular belief in their impregnability.\n\n**Kamon\u00e1.**\u2014Village in Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 28\u00b0 8' N., long. 78\u00b0 10' E. (Thornton); lies near the right bank of the East K\u00e1li Nad\u00ed, 64 miles south-east of Delhi. Population (1881) 1124. At the time of the British annexation, the Kamon\u00e1 fort was held by Dunde Kh\u00e1n of the L\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n\u00ed family, members of which are still the largest landed proprietors in the District. He rebelled in 1805, but although pardoned, again revolted with his son in 1807. His fort was invested and stormed, but was only carried after great slaughter. His estates were confiscated and given to a near relative, Mard\u00e1n \u00c1lf Kh\u00e1n, the father of the present Naw\u00e1b of Chat\u00e1ri, and grandfather of Sir Faiz \u00c1l\u00ed Kh\u00e1n of Pah\u00e1su.\n\n**Kampil.**\u2014Village in Kaimganj tahs\u00edl, Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces; situated on the old cliff of the Ganges, 28 miles north-west of Fatehgarh town. A K\u00e1yasth village, with a population in 1881 of 2531, namely, males 1285, and females 1246. A large number of Br\u00e1hmans also live in the village. Kampil is celebrated in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1r\u00e1ta as being the capital of Southern Panch\u00e1la, and of King Draupada. Here his daughter, Draupad\u00ed, married the five Pandava brethren. The villagers still show the mound where the R\u00e1ja\u2019s castle stood, and point with pride to a small hollow called the pool or kund of Draupad\u00ed. They aver that the ancient city was founded by a hermit named Kamp\u00edla Rikh, and that before the days of Draupada it was ruled by a king named Brahmadatta. At the end of the thirteenth century, Kampil appears as a nest of highway robbers, against whom the Emperor Ghiyas-ud-d\u00edn Balban marched a force in person, and built here a fort in which he established an Afgh\u00e1n garrison. The town or its vicinity was subjected to a visitation by Muhammad Tughlak, and again in 1418 an expedition was despatched against the troublesome Rahtors of the neighbourhood. By 1452, the town had fallen into the possession of the Chauh\u00e1ns. After the establishment of the Mughal Empire, Kampil appears no more in history, save its\nmention in Akbar's revenue survey as the chief town of a *pargan\u00e1*, and such it has remained ever since. The modern village, situated at the junction of several unmetalled roads, contains a police station, post-office, and an elementary village school. Two yearly fairs are held here, in October\u2013November and March\u2013April. For police and conservancy purposes, a small income tax is raised.\n\n**Kampli.**\u2014Town in Hospet *t\u00e1luk* of Bellary District, Madras Presidency. Lat. $15\u00b0\\ 24' \\ 40''$ N., long. $76\u00b0\\ 38' \\ 40''$ E. Population (1871) 9610; (1881) 9828, namely, 4985 males and 4843 females, occupying 2488 houses. Area of town site, 5325 acres. In 1881, Hindus numbered 7907; Muhammadans, 1912; Christians, 8; and 'others,' 1. The town is built on the bank of the Tungabhadra, close to one of the fords where the river may be crossed, and also near an important anicut or weir for irrigation. The site is low, and it is surrounded by rice fields. Weaving, especially of silk cloth, is carried on. Sub-magistrate's court.\n\n**Kamptee.**\u2014Large town and cantonment in N\u00e1gpur District, Central Provinces.\u2014See KAMTHI.\n\n**K\u00e1mr\u00fap.**\u2014District of Assam, occupying the central portion of the Brahmaputra valley. It lies between $25\u00b0\\ 44'$ and $26\u00b0\\ 53'$ N. lat., and between $90\u00b0\\ 40'$ and $92\u00b0\\ 12'$ E. long., extending along both banks of the Brahmaputra. K\u00e1mr\u00fap is bounded by Bh\u00fat\u00e1n on the north; by Darrang and Nowgong (Nauga\u00f3n) Districts on the east; by the Kh\u00e1si Hills on the south; and by Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District on the west. Area, 3857'6 square miles. Population (according to the Census of 1881) 644,960 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of Gauhati, on the left or south bank of the Brahmaputra.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The general characteristics of K\u00e1mr\u00fap are those common to the whole valley of Assam. In the immediate neighbourhood of the Brahmaputra, the land is low, and exposed to annual inundation. In this marshy tract, reeds and canes flourish luxuriantly, and rice and mustard are extensively cultivated. At a comparatively short distance from the river banks, the ground begins to rise in undulating knolls towards the mountains of Bh\u00fat\u00e1n on the north, and towards the Kh\u00e1si territory on the south. The hills south of the Brahmaputra in some parts reach the height of from 2000 to 3000 feet. It is on the slopes of these hills, amid the primeval jungle, that European planters have set out their trim tea-gardens. The general scenery of K\u00e1mr\u00fap is thus agreeably diversified; and the villages are described as very picturesque in their position and structure.\n\nThe great river of K\u00e1mr\u00fap is the Brahmaputra, which is navigable by steamers all the year through. It divides the District into two nearly equal portions, and receives numerous tributaries both on the north and south banks, which are themselves navigable for native boats.\nduring the rainy season. The most important of these are the Man\u00e1s, Ch\u00e1ul-Khoy\u00e1, and Barnad\u00ed on the north; and the Kuls\u00ed on the south. The Brahmaputra exhibits the phenomena of alluvion and diluvion on a grand scale. Extensive sandbanks or islands are annually formed in some part of its wide channel, on which rank vegetation immediately springs up; but these new creations are often swept away by the floods of the following year, and their materials re-deposited lower down. Many of the minor streams which take their rise in the hills beyond the northern boundary of the District, have the peculiarity that in the dry season, near the point where they debouch upon the plains, they suddenly disappear, the water sinking into the ground. The bed, however, is found full of water again a short distance lower down, and thence flows steadily all the year. With the exception of the Brahmaputra, all the rivers are fordable at one place or other during the dry season. Swamps and marshes are thickly dotted over the low lands of the District, many of which contain water through the dry season. There are no canals or artificial watercourses, but there are a few minor embankments for the protection of the crops.\n\nForests cover a considerable portion of the District area, estimated at about 130 square miles. The Forest Department has reserved seven tracts, all in the south of the District, in the neighbourhood of the Kuls\u00ed river, with an aggregate area of 49 square miles; and the indiscriminate cutting of timber has been placed under restrictions. The most important of these revenue-yielding forests are\u2014(1) Bardw\u00e1r, (2) Dimruy\u00e1, (3) Pant\u00e1n, (4) Mayr\u00e1pur, and (5) Bar\u00e1mbai. The forest trees are principally s\u00e1l, t\u00fan, teak, and nahor. There is also a Plantation Reserve, where seedlings of teak, s\u00e1l, sissu, s\u00fam, and nahor are reared, and experiments are being made with the caoutchouc tree. The total expenditure of the Forest Department in 1881-82 was \u00a32593; the income, \u00a32789.\n\nThe wild vegetable productions of K\u00e1mrup consist of the timber trees above mentioned, bamboos, firewood, reeds, canes, etc. The hill tribes of L\u00e1lungs, Cachar\u00eds, Garos, M\u00edkirs, and Kh\u00e1s\u00eds, etc., gain a subsistence by collecting and trading in jungle products, such as lac, beeswax, fibres, dyes, gums, etc., which are found in abundance. Large pasture-grounds exist, and the Bhuti\u00e1s drive down their herds of cattle to graze along the foot of the Bhut\u00e1n Hills. Herdsmen from Bengal also bring immense numbers of cattle to graze in the District.\n\nFauna.\u2014Elephants, tigers, leopards, bears, rhinoceros, buffaloes, large deer, and wild hog are common throughout K\u00e1mrup, especially in the north of the District, which swarms with animal life of all kinds. Wild elephants frequently do great damage to the crops; and in the winter of 1866-67, one village was abandoned in consequence of the destruction caused by them. The Cachar\u00ed villages\nare usually surrounded by a stout fence to keep out wild beasts. During 1868, 129 persons were reported to have lost their lives from wild beasts, or in consequence of snake-bites. By 1882-83, the number of registered deaths from these causes had decreased to 36. The smaller varieties of game consist of hares, peacocks, wild-fowl, herons, wild geese, wild ducks of various sorts, partridges, floricans, and snipe. Among fishes, the principal varieties are the *roi* or *ruh\u00ed*, the *pithi\u00e1*, and the *chitil*.\n\n**History.** \u2014 K\u00e1mrup preserves the name of the legendary Hindu kingdom spoken of in the *Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata*. This kingdom is said to have extended, not only over the whole of the Assam valley, but from the mountains of Manipur in the east to the Kar\u00e1ttoy\u00e1 river in the west. It thus included the greater portion of the Bengal District of Rangpur. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Bhagadatta, the son of Narak, whose capital was at the city of Pray\u00e1ga-jyostishpur (identified with the modern Gauh\u00e1ti), is described in the *Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata* as espousing the cause of Dharjyudan, and being slain by the victorious Arjuna. According to the authority of the *A\u00edn-i-Akbar\u00ed*, Bhagadatta had twenty-three successors in his dynasty; and the *Yogini Tantr\u00e1* gives a confused account of some of these monarchs. Apart from these traditions, which are the common property of Hinduism, and cannot be localized in K\u00e1mrup, there is abundant archaeological evidence to prove, that before the advent of the Ahoms from the eastern mountains, Assam had been incorporated into the civilisation of India Proper. But beyond that bare fact, nothing can be predicated with certainty concerning the early Hindu inhabitants of the Brahmaputra valley. It is worthy of notice in this connection that the present District of K\u00e1mrup contains several revered sites of Hindu pilgrimage; and that the Mah\u00e1muni temple, one of these sites, is annually visited by Buddhists from beyond the Him\u00e1layas, who regard it as sanctified by the presence of the founder of their faith.\n\nLocal tradition asserts that this tract was once ruled over by the Bara Bhuiy\u00e1s, whose name would seem to indicate that they were chiefs of independent tribes. The dawn of authentic history shows us the Koch tribe, under their leader H\u00e1jo, pushing their conquests westwards from Assam into Kuch Behar Proper. The connection of K\u00e1mrup with the advancing Muhammadan power dates from circ. 1204 A.D., when the R\u00e1j\u00e1, after making offers of friendship to Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khilj\u00ed, who did not respond, defeated the Musalm\u00e1n forces. Bakhtiyar\u2019s army escaped with great difficulty. \u2018The armour of the K\u00e1mrup people,\u2019 says a native historian, \u2018was entirely composed of bamboo tied together with silk.\u2019 Another Muhammadan writer relates of Ghiy\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn, circ. 1225, that he extended his arms from Jagann\u00e1th in Orissa to K\u00e1mrup. Ikhtiy\u00e1r-ud-d\u00edn M\u00e1lik\nUsbeg again invaded the territories of K\u00e1mr\u00fap in 1256-57, seized the capital, drove the R\u00e1j\u00e1 back into the mountains, raised a mosque, and was proclaimed 'sovereign of the united kingdoms of Bengal and K\u00e1mr\u00fap.' In the rainy season, however, the Hindus poured down from the mountains, cut the banks of the rivers, flooded the whole country, defeated and mortally wounded Ikhtiy\u00e1r-ud-d\u00edn M\u00e1lik Usbeg, and took his whole army prisoners (1257). In 1489, Sult\u00e1n Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Husain Sh\u00e1h successfully invaded K\u00e1mr\u00fap, plundered the country, and appointed his son Governor of the conquered Districts. Nar N\u00e1r\u00e1yan, the native king of the Kuch Behar dynasty, is known to have restored the two ruined temples of the goddess K\u00e1m\u00e1khy\u00e1 and of Mah\u00e1muni, which are at the present day crowded by pilgrims from Bengal.\n\nThe date of the restoration is placed at 1550. His successors were feeble princes, who divided their extensive empire, and fell an easy prey to the conquering Mughals. This was the period when the Muhammadans advanced farthest up the Assam valley. After annexing Rangpur and Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 to the Province of Bengal, they established themselves for a short time in what is now K\u00e1mr\u00fap District, where the faith of Isl\u00e1m still has followers. But in 1663, M\u00edr Juml\u00e1, the well-known general of Aurangzeb, was severely defeated by the Ahams, a race of Shan origin, who had entered the upper valley of the Brahmaputra four centuries earlier. The Ahams forthwith fortified their new conquests, by restoring the ruined earthworks of Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed, whose original builders are unknown. Twice, and especially in 1682, the Mughals made endeavours to recover possession of the town; but on each occasion they were defeated with loss, and finally they were content to leave the Ahams in undisturbed possession of all Assam. The memory of these defeats long remained fresh in the minds of the Musalm\u00e1ns. The later Naw\u00e1bs of Bengal carefully encouraged the growth of the dense grass jungle, which naturally overgrows the banks of the Brahmaputra, in order to serve as the best defence against their Aham enemy.\n\nThe fort of R\u00e1ng\u00e1m\u00e1t\u00ed, now in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, remained the extreme north-eastern outpost of the Delhi Empire. Meanwhile, the wild Ahams were beginning to fall under the enervating influences of Hinduism. Their national religion which they brought with them from their home in the remote Shan Hills, consisted of a form of demon-worship by the propitiation of evil spirits. Their old religious books are still extant, and are to be found in the hands of their priests (deodhains). The Ahams displayed, to an eminent degree, the faculty of adapting themselves to the manners and beliefs of their subjects; and while their dynasty endured, it was based upon very firm foundations. Chakradw\u00e1j is the name of the first R\u00e1j\u00e1 who submitted himself to the Br\u00e1hmans.\nThe British connection with Assam dates from 1792, in which year a dispossessed R\u00e1j\u00e1 besought to be restored to the throne by our assistance. A British force was accordingly sent, and replaced the R\u00e1j\u00e1 on the throne, but was recalled in 1794. Internal anarchy, caused by disputed successions, prevailed for many years, until in 1808 the R\u00e1j\u00e1 in possession called in the Burmese to support his claims. The Burmese came as masters rather than as servants. They set up a puppet of their own, called Jogeswar, in whose name they governed Assam as a Province of the Burmese Empire. In those days it was the British policy to exhibit indifference with regard to changes of administration that took place beyond the frontier of India; and Assam had never been recognised as an integral part of the peninsula. But in 1824, the Burmese, in assertion of their claims to universal empire, wantonly invaded the then Native State of Cachar. As an incident in the Burmese war that ensued, Assam was occupied by a British army. After being defeated in one considerable engagement, the Burmese retreated precipitately before the advance of the British troops; and in granting peace to them, we resolved to deliver the native Assamese from their oppressive yoke. The lower Assam valley was annexed to Bengal, Upper Assam being constituted a separate State under R\u00e1j\u00e1 Purandar Singh. His administration proved so bad, that in 1838 it was necessary to annex the entire territory. Assam was separated from Bengal in 1874, and erected into an independent administration under a Chief Commissioner.\n\nPeople.\u2014An enumeration taken about the year 1840 returned the population of K\u00e1mru\u00fap at 271,944 persons; a second enumeration, in 1848, raised this total to 387,775. It does not appear that either of these figures are better than mere estimates. A regular Census was conducted in 1871 by actual counting, through the agency of the mauz\u00e1dd\u00e1rs or village revenue officials. The enumeration was not effected simultaneously in a single night, as was the case in Bengal, but was protracted through the greater part of the month of November. The results, which are believed to be fairly accurate, disclosed a total population of 561,681 persons, residing in 103,908 houses and in 1649 mauz\u00e1s or unions of villages. The Census Report of 1881 returned the population at 644,960, showing an increase of 83,279, or 14\u00b783 per cent., over the previous enumeration in 1871. Area of the District as returned in 1881, 3631 square miles, containing 2562 towns and villages, and 94,172 houses. Persons per square mile, 177\u00b76; villages per square mile, '70; houses per square mile, 26. The average number of persons per village is 252; of persons per house, 6\u00b78. Classified according to sex, there are 329,061 males and 315,899 females; proportion of males, 51\u00b70 per cent. Classified according to age, there are, under 15 years, 142,662 boys and 133,279\ngirls; total children, 275,941, or 44.3 per cent. of the total population: 15 years and upwards, males 186,399, and females 182,620; total adults, 369,019, or 55.7 per cent.\n\nAs compared with the rest of Assam, K\u00e1mr\u00fap displays an ethnical character approximating to that of Bengal. The higher castes of Hindus, especially the Br\u00e1hmans and Kolit\u00e1s, are well represented; and the considerable numbers both of Musalm\u00e1ns and Vaishnavs indicate traces of early civilisation. On the other hand, the aboriginal tribes are also numerous. Among the aborigines of the Census Report, the Cachar\u00eds are returned as numbering 99,293; the R\u00e1bh\u00e1s, 22,723; the Saraniy\u00e1s, 4506; the Mik\u00edrs, 15,548. These are all wild tribes of Indo-Chinese origin, whose common affinities it would be difficult to trace; they unite in repudiating the caste regulations and the purity of living enjoined by Hinduism. The G\u00e1ros are returned at 7459, and the L\u00e1lungs at 3333 in number. The semi-Hinduized aborigines of the Census are mainly composed of Kochs, who number altogether 81,551. They are of Cachar\u00ed origin; but since the Br\u00e1hmans discovered a divine origin for the Kuch Behar R\u00e1j\u00e1, his tribesmen have adopted the high-sounding appellation of R\u00e1jbansi, and submit themselves in a greater or less degree to Br\u00e1hmanical rules. The Chand\u00e1ls number 16,555; the Doms, 18,281; the Ahams, who constituted the dominant race as late as the beginning of the present century, now only show 546 members.\n\nOf Hindus proper, the Br\u00e1hmans number 36,336, divided between the two classes of Vaidik and R\u00e1h\u00ed; the R\u00e1jputs, 211; the K\u00e1yasths, 7286; the Ganaks, an impure class of Br\u00e1hmans, 6582. By far the most numerous caste is the Kolit\u00e1, numbering 140,923. These are said to have supplied the priesthood to the early Koch rulers of the country, before the introduction of Br\u00e1hmanism. They possess markedly Aryan features, and occupy a respectable position as pure Sudras. The majority are now engaged in agriculture; but some profess to identify themselves, in pursuits and in origin, with the K\u00e1yasths of Bengal. The other principal Hindu castes include\u2014Keuts or Kewats, fishermen and agriculturists, 53,203; Kat\u00e1n\u00eds, silk weavers by caste, but many are now cultivators, 19,348; Sunris or Shah\u00e1s, spirit dealers and traders, 15,103; Salais, agriculturists, 8776; Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters, 4293; Haris, goldsmiths, 4248.\n\nClassified according to religion, the population is composed of\u2014Hindus (as loosely grouped together for religious purposes), 569,906, or 91.7 per cent.; Musalm\u00e1ns, 50,452, or 8.2 per cent.; Buddhists, 690; Jains, 20; Brahmo, 1; Christians, 366, among whom are included 265 natives, converts chiefly under the charge of the American Baptist Mission; aboriginal tribes, 23,525.\n\nK\u00e1mr\u00fap is the head-quarters of a sect of Vishnuites, known as Mah\u00e1-\npur\u00fashi\u00e1s, who are described as extremely bigoted. Among religious institutions may be mentioned the s\u00e1stras or convents, 61 in number, maintained by grants of rent-free land guaranteed by the British Government, and each under the management of its own gos\u00e1in or abbot. There are also 35 devalais, which appear to differ from the s\u00e1stras in being the private property of certain families called Bardor\u00eds. In addition to these two institutions, which are of ancient origin, there are also several Beng\u00e1li Gos\u00e1ins, who are said to have immigrated into Assam in the beginning of the 18th century.\n\nThe Muhammadans of K\u00e1mr\u00fap are supposed to be descendants of the early invaders. The reforming Far\u00e1\u00edzi sect is represented, but fanaticism is not active. The religion of Isl\u00e1m has ceased to make any progress in the District, and the lower orders have mixed up much of Hindu superstition with their religion. Two sects or classes stand out distinctly from the rest of Muhammadans. They are the Gari\u00e1s or tailors, and Mari\u00e1s or braziers. These both claim to be Muhammadans by religion, but are not circumcised, and are looked upon with detestation by the more orthodox Musalm\u00e1ns. They form a low and degraded class, and appear to be of aboriginal descent. They eat beef and pork indifferently, and are much addicted to drinking habits.\n\nThe Christian community consists of 101 Europeans and Eurasians, and 265 natives. The majority of the latter are Baptists, the American Baptist Mission having a station in Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed town, and in a few villages along the foot of the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills. In the town, the Native Christians are well off, being for the most part employed either as clerks in Government offices or as servants to European residents.\n\nThere is some immigration into the District, in connection with the cultivation of tea; emigration is unknown.\n\nThe chief town in K\u00e1mr\u00fap, and the administrative head-quarters of the District, is Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed, the ancient seat of the Aham viceroy, the Bor Phuk\u00e1n, which now (1881) contains 11,695 inhabitants. The Subdivisional town of Barpeta, however, contains a larger population (13,758). The remainder of the population is absolutely rural. Out of a total of 2562 towns and villages returned in the Census Report, no less than 1515 contain less than two hundred inhabitants each; 718 have from two hundred to five hundred; 277 from five hundred to a thousand; 46 from one to two thousand; and only 6 upwards of two thousand. The people evince no tendency towards urban life, but rather the reverse. After Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed, the most important places are\u2014Diwangiri, on the slope of the northern hills, whither the Bhuti\u00e1s flock annually for trading purposes; and the temples at Hajo and Kamakhya, which attract many pilgrims from all parts of India, and even Buddhists from beyond the Him\u00e1layas. Another sacred site is a little rocky island in the middle of the\nBrahmaputra opposite Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed, called Umananda, said to have been formed by the god Siva of the dust with which he had marked his forehead.\n\nUnder the Aham dynasty, an elaborate system of local government was organized. The names of the old officials survive at the present day in certain families, as titles of social distinction; but the mauz\u00e1d\u00e1r, or fiscal officer in charge of a mauz\u00e1 or circle of villages, is the only personage now recognised by the Government. A representative body, resembling the panch\u00e1yat of the Hindus, is found among the aborigines and other low castes, under the name of mel; the members are called melk\u00eds.\n\nThe material condition of the people has much improved of late years, consequent on the demand for labour for the extension of tea cultivation, the increased rate of wages, and the spread of education and commerce. Prior to the British occupation of the Province, the mass of the population was ground down under an oppression amounting to slavery. The people are now independent and fairly prosperous, although there are but few rich men in the District. The poorer classes can all earn sufficient for their livelihood in their own villages, and they evince a great disinclination to work as labourers. The dress of a well-to-do shopkeeper consists of a cotton cloth round the waist, falling over the thighs (dh\u00f3tt), a shirt or coat, and a cotton sheet or shawl (chad\u00e1r); while that of an ordinary cultivator consists merely of a narrow piece of cotton cloth round the waist, together with a large coarse cloth for the body, reaching from the neck to the knees. The dwellings of both shopkeepers and peasants are alike, being constructed of wooden posts, bamboos, grass, canes, and reeds. They are furnished with a few wooden or cane stools, a few mats, a wooden or bamboo bedstead, several baskets or rough wooden boxes, brass plates and cups, and pots for cooking and other purposes. The food of both shopkeeping and agricultural classes consists of rice, meat for those who can afford it, pulses, vegetables of many descriptions, milk, sugar, eggs, salt, oil, chillies, onions, etc. The cultivator produces almost all the necessaries of life himself, and consequently has to spend very little on food; whereas a shopkeeper holding no land has to purchase almost everything that he consumes. Allowing for the market value of the food raised by himself, it is estimated that the monthly expenses of an ordinary peasant amount to about \u00a36s., and those of a shopkeeper to from \u00a31 to \u00a31, 4s.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census of 1881 returns the male population under the following six divisions:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including all military and civil officials, and the learned professions, 2525; (2) domestic class, 2162; (3) commercial class, including merchants, dealers, carriers, etc., 6297; (4) agricultural and pastoral\nclass, 176,884; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 5083; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, etc., 136,110.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The one staple harvest of the District is rice, which is grown in three different crops. The \u00e1us, sown broadcast on high lands, and reaped in the early summer; the b\u00e1o, which chiefly differs from the preceding in being sown and reaped somewhat later, and grown generally on marshy lands; and the s\u00e1li, corresponding to the \u00e1man of Bengal, which is sown on low lands about June, transplanted in the following month or later, and reaped in the winter. The last of these three furnishes by far the largest portion of the food supply. On \u00e1us lands are also grown cold-weather crops, such as pulses and oil-seeds. The area under rice has nearly doubled within the past thirty years. The agricultural statistics for 1881\u201382 show only 513,606 acres under cultivation, out of a total area of more than $2\\frac{1}{3}$ millions. The cultivated area is thus distributed:\u2014Rice, 432,029 acres; pulses, 23,181; oil-seeds, 31,966; sugar-cane, 5839; cotton, 3809; tea, 6302; miscellaneous, 10,480. It is estimated that the waste land capable of cultivation amounts to nearly twice as much as that already under the plough. Irrigation is practised by the Cachar\u00eds bordering on the Bhut\u00e1n frontier, who dam the hill streams, and lead the water over their fields by small artificial channels. Manure is nowhere used. The principle of the rotation of crops is unknown, but it is customary to allow \u00e1us land to lie fallow. The agricultural stock of the District in 1882\u201383 is approximately returned as follows:\u2014Cows and bullocks, 301,136; horses and ponies, 1486; donkeys, 13; sheep and goats, 34,555; and pigs, 35,478.\n\nThe State is the supreme landlord throughout Assam, and settles its land revenue demand directly with the cultivators. The number of tenants in K\u00e1mr\u00e1n in 1874\u201375 amounted to 109,504; in addition to whom there are the nisf-khir\u00e1jd\u00e1rs, who pay half the ordinary rates for cultivated land. Since 1867, the following have been the rates of rent charged, which show an increase of about twofold on those previously current:\u2014B\u00e1stu, or homestead lands, 6s. an acre; rupit, or moist lands, 3s. 9d. an acre; pharingh\u00e1ti, or dry lands, 3s. an acre. The total annual produce of an acre of rupit land is returned at about $11\\frac{1}{2}$ cwts. of rice from the s\u00e1li harvest, valued at about \u00a31, 2s. 6d.; pharingh\u00e1ti land yields about $8\\frac{1}{2}$ cwts. of \u00e1us rice, and $3\\frac{1}{2}$ cwts. of oil-seeds or pulses, valued altogether at about \u00a31, 7s.\n\nOrdinary coolies are paid at the rate of 12s. a month; agricultural labourers, 4\u00bdd. a day; skilled artisans receive as much as 15s. a day. It is found extremely difficult to obtain coolies for Government employment. Nearly all the inhabitants of the District are engaged in tilling their own little plots, and they can take up spare land in\nabundance at easy rates. Moreover, there is a deeply rooted prejudice in Assam, handed down from the days of Aham taskmasters, that to work for Government entails irremediable disgrace. Young men prefer to emigrate to remote tea plantations, rather than assist in constructing a road near their own villages. The average price of common rice is about 2s. 8d. a cwt.; fine rice from Bengal fetches as much as 8s. a cwt. Indian corn sells at half a farthing per ear, sugar-cane at one farthing per cane. During the Orissa famine of 1866, the highest price reached by common rice was 8s. 10d. a cwt.\n\nThe only natural calamity to which K\u00e1mr\u00fap is exposed is flood. Drought and blight are alike unknown. The rising of the Brahmaputra, and of the minor rivers, annually lays under water a considerable portion of the country; but these inundations have never been known to affect the general harvest, because the flooded area is only occasionally cultivated in patches. There are ten important lines of embankment in the District of old date, and a demand exists for more of these protective works.\n\nThe means of communication are amply sufficient to prevent a local scarcity from at any time intensifying into famine. The main stream of the Brahmaputra, intersecting the District, is at all seasons navigable by steamers. During the rains, nearly every village is accessible by boat; and during the rest of the year, the country roads are in fair order. These roads usually run along the ridges of old embankments, and cross the rivers by wooden bridges. The Assam Trunk Road, under the management of the Public Works Department, runs through the south of the District for a distance of 96 miles. The Trunk Road along the northern bank of the Brahmaputra is now in bad repair, and hardly at all used. The new cart road from Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed to Shillong in the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills, the administrative head-quarters of the Province of Assam, runs through K\u00e1mr\u00fap District for a distance of 15 miles as far as the Kalang river. But the main goods traffic is nearly all carried by the trading steamers on the Brahmaputra.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014Manufactures can hardly be said to exist in K\u00e1mr\u00fap. In each family there is a rough loom, on which the women weave from silk and cotton the articles required for domestic use. There is a special class called Mari\u00e1s, who support themselves by making brass cups and plates. The cultivation and manufacture of tea is conducted almost solely by European capital and under European supervision, but the soil and climate are not so favourable as in Upper Assam. The statistics for 1881 show 145 plantations, with 6186 acres under cultivation; the out-turn was 955,509 lbs.; 16 European planters or assistants were employed, with 172 imported and 1197 local labourers.\n\nThe trade of the District is mainly in the hands of Kay\u00e1 or M\u00e1rw\u00e1r\u00ed\nmerchants from R\u00e1jput\u00e1na (chiefly from Bikaner), and of Muhammadan shopkeepers. The latter confine their operations to the towns of Gauh\u00e1ti and Barpet\u00e1. The main thoroughfare of trade is the Brahmaputra, which is always open to steamers and large boats. Business is conducted at a few permanent b\u00e1z\u00e1r\u1e63, and at weekly h\u00e1ts or markets. Three large trading fairs are held in the course of the year. The chief export from the District consists of oil-seeds and timber; cotton and various jungle products are also despatched down the Brahmaputra. The articles received in exchange are Bengal table-rice, salt, piece-goods, sugar, betel-nuts, cocoa-nuts, and hardware.\n\nThe American Baptist Mission at Gauh\u00e1ti is the only institution established in the District.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1870\u201371, the total revenue of K\u00e1mr\u00fap amounted to \u00a3119,980, towards which the land-tax contributed \u00a379,726, or 66 per cent., and abk\u00e1ri or excise, \u00a330,412, or 25 per cent.; the total expenditure was \u00a3113,729, of which \u00a315,577 was for charges of collection, \u00a320,622 for the Military Department, and \u00a348,400 for Public Works. In 1881\u201382, the total revenue had increased to \u00a3125,004 (of which \u00a390,777 was derived from the land); while the expenditure had decreased to \u00a351,612. The land revenue is collected directly from the cultivators, as throughout the rest of Assam proper. The receipts from the land have nearly quadrupled within the last thirty years. In 1850, the land revenue realized \u00a324,745; by 1881 this had increased to \u00a390,777. In addition, a house-tax, a relic of the ancient revenue system, still levied from the nomadic cultivators along the foot of the Bh\u00fat\u00e1n Hills, at the rate of 4s. per house, yielded \u00a3154 in 1881\u201382.\n\nIn 1881, there were 7 magisterial and 5 civil courts open, besides 10 honorary magistrates with limited jurisdiction. In 1881, the regular police force numbered 295 officers and men, maintained at a total cost of \u00a34631. These figures show 1 policeman to every 13\u00b707 square miles, or to every 2186 of the population. In addition, there is a municipal police of 39 men in Gauh\u00e1ti town. There are no chaukid\u00e1rs, or village watch, in any part of Assam proper. The District contains one jail and one sub-divisional lock-up. In 1881, the daily average number of prisoners was 304, of whom 298 were labouring convicts, showing 1 person in jail to every 2121 of the population. The total cost amounted to \u00a31549, or \u00a35, 2s. 10d. per prisoner; the jail manufactures yielded a net profit of \u00a387. The prison death-rate was 11\u00b705 per thousand.\n\nEducation has made more progress in K\u00e1mr\u00fap than in any other part of Assam. In 1856 there were 26 schools in the District, with 74 pupils. In 1870 these numbers had risen to 66 schools, with 2114 pupils; by 1872, after the introduction of Sir G. Campbell\u2019s reforms,\nthe schools had further increased to 146, and the pupils to 3969; and by 1882, when that system had received full development, the schools numbered 232, and the pupils 6297. These last figures show 1 school to every 16 square miles, and 9 pupils to every thousand of the population. In 1882 the school expenditure was \u00a34455, towards which Government contributed \u00a31882. The chief educational establishment is the High School at Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed.\n\nK\u00e1mr\u00fap District is divided into two administrative Sub-divisions, and 10 th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles. The number of fiscal divisions in 1881\u201382 was returned at 128, with 74 estates or tracts under a separate mauz\u00e1d\u00e1r or revenue collector. The only municipality in the District is Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed town, with an area of 2 square miles, and a population of 11,695 persons. In 1880\u201381, the municipal revenue amounted to \u00a32927, the average rate of taxation being 2s. 3\u00bdd. per head.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of the District does not differ from that common to the whole of the Assam valley. The neighbourhood of Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed is exceptionally unhealthy, being shut in between the Brahmaputra and a semicircle of low hills; but much has recently been done in the way of sanitary improvements. The mean annual temperature is returned at 76\u00b0 F., the thermometer seldom rising higher than 90\u00b0. The annual rainfall at Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed over a period of about thirty years has averaged 69\u00b764 inches. The total rainfall in 1881 was 72\u00b712 inches, or 2\u00b748 inches above the average. The prevailing direction of the wind is from the north-east. During the cold weather, fogs gather daily in the early morning over the valley of the Brahmaputra.\n\nThe endemic diseases are malarious fevers, dysentery, diarrhoea, splenitis, scorbutis, and various forms of leprosy. Cholera, also, periodically makes its appearance in an epidemic form. Small-pox is said to be giving way before the growing practice of vaccination. It has been observed that the universal habit of opium-eating renders the natives less capable than elsewhere of recovering from the attacks of disease. Vital statistics are collected in Assam by the mauz\u00e1d\u00e1rs, a somewhat less inefficient agency than the chaukid\u00e1rs of Bengal. In 1881, their returns showed a death-rate of 14\u00b79 per thousand. Out of a total of 9614 deaths reported, 1503 were assigned to cholera, 988 to bowel complaints, 5725 to fevers, and 429 to small-pox. There are two dispensaries in the District, one at Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed and the other at Barp\u00e9ta, which were attended in 1881 by 257 in-door and 3630 outdoor patients; the total income was \u00a3335, towards which Government contributed \u00a314. K\u00e1mr\u00fap is liable to be ravaged by several forms of cattle disease, of which that known as maur, and described as a combination of cholera and dysentery, is especially fatal.

Together with Jir\u00e1l, these estates are owned by the same three proprietors who hold the latter. The area of the three estates together amounts to 5 square miles. The revenue derived from K\u00e1msoli Moti is \u00a3120, and the tribute paid to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, \u00a313. The revenue from K\u00e1msoli N\u00e1ni is \u00a3100, and the tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, \u00a312. The revenue of Jir\u00e1l is \u00a3170, and the tribute to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r, \u00a37. Owing to disputes among the shareholders, the estates have been under British management since 1870.\u2014See Jir\u00e1l.\n\nKamt\u00e1 Rajaula.\u2014Petty State under the Bundelkhand Agency, Central India. Area, 4 square miles. Population (1881) 1543, namely, Hindus, 1519, and Muhammadans, 24. Estimated revenue, \u00a3300. Kamt\u00e1 is a celebrated place of Hindu pilgrimage, being one of the places where R\u00e1ma is said to have stayed during his wanderings. The chief, R\u00e1o Bharat Pras\u00e1d, is a Hindu K\u00e1yasth. He holds a sanad of adoption.\n\nKamtar\u00e1n\u00e1la.\u2014State forest, thickly wooded with s\u00e1l, in R\u00e1ip\u00far District, Central Provinces, lying along an affluent of the Jonk river. Area, 25 square miles.\n\nK\u00e1mth\u00e1.\u2014Zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri estate in T\u00edror\u00e1 tahs\u00edl, Bhand\u00e1ra District, Central Provinces, paying a quit-rent to Government of \u00a34580, and comprising 126 villages, with 13,511 houses. Area, 271 square miles. Population (1881) 78,816, namely, males 38,891, and females 39,925. Conferred more than a century ago on a Kunb\u00ed family, it was confiscated on their rebelling against the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur in 1818, and granted to the ancestor of the present chief, a Lodh\u00ed, whose family, by payment of heavy fines, acquired the zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri tenure or chiefship.\n\nK\u00e1mth\u00e1.\u2014Village in K\u00e1mth\u00e1 estate, Bhand\u00e1ra District, Central Provinces. Lat. 21\u00b0 31' N., long. 80\u00b0 21' E. Population (1881) 1612, chiefly agricultural. The chief of K\u00e1mth\u00e1 has a handsome residence, surrounded by a wall and moat. He provides the conservancy, and has built a large dispensary at his sole expense. The dispensary, however, was allowed to fall out of repair, and the establishment has been removed to T\u00edror\u00e1 on the line of railway. Government school, District post-office.\n\nK\u00e1mth\u00ed (Kamptee; K\u00e1mpti).\u2014Large town and cantonment in N\u00e1gpur District, Central Provinces. Lat. 21\u00b0 13' 30\" N., long. 79\u00b0 14' 30\" E.; nine miles north-east of N\u00e1gpur city, immediately below the junction\nof the Kanh\u00e1n with the Pench and Kol\u00e1r rivers. Population (1877) 48,831; (1881) 50,987, namely, males 26,344, and females 24,643. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 36,364; Muhammadans, 11,076; Christians, 2396; Jains, 380; Kabirpanthis, 11; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 39; and aboriginal tribes, 721. The town and cantonments form one municipality, but affairs are managed by separate committees. Total municipal income in 1882\u201383, \u00a36521, of which \u00a36245 was derived from octroi duties; average incidence of taxation, 2s. 5\u00bdd. per head.\n\nThe military lines and b\u00e1z\u00e1rs are laid out along the right bank of the Kanh\u00e1n on the principle of a camp, except that the cavalry are on the extreme left. A broad road, about four miles long, runs right through, and is maintained at the expense of the cantonment fund. In 1879, the military force, which till recently was a first-class brigade command, belonging to the Madras establishment, consisted of three batteries of European artillery, a regiment of Native cavalry, a regiment of European infantry, and a regiment and a half of Native infantry. The strength of the European troops has lately been reduced, and now there is only one battery of European artillery stationed at K\u00e1mth\u00ed. An extensive parade ground, south-east of the cantonment, separates it from the town, which is built in broad and regular streets, and in 1881 contained 14,391 houses. A considerable trade is carried on in cattle, country cloth, salt, and European piece-goods. The M\u00e1rv\u00e1ris have the grain trade almost entirely in their hands. There is also a brisk traffic in timber, floated down the rivers to the town. The latest town improvements are\u2014an excellent masonry tank, constructed partly at the cost of Bansil\u00e1l Abirchand R\u00e1i Bah\u00e1dur, an influential resident; the Temple Gardens, for recreation; a good sar\u00edi; and a large central market-place.\n\nA fine bridge, erected at a cost of about \u00a390,000, spans the Kanh\u00e1n river at the east end of the cantonment, and is crossed by the N\u00e1gpur and Chhat\u00edsgarh State Railway, which has a station at K\u00e1mth\u00ed. The town has its dispensary, schools, and dharm\u00e1s\u00e1l\u00e1s for travellers; and the cantonment contains a large building used for public purposes. There is a commodious Protestant church, built in 1833; and a Roman Catholic establishment of the order of St. Francis de Sales, with a convent and church; in addition to 5 Muhammadan mosques and 70 Hindu temples.\n\nK\u00e1mth\u00ed dates only from the establishment of the cantonment in 1821. It used to be thought unhealthy, but, owing to sanitary improvements, the death-rate of late years has greatly decreased. The supply of water is drawn chiefly from the Kanh\u00e1n, supplemented by a large tank and 460 wells.\n\nK\u00e1n.\u2014River of M\u00e1lw\u00e1, Central India.\u2014See Khan.\nK\u00e1n\u00e1-D\u00e1modar.\u2014Watercourse in H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal; formerly one of the main outlets of the D\u00e1modar into the H\u00fagl\u00ed. It branches off from the present D\u00e1modar near the point where the K\u00e1n\u00e1 n\u00e1d\u00ed leaves that river, and flows southwards through H\u00fagl\u00ed District parallel to the D\u00e1modar. In the lower portion of its course it is known as the K\u00e1nson\u00e1 kh\u00e1l, under which name it enters the H\u00fagl\u00ed river about 5 miles above R\u00e1ipur and 1 mile north of Ulub\u00e1ria.\n\nKan\u00e1igir\u00ed.\u2014Fort in Nellore District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Kanigiri.\n\nK\u00e1n\u00e1-n\u00e1d\u00ed.\u2014Watercourse in H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal; formerly the main channel of the D\u00e1modar, but now a petty stream. It branches off from the present D\u00e1modar near Sal\u00edm\u00e1b\u00e1d in South Bardw\u00e1n, whence it flows south-east and east through H\u00fagl\u00ed District till it joins the Ghi\u00e1 n\u00e1d\u00ed, when, under the name of the Kunti n\u00e1d\u00ed or Nay\u00e1-sar\u00e1i kh\u00e1l, it falls into the H\u00fagl\u00ed river at Nay\u00e1-sar\u00e1i, thus establishing a connection between the D\u00e1modar and the H\u00fagl\u00ed. A cutting was recently made through the silted-up mouth of this river; the silt having shut off the villages from their water-supply. It now carries off a considerable portion of the D\u00e1modar water, and is largely made use of for irrigation.\n\nKanandag\u00fadi.\u2014Town in the Tanjore t\u00e1luk of Tanjore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 10\u00b0 39' N., long. 79\u00b0 20' E. Population (1871) 2840; (1881) 1779, occupying 236 houses. Hindus numbered 1700, and Christians 79. Formerly an important station of the S. P. G. Mission.\n\nK\u00e1nara (Canara), North.\u2014District of Bombay Presidency, in the western Karn\u00e1tic, between lat. 13\u00b0 52' and 15\u00b0 31' N., and between long. 74\u00b0 10' and 75\u00b0 7' E. Bounded on the north by Belg\u00e1um District; on the east by Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District and Mysore State; on the south by South K\u00e1nara, in the Madras Presidency; on the west for about 76 miles by the Arabian Sea; and on the north-west by the territory of Goa. Area, 3911 square miles. Population (1881) 421,840 persons. Chief town and seaport, Karwar. The District is not to be confounded with the District of South K\u00e1nara in Madras. North K\u00e1nara is the most southerly of the coast Districts of the Bombay Presidency.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The Sahyadri range of the Western Gh\u00e1ts, varying in height from 2500 to 3000 feet, runs through the District from north to south, dividing it into two parts, viz. the uplands or B\u00e1lg\u00e1gh\u00e1t (area, about 3000 square miles), and the lowlands or Payangh\u00e1t (area, about 1300 square miles). The coast-line is only broken by the K\u00e1rw\u00e1r headland in the north, and by the estuaries of four rivers and the mouths of many smaller streams, through which the salt water finds an entrance into numerous lagoons winding several miles inland. The shore, though generally sandy, is in some parts rocky. Fringing its\nmargin, and behind the banks of the brushwood-bordered lagoons, rise groves of cocoa-nut palms, and inland from this line of palms stretches a narrow strip of level rice land. The whole breadth of the lowlands, never more than 15 miles, is in some places not more than 5 miles. From this narrow belt rise a few smooth, flat-topped hills, from 200 to 300 feet high; and at places it is crossed by lofty, rugged, densely-wooded spurs, which, starting from the main range of the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills, maintain almost to the coast a height of not less than 1000 feet. Among these hills lie well-tilled valleys of garden and rice land. The plateau of the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t is irregular, varying from 1500 to 2000 feet in height. In some parts the country rises into well-wooded knolls, in others it is studded by small, isolated, steep hills. Except on the banks of streams and in the more open glades, the whole is one broad waste of woodland and forest. The open spaces are dotted over with hamlets or parcelled out into rice clearings.\n\nStretching across the watershed of the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills, North K\u00e1nara contains two sets of rivers\u2014one flowing west to the Arabian Sea, the other east towards the Bay of Bengal. Of the eastern streams, the Warda, a tributary of the Tungabhadra, alone calls for mention. Of those that flow westwards, four are of some importance\u2014the K\u00e1l\u00ed in the north, the Gang\u00e1w\u00e1li and Tadri in the centre, and the Shir\u00e1wati in the south. The last of these, plunging over a cliff 825 feet in height, about 35 miles above the town of Hon\u00e1w\u00e1r, forms the famous Gersoppa Falls. Along the coast, the quality of the water is good, and the supply throughout the year abundant. Total number of wells in 1881, 25,744.\n\nThe prevailing rocks are granite and trap, the former largely predominating. At the base of the granite hills, laterite formation is common. Along the coast from K\u00e1rw\u00e1r to Hon\u00e1w\u00e1r, the surface rock is almost entirely hard laterite, a stone admirably adapted for building purposes. Iron-ore occurs in some portions of the District, and limestone is found in the valley of Y\u00e1n, about 18 miles from K\u00fampta (Coompta).\n\nThe forests of North K\u00e1nara give its character to the District. They flourish both below and above the line of the Sahy\u00e1dri Hills, and have, during past years, yielded an average annual net revenue of \u00a339,307. Though all the forests contain many varieties of trees, they may be arranged in three classes, severally distinguished by the predominance of ain (Terminalia tomentosa), teak (Tectona grandis), and the Karvi bush. Along the K\u00e1l\u00ed river and its affluent, the Renery, stretch fine forests of teak trees, with smooth, shapely stems, rising without a branch to a height of 70 feet. The working of the reserves is under the direct charge of the Forest Department. Each season, the trees suited for felling are marked by the forest officers; and the timber, when cut, is removed by contract to a d\u00e9p\u00f4t, and there sold by public\nauction. The cultivators are allowed to gather dry wood for fuel, and leaves for manure, and to cut bamboos and brushwood for their huts and cattle-sheds. They are also supplied, free of charge, with such timber as they require for their own use. In former years, most of the produce of the K\u00e1nara forests went westwards to the sea-coast, finding its chief markets in Bombay and Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t). Of late years the sea trade has fallen off, and the bulk of the timber is now taken eastward to the open country in and beyond Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r.\n\nK\u00e1nara is almost the only part of the Bombay Presidency abounding in wild animals. Tigers, common and black leopards, bears, hy\u00e6nas, wild dogs, bison, s\u00e1mbhar, and wild hog are still numerous. Several varieties of deer, porcupines, hares, jackals, foxes, and wild cats are also to be found. Of winged game there are pea-fowl, jungle-fowl, florican, spur-fowl, partridges, snipe, quail, duck, widgeon, and teal.\n\nHistory.\u2014The early history of the North K\u00e1nara District is included in the succeeding article on SOUTH KANARA. Until 1861, North K\u00e1nara formed part of the Presidency of Madras. In that year, on the ground of its nearness to Bombay and the close mercantile relations existing between the Bombay merchants and the traders of K\u00e1rw\u00e1r, K\u00fampta, and Hon\u00e1w\u00e1r, the District was transferred to the Bombay Presidency.\n\nPopulation, etc.\u2014The Census of 1872 disclosed a total population of 398,406 persons, residing in 1065 villages and 91,593 houses; density of population, 94 per square mile; houses per square mile, 21; persons per village, 374; persons per house, 4\u00b735. The Census of 17th February 1881 discovered a population of 421,840; so that in the nine years since the previous Census the population had increased by 23,434. The population (421,480) occupied 7 towns and 102 villages, dwelling in 68,832 houses; average density, 107\u00b79 persons per square mile. Classified according to sex, there were, in 1881\u2014males 223,005, and females 198,835; proportion of males, 52\u00b78 per cent. Towns and villages per square mile, 0\u00b728; houses per square mile, 19\u00b71; persons per house, 6\u00b712. Of the whole population, 153,214, or 36 per cent., are under 15 years of age. The religious classification shows 381,328 Hindus, 24,282 Musalm\u00e1ns, 17 P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 14,509 Christians, 1669 Jains, 25 Jews, and 10 Buddhists. Among Hindus, the most noteworthy class is the Havik Br\u00e1hmans (63,865), who make their livelihood by spice and areca-nut gardens. R\u00e1jputs number 344; Kunbis, 51,057; Kumbh\u00e1rs, 2161; Lohars (blacksmiths), 834; Mahar or Dhers, 15,785; Son\u00e1rs (goldsmiths), 10,158; Sutars, 3220; Telis (oilmen), 1971; 'other' Hindus 231,933. Muhammadans are distributed as follows:\u2014Path\u00e1ns, 2155; Sayyids, 2773; Shaikhs, 18,954; 'others,' 400.\nBesides the regular Muhammadan population (descendants of local converts to Isl\u00e1m), generally in poor circumstances, employed chiefly in agriculture and by Government as messengers and police, there are, in K\u00e1nara, two special bodies of foreign Muhammadan settlers. Of these, the most important and well-to-do are the Nav\u00e1yat\u00e1s or seamen, representatives of the colonies of Arab merchants, of whom a remnant still exists along the whole coast-line of the Bombay Presidency, from Gogo southwards. The other foreign Musalm\u00e1n community is the Sid\u00eds, descendants of African slaves formerly owned by the Portuguese. Although they have intermarried for several generations with the low-caste population of the District, the Sid\u00eds have not lost their original peculiarities. They still possess the woolly hair and black skin of the pure negro. They are for the most part very poor, and, settled in remote forests, live on the produce of little patches of rude cultivation.\n\nThe Christians in the District, who are almost all Roman Catholics, belong to two classes, of which the first consists of a few families from Goa, of Portuguese extraction, though much mixed by intermarriage with the natives of the country; the second are descendants of local converts to Christianity. Christians of the higher class are clerks, the rest principally artisans and labourers. The total number of Christians in 1881 was 14,509, of whom 14,390 were Roman Catholics, 62 Presbyterians, and 39 Episcopalians, 2 Lutherans, and 16 'other' Protestants.\n\nAs regards occupation, the Census of 1881 distributed the males into the following six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every description and the learned professions, 6217; (2) domestic class, including servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 3986; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 4343; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 97,514; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 21,366; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 89,579.\n\nOf the 1109 towns and villages in North K\u00e1nara District, 547 contained in 1881 a population of less than two hundred; 382 from two to five hundred; 111 from five hundred to one thousand; 47 from one to two thousand; 8 from two to three thousand; 6 from three to five thousand; 6 from five to ten thousand; and 2 from ten to fifteen thousand.\n\nThere are famous Jain temples at Gersoppa and Bhatkal, and forts of some antiquity at Mirj\u00e1n and Sad\u00e1shivgad. Gokarn and Banw\u00e1si, also, have fine old granite temples.\n\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014Agriculture gives employment to 260,897 persons, or 61\u00b784 per cent. of the entire population. Of the total number, 150,059 are returned as 'workers,' and the remainder as 'dependants.' The cultivated portions of the low lands are either sandy plains, lying\nalong the shore and the banks of rivers, or narrow, well-watered valleys, which are for the most part planted with rice, cocoa-nut groves, and areca or betel-nut gardens. In the uplands, the soil is generally a stiff clay, retentive of moisture. Owing to the want of inhabitants, and also to the malarious climate, many fertile and well-irrigated valleys lie waste, and covered with forest. North K\u00e1nara has not yet (1884) been surveyed, and no trustworthy statistics are available as to the area under cultivation or that devoted to the different crops. An approximate estimate in 1872 returned the area under tillage at 333,175 acres, or 12\u00b72 per cent. of the total area of the District as then constituted.\n\nRice, of which there are many varieties, is the staple crop. R\u00e1gi (Eleusine corocana), sugar-cane, and safflower are also grown to a considerable extent; and cocoa-nuts, areca-nuts, the lesser cardamoms (Elettaria Cardamomum), and pepper are produced in gardens in large quantities for home consumption and for export. The culture of chayroot is still very limited, but its red, black, and chocolate dyes are coming into repute in Europe. Cochineal is largely exported to England. Coffee is grown to a very small extent; and, compared with the system followed by European planters in the Wyn\u00e1d and Mysore State, its cultivation is slovenly. Rice and garden lands are irrigated, the water being obtained from perennial streams. Near villages, especially on the coast, there are groves and avenues of Alexandrian laurel, which attains a large size. The cocoa-nut palm (Cocos nucifera) is common along the coast, and is the chief liquor-yielding tree in the District. The approximate area of land under cocoa-nut palms is 13,700 acres, which at a rough average of 100 trees per acre gives a total of 1,370,000 trees. In 1882\u201383, the tapping fee was six shillings per tree. Palms grown solely for their nuts are calculated to yield on good coast garden land a net yearly profit of about \u00a35. The areca-nut gardens, which are situated in the upland valleys, are surrounded by strong fences, within which are planted rows of cocoa-nut, jack, and mango trees. The p\u00e1n or betel-leaf creeper (Piper betle) is extensively grown; also the areca palm. The upland gardens also contain pepper, cardamoms, ginger, plantains; and sometimes pumelo, orange, lime, and iron-wood trees (n\u00e1g-ch\u00e1mpa) (Mesua ferrea) are found in these higher tracts.\n\nFormerly, in the most open parts of the forest, nomadic cultivation by brushwood burning (kum\u00e1ri) was carried on, principally by tribes of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 extraction. In the cold season, the hillmen used to cut down the bushes and lower branches of the larger trees, and burn them before the rains set in. In some places the seed was sown in the ashes on the fall of the first rains, the soil having been untouched by implements of any kind.\nCompared with the rest of Bombay, the greater part of North K\u00e1nara has hitherto nominally been in the hands of large proprietors. But since the introduction of the Revenue Survey, the ease with which land can be divided has shown that many of the large estates were in reality groups of moderate-sized holdings. In 1882-83, the agricultural stock of the District consisted of 286,365 horned cattle, 454 horses, 116 asses, 7020 sheep and goats, 45,539 ploughs, and 4561 carts.\n\nCommerce, etc.\u2014The District contains 12 ports, of which five\u2014K\u00e1rw\u00e1r, K\u00fampta, Ankola, Bhatkal, and Hon\u00e1w\u00e1r\u2014are important. Out of \u00a31,841,173 (the total value of the trade at these ports in 1876), \u00a31,199,077 represented exports, and \u00a3642,096 imports. In 1881, the value of the imports into K\u00e1rw\u00e1r alone, the chief town and port of the District, was \u00a3189,776; and the value of the exports in the same year, \u00a3272,714. Rice, cotton, timber, cocoa-nuts, and spices are the principal articles of export. The cotton comes from Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, Mysore, Bellary, and the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions, and is shipped from K\u00e1rw\u00e1r and K\u00fampta. The chief articles of import are piece-goods, silk, metal, sugar, and spirits. The K\u00e1rw\u00e1r and K\u00fampta carvers in sandal-wood and ebony have successfully exhibited their workmanship at many Industrial Exhibitions in Europe. Salt, made from January to June in lands rented from Government, is one of the chief manufactures. Oil-pressing from cocoa-nuts is also an important industry. Government sawmills are situated near Yell\u00e1pur in the heart of the forest. Lighthouses are situated at Karwar, Kumpta, and Oyster Rock (q.v.). The most important annual fairs are at Gokarn, Sirsi, and Ulvi in Supa. The principal lines of road are from K\u00e1dra to Belg\u00e1um via Supa, from K\u00e1rw\u00e1r to Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r via Yell\u00e1pur, from K\u00fampta to Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r via Sirsi, and the coast road from Ankola to Belki. Besides these trunk roads many branch lines have been made. Rates of interest vary according to the credit of the borrower, from 12 to 24 per cent. per annum. Except a few Christians, the labouring classes are almost all Hindus.\n\nThe daily wages of unskilled labour vary from 3d. to 6d., and of skilled labour from 1s. to 2s. The hire of carts per diem is from 2s. to 4s. each; and of boats, 1s. 6d. to 6s. The current prices, per maund of 80 lbs., of the chief articles of food during 1882-83 were\u2014rice, 8s. 6d. for the best, and 6s. 10d. for the second quality; wheat, 6s. 6d.; millets, 5s.; gram, 6s. 6d.; salt, 6s. 7d.; d\u00e1l, or split peas, 7s. 4d.; gh\u00ed, \u00a33, 14s. 9d.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total gross imperial revenue of North K\u00e1nara District amounted in 1882-83 to \u00a3147,780. The land-tax, as elsewhere throughout India, forms the principal source of revenue, yielding \u00a388,316. Excise duties brought in \u00a312,873; stamps, \u00a36991; forest produce, \u00a347,720. The District local funds, created since 1863 for\nworks of public utility and rural education, amounted to \u00a37312. There are 6 municipalities with an aggregate municipal population of 39,757, and a total income (1882-83) of \u00a33948; municipal expenditure, \u00a34033; incidence of municipal taxation, 1s. 7d. per head of the population. The administration of North K\u00e1nara, in revenue matters, is entrusted to a Collector and two Assistants, who are covenanted civilians, with a Deputy Collector for treasury work.\n\nFor the settlement of civil disputes there are 5 courts; 26 officers share the administration of criminal justice. The average distance of villages from nearest court is 10 miles. Total strength of the regular police, 662 officers and men, averaging 1 man to every 5.9 square miles and to every 636 persons. Yearly cost of police, \u00a311,192, being \u00a32, 17s. 2d. per square mile, and 6\u00bdd. per head of population.\n\nEducation has spread widely of late years. In 1865-66 there were 16 schools, attended by 929 pupils; by 1882-83 the number of schools had risen to 121, with 8351 pupils, or nearly 2 per cent. of the population, averaging 1 school for every 9 inhabited villages. There are three libraries or reading-rooms in the District, one at K\u00e1rw\u00e1r of considerable size, one at K\u00fampta, and one at Sirsi. There is also a printing press in the District.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The rainfall varies on the coast from 100 inches a year at K\u00e1rw\u00e1r to 163 at K\u00fampta. In the uplands the rainfall is less, being on an average about 72 inches. Fever of a severe type is the prevalent disease. In 1860, a severe epidemic of fever broke out, and, gradually spreading over the whole District, extended eastwards into the rice tracts of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r. During 1861 and 1862, the fever raged with great severity both along the sea-coast and in the Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Hubli Sub-divisions. The Sanitary Commissioner to the Bombay Government was deputed to investigate the cause, but no definite results were arrived at. The people believed that the appearance of the disease was recurrent in cycles of eighty Jupiter or sixty solar years, together with the flowering of the bamboo. The bamboo has, however, since then flowered and died throughout the District, but no increase in the local fever is apparent. During 1872, small-pox was very prevalent. In 1881, 9 dispensaries afforded relief to 988 in-door and 36,981 out-door patients, and in 1882-83, 11,802 persons were vaccinated. The death-rate in 1882 was returned at 25.6 per thousand; but this must be considerably below the truth, as the average for the previous five years was 40 per thousand. [For further information regarding North K\u00e1nara, see the Bombay Gazetteer, vol. xv. parts I. and II., published under Government orders (Government Central Press, Bombay, 1883). Also Selections from the Records of the Bombay Government, No. clxiii., 1883; the Bombay Census Report of 1881; and the several\nK\u00e1nara (Canara), South.\u2014District in the Madras Presidency; situated on the western coast, between $14^\\circ 31'$ and $15^\\circ 31'$ N. lat., and between $74^\\circ 1'$ and $75^\\circ 2'$ E. long. It is bounded on the north by North K\u00e1nara (Bombay Presidency), on the south by Malab\u00e1r, on the east by Mysore State and Coorg, and on the west by the Indian Ocean. Area, 3902 square miles. Population (1881) 959,514. The administrative head-quarters and chief town is Mangalore.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014South K\u00e1nara is intersected with streams, and, from the broken nature of the country, the scenery is most varied and picturesque. Abundant vegetation, extensive forests, numerous groves of cocoa-nut palms along the coast, and rice-fields in every valley, give refreshing greenness to the prospect. The most densely inhabited tract, which is situated along the seaboard from north to south of its entire length, and extends into the interior for from 5 to 25 miles, may be roughly described as a broken table-land of laterite, the height of which varies from 200 to 400 feet near the coast and rises to 600 feet towards the Western Gh\u00e1ts. Inland, this so-called table-land is bounded by the lower spurs running down from the Gh\u00e1ts. These spurs, which are numerous and of every conceivable form, are for the most part forest-clad, and consist, like the parent mountains, of gneiss, schist, quartz, hornblende, and granite. Of detached mountains, properly so called, there are none; but the rock of Jamal\u00e1b\u00e1d, near Beltangadi, and the hill known as the Ass\u2019s Ears, are well-known landmarks. The laterite downs near the coast are furrowed in every direction by numerous valleys of rich alluvial soil, by which the heavy rainfall of the southwestern monsoon drains away. The laterite itself is an iron clay lying on the top of a granite bed. The granite is found at the base of every river, and constantly breaks above the surface of the laterite in round conical hills, sometimes covered with small trees, and in other places naked and bare.\n\nThe Western Gh\u00e1ts, rising from 3000 to 6000 feet, form a bulwark and boundary on the eastern side of the District. They are crossed by several passes. The chief of these passes are the Sampaji, Agumbi, Charm\u00e1di, Haidargadi or Hassangadi, Manjar\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Kol\u00far, all of which connect the plateau of Mysore and Coorg with the lowlands of South K\u00e1nara. Up to these passes, good cart roads lead from Mangalore.\n\nNone of the rivers of the District exceeds 100 miles in length. All take their rise in the Western Gh\u00e1ts, and, owing to the unfailing and heavy monsoon, become raging torrents at one time of the year and sluggish streams at another. Many of them are navigable during the dry season for from 15 to 25 miles from the coast, and admit of a\nconsiderable boat traffic, which brings down to the coast the coffee and other produce of Mysore and Coorg, and the rice grown in the interior. The principal of these rivers are the Netr\u00e1vati, the Gurg\u00far, the Gangoli (or Gurget-hole), and the Chendragiri (or Puiswinni). From the nature of the country, with its numberless streams and their uncertain fords, the loss from drowning every year is considerable, the annual average number of deaths being 130. Owing to the rapid fall of the streams, especially in the interior, water might be used as a motive power without difficulty, but it is not so applied by the people. There is a small and pretty lake at K\u00e1rk\u00e1l, and an undrained fresh-water lagoon at Kundapur.\n\nThe District is rich in a fine clay, well adapted for pottery, and several firms are engaged in the manufacture of machine-made tiles, etc. Kaolin is also of frequent occurrence underlying the laterite. Gold is found in small quantities at Mij\u00e1r, garnets at Subramanya and Kemphalla. Iron exists in the Udipi and Upp\u00e1rangadi t\u00e1luks, but it is not worked.\n\nThe forest land is of vast extent, but the exact area is unknown, as the District has never been surveyed. Most of the land is private property, and only a few forests near the Gh\u00e1ts are owned by Government. At present the large timber forests are almost entirely confined to scattered portions of the Gh\u00e1ts and the immediate neighbourhood. Great portion of the uncultivated tract reaches to within a few miles of the coast, and supports a secondary and fuel-producing growth,\u2014broken up and terminated towards the seaboard by undulating pasture ground of somewhat poor description. The Forest Department has failed to realize much revenue, owing to unsettled claims of the r\u00e2yats to the greater portion of the forest. The principal products are\u2014timber, bamboos, fuel, cardamoms, wild arrowroot (Curcuma angustifolia), gall-nuts, gamboge, catechu; fibrous barks (several kinds), cinnamon (both bark and oil); gums; resins (from several forest trees, principally from the genus Dipterocarpus); dyes (various, but mainly of a sombre colour). These products, together with honey and beeswax, are collected by the Malaikidis or hillmen; but the total export from the District is not important. There is a large yearly out-turn of sandal oil, amounting in value to over \u00a315,000, but this is merely manufactured in K\u00e1nara, the sandal-wood being brought from Mysore for the purpose. Of timber trees, the best both in quality and quantity are the following:\u2014Matti or banap\u00fa (Terminalia tomentosa), kir\u00e1l boghi (Hopea parviflora), irul or jambe (Xylia dolabriformis), marawa or hon\u00e1l (Terminalia paniculata), blackwood (Dalbergia latifolia), jack (Artocarpus integrifolia), wild jack (Artocarpus hirsuta), wild mango (Mangifera indica), poon spar (Calophyllum tomentosum), ebony (Diospyros Ebenum), iron-wood (Mesua ferrea), palmyra (Borassus flabelliformis), cedar (Cedrela Toon), bengay (Pterocarpus Marsupium),\nben teak (Lagerstroemia, more than one species), and others of the genera Terminalia, Acacia, Dalbergia, and Dipterocarpus. The forests formerly abounded in game, which, however, is rapidly decreasing under incessant shooting without any close season. One effect of the great destruction of game is, that tigers and other beasts of prey are driven by the decreasing quantity of hog and deer to feed upon cattle. Elephants, tiger, leopard, sambhar, the axis, and other small deer, and wild hog are to be found; but the K\u00e1nara jungles are the especial home of the bison. The people will not kill snakes, and, as a rule, no rewards are claimed for their destruction. The total number of deaths in 1882 from snake-bite and from wild beasts is returned at 27.\n\nHistory.\u2014The history of South K\u00e1nara is not easily traced. From an ethnological standpoint, the country has no independent existence. The southern portion is Malay\u00e1lam, the middle Tuluva, and only the north in any sense K\u00e1narese. The very name is a misnomer. K\u00e1nara or the K\u00e1rnatadesa (the country where the K\u00e1narese people dwell and the K\u00e1narese tongue is spoken) is properly the land above the Gh\u00e1ts, of which Mysore, Coorg, and part of the Ceded Districts form the most considerable tract. By one of the strange errors of history, the name strictly applicable to this region (K\u00e1rnatic) has been transferred to the Tamil country below the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts, while the name of K\u00e1nara is given to the Malabar-Tuluva country on the western coast. South K\u00e1nara, at least as far north as Udipi, formed part of the ancient kingdom of Ker\u00e1la; and certainly, as far north as the Chendragiri river, the people and language belong to Malab\u00e1r. Passing over the legendary period of Parasu R\u00e1ma, in 1252 A.D. a Pandyan prince is found conquering and ruling the country, and his successors giving place (1336) to the Vijayanagar R\u00e1j. In 1564, when the power of the latter dynasty was broken at the battle of T\u00e1l\u00edkot, the governor of Bedn\u00far (originally only a rich r\u00e1y\u00e1t) threw off his allegiance and established the kingdom of Bedn\u00far, to which in process of time K\u00e1nara from Honor to Nileshw\u00e1r was added. In the earlier dealings of the Company's factors with the Cherakal R\u00e1j\u00e1, this kingdom is spoken of as 'our enemy Canara.' The northern part of K\u00e1nara, probably as far south as the confines of Tuluva, was ruled in early times by the Kadamba (A.D. 161 to 714) and Ballala (714-1335) dynasties. The Ikkeri R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Tuluva (1560 to 1763), like the Bedn\u00far R\u00e1j\u00e1s, to whom latterly they became feudatory, rose to power on the ruins of Vijayanagar.\n\nIn 1763, when Haidar Al\u00ed conquered Bedn\u00far, he despatched detachments to secure the western coast; and Mangalore and Basr\u00far were occupied within a few months of the fall of the capital. Immediate steps were taken to utilize the possession of the seaboard and to found a Mysorean navy; and in 1766, Haidar passed through the District to\nthe conquest of Malab\u00e1r. Two years afterwards, an English force from Bombay captured Haidar's fleet, and occupied Honor and Mangalore, only to surrender them a few months later to Haidar's troops under Tip\u00fa. One of Tip\u00fa's first acts was the deportation and forcible conversion to Muhammadanism of a large portion of the Christian inhabitants of K\u00e1nara. In 1783\u201384, South K\u00e1nara was again the scene of war between the English and Mysore troops, which terminated, after a gallant defence of over nine months, in the evacuation of Mangalore. South K\u00e1nara finally became a British possession in 1791.\n\nIn 1834, on the occasion of the deposition of the Coorg R\u00e1j\u00e1, the inhabitants of Amara and Suliya petitioned for annexation. In 1837, the Government complied with their request, and the Maganis were added to the Putt\u00far Division of South K\u00e1nara. This, however, caused great dissatisfaction. One Kalianappa Subraya, taking advantage of the feeling of loyalty still retained towards the old Coorg dynasty, raised an insurrection in the same year. The imbecility of the commandant of the troops and the timidity of the Collector gave courage to what was at first a mere riot. The insurrection spread, and the troops retreated from Putt\u00far to Mangalore. The rebels followed and sacked the civil offices and jail in the face of the troops, but soon retired and broke up into small gangs of marauders. These were speedily dispersed, and the ringleaders seized and punished; and in a very short while the whole country was quieted. At no time was this insurrection formidable; the men were armed with clubs and a few matchlocks, and a determined front would have broken it at any time. The records were destroyed, however, and much property plundered. In 1860 the Province was divided into two Districts, North and South K\u00e1nara, of which the former was transferred to the Bombay Presidency in 1862.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of the District has been enumerated from time to time. Before 1871, the returns were made up by the village officers as part of their ordinary duty. An elaborate and complete Census of the District, taken in 1871, disclosed a total population of 919,513 persons, of whom 787,183 were Hindus, 82,803 Muhammadans, 49,517 Christians, and 10 'others.' The population in 1881 was returned at 959,514, living in 3 towns and 1279 villages, occupying 171,432 houses; average density, 246 persons to the square mile. Males numbered 472,236, or 49\u00b72 per cent. of the whole; females, 487,278. Towns and villages per square mile, 328; houses per square mile, 44; persons per house, 5\u00b76.\n\nDistributed according to religion, Hindus numbered 797,430; Muhammadans, 93,652; Christians, 58,215; Jains, 10,044; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 16; and 'others,' 157. Among the Hindus were \u2014 Br\u00e1hmans, 106,415; R\u00e1jputs, 287; Balijas, 94,464; Valayans, 36,099; Goudas, 41,338; Kamm\u00e1lans, 22,513; Kushavans, 24,883; Parayans, 130,000; Idigas,\n136,146; Vanniyans, 10,918; and other less numerous castes. The Muhammadans include 273 Mappil\u00e1s, 7 Mughals, 350 Path\u00e1ns, 49 Sayyids, 282 Shaikhs, and 92,691 \u2018unspecified.\u2019\n\nOf the 1282 towns and villages in the District, 236 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 400 from two to five hundred; 370 from five hundred to one thousand; 198 from one to two thousand; 48 from two to three thousand; 24 from three to five thousand; 5 from five to ten thousand; and 1 over twenty thousand. The principal of these towns are Mangalore, Bantw\u00e1l, and Udupi.\n\nThe male population is, for the purpose of exhibiting the occupations of the people, divided into six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every description, and the learned professions, 11,946; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 5623; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 10,516; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 220,086; (5) industrial class, including manufacturers and artisans, 40,898; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 183,167.\n\nThe inhabitants of South K\u00e1nara are of four races\u2014Hindus, half-caste Portuguese, Arabs, and aborigines. The Hindus may be divided into two classes\u2014those undoubtedly of Aryan descent, such as the Saraswat\u00ed Br\u00e1hmans, and perhaps the Konk\u00e1n\u00ed Br\u00e1hmans; and those probably of the Dravidian stock, Sivali Br\u00e1hmans, Bants, Jains, and perhaps Koragars and Holiyars. Of the half-caste Portuguese, native Christians (originally immigrants from Goa) form a considerable part. The Mappil\u00e1s, of Arab descent, profess the Muhammadan faith. The aborigines include Malaikudis, Koragars, and probably the Holiyars, the latter being Pariahs or out-castes. The Malaikudis are an aboriginal race inhabiting the forests, many of whom have either migrated to the coffee plantations or remain in a state of serfdom to the proprietors. They practise the nomadic system of agriculture, known as kum\u00e1ri. Of the so-called Br\u00e1hmans, a very large section are cultivating Br\u00e1hmans, arbitrarily elevated to that caste, and not acknowledged by the legitimate or Aryan Br\u00e1hmans. The Christians are not confined to the towns, but mingle with the other castes in every occupation. The Census of 1881 returns a total of 3320 Protestants. By far the larger part of the Christians are Roman Catholics, who are returned in the same Census at 54,660. Of the last number, over 13,000 are stated to be natives. Formerly, the Basel Moravian Mission (founded in 1838) was most active in the District, but the Jesuit Order has of late been very energetic in its operations. The chief languages spoken in South K\u00e1nara are\u2014apart from the European tongues and the Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed of foreigners\u2014Tulu, Malay\u00e1lam, K\u00e1narese, and Konk\u00e1n\u00ed. Tulu, the language of Tuluva, is spoken generally\nbetween Udupi and Kumbla, by perhaps 180,000 people; south of the Puiswinni river, and elsewhere with Mappil\u00e1s, Malay\u00e1lam is the prevailing tongue. K\u00e1narese, being the official language, is understood everywhere. Konk\u00e1n\u00ed is the domestic language of some castes, and of all the Goa Christians.\n\nMangalore is the most important town in the District, and the only municipality. It has a population of 32,099 persons, and an annual municipal revenue of about \u00a33000.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The staple crop of South K\u00e1nara is rice. Cocoa-nut gardens are numerous along the coast, and areca plantations in the interior. Gram, beans, hemp, r\u00e1gi, sugar-cane, tobacco, and cotton are grown, but not to any extent. Of the total area in 1882-83 (2,808,587 acres), 33,635 acres were ind\u00e1m or revenue free. Area cultivated, 371,305 acres, of which 209,627 acres were cultivated again for a second crop. Cereals occupied 490,804 acres; pulses, 39,721; orchard and garden produce, 27,779; drugs and narcotics, 603; condiments and spices, 15,520; sugar, 1771; oils, 4568; and fibres, 166. The irrigated area was 232,250 acres, of which 163,396 acres were irrigated a second time for another crop. The total area assessed consisted of 411,192 acres, the amount of assessment being \u00a3160,370. The land is thus classified according to its capacity for irrigation\u2014byle, or rich wet land; mazal, or middling wet land; and bettu, or land watered only by the rainfall. On byle land of the best quality, three rice crops can be raised in the year; on the best mazal land, two crops; bettu land produces only a single crop. The yenulu or karti is the earliest rice crop of the season, on whatever description of land it may be grown. The seed is first sown in nurseries, which are highly manured, and the plants are afterwards transplanted. In about two months after transplantation, the crop comes into ear, and in about twenty-one days more is ready for reaping. Experiments have been made to introduce Carolina rice, but have not been generally attended with success. The ruling prices of food-grains, etc., per garce of 9600 lbs. avoirdupois, in South K\u00e1nara in 1870-71 were\u2014for best rice, \u00a333, 14s.; paddy, \u00a314, 10s.; gram, \u00a362, 10s.; and wheat, \u00a362, 10s. The current prices per maund of 82 lbs. of the chief articles of food during 1882-83 were\u2014Rice, 4s. 10\u00bdd.; r\u00e1gi, 3s. 5\u00bdd.; wheat, 7s. 3d.; horse gram (Dolichos uniflorus), 3s. 7\u00bdd.; black gram or m\u00fag (Phaseolus mungo), 5s. 2\u00bdd.; salt, 5s. 8\u00bdd.; sugar, \u00a31, 8s. 4d.\n\nThe wages of day-labourers have not increased since 1850, but smiths and bricklayers, who in that year obtained 6d., now get 9d., and carpenters now receive 1s. who then got 9d. The Holiyars, answering to the Pariahs of Madras and the Mahars of Bombay, are a class who live by hire as unskilled labourers. They are paid in paddy or rice; and their wages are subject to deductions on account of\ndebts generally contracted by them to meet the expenses of marriage. For gathering the harvest and storing it they are not paid at so much per day, but receive one-eleventh of the crop; so also for preparing rice from paddy\u2014they receive 6 lbs. of rice for preparing 84 lbs. At the time of transplanting and reaping, females are largely employed, and are generally paid 4 lbs. of rice per day. Before the British rule, the Holiyars were the slaves of the wargd\u00e1rs (proprietors); and even to this day they remain in a state of modified serfdom. But the coffee estates are drawing large numbers from their homes, and the labour market is rapidly becoming ruled by the ordinary laws of supply and demand.\n\nAlmost all land is private property, some unclaimed waste, and lands escheated to Government being the only exception. The whole is divided into estates (wargs), which include cultivated, cultivable, and waste lands, but only the cultivated portion is assessed. Any new cultivation is assessed at certain fixed rates according to the description of soil. As long as the proprietor pays the assessment, Government does not interfere, and no cultivation accounts are kept, the assessment being fixed on the whole estate and not on each field. Some over-assessed lapsed estates are temporarily granted for cultivation below the standard assessment. Formerly mul-patt\u00e1s (permanent leases) were given for such lands, but the practice has now been discontinued.\n\nThe tenures between the proprietor (wargd\u00e1r) and the tenant (wakkal) are: (1) milgeni or permanent leases at a fixed rent, generally granted on payment of a premium\u2014in old leases the rent is usually paid in money, in recent leases in kind; (2) chalgeni, yearly or temporary leases\u2014rent generally paid in kind, sometimes partly in money and partly in kind. The milgent tenure is transferable, and the holder may be regarded as a subordinate proprietor rather than a tenant. The milgeni tenants are in the proportion of 1 to 6 to the chalgeni tenants. The Government assessment on milgeni lands is sometimes paid by the proprietor and sometimes by the tenant. That on chalgeni lands is always paid by the proprietor. All the best rice land in the District is already under cultivation, but there is a considerable extent of waste within the limits of estates suitable for a single crop of rice. Favourable rates are given for bringing such land under cultivation. The Government assessment is paid to the p\u00e1tel or village head-man in five instalments, and forwarded monthly to the treasury. The following are the average rates of rent per acre paid by the tenants to their landlords:\n\n| On Milgeni | Chalgeni |\n|------------|---------|\n| Byle, or 3 crop land, . . . Rs. 20 to Rs. 26 | Rs. 16 to Rs. 20 |\n| Mazal, or 2 crop land, . . . Rs. 12 ,, Rs. 16 | Rs. 8 ,, Rs. 11 |\n| Bettu, or 1 crop land, . . . Rs. 8 ,, Rs. 11 | Rs. 4 ,, Rs. 6 |\n| Cocoa-nut and areca-nut gardens, Rs. 30 ,, Rs. 40 | Rs. 20 ,, Rs. 30 |\nOut of this the proprietor pays the Government assessment. Rents have considerably increased of late years.\n\nCommunications.\u2014In 1882-83, there were 357 miles of navigable rivers in the District; and of made roads, 1164 miles. No railway passes through the District. The principal lines of road are from Mangalore to the various gh\u00e2ts which lead into Mysore and Coorg. The coast road is not practicable for wheel traffic, but there is excellent sea communication by country craft and steamers.\n\nCommerce, etc.\u2014The chief articles of trade are coffee, rice, salt, coir, yarn, betel-nuts, oil, and seeds. The exports exceed the imports in value very considerably; but this is no evidence of the balance of trade being in favour of this District, as Mangalore and other K\u00e1nara ports are chiefly used to export the produce of the countries above the Gh\u00e2ts, while part of the imports find their way through to other Districts, via Bangalore. The annual tonnage of ships is returned at 291,145, and their number at 3833. The chief articles of import are piece-goods, cotton twist, yarn, oils, and salt. In 1875-76, the total imports were valued at \u00a3183,250, and the exports at \u00a3781,672. Of the exports, \u00a3400,000 represent coffee, and \u00a3175,000 rice; of the imports, the chief item is \u00a3110,000 for piece-goods and yarn. In 1881, the imports into Mangalore, the chief town and port of the District, were valued at \u00a3238,172, and the exports in the same year at \u00a3284,427.\n\nThe Basel Mission and the Jesuit Mission are the most notable institutions in the District. The Basel Mission has a large shop for the sale of European goods, a tile manufactory, a weaving shed, and a flourishing printing establishment, all which give employment to converts.\n\nRevenue History.\u2014In 1800, Major (afterwards Sir Thomas) Munro was appointed Collector of K\u00e1nara. The exactions of Haidar and Tip\u00fa, though resulting in a large nominal increase of revenue, which was never fully collected, had seriously impoverished the country. In order to place the revenue on a satisfactory footing, Major Munro struck off a portion of the Mysore augmentation, and took the original Bedn\u00fbr assessment with part of the Mysore additions as a basis. His object was to fix a limit to the Government demand which would be within the means of the proprietors to pay. Some estates were then unable to pay even this limited demand, and a temporary abatement was made in such cases, to be withdrawn on cultivation improving. It was laid down as a general rule that the assessment on estates, even on the most productive, ought never to be raised higher than it had been at some former period. During the succeeding seventeen years the revenue did not improve, and collections were realized with increasing difficulty. It was considered that the Munro Settlement pressed heavily in some cases, and it was decided therefore to revise it. The Board\nof Revenue were of opinion that the best universal standard would be the average collections from each estate during the preceding seventeen years; and the Harris Settlement, or 'Tarow,' fixed on these principles, has continued to the present day.\n\nDuring the years immediately following the 'Tarow' Settlement, the collections did not in any year attain the standard then fixed; and owing to bad crops, low prices, and other causes, large annual remissions had to be granted. In 1831, the Collector, Mr. Viveash, permanently reduced the assessment on some over-assessed estates, and made arrangements to bring others up to the 'Tarow' by instalments. Since that time no change has been made, and the District has improved rapidly, the assessment being collected with ease and punctuality. The Viveash arrangement has never been formally sanctioned by the Board of Revenue, so that the permanent reductions ('Board shifarras') are liable to be cancelled, and the 'Tarow' Settlement reimposed on any general revision of the assessment on such estates. The amount of such reductions is, however, small (\u00a31003). Lands newly taken up for cultivation are assessed with reference to their capability for producing rice, the staple crop of the District.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1870-71, after North K\u00e1nara had been constituted a separate District, the revenue was \u00a3233,776, and the expenditure \u00a367,729. The principal source of revenue is the land, which yielded \u00a3116,189 in 1871; salt yielded \u00a353,277; excise on spirits and drugs, \u00a313,784. In 1882-83 the land revenue was \u00a3135,804; excise, \u00a314,847; assessed taxes, \u00a31237; stamps, \u00a319,728; miscellaneous, \u00a32518; total gross revenue, \u00a3174,134. The District postal service cost \u00a3323. South K\u00e1nara is divided into the 5 taluks of Mangalore, Kassergod, Upp\u00e1rangadi, Udipi, and Kundapur. The number of magisterial courts in 1882-83 was 22, and of civil and revenue judges, 13. The average distance from a village to the nearest court is 21 miles. The total police force in 1882 numbered 707 men, being 1 to every 5\u00bd square miles and to every 1357 of the population. The total cost of this force was \u00a39954. The average pay of a foot constable is 16s., and of a mounted constable, 20s. per month. There are four printing presses in the District. There were, in 1881, 207 Government and inspected schools, teaching 7828 pupils. Education until late years was more backward than in the eastern Districts, but great strides have been made since the local boards were introduced. Good schooling of a high class is obtainable at the Mangalore provincial school; and more recently the Jesuit Mission has started a college, and is raising a building capable of accommodating 500 boys. The college is managed almost entirely by European teachers.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The District is generally healthy, but fever and bowel complaints are not uncommon. The rainfall averages about 140\ninches per annum; in 1882, the fall was 154.5 inches. The mean temperature on the seaboard is 84\u00b0 F. The prevailing epidemic disease is fever. It is most common during the monsoon (June to October), and is probably due to the excessive damp and the malarial poison developed from decaying vegetation. The agricultural classes, owing to their close proximity to the jungles, are the chief sufferers. In the neighbourhood of the Gh\u00e1ts, jungle fever, enlarged spleens, and debilitated constitutions are more or less common. The only really epidemic disease is small-pox, though in 1876 a mild form of cholera, or more probably bowel complaint, caused many deaths. Small-pox is prevalent during the months of February and March. It is of a severe type, and attacks the poorer classes. The medicines prescribed by the native practitioners are chiefly decoctions, and ointments prepared from herbs, roots, drugs, and spices. They invariably prescribe three things at the same time:\u2014(1) A decoction or a charm to be taken internally, (2) an ointment to be applied externally, and (3) a kanji or rice-water, with several medicines mixed in it to be taken as a diet. The best-known indigenous medicines of this District are\u2014Cannabis indica, Catechu Ingram, Chireta, Datura alba, galls, and sarsaparilla. In 1882\u201383, 25,522 births were registered, or 27.8 per 1000 of the population; and 15,837 deaths, or 17.2 per 1000 of the population. Vaccination is spreading in the District. [For further information regarding South K\u00e1nara, see the Madras Census Report for 1881, and the several Administration and Departmental Reports of the Presidency from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nKan\u00e1rak (Black Pagoda).\u2014Ruined temple in Pur\u00ed District, Orissa; situated on the sea-shore of the Bay of Bengal, 19 miles north-west of Pur\u00ed town. Lat. 19\u00b0 53' 25\" N., long. 86\u00b0 8' 16\" E. This temple forms one of the most exquisite memorials of sun-worship in India\u2014one of the religions of the Vishnuvite type into which Buddhism disintegrated, and which afterwards gave place to another form of Vishnuvism, represented by Jagann\u00e1th. According to the Orissa records, it was built between 1237 and 1282 A.D. It is now a picturesque ruin, looking down upon the sea. No traces of the outer wall remain, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 officers having carried away the stones as building materials to Pur\u00ed; and of the temple itself, which in a complete state would have consisted of four chambers, only a single one, the Hall of Audience, survives. Its great doorway, facing the east, is blocked up by masses of stone and festooned by creepers. In front rises a huge mound of jungle-covered rubbish, the remains of the outer hall of offerings. Sculptures in high relief, but of an indecent character, cover the exterior walls, and bear witness to an age when Hindu artists worked from nature. The nymphs are beautifully-shaped women; the elephants move along at the true elephant trot, and kneel down in the stone exactly as they did\nin life. Clubmen, griffins, warriors on prancing horses, colossal figures of grotesque and varied shape, stand about in silent groups. Each of the four doorways, on the north, south, east, and west, has two lintels of chlorite,\u2014a bluish, slate-like stone, very hard, and exquisitely polished. On these lintels rest massive beams of iron, supporting the wall above. The eastern entrance was, till some years ago, surmounted, as in other Orissa temples, by a chlorite slab, on which the emblems of the seven days of the week, with the ascending and descending nodes, are carved. The beauty of this elaborate piece proved a more fatal enemy than time, and tempted English antiquaries to try to remove it by sea to the Museum at Calcutta. A grant of public money was obtained; but it sufficed only to drag the massive block a couple of hundred yards, where it now lies, quite apart from the temple, and as far as ever from the shore. This block has now been disfigured by red paint applied to convert the relic into a sw\u00e1mi or god, and as such it is now sanctified and worshipped. A pyramid-shaped roof rises by terraces of exquisitely-carved granite, divided into three tiers, to a lotus-crowned pinnacle; the whole covered with sculptures of elephants, horses, cavalry, and foot-soldiers in endless processions. Innumerable busts of nymphs stand out from the mass of carving; images of the four-headed Brahma look towards the sea. If this ungrudging labour was lavished on merely the outer hall of offerings, one may judge of the magnificence of the towered sanctuary, whose ruins now constitute the jungle-covered hill behind. This inner edifice seems to have been never completed, as the foundation of the internal pillars, on which the heavy dome rested, gave way before the outer halls were finished. Its completed size may be inferred from the proportions of other temples belonging to the same order; and a restored elevation of it will be found in Mr. James Fergusson's History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, p. 422, ed. 1876. The enormous pyramidal roof of the still existing outer chamber rests on walls 60 feet high, and rises a further 64 feet above them. It forms a landmark along the coast, which ships still sight on their passage up the Bay of Bengal; and inaccuracy in the bearings or neglect to use the lead constantly wrecked vessels on the shore. The villagers explained such mishaps by a story of a huge lodestone (Kumbh\u00e1r-pathar) on the summit of the tower, which, like Sinbad the sailor's rock, drew the unhappy ships on the sands; and they relate how a Musalm\u00e1n crew at length scaled the temple and carried off the fatal magnet. The priests, they say, forthwith abandoned the desecrated shrine, and migrated with their god to Puri.\n\nKanauj.\u2014Eastern tahsil of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces; lying along the south bank of the Ganges. Area, 209 square miles, of which 135 are cultivated. Population (1872) 117,141; (1881) 114,912, namely, males 61,970, and females 52,942. Classified accord-\ning to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 97,744; Muhammadans, 16,702; and Jains, 466. Land revenue, \u00a320,637; total Government revenue, \u00a323,738; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a335,158. The tahsil may be broadly divided into two tracts,\u2014the uplands (b\u00e1ngar), above the old cliff of the Ganges, and the lowlands (kachaha), about 30 feet below it. The uplands occupy the bulk of the tahsil; and these are again cleft into two natural divisions by the K\u00e1l\u00ed Nadi, which winds across them parallel to the Ganges cliff, and descends through that cliff into the lowlands. The lowland tract, which formed many centuries ago the bed of the Ganges, is still more or less subject to inundation by that river. The principal crops, and the approximate area occupied by them, are\u2014for the autumn harvest, b\u00e1jra, 18,750 acres; jod\u00e1r, 15,000 acres; indigo, 9,250 acres; cotton, 7,250 acres; arhar, 3,250 acres; and moth, 1,250 acres:\u2014for the spring harvest, barley, 50,000 acres; wheat, 28,750 acres; poppy, 5,250 acres; gram, 2,500 acres; and barley mixed with wheat, 1,750 acres. Sugar-cane occupies about 4,250 acres all the year round. The tahsil is well provided with roads for the transport of its produce, and weekly markets are held at all its principal villages. The Grand Trunk Road passes north-westwards through the tahsil, and several unmetalled roads connect the towns and villages. The Cawnpur and Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d Railway, when completed, will cross the tahsil parallel to the Grand Trunk Road, with stations at Mir\u00e1n-ki-Sar\u00e1i, Fatehpur, and Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d. Additional means of communication are also afforded by the Ganges, and in the rains by the K\u00e1l\u00ed Nadi. The principal landed proprietors are B\u00e1ghel R\u00e1jputs, Br\u00e1hmans, and K\u00e1yasths. The tahsil contains one civil and one criminal court, and two police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), with their head-quarters at Mir\u00e1n-ki-Sar\u00e1i and Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d; strength of regular police force, 39 men; village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 322.\n\nKanauj.\u2014Ancient city in Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces; situated on the west bank of the K\u00e1l\u00ed Nadi, 5 miles above its junction with the Ganges and 32 miles south of Fatehgarh, in lat. 27\u00b0 2' 30\" N., and long. 79\u00b0 58' E. The sacred river, which once flowed close beneath the city, has now receded some four miles north-eastward.\n\nKanauj in early times formed the capital of a great Aryan kingdom, and the Gupta dynasty extended their sway over a large portion of Upper India. The prosperity of the city dates from a pre-historic period, and seems to have culminated about the 6th century after Christ. In 1018 it fell before Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed, and again, in 1194, before Muhammad Ghori. In 1540, Hum\u00e1y\u00fan here received his crushing defeat at the hands of Sher Sh\u00e1h, which compelled him for the time to fly from India and renounce the empire of B\u00e1bar. The existing ruins extend over the lands of five villages, and occupy a semicircle fully four miles in diameter. Their material consisted chiefly\nof brick, so that only the foundations of the principal buildings now remain; and as the bricks are constantly employed for fresh edifices, the traces of the ancient city grow scantier every day. The present town covers the ravines and mounds of the cliff which once bordered on the Ganges bed. Among the relics of antiquity, the shrine of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ajaip\u00e1l ranks first in interest, having been erected, in all probability, by the Jaip\u00e1l conquered by Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed, and killed in 1021 by the Chandel R\u00e1j\u00e1 of K\u00e1l\u00ednjar. The Jam\u00e1 Masjid, or Cathedral Mosque, also dates back to Hindu times, its pillars exhibiting traces of early carving, with florid details of sculpture, too idolatrous for the handicraft of Musalm\u00e1n workmen. It still bears the name of S\u00edt\u00e1\u2019s Kitchen (S\u00edt\u00e1-ki-rasoi), and is said to have been converted to its present use by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sh\u00e1h of Jaunpur about 1400. North-west of the town stand the later Muhammadan tombs of B\u00e1l\u00e1 Pir and his son, Shaikh Mehndi, dating from about 1650. Other Musalm\u00e1n mausoleums cover surrounding fields. The present inhabitants live for the most part in huts built up against the ancient walls. Kanauj formed one of the great traditional centres of Aryan civilisation. Hinduism in Lower Bengal dates its legendary origin from a Br\u00e1hman migration southwards from this city, circ. 800 or 900 A.D. To this day all Br\u00e1hmans in the Lower Provinces trace their descent to one or other of the five Br\u00e1hmans from Kanauj.\n\nThe modern town stands on the mounds and slopes carved by ravines. The streets are in most cases, therefore, steep; while the different quarters or wards are marked off by narrow gullies or lanes. Although chiefly brick-built, the town has a shabby appearance, many of the modern houses being built on the ruined sites of the old city, the brickwork foundations of which extend to a great depth. The busiest portion of the town is the Bar\u00e1 B\u00e1z\u00e1r, or High Street, a long, widish, winding road paved with brick. It is entered at its eastern end through an old gateway, which once formed the west portal of a sar\u00e1\u00ed built in the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, but of which a few chambers only remain. Another important business centre is a wide and shady grain market, known as the Tur\u00e1b Al\u00ed B\u00e1z\u00e1r. The population of the town, which in 1871 was 17,093, had slightly decreased by 1881 to 16,646, males numbering 8302, and females 8344. Classified according to religion, there were, in 1881\u2014Hindus, 10,057; Muhammadans, 6123; and Jains, 466. Markets are held four days in the week, for the ordinary sales of grain, vegetables, and cloth. The manufactures of Kanauj comprise the weaving of various descriptions of cloth, the distillation of rose-water, paper-making, lac bracelets, confectionery, etc. For police and conservancy purposes, a house-tax is levied under the provisions of the Chaukid\u00e1ri Act.\n\nKan-aung (Kanoung).\u2014Township with 4 revenue circles, in Henzada\nDistrict, Irawadi Division, British Burma. It extends westwards from the Irawadi to the Arakan Yomas. The tract near the river is low, but now protected from inundations by extensive embankments; towards the hills the country is mountainous, clothed with valuable forests, containing teak, tauk-kyan, pyin-gado, and in (eng). In the low lands between the Irawadi and the hills are several lakes, the chief being the Tu, fed during the rains by the Mamiya, a mountain stream. The principal town is Kan-aung. Population (1876) 36,336; (1881) 27,857; number of villages, 140; land revenue, \u00a32863; revenue from capitation-tax, \u00a32504; from fisheries, \u00a31160; from net-tax, \u00a35; from local cesses, \u00a3418. Area under cultivation (1881\u201382), 16,291 acres, of which 13,886 were under rice, 488 under sesamum, and 63 under tobacco. The agricultural stock in 1881 comprised 3803 buffaloes, 9215 cows, bulls, and bullocks, 485 pigs, 2446 carts, and 1573 ploughs; sledges, 1212; boats, 129.\n\nKan-aung.\u2014Town in Henzada District, Irawadi Division, British Burma; situated on the right bank of the Irawadi. Lat. 18\u00b0 11' 50\" N., long. 95\u00b0 29' E. Population (1881) 3218, chiefly merchants and petty traders; number of houses, 655; revenue, \u00a3232. Kan-aung was founded in 1754 A.D. by King Alompra; the name is Talaing, and means 'whirlpool.' The place is so called because at the time the name was given there was a whirlpool opposite the spot on which the town was built. In the neighbourhood are the remains of an old fort. The town contains a police station, Public Works Department inspection bungalow, and several public rest-houses. The extra-Assistant Commissioner resides and holds his court at Kan-aung.\n\nK\u00e1nchanjang\u00e1 (Kinchinjunga).\u2014An immense mountain peak in the Eastern Him\u00e1layas, on the boundary between Sikkim and Nep\u00e1l. Lat. 27\u00b0 42' 5\" N., long. 88\u00b0 11' 26\" E. The second loftiest measured mountain in the world; elevation, 28,176 feet. This peak is 130 miles east of Gosainthan, and forms the extreme eastern horn of the Nep\u00e1l Him\u00e1layas.\n\nK\u00e1nchanjhau.\u2014A lofty spur of the Him\u00e1layas, forming the northern boundary line of Sikkim.\n\nK\u00e1ncharap\u00e1ra.\u2014Village and station on the Eastern Bengal Railway, on the northern boundary of the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal; 28 miles from Calcutta.\n\nKanchiang.\u2014River in the Kh\u00e1si Hills, Assam, which flows south into Sylhet District, and ultimately joins the main stream of the Surm\u00e1 or Bar\u00e1k under the name of the J\u00e1duk\u00e1t\u00e1.\n\nK\u00e1nch\u00edvaram (K\u00e1nchip\u00far).\u2014Town in Chengalpat District, Madras Presidency.\u2014See Conjeveram.\n\nKandah\u00e1r.\u2014Province in Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n. The Province of Kandah\u00e1r extends on the K\u00e1bul side to Pul-i-Sang, about 10 miles south of\nKhel\u00e1t-i-Ghilzai; on the west to the Helmand; on the south to the frontier of Baluchist\u00e1n; and on the north to the Haz\u00e1ra country. Kandah\u00e1r became a separate government twenty years ago (about 1860). The chief rivers in the Province are the Helmand, the Tarnak, the Argand\u00e1b, the Dor\u00ed, the Arghast\u00e1n, and Kadan\u00e1i. The principal mountain range is the Sh\u00e1h Maks\u00fad, which divides the Khakrez valley from that of Ghorak. The highest point of the range is 8840 feet. Other ranges in the Province are the Gul Koh, forming the right-hand boundary of the Tarnak valley, the Khakrez range, dividing the Khakrez valley from the valley of the Argand\u00e1b, and the G\u00e1nt\u00e9 mountains, on the left bank of the Arghast\u00e1n river. The Dur\u00e1n\u00ed tribe forms the largest part of the population. Farziwans (Persians) and Ghilzais are also found in considerable numbers.\n\nThe most important towns in the Province are Kandah\u00e1r, Farah, Khel\u00e1t-i-Ghilzai, and M\u00e1ruf. An approximate estimate by one of Sher Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n\u2019s ministers gives the following details of population:\u2014Men, 400,000; women, 600,000; children, 600,000; total, 1,600,000. The same authority estimates the revenue of the Province at about Rs. 3,700,000, or \u00a3370,000.\n\n**Kandah\u00e1r** *(Candahar).*\u2014Chief city of the Province of Kandah\u00e1r, Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n; situated in lat. 31\u00b0 37' N., and long. 65\u00b0 30' E., between the Argand\u00e1b and Tarnak rivers, 89 miles south-west of Khel\u00e1t-i-Ghilzai, 233 miles south-west of Ghazn\u00ed, 318 south-west of K\u00e1bul, and 380 south-east of Her\u00e1t.\n\nThe modern city of Kandah\u00e1r is situated in a plain on the left bank of the Argand\u00e1b, but separated from that river by a range of mountains. A break in the continuity of the latter affords easy communication between the plain of Kandah\u00e1r and the valley of the Argand\u00e1b. Old Kandah\u00e1r was built at the base of the Chehlz\u00ednak rock, four miles west of the modern city, enclosing with three main fronts a considerable portion of plain, whilst the fourth front was formed by the mountain. This rock, from its singular form and precipitous sides, was considered inaccessible and a more secure barrier than the artificial works at its base. N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h, who, after a long siege, captured old Kandah\u00e1r, showed the weakness of the site; and this probably led to a city being built two miles south-east, in the plains and clear of all hills, named N\u00e1dir\u00e1b\u00e1d, which in its turn was destroyed by Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Abd\u00e1l\u00ed, who in 1747 founded the present city. The remains of old Kandah\u00e1r are on a much larger scale and have a more formidable appearance than any of the later military strongholds of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n. The following account of the city is condensed from General Sir Charles Macgregor\u2019s *Gazetteer*; but no responsibility rests with the Government of India for any facts or opinions here offered.\n\nThe population of the city of Kandah\u00e1r has been very variously,\nestimated: Elphinstone gives 100,000, Hough 80,000, Masson 25,000 to 30,000, Ferrier 30,000, Court 25,000, and Bellew 15,500. But these great discrepancies may be reconciled by supposing that the population increases and diminishes according as the Government is protective or oppressive. Kandah\u00e1r is probably capable of holding from 50,000 to 80,000 inhabitants. Ferrier states that one-fourth of the population are B\u00e1rakz\u00e1s\u00eds, one-eighth Ghilzais, one-eighth various Dur\u00e1ni tribes, and one-half Pars\u00edw\u00e1ns and Hindus; and that there are no Jews or Armenians in the city. The city is situated on a level plain covered with cultivation. On the south and east are detached hills, on the north and west a low ridge. Its shape is an irregular oblong, the greatest length being from north to south, with a circuit of 3 miles 1006 yards. It is surrounded by a ditch 24 feet wide and 10 feet deep, and by a wall which is 20\u00bd feet thick at the bottom, 14\u00bd feet thick at the top, and 27 feet in height. This wall is made of mud hardened by exposure to the sun, without revetment of stone or brick. The length of the west face is 1967 yards, of the east 1810, of the south 1345, and of the north 1164. There are six gates, viz. the Bard\u00far\u00e1n\u00ed and K\u00e1b\u00fal on the east face, the Shik\u00e1rpur on the south, the Her\u00e1t and Topkh\u00e1na on the west, and the \u2019Idgah on the north. The gateways are defended by six double bastions, and the angles are protected by four large circular towers. The curtains between the bastions have 54 small bastions distributed along the faces. From the Her\u00e1t gate a street runs through the city to the K\u00e1b\u00fal gate; and another commencing from the Shik\u00e1rpur gate leads to the citadel, crossing it at right angles near the centre. At the point of their intersection is a large dome 50 yards in diameter, called the Ch\u00e1rs\u00fa. These four principal streets are about 40 yards wide, and are lined with shops and houses. They are named after the gates to which they respectively lead from the Ch\u00e1rs\u00fa, except in the case of the street leading to the citadel, which is named the Sh\u00e1h\u00ed b\u00e1z\u00e1r. This street is very narrow both at its south and north entrances, and leads first into an open space in front of the citadel, having the Nik\u00e1ra Kh\u00e1na on its west. There are smaller and narrower streets, which run from the principal ones towards the city walls (all crossing each other at right angles), between which and the houses there is a road about 25 yards wide all round the city. The houses generally are built of sun-dried bricks and are flat-roofed; some have upper storeys. The houses of the rich are enclosed by high walls, and contain three or four courts with gardens and fountains. Each court contains a building with several small apartments, and three or four halls reaching to the roof, supported by wooden pillars, carved and painted. The apartments open on the halls, and are filled up with paintings on the walls, and looking-glasses let into the recesses. There are some buildings with roofs formed\nwith flat-arched domes, made of sun-burnt bricks, with a hole at the top in the centre to admit the light. These houses are to be seen chiefly in the suburbs outside the city, in ranges, containing several together; they have on one side doors, but no windows or regular fire-places. The citadel is situated at the north of the city. South of it is an open space called the Topkh\u00e1na, which affords a place of arms; west of it is an open face, in which is situated the tomb of Ahm\u00e1d Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1n\u00ed, an octagonal structure overlaid outside with coloured porcelain bricks, and surmounted by a gilded dome surrounded by small minarets. It overtops all the surrounding buildings, and its dome attracts the attention of the traveller approaching the city. The pavement within is covered with a carpet, and a shawl is thrown over the sarcophagus of the monarch. The sepulchre itself is composed of a fine stone found in the mountains near Kandah\u00e1r, inlaid with wreaths of flowers of coloured marble. Twelve lesser tombs, of the children of the Abd\u00e1l\u00ed, are ranged near. The interior walls are painted in devices, similar to those which adorn the exterior, but the execution is more regular, and the colours, having been less exposed, are fresher and more brilliant. The lofty dome above the centre imparts an air of grandeur to the little building, and its window of trellis-work in stone admit a solemn and pleasing light.\n\nThe trade between Kandah\u00e1r and Her\u00e1t and Mashad is carried on principally by Persians, who bring down silk (raw and manufactured), copper utensils, guns, daggers, swords, precious stones (turquoise), brocade, gold and silver braiding, ducats, horses, kurks, carpets, etc., and take back wool, felts, postins, and skins of the fox, wolf, etc. Till 1830 the trade was considerable, and also during the British occupation; but after the return of Kohan Dil Kh\u00e1n in 1843, his tyranny drove away the principal merchants. The principal manufactures of Kandah\u00e1r are silks, felts for coats, and rosaries of a soft crystallized silicate of magnesia, found near the city. The vine is very extensively cultivated in the suburban gardens of Kandah\u00e1r, which produce no less than 19 different kinds of grapes. The b\u00e1z\u00e1rs are well supplied with good and cheap provisions, and excellent fruit is abundant,\u2014apricots, pomegranates, quinces, figs, plums, peaches, cherries, apples, mulberries, etc. Dried fruit forms the great staple of the place.\n\nHistory.\u2014From the remotest times, Kandah\u00e1r must have been a town of much importance in Asia, as its geographical position sufficiently indicates, it being the central point at which the roads from Her\u00e1t, Seist\u00e1n, Ghor, India, and K\u00e1b\u00fal unite, and the commercial mart of these localities. Kandah\u00e1r is supposed to have been one of the seven cities built in the interior of Asia by Alexander the Great, on the ground that K\u00e1ndar or Kandah\u00e1r is an abbreviation of the name\nIskandar (Sikandar or Alexander). From the hands of Alexander, Kandah\u00e1r is supposed to have passed into the power of the Seleukides, whose history is involved in obscurity. It is scarcely possible to determine what its condition was under the dominion of the Parthians and Sassanides, for the history of Kandah\u00e1r at that time is enveloped in darkness, which lasted nearly to the period when the successors of Muhammad invaded Persia; but it appears certain that the Arabs penetrated into it in the first age of the Hijira. In A.D. 865, Y\u00e1kub-ben Leis, founder of the dynasty of the Soffarides, possessed himself of Kandah\u00e1r; the Sassanides drove out his successors, and it was taken from them by the famous Mahm\u00fad Ghaznav\u00ed, whose dynasty was overthrown by that of the Ghorides. Under these last, Kandah\u00e1r fell by turns into the hands of petty ambitious chiefs, who all succumbed to the 'Seljukides.' These possessed it till Sanjar, a prince of that dynasty, was overthrown by the T\u00farkom\u00e1ns, who were established in the town in 1153. A few years after, it fell under the power of Ghi\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn Muhammad, a Ghoride prince. Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Muhammad, Sult\u00e1n of Khaurism, took it in 1210; and his son was dispossessed by the famous Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr Kh\u00e1n in 1222. The descendants of that conqueror allowed it to be wrenched from them by the prince of the dynasty of Malek-kurt, who were succeeded by local chieftains till the period at which Tim\u00farlane invaded and took possession of it (1389); at his death it became part of the dominions of his son, Sh\u00e1h-Rokh. The Timurides retained it till 1468, at which epoch the death of the Sult\u00e1n Ab\u00fa Sayyid caused the dismemberment of the Empire. After this time, Kandah\u00e1r and some surrounding Districts formed an independent State. In 1512 it was in the power of a chief called Sh\u00e1h Beg, who was dispossessed by the famous B\u00e1bar, founder of the dynasty of the Mughals in India, to whose dominions it was annexed. Not long afterwards, Kandah\u00e1r was taken by the Persians; and, after falling into the hands of the Mughals (from whom the Persians regained it in 1620), it was seized by the Uzbeks, who were not driven out till 1634. It again changed hands from time to time, and during the last 150 years has figured conspicuously in history. In 1737, Nadir Sh\u00e1h, with an army of 100,000 men, blockaded the place for 18 months. It was then stormed, and after a gallant resistance the commandant surrendered. In 1834, Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1 marched against Kandah\u00e1r with 22,000 men, but was compelled, after a desperate series of struggles lasting 54 days, to retire. This was the last unaided attempt of the Sadozais to re-take Kandah\u00e1r; the next time Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1 appeared on the field, it was with the support of the British Government.\n\nThe army of the Indus took possession of Kandah\u00e1r on the 20th April 1839, without any resistance; and Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1 was crowned in the mosque of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h on the 8th May. On the march of the\narmy to Ghazn\u00ed and K\u00e1b\u00fal, to restore Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1 to the throne of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, a force of three batteries of artillery, and two regiments of infantry and a regiment of cavalry was left behind. This was afterwards increased, and General Nott arrived to take command in November 1839. Throughout 1840 and most of 1841, affairs remained quiet at Kandah\u00e1r, thanks to the good management of Rawlinson and Nott. But in September of the latter year, the first signs of the coming storm were visible in the stoppage of communication between Kandah\u00e1r and Ghazn\u00ed. No attempt, however, was made to lay siege to Kandah\u00e1r by the rebel Dur\u00e1n\u00eds. An army of them under Safdar Jang, Sadozai, hovered about in the vicinity, plundering the villages, and by every possible means urging the inhabitants to join in an attack on the British troops. In the beginning of March 1842, he commenced to approach closer to the city itself; and General Nott moved out to meet him, leaving 2600 men in the city. He signally defeated Safdar Jang; but in his absence an attempt was made to carry the place by a night assault. During the forenoon of the 10th March 1842, bodies of the enemy, horse and foot, were observed assembling from all quarters, taking up a position near old Kandah\u00e1r and the adjoining villages; and in the course of the day their number rapidly increased, parties from the main body moving round and establishing themselves in front of the Shik\u00e1rpur gate. As their object was evidently to attack the garrison, the Political Agent directed the inhabitants to shut their shops and remain within their houses, and precautions were taken to secure the gates by piling bags of grain inside. About 8 o'clock p.m., a desperate attack was made upon the Her\u00e1t gate, and, owing to the darkness of the night, some combustibles were placed near it and ignited unperceived, and in a few minutes the gate was in flames. A party of 100 rank and file from the 2nd Regiment, and a company from the Sh\u00e1h's 1st Infantry, were immediately ordered to support the guard at the gate, and two guns were also placed in position commanding the entrance. Dense masses of the enemy now collected at this point, keeping up an incessant and heavy fire, which was returned with great effect from the ramparts; but so reckless and daring were the assailants, that notwithstanding the fearful havoc among them, eight or ten men actually forced their way by tearing down the burning fragments of the gate, and scrambling over the bags of grain. These were instantly shot, and their fate, together with the galling fire from the walls, dismayed the attacking party, who retired about midnight after four hours' resolute fighting. Another attack took place at the Shik\u00e1rpur gate about 9 p.m., and a similar attempt was made to fire it, which, however, failed, and the assailants were driven back. A small party also approached the K\u00e1b\u00fal gate, but the garrison being everywhere on the\nalert, the enemy were compelled to retire about 1 A.M. of the 11th, and when the day broke not a soul was visible. After this, a force was moved under Colonel Wymer to the relief of the brave garrison of Khel\u00e1t-i-Ghilzai, on which, thinking that the diminution thus caused gave them another opportunity of attacking Kandah\u00e1r, the Dur\u00e1n\u00ed rebels, 6000 strong, under Safdar Jang and Akbar Kh\u00e1n, moved down close to Kandah\u00e1r, and took possession of some steep, rocky hills within a mile of the city walls. Their position was good, and some of their points strong, but they had no reserve, and were somewhat scattered. General Nott sent the 42nd and 43rd Regiments Native Infantry with 4 guns, under Colonel Stacey, to reconnoitre, followed by Her Majesty\u2019s 41st, with artillery. At one o\u2019clock the force was in action. The Dur\u00e1n\u00eds crowned the rocks above the city, and on them our force marched, the light companies as a storming party, supported by the 43rd and the artillery, who kept up a continual fire. From the position of the enemy, and the character of the ground, some loss followed,\u2014about 30 killed and wounded, including 7 or 8 Europeans. After this, the hills on the opposite side were covered by large masses of the Dur\u00e1n\u00eds, who, however, soon gave way, and in great disorder all fled, striving to gain the B\u00e1b\u00e1 W\u00e1li Pass. A horrible scene ensued here. Thinking to entrap the British troops, the Gh\u00e1z\u00eds had barricaded the pass, and the Dur\u00e1n\u00eds, horse and foot, unable to make way, rushed round the base of the hills. Chase was given by Lieutenant Chamberlain with the cavalry and artillery. The Dur\u00e1n\u00eds were driven completely from their position, and fled to their camp beyond the Argand\u00e1b. No other attempt was made against Kandah\u00e1r during General Nott\u2019s time; and on the 8th August 1843, he evacuated the city on his march to K\u00e1bul, taking with him Tim\u00far Mirza, who had been appointed by his father, Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1, Governor of Kandah\u00e1r, and whom he had in vain endeavoured to induce to remain.\n\nSafdar Jang then took possession, but in four months he was driven out by Kohan D\u00edl Kh\u00e1n, who returned from Persia. This chief commenced a reign of gross tyranny, which reduced the inhabitants of Kandah\u00e1r to the last ebb of despair\u2014from which they were only relieved by his death in 1855. His son, Muhammad Sad\u00edk, then coming to Kandah\u00e1r, seized the property and valuables of his deceased father, which proceeding giving great offence to his uncle Rahim D\u00edl Kh\u00e1n, that chief invited the interference of Dost Muhammad, who accordingly arrived and took possession of the city in November 1855, apparently without opposition, and appointed his son, Ghul\u00e1m Haidar Kh\u00e1n, governor. This chief was still governor when Lumsden\u2019s mission arrived in 1857, but he died soon after its withdrawal. Sher Ali Kh\u00e1n appears to have succeeded Ghul\u00e1m Haidar Kh\u00e1n as governor of Kandah\u00e1r, and on his becoming Am\u00edr, his full brother, Muhammad\nAm\u00edn Kh\u00e1n, was appointed in his stead. This chief, however, joined the rebellion against Sher Ali, and was killed in the battle of Kajbaz on the 6th June 1865, where he had advanced to meet him. His brother, Muhammad Shar\u00edf, fled to Kandah\u00e1r, and after a vain attempt to raise partisans, surrendered to the Amir Sher Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, who consequently, on the 14th June 1865, took possession of Kandah\u00e1r. Upon the defeat of Sher Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n at Khel\u00e1t-i-Ghilzai on the 17th of January 1867, Kandah\u00e1r passed from his grasp to that of Az\u00edm Kh\u00e1n, his half-brother and rival. But after the battle on the Helmand on the 1st April 1868, Kandah\u00e1r again fell into the power of Sher Al\u00ed through his son, Y\u00e1kub Kh\u00e1n.\n\nOn the outbreak of hostilities between England and Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n in November 1878, a column advanced upon Kandah\u00e1r from Quetta under General Sir Donald Stewart. A body of the enemy was encountered and completely routed at Saif-ud-d\u00edn in the Takht-i-Pul district, and Kandah\u00e1r was occupied on the 8th January 1879 without further opposition.\n\nAfter the death of the Amir Sher Al\u00ed and the arrival of his successor Y\u00e1kub Kh\u00e1n in the British camp at Gandamak had brought the war to an end, the British troops were withdrawn from most of the stations beyond the boundary which was fixed by the Gandamak treaty of May 1879; but for sanitary reasons the evacuation of Kandah\u00e1r was postponed until the autumn. The Kandah\u00e1r force had only begun to move, in accordance with this agreement, to the Pishin district, when it was ordered back on receipt of the news of the massacre of Sir Louis Cavagnari and his escort at K\u00e1b\u00fal on the 3rd September 1879. Kandah\u00e1r was then re-occupied, and demonstrations were made from it towards Ghazn\u00ed and Khel\u00e1t-i-Ghilzai, the latter place being occupied, and a garrison left in it in the following month.\n\nLater, when in March 1880 Sir D. Stewart marched from Kandah\u00e1r to return to India by way of Ghazn\u00ed and K\u00e1b\u00fal with the troops under his command which had been originally drawn from Bengal, fresh troops were moved up from Bombay to replace the Bengal division; and Major-General Primrose, who arrived on the 11th of April, took command.\n\nSard\u00e1r Sher Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, Governor of Kandah\u00e1r, was formally installed as W\u00e1li of the Province on the 11th of May. Shortly after this, news was received that Sard\u00e1r Muhammad Ay\u00fab Kh\u00e1n was about to advance on Kandah\u00e1r, whereupon the W\u00e1li marched in June with his own troops towards the Helmand to keep the country quiet, and early in July a brigade of British troops under Brigadier-General Burrows was sent in support to the left bank of the river. The W\u00e1li's infantry and artillery mutinied on the 15th July, and moved off towards Z\u00e1mind\u00e1war. After the mutineers had been pursued and their guns had been taken\nfrom them, General Burrows retired upon Kh\u00fashk-i-Nakhud, a point about midway between Kandah\u00e1r and Girishk, where he awaited Ay\u00fab Kh\u00e1n\u2019s approach. Ay\u00fab\u2019s advance guard reached Maiwand, 10 miles north-east of the British camp, on the 26th July, and the following day General Burrows marched to attack him. The battle which followed ended in a disastrous defeat for the British troops, who were very greatly outnumbered. General Burrows\u2019 brigade was dispersed, losing heavily, and the road to Kandah\u00e1r lay open to Ay\u00fab Kh\u00e1n.\n\nThe survivors of this engagement having reached Kandah\u00e1r, General Primrose withdrew from the cantonments, and concentrated his force in the citadel and town, where he awaited Ay\u00fab\u2019s attack. From the 8th of August the place was closely invested.\n\nAbdur Rahman Kh\u00e1n had in the meanwhile come to terms with the British Government, and had in July been recognised as Amir of K\u00e1b\u00fal. Orders had also been issued for the withdrawal of the army of occupation from northern Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n. When the news of the Maiwand disaster was received, the Government did not consider that this event necessitated a reversal of the policy of evacuation. But a selected force was taken from the troops at K\u00e1b\u00fal and despatched under the command of Sir Frederick Roberts for the relief of Kandah\u00e1r. This force, amounting to 274 officers, 2562 British and 7151 Native troops, with 18 guns, left K\u00e1b\u00fal on the 8th August, and reached Kandah\u00e1r on the 31st, having traversed 320 miles in 22 days. Sir Frederick Roberts at once assumed the command of the whole of the troops at Kandah\u00e1r, and after a reconnaissance, he determined to attack the enemy on the following morning.\n\nSard\u00e1r Muhammad Ay\u00fab Kh\u00e1n\u2019s position extended from the B\u00e1b\u00e1 W\u00e1li Kotal, or pass, on the left, along and behind the B\u00e1b\u00e1 W\u00e1li ridge, to the village of Mula Sahibdad and Gund\u00edgan on the right. These villages and others in the plain are imbedded in walled gardens and orchards, intersected by numerous canals and watercuts. Neither of the villages, however, was occupied by the enemy on the afternoon of the 31st August, although Pir Paimal, behind the ridge, was held in force. The Afgh\u00e1n camps were in rear of the B\u00e1b\u00e1 W\u00e1li Kotal, between it and the river; Ay\u00fab\u2019s head-quarters being near the village of Mazra, about a mile and a half north of the Kotal. The Kotal itself was strongly held, and several rifled guns placed in position to sweep the open ground in front. It was evident that the enemy expected the main attack to be made at this point. General Roberts, however, was satisfied that any attempt to carry the B\u00e1b\u00e1 W\u00e1li Kotal by a direct attack would be attended with a heavy loss. He determined, therefore, merely to threaten the Kotal, and to attack in force by the village of Pir Paimal and the enemy\u2019s right.\n\nFrom a very early hour next morning it was clear that the enemy\ncontemplated an offensive movement. The village of Gundigan and that known as Gandi Mula Sahibdad, both in advance of the enemy's original position, as ascertained by the reconnaissance of the previous afternoon, were now held in strength, and the enemy opened a desultory fire from the mass of orchards lying around and between them before the troops began to advance. The guns of the B\u00e1b\u00e1 W\u00e1li Kotal also commenced an ill-directed shell fire, which was continued for hours, but with little effect.\n\nAt 9.30 A.M. fire was opened by the British on the B\u00e1b\u00e1 W\u00e1li position and on the village of Gandi Mula Sahibdad from either side of the Kurez Hill. Shortly afterwards the infantry were ordered to advance. The 1st brigade under Brigadier-General Macpherson was directed against Gandi Mula Sahibdad. The 2nd brigade, on the left of the 1st, was ordered to advance in a westerly direction, keeping touch on the right with the 1st brigade, and clearing the network of gardens and orchards in its immediate front. These two brigades were commanded by Major-General Ross.\n\nGandi Mula Sahibdad, the immediate objective, was stoutly defended; but the Highlanders and G\u00farkhas vied with each other in their eagerness to close with the enemy. The village was carried, although a number of the enemy fought to the last, and were killed or driven out at the point of the bayonet. The remainder retreated slowly, keeping up a heavy and deliberate fire. Pir Paimal itself was carried soon after mid-day, and the complete rout of the enemy was effected by driving the last of them from the entrenched position on the south-west of the B\u00e1b\u00e1 W\u00e1li Kotal, where their final stand was made.\n\nThe enemy's losses were computed at 1200 killed, besides many wounded. Upwards of 600 bodies were afterwards buried between Kandah\u00e1r and Pir Paimal alone. Ay\u00fab Kh\u00e1n lost the whole of his camp, baggage, and artillery. The latter amounted to 34 pieces. The total casualties on the British side amounted to 40 killed and 228 wounded, also 16 horses and 7 mules killed, and 17 horses and 5 mules wounded. Twelve of the wounded died of their injuries within a few days of the action.\n\nGeneral Roberts' victory had the immediate effect of quieting the country. General Phayre, who had been advancing from Quetta under great difficulties of supply and transport, reached Abdur Rahman, two marches from Kandah\u00e1r, on the 5th September. The troops which had arrived from K\u00e1b\u00fal were now ordered to India, and General Roberts made over command of the force in South Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n to General Phayre on the 15th October, and left the country. It was not, however, until the end of April 1881 that all the troops in Kandah\u00e1r had been brought back within the limits of the Quetta military division.\nAm\u00edr Abdur Rahman Kh\u00e1n sent Sard\u00e1r Muhammad Hashim Kh\u00e1n, a lad of 19 years, to assume the Governorship of Kandah\u00e1r on its evacuation by the British. Sard\u00e1r Shamsud-din-Kh\u00e1n was sent as adviser to the young Sard\u00e1r.\n\nMeanwhile Ay\u00fab Kh\u00e1n, after his defeat by Sir F. Roberts on 1st September 1880, had maintained himself in Her\u00e1t. He had quelled an insurrection of the Jamshidis, and had seized and put to death their leader, his own father-in-law; and now, the British having withdrawn from Kandah\u00e1r, he meditated another blow for the throne of Afghanistan. During the months of April and May he was busy distributing inflammatory letters among the people and chiefs of Z\u00e1minid\u00e1war, and announced his intended advance on Kandah\u00e1r. On the 3rd June, the old fort at Girishk was seized by one of his generals, Muhammad Hasan Kh\u00e1n. Ay\u00fab Kh\u00e1n completely defeated the Am\u00edr\u2019s troops, a few days later, at At\u00e1 Karez, and on the 27th July he occupied the city of Kandah\u00e1r.\n\nAm\u00edr Abdur Rahman Kh\u00e1n, who up to this time had shown some want of spirit, and whose cause was very generally considered as lost, now fully redeemed his former credit as a soldier. He executed a march from K\u00e1b\u00fal to Kandah\u00e1r with most creditable celerity, and on the 22nd September 1881 he defeated Ay\u00fab close to the site of old Kandah\u00e1r, taking all his guns and equipage. Sard\u00e1r Ay\u00fab Kh\u00e1n again fled in the direction of Her\u00e1t, but that city was occupied by Sard\u00e1r Abdul K\u00fad\u00fas Kh\u00e1n, a lieutenant of the Am\u00edr. Eventually Ay\u00fab Kh\u00e1n took refuge in Persia, where he is at present a refugee.\n\nSince these events, Kandah\u00e1r and the neighbouring country have remained quiet. About 7000 regular troops are quartered there under General Ghul\u00e1m Haidar Kh\u00e1n. The civil Governor is Sard\u00e1r N\u00far Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, who has been in Kandah\u00e1r since November 1882.\n\n**Kand\u00e1pur.**\u2014T\u00e1luk or Sub-division of South K\u00e1nara District, Madras Presidency.

Population (1871) 2545; (1881) 2815. Hindus number 2180; Muhammadans, 399; Christians, 235; and \u2018others,\u2019 1. Number of houses, 540. Formerly one of the principal ports of the Bedn\u00far R\u00e1j, after the disruption of the Vijayangar kingdom. In the 16th century, the Portuguese settled here and built a fort (which still exists a little\ninland from the village), and a strong, well-built redoubt on the sea-face, commanding the entrance to the river. On this redoubt now stands the Head Assistant Collector's office and residence. It was from Kand\u00e1pur that General Matthews started on his march against Bedn\u00far. After being for a quarter of a century under Mysore, the town fell to the British in 1799, and was included in the District of K\u00e1nara. On the partition of that District in 1860, this part of it was temporarily attached to Bombay. The town is healthy, but its trade is languishing.\n\n**Kandarkha Khurd.**\u2014Town in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) District, Oudh; situated on the river Madha, 14 miles from Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d town. Population (1881) 2380, namely, Hindus, 2216; and Muhammadans, 164. Founded and called after a Bisen chief named Khandar Sen about 500 years ago.\n\n**Kandeli** (*Kandili*).\u2014Town in Narsinghpur *tahs\u00edl*, Narsingpur District, Central Provinces; situated one mile east from Narsinghpur town, from which it is separated by the Singri *n\u00e1l\u00e1*. The Government District offices are situated in Kandeli, and most of the officials live here. Under the Gonds and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Kandeli was a little village in the Sh\u00e1hpur Sub-division, where the subordinate governor resided. Railway station one mile east of the town on the Great Indian Peninsula line from Jabalpur to Bombay. Seat of a small manufacture of cotton cloth.\n\n**K\u00e1ndhla.**\u2014Town and municipality in Budh\u00e1na *tahs\u00edl*, Muzaffarnagar District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 29\u00b0 18' 20\" N., long. 77\u00b0 19' 5\" E. Situated on low ground, a little west of the Eastern Jumna Canal, 33 miles south-west of Muzaffarnagar town. Population (1872) 11,026; (1881) 11,109, namely, Hindus, 5221; Muhammadans, 5095; and Jains, 793. Area of town site, 143 acres. Agricultural town, with small local trade. Manufacture of saltpetre. Police station and post-office.

The country consists of a broken plateau, intersected by ridges of low hills, the last refuge of the aboriginal Kandh (Khond) race. The villages are few in number, and divided from each other by rugged peaks and dense forests; but a regular system of government on the aboriginal plan is maintained, the hamlets being distributed into *mutas*, each *muta* being under the supervision of its own chief. Throughout this wild tract, the Kandhs claim an indefeasible right in the soil. They assert that the whole of Bod and also the neighbouring country was once theirs, and that they have been gradually pushed back into the recesses of the hills by unscrupulous invaders. At any rate, the Kandh-m\u00e1ls were never more than nominally subject to the Bod R\u00e1j\u00e1, who was totally unable to control\nor coerce them. After the British Government discovered the frequency of human sacrifice among the Kandhs, an Agency was established to put a stop to the practice (Act xxi. of 1845); and the Bod R\u00e1j\u00e1 gladly ceded the Kandh-m\u00e1ls to us for the better suppression of these inhuman rites. The people are a wild, impulsive race; but the Commissioner of Orissa reports that for years they have lived peaceably under our rule. They pay no rent, and we take no revenue whatever from them, but merely keep order and prevent oppression by means of a tahsild\u00e1r, supported by a strong force of police. This officer's principal duties are to prevent, or put a stop to, blood-feuds, to adjust dangerous disputes, and to take cognisance of any serious crime. The Bod R\u00e1j\u00e1 now exercises no authority in the Kandh-m\u00e1ls.\n\nThe tract contains 885 villages or hamlets, and a total population in 1881 of 58,959 persons. Classified according to religion,\u2014Hindus, 21,936, or 37\u00b78 per cent.; Muhammadans, 4; Christian, 1; aboriginal tribes, 37,018, or 68\u00b72 per cent.; total, 58,959, namely, 30,931 males and 28,928 females. Proportion of males in total population, 51\u00b73 per cent. The most valuable agricultural product is turmeric, of an unusually fine quality, which is bought up by traders from the plains. The Kandhs manifest a remarkable growing inclination towards education. The Commissioner recently reported that 'these people have submitted of their own wish, and indeed of their own motion, to a tax on liquor-shops, the proceeds of which are devoted to the establishment of schools. The tax has been realized without difficulty, and a number of schools have been opened. The school-houses have been built and are maintained by the people themselves.' Charitable dispensary at Bisp\u00e1r\u00e1. A fuller account of the interesting tribe inhabiting this tract will be found in the following article.\n\n**Kandhs** ('the Hill-men').\u2014Variously spelt Kondhs, Khonds, Khands, and Khandhs. An important aboriginal tribe, whose principal habitat now lies in the Tributary States of Orissa, the Eastern Districts or States of the Central Provinces, and the northern hill Districts of Madras. Recent investigations have shown that the Kandhs are in some Districts merging into the Hindu low castes; and their numbers, as stated by the Census officers, are admitted to be underestimated from this cause. The most trustworthy enumerations of the race were conducted, for the Orissa section of the tribe in 1872, and for the sections lying within the Central Provinces and Madras in 1881. They exhibit the following results:\n\n| Kandhs in the Madras Presidency, 1881 | 205,045 |\n|--------------------------------------|---------|\n| Kandhs in the Central Provinces, 1881 | 147,768 |\n| Kandhs in Orissa, 1872                | 77,192  |\n| **Total**                             | **430,005** |\nThe tribe is one of a group of non-Aryan races\u2014the Kandhs, the Kols, and the Savars\u2014who still preserve the general geographical position to each other which they occupied 1500 years ago. The Suari of Pliny are the Sabar\u00e6 of Ptolemy, or the Savars of the present day, and their country is said to begin where that of the Kandhs ends. The Hindu settlers have during many centuries encroached upon the primitive territories of each of the non-Aryan tribes; and the Kandhs who appear on the Orissa delta as landless day-labourers, the clearers of jungle for the superior Hindu race, survive in the mountainous background as a distinct nationality, with a history, a religion, and a system of law and landed property of their own. Indeed, one section of the Kandhs was completely broken up and merged into the low castes of the Aryan or Hindu communities at the foot of the hills. Another section stood its ground more firmly, and became a peasant militia, holding grants of land from the Hindu chiefs in return for military service. A third section fell back into the fastnesses of the mountains, and was recognised as a wild but free race. This fairly describes the present condition of the Kandhs in Orissa, in the northern Districts of Madras, and in the mountainous region which shuts out both these seaboard tracts from the Central Provinces.\n\nIn seven eastern States or Districts of the Central Provinces, the Kandhs are described as a recognised agricultural class; and it is to the ruder sections of the race, which still maintain a distinct tribal existence in the intermediate mountainous region, that the following description applies.\n\nThe Kandhs are regarded by Bishop Caldwell as allied to the Gonds, and are said to call themselves in certain tracts by the name of Kus. Some consider Kandh or Khond a kindred word with Gond, and derive both names from the Tamil Kundru, literally a small hill, which in Telugu takes the form of Konda. Mr. Latchmaji, the author of the grammar of their language, gives their own tribal name as Kus: a word evidently allied to K\u00f6i, by which the Gonds also call themselves.\n\nWhen questioned as to their origin, some of the Kandh tribes declare that they were driven westwards from the low country of Orissa, others that they have been pushed eastwards from Central India. The two legends alike point to advancing waves of Hindu colonization\u2014the one from Central India and the other from the Orissa delta. During historical times the head-quarters of the Kandhs was for long in the State of Bod, a broken plateau, intersected by low ridges, the last refuge of their race. A description of this tract is given in the previous article (KANDH-MALS, q.v.), and a full account of the race will be found in Hunter's Orissa, vol. ii. pp. 68 to 102 (1872). The following abstract of that account must here suffice:\n\n'The Kandh idea of government is purely patriarchal. The family\nis strictly ruled by the father. The grown-up sons have no property during his life, but live in his house with their wives and children, and all share the common meal prepared by the grandmother. The clan consisted of a number of families, sprung from a common father; and the tribe was made up in like manner from a number of clans who claim descent from the same ancestor. The head of the tribe was usually the eldest son of the patriarchal family; but if not fit for the post he was set aside, and an uncle or a younger brother appointed. He could enter on no undertaking without calling together the heads of clans, who in their turn consulted the heads of families.\n\nAccording to the Kandh theory of existence, a state of war might be lawfully presumed against all neighbours with whom no express agreement had been made to the contrary. Murders were punished by blood-revenge, the kinsmen within a certain degree being on\u00e9 and all bound to kill the slayer, unless appeased by a payment of grain or cattle. The man who accidentally or wrongfully wounded another had to maintain the sufferer until he recovered from his hurt. A stolen article must be returned, or its equivalent paid; but the Kandh twice convicted of theft was driven forth from his tribe, the greatest punishment known to the race. Disputes were settled by combat, or by the ordeal of boiling oil or heated iron, or by taking a solemn oath on an ant-hill, or on a tiger's claw, or a lizard's skin. When a house-father died, leaving no sons, his land was parcelled out among the other male heads of the village; for no woman, nor indeed any Kandh, was allowed to hold land who could not with his own hand defend it. The patriarch, or the tribal assembly, was wont to summon the clansmen to war by an arrow borne by swift messengers from glen to glen. The Kandh adorned himself for battle as for a feast, and his fights resembled in many respects the listed combats of medi\u00e6val chivalry, such as that described by Sir Walter Scott in *The Fair Maid of Perth*. The most approved form was to go on fighting day after day until one party or the other was wholly exterminated.\n\nAn eye-witness has described a conflict which lasted for three days, the challenge being renewed every morning by throwing down a piece of bloody cloth upon the battle-field. Such a fight yielded a pleasurable excitement not only to the warriors themselves, but to both their villages. The women and old men past bearing arms stood close behind the combatants during the conflict, handing them pots of water and cooked food, with much good advice as to the conduct of the fight. When the first man fell, all rushed to dip their axes in his blood, and hacked the body in pieces; while the man who slew his enemy without getting a wound himself, hewed off the right arm from the corpse, and ran with it to the priest among the non-combatants in the rear, as an offering to the God of War. Before evening a great heap of\nright arms had thus accumulated on each rear,\u2014one side having lost sixty men, and the other thirty, besides at least as many more mortally wounded, as the result of the first day's pastime.\n\n'The Kandh uses a curiously carved sword with singular effect and dexterity; besides the two-handed axe, a bow and arrows, and a sling. He disdains any shield, but guards with the handle of his axe. His favourite bowshot is a sort of ricochet, the arrow touching the ground with its heel \"at a short distance from its object, which it strikes in rising, below the line of vision.\" The Kandh never claims the victory as the reward of his personal valour, but invariably, and with perfect good faith, ascribes it to the favour of his god.\n\n'The Kandh system of tillage represents a stage half-way between the migratory cultivation of the ruder non-Aryan tribes and the settled agriculture of the Hindus. They do not, on the one hand, merely burn down a patch in the jungle, take a few crops off it, and then move on to fresh clearings. Nor, on the other hand, do they go on cultivating the same fields from father to son. When their lands show signs of exhaustion, they desert them; and it was a rule in some of their settlements to change their village sites once in fourteen years. Caste is unknown; and, as among the Sant\u00e1ls, marriage between relations, or even within the same tribe, is forbidden. A Kandh wedding consists of forcibly carrying off the bride in the middle of a feast. The boy's father pays a price for the girl, and usually chooses a strong one, several years older than his son. In this way, Kandh maidens are married at about fourteen, Kandh boys at about ten. The bride remains as a servant in her new father-in-law's house till her boy-husband grows old enough to live with her. She generally acquires a great influence over him; and a Kandh may not marry a second wife during the life of his first one, except with her consent.\n\n'The Kandh engages only in husbandry and war, and despises all other work. But attached to each village is a row of hovels inhabited by a lower race, who are not allowed to hold land, to go forth to battle, or to join in the village worship. These poor people do the dirty work of the hamlet, and supply families of hereditary weavers, blacksmiths, potters, herdsmen, and distillers. They are kindly treated, and a portion of each feast is (or used to be) left for them. But they can never rise in the social scale. No Kandh could engage in their work without degradation, nor can he eat food prepared by their hands. They can give no account of their origin, but are supposed to be the remnants of a ruder race whom the Kandhs found in possession of the hills when they themselves were pushed backwards by the Aryans from the plains. When the British first came into the country these \"attached families\" were practically village serfs, and represented even a lower stage of social existence than the outcasts of a Hindu village.\nThe Kandhs, like the Santals, have many deities, race-gods, tribe-gods, family-gods, and a multitude of malignant spirits and demons. But their great divinity is the Earth-god, who represents the productive energy of nature. Twice each year, at sowing-time and at harvest, before or after battle, and in all seasons of special calamity, the Earth-god required a human sacrifice. The duty of providing the victims rested with the lower race attached to the Kandh village. Br\u00e1hmans and Kandhs were the only classes exempted from sacrifice, and an ancient rule ordained that the offering must be bought with a price. Men of the lower race kidnapped the victims from the plains, and a thriving Kandh village usually kept a small stock in reserve, \"to meet sudden demands for atonement.\" The victim, on being brought to the hamlet, was welcomed at every threshold, daintily fed, and kindly treated till the fatal day arrived. He was then solemnly sacrificed to the Earth-god, the Kandhs shouting in his dying ear, \"We bought you with a price; no sin rests with us!\" His flesh and blood were distributed among the village fields, or worked into the furrows.\n\nIn 1835, the Kandhs passed under our rule, and these rites had to cease. Their proud spirit shrank from compulsion; but after many tribal councils, they agreed to give up their stock of victims as a valuable present to their new suzerain. Care was taken that they should not procure fresh ones. The kidnapping of victims for human sacrifice was declared a capital offence; and their priests were led to discover that goats or buffaloes did quite as well for the Earth-god under British rule as human sacrifices. Hitherto they had consisted of separate tribes, always at war with each other and with the world. Under able English administrators (especially Campbell, Macpherson, and Cadenhead), human sacrifices were abolished, and the Kandhs were formed into a united and peaceful race (1837-45). The British officer removed their old necessity for tribal wars and family blood-feuds by setting himself up as a central authority. He adjusted their inter-tribal disputes, and punished heinous crimes. Major Samuel Charters Macpherson, in particular, won over the more troublesome clans to quiet industry. He made the chiefs vain of carrying out his orders by small presents of cattle, honorific dresses, and titles. He enlisted the whole race on his side by picking out their best men for the police; and drew the tribes into amicable relations among themselves by means of hill-fairs. He constructed roads, and taught them to trade, with a view to \"drawing them from their fastnesses into friendly contact with other men.\" The race has prospered and multiplied under British rule. \"The voluntary and permanent acknowledgment of our sovereignty,\" wrote Macpherson, \"must depend upon our ability to discharge beneficially and acceptably towards them the duty of sovereignty. They will yield allegiance to us only in return for advantages which are suited in form and in spirit to\ntheir leading ideas, and to their social wants.\" The patriarchal authority within each Kandh tribe was still perfect, but centuries of clan feuds had taught them the evils caused by the want of any power sufficiently strong to enforce arbitration between the various tribes. \"Justice,\" continued Macpherson, \"betwixt the independent societies, is, in a word, the great want felt by all.\" Setting out with this idea of Government having a right to exist only if it could discharge certain specific functions really required by the people, this young officer gradually gained over the priesthood and the village heads. He appealed to their passionate desire to own land, by grants of jungle tracts of little use to us but a paradise to them, and where he could keep them well under his eye. But while he thus laboured by gentle and politic devices to win the affections of the race, he made it distinctly understood that such measures of conciliation would, if necessary, be enforced by the British power. The Kandhs are now a peaceable, easily-managed race; and Hindu traders journey with safety through the recesses of their hills.\n\n**K\u00e1nd\u00ed.**\u2014Sub-division of Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal. Area, 389 square miles, with 618 towns or villages, and 62,500 houses, of which 57,242 are occupied.

Hindus numbered 156,807; Muhammadans, 66,936; and aboriginal tribes, 215.\n\nIn 1873, the Sub-division of K\u00e1nd\u00ed was abolished in consequence of transfers to and from B\u00edrbh\u00fam. It was, however, reconstituted as a Sub-division of Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, but with a reduced area, in 1879. It comprises the three police circles of K\u00e1nd\u00ed (including Baruah), Bharatpur, and Kharg\u00e1o\u0144. In 1883 it contained 1 civil and 1 revenue court, with a regular police force of 129 men, and a village watch of 1684 men.\n\n**K\u00e1nd\u00ed** (or J\u00e1m\u00fa K\u00e1nd\u00ed).\u2014Town and municipality in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal, and head-quarters of the K\u00e1nd\u00ed Sub-division; situated in the extreme south-east of the District, at the point where the river Mor enters from B\u00edrbh\u00fam.

K\u00e1nd\u00ed owes much of its importance to the circumstance that it is the residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of P\u00e1ikp\u00e1r\u00e1, a wealthy and devout Hindu family. The founder of this family was Gang\u00e1 Govind Singh, the banty\u00e1 of Warren Hastings, who was born at K\u00e1nd\u00ed, and retired thither in his old age with an immense fortune, which he devoted to the erection of shrines and images of Krishna. His name has acquired a traditional celebrity for the most magnificent sraddha, or\nfuneral obsequies, ever performed in Bengal. This was celebrated in honour of his mother, and is stated to have cost 20 l\u0101khs of rupees, or \u00a3200,000. The guests on the occasion included the R\u0101j\u0101s and zam\u012bnd\u0101rs of half Bengal, presided over by the Br\u0101hman R\u0101j\u0101 Sib Chandra of Krishnagar, in Nadiya.

Kandi\u00e1ro is the head-quarters station of a mukhti\u00e1rk\u00e1r and tapad\u00e1r, with their establishments, and has police lines for 11 men. There are, besides, a subordinate judge's court, post-office, market, school-house, District bungalow, and dharm\u015b\u0101la. The municipality, established in February 1861, had an income in 1882\u201383 of \u00a3145; municipal expenditure, \u00a3108; incidence of taxation, 1s. per head of municipal population. Population (1872) 2578; (1881) 2367. The principal occupation of the people is agriculture, but the Hindu portion of the inhabitants are engaged in trade, which is mainly in grain and cloth. Manufactures of coarse paper and country cloth. The town of Kandi\u00e1ro is said to have been built during the reign of the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. Before it was built, there was another in existence close to it, called Patoipur, which was abandoned, owing to an unusual rise of the inundation waters. The site of the present town was then chosen as being somewhat more elevated; and having at the time a large number of kandi (Prosopis spicigera) trees growing upon it, the place took, it is supposed, from this circumstance the name of Kandi\u00e1ro.\nKandil\u00ed.\u2014Town in Narsinghpur District, Central Provinces.\u2014See KANDELI.\n\nKandrawan.\u2014Town in Salon tahsil, R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli District, Oudh; situated on the bank of the Ganges on the road from Salon to Must\u00e1f\u00e1b\u00e1d, 30 miles from R\u00e1\u00ed Bareli town, and 6 from M\u00e1nikpur.

The cattle are celebrated throughout the Presidency. Every village has a handsome tope or cluster of trees. In the western part of the t\u00e1luk is situated the zamind\u00e1ri of Chundi, separated from the Kanigiri t\u00e1luk by a range of hills running north and south for about 15 miles. They are of considerable elevation, and the slopes are covered with dense jungle. In 1883 there were 2 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 12; regular police, 83 men; land revenue, \u00a327,974.\n\nKanduk\u00far.\u2014Town in the Kanduk\u00far t\u00e1luk of Nellore District, Madras Presidency.

K\u00e1ngra forms the north-eastern District of the J\u00e1landhar (Jullundur) Division. This vast tract stretches eastwards from the plain country of the B\u00e1ri and J\u00e1landhar Do\u00e1bs over the Him\u00e1layan ranges, and far into Tibet. It is bounded on the north-east by the great Him\u00e1layan range which forms the valley of the Upper Indus, and separates the District from the Tibetan region of Rakshu and the territories of the Chinese Empire; on the south-east by the Hill States of Bashahr (Bass\u00e1hir), Mandi, and Bil\u00e1spur (Kahl\u00far); on the south-west by Hoshi\u00e1rpur District; and on the north-west by the Chaki torrent which divides it from the hill portion of Gurd\u00e1sipur District, and by the Native State of Chamba. The District is divided into five *tahsils* or Sub-divisions, of which those of Ham\u00edrpur, Dera, and N\u00farpur proceeding from east to west lie along the south-western border, together with the K\u00e1ngra valley, among or below the outer Him\u00e1layas. The K\u00e1ngra *tahsil* occupies the centre of the District, and connects by a narrow neck, known as Bang\u00e1hal, the three first-named *tahsils* with the outlying tract that forms the K\u00falu *tahsil*. This last includes K\u00falu Proper to the south of the Pfr Panjab or mid-Him\u00e1layan range; and the outlying cantons of L\u00e1hul and Spiti, which may be said to belong geographically rather to Tibet than to India. K\u00e1ngra stands second in order of area, and ninth in order of population, among the 32 Districts of the Punjab, comprising 8'51 per cent. of the total area, and 3'88 per cent. of the total population of the Province. Area, 9069 square miles. Population (1881) 730,845 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at the sanitarium of Dh\u00e1rmsala, among the spurs of the Dh\u00e1ola Dh\u00e1r, about twelve miles north-east of K\u00e1ngra town.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The District of K\u00e1ngra is an artificial administrative division, comprising a vast and heterogeneous tract, which extends eastward from the plain country of the B\u00e1ri and J\u00e1landhar (Jullundur) Do\u00e1bs, across two distinct Him\u00e1layan ranges, far into the heart of Tibet. In shape it forms two separate blocks, lying on either side of the outer Him\u00e1layan chain, which bounds the horizon of the Punjab plains. The western block, which constitutes K\u00e1ngra Proper, consists of an irregular triangle, whose base lies upon the Hoshi\u00e1rpur border, while the Native States of Chamba and Mandi constrict its upper portion to a narrow neck, known as Bang\u00e1hal, at one point less than ten miles in width. Beyond this point, the eastern block expands once more like an hour-glass, and embraces the mid-Him\u00e1layan tract of Kulu, with the Tibetan Sub-divisions of L\u00e1hul and Spiti. The District thus\nnaturally falls into three parts; the sub-Him\u00e1layan country of K\u00e1ngra Proper, with an area of 2620 square miles, and a population of 613,626, or 234 per square mile; the mid-Him\u00e1layan tract, including the K\u00falu valley, and Bang\u00e1hal (lying partly on the K\u00e1ngra and partly on the K\u00falu side of the outer range), with an area of 2039 square miles, and a population of 108,497, or 53 per square mile; and the rugged outer region of the Tibetan slopes, comprising the cantons of L\u00e1hul and Spiti, with an area of 4410 square miles, and a population of 8722, or only 2 persons per square mile.\n\nThe heights of these ridges and the interlying valleys increase in a progressive ratio as they recede from the plains. Budi Pind, on the border of Hoshi\u00e1rpur District, has an elevation of only 937 feet above sea-level, the first or lower range has an average elevation of between 3500 and 4000 feet, while the third range rises to elevations varying from 3900 to 15,956 feet in the Dh\u00e1ola Dh\u00e1r or Snowy Range, which forms the northern boundary of K\u00e1ngra Proper. Beyond this, a transverse ridge, the Bar\u00e1 Bang\u00e1hal, towers in K\u00falu into peaks of from 17,000 to over 20,000 feet.\n\nThe breadth of these ranges and the intervening distances are very uncertain and arbitrary. The ridge which bounds the plains has a uniform width of about twelve miles, and the sides descend in nearly equal angles from the summit. The second range does not possess the same simplicity of structure, though generally more regular than any of the ranges to the north. In its upper portion, the declivities on either flank slope gradually down, affording sites for villages and terraced cultivation. But when the chain divides into two separate branches, the aspect is essentially altered; the hills rise abruptly from the valley below, and the ascent on both sides becomes toilsome and severe; the inclination is too great for anything but forest and underwood to grow. There is usually, however, a good deal of table-land at the top; and though the sides are uninhabited, the crest of the range is occupied by villages, and assiduously cultivated. To the north of this range, the hills run into every variety of form and structure. As a general rule, the southern slopes are wild and forbidding, and the crests rugged and angular, affording scarcely room for the foot to tread. But the northern flank of such a range will often offer a striking contrast. The descent becomes gradual and easy, and the jungle and rocks which obstructed the traveller on the other side give way to open fields and farm-houses, extending in successive tiers to the stream below. The contour of the snowy range itself, the Dh\u00e1ola Dh\u00e1r, is of the same nature. Its appearance towards the plains is abrupt and perpendicular; while the northern spurs sweep in long and gentle slopes to the river R\u00e1vi. In other parts, again, the entire range will be covered with dense woods, unrelieved by a single trace of civilised life. Here and there, on crags\nmore than usually steep, is a hill fort, once the scene of border hopes and jealousies, but now a mass of dismantled ruins deepening the original solitude of the place. Occasionally the hills subside into undulating knolls, scarcely to be distinguished from the level of the valleys. Here the accessible character of the country has early attracted settlers, and the whole expanse teems with the fruits of human industry.\n\nThe Dh\u00e1ola Dh\u00e1r range cuts into two halves the t\u00e1luk of Bang\u00e1hal, which, while forming a portion of the K\u00e1ngra tahsil, is the connecting link between K\u00e1ngra Proper and K\u00falu. The northern half is called Bar\u00e1 Bang\u00e1hal, and is separated from K\u00falu by the Bar\u00e1 Bang\u00e1hal range, a transverse range about 15 miles in length, with a mean elevation of 18,000 feet, connecting the Dh\u00e1ola Dh\u00e1r with the central Him\u00e1layan range, which, with an area of 290 square miles, contains only one village situated at the lowest point of the valley, some 8500 feet above the sea, and inhabited by some forty Kanet families. A few years ago a number of the houses were swept away, not for the first time, by an avalanche. On more than three sides the mountains slope steeply up from the very banks of the R\u00e1vi, whose head-waters are situated in this tract, and rise into peaks of from 17,000 to over 20,000 feet in height. Near the bottom of some of the ravines there is a good deal of pine forest; higher up come long bare slopes, which, when the snows are melted, afford splendid grazing for some three months for numerous flocks of sheep and goats. Above these grazing grounds come glaciers, bare rocks, and fields of perpetual snow. The southern half of Bang\u00e1hal is called Chhot\u00e1 Bang\u00e1hal, and is divided into two parts by a branch range of over 10,000 feet in height thrown out by the Dh\u00e1ola Dh\u00e1r. Some eighteen or nineteen small villages, inhabited solely by Kanets and D\u00e1ghis, are scattered here and there in the lower part of the valleys. The slope of the ground is everywhere very steep, and the general appearance of the country wild and gloomy. The rest of the t\u00e1luk is known as B\u00edr Bang\u00e1hal, and forms one of the prettiest parts of the District. In physical features as well as in scenery it resembles the country along the foot of the Dh\u00e1ola Dh\u00e1r.\n\nThe three parallel lines of mountain ranges, with a transverse ridge, form four main basins, in each of which a great river takes its rise\u2014the Beas (Bi\u00e1s), the Spiti, the Chen\u00e1b, and the R\u00e1vi. The Beas has its origin in the Rohtang mountains, north of K\u00falu, and, after flowing southward for about 50 miles, traverses the State of Mandi, and then drains the whole valley of K\u00e1ngra Proper, and passes on into the Punjab plain. The Spiti, rising in the Tibetan valley of the same name, runs due south to join the Sutlej (Satlaj) in the Native State of Bashahr. The Chen\u00e1b springs from the slopes of L\u00e1hul, and runs north of the central Him\u00e1layas into the State of Chamba; while the R\u00e1vi, draining the Bang\u00e1hal valley, keeps to the south of the same\nchain and flows north-westward, also into Chamba. From the great variety of the different tracts included in the District by modern arrangements, it is impossible to assign any general physical peculiarities to the whole beyond their common characteristic as mountainous regions, intersected by snowy chains and scored by deep river valleys. The western portion, abutting on the Punjab plains, admits of cultivation, and supports a comparatively dense Hindu population; while the bare and sterile eastern glens of Spiti are sparsely inhabited by a Tibetan race. Further particulars will be found under the separate headings of Kangra Proper, Kulu, Lahul, and Spiti.\n\nForests.\u2014The area occupied by forest is roughly estimated at 300,000 acres. The forests are situated for the most part on the northern slopes of the ranges, and contain much useful timber; while, owing to the great range of elevation, all zones are represented, from the tropical bamboo which clothes the lower hills, to the alpine vegetation, oak, pine, and rhododendron of the higher ranges. Merchants from Ludhi\u00e1na occasionally come up and cut the extensive bamboo forests in the neighbourhood of the river Sutlej. Of pines by far the commonest and most useful is the chil (Pinus longifolia), which grows luxuriantly on the northern declivity of the inner hills. Detached trees are found in the Jaw\u00e1la Mukhi valley at an elevation of only 1600 feet above sea-level, and the same species is found in the snowy ranges as high as 7000 feet. The luxuriance and compactness of the timber increase with the elevation up to 5000 or 6000 feet, and the climate of this region is the best suited for its development; above and below this point the tree gradually deteriorates. The wood of this tree is not held in much repute, and if allowed to lie in the forest exposed to the weather, the timber becomes perfectly decomposed in the course of two years. It is largely used for conversion into charcoal; and in the more accessible situations, this tree has now become scarce. Two other species of pine are found in the snowy range above Dharm\u00e1s\u00e1la, growing at an elevation of from 8000 to 11,000 feet\u2014the rai (Abies Smithiana) and the tos (Abies Webbiana); but although the trees are exceedingly handsome, with straight stems, and attain a height of from 90 to 100 feet in height, the timber is said to be inferior to that of the chil, and is only utilized for cutting shingles for roofing. The deodar or kelu (Cedrus deodara) is not found in Kangra Proper, but fine forests exist in the K\u00falu Subdivision. In the Dh\u00e1ola Dh\u00e1r range and in K\u00falu are many varieties of oak. The commonest kind is the b\u00e1n (Quercus incana), which grows at an elevation of between 3000 and 8000 feet. Another variety of oak, the khars\u00fai (Quercus semecarpifolia), grows at an elevation of 8000 feet, and ascends beyond even the range of pines. The other Him\u00e1layan trees include several varieties of rhododendron, the horse chestnut, holly, sycamore, yew, elder, wild medlar, a species of poplar,\nand the birch. In the lower ranges and valleys are isolated trees of *t\u00fan* (Cedrela toona) and *shisham* (Dalbergia sissoo). There is only one forest of *s\u00e1l* (Shorea robusta), at Andreta in the P\u00e1lam valley. Several species of acacia are found in the lower hills bordering on the plains, the two most valuable being the *siris* (Acacia sirissa), and the *khair* (Acacia catechu). The other valuable timber trees include the *jam\u00fan* (Eugenia Jambolana), *arj\u00fan* (Terminalia Arjuna) *kakar* or *kakren* (Rhus punjabensis), a handsome yellow-grained wood, *karambh* (Zizyphus xylopyra), *kaimal* (Ficus infectoria), *badror* (Machilus odoratissimus), and the *ch\u00e1mba* (Jasminum revolutum). The banyan tree, *bor* or *bar* (Ficus indica), the *pipal* (Ficus religiosa), and the *sembhal* or *simul* (Bombax heptaphyllum), are commonly found up to an elevation of 4000 feet. One of the most common trees on the ridges of the fields is the *dh\u00e1man*, the branches of which are cut in winter as fodder for the cattle. Wild fruits include the cherry, raspberry, blackberry, barberry, strawberry, medlar, fig, and *ber* (Zizyphus jujuba). Almost every dwelling in the hills is encircled with fruit-trees of various kinds in a half-wild, half-cultivated state. The most common cultivated-fruit-trees are the mulberry, mango, plantain, peach, pomegranate, lime, citron, orange, and in the higher villages walnut and apricot. In gardens belonging to the more wealthy classes may be added the vine, apple, plum, and guava.\n\n**Minerals.**\u2014Valuable metal ores are known to exist in the Kangra hills, and are worked with sufficient results to meet local demands; but difficulties of carriage, and scantiness of fuel in the vicinity of the works, have hitherto formed an effectual bar to the prospect of profitably working the mines on a large scale. Iron is the metal most largely worked, but antimony, lead, and copper are also found. Gold in minute quantities exists in the sands of the Beas. Coal, or rather lignite, is also produced, but in insignificant quantities. The iron mines, eight in number in 1883, are in the Bang\u00e1hal tract, which extends for some 14 miles along the banks of the river Ul, its centre being at the village of Dharm\u00e1ni, where the principal mines are situated. The ore is in the form of crystals of magnetic oxide of iron embedded in decomposed and friable mica schists, and is worked from open quarries. It is one of the most valuable forms of ore, being readily reduced by charcoal, in furnaces of the simplest description, and yielding the very best quality of iron. Specimens sent to England for testing proved to be superior to the best English, and quite equal to any imported Swedish iron. Notwithstanding its high quality, the excessive cost of production, principally caused by difficulties in the way of carriage, prevents the iron from being used for other than special local purposes, and from competing with cheaper English-imported iron. The eight mines yielded an out-turn of only\n90 maunds or \\(3\\frac{1}{2}\\) tons in 1882-83. The K\u00falu Sub-division especially possesses great potential wealth, which only requires facilities of communication to allow of its proper development. In the Waz\u00edr\u00ed R\u00fapi tract, veins of silver, copper, and lead have been discovered; and in 1869, a monopoly of working the mines in this division was granted to an English gentleman. His proceedings, however, were not attended with any marked success, and the lease was cancelled in 1883. Negotiations with several English capitalists for a fresh lease were in progress in 1884. Slates of good quality are found in many places in K\u00e1ngra Proper and in K\u00falu. They are too coarse for many purposes to which slates are usually applied, but from their hardness, they are superior in durability to Welsh slates. Many quarries are worked by natives on the ranges surrounding Dharms\u00e1la, and European capital has been applied to working quarries at Kari\u00e1na with much success. The use of slates for roofing is extending, and the majority of well-to-do people within easy reach of the quarries have adopted it for their houses. The slates are also exported to J\u00e1l\u00e1ndhar, Amb\u00e1l\u00e1, and other places in the Punjab. The greater portion of the out-turn is consumed locally, but the heavy cost of carriage alone stands in the way of a large export. Sandstone of various degrees of hardness, and suitable for building purposes, is found throughout the District. Limestone in great abundance exists in the Upper K\u00e1ngra range; and the salt-rock of the neighbouring State of Mandi can be traced over the border into the District.\n\nIn the neighbourhood of Jaw\u00e1la Mukhi, a town 22 miles south of K\u00e1ngra fort, there occur at intervals, extending over some 30 miles of country, six mineral springs, issuing from the southern base of the Jaw\u00e1la Mukhi hills. They contain a considerable quantity of chloride of sodium or common salt, together with iodine in the form of iodide of potassium. Hot sulphur springs are numerous in K\u00falu Sub-division, the best known of which are at M\u00e1nikarn, B\u00e1sisht, and Kal\u00e1t, the first in the valley of the P\u00e1rbat\u00ed, and the two latter on the banks of the Beas. At M\u00e1nikarn the springs are above boiling point, and rice is cooked in the water simply by placing the grain in a bag and throwing it into the pool. The springs are much resorted to by pilgrims and diseased persons from all parts of India.\n\nFauna.\u2014The forests of K\u00e1ngra District abound with game of all descriptions. Of the larger animals, leopards, bears, hy\u00e6nas, wolves, and various kinds of deer are common. Tigers visit the District occasionally, but are not indigenous to these hills. The ibex is found in L\u00e1hul, Spiti, K\u00falu, and Bar\u00e1 Bang\u00e1hal; and the musk deer in K\u00falu and on the slopes of the Dh\u00e1ola Dh\u00e1r. The wild hog is common in many forests in the lower ranges. Of smaller quadrupeds, the badger, porcupine, ant-eater, and otter are commonly found. Different species\nof wild cat, the flying squirrel, hare, and marmot abound in the hills. Game birds are particularly abundant, the ornithology of both hill and plain being richly represented. Several species of pheasant are found, among which are the mun\u00e1l and argus, famous for their plumage, which fetches a high price in Europe. The most common species is the white-crested pheasant. The red jungle-fowl is met with in all parts of the lower valleys. Of partridges many species are found, from the common chikor of the plains to the snow partridge of the Upper Him\u00e1layas. Quail and snipe are common. Ducks, geese, and other water birds are seen upon the Beas at the beginning and end of summer, but not as permanent visitors. Fishing is not carried on to any great extent. Thirty-six fisheries are leased out to contractors, mostly on the Beas, a few only being in the lower parts of the hill torrents.\n\nHistory.\u2014The hills of K\u00e1ngra Proper have formed for many centuries the dominions of numerous petty princes, all of whom traced their descent to the ancient Katoch (R\u00e1jput) kings of J\u00e1landhar (Jullundur). According to the mythical chronology of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, their dynasty first established itself in the country between the Sutlej and the Beas fifteen hundred years before the Christian era. In the 7th century A.D., Hiuen Tsiang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, found the J\u00e1landhar monarchy still undivided. At some later period, perhaps that of the Musalm\u00e1n invasion, the Katoch princes were driven into the hills, where K\u00e1ngra already existed as one of their chief fortresses, and their restricted dominions appear afterwards to have fallen asunder into several minor principalities. Some of these now belong politically to Hoshi\u00e1rpur District, while some still remain independent; but the States of N\u00farpur, S\u00edba, Goler, Bang\u00e1hal, and K\u00e1ngra are included in the modern British Sub-division of K\u00e1ngra Proper. In spite of constant invasions, the little Hindu kingdoms, secure within their Him\u00e1layan glens, long held out against the aggressive Musalm\u00e1n power. In 1009, the riches of the Nagarkot temple attracted the attention of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed, who defeated the Hindu princes at Pesh\u00e1war, seized the fort of K\u00e1ngra, and plundered the shrine of an immense booty in gold, silver, and jewels. But, thirty-five years later, the mountaineers rose against the Muhammadan garrison, besieged and retook the fort, with the assistance of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Delhi, and set up a fac-simile of the image which Mahm\u00fad had carried away. From this time, K\u00e1ngra does not reappear in general history till 1360, when the Emperor Firoz Tughlak again led a force against it. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 gave in his submission, and was permitted to retain his dominions; but the Muhammadans once more plundered the temple, and despatched the famous image to Mecca, where it was cast upon the high road to be trodden under the feet of the faithful.\n\nTwo hundred years later, in 1556, Akbar commanded in person\nan expedition into the hills, and succeeded in permanently occupying the fort of Kangra. The fruitful valley was made into an imperial demesne, and only the barren hills remained in the possession of the native chiefs. In the graphic language of Akbar's famous minister, Todar Mall, 'he cut off the meat and left the bones.' Yet the remoteness of the imperial capital and the natural strength of the mountain fastnesses encouraged the Rajput princes to rebel, and the Emperor Jahangir was twice engaged (in 1615 and 1628) in reducing his unruly Katoch vassals to subjection. On the last occasion, 22 chieftains promised obedience and tribute, and agreed to send hostages to Agra. At one time, Jahangir intended to build a summer residence in the valley, and the site of the proposed palace is still pointed out in the lands of the village of Gargari. Probably the superior attractions of Kashmir, which the Emperor shortly afterwards visited, led to the abandonment of his design. By the time of the accession of Shah Jah\u00e1n, the hill Raj\u00e1s had quietly settled down into the position of tributaries, and the commands of the Emperor were received and executed with ready obedience. Letters patent (sanads) are still extant, issued between the reigns of Akbar and Aurangzeb, appointing individuals to various judicial and revenue offices such as that of kazi, k\u00e1n\u00edng\u00f3, or chaudhari. In some instances, the present representatives of the family continue to enjoy privileges and powers conferred on their ancestors by the Mughal Emperors, the honorary appellation being retained even where the duties have become obsolete.\n\nDuring the period of Muhammadan ascendancy the hill princes appear on the whole to have been liberally treated. They still enjoyed a considerable share of power, and ruled unmolested over the extensive tracts which yet remained to them. They built forts, made war upon each other, and wielded the functions of petty sovereigns. On the demise of a chief, his successor paid the fees of investiture, and received a confirmation of his title, with an honorary dress from Agra or Delhi. The loyalty of the hill Raj\u00e1s appears to have won the favour and confidence of their conquerors, and they were frequently deputed on hazardous expeditions, and appointed to places of high trust in the service of the Empire. Thus in the time of Shah Jah\u00e1n (1646), Jagat Chand, Raj\u00e1 of Nurpur, at the head of 14,000 Rajputs, raised in his own country, conducted a most difficult but successful enterprise against the Uzbeks of Balkh and Badakhshan. Again in the early part of the reign of Aurangzeb (1661), Raj\u00e1 Mandata, grandson of Jagat Chand, was deputed to the charge of Bami\u00e1n and Ghorband on the western frontier of the Mughal Empire, eight days' journey beyond the city of Kabul. Twenty years after he was a second time appointed to this honourable post, and created a mansabd\u00e1r of 2000 horse. In later days (1758), Raj\u00e1 Ghamand Chand of Kangra\nwas appointed Governor of the Jalandhar Do\u00e1b and the hill country between the Satlaj and R\u00e1vi.\n\nIn 1752, the Katoch principalities nominally formed part of the territories ceded to Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1n\u00ed by the declining Delhi court. But the native chieftains, emboldened by the prevailing anarchy, resumed their practical independence, and left little to the Dur\u00e1n\u00ed Sult\u00e1n or to the Deputy who still held the isolated fort of Kangra for the Mughal Empire. In 1774, the Sikh chieftain, Jai Singh, obtained the fort by stratagem, but relinquished it in 1785 to Sans\u00e1r Chand, the legitimate Rajput prince of Kangra, to whom the State was thus restored about two centuries after its occupation by Akbar. This prince, by his vigorous measures, made himself supreme throughout the whole Katoch country, and levied tribute from his fellow-chieftains in all the neighbouring States. Every year, on fixed occasions, these princes were obliged to attend his court, and to accompany him with their contingents wherever he undertook a military expedition. For twenty years he reigned supreme throughout these hills, and raised his name to a height of renown never attained by any ancestor of his race. He found himself unable, however, to cope with the Sikhs, and two descents upon the Sikh possessions in the plains, in 1803 and 1804, were repelled by Ranj\u00edt Singh. In 1805, Sans\u00e1r Chand attacked the hill State of Bil\u00e1spur (Kahl\u00far), which called in the dangerous aid of the G\u00farkhas, already masters of the wide tract between the Gogra and the Sutlej (Satlaj). The G\u00farkhas responded to the call by crossing the latter river, and attacking the Katoches at Mahal Mori, in May 1806. The invaders gained a complete victory, overran a large part of the hill country of Kangra, and kept up a constant warfare with the Rajput chieftains who still retained the remainder. The people fled as refugees to the plains, while the minor princes aggravated the general disorder by acts of anarchy on their own account. The horrors of the G\u00farkha invasion still burn in the memories of the people. The country ran with blood, not a blade of cultivation was to be seen, and grass grew and tigers whelped in the streets of the deserted towns. At length, after three years of lawlessness, Sans\u00e1r Chand determined to invoke the assistance of the Sikhs. Ranj\u00edt Singh, always ready to seize upon every opportunity for aggression, entered Kangra and gave battle to the G\u00farkhas, in August 1809. After a long and furious contest, the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 was successful, and the G\u00farkhas abandoned their conquests beyond the Sutlej. Ranj\u00edt Singh at first guaranteed to Sans\u00e1r Chand the possession of all his dominions except the fort of Kangra and 66 villages, allotted for the support of the garrison; but he gradually made encroachments upon all the hill chieftains. Sans\u00e1r Chand died in 1824, an obsequious tributary of Lahore. His son, Anrud Chand, succeeded him, but after a reign of four years abandoned his throne, and exiled\nhimself to Hardw\u00e1r, rather than submit to a demand from Ranj\u00edt Singh for the hand of his sister in marriage to a son of the Sikh minister Dhi\u00e1n Singh. Immediately after Anr\u00fad\u2019s flight in 1828, Ranjit Singh attached the whole of his territory, and the last portion of the once powerful K\u00e1ngra State came finally into the possession of the Sikhs.\n\nK\u00e1ngra passed to the British at the end of the first Sikh war in 1845; but the commandant of the fort held out for some time on his own account. When the M\u00falt\u00e1n (Mooltan) insurrection broke out in April 1848, emissaries from the plains incited the hill chieftains to revolt; and at the end of August in the same year, R\u00e1m Singh, a Path\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1 R\u00e1jput, collected a band of adventurers and threw himself into the fort of Sh\u00e1hpur. Shortly afterwards, the Katoch chief rebelled in the eastern extremity of the District, and was soon followed by the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Jaswan and Dat\u00e1rpur, and the Sikh priest, Bedi Bikram\u00e1 Singh. The revolt, however, was speedily suppressed; and after the victory of Gujr\u00e1t, the insurgent chiefs received sentence of banishment to Almora, while K\u00e1ngra subsided quietly into a British District. After the outbreak of the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857, some disturbances took place in K\u00falu Sub-division, but the vigorous measures of precaution adopted by the local authorities, and the summary execution of the six ringleaders and imprisonment of others on the occasion of the first overt act of rebellion, effectually subdued any tendency to lawlessness. The disarming of the Native troops in the forts of K\u00e1ngra and N\u00farpur was effected quietly and without opposition. Nothing has since occurred to disturb the peace of the District. For the history of LAHUL, SPITI, and KULU, see the articles on those Sub-divisions.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1868 returned the total number of inhabitants for the whole District at 743,882. In 1881, the Census taken over the same area returned a population of 730,845, being a decrease of 13,037, or 1\u00b776 per cent., as compared with the returns of 13 years previous. This decrease is, however, believed to be only apparent. Although railway and other works have induced emigration from the valley of K\u00e1ngra Proper, where the number of inhabitants is very large in proportion to the cultivable area, there were also errors in the previous Census. In 1868, the enumeration was not a synchronous one, and no precautions were taken against double enumeration in L\u00e1hul and Spiti, so that when these tracts were censused after the opening of the passes in spring, a considerable population was counted over again who had already been enumerated during the winter months in the lower valleys of K\u00e1ngra and K\u00falu. Another cause of the decrease, especially in the Dehra and Ham\u00edrpur tahsils, is stated to be due to the late Afgh\u00e1n war, these tahsils supplying a large number of recruits. The details of the Census of 1881 may be briefly summarized as follows:\u2014Area of District, 9069 square miles; number of towns and\nvillages, 681; number of houses, 112,430; number of families, 151,672; total population, 730,845. From these data the following averages may be deduced:\u2014Persons per square mile, 81; villages or townships per square mile, .08; houses per square mile, 15; persons per village, 1073; persons per house, 6.5. But these figures yield results which cannot in every case be compared with those of other Districts, as the population of the Kangra lowlands is comparatively thick, while that of the eastern glens is very scattered, amounting in the Lahul and Spiti tracts, which occupy nearly one-half the area of the entire District, to a density of only 2 persons to the square mile, while in the Kulu tract the density is 53, and in Kangra Proper, as high as 234 to the square mile. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 380,867; females, 349,978; proportion of males, 52.11 per cent. Classified according to age, there were, under 15 years\u2014142,173 boys, 129,749 girls; total children, 271,922, or 37.2 per cent. of the whole population. As regards religious distinctions, Hindus numbered 687,635; Muhammadans, 39,148; Buddhists, 2860; Sikhs, 738; Jains, 133; Christians, 327; and Parsis, 4. The Hindu element thus enormously preponderates over the Muhammadan, the Musalmans only forming small isolated colonies of immigrants, whilst the mass of the population have preserved their ancient faith. The Brahmins were returned at 109,881; Rajputs, 92,836; Raths, 50,767, and Thakurs, 19,122, the two forming lower classes of hill Rajputs; Giraths, cultivators, 108,716; Kanets, almost entirely confined to Kulu, 61,141; Chamars, 51,679; Julahas, 28,129; Dagis, 19,742; Tarkhans, 16,286; Lohars, 15,655; Kolis, 11,301; Jats, 11,118; Domnas, 11,095; and Jhinwars, 10,500. In Spiti the entire population, and in the north of Lahul and a portion of Kulu the majority of the population, consists of Tibetans, ruled over by Rajput landlords. Their religion is Buddhist, with a Hinduizing tendency, and they have all returned themselves as Hindus in the Census, with the exception of the people of Spiti (2862), who, with the exception of one solitary Hindu, all openly profess the Buddhist religion. Brahmanism is rapidly advancing and driving out the admixture of Buddhism. Throughout the rest of the hills, the substratum consists of aborigines, with a considerable Aryan admixture, dominated by a large Aryan body of Brahmins and Rajputs.\n\nSocial and Material Condition of the People.\u2014The homes of the peasantry in Kangra Proper are scattered in pleasant and picturesque localities. They are not collected into villages. Every man resides upon his own farm, and builds his cottage in some selected spot, open as a rule to the sun, but sheltered from the wind. The houses are of sun-dried brick, generally of two storeys. The inmates occupy the lower floor, the upper being used as a lumber room or storehouse for\ngrain, except during the rains, when it is also used for sleeping. The front space before the house is kept clean and fresh, and the whole is encircled by a hedge of trees and brambles. On one side of the cottage is a shed for cows and bullocks, and another for sheep and goats. A well-to-do man also possesses a buffalo or two, which are also kept in separate tenements. The Br\u00e1hmans and R\u00e1jputs occupy the highest sites in the village area, in order that no man of low caste should be able to overlook their households. In the K\u00falu Sub-division, the houses of a village are clustered in rude disorder, with little approach to the semblance of streets; but there is frequently at least one line of houses, which is parallel with another row for some short distance, the buildings at either extremity tailing off, and separating more widely from the rest of the hamlet. Some of the K\u00falu villages are large, and have upwards of a hundred houses; while others are merely detached clusters of a few buildings of a Swiss style of architecture. The walls, occasionally whitewashed or plastered with mud, are formed of tiers of beams and rubble masonry, the timbers for the ceilings of the lower and upper storeys projecting, the first to receive the verandahs which extend all round the house, and a second to support the slate roof. The upper storey forms the dwelling of the household, a rough ladder leading from the lower apartments, which are applied to the stacking of grain or stalling of cattle. A paved enclosure surrounding the house is used for treading the corn, oil-pressing, rice-cleaning, etc. Nearly every house has several beehives which are let into the walls. The house of a K\u00falu zam\u00ednd\u00e1r is a somewhat picturesque object, with its gabled roofs of slate or shingle, overhanging verandahs, and massive stone wall, surrounded by the flat paved court. In the Seor\u00e1j and Waz\u00edr R\u00fapi tracts, it is not uncommon to build houses three and sometimes four storeys high, but in K\u00falu Proper the double storey is preferred. The interior of the houses is furnished generally in the simplest style.\n\nIn K\u00e1ngra Proper during Sikh rule, the agricultural classes used earthen vessels for cooking purposes, either because they were too poor to possess more costly utensils, or they were afraid to show such substantial form of comfort. At the present day, every house has a set of vessels, made of brass, copper, or other metal, according to the prevailing custom. Their bedding consists of mats of rice-straw laid on the floor of the room, and a description of quilt stuffed with pieces of old clothes, and used indifferently as a coverlet or a mattress.\n\nThe chief staples of food are maize and wheat. In the rice-growing valleys the people live to a great extent upon rice, keeping the clean rice for sale, and the chipped and broken grains for their own consumption; in the poorer uplands coarse millets form a portion of their diet. Maize is a favourite grain, and is in constant consumption from\nSeptember to May; while for the remainder of the year wheat is the common article of diet. In most parts of the hills the people can procure fish, which also forms a common article of food. Goat's flesh is eaten by the well-to-do, and on festive occasions among the poorer classes a goat is killed. All but the very poorest classes can afford to use gh\u012b. In the Kangra valley, all the lower castes are consumers of country distilled spirits, and many others drink it secretly, but will not openly acknowledge its use. In Lahul and Spiti, the universal drink is a sort of hill beer known as lugri, of which there are several kinds of varying quality, made either from honey, rice, or wheat, and fermented by means of yeast imported from Ladakh.\n\nThe clothing of the people affords a fair criterion of their prosperity. The ordinary dress of a man of the poorer classes consists of a skull-cap, a frock reaching to the waist (kurti), or a similar but longer garment reaching to the knees (cholu), and a pair of short breeches. In addition to these, the peasant usually carries with him a blanket (patu), which in hot weather serves as a turban to protect his head from the sun, and in winter as a wrapper. Shoes (juta) are almost universally worn by all classes, except in the rains, as the wet weather spoils them. The female dress is picturesque. A Hindu woman ordinarily wears a petticoat (ghagra), a breast covering (choli), long trousers (soth\u00e1n), and a folded mantle (dopata), which also forms the head-dress. For ordinary wear these garments are of the simplest colours; but on gala days, though the cut of the garments is the same, the border of the petticoat is adorned with an edging of silver or gold patterns, or the whole garment is made of streaked colours, tastefully arranged. The plain white dopata or mantle gives place to a pink or yellow scarf, and jewellery is largely worn. The nose-ring (balu) is the most common form of female ornament, and is worn by all women, with the exception of unmarried girls and widows. Except among the lower classes, the nose-ring is made of gold, and its size varies according to the taste or circumstances of the wearer. Necklaces of coloured glass or beads are also largely worn. The men, likewise, are fond of wearing gay apparel and ornaments, such as gold ear-rings, and those who can afford it display gold or silver bracelets and necklaces of alternate beads and gold.\n\nThe hill people are a good-looking race, of fair complexion, with delicate and well-formed features, especially among the Br\u0101hmans and R\u0101jputs. The agricultural classes are less refined in appearance, but they all possess an amiable and ingenuous expression, characteristic of the whole race. In stature they seldom exceed the middle size, and cannot compete with the stalwart Sikh population of the plains for vigour and strength. In address, they are open and good-humoured, and at the same time respectful and obedient. Their phraseology is\nnot perhaps so refined as that of the inhabitants of the plains, but an error in this respect always proceeds from rustic plainness, and never from intentional discourtesy. They are extremely susceptible to kindness or the reverse. To be assailed with abuse is a grievous injury not to be forgotten, and is said to lead frequently to suicide. Truthfulness, honesty, and fidelity to their employers are remarkable and honourable features in their character. An English officer, after having had charge of the District for five years, records that after making due allowance for natural bias, he could scarcely recall a single instance of a wilfully false or prevaricating witness. In their dealings among themselves, the same simple honesty is exhibited. They seldom resort to written agreements, and a man's word is accepted with as little hesitation as his bond. Like all mountaineers, they are exceedingly attached to their native hills, and few consent to take service in the plains. As soldiers, they are not remarkable for daring or impetuous bravery, but they are valuable for quiet unflinching courage, a patient endurance of fatigue, and for orderly and well-conducted habits in cantonments. With all these good qualities, the worst that can be said of these people is that they are very prone to litigation, resorting to the law courts on the most trivial occasions; they are distrustful at first of strangers, and very reserved; and lastly, they are superstitious to a degree. They firmly believe in witchcraft, and one of their most constant reproaches against our rule is that there is no punishment for witches. Every misfortune or incident at all out of the common, such as the sudden death of a young man, or the cessation of milk in a buffalo, is universally ascribed to the malevolence of some demon or spirit. They have special customs of inheritance, legitimacy, etc., of their own, which differ according to the prevailing practice in various tracts, from the comparatively orthodox Hinduized population of Kangra Proper to the half-Hindu, half-Buddhist people of Lahul, and the Tibetan Buddhists of the remote tract of Seoraj in Kulu.\n\nThe description of the people given above is that of the inhabitants of Kangra Proper. In the remoter tracts of Kulu, a distinct ethnical difference shows itself in the Mongolian cast of countenance. In Seoraj, where the population are all returned as Buddhists, it is impossible to draw a line between them and the Tibetan population of the Chinese Empire.\n\nAs regards marriage customs, polyandry, which is more or less common in the Lahul and Spiti tracts, is never practised in Kangra Proper. It is not uncommon, however, for a man to sell his wife to another man, and it is stated that such agreements are sometimes executed on stamped paper, and presented at the courts for registration. Polygamy is customary among nearly all castes in Kangra, although the difficulty and expense of procuring wives acts as a consider-\nable check upon this practice. Polyandry exists more or less in L\u00e1hul, and is common among all classes in Seor\u00e1j and part of the Waz\u00edr\u00ed R\u00fapi country; but the people are now getting ashamed of it, and the custom is disappearing.\n\nA system of forced labour known as *beg\u00e1r* was in vogue in the K\u00e1ngra hills until very recently, and dates back from remote antiquity. This ancient custom is thus described by Mr. G. C. Barnes, C.S., in his Settlement Report of the District, dated 1871:\u2014\n\n\"It is well known that in the hills wheeled conveyances do not exist. The imports and exports of the country, its social wants and surplus produce, are carried entirely on the backs of camels, mules, or bullocks, the property of a class which earns its subsistence by this carrying trade. For ordinary purposes, however, for the transport, for instance, of travellers' baggage, or for conveying unwieldy articles, such as timber for public purposes, human labour alone is available. By this necessity of the country a custom has grown up possessing the sanction of great antiquity, that all classes who cultivate the soil are bound to give up, as a condition of the tenure, a portion of their labour for the exigencies of Government. Under former dynasties the people were regularly drafted and sent to work out their period of servitude wherever the Government might please to appoint. So inveterate had the practice become that even artisans and other classes unconnected with the soil were obliged to devote a portion of their time to the public service. The people, by long prescription, have come to regard this obligation as one of the normal conditions of existence; and so long as it is kept within legitimate bounds they are content to render this duty with cheerfulness and promptitude. Certain classes, such as the privileged Br\u00e1hman and Rajputs uncontaminated by the plough, were always exempt, and the burden fell principally upon the strictly agricultural tribes. Even among these races there are gradations of *beg\u00e1r* well recognised, which, for the convenience of the people, it was necessary to define. The meanest and most onerous species of forced labour was to carry loads (*pand beg\u00e1r*). Those agricultural classes that do not wear the *janeo*, or thread of caste, are all liable to this obligation. A lighter description of *beg\u00e1r* was termed *satbahak*, and consisted in carrying messages, or letters, or any parcel which could be conveyed by the hand. The fulfilment of this duty implied no degradation, and involved no great sacrifice of personal comfort; it was therefore reserved as the special province of those classes who, although occupied in agriculture, were privileged to wear the *janeo*. A third species of *beg\u00e1r* was to provide wood and grass for camp, and under former Governments this labour devolved upon *cham\u00e1rs* and other outcast tribes, whose supposed impurity alone saved them from carrying loads. The people are very tenacious of these distinctions.\"\nUnder orders from the Punjab Government, the beg\u00e1r system was abolished in Kangra Proper in March 1884. Arrangements have been made to supply the carriage required by travellers by private contract; and although some little inconvenience to the travelling public has necessarily resulted, there is no doubt that the abolition of beg\u00e1r does away with much hardship and oppression which the people formerly had to submit to on this account. In the more backward K\u00falu Sub-division, it has not been found possible as yet to entirely abolish this system of forced labour, but considerable modifications have been made in order to reduce the hardship caused by a demand for compulsory labour to a minimum. The beg\u00e1ris are paid per stage according to a liberal scale fixed by the District authorities.\n\nDivision of the People into Town and Country.\u2014Of the 681 towns and villages, or rather collections of homesteads grouped together in the Census, 90 are returned as containing less than two hundred inhabitants; 187 from two to five hundred; 177 from five hundred to a thousand; 136 from one to two thousand; 43 from two to three thousand; 32 from three to five thousand; 13 from five to ten thousand; and 3 from ten to fifteen thousand. The Census Report, however, returns only six separate places over two thousand inhabitants, as containing anything like an urban population. These are\u2014Dharm-sala, civil station and cantonment, 5322; Nurpur, 5744; Kangra, 5387; Sujanpur, 3431; Jawala Mukhi, 2424; and Haripur, 2174.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Out of a surveyed and assessed area in Kangra Proper, at the time of settlement (1865), of 1,462,363 acres, no less than 957,936 acres were returned as barren waste. Of the remainder, 413,497 acres were already under the plough, and only 90,903 acres were available for tillage. In K\u00falu, L\u00e1hul, and Spiti, the area under cultivation forms only an insignificant fraction. The Punjab Administration Report for 1883\u201384 returns the cultivated land of the whole District at 995 square miles, or 636,800 acres, out of a total area of 9069 square miles, just one-ninth of the entire surface. The cultivated area is divided into fields which are generally unenclosed, but in some parts are surrounded with hedges or stone walls about four feet high. Around the cottage of every cultivator there is a small plot of land fenced in with shrubs and trees, and cultivated like a garden. In the Kangra valley where rice cultivation prevails, the fields descend in successive terraces one below the other, and are levelled and embanked with slight ridges to retain the water. The necessity of preserving an even surface restricts the size; and immediately under the hills, where the fall is rapid, some of the plots are smaller than a billiard-table. Towards the extremities of the valley, the slope is more gradual, and the areas expand. Artificial irrigation is supplied solely by cuts (kills) from the hill streams, which\nwere returned in 1878 as irrigating 27 per cent. of the cultivated area of the whole District. The majority of these little canals have been constructed by the people themselves, and supply the fields only of the group of villages by whose labour they were made. Only a few water a wider area. These were for the most part constructed under the influence and with the aid of one or other of the native R\u00e1j\u00e1s. The management rests entirely with the people, who receive no assistance from the State. They maintain an organized staff of officers, every village supplying its representative, who patrol the watercourses to prevent theft, to stop leakage, and to distribute the water. The large proportion of do-fasli, or lands yielding two harvests in the year, is a striking feature of the K\u00e1ngra valley, and is estimated to amount on an average to nearly 50 per cent. of the entire cultivation, rising in certain special tracts to between 70 and 80 per cent.\n\nThe staple crops include wheat and barley for the r\u00e1b\u00ed or spring harvest, with rice and maize for the khar\u00edf or autumn harvest. The ripening of grain depends largely on the elevation. Rice is the principal crop of the K\u00e1ngra valley, while maize composes the ordinary food of the upland people for six months of the year. Sugar-cane covers a large and increasing area in the neighbourhood of K\u00e1ngra town. Tea cultivation, introduced experimentally by State agency shortly after the annexation of the Punjab, has taken root as an important industry in K\u00e1ngra Proper, and to a less degree in K\u00falu. In 1872-73, the District contained 28 plantations, carried on by private English capital, and producing a gross out-turn of 428,655 lbs. of manufactured tea, valued at \u00a365,000. The statistics of tea cultivation in K\u00e1ngra in 1881 are returned as follow:\u2014Number of European tea-gardens, 48, with an out-turn of 576,886 lbs. of leaf; small native gardens, 1798, with an out-turn of 385,440 lbs. Total gardens, 1846, yielding an out-turn of 962,326 lbs. valued at, say, \u00a3100,000. K\u00e1ngra tea is of good quality, and has a distinctly recognisable flavour. Potatoes, also introduced by Government, now constitute a considerable crop. In L\u00e1hul and Spiti, barley is the agricultural staple; but the former tract does not grow a sufficient quantity of grain for its own consumption, being largely supplied by importation from K\u00falu.\n\nThe average area under the principal crops for the five years 1877-78 to 1881-82 is returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 142,061 acres; rice, 124,629; maize, 144,330; barley, 63,553; gram, 17,221; sugar-cane, 10,284; maskal\u00e1i (Phaseolus mungo), 20,264; tea, 9988; cotton, 6405; and vegetables, 4265. The agricultural stock in the District in 1883 was returned as follows:\u2014Cows and bullocks, 322,966; horses, 1907; ponies, 730; donkeys, 606; sheep and goats, 392,231; pigs, 2011; camels, 89; carts, 33; and ploughs, 77,107. The total cost of the primitive agricultural implements for a small holding worked by\na single pair of oxen is estimated at less than 10s., or, including plough oxen, \u00a33. Buffaloes, which are chiefly valued for their milk, cost as much as \u00a33 each; mules, \u00a39; camels, \u00a38; ponies from \u00a31, 10s. to \u00a36; and donkeys, \u00a31. Sheep and goats have an average value of 6s. each. In a District like Kangra, where so large a proportion of the area consists of mountain-sides useless save for grazing purposes, pastoral pursuits occupy a prominent position, and rights of pasture are extensive and important. Nearly all the land is tilled by proprietors. Of a total adult male population engaged in agricultural and pastoral pursuits numbering 151,033, the Census of 1881 returned 109,327 as landowners, 29,315 as tenants, 1336 as joint cultivators, 6702 as agricultural labourers, and 4353 engaged in pastoral pursuits. Subdivision of land in Kangra Proper has reached its lowest point, and most of the cultivators follow some other trade or avocation as a means of livelihood.\n\nWages have risen largely of late years. Coolies in 1862 received at most 2 annas, or 3d. per diem; in 1882 they received from 3\u00bd to 4\u00bd annas, or from 5\u00bdd. to 6\u00bdd. Skilled labour commands from 9d. to 1s. per diem. Workmen on the tea plantations obtain, as a rule, 8s. or 9s. per month. Prices in 1873 ruled as follow:\u2014Wheat, 21 sers per rupee, or 5s. 4d. per cwt.; barley, 30 sers per rupee, or 3s. 9d. per cwt.; Indian corn, 23 sers per rupee, or 4s. 10d. per cwt.; rice, 13 sers per rupee, or 8s. 7d. per cwt. On the 1st January 1883, the prices for the same articles of produce ruled as follow:\u2014Wheat, 23 sers per rupee, or 4s. 10d. per cwt.; barley, 36 sers per rupee, or 3s. 1d. per cwt.; Indian corn, 28 sers per rupee, or 4s. per cwt.; rice, 15 sers per rupee, or 7s. 6d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce and Trade, Communications, etc.\u2014The staple articles of external trade include the agricultural products of the Districts,\u2014tea (see previous page), rice, sugar, potatoes, spices, and drugs. The return trade, which centres on Jalandhar (Jullundur) and Hoshiarpur, comprises grain, cotton, tobacco, and European piece-goods. A considerable trans-frontier trade is carried on between Kangra and Ladakh and Yarkand, and a registration station has been established at Sult\u00e1npur in the K\u00falu valley. In 1882\u201383, the value of the registered imports was \u00a349,881, and of the exports, \u00a331,291. The imports are ponies, borax, charas (an intoxicating preparation of hemp), raw silk, wool, etc. The exports include\u2014cotton piece-goods, indigo, skins, opium, metals, manufactured silk, sugar, and tea. The trade is carried on principally by L\u00e1hulis, by means of pack sheep and goats. The most important routes are over the B\u00e1ra L\u00e1cha and Rohtang passes. The principal centres of internal trade are Kangra, P\u00e1lampur, Suj\u00e1npur, T\u00edra, Jaw\u00e1la Mukhi, N\u00farpur, Gangth\u00e1, Dharm\u00e1s\u00e1la, and Narwana, all of which contain permanent markets at which the normal\ntrade of the District is carried on. Much business is also done at the annual religious fairs at Kangra and Jawala Mukhi. The Palampur fair, established by Government in 1868 with a view to fostering commerce with Central Asia, formerly drew together a small concourse of Yarkandi merchants; but the results proving unfavourable, the fair was discontinued in 1879, when it had dwindled to a merely local gathering, and has not been held since. Of manufactures, pashmina cloth and shawls are exported from Nurpur and Triloknath. Coarse woollen cloth and blankets woven by the Gaddi herdsmen, and in many towns and villages, find a ready sale in the plains to which they are exported. Soap is manufactured in the towns of Hamirpur, Dera, and Nadaun. Gold and silver jewellery and ornaments and hardware manufactures are carried on at Kangra, Sujanpur, and Tira. Enamelling in blue on a gold or silver ground forms an important industry in Kangra town, and excellently worked gold and silver tinsel-printed cloths are a speciality of the place. The iron and slate industries have been described in a previous section of this article.\n\nThe principal roads of the District are the cart-road from Jalandhar, separating into two branches at Kangra, one of which leads to Dharamsala and the other to Palampur and the tea plantations; and the cart-road from Pathankot in Gurdaspur District to Kangra. This latter will probably become the principal trade route now that the railway system has been extended to Pathankot. An unmetalled road from Pir Nigaha, on the Hoshiarpur boundary, runs to Sirkhad on the borders of Mandi territory, a distance of 41 miles. It extends through Mandi State across the Dulchi Pass to Bajaura in Kulu, and connects the trade in the north with the main trade route of the Punjab, which it joins at Phagwara, on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway in Jalandhar District. There are also lines of unmetalled roads between Dharamsala and Hamirpur, 57 miles, and thence on to Simla via Bilaspur; and from Dharamsala to Kulu, 80 miles, passing through Mandi territory. The total length of roads in the District in 1875 amounted to 714 miles, and in 1883 to 916 miles.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District staff ordinarily includes a Deputy Commissioner, 3 Assistant and 2 extra-Assistant Commissioners, besides the usual fiscal, medical, and constabulary officials. In 1868-69, the imperial revenue from Kangra District was returned at \u00a385,824. By 1872-73 the total had decreased to \u00a371,434, of which sum the land-tax contributed \u00a362,443. The only other items of importance were stamps, \u00a34824, and excise, \u00a32905. In 1882-83, the imperial revenue amounted to \u00a388,938, of which \u00a361,424 was derived from the land-tax. A small provincial and local revenue is also realized. In 1882-83, 18 magistrates exercised jurisdiction, together with 21 civil and revenue judges. The regular police force, including municipal establishments,\nconsisted in 1882 of 413 officers and men. Crime is rare, the character of the people generally being that of simple and honest mountaineers. The District jail at Dharm\u015b\u0101la contained in 1882 a daily average of 101 prisoners. Education still remains in a very backward state. The principal educational institutions are the Government District school at N\u016brpur, with 219 pupils in 1882\u201383; an aided primary school at Kailang in L\u0101hul; and the mission schools at K\u0101ngra and at Nirmand in the Seor\u0101j tract of K\u016blu. The total number of children under instruction in State-inspected schools in 1872\u201373 amounted to 2936, while in 1882\u201383 only 2506 were receiving instruction in 47 inspected schools. There are, however, a number of private uninspected schools; and the Census Report in 1881 returned 5038 boys and 94 girls as able to read and write, besides 20,865 males and 232 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. For fiscal and administrative purposes, the District is sub-divided into the 5 tahs\u012bls or Sub-divisions of K\u0101ngra, N\u016brpur, Ham\u012brpur, Dera, and K\u016blu. In 1882\u201383, the 6 municipal towns had an aggregate revenue of \u00a32038, or 1s. 9\u00bdd. per head of the population (23,003) within municipal limits.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The mean temperature of K\u0101ngra town was returned by Messrs. Schlagintweit as 52\u00b09' F. in winter, 70\u00b0 in spring, 80\u00b0 in summer, and 67\u00b07' in autumn. In 1873\u201374, the thermometer gave a mean at Dharm\u015b\u0101la of 70\u00b035' in May, 73\u00b05' in July, and 52\u00b085' in December. The average annual rainfall amounts to 126 inches an Dharm\u015b\u0101la, 76 at K\u0101ngra, 52 at Ham\u012brpur, and 108 at P\u0101lampur. The endemic diseases of the District include fever and goitre; but scurvy also prevails to a large extent. The widespread cultivation of rice, by which the whole K\u0101ngra valley is converted into a swamp, has a very prejudicial effect upon health. The total number of deaths recorded in 1882 amounted to 20,159, or 27 per thousand, of which number 11,846, or 16\u00b721 per thousand, were due to fever. The District contains 7 Government charitable dispensaries, which afforded relief in 1882 to 33,828 persons, of whom 418 were in-patients. [For further information regarding K\u0101ngra, see the Gazetteer of the K\u0101ngra District, published under the authority of the Punjab Government in 1883\u201384; the Regular Settlement Report of K\u0101ngra District between 1849 and 1852, by Mr. G. C. Barnes, C.S. (1871); the Revised Settlement Report between 1865 and 1872, by Mr. J. B. Lyall, C.S.; the Punjab Census Report for 1881; and the several Provincial Administration and Departmental Reports from 1880 to 1883.]\n\nK\u0101ngra Proper.\u2014Tract of K\u0101ngra District, Punjab, including the valleys of K\u0101ngra and Baxgah\u0101l, and lying between 31\u00b0 24' and 32\u00b0 30' N. lat., and between 75\u00b0 39' and 77\u00b0 4' E. long. It is bounded on the north by Chamb\u0101 State; on the east and south-east by K\u016blu tahs\u012bl, and by Mandi and Bil\u0101spur States; on the south-west by Hoshi-\n\u00e1rpur; and on the north-west by Gurd\u00e1spur District. K\u00e1ngra Proper contains four out of the five tahsils or Sub-divisions into which the entire District is divided, namely, K\u00e1ngra, N\u00farpur, Dera, and Ham\u00edrpur. It consists of a number of parallel mountain ranges, offshoots of the Him\u00e1layan system, divided by longitudinal valleys, and rising at the north into the colossal chain of the Dh\u00e1ola Dh\u00e1r, whose snowy peaks tower almost perpendicularly above the lesser hills at their base. The minor ridges have a general elevation of from 3000 to 4500 feet, but along the northern boundary the loftiest peaks reach a height of nearly 16,000 feet above sea-level. The average elevation of the cultivated tract is estimated at something less than 3000 feet. The mountains lie tossed about in the most irregular disorder, only resolvable by the eye of the geologist into their component systems. Ruined hill-forts crown the steeper crags, while every valley, slope, or gentle knoll teems with a dense population of industrious cultivators occupying tiny hamlets dotted over the face of the country. The large village of the Punjab plains is unknown in K\u00e1ngra. The upper glens, which run far into the heart of the snowy range, present the most exquisite views,\u2014their foreground filled with tillage and irrigated by tiny canals, while the background rises, through various gradations of tropical and alpine vegetation, to the cloud-like summits which close the prospect towards the north and east. The Beas (Bi\u00e1s), which drains the restricted K\u00e1ngra valley, here presents the appearance of a mountain torrent, broken by frequent rapids, and swelling during the rainy season into a broad expanse where every rock or island is temporarily submerged. The R\u00e1vi runs through the Bang\u00e1hal glen, while the mountains above rise to the towering height of 20,000 feet. Glaciers extend far down their sides; but a few scattered villages, inhabited by aboriginal tribes, lie ensconced among the lower depressions.\n\nThe population of K\u00e1ngra Proper consists chiefly of Hindus, whose native Katoch princes derive their descent from the ancient dynasty of J\u00e1landhar (Jullundur). (See K\u00e1ngra District.) Population (1881) 621,864, namely, males 326,321, and females 295,543. Hindus numbered 582,142; Muhammadans, 38,601; Sikhs, 731; Christians, 253; Jains, 133; and P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 4. The K\u00e1ngra valley tract contains 85 per cent. of the population of the entire District, and is thickly populated, with an average density of 224 persons per square mile, as against 52 per square mile in K\u00falu Proper, and 3 and 1 per square mile respectively in the almost uninhabited outlying tracts of Lah\u00fal and Spiti. Number of villages or hamlets, 614; number of families, 91,854. Area, 2725 square miles. Average area under cultivation in K\u00e1ngra Proper during the five years 1877-1881, 906 square miles, or 579,882 acres, the principal crops being in the same order as those given in the previous article for the District as\na whole. Practically the whole available cultivable area of Kangra Proper is actually under tillage. The modern sanitarium cantonment of Dharamsala, on the spurs of the Dhola Dhar, forms the administrative head-quarters of the entire District. But the Rajput fortress and town of Kangra was the historical capital of the tract; and the shrine of Jawala Mukhi, built over an inflammable spring, still draws together large numbers of pilgrims. Total revenue of Kangra Proper, \u00a356,302. The administrative staff consists of a Deputy Commissioner, with a Judicial Assistant and 2 Assistant Commissioners, 4 tahsildars, 2 munisifs, and 4 honorary magistrates. These officers preside over 14 civil and 12 criminal courts. Number of police circles (thana), 12; strength of regular police, 206 men; village watchmen (chaukidars), 750. For further particulars, see the preceding article, which treats of Kangra District as a whole.\n\nKangra.\u2014Tahsil of Kangra District, Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 49' 30\" and 32\u00b0 23' 30\" N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 10' and 76\u00b0 43' E. long., and forming a part of Kangra Proper. Area, 1065 square miles. Population in 1868, 211,165; in 1881, 218,588, namely, males 114,801, and females 103,787. Hindus number 207,252; Muhammadans, 10,976; Sikhs, 112; Christians, 244; and Parsis, 4. Number of villages or hamlets, 232; houses, 32,698; number of families, 41,266. The average area under cultivation for the five years 1877-1881 was 175,719, the area under the principal crops being\u2014rice, 71,426 acres; wheat, 50,521; Indian corn, 11,915; barley, 11,589; and sugar-cane, 3390 acres. Revenue of the tahsil, \u00a323,503. The administrative staff consists of a Deputy Commissioner, Judicial Assistant, 2 Assistant Commissioners, a tahsildar, and 2 munisifs. These officers preside over 7 civil and 5 criminal courts. Number of police circles (thana), 3; strength of regular police, 59 men; village watchmen (chaukidars), 195.\n\nKangra.\u2014Town and municipality of Kangra District, Punjab; formerly the capital of a considerable Katoch State. Lat. 32\u00b0 5' 14\" N., long. 76\u00b0 17' 46\" E. The town, anciently known as Nagarkot, occupies both slopes of a hill, overlooking the Banganga torrent. The older portion covers the southern declivity, while the suburb of Bhawan and the famous temple of Devi lie upon the northern slope. The fort, to which alone in strictness the name of Kangra belongs, crowns a precipitous rock, rising sheer above the Banganga, and dominating the whole surrounding valley, of which from time immemorial it has formed the key. Once considered impregnable, it is open to attack from so many neighbouring eminences as to offer little opportunity of defence against modern artillery. The Katoch princes ruled the Kangra valley from prehistoric times till the advent of the British. During the Mughal period, the town apparently possessed a far larger population than at the present\nday; and it was held by the last Muhammadan governor long after he had become completely isolated from the remainder of the Delhi Empire. (See Kangra District.) The temple of Devi, twice plundered by the Musalmans, ranks among the oldest and most wealthy shrines in India. After the British annexation, the District head-quarters were originally fixed at Kangra; but since their removal to Dharamsala in 1855 the town has rapidly sunk into insignificance. Population in 1868, 6448; in 1881, 5387. Classified according to religion, the population in the latter year comprised\u2014Hindus, 4454; Muhammadans, 872; Sikhs, 9; and 'others,' 52. Number of houses, 928. Municipal income (1882), \u00a3472, or an average of 1s. 9d. per head. The town is the centre of local trade, but the manufacture of country cloth which was formerly carried on has become almost extinct. Kangra is noted for its jewellery work, and its excellent blue enamel. The public buildings consist of a circuit-house, tahsil, police station, charitable dispensary, post-office, school-house, staging bungalow, sardai. The fort is garrisoned by a detachment of the Gurkha regiment stationed at Dhamsala, under the command of a European officer. Kangra is a station of the Church Missionary Society, one of whose missionaries generally resides here.\n\nKangundi.\u2014Zamindari or estate in North Arcot District, Madras Presidency. The area is 213 square miles. Population (1881) 45,184, namely, 22,475 males and 22,709 females, dwelling in 8682 houses, scattered through 321 villages. Hindus numbered 43,739; Muhammadans, 1437; and Christians, 8. The estate lies in the south-west extremity of the District; bounded on the north-west by Mysore State, north-east by Palmaner taluk, south and south-east by Salem District; greatest length, 25 miles; greatest breadth, 18 miles. The zamindar divides his country into three parts\u2014the Bailu Sima or open country of the north-west, the Chettu Sima or wooded country of the centre, and the Kanama Kinda Sima or below-ghat country of the south-east.\n\nThe estate has been long in the possession of the present zamindar's family, and is probably a creation of the Vijayanagar dynasty, whose princes settled in this neighbourhood. Haidar Ali threw one of the subsequent palegars into jail at Seringapatam; and Tipu shortly after placed a garrison in the town of Kangundi. The Company restored the rightful heirs in 1794.\n\nOf the total area, 8000 acres are reported to be under wet-crop cultivation, and 32,000 acres under dry; 30,000 acres are cultivable waste, and 150,000 uncultivable. The land system is for the zamindar to lease out his villages to one or more persons jointly for short terms of years, and the lessees make their own terms with the raya, varying the demand from year to year. The well-to-do villagers are generally the lessees, and care little for the interests of the poorer raya. The result\nis a backward condition among the mass of the people. Irrigation is carried on by tanks, which are, as a rule, large and excellently built. Wells are infrequent, and spring channels unknown. The soil is a gravelly loam of inferior quality. Lime and iron are found, but the iron is not worked. There is said to be 100 square miles of auriferous country, but nothing has been done to explore the ground, although gold-mining works are carried on near the border. Jaggery or raw sugar is made, but the general occupation is agriculture. Kangundi cattle were once famous. The estate is in railway communication with the other parts of the Presidency through the station, situated at Kuppam, of the Bangalore branch of the south-west line of the Madras Railway. Kuppam is the only place in the estate with over 2000 inhabitants. Its population is 2874, that of Kangundi town being 703. The peshkash (revenue) to Government is \u00a32300 per annum. The general elevation of the country is about 2000 feet above sea-level. The villages are nearly all stockaded, and the whole tract is more primitive in its aspect than the surrounding District.\n\n**Kangundi.**\u2014Town in Kangundi zamind\u00e1ri, North Arcot District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 703; number of houses, 143. The village, once the chief place in the neighbourhood, is now depopulated by fever, cholera, and the effects of the famine of 1876\u201378. It lies at the base of a precipitous hill crowned with the ruins of a fort, which must have been a place of great strength, much care having been expended in the fortifications. The hill is ascended by a flight of steps. The zamind\u00e1r's palace is an imposing pile of buildings.\n\n**Kan-gyi-daung.**\u2014Head-quarters town of Th\u00ed-kwin township, Bassein District, Irawadi Division, British Burma; situated in lat. 16\u00b0 54\u2032 30\u2033 N., long. 64\u00b0 58\u2032 E., on the right bank of the Dag\u00e1 river, about 15 miles from its junction with the Bassein. Population (1876) 2351; (1881) 2081, chiefly engaged in agriculture; number of houses, 295. Local revenue, \u00a3100; excise other than tari, \u00a3281. Court-house and police-station.\n\n**Kanh\u00e1n.**\u2014River of the Central Provinces; rising in lat. 21\u00b0 52\u2032 N., long. 78\u00b0 39\u2032 E., in the S\u00e1tpura Hills, Chhindw\u00e1r\u00e1 District; winds in a south-easterly direction through a series of small hills in the Ghargajgarh forests, four miles south of the ruined fort of Deogarh; receives the J\u00e1m below Lodhikher\u00e1; and joins the Pench just above Kamthi, where a magnificent stone bridge spans the river, constructed at a cost of \u00a380,000. The united stream then flows on until it falls into the Waingang\u00e1 (lat. 21\u00b0 5\u2032 N., long. 79\u00b0 40\u2032 E.) below Bhand\u00e1ra, about 140 miles from the source of the Kanh\u00e1n.\n\n**Kanharg\u00e1on.**\u2014A small estate or zamind\u00e1ri in Bhand\u00e1ra District, Central Provinces; consisting of a single village, with an area of 1404 acres. Around the village site are some very fine trees,\u2014mango, pip\u00e1l,\ntamarind, and date-palm,\u2014including a magnificent banyan tree of great age, and covering a considerable area.\n\n**Kanheri.**\u2014A barren hill in Bhandar\u00e1 District, Central Provinces, about 18 miles south-east of Bhandar\u00e1 town; rising about 300 feet above the plain. Yields good building stone, besides hones, and white soft stone for pottery.\n\n**Kanigiri.**\u2014T\u00e1luk in Nellore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 15\u00b0 1' to 15\u00b0 32' N., long. 79\u00b0 9' to 79\u00b0 44' E. Area, 726 square miles. Population (1881) 108,761, namely, 55,422 males and 53,339 females, dwelling in 188 villages, containing 20,561 houses. Hindus numbered 98,804; Muhammadans, 5573; and Christians, 4384. The most barren and unfruitful t\u00e1luk in Nellore. It is intersected by two streams, the Maneru and the Paleru; but little pure water is to be had. Herds of goats browse over a rocky plain covered with thin scrub jungle. Palmyra trees grow among the sandhills that dot the north-west corner over a considerable area; and drunkenness caused by the palmyra toddy is prevalent among all classes. In 1883, there were in the t\u00e1luk 2 criminal courts; police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 12; regular police, 78 men; village watch (chaukiddrs), 19. Land revenue, \u00a34891.\n\n**Kanigiri.**\u2014Town and fort in Kanigiri t\u00e1luk of Nellore District, Madras. Lat. 15\u00b0 23' N., long. 79\u00b0 32' E. Population (1881) 2869, namely, 1415 males and 1454 females, dwelling in 635 houses. Hindus numbered 2302; Muhammadans, 482; and Christians, 85. In the neighbourhood is a remarkable hill, which forms a striking feature in the landscape for many miles round. On its summit, about 1500 feet above sea-level, is a table-land of about a square mile, where tradition says a town once stood. The hill was fortified, and was formerly a place of great strength. The remains of some of the batteries still exist. About the 10th century this part of the country was taken by Kaketa Rudrudu of the Gajapathi family, who had the seat of their government at Cuttack. His son built the town of Kanigiri, and fortified the hill. About the 16th century it was captured by Krishna R\u00e1ya. It played a conspicuous part in local feuds till it was taken, and the buildings destroyed by Haidar Al\u00ed.\n\n**Kanjarapalli** ('Caguarapalli' of Bartolomeo).\u2014Town in Changuacheri District, Travancore State, Madras Presidency. Lat. 9\u00b0 4' 30\" N., long. 76\u00b0 35' 20\" E. Population about 2000. A trading town on the main road from Kotayam to Madura, through Pirmaid and G\u00fadalur. Situated at the foot of the gh\u00e1t or pass, and inhabited chiefly by Muhammadan traders. Fra Paolino di S. Bartolomeo mentions it specially as having dealings across the gh\u00e1t with Madura.\n\n**Kanjarda.**\u2014Petty State of the Gohilw\u00e1r Sub-division of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency; consisting of 1 village, Kanjarda. Population\nSituated at the foot of the Bh\u00e1dwo hill, about eight miles to the south-west of P\u00e1lit\u00e1na. The revenue in 1876 was estimated at \u00a3250; tribute of \u00a312, 16s. is paid to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda.\n\nKanj\u00ed\u00e1.\u2014Ancient town in a tract of same name, on the northern frontier of S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) District, Central Provinces. Lat. 24\u00b0 23' 30\" N., long. 78\u00b0 15' E. Its first recorded ruler was a Bundela chief named Debi Singh, whose son Sh\u00e1hj\u00ed built the fort which stands on a hill to the south of the town. It is square, with a tower at each corner, and encloses about 2 acres, nearly covered with ruined buildings. In 1726, Sh\u00e1hj\u00ed's descendant, Vikram\u00e1diya, was expelled by Hasan-ull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, Naw\u00e1b of Kurw\u00e1i, and took refuge at Pipr\u00e1si, a small village in the extreme north of the Kanj\u00ed\u00e1 tract, where his descendant, Amrit Singh, was living in 1870 on a rent-free estate of five villages. In 1758, the Peshw\u00e1's army drove out the Naw\u00e1b of Kurw\u00e1i, and the Peshw\u00e1 conferred the tract on one of his officers, named Khandar\u00e1o Trimbak. His successor, R\u00e1mch\u00e1ndra Ball\u00e1l (otherwise R\u00e1m Bh\u00e1ri), on the cession of S\u00e1g\u00e1r (Saugor) by the Peshw\u00e1 in 1818, gave up Kanj\u00ed\u00e1 and Mal-h\u00e1rgarh, a neighbouring tract, receiving in lieu thereof the estate of Itaw\u00e1. In the same year the British made over Kanj\u00ed\u00e1 to Sindhia, who held it until the exchange of territory in 186c, when it was incorporated with S\u00e1g\u00e1r District. In 1857, a party of Bundelas from the adjoining Native States turned out Sindhia's officer, and forcibly set up Amrit Singh as their ruler. After a few days he escaped from the unwelcome dignity; but the Bundelas plundered the place, and only decamped eight months later on hearing of the approach of Sir Hugh Rose. The tract suffered under native rule from fiscal oppression, but has improved since the new settlement of the land revenue. A market is held every Tuesday. Police outpost station.\n\nKanjikovil.\u2014Town in Erod t\u00e1luk, Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 11\u00b0 22' N., long. 77\u00b0 38' 20\" E. Population (1871) 5300; (1881) 4430, occupying 1018 houses. Hindus number 4393; Muhammadans, 3; and Christians, 34.\n\nK\u00e1nk\u00e1nhalli.\u2014T\u00e1luk in Bangalore District, Mysore State, Southern India.

The most important articles of trade are grain and opium from\nCentral India, and tobacco from Gujer\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t). Besides supplying a considerable local demand, Kapadwanj goods are exported to the P\u00e1nch Mah\u00e1ls, B\u00e1lasinor territory, and Central India. Near the walls are the ruins of an ancient town. The neighbourhood was the scene of some hard-fought battles during the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 ascendency. It was exchanged for Bij\u00e1pur in 1817. Kapadwanj derives its importance as lying on one of the main trade routes between Central India and the coast. The principal objects of interest in the town are a fine reservoir with a well in the centre, and an arch in the Ch\u00e1lukya (1000\u20131300) style of architecture. A sacred pool, with healing qualities attributed to it by tradition, is inside the walls. South of the pool is an underground temple to Mah\u00e1deo, never properly explored. Of modern buildings, that of most note is a Jain temple; the interior is richly ornamented with marble pillars, and a marble pavement inlaid with delicacy and taste.

The rocks of the K\u00e1parg\u00e1di range are all of a schistose character, running into gneiss. On the north of the ridge are copper-bearing rocks, extending for a distance of 80 miles. These copper beds were formerly worked by European companies, but on too expensive a scale to yield a profit. The enterprise was abandoned in 1864, and the company's buildings and machinery were seized by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of D\u00e1lbh\u00fam for the mining rent of the ground. It has not since been resumed.\n\nK\u00e1pila.\u2014Ancient city, supposed by General Cunningham to have been where the village of Nagar-Khas in Gorakhpur District now stands.

Hindus numbered 5026, and Muhammadans 41. Ferry across the God\u00e1vari, 21 miles above Yanam in French territory.\n\nKapili (Kopili).\u2014River in the Province of Assam, rising in the Jaintia Hills in lat. 25\u00b0 5\u2032 N., and long. 92\u00b0 31\u2032 E., and flowing northwards into Nowgong (Naug\u00e1on) District. For a long distance it forms\nthe boundary between the Jaintia and the North Cachar Hills, and it ultimately falls into the Kalang, an offshoot of the Brahmaputra at J\u00e1gi. Lat. $26^\\circ 13'$ N., long. $92^\\circ 35'$ E. Its chief tributaries are the Diying and the Jamuna, which join it on its right bank from North Cachar and the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills. The banks are rocky throughout. The Kapili is navigable in the plains by boats of 4 tons burthen during the greater part of the year, but shortly before its exit from the hills its course is interrupted by a rocky barrier over which the stream is precipitated in a fine waterfall. This renders its upper course impassable by boats. A hot spring exists a few miles above the falls.\n\nKapilmuni.\u2014Village in Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal; situated on the bank of the Kabadak river, 5 or 6 miles below T\u00e1l\u00e1. Lat. $22^\\circ 41' 30''$ N., long. $89^\\circ 21'$ E. It has a permanent b\u00e1z\u00e1r and a bi-weekly market, but is not a place of much trade. The village takes its name from a Hindu sage (muni) named Kapila, not the great Kapila who, according to Hindu mythology, destroyed the sons of King S\u00e1gar, but a celebrated devotee, who established his abode here in ancient times, and set up the idol Kapilesw\u00e1ri, which is still worshipped. A grand fair (mel\u00e1) is annually held here in honour of the goddess in March, on the day of the Baruni bathing festival. According to local belief, the Kabadak at this place acquires for that day the sanctifying influences of Ganges water\u2014a result due to the virtues of Kapilmuni. The tomb of a Muhammadan saint, Jafar \u00c1li, has also become a place of pilgrimage for devout Musalm\u00e1ns. The building is in charge of Muhammadan fak\u00edrs, who hold lands rent-free for its maintenance.\n\nKapini (Kabbani, Kapila).\u2014Tributary of the K\u00e1ver\u00ed (Cauvery) river, Southern India; rises in the Western Gh\u00e1ts, and, after flowing in an easterly direction across the middle of Mysore District, falls into the K\u00e1ver\u00ed near Narsipur. The confluence is a spot of great sanctity. The Kapini has two tributaries from the south, the Nugu and the Gundal. A perennial river, averaging from 150 to 200 yards in width, and during the dry season bringing down a volume of water not less than that of the K\u00e1ver\u00ed. Scarcely used for purposes of irrigation.\n\nKapurthala.\u2014Native State under the political superintendence of the Government of the Punjab, lying between $31^\\circ 9'$ and $31^\\circ 39' 30''$ N. lat., and between $75^\\circ 3' 15''$ and $75^\\circ 38' 30''$ E. long. Area, 620 square miles. Population (1881) 252,617; average density of population, 420 persons per square mile.\n\nThe ancestors of the chief of Kap\u00farthala at one time held possessions both in the cis- and trans-Sutlej, and also in the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b. In the latter lies the village of Ahlu, whence the family springs, and from which it takes the name of Ahluw\u00e1lia. The scattered possessions in the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b were gained by the sword in 1780, and were the first acquisitions\nmade by Sard\u00e1r Jassa Singh, the founder of the family. Of the cis-Sutlej possessions, some were conquered by Sard\u00e1r Jassa Singh, and others were granted to him by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranj\u00edt Singh prior to September 1808.\n\nBy a treaty made in 1809, the Sard\u00e1r of Kap\u00farthala pledged himself to furnish supplies to British troops moving through or cantoned in his cis-Sutlej territory; and by declaration in 1809 he was bound to join the British standard with his followers during war. In 1826, the Sard\u00e1r, Fateh Singh, fled to the cis-Sutlej States for the protection of the British Government against the aggressions of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Ranj\u00edt Singh. This was accorded; but in the first Sikh war the Kap\u00farthala troops fought against the British at Al\u00edw\u00e1l, and, in consequence of these hostilities and of the failure of the chief, Sard\u00e1r Nih\u00e1l Singh, son of Sard\u00e1r Fateh Singh, to furnish supplies from his cis-Sutlej estates to the British army, these estates were confiscated. When the J\u00e1landhar (Jullundur) Do\u00e1b came under the dominion of the British Government in 1846, the trans-Sutlej estates were maintained in the independent possession of the Ahluw\u00e1lia chieftain, conditional on his paying a commutation in cash of the service engagements by which he had previously been bound to the Government of Ranj\u00edt Singh. The Bar\u00ed Do\u00e1b estates have been released to the head of the house in perpetuity, the civil and police jurisdiction remaining in the hands of the British authorities.\n\nIn 1849, Sard\u00e1r Nih\u00e1l Singh was created a R\u00e1j\u00e1. He died in September 1852, and was succeeded by his son, Randh\u00edr Singh. During the Mutiny in 1857, the forces of Randh\u00edr Singh, who never hesitated or wavered in his loyalty, strengthened our hold upon the J\u00e1landhar Do\u00e1b; and afterwards, in 1858, the chief led a contingent to Oudh, which did good service in the field. He was well rewarded; and among other concessions obtained the grant in perpetuity of the estates of Baundi, Bithauli, and Akona in Oudh, which yield at present a gross annual revenue of about \u00a380,000. In these estates the R\u00e1j\u00e1 exercises no sovereign powers, though in Oudh he is, to mark his superiority over the ordinary t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs, to be addressed as R\u00e1j\u00e1-i-R\u00e1j\u00e1g\u00e1n. This title was made applicable to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 in Oudh only, and not in the Punjab. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Randh\u00edr Singh died at Aden on his way to England in 1870, and was succeeded by his son, Kharrak Singh. The present R\u00e1j\u00e1, Jagatjit Singh, son of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Kharrak Singh, is a minor, who succeeded in September 1877. The chiefs of Kap\u00farthala are Sikhs of the Kal\u00e1l tribe. The area of the Punjab State is 620 square miles; that of the Oudh estates, 700 square miles. The population of the estates in 1881 amounted to 249,301 in Oudh, and 252,617 in the Punjab.\n\nThe Kap\u00farthala State, with its area of 620 square miles, contains 4 towns and 613 villages; 37,633 houses; and 62,047 families. Total\npopulation (1881) 252,617, namely, males 138,638, and females 113,979; average density of population, 407 persons per square mile; persons per village, 409; inmates per house, 6\u00b77. Classified according to religion, the population consists of\u2014Muhammadans, 142,174; Hindus, 82,900; Sikhs, 26,493; Jains, 214; Christians, 35; and Buddhist, 1.\n\nThe revenue of the State is about \u00a3100,000, but is subject to a charge of \u00a313,100, payable to the British Government as commutation for military services, and \u00a36000 per annum to Sard\u00e1rs Bikrama Singh and Suchet Singh, brothers of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Randh\u00edr Singh. The Oudh estates are estimated to yield about \u00a380,000 in addition. The military forces consist of 4 fort guns, 9 field guns, 186 cavalry, 926 infantry, and 303 police. The principal products of the State are sugar-cane, cotton, wheat, maize, and tobacco. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 has the right of adoption, and is entitled to a salute of 11 guns. The three principal towns in the State are Kapurthala, the capital, with a population of 15,237; Phagwara, population 10,627; and Sultanpur, population 8217.\n\nKapurthala.\u2014Chief town of Kapurthala State, Punjab; situated in lat. 31\u00b0 23' N., and long. 75\u00b0 25' E., 8 miles from the left bank of the river Beas (Bi\u00e1s). Population in 1881, 15,237, namely, Muhammadans, 8926; Hindus, 5351; Sikhs, 884; Jains, 42; and 'others,' 34. Number of houses, 3081. The town is connected by metalled roads with J\u00e1landhar, 11 miles distant, with the Kart\u00e1rpur Station of the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway, 7\u00bd miles distant, and with Sultanpur, 16 miles distant. Kapurthala has been the capital of the Ahluw\u00e1lia chiefs since its conquest by Sard\u00e1r Jassa Singh in 1780.\n\nKara.\u2014Town in Sir\u00e1thu tahsil, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces.\u2014See Karra.\n\nKarachi (Kurrachee).\u2014District in the Province of Sind, Bombay Presidency; lies between 23\u00b0 34' and 26\u00b0 57' N. lat., and between 66\u00b0 41' 30\" and 68\u00b0 49' E. long. Karachi District is bounded on the north by Shik\u00e1rpur; on the east by the Indus and Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyderabad); on the south by the sea and the Kori river; and on the west by the sea and Baluchist\u00e1n or the territories of the Kh\u00e1n of Khel\u00e1t (Kal\u00e1t), the river Hab (Habb) forming for a considerable distance the line of demarcation. The greatest length of the District from north to south is 200 miles, and its greatest breadth from east to west 110 miles. Area, 14,115 square miles, or 11\u00b74 per cent. of the British Districts of the Bombay Presidency, or 5\u00b72 per cent. of the entire area, British and feudatory. Population (1881) 478,688 persons. The administrative head-quarters are at the city of Karachi (Kurrachee).\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Karachi District, an immense tract of land stretching from the mouth of the Indus to the Baluchi boundary,\ndiffers considerably in appearance from the general level of the Province of Sind by its possession of a hilly western region, lying in the Sub-divisions of Kohist\u00e1n and Kar\u00e1chi. Numerous lateral ranges of considerable height here push forward into the plain from the Kirthar, or Hala, Mountains, and diversify the usually monotonous aspect of the arid surface by their spurs and offshoots. From this lofty and barren tract, intersected by deep and wide valleys, the general aspect of the country, as it runs south-eastward in a vast sloping plain, becomes more and more level, until in the extreme south the Indus Delta presents a broad expanse of low, flat, and unpicturesque alluvium, stretching away to the horizon in one unbroken sheet, only varied by the numerous creeks communicating with the ocean. Large forests of bab\u00fal and other trees fringe the river banks, and impart a somewhat fresher appearance to the otherwise dreary landscape. Elsewhere, however, the features of the Sind Delta stand unrelieved in their naked monotony.\n\nThe Indus, the Great River of Sind, takes its rise in an unexplored region beyond British India, on the northern slopes of the sacred Kail\u00e1s mountain, at an elevation of 16,000 feet above sea-level, in lat. 32\u00b0 N., long. 81\u00b0 E. It enters British territory in the Punjab, near Derbend, at the western base of the Mah\u00e1ban mountain, in lat. 34\u00b0 25' N., and long. 72\u00b0 51' E. At a distance of 812 miles from its source, it becomes navigable at Attock, in R\u00e1wal Pindi District, and just above Mith\u00e1nkot, in Der\u00e1 Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n District, it receives the accumulated waters of the Sutlej, Jehlam (Jhelum), Chen\u00e1b, R\u00e1vi, and Beas (Bi\u00e1s), under the name of the Panjnad. It enters Sind from the north, near Kashmor town, in lat. 28\u00b0 26' N., and long. 69\u00b0 47' E., and flowing in a general southerly direction touches Kar\u00e1chi District, and forms the boundary between Kar\u00e1chi and Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d as far as Jerruck town, whence it flows entirely through Kar\u00e1chi District, and throwing off numerous branches, falls into the sea by several mouths, extending along a coast-line of upwards of 125 miles.\n\nThe delta of the Indus comprises an area of from 2000 to 3000 square miles, of an almost uniform level, but with a submerged belt fringing the coast of an average breadth of twenty miles. Unlike the densely wooded delta of the Ganges, that of the Indus is almost entirely destitute of timber. The river is continually changing its current, particularly in its lower courses, and the different mouths are constantly shifting. In the early part of the century, the two great arms of the river were the Baghi\u00e1r and the Sit\u00e1, both of which were then navigable by large vessels, but in 1837 the former was found to be quite deserted by the river. Prior to 1819, the town of Sh\u00e1hbandar (King's port), on the Bag\u00e1na (or Mal) branch, was an important naval station of the Kalhora princes, and ships of war were\nstationed there. This town is now ten miles inland from the nearest point of the river. The principal mouth of the Indus at present (1884) is the Haj\u00e1mro branch. On the eastern side of the entrance is a large beacon 95 feet high, visible 25 miles to seaward, and two pilot boats are stationed inside the bar. In 1845, the Haj\u00e1mro branch was so small as only to be suited for the passage of small boats at flood-tide.\n\nThe Indus was first navigated by steamers in 1835. In 1839, two steamers were employed for military purposes when Lord Keane's army landed in Sind en route to Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n; and in 1842 steam vessels took an important part in the conquest of the Province. After annexation, a Government navy steam flotilla was maintained on the Indus, with its head-quarters at Kotr\u00ed, mainly for the transport of troops, treasure, and Government stores between Kar\u00e1chi and M\u00falt\u00e1n. The Government flotilla was broken up in 1859, and several of its steamers and stock made over to a company worked in conjunction with the railway then in construction between Kar\u00e1chi and Kotr\u00ed. On the completion of the Sind railway system, and its connection with the general railway system of India, the necessity for a steam flotilla on the Indus ceased, and it has recently been broken up, and the vessels sold. For a general account of the Indus, its navigation and irrigation capabilities, etc., see the articles Indus River and Sind Province.\n\nThe only other river of any importance in Kar\u00e1chi District is the Hab, forming the western boundary between Sind and Baluch\u00edst\u00e1n. A few minor torrents take their rise among the western hills, but consist of dry watercourses during the greater portion of the year, only inundated on a few rare occasions, when heavy rains fall on the higher ranges, in which they have their sources. The Manchhar Lake, in Sehw\u00e1n Sub-division, forms the only considerable sheet of water in any part of Sind. The hot springs of Pir Mangho, situated about six or seven miles north of Kar\u00e1chi town, among some very barren and rocky hills, attract many visitors on account of their picturesque surroundings. They gush up from a clump of date trees, which covers the extremity of a craggy limestone knoll, in a pretty valley enclosed by considerable heights. A swamp close by is famous for its immense number of crocodiles, which rank among the chief sights of Kar\u00e1chi. Hundreds of these monsters bask lazily in the sun, by the side of a green, slimy, stagnant pool, or move sluggishly about in search of food. A mosque crowns the summit of a neighbouring crag, with a neat white cupola and slender minarets.\n\nThe fauna include the leopard, hy\u00e6na, wolf, jackal, fox, bear, antelope, and wild sheep. Among birds, vultures, grey pigeon, partridge, and quail are common. Reptiles of various kinds abound, especially in Kohist\u00e1n.\nHistory.\u2014From the early Arab invasions of Sind in the beginning of the eighth century A.D. down to the time (1839) when Karachi town was taken by the British, the District had experienced the vicissitudes of seven dynasties or systems of administration. These were, in order of succession,\u2014those of the early invaders, of Mahmud of Ghazni and his commanders, of the Sammas from Cutch, of the Arghun family, of the Mughals, of the Kalhora princes, and of the Talpur Mirs. The ancient town of Sehw\u00e1n contains the ruins of a fort of great antiquity. Local tradition ascribes its origin to Alexander the Great, who sailed down the Indus from the country of the Malli (Mult\u00e1n), and despatched Nearchus, doubtless from some point (suggested to be at Tatta) in the present District, to explore the Persian Gulf. It is, however, more generally identified with the Sindhomani existing in the time of Alexander. In later times it was known as Sewast\u00e1n. The town already possessed considerable importance when Muhammad Kasim Sakif, the first Musalm\u00e1n invader of Sind, obtained its submission about 713 A.D., after his conquest of Nerankot, the modern Haidarabad. The date 713 marks the first Arab invasion of the District. Between 1019 and 1026 the invasions of Mahmud of Ghazni took place, and in 1351 the Samma tribe from Cutch (Kachchh) settled first at Sehw\u00e1n and afterwards at Tatta. Close under the Makli Hills stood Samui, the capital of the Samma dynasty of princes, originally a Hindu or Buddhist race, who maintained their independence of the Muhammadan power from 1351 to 1521. Converted to the faith of Islam about the close of the 14th century, they still continued to retain their practical autonomy, in spite of a nominal allegiance tendered to Firoz Tughlak of Delhi; and the town of Tatta, where they generally resided, became in after years the chief centre of population and commerce for the whole of Sind.\n\nIn 1521, Shah Beg, founder of the Arghun dynasty, completely defeated the last Samma prince, and established his own claim to the sovereignty of the lower Indus valley. After a continuance of only thirty-four years, however, the Arghun line became extinct in the person of Shah Husain, son of the founder, who died childless in 1554. Mirza Jani Beg, the last local ruler of Tatta, was defeated by an army of the Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1592; and the District, together with the rest of Sind, became incorporated with the Mult\u00e1n (Mooltan) subah in the imperial organization of the country. 'The country of Tatta,' however, was made over to Jani Beg, who entered the Mughal service after his defeat, and compromised for his independence by accepting his former territories in jagir. Continued struggles for the governorship of Tatta led Jahangir to abolish the hereditary viceroyalty, and to appoint instead special lieutenants holding office during the imperial pleasure. The town of Karachi itself appears to have attained little importance\neither under the native dynasties or the Mughal administration. Its rise into notice began with the period of the T\u00e1lpur M\u00edrs, who succeeded the Kalhora princes in 1793 (see Haidarabad). They first recognised the value of the harbour for commerce. The capture of the Manora fort in 1839 put the British in possession of the town. The District was ceded in November 1842. Kar\u00e1chi town grew rapidly under the new administration, and became the principal port of North-Western India. Kar\u00e1chi District, as at first constituted, did not embrace so wide an area as at present; but in 1861, a portion of the Indus Delta, composing the present Sh\u00e1hbandar Sub-division, was taken from Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, and incorporated with this District.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1872 returned the population of Kar\u00e1chi District at 426,722. The total number of inhabitants in the District on 17th February 1881 amounted to 478,688 persons, scattered over an area of 14,115 square miles, inhabiting an aggregate of 723 towns and villages, and dwelling in 87,059 houses. In the nine years ending 1881, there has thus been an increase of 51,966, or 12\u00b717 per cent. From the data given by the Census of 1881, the following averages may be deduced:\u2014Persons per square mile, 33\u00b791; villages per square mile, 0\u00b705; persons per village, 538; and per town, 30,437. Classified according to sex, there were \u2014 males, 265,988; females, 212,700; proportion of males, 55\u00b75 per cent. Classified according to age, there were, under 15 years\u2014105,823 boys, 86,252 girls; total children, 192,075, or 40\u00b71 per cent. As regards religious distinctions, Kar\u00e1chi is an essentially Muhammadan District, the Census showing a total of 390,667 Musalm\u00e1ns, as against 68,975 Hindus. The Muhammadans include 382,811 Sunnis, 6967 Shi\u00e1s, 52 Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, and 237 \u2018other\u2019 Muhammadans. Divided into tribes, there are 85,314 Bal\u00fach\u00eds, 2686 Path\u00e1ns, 7314 Sayyids, 8092 Shaikhs, 246,760 Sindhis, and 39,901 \u2018other\u2019 Muhammadans. There are 10,819 Sikhs, mostly trading in the towns. The Hindu population embraces 3883 Br\u00e1hmans, 359 R\u00e1jputs, 43,869 Loh\u00e1nas, and 20,864 \u2018other\u2019 Hindus; 3050 are returned as aboriginal tribes. The Christian population includes the large number of 4674 persons (including the garrison); while 9 Jains, 969 P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 106 Jews, 3 Buddhists, and 16 Brahmos complete the total.\n\nAs regards occupation, the male population is divided into six main groups:\u2014(1) Professional class, including State officials of every kind and the learned professions, 4917; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 6516; (3) commercial class, including bankers, merchants, carriers, etc., 14,220; (4) agricultural and pastoral class, including gardeners, 83,390; (5) industrial class, including all manufacturers and artisans, 29,830; (6) indefinite and non-productive class, comprising general labourers, male children, and persons of unspecified occupation, 127,115.\nOf the 723 towns and villages in the District, 227 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 242 between two and five hundred; 166 between five hundred and one thousand; 65 between one and two thousand; 12 between two and three thousand; 4 between three and five thousand; 6 between five and ten thousand; and 1 over fifty thousand. The following are the chief towns:\u2014Karachi, 73,560; Kotri, 8922; Sehwan, 4524; Bubak, 2836; Dadu, 2270; Tatta, 8830; Keti-Bandar, 2141; Manjhand, 2654; and Mirpur Batoro, 3102.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014In the Karachi Sub-division, cultivation exists only on a few isolated spots, and depends upon wells, springs, or natural rainfall. Here the chief crops are jo\u00e1r, bajra, barley, and sugar-cane, grown chiefly on the Malir plain, distant from Karachi city some 12 miles, and easily accessible by rail. In Jerruck and Shahbandar, where numerous creeks and channels intersect the alluvial flats, rice forms the staple crop; but wheat, sugar-cane, millets, cotton, and tobacco are also grown. The Western Nara Canal supplies the means of irrigation in Sehw\u00e1n Sub-division. In the barren hills of Kohistan, agriculture is practically unknown; and the nomad population devotes itself almost entirely to grazing cattle in the southern plains, where abundance of forage springs up spontaneously after every fall of rain. The harvest seasons recognised in the District are three in number\u2014kharif, sown in May or June, and reaped in October, November, or December; rabi, sown in November or December, and reaped in March or April; and adhiwa, sown in January, and reaped in March.\n\nIn 1882\u201383, out of the 9,033,600 acres in the District, only 594,633 acres were cultivated land bearing assessment and in occupation; 65,584 acres were fallow; while 209,805 acres, though cultivable and assessed, were not in occupation. Irrigation is afforded by upwards of 1350 miles of natural and artificial water channels. Of the area cropped, 43,165 acres were under wheat, 18,023 under barley, 146,581 under rice, 109,171 under millets (jo\u00e1r and bajra), 21,896 under other cereals, 5548 under garden produce, 1366 under sugar-cane, 40,618 under oil-seeds, 700 acres under cotton, 78 under other fibres, 4918 under pulse, 407 under tobacco, and 24,856 under other products, giving a total of 417,327 acres, of which 17,557 acres were twice cropped. In regard to cotton, a decrease in the average out-turn took place in 1882\u201383. The prices of agricultural produce ruling during 1882 were, per maund of 82 lbs., as follows:\u2014Wheat, 6s. 8\u00bdd.; barley, 3s. 8\u00bcd.; best rice, 8s. 2d.; common rice, 4s. 9\u00bdd.; millet, from 3s. 6d. to 4s. 4d.; gram, 4s. 5\u00bdd.; salt, 4s. 6\u00bdd.; flour, 9s. 4\u00bed.; dal, 7s.; ghi, \u00a32, 19s. 2\u00bed. The wages of skilled labour were in the same period from 1s. 6d. to 3s. a day; unskilled, 7\u00bdd. to 1s. 3d. Cart-\nhire, 5s. a day; boat-hire, 4s. a day; camel-hire, 1s. a day for baggage camels, and from 1s. 6d. to 2s. a day for others.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The traffic of the District centres mainly in the town and port of Karachi. The staple exports consist of grain, principally wheat, cotton, and wool.\n\nKarachi District contains three seaports, namely, Karachi, Keti, and Sirganda. The average value of the foreign trade, which is practically confined to Karachi port, for the five years ending 1882-83, was\u2014imports, \u00a3797,645; exports, \u00a31,633,428; total, \u00a32,431,073. In 1882-83, the value of the imports was \u00a31,219,058, and exports, \u00a32,661,754; total, \u00a33,880,812, or \u00a31,449,739 above the average of the five years. The average value of the coastwise trade for all ports for the five years ending 1882-83 was\u2014imports, \u00a32,111,161; exports, \u00a3973,693; total, \u00a33,084,854. In 1882-83, the coastwise trade was returned as follows:\u2014Imports, \u00a32,141,273; exports, \u00a31,159,113; total, \u00a33,300,386, or \u00a3215,532 above the average of the five years. For details of the import and export trade, see the article on Karachi town, where the sea-borne foreign commerce of the District, and practically of the Province of Sind, is centred. The coast-borne trade includes re-imports and re-exports from and to Karachi, which are included in the values of the foreign trade given above.\n\nExtensive salt deposits of the purest description occur in Shah-candar Sub-division, on the Sirganda creek, a branch of the Indus, accessible for small craft of from 50 to 60 tons burthen. According to Captain Burke, of the Bombay Engineers, who surveyed the beds in 1847, they are capable of supplying the whole world with all the salt it needed for a hundred years. Owing to the double excise duty, however, Sirganda salt was long unable to compete with inferior productions sent from other quarters; and the removal of the export duties in 1868 has not improved the trade to the extent anticipated.\n\nThe Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway runs through the entire length of the District, from Karachi to Phulji, via Kotri, a distance of over 230 miles, with 15 stations, the principal ones being Karachi City and Cantonment, Jungshahi (for Tatta), Meting (for Jerruck), Kotri, Laki, and Sehw\u00e1n. It forms the outlet not only for local products, but for a large wheat traffic from the North-West Provinces.\n\nThe sea-fishery of the District is carried on by the Muh\u00e1na tribe of Musalm\u00e1ns, who reside for the most part at Karachi. The principal fish caught on the coast are sharks, rays, and skates. The pearl oyster is found at several places on the coast, and the M\u00edrs conduct pearl operations on their own account. Under British rule, the right has been let for a small sum; but the pearls are very inferior in size and quality, so that the industry has greatly declined of\nlate years. Considerable fisheries also exist in the river Indus, chiefly for the fish known as *pala*; and Government derives a small revenue from this source.\n\nThe local manufactures are confined to Kar\u00e1chi town; Tatta is noted for *lungis*, and Bubak, near Sehw\u00e1n, for carpets. Numerous fairs are held in the District; only 35 are of importance, lasting from one to four days, and attended by from 500 to 16,000 persons.\n\n**Administration.**\u2014The administration of this extensive District is conducted by a Collector-Magistrate, assisted by the several Deputy Collectors, as well as by the *Huzur* Deputy Collector, permanently stationed at head-quarters. The District and Sessions Judge, with his principal court at Kar\u00e1chi, holds periodical sessions at Kotri, Tatta, Batoro, Sehw\u00e1n, and one other town. In 1882\u201383, there were 5 civil judges and 38 stipendary magistrates in the District; maximum distance of a village from nearest court, 60 miles; average distance, 6 miles. The canals of the District form a separate charge, under the superintendence of officials appointed by the Public Works Department. The total police force in the District in 1882 numbered 1376 officers and men, being 1 policeman to every 9\u00b75 square miles and to every 324 of the population. The police were maintained at a cost in 1882 of \u00a325,029. The gross imperial revenue in 1882\u201383 amounted to \u00a3156,327, of which sum \u00a377,503 was contributed by the land-tax. The small amount yielded by the land revenue is due to the large proportion, viz. 90\u00b74 per cent., of barren or desert area within the District. The revenue from excise amounted to \u00a317,131. There are 26 forests in the District, with an aggregate area of 137 square miles. Most of them lie along the banks of the Indus, in the Sh\u00e1hbandar Sub-division. Education has made some advance, but the progress is more striking in Kar\u00e1chi than in the villages of the interior. The total number of State inspected schools in 1882\u201383 amounted to 71, with a roll of 5197 pupils. This is exclusive of unaided or indigenous schools, uninspected by the Education Department; and in 1881 the Census Report returned 6081 boys and 791 girls as under instruction, besides 18,563 males and 1179 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. For fiscal and administrative purposes, the District is sub-divided into the 4 Sub-divisions of Kar\u00e1chi, Sehw\u00e1n, Jerruck, and Shahbandar, each of which see separately.\n\n**Medical Aspects.**\u2014The climate of Kar\u00e1chi city and the neighbouring country, which is in every direction open to the sea-breeze, possesses a great superiority to that which prevails throughout the remainder of Sind. The hill country of Kohist\u00e1n is also cooler in summer and warmer in winter than is the case in the plains. In the north, on the other hand, near the barren Laki range of hills, the heat often becomes insupportable. The hot season commences about the middle or\nend of March, reaches its maximum in the month of July, and lasts till the end of August, when the temperature once more becomes tolerably cool. The rainfall at Kar\u00e1chi is slight and fluctuating, the average hardly exceeding 5 inches per annum. Sometimes one or two years elapse with scarcely a shower. The fall for the four years ending 1874 was 0'12, 7'60, 2'50, and 8'29 inches respectively. In 1874, the maximum reached by the thermometer was 101\u00b0 F., and the minimum 42\u00b0. Kar\u00e1chi city is said to enjoy the healthiest climate in all Sind. Fevers prevail at the setting in of the cold season; and in the hot weather, external inflammations, ulcers, and skin diseases cause much trouble. Cholera appeared in an epidemic form in 1865, 1867, and 1869, in the last of which years terrible mortality occurred in the town of Kotri. In 1882-83, 9871 births were registered and 8807 deaths, giving a death-rate of 18'4 per 1000. Fever caused by far the largest portion of the deaths. The mean ratio of deaths during the five years ending 1882 was 16 per thousand. In the same year 22,258 persons were vaccinated. [For further information regarding Kar\u00e1chi District, see the Gazetteer of the Province of Sind, by Mr. A. W. Hughes (London, George Bell & Co., 1876, second edition).

Area, 1291 square miles; containing 1 town and 3 villages, with 12,654 houses. Population (1881) 88,588, namely, 52,270 males and 36,318 females. Hindus numbered 25,690; Muhammadans, 52,845; Sikhs, 2640; aboriginal tribes, 2194; Christians, 4165; Jews, 93; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 937; Jains, 9; Brahmos, 12; and Buddhists, 3.\n\nBounded north by Kohist\u00e1n and the Hab river; on the west by the Hab and the Arabian Sea; on the south by the Arabian Sea; and on the east by Jerruck. Hilly towards the north and west, where several lofty and barren ranges occur. A small chain of hills runs for some miles parallel to the Hab river, terminating in the headland of Ras Mu\u00e1r or Cape Monze, a landmark for sailors making the port of Kar\u00e1chi. The hills afford good pasturage after the rains for cattle sent from the lowlands. The t\u00e1luk contains no canals, but is drained by several mountain torrents, the chief of which are the Malir and Lay\u00e1ri. Salt marshes occur along the sea-coast, and abound with mangroves and other marsh trees. The hot springs of Pir Mangho are within the t\u00e1luk, 7 miles north of Kar\u00e1chi city. There are no forests. Crocodiles, leopards, and wild sheep are found. Sharks and sardines (Clupea\nneohowii) frequent the coast. Revenue in 1882-83, exclusive of the revenue of Kar\u00e1chi city, \u00a34775. The only municipality is that of Kar\u00e1chi. Much of the fertile portion of the taluk is devoted to raising vegetables and fruit for the Kar\u00e1chi market. Custard-apples, guavas, mangoes, oranges, grapes, and melons are produced. Up to 1876 no regular settlement had been effected. According to the system then in force, there were two rates of land-tax\u2014those on garden and dry crop lands, the former being about 2s. and the latter 1s. The taluk contains 2 civil and 6 criminal courts; police-stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), 5; regular police, 579 men.\n\nKar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee).\u2014Seaport, chief town, cantonment, and municipality in Kar\u00e1chi District, Sind Province, Bombay Presidency. Kar\u00e1chi is situated in lat. 24\u00b0 51' 9\" N., and long. 67\u00b0 4' 15\" E., at the extreme northern end of the Indus Delta, near the southern base of the Pab Mountains of Baluchist\u00e1n. Population (1881) 73,560 (town, 68,332; cantonment, 5228).\n\nPosition, etc.\u2014The bay of Kar\u00e1chi is formed by the projecting headland of Manora Point, the extremity of a reef 10 miles in length, which supplies a natural barrier against the waters of the Arabian Sea. The opening of the bay between Manora and the opposite sanitarium of Clifton has a width of about 3\u00bd miles; but the mouth is blocked by a group of rocky islets, known as the 'Oyster Rocks,' as well as by the larger island of Kiam\u00e1ri, a little in the rear. The harbour stretches for 5 miles northward from Manora Head to the narrows of the Lay\u00e1ri river, and about the same distance from the old town of Kar\u00e1chi on the eastern shore to the extreme western point. Only a small portion of this extensive area, however, is capable of accommodating large vessels. Manora Head, the first object visible to a voyager approaching Kar\u00e1chi from the sea, is crowned by a lighthouse, having a fixed light 120 feet above sea-level, and visible for 17 miles around in clear weather. The point also affords room for a fort, said to have been first erected in 1797, the port and pilot establishment, the buildings in connection with the harbour improvements, and a portion of the Indo-European telegraph department. Besides a library, billiard-room, and European school, Manora possesses an English church, intended for the crews of vessels frequenting the harbour.\n\nOn the opposite side of the mouth, the island of Kiam\u00e1ri forms the landing-place for all passengers and goods bound for Kar\u00e1chi, and has three piers. A road running along the Napier Mole, 3 miles long, connects the island with the town and mainland. The Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway also extends to Kiam\u00e1ri; but instead of following the mole it takes a more circuitous route to the south by the edge of a large lagoon, the waters of which are passed through the mole by a fine screw-pile bridge, 1200 feet in length, erected\nin 1865 at a cost of \u00a347,500, so as to allow them to flow uninterruptedly into the harbour as a means of scouring the channel. At the northern extremity of this bridge, and running in a westerly direction, stands the native jetty, built of stone at an expense of \u00a343,300. At the end of the mole, on the mainland side, the custom-house runs right across the road, which pierces it by five arches, thus intercepting all traffic.\n\nTwo principal thoroughfares lead from the custom-house to the Kar\u00e1chi cantonments, known respectively as the Bandar and the M'Leod roads. The oldest portion of the town is situated along the former route, close to the harbour, containing the most thickly populated quarter in Kar\u00e1chi. The municipality has lately widened and paved the streets, and effected other improvements which must conduce to the health of the inhabitants, who are chiefly Hindu and Muhammadan merchants. The Lay\u00e1ri, a river only in name, as it contains water only some three or four times a year, separates this quarter from the Lay\u00e1ri suburb. On the M'Leod Road are situated the court-house, the new Bank of Bombay, the Agra Bank, the Chamber of Commerce, Messrs. Mackenzie & Cosser's ironworks, and three important cotton-press houses\u2014the M'Leod Road presses, owned by the Sind Press Company, capable of turning out daily 350 pressed bales of cotton; the Tyabji presses, erected in 1865 at a cost of \u00a322,000, and turning out 250 bales; and the Albert presses, leased to the Sind Press Company, and turning out 390 bales. This quarter also contains the charitable dispensary, the railway station, several schools, a new Hindu temple, and most of the offices belonging to European merchants. The Afgh\u00e1n sar\u00e1i, intended for the use of K\u00e1f\u00edlas, or caravans from Kandah\u00e1r, rebuilt by the municipality in 1873 at a cost of \u00a31954, covers an area of about 3 acres. Nearer to the cantonments, a number of bungalows stand on the intervening space; while the civil lines skirt the cantonment itself to the eastward.\n\nThe military quarter, which is situated to the north and east of the town proper, consists of three portions\u2014the d\u00e9p\u00f4t lines, the artillery lines, and the European infantry lines. The d\u00e9p\u00f4t lines are the oldest military portion of Kar\u00e1chi, and supply accommodation to troops passing up-country from the sea or vice versa. The d\u00e9p\u00f4t was abolished in 1871, and all invalid soldiers from the Punjab are now sent by rail to Bombay via Jabalpur. The artillery lines have three fine upper-storied barracks, a hospital, gunsheds, workshops, racket-courts, bowling-alleys, and a plunge-bath. The European infantry lines can house an entire regiment. The Government garden, distant about half a mile from cantonments, covers an area of 40 acres, neatly laid out with trees and shrubs.\n\nChief Buildings.\u2014The architecture of Kar\u00e1chi is essentially modern and Anglo-Indian. The principal church is the Anglican one of the\nHoly Trinity, situated in the cantonments. It stands in a large open space, 15 acres in extent, and consists of a heavy, ungainly Italian nave, with a disproportionately tall and ugly tower. The old Roman Catholic Chapel of St. Patrick, also situated in the cantonments, cannot be said to represent any particular style of architecture, and has now been converted into a school for boys, since the construction of a new building called St. Patrick's Church. St. Patrick's school is a fine stone building, capable of accommodating 40 boarders and 200 day-scholars. The European and Indo-European school, founded in 1854, under the auspices of the late Sir Bartle Frere, then Commissioner of Sind, occupies a handsome stone structure in the d\u00e9p\u00f4t lines. The other chief modern institutions include the Presbyterian Church of St. Andrew, Christ's Church and mission schools, the Napi\u00e8r Barracks, Gisri Military Sanitarium, and post-office. The Frere Hall, a municipal building named in honour of the late Commissioner, stands on a slight elevation near Trinity Church. It was opened in a somewhat unfinished state in October 1865, up to which date \u00a317,391 had been expended upon its erection. This hall, which is a comparatively good specimen of slightly adapted Venetian Gothic, contains the Kar\u00e1chi General Library and Museum. Government House, the residence of the Commissioner of Sind, is situated in the civil quarter, and consists of a central building with two wings, approached by five separate carriage drives. Though commodious and comfortable in its interior arrangements, the exterior can lay no claim to architectural beauty. It was originally built by Sir Charles Napier when Governor of the Province. It was purchased by Government for \u00a35000 in 1847, and an upper storey was added by General Jacob when acting-Commissioner in 1856.\n\nHistory.\u2014Kar\u00e1chi came into British possession in 1842. The town may be regarded as almost a creation of British rule, its extensive commerce, splendid harbour works, and numerous flourishing institutions having all sprung up since the introduction of our settled administration. Before 1725, no town whatever appears to have existed on the site; but a town named Kharak, with a considerable commerce, is mentioned as lying on the other side of the Hab river at the confluence of the river and the sea. The entrance to Kharak harbour, however, becoming blocked with sand, a migration was made to a spot near the present head of Kar\u00e1chi harbour, and at that time (1729) called Kal\u00e1chi Kun; and in time, under J\u00e1m Daria Kh\u00e1n Jokia, some little trade began to centre upon the convenient harbour. Cannon brought from Muscat fortified the little fort, and the name of Kar\u00e1chi, supposed to be a corrupt form of Kal\u00e1chi, was bestowed upon the rising village. The hopeless blocking up of Sh\u00e1hbandar harbour shortly afterwards drove much of its former trade and population to Kar\u00e1chi.\n\nUnder the Kalhora princes, the Kh\u00e1n of Khel\u00e1t obtained a grant of the\ntown, which he garrisoned from his own territory. Within the short period 1792-1795, three Bal\u00fach armies appeared before the town; but only on the third occasion did the Talpur chief of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, who led the Bal\u00fach troops, gain possession by force of arms. A fort was built at Manora, at the mouth of the harbour. The Talpur chiefs made considerable efforts to increase the trade of Kar\u00e1chi, so that in 1838 the town and suburbs had a population of 14,000, half of whom were Hindus. The houses were all flat-roofed, and built of mud, very few of them having more than one storey: each house had its badgir or wind-catcher for the purposes of ventilation. The Government under the M\u00edrs was vested in a civil and military official, the Naw\u00e1b, who ruled despotically over the town and neighbourhood.\n\n**Population.**\u2014The Census of 1881 returned the total number of inhabitants, including the cantonment, at 73,560, namely, 43,561 males and 29,999 females. The military force, with camp followers, amounted to 5228 men, comprising a battery of Royal Artillery, 1 European and 1 Native infantry regiment, and the men and families of the ordnance and barrack departments. The Muhammadans numbered 38,946, and the Hindus 24,617; Christians, 4161; Pars\u00eds, 937; Jains, 9; and \u2018others,\u2019 4890. The proportion of European inhabitants in Kar\u00e1chi is unusually large.\n\n**Commerce and Trade, etc.**\u2014Even before the period of British rule, the commerce of Kar\u00e1chi had attained to some importance, owing to the value of the river Indus as a channel of communication. Nevertheless, the sparse population of the country, combined with the short-sighted and selfish policy of its rulers, prevented it from reaching its proper development. Under the Talpur M\u00edrs, all imports were subjected to a 4 per cent. duty, and all exports to one of 2\u00bd per cent. In 1809, the customs revenue amounted to \u00a39900; by 1838, it had risen to \u00a315,000. In the latter year, the whole trade of the town was valued at \u00a3374,700. The following list gives the value of the principal articles of trade in 1837, under the M\u00edrs, six years before British annexation:\u2014Imports\u2014English silk, broadcloth, chintz, etc., \u00a360,000; Bengal and China raw silk, \u00a324,800; slaves, \u00a312,000; dates, \u00a310,000; sugar, \u00a38500; ivory, \u00a36400; copper, \u00a35400; spices, \u00a35850; and cotton, \u00a33750: Exports\u2014opium, \u00a3160,000; gh\u00ed, \u00a317,000; indigo, \u00a312,000; wheat, \u00a36750; madder, \u00a34500; wool, \u00a33500; raisins, \u00a33200; and salt fish, \u00a33000. Slaves came chiefly from Muscat, and consisted of negroes or Abyssinians. Opium to the extent of 500 camel-loads came from M\u00e1rv\u00e1r, and was exported to the Portuguese town of Dam\u00e1n. Almost all the goods imported into Sind were then consumed within the Province, only \u00a315,000 worth being sent across the frontier. The total gross revenue drawn from the town and port of Kar\u00e1chi by the M\u00edrs in 1837 amounted to \u00a317,389.\nIn 1843-44, the first year of British rule, the trade of Kar\u00e1chi, including Keti and Sirganda, had a total value of \u00a3122,160, comprising exports, \u00a31010, and imports, \u00a3121,150. The second year of British rule saw a rise to \u00a3227,000, the third to \u00a3353,400, and the fifth to \u00a3442,602. By 1852-53, the total value had risen to \u00a3812,000, comprising imports, \u00a3535,690, and exports, \u00a3276,310. Apart from the increase in the trade as a whole, the rapid development of the exports deserves attention. In 1855-56, the figures stood as follows:\u2014Imports, \u00a3629,813; exports, \u00a3604,440; total, \u00a31,234,253. In 1857-58, the exports nearly overtook the imports, the two standing respectively at \u00a31,081,101 and \u00a31,078,128; total, \u00a32,159,229. The American civil war gave an enormous impetus to the trade of Kar\u00e1chi, by the high demand for Indian cotton which it created in the European markets; and in 1862-63, the total value of the trade amounted to no less than \u00a35,316,424, viz. imports, \u00a32,188,943, and exports, \u00a33,127,481, being the first year in which the balance stood in favour of Kar\u00e1chi. In 1863-64, the total returns rose to \u00a36,567,685, viz. imports, \u00a32,520,898, and exports, \u00a34,046,787. The restoration of peace in America, however, brought about a lower price for cotton in the home markets, and the trade of Kar\u00e1chi gradually returned to what was then considered its normal level. The total value sank from \u00a35,058,802 in 1864-65, to \u00a34,053,610 in 1867-68, and \u00a33,507,684 in 1873-74.\n\nIn 1882-83, the trade of Kar\u00e1chi port, both foreign and coastwise, had increased in value to \u00a37,077,084, namely, imports, \u00a33,329,148, and exports, \u00a33,747,936. Including the two minor ports of Keti and Sirganda, the total sea-borne trade of Kar\u00e1chi District (foreign and coastwise) was \u00a37,181,109, or double that of nine years previously. The main cause of the increase is due to the annually augmenting exports of wheat and other food-grains, and oil-seeds. The following were the articles of foreign import, with their values, for the three ports, in 1882-83:\u2014Apparel, \u00a318,879; cotton piece-goods, \u00a3201,683; other cotton manufactures, \u00a34467; cotton twist and yarn, and raw cotton, \u00a333,360; raw wool, \u00a330,180; manufactures of wool, \u00a35505; coal and coke, \u00a323,997; patent fuel, \u00a312,964; hardware and cutlery, \u00a323,530; malt liquors, \u00a315,096; wines and liqueurs, \u00a334,448; spirits, \u00a368,665; metals, wrought and unwrought (chiefly copper, iron, and steel), \u00a3195,438; matches, \u00a36466; provisions, \u00a3116,697; railway plant and rolling stock, \u00a3194,247; spices, \u00a3108; sugar, molasses, etc., \u00a3272; manufactured tobacco, \u00a32744; hops, \u00a319,405; machinery and mill-work, \u00a315,016; paints, colours, painters' materials, printing and writing paper, \u00a311,631; glass\u2014sheet, plate, bottles, bead, etc., \u00a38808; grain, \u00a36974 (wheat, \u00a35218, and pulse, \u00a31756); leather, unwrought and manufactured, \u00a36539; drugs and medicines, \u00a35612;\nmilitary and other uniforms and accoutrements, \u00a35373; arms and ammunition, \u00a35312; other merchandise, \u00a311,344; and specie, \u00a332,202: total imports from foreign ports, including treasure, \u00a31,219,058. The following list shows some of the countries from which these imports were received:\u2014United Kingdom, \u00a3571,574; Persia, \u00a343,545; France, \u00a33162; Italy, \u00a33460; United States, \u00a323,764; Austria, \u00a3728; Arabia, \u00a313,730. The imports coastwise into Kar\u00e1chi and the two subordinate ports in 1882-83, amounted to \u00a31,939,122 of private merchandise and \u00a3202,151 of specie, giving a total of \u00a32,141,273, of which \u00a32,010,100 represented the imports of Kar\u00e1chi port alone. The imports, foreign and coastwise, into the three ports amounted to \u00a33,360,332.\n\nFrom the United Kingdom, Kar\u00e1chi imports cotton manufactures, railway materials, liquors, coal and coke, machinery, metals, provisions, apparel, drugs, and medicines; from Bombay, cotton piece-goods and twist, treasure, metals, silk, sugar, tea, jute, spices, dyes, woollen manufactures, cocoa-nuts, manufactured silk, liquors, fruit, and vegetables; from the Persian Gulf, dried fruits, treasure, wool, grain, and horses; from the coast of Makr\u00e1n, wool, provisions, grain, and pulses; from Calcutta, jute, sugar, grain, and pulses; from the United States, oil for lighting and other purposes; and from Persia, dyeing materials.\n\nThe following list shows the value of the exports to foreign ports from the three ports in 1882-83:\u2014Apparel, \u00a32192; raw cotton, twist and yarn, \u00a3241,686; cotton goods, \u00a319,837; dyes (mostly indigo), \u00a349,245; fruits and vegetables, \u00a3385; grain and pulses, \u00a31,376,739, of which \u00a31,281,268 represented wheat; hides and skins, \u00a340,815; oil, \u00a35413; provisions, \u00a36913; oil-seeds, chiefly rape and til (Sesamum indicum), \u00a3583,495; wood, \u00a3988; raw wool, \u00a3239,945; shawls and other woollen manufactures, \u00a31290; sugar, \u00a3572; specie, \u00a342,070; and other articles, \u00a350,169. Total value of exports, including treasure, \u00a32,661,754. The following list shows the distribution among the several countries:\u2014United Kingdom, \u00a3825,914; Bombay, \u00a3913,625; France, \u00a3588,690; Mauritius, \u00a37356; Madras, \u00a31897; Persia, \u00a3110,227; Arabia, \u00a39344; Cutch, \u00a3107,762; Austria, \u00a323,765; Bengal, \u00a36936; Italy, \u00a319,843; China, \u00a3109,293; and to other countries, \u00a3986,549, or about a million sterling. The exports coastwise from Kar\u00e1chi and the two ports of Keti and Sirganda amounted to \u00a31,159,113 in 1882-83, of which \u00a31,086,200 represented the exports of Kar\u00e1chi alone. The exports, foreign and coastwise, from the three ports amounted to \u00a33,820,867.\n\nTo the United Kingdom, Kar\u00e1chi exports cotton, wool, indigo, seeds, hides, skins, tea, and oils; to France, wheat, cotton, gingelli, and rape-seed; to Bombay, Cutch, and Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t), cotton, grain, ghi,\nindigo, oils, seeds, rice, raw silk, shawls, wool, and horses; to Mauritius, grain, pulses, and oils; to Persia, indigo, oils, hides, skins, and piece-goods; to Madras, horses; and to China, raw cotton.\n\nThe inland trade of Kar\u00e1chi includes, besides goods from the Upper Provinces by rail, a large quantity of wool, dried fruits, and horses from Kandah\u00e1r and Khel\u00e1t; while camels, bullocks, and donkeys bring in firewood, grass, ghi, date-leaves, hides, etc., from Las Bel\u00e1 and Kohist\u00e1n.\n\nThe total coasting trade of the three ports, import and export, was in 1882-83, \u00a33,300,386, of which \u00a33,096,300 represented Kar\u00e1chi port alone. It must be remembered that these figures include re-imports and re-exports which have already been given in the figures for foreign trade. The total sea-customs revenue of Kar\u00e1chi port in 1882-83 amounted to \u00a341,117\u2014viz. import duty, \u00a335,025; export duty, \u00a36151. The customs duties were abolished throughout India in 1882, with the exception of the import duties on salt, wines and spirits, opium, arms and ammunition. Kar\u00e1chi is therefore now practically a free port.\n\nShipping, etc.\u2014The harbour of Kar\u00e1chi, during the period of the Talpur M\u00edrs, and for the first few years after British annexation, was only capable of accommodating small native craft. Steamers and large ships anchored outside Manora Point, whence men and stores were conveyed in boats up the river, as far as the tide permitted, and then transferred into canoes, which carried them through a sea of liquid mud to a spot near the site of the existing custom-house. In process of time, however, it became apparent that the bar did not interpose so great an obstacle as was originally supposed, and that square-rigged vessels of a certain draught could cross it with safety. Up to 1851, only one English sailing ship had entered the harbour. In 1852, however, the Duke of Argyle, a vessel of 800 tons, arrived at Kar\u00e1chi from England direct with troops, coal, and iron. In 1854, under the Chief Commissionership of the late Sir Bartle Frere, the Napier Mole road or causeway, connecting Kar\u00e1chi with the island of Kiam\u00e1ri, was completed, and thus offered additional inducements to ships for visiting the harbour.\n\nIn 1856, a scheme for improving the harbour by deepening the water on the bar was submitted for the opinion of Mr. James Walker, an eminent London engineer, who estimated the cost of works to provide an ample width of passage with a depth of 25 feet at neap tides, at \u00a3287,000. After much debate and intermissions, owing to partial failures, the principal part of the works\u2014the Manora breakwater, 1503 feet in length\u2014was commenced in March 1869, and completed in February 1873. It affords complete shelter to the western channel over the bar during the south-west monsoon, and combined with other works, has already led to the deepening\nat the entrance to 20 feet at low-water spring tides. The rise and fall is about 8 feet. The other portions of these extensive works include the Kiam\u00e1ri groyne or stone bank, the east pier, the screw-pile bridge on the Napier Mole, the native jetty, and the Chini creek stoppage. The total expenditure on the harbour improvements, up to December 1873, amounted to \u00a3449,798.\n\nIn 1847-48, the number of vessels which entered the harbour was 891, all native craft, with a total burden of 30,509 tons. In 1873-74, the list included 30 square-rigged sailing vessels, 152 steamers, and 731 native craft, making a total of 913 ships, with a tonnage of 161,284 tons, or more than five times that of 1847. In 1882-83, 373 vessels (of which 95 were steam vessels) entered Kar\u00e1chi harbour with cargoes from foreign ports: gross tonnage, 105,251 tons. In the same year 398 vessels (of which 148 were propelled by steam) cleared with cargoes from Kar\u00e1chi for foreign ports: gross tonnage, 175,896 tons. From the ports on the coasts of India and Burma 1551 vessels entered Kar\u00e1chi laden with cargoes; tonnage 198,673; of these 1382 were native craft. For the ports on the coasts of India and Burma 1252 vessels cleared from Kar\u00e1chi laden with cargoes, tonnage 178,100; of these 1100 were native craft.\n\nMunicipality, etc.\u2014The Kar\u00e1chi municipality was established in September 1852. Its revenue in 1874 amounted to \u00a322,596, and its expenditure to \u00a320,142. In 1882-83, the municipal income was \u00a330,126, and the expenditure \u00a340,732; incidence of municipal taxation, 5s. 2d. per head. The municipal police force in 1881 numbered 56 men. The jail, completed in 1868, is capable of accommodating nearly 800 prisoners. Education is carried on by the Government high school, Anglo-veracular schools, 13 Government vernacular schools, and several female and other minor establishments. Ten schools, with 942 pupils, were within municipal limits in 1882-83, supported by local funds. Six newspapers or periodicals are published at Kar\u00e1chi, three English (including the Government Sind Official Gazette, with a vernacular translation; and the Sind Gazette) and three native (in Sind\u00ed, Gujar\u00e1thi, and Persian respectively). The five charitable dispensaries afforded relief in 1883 to 48,505 persons, of whom 1010 were in-door patients treated in Kar\u00e1chi Civil Hospital. A sick hospital was established in 1869, in connection with the cantonments.\n\nMedical Aspects, Water-Supply, etc.\u2014The climate of Kar\u00e1chi, owing to the prevalence of sea-breezes during eight months of the year, has a better reputation for healthiness than any other in Sind. The low situation of the city, and the near neighbourhood of marsh land, render the atmosphere both moist and warm; but the heat during the hottest months cannot compare with that experienced in the interior. The mean annual temperature, calculated from data extending over\nnineteen years, may be stated at $77^\\circ$ F. The hottest weather occurs in April, May, and June, though September and October are also often close and sultry.\n\nThe difficulty of water-supply long formed one of the chief drawbacks to Kar\u00e1chi, most of the wells being too brackish for drinking purposes. Formerly, the supply was mainly derived from wells tapping a subterranean bed of the Lay\u00e1ri. The inhabitants of Kiam\u00e1ri, and the shipping in the harbour, obtained water from carts, which brought it up from camp. For the purposes of ice manufacture, water was formerly imported by rail from Kotri. A scheme for constructing an underground aqueduct, 18 miles in length, from the Malir river, at a cost of \u00a348,000, has been recently carried out, and the town is now in possession of a pure water-supply. The foundation stone was laid in February 1880, by Sir Richard Temple, Governor of Bombay. The works were finally opened in 1882. The estimated cost of this undertaking, including pipes for distributing the water to the town, Kiam\u00e1ri, and the cantonments, amounted to 14 l\u00f3khs of rupees (say \u00a3140,000).\n\nThe prevalent diseases of Kar\u00e1chi include intermittent fevers, chronic rheumatism, and bowel complaints, arising apparently from imperfect drainage, variable climate, and unwholesome drinking water. Cholera occurred in an epidemic form in 1865, 1867, and 1869, and small-pox in 1866, 1868, and 1870.\n\nKar\u00e1d.\u2014Sub-division of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 395 square miles; contains 2 towns and 102 villages. Population (1872) 133,122; (1881) 140,920, namely, 70,721 males and 70,199 females, dwelling in 16,971 houses. Hindus numbered 135,075; Muhammadans, 5315; and \u2018others,\u2019 530. Land revenue, \u00a31091. The Sub-division contains 1 civil and 3 criminal courts; police station (th\u00e1n\u00e1), 1; regular police, 65 men; village watchmen, 112.\n\nKar\u00e1d.\u2014Chief town of the Kar\u00e1d Sub-division, S\u00e1t\u00e1ra District, Bombay Presidency; situated at the confluence of the Koyna tributary with the Kistna river, and on the Bombay-Madras high road, 31 miles south-south-east of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra town, about four miles south-west of Kar\u00e1d road station on the West Deccan line of the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Railway. Lat. $17^\\circ 17'$ N., and long. $74^\\circ 13' 30''$ E. Population (1872) 11,410; (1881) 10,778, namely, 5459 males and 5319 females. Hindus numbered 9197; Muhammadans, 1495; Jains, 84; and Christians, 2. Area of town site, 235 acres. Municipal income (1882\u201383), \u00a31045; incidence of taxation per head of population, 1s.; municipal expenditure, \u00a3430. Sub-judge\u2019s court, post-office, and dispensary.\n\nK\u00e1r\u00e1gol\u00e1.\u2014Village in Purniah District, Bengal; situated on the left bank of the Ganges, in lat. $25^\\circ 23' 30''$ N., long. $87^\\circ 30' 51''$ E. K\u00e1r\u00e1gol\u00e1 is on the old route from Calcutta to D\u00e1rjiling, and is the terminus to which a steamer runs from S\u00e1hibganj in connection with\nthe East Indian Railway. Of late years, however, a large sandbank has formed in front of the village, on account of which the steamer, except during the rainy season, is obliged to anchor at a point 2 miles farther down the river. K\u00e1r\u00e1gol\u00e1 contains a police-outpost station, d\u00e1k bungalow or staging inn, and a post-office, which, until the opening of the Northern Bengal State Railway, was also the chief agency for the Government post-carriage service to D\u00e1rjiling. A native firm of carriage-owners is also established here.\n\nThe village of K\u00e1r\u00e1gol\u00e1 derives its chief importance from being the site of one of the largest fairs in the Lower Provinces of Bengal. It was formerly held at Pirpainti in Bh\u00e1galpur District, on the opposite bank of the Ganges; but early in the century it was removed to Purniah, and, after various shifting, was held at K\u00e1r\u00e1gol\u00e1 in 1851, and has been regularly held there since, except in 1874, the year of the Behar scarcity. The fair is held on a large sandy plain, on ground belonging to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Darbhanga. During the continuance of the fair, which lasts for ten days, the plain is covered with streets of small shops constructed of bamboos and matting, in which nearly every article required for domestic use is to be found. There is a large sale for cloth of all kinds, from thick English woollens, long-cloth of European and native make, down to fine Dacca muslins. A considerable trade is also carried on in iron ploughshares of Monghyr make and plain English cutlery. Brass and bell-metal cooking utensils are brought in great numbers from Calcutta and R\u00e1jsh\u00e1h\u00ed. The south of Purniah supplies blankets and rugs from S\u00e1ifganj and Kad\u00e1b\u00e1, and reed-mats from Balr\u00e1mpur. Ornamental cabinet-ware, as well as common furniture, also stone handmills for grinding corn, etc., come from Monghyr. Calcutta and some of the large up-country towns send dressed leather, boots, looking-glasses, and R\u00e1mpur shawls. Spices from Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d and Nadiy\u00e1, and lac ornaments and toys from Monghyr and B\u00edrbh\u00fam, are largely sold. A few dealers in trinkets and pedlars\u2019 ware also attend. Since the prohibition of the sale of firearms and ammunition, the attendance of Nep\u00e1l\u00eds has somewhat diminished. They still visit the fair, however, bringing knives, kukr\u00eds, hill canes, j\u00e1k tails, drugs, a little coarse lac, and hill ponies. Food-grain is only sold in such quantities as to meet the immediate requirements of the visitors. The business done is generally purely retail; but in some years, when country produce is in much request, and large stocks are on hand, a wholesale trade is developed during the last two or three days of the fair. In 1876, it was estimated that 40,000 persons attended. In 1881, the estimated attendance at the fair was 30,000. Epidemics frequently break out at the gathering; and since 1870, cholera has twice spread from K\u00e1r\u00e1gol\u00e1 over the District, with fatal results.\nKar\u00e1i.\u2014River of Northern Behar, or rather the local name of part of the B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed river system in Darbhanga District. The Great B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed bifurcates about a mile above Haia gh\u00e1t, where its north-eastern channel picks up the Little B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed, and under the name of the Kar\u00e1i flows south-eastwards and joins the K\u00e1mla at Tilkeswar gh\u00e1t on the northern boundary of Monghyr District, in lat. 25\u00b0 44' N., and long. 86\u00b0 28' E. It is navigable during the rainy months by boats of about 75 tons burden. This part of Darbhanga District is a close network of watercourses connected with the two B\u00e1ghmat\u00eds, the K\u00e1mla, the Bolan, and the Tiljuga, under various names. There is not, and never was, any independent river called the Kar\u00e1i.\n\nKar\u00e1ib\u00e1ri.\u2014Forest tract within the G\u00e1ro Hills, Assam, extending from the Kalankini river on the west, to the Bogai river in the south of the District, belonging to the wealthy zamind\u00e1rs of Kar\u00e1ib\u00e1ri, whose zamind\u00e1ri estates lie chiefly within Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District. The forest tract has now been clearly demarcated by a survey party, and is managed by Government, which collects the revenue derived therefrom through its own forest officers, and hands over 75 per cent. of the proceeds to the zamind\u00e1rs, retaining 25 per cent. for costs of collection. The weekly market held in the vicinity at Bah\u00e1dur K\u00e1ta h\u00e1t, at the foot of the hills, is largely frequented by G\u00e1ros, who bring down the produce of their hills to exchange for cotton goods, salt, and hardware.\n\nK\u00e1raich\u00fat\u00fa.\u2014Town in Tenkarai t\u00e1luk or Sub-division of Tinnevell\u00ed District, Madras Presidency; situated in lat. 8\u00b0 24' 45\" N., and long. 78\u00b0 7' 20\" E. Area, 3210 acres. Population (1881) 5476. Considerable trade in palm-sugar (jaggery) and rice.\n\nK\u00e1raimadai (Karamady).\u2014Town in Coimbatore Sub-division of Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 11\u00b0 10' 45\" N., long. 76\u00b0 59' E. Population (1872) 2677; (1881) 9418; number of houses, 518. Hindus numbered 9000; Muhammadans, 396; Christians, 19; and 'others,' 3. Station, 17 miles from Coimbatore, on the Nilgiri branch of the Madras Railway. There is a Vishnuite pagoda here which is held in great local esteem.\n\nK\u00e1rajga\u00f3n.\u2014Town in Ellichpur District, Ber\u00e1r, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Deccan. Lat. 21\u00b0 19' 30\" N., long. 77\u00b0 39' E.; about 8 miles north-east of Ellichpur, formerly the head-quarters of a t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r's grant. Population (1867) 7369; (1881) 7330, namely, 3771 males and 3559 females. Of the total population, 6529 were Hindus, 716 Muhammadans, and 85 Jains. Garden cultivation very extensive. Weekly market on Mondays; wheat, rice, gram, and mahu\u00e1 are brought in from the hills; good bullocks are also procurable. Government school. A former t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r, Vithal Bh\u00e1gdeo, in 1806, built a fortified residence of fine sandstone, which is now in a ruinous condition.\n\nKarajgi.\u2014Sub-division of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, Bombay Presidency.\nArea, 442 square miles, containing 1 town and 129 villages. Population (1872) 71,215; (1881) 83,216, namely, 41,888 males and 41,328 females, dwelling in 14,691 houses. Hindus numbered 74,689; Muhammadans, 8096; and 'others,' 431. Except in the south-west, where it is broken by hills, the country is flat. It is crossed from east to west by the Varada, a tributary of the Tungabhadra river. In the north and east the soil is black, and in the south and west mostly red, with an occasional plot of black. In 1881-82, out of 129,001 acres, the whole area occupied for tillage, 25,550 acres, or 19.8 per cent., were fallow or under grass. Of the 103,451 acres actually under tillage, grain crops occupied 51,210 acres; pulses, 12,410 acres; oil-seeds, 5415 acres; fibres, 30,815 acres; miscellaneous crops, 3601 acres. The Sub-division contains 1 civil and 3 criminal courts, and has 1 police station (thana), 37 regular police, and 204 village watchmen (chaukiddars). Land revenue, \u00a319,232.\n\nKarajgi.\u2014Head-quarters of Karajgi Sub-division, Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 14\u00b0 52' N., long. 75\u00b0 31' E. Situated about 50 miles south-east of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and about seven miles north-east of H\u00e1veri station on the Harih\u00e1r branch of the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Railway. Population (1881) 3838. Weekly market on Tuesdays, when millet and pulse are sold. Post-office.\n\nK\u00e1r\u00e1kal ('Black-stone').\u2014Town in Ud\u00edpi t\u00e1luk or Sub-division of South K\u00e1nara District, Madras Presidency. Situated in lat. 13\u00b0 12' 40\" N., and long. 75\u00b0 1' 50\" E.; on one of the main lines leading from Mysore to Mangalore (via Ag\u00fambay gh\u00e1t). Population (1871) 3269; (1881) 3392. Hindus numbered 2717; Muhammadans, 379; Christians, 240; and 'others,' 56. Number of houses, 611. The centre of a considerable rice trade. K\u00e1r\u00e1kal was formerly a Jain town of some size and importance; and the antiquarian remains are very interesting. Chief among them is a colossal monolithic figure of Buddha or Gautama, locally known as Gumpta, after Gumta R\u00e1ya, once ruler of the country. The figure is placed on a huge black rock, and is within a fraction of 50 feet high. On the same rock or hill is a Jain pagoda or Basti, containing some images of the later Buddhist type. A high monolithic Dvaja Stamba (a kind of obelisk), the ruins of the Wadiy\u00e1's palace, a Hindu temple containing a figure of Anantashin, and a Jain impaling stone, are the other curiosities of the village.\n\nKarakor\u00e1m Pass.\u2014The name applied to the point where the principal route between India and Eastern T\u00fark\u00edst\u00e1n traverses the water-parting between the river basins of those two regions. Strictly, in the sense in which pass is used as equivalent to col, or as denoting a marked depression in an otherwise inaccessible ridge, the Karakoram Pass is a misnomer. Dr. T. Thomson, of the Bengal Army, the first European who is known to have set foot on it, and who reached it on\nthe 19th August 1848, describes it as 'a rounded ridge connecting two hills, which rise somewhat abruptly to the height of perhaps 1000 feet above the summit of the pass.' Dr. Scully speaks of it in very similar language: 'Northwards (of the Depsang plain) we saw a few irregular, flat-topped hillocks. . . . We ascended a few hundred yards to a small commissure of loose detritus connecting two low hills, and found ourselves on the Karakoram Pass. The descent on the north side was even less than the ascent had been, and altogether the Karakoram Pass reminded one of a short embankment 300 feet or so above the level of the surrounding country.' Dr. Thomson remarks, that on the crest of the pass the rock was limestone, showing obscure traces of fossils; the shingle composed of a brittle black slate lay scattered over the ridge. Vegetation is entirely wanting.\n\nThe name Karakoram has been extended by some geographers to a fancied range occupying the exact line of water-parting between those streams which discharge into the Tarim basin and those which join the Indus, while others have applied the name to the closely contiguous range usually called Muztagh. The late Mr. R. B. Shaw, the well-known geographer, has, however, conclusively shown the fallacy of the former view; while as regards the second contention, the appropriateness of the name Muztagh (ice-mountain), and the fact that the Karakoram Pass lies some distance northward of this undoubted range, have since induced most geographers to restrict the name Karakoram to the above pass. The enormous physical difficulties of the Karakoram route, combined with the scarcity of supplies along it (apart from political considerations), must always prove an almost insuperable bar to any extensive exchange of intercourse between India and Eastern Turkestan in this direction. Its height above mean sea-level is 18,550 feet. Lat. 35\u00b0 33' N.\n\nKaramnasa (Karman\u00e1s\u00e1, 'the Destroyer of Religious Merit').\u2014The accursed stream of Hindu mythology; rising on the eastern ridge of the Kaimur Hills, Shahabad District, Bengal, in lat. 24\u00b0 34' 30\" N., long. 83\u00b0 41' 30\" E. It flows in a north-westerly direction, and near Darihara it forms the boundary line between Bengal and the North-Western Provinces, separating Shahabad from Mirzapur District; it then flows through Mirzapur for about 15 miles northwards; after which it runs north-eastwards, again marking the boundary between Shahabad and the North-Western Provinces, until it falls into the right bank of the Ganges near Chausa, in lat. 25\u00b0 31' N., long. 83\u00b0 55' E., after a total course of about 146 miles. Its tributaries are the Durgauti and Dharmauti rivers, small streams which fall into its right bank. In the hills, the bed of the Karamnasa is rocky, and its banks abrupt; but as it debouches upon the plains, it sinks deeply into a rich clay, very retentive of moisture. The stream\nis here about 150 yards wide. By the end of February, the river generally runs dry, but during the rainy season boats of about 2 tons burden can proceed as far up as its confluence with the Durgauti. Near Chaus\u00e1, the East Indian Railway crosses it on a stone bridge. At Chhanpathar, in its course through Mirz\u00e1pur District, the river forms a waterfall 100 feet high, which, after heavy rains, affords a magnificent sight.\n\nThe river is held in the utmost abhorrence by Hindus, and no person of any caste will drink or even touch its waters, except persons permanently residing on its banks, who freely use the water, and are said to be exempt from the consequences of its impurity. The legendary reason of its impurity is said to be that a Br\u00e1hman having been murdered by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Trisanku, of the Solar line, a saint purified him of his sin by collecting water from all the streams in the world, and washing him in their waters, which were collected in the spring from which the Karamn\u00e1sa now issues. This spot is near the village of S\u00e1rodag, and the river soon becomes a rapid streamlet of beautifully clear water with deep holes, and abounding in fish. The true reason of the evil reputation of the Karamn\u00e1sa is that at one time it formed the boundary between the ancient Aryan colonies of the north and the still unsubdued aboriginal tribes of the east. Br\u00e1hmans or other Aryan castes who crossed the Karamn\u00e1sa in that early period passed into regions destitute of \u2018religious merit.\u2019\n\nKaranb\u00e1s.\u2014Town in An\u00fapshahr taluk, Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces; situated on the right bank of the Ganges, 12 miles south-east of An\u00fapshahr, and 30 miles south-east of Bulandshahr town. Population (1881) 1921, almost all Hindus. The zamind\u00e1rs are wealthy Hindus of the Bais clan of R\u00e1jputs. The fair held here on the occasion of the Dasahara, in the month of Jaistha (May\u2013June), is attended by perhaps as many as 50,000 pilgrims from the west, and is said to be the largest fair in the District. A small temple on an ancient site, sacred to the goddess of small-pox, is visited every Monday by numbers of women.\n\nKaranguli (Carunguli).\u2014Town in Madhur\u00e1ntakam taluk or Subdivision of Chengalpat District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 12\u00b0 32' N., long. 79\u00b0 56' 40\" E. Situated on the Great Southern Trunk Road, 48 miles distant from Madras. Population (1871) 2978; (1881) 3160, namely, 1560 males and 1600 females, occupying 407 houses. Hindus numbered 2969; Muhammadans, 162; and Christians, 29. The head-quarters of the District from 1795 to 1825; and once the kash\u00e1 or head-quarters of a taluk. The site, low-lying and surrounded with a bamboo fence, is unhealthy, and particularly liable to cholera. Though the town is now unimportant, the fort of Karanguli was occupied as a strategic point during the Anglo-\nFrench wars of the Karnatic, being regarded as an outpost of Chengalpat, from which it is 15 miles distant to the south-west. These two places, with Wandiwash and Utremalur, formed a sort of quadrilateral on the line of attack between the seats of the two Governments of Madras and Pondicherry. As early as 1755 it was a point of dispute. In 1757 it was evacuated by the English in the face of advancing French troops. The following year the English attempted to recover it by surprise, but were repulsed with loss; a failure which was repeated in 1759. But a few months later, Colonel Coote, after a few days' bombardment, captured the fort. This was the first decisive action in the successful campaign of 1759-60, which led to the victory of Wandiwash. The circumference of the fort is 1500 yards, and encloses the remains of what were apparently once huge granaries for the storage of grain, the tribute to the Muhammadan Government out of the produce of the neighbourhood. The ramparts of the fort now supply stone for the building of local public works.\n\nKaranja (or Uran).\u2014Island, village, and petty division of Panwel Sub-division, Thana District, Bombay Presidency. Karanja, or, as better known, Uran Island, is situated in the south-east of Bombay harbour, and about 6 miles south-east of the Carnac Bandar of Bombay. On a clear day the island can be distinguished plainly, and apparently but a mile or two distant, from the Apollo Bandar in Bombay harbour. It is 8 miles long and 4 broad, and on the east is cut off from the mainland by the Bendkhal creek, which at high tide is filled through its whole length. The island consists of two rocky hills, between which stretch grass and rice lands, wooded with mango trees and palms. The creek to the east is broken up into several salt-pans, the officers connected with which are stationed at the village of Uran close by. Beside its rice crop, which is of considerable value, the two special exports of Karanja Island are salt, and mahua and date liquor. Salt is estimated to be worth \u00a3469,000, and the liquor \u00a3166,000 a year. The chief industry of the people, however, is fishing. The great area of the salt works, namely, about 3000 acres, the shining white pans, regular boundaries, and heaps of glistening salt, produce a curious effect to the eye. The salt-pans are not of recent date. Reference is made to them in 1638; and in 1820 they are noted as having produced 20,000 tons of salt. During the five years ending 1882, the salt export was about 51,125 tons, and the yearly revenue \u00a3271,934. There are 19 mahua distilleries on the island, all owned by Parsis. The flower is brought through Bombay from the Panch Mahals, and the revenue they annually return is about \u00a3115,000.\n\nThe water-supply is good, and is derived from reservoirs, and from many ponds and wells which hold water for several months after the\nrains. Of the reservoirs three may be noticed, one on the road-side half-way between Alora and Uran, a second between Uran and Karanja, and the third, the largest (about a quarter of a mile round), in Uran. The drinking water comes from springs.\n\nKaranja has passed under every form of rule and suffered every species of vicissitude. Under the Silh\u00e1ras, in the 12th century, the island was prosperous, with many villages and gardens. It formed part of Bassein Province, under the Portuguese, from 1530 to 1740; was fortified with two strongholds, one at Uran, the other on the top of its southern peak; and a hundred armed men were maintained as garrison. At the present day may still be seen the ruins of Portuguese hermitages and churches. In 1535 the island was in charge of the Franciscans. In 1613 it was the scene of a great riot. In 1670 it was plundered by a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 freebooter. In 1737 the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s finally occupied the place, and held it until 1774, when the English took possession.\n\nA metalled road runs along the whole east side of the island; and a road, 14\u00bd miles long, is being made between Uran and Panwel, to whose officials Karanja Island is subordinated as a petty division of 22 villages and one town, inclusive of three ports. The population of the island is included in the Census returns for 1881 with those of Panwel Sub-division. A steam ferry runs daily between Bombay and Mora, calling at Hog Island in the harbour, and at Ulva near Panwel, and returning the same day. Mora is the chief port of the island, where passengers land and embark for Bombay. Karanja is the name of a small fishing village in the south of no importance. The most noteworthy ruins are on the summit of Dronagiri, the southern of the two hill peaks, including the Portuguese fort, the guard-house, church, rock temple, and reservoir. On the east face of Kharavli (the north hill peak) is a Buddhist rock-cut chapel; at Uran town, the old Portuguese fort and churches; in the village of Sheva, a ruined church, of which the broken walls of the graveyard are the only trace.\n\nKaranja Island is a favourite resort of snipe and duck, and is almost daily visited by sportsmen from Bombay.\n\n**Karanja.**\u2014Customs division in Th\u00e1na District, Bombay Presidency. The customs division contains three ports, viz. Mora, Karanja, and Sheva, which division has been since 1881\u201382 officially named Uran (*q.v.*).\n\n**Karanja.**\u2014Port in Karanja (or Uran) petty division of Panwel Sub-division, Th\u00e1na District, Bombay Presidency. The port is now known as Uran (*q.v.*).\n\n**Karanja.**\u2014Town in Wardh\u00e1 *tahsil*, Wardh\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; situated on high land surrounded by hills, 41 miles north-west of Wardh\u00e1 town. Karanja was founded about 270 years ago by Naw\u00e1b Muhammad Kh\u00e1n Ni\u00e1zi of Ashti. It is situated on high land sur-\nrounded by hills, but in the intervening valleys are some fine garden lands growing sugar and opium. The population, consisting principally of cultivators, traders, and weavers, numbered in 1881, 3220, made up as follows:\u2014Hindus, 3070; Muhammadans, 148; and aboriginal tribes, 2. Market and school. A good road connects the town with the high road from Nagpur to Amraoti.\n\nKaranja.\u2014Town in Amraoti District, Berar. Lat. 20\u00b0 29' N., long. 77\u00b0 32' E. Population (1867) 11,750; (1881) 10,923, namely, 5631 males and 5292 females. Of the total population, 7689 were returned as Hindus, 2625 Muhammadans, 603 Jains, 3 Parsis, 2 Sikhs, and 1 Christian. A place of some commercial importance. It is said to take its name from an old Hindu saint, Karinj Rishi, who, being afflicted with a grievous disease, invoked the aid of the goddess Amba, who created for him a tank (still existing opposite the temple of the goddess), in which he bathed and became clean. The wall round the town, built many years ago, is now dilapidated. There is a travellers\u2019 bungalow, which was built when the postal road from Nagpur ran through the town. Several ancient temples, the carved woodwork of which is greatly admired.\n\nKaran Khera.\u2014Village in Jagamanpur jagir, Jalaun District, North-Western Provinces; situated in lat. 26\u00b0 20' N., and long. 79\u00b0 34' E., on the right bank of the Jumna (Jamuna), the channel of which is here obstructed by rocks of kankar or calcareous conglomerate, which seriously interfere with navigation.\n\nKaranpura.\u2014Coal-field in Hazaribagh District, Bengal; lies between 23\u00b0 37' and 23\u00b0 57' N. lat., and between 84\u00b0 51' and 85\u00b0 30' E. long. Area, 472 square miles; greatest length, 42 miles; breadth, 19 miles. It is divided into two tracts by the Damodar river, and in point of size is inferior only to the Raniganj field of all the coal-fields of the Damodar valley, although not so important economically as either the Karharbari, Bokaro, or Jharia fields. The seams decrease in number in going from east to west. The coal series represented in the field are the Talcher, Damodar, and Panchet. The probable amount of available fuel, after making deductions for \u2018partings,\u2019 and calculating on a coal-bearing area of 250 square miles in the total of 472 included in the field, has been estimated at 8.4 billions of tons in the northern, and 7.5 million tons in the southern field. Regarding the quality, the following assay may be taken as giving a fair measure of the better class of coals:\u2014Carbon, 64.5; volatile matter, 27.0; ash, 8.5. The amount of ash compares favourably with the ordinary Damodar coals. Iron-ores of good quality occur in abundance in the field, and the manufacture of iron forms one of the industrial features of Hazaribagh District, where many villages are inhabited solely by iron-smelters. Limestone is found along the edge of the field in many places, but not\nin sufficient quantity to be available as a flux for large ironworks for a lengthened period.\n\nKarat\u00f3y\u00e1.\u2014River of Northern Bengal, rising in the Baikunthpur jungle in the extreme north-west of Jalp\u00e1gur\u00ed District, whence it follows a very winding southerly course into and through Rangpur, until it joins its waters with the Halh\u00e1l\u00eda in the south of Bogra District, and the united stream becomes the Phuljhur. The topography of this river is attended with numerous difficulties. The vagaries of the T\u00edst\u00e1 in the last century have left behind a maze of old watercourses and stagnant marshes, so as to render it nearly impossible to trace the course of former rivers. Changes of name are numerous, and in many places an old channel of the T\u00edst\u00e1 is known indifferently as the Bur\u00ed T\u00edst\u00e1 and as the Karto or Karat\u00f3y\u00e1. That stream ultimately joins the Atr\u00e4i; but the Karat\u00f3y\u00e1 proper, as above stated, becomes the Phuljhur. It was formerly a first-class river, but is now of minor importance for navigation.\n\nKarattan\u00e1d.\u2014One of the ancient chieftainships (n\u00e1ds) into which Mal\u00e1b\u00e1r District of the Madras Presidency was formerly divided; situated between 11\u00b0 36' and 11\u00b0 48' N. lat., and between 75\u00b0 36' and 75\u00b0 52' E. long.; stretching from the sea-coast up the western declivity of the Western Gh\u00e1ts. The level tracts near the sea are very fertile, but suffered to such an extent from the devastations of Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, that the people were unable to raise grain sufficient for their support. The eastern hilly parts are well wooded, and contain indigenous cardamom plants. The petty State was founded in 1564 by a Nair chief, who probably inherited it (in the male line) from the Tekk\u0101lank\u00far (Southern Regent) of the Kolattiri kingdom; and he and his successors ruled the country until the invasion of Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n. On the expulsion of Tip\u00fa in 1792, the Nair R\u00e1j\u00e1 was restored, and his family have held the State ever since. Population, principally Nairs. Chief town, Kuttipuram; lat. 11\u00b0 42' N., long. 75\u00b0 44' E.\n\nKarauli (Kerowlee).\u2014Native State in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, under the political superintendence of the Bhartpur (Bhurtpore) and Karauli Agency; lies between 26\u00b0 3' and 26\u00b0 49' N. lat., and between 76\u00b0 35' and 77\u00b0 26' E. long. The river Chambal forms the south-eastern boundary of the State, dividing it from Gwalior (Sindhia's territory). On the south-west and west it is bounded by Jaipur (Jeypore), and on the north and north-east by the States of Bhartpur (Bhurtpore) and Dholpur respectively. Area, 1208 miles. Population (1881) 148,670 persons.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Hills and broken ground characterize almost the whole territory, which lies within a tract locally termed the 'D\u00e1ng,' being the name given to the rugged region which lies above the narrow valley of the Chambal. The principal hills in the State are on the\nnorthern border, where several ranges run along or parallel to the frontier line, forming formidable barriers; but there are no lofty peaks, the highest being less than 1,400 feet above sea-level. There is little beauty in these hills, but the military advantages they present caused the selection of one of their eminences as the seat of Jadun rule in early times. Along the valley of the Chambal an irregular and lofty wall of rock separates the lands on the river bank from the uplands, of which the southern part of the State consists. From the summits of the passes fine views are often obtainable, the rocks standing out in striking contrast to the comparatively rich and undulating plain below, through which winds the glittering river. For some miles the country north of these passes is high, and too rocky to be deeply cut by ravines or to be pierced for water, and the few inhabitants depend upon tanks and dams; but farther north the country falls, the alluvial deposit is deeper, level ground becomes more frequent, and hills stand out more markedly, while in the neighbourhood of the city of Karauli (Kerowlee) the low ground is cut into a labyrinth of ravines.\n\nThe river Chambal, sometimes deep and slow, sometimes too rocky and rapid to admit of the safe passage of a boat, receives during the rains numerous contributions to its volume, but no considerable perennial stream flows into it within the boundaries of Karauli. The Panchnad is the only river which rises in the State, and this does not flow into the Chambal. It is so called from its being formed of five streams, which unite 2 miles north of the city. All these five rivulets rise in Karauli territory, and all but one contain water in dry weather, though often only a few inches in depth. The Panchnad winds away to the north and ultimately joins the Banganga. The Kalisur or Dangir and the Jiota Nadi drain the country to the south-west of the city. Both are insignificant streams, dry or nearly so most of the year, and flowing into the Morel on the Jaipur border. The sub-surface water throughout the territory is for the most part good. That of the tanks in the high rocky country, above the passes leading into the valley of the Chambal, becomes unwholesome in the hot weather; and the inhabitants often move down with their cattle to the banks of the Chambal, the waters of which, however, have a bad reputation for drinking purposes.\n\nGeology.\u2014The rocks in this territory belong to two series\u2014viz. the Vindhyan and the Quartzites. The latter are only exposed in a narrow ridge extending in a south-westerly direction from Baoli, situated about 8 miles south-west of the city of Karauli, to the Banas river. The rocks of the Vindhyan series cover a large area on both sides of this ridge of quartzites. On the south-east side they form the high land extending in that direction as far as the Chambal. The grand scarp on the left bank of the Chambal, rising in places to upwards\nof a thousand feet above the river, is formed entirely of the highest group of this series,\u2014the Bh\u00e1nrers, which cover a larger area than all the other groups put together. In fact, they cover the whole of Karauli, with the exception of that portion north-west of the quartzite ridge. Over the greater part of this area, the Bh\u00e1nrers are nearly horizontal, but along a portion of their north-western boundary they are a good deal contorted. The Bh\u00e1nrer sandstones are generally very fine in texture, but in some places there are coarse, almost conglomeratic beds. In colour they are purple, white, yellow, and red, with patches or spots of white. The last is the common variety. In the grand scarp on the left bank of the Chambal, a good section of the Bh\u00e1nrers is exposed. The limestone is light blue, brownish, or yellow in colour; in places largely crystalline, and often containing strings and veins of calcite; the lower beds sometimes include bands and nodules of chert. Above the limestone to the top of the scarp there are between 600 and 700 feet of the Sirbu shales, consisting of several alternations of shales and sandstones.\n\nThe Vindhyans on the north-west side of the quartzite ridge belong to the two lowest groups of the upper Vindhyas, namely, the K\u00e1imur and the Rew\u00e1. The mineral resources of the Vindhyan rocks are chiefly confined to building stone of excellent quality, and limestone. The palace of Fatehpur Sikri, and portions of the T\u00e1j Mahal at Agra, are built of the upper Bh\u00e1nrer sandstone, quarried a short distance from Karauli. The Bh\u00e1nrer limestone is in many places largely burned for lime. Through the greater portion of the State red sandstone abounds, and in parts, near the city especially, white sandstone blends with it. In many localities the villages are built entirely of stone, the roofs even being formed of loosely-placed, overlapping slabs. Iron-ore is found in the hills north-east of Karauli, but the mines will not pay working expenses; and the iron manufactured in the State is smelted from imported ore.\n\nForest and Jungle Products.\u2014The hills of Karauli, especially the higher ones, are generally bare of trees, but there are many exceptions. Above the Chambal valley, the commonest tree growing in any quantity together is the d\u00e1o (Lythrum fruticosum), which is scarcely more than a shrub. Other common trees are the dh\u00e1k (Butea frondosa), several kinds of acacias, and also the cotton-tree (Bombax), the s\u00e1l (Shorea robusta), the garjan (Dipterocarpus alatus), and the n\u00edm (Melia azadirachta). But the more valuable timber-trees are not numerous anywhere throughout the State. There is no forest, but groves of trees producing timber for the city are grown some 10 miles south-west of Karauli.\n\nFauna.\u2014In the wooded glens near the Chambal, there are tigers, bears, s\u00e1mbhar, nilg\u00e1i, and deer. In the uplands, also, game is\nfound near water, but it is nowhere abundant. In the neighbourhood of the town there are several covers for game and grass preserves. Hares, brown partridge, quail, and golden plover are the most common kinds of small game. In the large tanks water-fowl are to be found; and in the Chambal wild geese, cranes and wild duck abound, and also otters and crocodiles. In the west of the State snakes are numerous; near the city there are few. Fish are plentiful in the Chambal, in the streams near the city, and in the larger tanks.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The total population of the State in 1874 was estimated at about 149,000, calculated from a return of the number of houses in the State, five individuals being allowed to each house. This estimate appears to have been a close approximation to the truth, for the regular Census of 1881, taken on the 17th February, returned the total population at 148,670; the males numbering 80,645, the females 68,025; dwelling in 1 town and 861 villages; number of houses, 25,930; number of persons per house, 5\u00b77; number of persons per square mile, 123. Classified according to religion, the Hindus numbered 139,237; Muhammadans, 8836; Jains, 580; and Christians, 17. Among the Hindus are included 22,174 Br\u00e1hmans, 8182 R\u00e1jputs, 9620 Mah\u00e1jans and Baniy\u00e1s, 15,112 Gujars, 27,819 M\u00ednas, 18,278 Cham\u00e1rs, 808 J\u00e1ts, and 37,244 \u2018others.\u2019 The bulk of the Br\u00e1hmans are petty traders, who carry their merchandise on small pack-cattle, which are their own property. The M\u00ednas, who are cultivators, form the most numerous class in the State. The R\u00e1jputs, though numerically few, constitute the most important class. They are almost entirely composed of families of the J\u00e1dun clan (to which the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja belongs); and, like other R\u00e1jputs, the J\u00e1dun is a brave soldier, but a bad agriculturist. The feudal aristocracy of the State consists entirely of J\u00e1dun th\u00e1kurs (nobles) connected with the ruling house. They pay a tribute in lieu of constant military service, which is not performed in Karauli; but on military or State emergency they are bound to attend with their retainers, who on these occasions are maintained at the expense of the R\u00e1j\u00e1. The number of Muhammadans is insignificant everywhere but in the city of Karauli, where Path\u00e1ns compose the most trusted portion of the State troops. The worship of Vish\u1e47u under the name of Krishna is the prevalent form of religion among the Hindus.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The soil throughout the State is generally light. Except on the banks of the Chambal, where wheat, barley, gram, and tobacco are grown, and in the rocky tracts above, where rice is the chief product, bajra (Pennisetum typhoideum) and jodr (Sorghum vulgare) cover a larger portion of the cultivated area than any other crops, and form the staple food of the population. Sugar-cane is grown on a small scale, but it is not of a fine kind.\nHemp is grown extensively in the neighbourhood of the city of Karauli. There are three modes of irrigation\u2014from tanks, from wells, and from the rise of the Chambal. Tanks, formed by dams being thrown across the line of rain-drainage, are the principal means of irrigation in the rocky and hilly portions of Karauli. In the beds of these tanks rice is grown in the rainy season, and the stored water often makes possible a grain crop in the spring. Well irrigation is chiefly employed in the country surrounding the capital. In the valley of the Chambal, it is only on the verge of the receding water that a crop can be produced through the influence of the river. The banks are usually too high to place the water-line within the reach of irrigating wells. A temporary settlement, based on the payments of the five years ending 1882, is in operation.\n\nManufactures and Trade.\u2014There are very few manufactures in Karauli; a little weaving, dyeing, some wood-turning and stone-cutting form the employment of a small class, but the people are almost exclusively agriculturists. The principal imports are piece-goods, salt, sugar, cotton, buffaloes, and bullocks; the chief exports are rice, cotton, and goats.\n\nAdministration.\u2014A considerable part of the revenue is raised from customs, although, of course, the land revenue brings in the greater portion. The gross revenue of Karauli in 1881 amounted to \u00a348,381, and the expenditure to \u00a342,958. There is no regular police force in the State, with the exception of a small body of 25 men kept up in the city for that purpose. The police duties in the rural parts are performed by the troops. Judicial work is carried on in the criminal court at Karauli and in the tahsildars' courts. There is a central jail at Karauli city, where there is also a post-office and a mint at which silver coins are struck. The Karauli rupee is about equal in value to the British rupee. An English and Persian school was established at the capital in 1864, where there are also 7 Hindu schools. Education in the State is generally backward. There is one well-appointed hospital in the city of Karauli, but there are no dispensaries in the outlying tracts. The erection of dispensaries at Mandrel, Sapotra, and Machilpur is contemplated. A military force is maintained of 160 cavalry, 1770 infantry, 32 artillerymen, with 40 light guns. These troops hold the following 12 masonry forts of the State, viz. Karauli city, Uthgarh, Mandrel, Naroli, Sapotra, Daulatpura, Th\u00e1li, Jamb\u00fara, Kh\u00fada, Ninda, Und, and Khodai.\n\nClimate, etc.\u2014The rainfall at Karauli city amounted to 30\u00b78 inches in 1881. Fever, dysentery, and rheumatism are the prevailing diseases. Epidemic disease rarely penetrates into the State.\n\nHistory.\u2014The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Karauli, Arjun P\u00e1l, is the head of the J\u00e1dun clan of R\u00e1jputs, who claim descent from Krishna, and are\nregarded as Yaduvansi, or descendants of the moon. The clan has always remained in or near the country of Braj round Muttra (Mathura), and once held Bi\u00e1na, which was taken from them by the Muhammadans in 1053 A.D. In 1454, Karauli was conquered by Mahm\u00fad Khilj\u00ed, King of M\u00e1lw\u00e1. After the conquest of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 by Akbar, the State became incorporated with the Delhi Empire; and on the decline of the Mughal power it appears to have been so far subjugated by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s that they exacted from it a tribute of \u00a32500 annually. This tribute was transferred to the British in 1817 by the Peshw\u00e1, and was remitted by Government on the engagement of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 to furnish troops according to his means on the requisition of the British Government; at the same time, the State was taken under British protection.\n\nIn 1852, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Narsingh P\u00e1l died, and there being no direct successor, the question was debated whether the State should lapse to the British Government. It was finally determined to preserve the succession; and an heir was found in Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Madan P\u00e1l, who during the Mutiny of 1857 evinced a loyal spirit, and eventually sent a body of troops against the Kotah mutineers. For these services he was created a G.C.S.I.; his salute was raised from 15 to 17 guns for his lifetime; a debt of \u00a311,700 due by him to the British Government was remitted, and a dress of honour conferred. Madan P\u00e1l died in 1869, and the three chiefs who have succeeded him have each been selected by adoption. In 1883, a Council of regency, divided into three departments, conducted the internal administration of the State.\n\nKarauli (Kerowlee).\u2014Capital of the Native State of Karauli, in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; situated about 75 miles equidistant from Muttra, Gwalior, Agra, Alwar (Ulwur), Jaipur (Jeypore), and Tonk. Lat. 26\u00b0 30' N., long. 77\u00b0 4' E. It is said to derive its name from Kali\u00e1nj\u00ed, a temple built by Arjun Deo, who likewise founded the city, about A.D. 1348. But it did not prosper, owing to the depredations of the M\u00edn\u00e1s, until these were put down by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Gop\u00e1l D\u00e1s, in whose reign Karauli became a considerable town, and fine buildings began to spring up. In 1881 the population was returned at 25,607 souls; Hindus numbering 19,829; Muhammadans, 5339; and \u2018others,\u2019 439.\n\nViewed from points whence the palace is seen to advantage, the town has a striking appearance. It is surrounded by a wall of sandstone, and is also protected on the north and east by deep winding ravines, cut by the action of water in the level plain. These, if properly defended, would probably prove an insuperable obstacle to unscientific invaders. To the south and west, the ground is comparatively level, but advantage has been taken of a conveniently situated watercourse to form a moat to the city wall; while an outer wall and ditch defended\nby bastions has been carried along the other bank, so forming a double line of defence. These fortifications are due to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Gop\u00e1l D\u00e1s, and though too strong for the desultory attacks of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, would be far less formidable to regular troops than were the mud walls of Bhartpur.\n\nThe sandstone wall of Karauli, in spite of its handsome appearance, is unsubstantially built, being composed of ill-cemented stones, faced by thin slabs after the fashion which prevails throughout the State wherever sandstone is abundant and buildings of any pretension are erected. The circumference of the town is somewhat under 2\u00bd miles, and it contains 6 gates, besides 11 posterns. Br\u00e1hmins and Mah\u00e1jans are the most important classes. The streets are narrow and irregular, impassable for carriages, and difficult for any wheeled conveyance. The late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Jai Singh P\u00e1l made a commencement of paving the streets, and built an extensive sard\u00ed for the accommodation of merchants and travellers. The most striking characteristic is the superabundance of sandstone, as the sole building material. The roofs of the poorer houses are formed of slabs, sloping and overlapping one another very roughly, but not ineffectively arranged, and supported by logs of wood or long triangular pieces of stone. The principal b\u00e1z\u00e1r stretches east from the westernmost gate towards the palace. It is about half a mile in length, but irregular and wanting in neatness. There are many costly houses and handsome temples.\n\nThe palace is 200 yards from the eastern wall of the city, and occupies a space of about 150 yards square. In its present state it was erected by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Gop\u00e1l D\u00e1s. The whole block of buildings is surrounded by a lofty bastioned wall, in which there are two fine gates. Within the palace, the Rang Mahal and Diw\u00e1n-i-Am, with their mirrors and fine colours, are beautiful specimens of native ornament. The Madan Mohanj\u00ed, though the chief temple in the town, is of no great beauty. The Saroman temple is a handsome building of red sandstone, decorated with elegant tracery, in the modern Muttra style. The principal gardens are those of Shik\u00e1rganj, Shik\u00e1r Mahal, and Khawas Mahal. European visitors are generally accommodated in the building within the Khawas Mahal. Post-office, dispensary, and school.\n\nKarchh\u00e1na (or Arail).\u2014The central tahsil of the three tahsils to the south of the Jumna in Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces. It is conterminous with pargan\u00e1 Arail, and is surrounded on the north, east, and south by the Jumna, Ganges, and Tons rivers, and bounded on the west by B\u00e1rah tahsil. Karchh\u00e1na is an irregular-shaped tract, consisting of lands of a very varied character. To the extreme west, the stone hills and black soil valleys of B\u00e1rah tahsil are\nfound in a few villages; but most of the land on the B\u00e1r\u00e1h borders is low-lying clay soil (matiy\u00e1r). A strip of fine level loam running north-west and south-east lies north of the clay tract, and extends to the confluence of the Ganges and the Tons. East of this is a low-lying tract of land, flanked by a high bank, evidently an old bed of the Ganges. Water lies close to the surface, and the land is so moist as to dispense with the necessity for irrigation. Except this low-lying tract, the country along the three rivers consists of strips of high-lying, undulating land, much cut up by drainage lines. Below these, on the Ganges and Jumna, there are at intervals patches of rich alluvial land and large tracts of sandy waste. There is also a tract of alluvial land at the confluence of the Ganges and the Tons, and two islands in the bed of the former river. These are liable at any time to have their value largely increased by alluvial deposits; or, on the other hand, to be entirely washed away by floods.\n\nThe original inhabitants of the tahsil are said to have been Bhars, and traces of them still remain in the ruined mounds of earth and brick which mark the site of their forts. From the western portion along the Jumna, the Bhars were driven by Ir\u00e1dat Kh\u00e1n, the reputed ancestor of the present Path\u00e1n zamind\u00e1rs. The northern portion along the Ganges was taken by Bais R\u00e1jputs, whose descendants claim to have held their land since the days of Akbar. The east of the tahsil was occupied by Hir\u00e1puri P\u00e1ndes; and the south by a branch of the Kanauj royal family of Gaharw\u00e1r R\u00e1jputs. The predominating cultivating classes at the present day are Br\u00e1hmans, Kurmis, R\u00e1jputs, and Ah\u00edrs.\n\nKarchh\u00e1na tahsil is densely populated, with a pressure of 471\u00b78 persons per square mile. Total population (1881) 124,094, namely, 62,698 males and 61,396 females. Hindus numbered 115,113; Muhammadans, 8942; Jains, 2; and Christians, 37. Of the 339 villages, 265 contained less than five hundred inhabitants, and only one had upwards of three thousand. Area of the tahsil, 263 square miles, of which 169 square miles are cultivated, 45 square miles are cultivable, and 49 square miles barren and waste. Government land revenue (1881), \u00a326,663, or including local rates and cesses levied on land, \u00a331,149. Amount of rent, including cesses paid by cultivators, \u00a344,432. The tahsil is intersected by the main line of the East Indian Railway, and by the Jabalpur extension of the same line. The metalled high road between Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d and N\u00e1gpur runs through the west of the tahsil, which is also crossed by several good unmetalled roads. In 1883, the tahsil contained one criminal court, with two police stations (tahsils); strength of regular police, 33 men, with 261 chaukidd\u00e1rs or village watchmen.\n\nKarchh\u00e1na.\u2014Village in Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Pro-\nvinces, and head-quarters of Karchh\u00e1na tahsil; situated 13 miles southeast of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d city, with which it is connected by an unmetalled road. Lat. $25^\\circ 17' 2''$ N., long. $81^\\circ 57' 32''$ E. A neat little village, with a population of 801 souls, and a station on the East Indian Railway. Besides the usual sub-divisional courts and offices, the village contains an imperial post-office, police station, and Anglo-veracular school.\n\n**Kardong.**\u2014Village in K\u00e1ngra District, Punjab, in the Sub-division of L\u00e1hul. Lies on the left bank of the Bh\u00e1ga, almost immediately opposite Kielang. It is the largest and most striking village in the L\u00e1hul valley, with better built houses than in other villages.\n\nEND OF VOLUME VII.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created":
