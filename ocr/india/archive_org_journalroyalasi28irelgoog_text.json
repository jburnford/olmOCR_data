Muir, Esq.\n\nTHE ASVINS.\n\nThe Asvins seem to have been a puzzle even to the oldest Indian Commentators. Y\u0101ska thus refers to them in the Nirukta, xii. 1: \"Next in order are the deities whose sphere is the heaven; of these the Asvins are the first to arrive. They are called Asvins, because they pervade (vy\u0101\u015bnuv\u0101le) everything, the one with moisture, the other with light. Aurnabh\u0101va says they are called Asvins, from the horses (a\u1e63vai\u1e25, on which they ride). Who, then, are these Asvins? 'Heaven and Earth,' say some; 'Day and Night,' say others; 'The Sun and Moon,' say others; 'Two kings, performers of holy acts,' say the legendary writers. Their time is subsequent to midnight, whilst the manifestation of light is delayed; [and ends with the rising of the sun, ibid. xii. 5]. The dark portion [of this time] denotes the intermediate (god, = Indra), the light portion Aditya (the Sun).\"\u00b9 Professor Roth, on the strength of this passage considers that Y\u0101ska identifies the two Asvins with Indra and the Sun (Illustrations of Nirukta, p. 159).\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 See the different interpretation given by Professor Goldst\u00fccker, below.\n\u00b2 R. V. i. 181, 4, is quoted by Y\u0101ska in illustration of his view:\u2014\"Born here and there, these two have striven forward (?) with spotless bodies according to their respective characters. One of you, a conqueror and a sage [is the son of] the strong one (?); the other is born onward, the son of the sky.\" Comp. Roth's transl. in illustration of Nirukta, p. 169.\nIn the Journal of the German Oriental Society, iv. 425, the same author thus speaks of these gods: \"The two A\u1e63vins, though, like the ancient interpreters of the Veda, we are by no means agreed as to the conception of their character, hold, nevertheless, a perfectly distinct position in the entire body of the Vedic deities of light. They are the earliest bringers of light in the morning sky, who in their chariot hasten onward before the dawn, and prepare the way for her.\"\u00b9\n\nIn a passage of the R. V., x. 17, 2 (quoted in my paper on Yama, p. 288), the A\u1e63vins are represented as the twin sons of Vivasvat and Saranyu. They are also called the sons of the sky (divo nap\u0101t\u0101) in R. V., i. 182, 1; i. 184, 1;\u00b2 x. 61, 4; and in i. 46, 2 sindhum\u0101t\u0101ra, the offspring of the Ocean\u00b3 (whether aerial or terrestrial). In viii. 75, 1, they are said to have sprung (?) from the word of Daksha.\n\nIn i. 180, 2, the sister of the A\u1e63vins is mentioned, by whom the Commentator naturally understands Ushas. In vii. 71, 1, Ushas appears to be called the Sister of Night, whilst in i. 123, 5, she is said to be the sister of Bhaga and Varu\u1e47a.\n\nThe A\u1e63vins are in many parts of the R. V. connected with S\u016bry\u0101, the youthful daughter of the sun (called also in one place, i. 119, 2, Urj\u0101n\u012b (?)), who is represented as having chosen them for her husbands (i. 119, 5; iv. 43, 6; vii. 69, 3; comp. x. 39, 11); and as having eagerly ascended their chariot (i. 34, 5; i. 116, 17; i. 117, 13; i. 118, 5; iv. 43, 2, 6; v. 73, 5; vi. 63, 5 f.; vii. 68, 3; vii. 69, 4; viii. 8, 10; viii. 22, 1; comp. viii. 29, 8).\u2074\n\nThe commentator (on i. 116, 17) following the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, explains these allusions by saying that Savitri had destined his daughter S\u016bry\u0101 to be the wife of Soma. But all the gods were anxious to obtain her hand, and resolved that the victor\n\n\u00b9 For some speculations of Professors M\u00fcller and Weber, on the A\u1e63vins, see the lectures of the former, 2nd series, p. 489, f, and the Indische Studien of the latter, vol. v., p. 234.\n\u00b2 In i. 181. 4, only one of them is said to be the son of the sky.\n\u00b3 On this the commentator remarks that although it is the Sun and Moon that are sprung from the sea, yet the same epithet applies equally to the A\u1e63vins who in the opinion of some are identical with the former.\n\u2074 See also A. V. vi. 82, 2.\nin a race which they agreed to run, should get her. She was accordingly won by the A\u1e63vins, and ascended their chariot.\n\nAllusion is also made to S\u016bry\u0101 in connection with the A\u1e63vins in x. 85, 9, where, however, they no longer appear as her husbands: \"Soma was the wooer, the A\u1e63vins were the two friends of the bridegroom,\" when Savitri gave to her husband S\u016bry\u0101 consenting in her mind . . . . 14. When ye came, A\u1e63vins, to the marriage procession of S\u016bry\u0101, to make enquiries, all the gods approved, and P\u016bshan as a son chose you for his parents.\"\n\nThe daughter of the Sun is connected with the Soma plant in ix. 1, 6: \"The Daughter of the Sun purifies thy distilled Soma,\" etc.; and in ix. 113, 3, she is said to have brought it after it had been expanded by the rain.\n\nIf we look on Soma as the plant of that name, the connection between it and S\u016bry\u0101 is not very clear; but if Soma be taken for the moon, as he appears to be in x. 85, 3 (\"When they crush the plant, he who drinks fancies that he has drunk Soma; but no one tastes of him whom the priests know to be Soma,\") it is not unnatural, from the relation of the two luminaries, that he should have been regarded as son-in-law of the sun.\n\nThe A\u1e63vins are described as coming from afar, from the sky or from the lower air (i. 22, 2; iv. 44, 5; viii. 5, 30; viii. 8, 3, 4, 7); or as arriving from different unknown quarters, whether above or below, far or near (v. 73, 1; v. 74, 10; vii. 70, 3; vii. 72, 5; viii. 9, 2; viii. 10, 1, 5; viii. 26, 17; viii. 62, 5). Sometimes the worshipper enquires after their locality (i. 184, 1; v. 74, 2, 3; vi. 63, 1; viii. 62, 4). In one place (viii. 8, 23,) they are said to have three stations. The time of their appearance is properly the early dawn, when they yoke their horses to their car and descend to earth to receive the adorations and offerings of their votaries (i. 22, 1;\n\n1 Comp. A.V. xi. 8, 1, \"when Manyu brought his bride from the house of Sankalpa, who were the bridegroom's friends?\" etc.\n2 Weber asks (Ind. S. v. 183, 187,) whether P\u016bshan here is not meant to designate Soma the bridegroom. In vi. 68, 4, the gods are said to have given P\u016bshan to S\u016bry\u0101.\n3 See the part of my former paper referring to Soma, p. 140; and Weber's Ind. Stud. v. 179.\ni. 184, 1; iv. 45, 2; vii. 67, 2; vii. 69, 5; vii. 71, 1-3; vii. 72, 4; vii. 73, 1; viii. 5, 1, 2; viii. 9, 17; x. 39, 12; x. 40, 1, 3; x. 41, 1, 2; x. 61, 4). In i. 34, 10, Savitri is said to put their car in motion before the dawn. In other passages their time is not so well defined. Thus, in i. 157, 1, it is said: \"Agni has awoken; the sun rises from the earth; the great and bright Ushas has dawned with her light; the Asvins have yoked their car to go; the divine Savitri has enlivened every part of the world.\" where both the break of dawn and the appearance of the Asvins appear to be made simultaneous with the rising of the sun. The same is the case in vii. 71, 4. In v. 76, 3, the Asvins are invited to come at different times of the day, and in viii. 22, 14, it is said that they are invoked in the evening and during the day, as well as at dawn. It need not, however, surprise us that they should be invited to attend the different ceremonies of the worshippers, and therefore conceived to appear at hours distinct from the natural periods of their manifestation.\n\nIt may seem unaccountable that two deities of a character so little defined, and so difficult to identify, as the Asvins, should have been the object of so enthusiastic a worship as appears from the numerous hymns dedicated to them in the R. V. to have been paid to them in ancient times. The reason may have been that they were hailed as the precursors of returning day, after the darkness and dangers of the night. In one passage (viii. 35, 16 ff.) they are represented as being, like Agni, the chasers away of evil spirits.\n\nThe Asvins are said to be young (vii. 67, 10), ancient (vi. 62, 5), beautiful (vi. 62, 5; vi. 63, 1), honey-hued (viii. 26, 6), lords of lustre (viii. 22, 14; x. 93, 6), bright (vii. 68, 1),\n\n1 vii. 67, 2, \"Agni, being kindled, has shone upon us; even the remotest ends of the darkness have been seen; the light preceding the dawn has been perceived, springing up for the glory of the daughter of heaven (Ushas). 3. Now, Asvins, the priest invokes you with his hymns,\" etc.\n\n2 viii. 5, 1, 2; \"When the rosy-hued dawn, though far away, gleams as if she were near at hand, she spreads the light in all directions. 2. Ye, Asvins, like men, follow after Ushas in your car which is yoked by thought, and shines afar.\"\n\n3 viii. 9, 17, \"Wake, o great and divine Ushas, the Asvins,\" etc.\n\n4 x. 39, 12, \"The daughter of the sky (the dawn) is born when your car is yoked; as are also day and night.\"\n\n5 x. 61, 4, when the dark [night] stands among the tawny cows (rays of dawn), I invoke you, Asvins, sons of the sky.\"\nof a golden brilliancy and sun-like radiance (viii. 8, 2), agile (vi. 63, 5), fleet as thought (viii. 22, 16), swift as falcons (v. 78, 4), possessed of many forms (i. 117, 9), wearing lotus garlands (x. 184, 2, and A. V. iii. 22, 4, \u00a7. P. Br. iv. 1, 5, 16); strong (x. 24, 4), mighty (vi. 62, 5), terrible, (rudr\u0101, v. 75, 3; x. 93, 7), skilful (m\u0101yin\u0101 or m\u0101y\u0101vin\u0101, vi. 63, 5; x. 24, 4), and profound in wisdom (viii. 8, 2). They are overthrowers of pride (viii. 22, 16); and traverse a golden (v. 75, 3,) or terrible (viii. 5, 11; viii. 8, 1; viii. 22, 1, 14; x. 39, 11), path.\n\nThe car, golden in all its various parts (i. 180, 1; iv. 44, 4, 5; v. 77, 3; viii. 5, 28, 29, 35; viii. 22, 9), on which they ride, flying as on bird\u2019s wings (i. 183, 1), was formed by the R\u012bbhus (x. 39, 12), and is singular in its formation, being three-wheeled, and triple in some other parts of its construction (triv\u1e5bt, trivandhura)\u00b2 (i. 34, 2, 9; i. 47, 2; i. 118, 1, 2; i. 157, 3; vii. 71, 4; viii. 74, 8; x. 41, 1; comp. iv. 36, 1).\n\nThis car moves lightly (viii. 9, 8) and is swifter than thought (i. 117, 2; i. 118, 1; v. 77, 3; vi. 63, 7; x. 39, 12), or than the twinkling of an eye (viii. 62, 2). It is decked with a thousand ornaments and banners (sahasra-nirnij, sahasra-ketu (i. 119, 1; viii. 8, 11, 14, 15) and has golden reins (viii. 22, 5). It is sometimes said to be drawn by a single ass, as the word r\u0101sabha\u00b3 is, in two places at least,\n\n\u00b9 Two epithets very commonly applied to them are daerd, and n\u0101satya. The former term is explained by S\u0101yana to signify destroyers of enemies, or of diseases (note on i. 3, 3), or beautiful (on viii. 75, 1). Professor Roth s.w. understands it to signify wonder-workers. The second word n\u0101satya is regarded by S\u0101yana, following one of the etymologies given by Y\u0101ska (vi. 13) as equivalent to saty\u0101, truthful. If this is the sense, saty\u0101 itself might as well have been used. In the later literature Dasra and N\u0101satya were regarded as the separate names of the two Aswins. See M\u00fcller's Lectures, 2nd Series, p. 491.\n\n\u00b2 The word vandhura is variously explained by S\u0101yana as nidabandhan\u0101dh\u0101ra-bh\u0113tam (on i. 34, 9), unnatnatarkya-bandhana-k\u0101khiham (on i. 47, 2), veda\u1e25titam \u015br\u0101tre\u1e25 ath\u0101nam (on i. 118, 1), \u015br\u0101try\u0101\u015br\u0101ya-sth\u0101nam (on i. 157, 3), \u015br\u0101try-adhisht\u0101na-sth\u0101nam (on vii. 71, 4), and trivandhura as triphalak\u1e63a\u1e45gha\u1e6dena (on viii. 74, 8). The epithet would thus mean either (1) having three perpendicular pieces of wood, or (2) having a triple standing place or seat for the charioteer. In i. 34, 2, the chariot is said to have three props fixed in it to lay hold of (tray\u0101\u1e25 skambh\u0101\u1e25 \u015bak\u1e63hiti\u015b dr\u0101bhe) which the commentator says were meant to secure the rider against the fear of falling when the chariot was moving rapidly. This explanation would coincide with one of the senses assigned to vandhura. In i. 181, 3, their chariot is called srpra-vandhurah, which according to the commentator is = vis\u1e5b\u1e47a-purabhadgah, \u201chaving a wide fore-part.\u201d\n\n\u00b3 See the legend in the \u0100itareya Brahmana, p. 270-273 of Dr. Haug's translation.\nexplained by the commentator (i. 34, 9; i. 116, 2; viii. 74, 7); but more frequently by fleet-winged, golden-winged, falcon-like, swan-like horses, (i. 46, 3; i. 117, 2; i. 118, 4, 5; i. 180, 1; i. 181, 2; iv. 45, 4; v. 75, 5; vi. 63, 7; vii. 69, 7; viii. 5, 7, 22, 33, 35; viii. 10, 2; x. 143, 5). They carry a honied whip (ka\u1e63\u1e6da madhumatt\u012b, i. 22, 3; i. 157, 4),\u00b9 and traverse the regions (tiro rajamsi, vii. 68, 3).\n\nThe A\u015bvins are fancifully represented as doing, or as being requested to do, a variety of acts thrice over, viz., to move thrice by night and thrice by day, to bestow food thrice at even and at dawn, to bestow wealth thrice, come to the worship of the gods thrice, to bestow celestial medicaments thrice, and earthly thrice, etc. (i. 34, 1 ff.; viii. 35, 7-9).\n\nThey are elsewhere compared to different twin objects, to two vultures on a tree, to two priests reciting hymns, to two goats, to two beautiful women, to husband and wife, to two ducks (chakrav\u0101k\u0101), to two ships, to two dogs, two eyes, two hands, two feet, two lips, two breasts, two noses, two ears, two swans, two falcons, two deer, two buffaloes, two wings of one bird, etc., etc. (ii. 39, 1 ff.; v. 78, 1-3; viii. 35, 7-9; x. 106, 2 ff.).\n\nThey are physicians\u00b2 and restore the blind, the lame, the emaciated, and the sick, to sight, power of locomotion, health, and strength (i. 34, 6; i. 116, 16; i. 157, 6; viii. 9, 6, 15; viii. 22, 10; viii. 75, 1; x. 39, 3, 5; x. 40, 8). See also A.V. vii. 53, 1, where it is said that the A\u015bvins are the physicians of the gods, and warded off death.\n\nThey place the productive germ in all creatures, and generate fire, water, and trees (i. 157, 5). They are connected with procreation and with love (x. 184, 2; x. 85, 26; A. V. ii. 30, 2; v. 25, 3; vi. 102, 1; xiv. 1, 36; xiv. 2, 5). See Weber's Ind. Stud. v. 219, 234.\n\nThe following are a few of the modes in which the divine\n\n\u00b9 See my paper on the \"Progress of Vedic Religion, etc.,\" p. 363. Indra has a golden whip, viii. 33, 11.\n\u00b2 In Taitt. Br. iii. 1, 2, 11, the A\u015bvins are called the physicians of the gods, the bearers of oblations, the messengers of the universe, the guardians of immortality; and in that and the preceding paragraph (10) they are connected with their own asterism (nak\u1e63atras), the A\u015bvayuj.\npower of the \u0100\u015bvins is declared in different hymns to have been manifested for the deliverance of their votaries.\n\nWhen the sage Chyav\u0101na had grown old, and had been forsaken, they divested him of his decrepit body, prolonged his life, and restored him to youth, making him acceptable to his wife, and the husband of maidens (i. 116, 10; i. 117, 13; i. 118, 6: v. 74, 5; v. 75, 5; vii. 68, 6; vii. 71, 5; x. 39, 4).\n\nThis legend is related at length in the S. P. Br. in a passage which will be cited further on.\n\nIn the same way they renewed the youth of Kali\u00b9 after he had grown old (x. 39, 8), and had married a wife (i. 112, 15).\n\nThey brought on a car to the youthful Vimada\u00b2 a bride (i. 112, 19; i. 116, 1) named Kamady\u016b (x. 65, 12), who seems to have been the chaste wife of Purumitra (i. 117, 20; x. 39, 7).\n\nThey restored Vi\u1e63\u1e47\u0101p\u016b, like a lost animal, to the sight of Vi\u1e63vaka, son of Krishna, their worshipping, who, according to the commentator, was his father (i. 116, 23; i. 117, 7; x. 65, 12).\n\nThe names both of Vi\u1e63vaka and Vi\u1e63\u1e47\u0101p\u016b occur in R. V. viii. 75, a hymn addressed to the \u0100\u015bvins; and the commentator connects the reference there made to them with the legend before us (on which, however, the hymn itself throws no light).\n\nAnother act recorded of the \u0100\u015bvins is their intervention in favour of Bhujyu, the son of Tugra, which is obscurely described in the following verses in R. V. i. 116, 3\u20135: \u201cTugra abandoned Bhujyu in the water-cloud, as any dead man leaves his property. Ye, \u0100\u015bvins, bore him in animated (\u0101tmanavatthih) water-tight ships, which traversed the air. 4. Three nights and three days did ye convey him in three flying cars, with a hundred feet, and six horses, which crossed over to the dry land beyond the liquid ocean. 5. Ye put forth your vigour in the ocean, which offers no stay, or standing-place, or support, when ye bore Bhujyu to his home, standing on a ship propelled by a hundred oars.\u201d R. V. i. 117, 14, 15: \u201cYe conveyed Bhujyu out of the liquid ocean with your\n\n\u00b9 The family of the Kalis is mentioned viii. 55, 15.\n\u00b2 A rishi of this name is mentioned R.V. viii. 9, 15; x. 20, 10; x. 23, 7; and a family of Vimadas in x. 23, 6.\nheadlong flying horses. 15. The son of Tugra invoked you, A\u1e63vins. Borne forward, he moved without distress over the sea. Ye brought him out with your well-yoked chariot swift as thought.\u201d Again in i. 182, 5 ff. it is said: \u201cYe (A\u1e63vins) made this animated (\u0101tmanvantam) winged boat for the son of Tugra among the waters... 6. Four ships, in eager haste (?) impelled by the A\u1e63vins, convey to the shore Tugra, who had been plunged in the waters, and sunk in bottomless darkness. 7. What was that log, placed in the midst of the waves, which the suppliant son of Tugra embraced, as the wings of a bird, for support?\u201d In vii. 68, 7, Bhujyu is said to have been abandoned by his malevolent companions in the middle of the sea. The story is also alluded to in i. 112, 6, 20; i. 118, 6; i. 119, 4; vi. 62, 6; vii. 69, 7; viii. 5, 22; x. 39, 4; x. 40, 7; x. 65, 12; x. 143, 5.\n\nAgain, when Vispal\u0101\u2019s leg had been cut off in battle, like the wing of a bird, the A\u1e63vins are said, when lauded by Agastya, to have given her an iron one instead (R. V. i. 112, 10; i. 116, 15; i. 117, 11; i. 118, 8; x. 39, 8).\u00b9\n\nThey restored sight to Rijr\u0101\u015bva, who had been made blind by his father for giving a hundred and one sheep to a she wolf to eat (i. 116, 16; i. 117, 17, 18). Rijr\u0101\u015bva is mentioned in i. 100, 17, as praising Indra.\n\nThey restored Par\u0101v\u1e5bj (or an outcast), who was blind and lame, to sight and the power of walking (i. 112, 8). Par\u0101v\u1e5bj is connected with Indra in ii. 13, 12, and ii. 15, 7.\n\nThe Rishi Rebha has been hidden by the malignant, bound, overwhelmed in the waters (a well, according to the commentator), for ten nights and nine days, and abandoned till he was nearly, if not entirely, dead. The A\u1e63vins drew him up as soma-juice is raised with a ladle, or as a pot full of gold is dug out of the earth (i. 112, 5; i. 116, 24; i. 117, 4, 12; i. 118, 6; i. 119, 6; x. 39, 9).\n\nVandana seems to have been delivered from a somewhat similar calamity according to i. 112, 5; i. 118, 6; x. 39, 8. According to i. 119, 6, 7, however, he would appear to have been restored from decrepitude. From i. 116, 11, and i. 117,\n\n\u00b9 Compare the word vispalivasi in R. V. i. 182, 1.\n5, it would seem as if some person or thing had been restored to him.\n\nSo, too, the A\u015bvins bestowed wisdom on their worshipper Kaksh\u012bvat, of the family of Pajra; and performed the notable miracle of causing a hundred jars of wine and honeyed liquor to flow forth from the hoof of their horse as from a sieve (i. 116, 7; i. 117, 6).\n\nWhen invoked by the popular sage Atri Saptavadhri, who had been plunged by the malice and arts of evil spirits into a gloomy and burning abyss, they speedily came to his assistance, mitigated the heat with cold, and supplied him with nutriment, so that his situation became tolerable, if not agreeable, till they eventually extricated him from his perilous position (i. 112, 7; i. 116, 8; i. 117, 3; i. 118, 7; i. 119, 6; v. 78, 4-6; vii. 71, 5; viii. 62, 8, 7-9; x. 39, 9). In x. 80, 3, the deliverance of Atri is ascribed to Agni.\n\nThey listened to the invocation of the wise Vadhrimat\u012b, and gave her a son called Hiranyahasta (i. 116, 13; i. 117, 24; vi. 62, 7; x. 39, 7).\n\nThey gave a husband to Ghosh\u0101 when she was growing old in her father's house (i. 117, 7; x. 39, 3, 6; x. 40); and, according to the commentator, cured her of the leprosy with which she had been afflicted (comp. i. 122, 5).\n\nThey caused the cow of the suppliant \u015aayu, which had left off bearing, to yield milk (i. 116, 22; i. 117, 20; i. 118, 8; i. 119, 6; x. 39, 13).\n\nThey gave to Pedu a strong, swift, white horse, of incomparable Indra-like prowess, which overcame all his enemies, and conquered for him unbounded spoils (i. 116, 6; i. 117, 9; i. 118, 9; i. 119, 10; vii. 71, 5; x. 39, 10).\n\nFinally, to say nothing of the succours rendered to numerous other persons (i. 112, 116, 117, 118, 119,) the A\u015bvins did not confine their benevolence to human beings, but are also celebrated as having rescued from the jaws of a wolf a quail by which they were invoked (i. 116, 14; i. 117, 16; i. 118, 8; x. 39, 13).\n\n1 See Roth's explanation of the words r\u016b\u1e63a and gharma, and his Illustrations of Nirukta, vi. 36.\nThe deliverances of Rebha, Vandana, Par\u0101v\u1e5bj, Bhujyu, Chyav\u0101na, and others are explained by Professor Benfey, (following Dr. Kuhn and Professor M\u00fcller) in the notes to his translations of the hymns in which they are mentioned, as referring to certain physical phenomena with which the A\u1e63vins are supposed by these scholars to be connected. But this allegorical method of interpretation seems unlikely to be correct, as it is difficult to suppose that the phenomena in question should have been alluded to under such a variety of names and circumstances. It appears therefore to be more probable that the Rishis merely refer to certain legends which were popularly current of interventions of the A\u1e63vins in behalf of the persons whose names are mentioned. The word Par\u0101v\u1e5bj (in i. 112, 8), which is taken by the commentator for a proper name, and is explained by Professors M\u00fcller\u00b9 and Benfey as the returning, or the setting, sun, is interpreted by Professor Roth in his Lexicon, s.v., as an outcast.\n\nIn viii. 26, 8, the A\u1e63vins are invoked along with Indra, with whom they are also connected in x. 73, 4, and on whose car they sometimes ride, while at other times they accompany V\u0101yu, or the \u0100dityas, or the Ribhus, or participate in the strides of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (viii. 9. 12). In i. 182, 2, they are said to possess strongly the qualities of Indra and of the Maruts. In x. 131, 4, 5, they are described as assisting Indra in his conflict with the Asura Namuchi (see my paper \"Contributions,\" etc., p. 94, note), and as vigorous slayers of V\u1e5bttra or of enemies (viii. 8, 22). They are greeted with affection (?) by the other gods when they arrive, x. 24, 5. In A.V. xii. 1, 10, they are represented as having meted out the earth.\n\nThe A\u1e63vins are supplicated with uplifted hands (vi. 63, 3,) for a variety of blessings, for long life, and forgiveness of sin (i. 157, 4); for offspring, wealth, victory, destruction of enemies, protection of friends, preservation of the worshippers themselves, of their houses and cattle (vii. 67, 6; viii. 8, 13, 15, 17; viii. 9, 11, 13; viii. 26, 7). They are exhorted to\n\n\u00b9 Lectures on language, second series, p. 512.\npass by and to destroy the man who offers no oblations, and to create light for the wise man who praises them (i. 182, 3).\n\nNo calamity or alarm from any quarter can touch the man whose chariot they place in the van (x. 39, 11).\u00b9 The Rishi addresses them as a son his parents (vii. 67. 1). In x. 39, 6, a female suppliant, who represents herself as friendless and destitute, calls on them to treat her as parents do their children, and rescue her from her misfortunes. In another place (viii. 62, 11) they are reproached with being as tardy as two old men to respond to the summons of their worshipper. In vii. 72, 2, the Rishi represents himself as having hereditary claims on their consideration, and a common bond of union.\u00b2\n\nThe \u0100swins are described as being, like the other gods, fond of the soma juice (iii. 58, 7, 9; iv. 45, 1, 3; viii. 8, 5; viii. 35, 7-9).\n\nThe following version of the legend relating to the cure of Chyavana by the \u0100swins (to which allusion is made in the passages of the R. V. quoted above) is found in the Satapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, iv. 1, 5, 1 ff.:\n\n\"Chyavana of the race of Bharu, or Chyavana of the race of Angiras, having magically assumed a shrivelled form, was abandoned. \u015aarv\u0101ta, the descendant of Manu, wandered over this [world] with his tribe. He sat down in the neighbourhood [of Chyavana]. His youths, while playing, fancied this shrivelled magical body to be worthless, and pounded it with clods. Chyavana was incensed at the sons of \u015aarv\u0101ta. He created discord among them, so that father fought with son, and brother with brother. \u015aarv\u0101ta bethought him, 'what have I done? in consequence of which this calamity has befallen us.' He ordered the cowherds and shepherds to be called, and said, 'which of you has seen anything here to-day?' They replied, 'this shrivelled magical body which lies there is a man. Fancying it was something worthless,\n\n\u00b9 Compare the request preferred to Indra to bring forward the chariot of his worshipper from the rear to the front (viii. 69, 4. f.)\n\u00b2 The commentator explains this of a common ancestry by saying, in accordance with later tradition, that Vivasvat and Varuna were both sons of Kasyapa and Aditi, and that Vivasvat was the father of the \u0100swins, while Varuna was father of Vasistha the Rishi of the hymn. See Sanskrit Texts, i. 76, f.\nthe youths pounded it with clods.' \u015a\u0101ry\u0101\u1e6da knew then that it was Chyavana. He yoked his chariot, and taking his daughter Sukany\u0101, drove off, and arrived at the place where the Rishi was. He said, 'Reverence to thee, Rishi; I injured thee because I did not know. This is Sukany\u0101, with her I appease thee. Let my tribe be reconciled.' His tribe was in consequence reconciled; and \u015a\u0101ry\u0101\u1e6da of the race of Manu strove that he might never again do injury to any one. Now the \u0100\u015bvins used to wander over this world, performing cures. They approached Sukany\u0101 and wished to seduce her; but she would not consent. They said to her 'Sukany\u0101, what shrivelled magical body is this by which thou liest? follow us.' She replied, 'I will not abandon, while he lives, the man to whom my father gave me.' The Rishi became aware of this. He said, 'Sukany\u0101, what was this that they said to thee?' She told it to him. When informed, he said, 'If they address thee thus again, say to them, 'ye are neither complete nor perfect, and yet ye speak contemptuously of my husband;' and if they ask 'in what respect are we incomplete and imperfect?' then reply, 'make my husband young again, and I will tell you.' Accordingly they came again to her, and said the same thing. She answered, 'Ye are neither complete nor perfect, and yet ye talk contemptuously of my husband.' They enquired, 'In what respect are we incomplete and imperfect?' She rejoined, 'make my husband young again, and I will tell you.' They replied, 'take him to this pond, and he shall come forth with any age which he shall desire.' She took him to the pond, and he came forth with the age that he desired. The \u0100\u015bvins then asked, 'Sukany\u0101, in what respect are we incomplete and imperfect?' To this the Rishi replied, 'The other gods celebrate a sacrifice in Kurukshetra, and exclude you two from it. That is the respect in which ye are incomplete and imperfect.' The \u0100\u015bvins then departed and came to the gods who were celebrating a sacrifice, when the Bahishpavam\u0101\u1e47a\u00b9 text had been recited. They said, 'Invite us to join you.' The gods replied, 'We will not invite you, for ye have wandered about very\n\n\u00b9 See Haug's Ait. Br. ii. p. 120, note 18.\nfamiliarly among men, performing cures.' The \u0100\u015bvins rejoined, 'Ye worship with a headless sacrifice.' They asked, 'How [do we worship] with a headless [sacrifice]? ' The \u0100\u015bvins answered, 'Invite us to join you, and we will tell you.' The gods consented, and invited them. They offered this \u0100\u015bvina draught (graha) to the \u0100\u015bvins, who became the two adhvaryu priests of the sacrifice, and restored the head of the sacrifice. It is related in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a of the Div\u0101kirttyas, in what manner they restored the head of the sacrifice,\" etc., etc.\n\nA story, varying in some particulars, is narrated in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, Vanaparva, 10316 ff. We are there told that the body of Chyavana, when performing austerity in a certain place, became encrusted with an ant-hill; that king \u015a\u0101ry\u0101ti came then to the spot with his wives and his daughter Sukany\u0101; that the Rishi seeing her, became enamoured of her and endeavoured to gain her affections, but without eliciting from her any reply. Seeing, however, the sage's eyes gleaming out from the ant-hill, and not knowing what they were, the princess pierced them with a sharp instrument, whereupon Chyavana became incensed, and afflicted the king's army with a stoppage of urine and of the other necessary function. When the king found out the cause of the infliction, and supplicated the Rishi for its removal, the latter insisted on receiving the king's daughter to wife, as the sole condition of his forgiveness. Sukany\u0101 accordingly lived with the Rishi as his spouse. One day, however, she was seen by the \u0100\u015bvins, who endeavoured, but without effect, to persuade her to desert her decrepit husband, and choose one of them in his place. They then told her they were the physicians of the gods, and would restore her husband to youth and beauty, when she could make her choice between him and one of them. Chyavana and his wife consented to this; and\n\n1 In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, S\u0101ntip. v. 7589 f. it is said that the \u0100\u015bvins are the S\u016bdras of the gods, the Angirasas being the Brahmans, the \u0100dityas the Kshatriyas, and the Maruts the Vaisyas. With the objection made against the \u0100\u015bvins of too great familiarity with mortals, compare the numerous instances of help rendered to their worshippers, which have been quoted above from the R. V., and which may have given rise to this idea.\n\n2 Comp. S. P. Br. viii. 2, 1, 3.\nat the suggestion of the A\u1e63vins he entered with them into the neighbouring pond; when the three came forth of like celestial beauty, and each asked her to be his bride. She however recognized and chose her own husband. Chyavana in gratitude for his restoration to youth, then offered to compel Indra to admit the A\u1e63vins to a participation in the Soma ceremonial, and fulfilled his promise in the course of a sacrifice which he performed for king \u015aary\u0101ti. On that occasion Indra objected to such an honour being extended to the A\u1e63vins, on the ground that they wandered about among men as physicians, changing their forms at will; but Chyavana refused to listen to the objection and carried out his intention, staying the arm of Indra when he was about to launch a thunderbolt, and creating a terrific demon who was on the point of devouring the king of the gods, and was only prevented by the timely submission of the latter.\\footnote{See the similar account of Chyavana's power in the passage from the Anu\u1e63\u0101sana parva quoted in Sanskrit Texts, i. 167 f.}\n\nI have been favoured by Professor Goldst\u00fccker with the following note on the A\u1e63vins:\n\nThe myth of the A\u1e63vins is, in my opinion, one of that class of myths in which two distinct elements, the cosmical and the human or historical, have gradually become blended into one. It seems necessary, therefore, to separate these two elements in order to arrive at an understanding of the myth. The historical or human element in it, I believe, is represented by those legends which refer to the wonderful cures effected by the A\u1e63vins, and to their performances of a kindred sort; the cosmical element is that relating to their luminous nature. The link which connects both seems to be the mysteriousness of the nature and effects of the phenomena of light, and of the healing art at a remote antiquity. That there might have been some horsemen or warriors of great renown who inspired their contemporaries with awe by their wonderful deeds, and more especially by their medical skill, appears to have been also the opinion of some old commentators mentioned by Y\u0101ska, for some \"legendary writer,\" he says, took\nthem for \"two kings, performers of holy acts;\" and this view seems likewise borne out by the legend in which it is narrated that the gods refused the A\u1e63vins admittance to a sacrifice on the ground that they had been on too familiar terms with men. It would appear then that these A\u1e63vins, like the Rbhus, were originally renowned mortals, who in the course of time were translated into the companionship of the gods; and it may be a matter of importance to investigate whether, besides this *a priori* view, there are further grounds of a linguistic or grammatical character, for assuming that the hymns containing the legends relating to these human A\u1e63vins are posterior or otherwise to those descriptive of the cosmical gods of the same name.\n\nThe luminous character of the latter can scarcely be matter of doubt, for the view of some commentators\u2014recorded by Y\u0101ska,\u2014according to which they were identified with \"heaven and earth,\" appears not to be countenanced by any of the passages known to us. Their very name, it would seem, settles this point, since *a\u015bva*, the horse, lit. \"the per-vader,\" is always the symbol of the luminous deities, especially of the sun. The difficulty, however, is to determine their position amongst these deities and to harmonise with it the other myths connected with them. I may here, however, first observe that though Y\u0101ska records opinions which identify the A\u1e63vins with \"day and night,\" and \"sun and moon,\" the passage relied upon by Professor Roth to prove that Y\u0101ska himself identified them with Indra and \u0100ditya (the sun), does not bear out any such conclusion. For the passage in question, as I understand it, means: \"their time is after the (latter) half of the night when the (space's) becoming light is resisted (by darkness); for the middlemost A\u1e63win (between darkness and light) shares in darkness, whilst (the other), who is of a solar nature (\u0101ditya), shares in light.\" There is this verse relating to them: \"In nights,\" etc. Nor does Durga, the commentator on Y\u0101ska, attribute to the latter\n\n---\n\n1 Nir. xii. 1. tayoh k\u0101la\u1e25 \u016brdhvam ardhar\u0101tr\u0101t pr\u0101k\u0101\u015bibh\u0101vasy\u0101nuvishtambham anu (the last word is omitted in Durga MS. I. O. L., No. 206) tamobh\u0101go hi madhyamo jyotirbh\u0101ga \u0101dityah; tayor e\u1e63\u0101 bhavati Vas\u0101tishu sma, etc.\nthe view which Professor Roth ascribes to him. His words, as I interpret them, are: \"'their time is after the (latter) half of the night when the (space's) becoming light is resisted,' (means) when, after the (latter) half of the night darkness intersected by light makes an effort against light, that is the time of the A\u1e63vins. . . . Then the nature of the middlemost (between them) is a share in that darkness which penetrates into light; and the solar one (\u0101ditya) assumes that nature which is a share in the light penetrating into darkness. These two are the middlemost and the uppermost: this is the teacher's (i.e. Y\u0101ska's) own opinion, for in order to substantiate it he gives as an instance the verse 'Vas\u0101tishu sma,'\"1 etc.\n\nTo judge, therefore, from these words, it is the opinion of Y\u0101ska that the A\u1e63vins represent the transition from darkness to light when the intermingling of both produces that inseparable duality expressed by the twin nature of these deities. And this interpretation, I hold, is the best that can be given of the character of the cosmical A\u1e63vins. It agrees with the epithets by which they are invoked and with the relationship in which they are placed. They are young, yet also ancient, beautiful, bright, swift, etc.; and their negative character\u2014the result of the alliance of light with darkness\u2014is, I believe, expressed by dasra, the destroyer, and also by the two negatives in the compound n\u0101satya (na + a-satya), though their positive character is again redeemed by the ellipsis of \"enemies, or diseases,\" to dasra, and by the sense of n\u0101satya, not-untrue, i.e. truthful.

Professor Roth, in his illustrations of Nir. xii. 1, very correctly observes that the verse quoted by Y\u0101ska, (vas\u0101tishu sma, etc.) does not bear out the view that the A\u1e63vins are Indra and \u0100ditya; but the proper inference to be drawn from this circumstance would seem to be, not that Y\u0101ska quoted a verse irrelevant to his view, but that Prof. Roth attributed to him a view which he had not entertained, and that it may be preferable to render \u0101ditya as proposed above: \"the solar (A\u1e63vin)\" or the A\u1e63vin of a solar nature.\nTHE VEDIC THEOGONY AND MYTHOLOGY.\n\nsun; for they precede the rise of the sun; they are the sons of the sky, and again the sons of Vivasvat and Saranyu. Vivasvat, I believe, here implies the firmament \"expanding\" to the sight through the approaching light; and though Saranyu is to Professor M\u00fcller one of the deities which are forced by him to support his dawn-theory, it seems to me that the etymology of the word, and the character of the myths relating to it, rather point to the moving air, or the dark and cool air, heated and therefore set in motion by the approach of the rising sun. The A\u1e63vins are also the husbands or the friends of S\u016bry\u0101, whom I take for the representative of the weakest manifestation of the sun; and I believe that \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a is right when by the sister of the A\u1e63vins he understands Ushas, the dawn. The mysterious phenomenon of the intermingling of darkness\u2014which is no longer complete night\u2014and of light\u2014which is not yet dawn\u2014seems to agree with all these conceptions, and with the further details of a cosmical nature, which are so fully given in the preceding paper.\n\nNOTICE OF SOME OF THE GODDESSES IN THE VEDIC HYMNS.\n\nOf the goddesses mentioned in the Rig Veda some have been noticed already in this or preceding papers, viz., Aditi, the mother of the \u0100dityas, and representative of the universe; Diti, her counterpart; Nishtigri, the mother, and Indr\u0101\u1e47i, the wife of Indra;1 Pri\u1e63ni, the mother of the Maruts; and S\u016bry\u0101, the daughter of the Sun, and spouse of the A\u1e63vins, or of Soma. Various other goddesses are also celebrated in the hymns of the Rig Veda, such as Agn\u0101y\u012b, Varun\u0101\u1e47\u012b, Rodasi, R\u0101k\u1e63a, Siniv\u0101lti, \u015araddh\u0101 (Faith), and the Apsarases, whose names, however, occur but rarely; and Ushas, and Sarasvat\u012b,\n\n---\n\n1 Indr\u0101\u1e47i says in R.V. x. 86, 9: \"This mischievous creature treats me with disdain as if I had no husband or sons, and yet I am the wife of Indra, and the mother of a hero,\" etc.; and in v. 11, it is said: \"I have heard of Indr\u0101\u1e47i as the most fortunate of all these females, for never at any future time shall her husband die from decay.\" Indr\u0101\u1e47i is mentioned in the Taitt. Br. ii. 4, 2, 7, from which it appears that different goddesses had been competitors for the hand of Indra, and that Indr\u0101\u1e47i has been chosen because she surpassed them all in voluptuous attractions. In the same work, ii. 8, 8, 4, V\u0101ch is said to be the wife of Indra.\nwith her cognates, who receive considerably greater prominence.\n\nSarasvat\u012b.\n\nSarasvat\u012b is a goddess of some, though not of very great, importance in the Rig Veda. As observed by Y\u0101ska (Nirukta ii. 23) she is celebrated both as a river and as a deity.\u00b9 As an instance of the former character, he refers to R. V. vi. 61, 2, which I shall quote further on. She was no doubt primarily a river deity, as her name, \u201cthe watery,\u201d\u00b2 clearly denotes, and in this capacity she is celebrated in a few separate passages. Allusion is made in the hymns, as well as in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as (Ait. Br. ii. 19; Haug, vol. ii. p. 112) to sacrifices being performed on the banks of this river and of the adjoining Dr\u012bshadvat\u012b;\u00b3 and the Sarasvat\u012b in particular seems to have been associated with the reputation for sanctity, which, according to the well-known passage in the Institutes of Manu (ii. 17 f.) was ascribed to the whole region, called Brahmapurta, lying between these two small streams, and situated immediately to the westward of the Jumna. The Sarasvat\u012b thus appears to have been to the early Indians what the Ganges (which is only twice named in the Rig Veda) became to their descendants.\u2074 Already in R.V. i. 3, 10 (where, however, she is perhaps regarded as the goddess of sacrifice) she is described as \u201cthe purifier;\u201d and in R.V. x. 17, 10 (=V\u0101j. San. 4, 2; A.V. vi. 51, 2), (after Sarasvat\u012b has been mentioned, vv. 7-9), the waters are thus celebrated: \u201cMay the Waters, the mothers, cleanse us, may they (the waters) who purify with butter,\n\n\u00b9 See also S\u0101ya\u1e47a on R. V. i. 3, 12: Dvividh\u0101 hi Sarasvat\u012b vigrahavod-devat\u0101 med\u012b-r\u016bp\u0101 cha.\n\u00b2 Sarasvat\u012b sara \u012bty udk\u0101-n\u0101ma sartes tad-vat\u012b (Nir. ix. 26). The Brahmapurta-purana, ii. 6, as referred to in Prof. Aufrecht's Cat. p. 23, col. 2, has a legend that the Sarasvat\u012b was changed into a river by an imprecation of the Gang\u0101. In the A.V. vi. 100, 1, three Sarasvat\u012bs are spoken of, but no explanation is given of their difference.\n\u00b3 R.V. iii. 23, 4: \u201cI place thee, Agni, on the abode of Il\u0101 (comp. iii. 29, 4), on the most excellent spot of the earth, on the most auspicious of days. Shine, so as to enrich us, in a place of human resort, on the banks of the Dr\u012bshadvat\u012b, the \u0100pay\u0101, the Sarasvat\u012b.\u201d\n\u2074 It is clear from the passages quoted in Sanskrit Texts, ii. 415 ff. that the Sarasvat\u012b continued in later times also to be regarded as a sacred river, but this character was shared by other Indian streams, if not by them all.\npurify us with butter; for these goddesses bear away sin; I come up out of them pure and cleansed.\u201d When once the river had acquired a divine character, it was quite natural that she should be regarded as the patroness of the ceremonies which were celebrated on the margin of her holy waters, and that her direction and blessing should be invoked as essential to their proper performance and success. The connection into which she was thus brought with sacred rites seems to have led to the further step of imagining her to have an influence on the composition of the hymns which formed so important a part of the proceedings, and of identifying her with V\u0101ch, the goddess of speech. At least, I have no other explanation to offer of this identification.\n\nSarasvat\u012b is frequently invited to the sacrifices along with several other goddesses, Il\u0101, Bh\u0101rati, Mah\u0101, Hotr\u0101, Varu\u1e47\u0101, Dhishan\u0101 (i. 13, 9; i. 142, 9; i. 188, 8; iii. 4, 8; v. 5, 8; v. 42, 12; ix. 5, 8; x. 110, 8), who, however, were never, like her, river nymphs, but personifications of some department of religious worship, or sacred science. She is also frequently invoked along with other deities (ii. 30, 8; iii. 54, 13; vii. 35, 11; viii. 38, 10; ix. 81, 4; x. 65, 1, 13; x. 141, 5).\n\nIn many of the passages where Sarasvat\u012b is celebrated, her original character is, as I have intimated, distinctly preserved. Thus in vi. 52, 6; x. 30, 12, she is mentioned along with rivers, or fertilizing waters; and in x. 64, 9; x. 75, 5, she is specified along with the other well-known streams which are there named. In vii. 96, 2, and viii. 21, 18, reference is made to the kings and people living along her banks. In vi. 61, 10, and vii. 36, 6, she is spoken of as having seven sisters, as one of seven rivers, and as the mother of streams. In vii. 95, 1 and 2, she is said to pour on her fertilizing\n\n---\n\n1 S\u0101yana understands i. 3, 12, of the river, and explains it thus: \u201cThe Sarasvat\u012b by her act (of flowing) displays a copious flood.\u201d Roth in his Illustrations of the Nirukta (xi. 26) p. 162, translates, \u201cA mighty stream is Sarasvat\u012b; with her light she lightens, illuminates all pious minds.\u201d Ifc, however, regards the commencing words as figurative, and not as referring to the river. Benfey renders: \u201cSarasvat\u012b by her light causes the great sea to be known: she shines through all thoughts.\u201d He understands the \u201cgreat sea\u201d as the universe, or as life, which he says is often designated in common Sanskrit also by the word sa\u1e45kara. Benfey\u2019s explanation seems to me to be unsuitable. The conceptions of Sarasvat\u012b as a river and as the directress of ceremonies may be blended in the passage.\nwaters, and to surpass all other rivers, to flow pure from the mountains to the sea, to be the swiftest of floods (apas\u0101m apastam\u0101 (vi. 61, 13); and in vi. 61, 2 and 8, to tear away the bases of the mountains on her banks with her impetuous and resounding current. In ii. 41, 16, she is called the best of mothers, of rivers, and of goddesses (ambitame, naditame, devitame).\n\nIn vii. 96, 4-6, a river god called Sarasvat is assigned as a consort to Sarasvat\u012b, who rolls along his fertilizing waters, and is invoked by the worshippers as the bestower of wives and offspring, as well as of plenty and protection.\n\nIn v. 43, 11, Sarasvat\u012b is called upon to descend from the sky, from the great mountain,\u00b9 to the sacrifice; and in vi. 49, 7, where she is called the daughter of the lightning (p\u0101viravi kany\u0101)\u00b2 and the wife of a hero (vira-patni),\u00b3 she is supplicated to combine with the spouses of the gods to afford secure protection to the worshipper. In the first of these two passages the poet may perhaps be considered as assigning a celestial origin to the river as the offspring of thunder and rain.\n\nIn vi. 61, 11 f. she is said to fill the terrestrial regions and the air, and to occupy three abodes (trisadashth\u0101), and to have seven parts or elements (sapta-dh\u0101tuh).\n\nWhen regarded as a river nymph, Sarasvat\u012b is further described as an iron barrier or fortress, and a support (vii. 95, 1), as bestowing wealth, fatness, and fertility (vii. 95, 2), and is besought to listen to the prayer of her worshippers at their sacrifices (ibid. 4), to receive their praises, to shelter and protect them like a tree (ibid. 5), and to grant reputation to the unrenowned (ii. 41, 16). In vi. 61, 14, the rishi prays that he may not be removed to regions which are strange to her.\n\nIn vi. 61, 1, she is represented as having given to Vadhryasva a son Divod\u0101sa, a canceller of his debts.\n\nViewed as the patroness of holy rites, (though it is\n\n\u00b9 S\u0101ya\u1e47a says that Madhyamik\u0101 V\u0101ch, or the goddess V\u0101ch, who resides in the region intermediate between heaven and earth, is here intended.\n\u00b2 See Roth s. v. and compare x. 65, 13. Prof. M\u00fcller, in Kuhn and Schleicher's Beitr\u00e4ge, etc., iii. 448, assigns to p\u0101viravi the sense of \"thundering.\"\n\u00b3 S\u0101ya\u1e47a says her husband is Praj\u0101pati. Would it not rather be Sarasvat?\nnot always easy to separate the one from the other of her characters), Sarasvat\u012b is described as coming to the place of sacrifice in the same chariot with the oblations and the forefathers (x. 17, 8), as unctuous with butter, and as stimulating, directing, and prospering the devotions of the worshippers (i. 3, 10, 11; ii. 3, 8; vi. 61, 4). She affords secure protection, conquers enemies (ii. 30, 8; vi. 49, 7), and destroys the revilers of the gods (vi. 61, 3). She is dreadful, moves along a golden path,\\(^1\\) and is a destroyer of Vrittra (vi. 61, 7). She yields prosperity and riches of all description from her prolific breasts\\(^2\\) (i. 89, 3; i. 164, 49; viii. 21, 17; x. 17, 8, 9; ix. 67, 32), is the receptacle of all the powers of life (\\textit{visv\u0101 \u0101y\u016bnshi}), and bestows offspring (ii. 41, 17). In x. 184, 2, she is associated with the deities who assist procreation. In ii. 1, 11, Agni is identified with her, and several other goddesses.\n\nIn R. V. x. 131, 5 (= V\u0101j. S. x. 34) where the \u0100\u015bvins are said to have defended Indra, Sarasvat\u012b also is declared to have waited upon him. And in V\u0101j. S. xix. 12, it is said, \u201cThe gods celebrated a healing sacrifice, the \u0100\u015bvins physicians, and Sarasvat\u012b too a physician through speech, communicated vigour to Indra.\u201d The \u0100\u015bvins and Sarasvat\u012b are also connected with each other in V\u0101j. S. xix. 12, 15, 18, 34, 80-83, 88-90, 93-95; xx. 56-69, 73-76, 90. In xix. 94, it is said that \u201cSarasvat\u012b, wife of the \u0100\u015bvins, holds a well-formed embryo in her womb. Varu\u1e47a, king in the waters, produced Indra for glory, by the aqueous fluid as if by a s\u0101ma verse.\u201d\n\nIt does not appear that in the R.V. Sarasvat\u012b is identified with V\u0101ch. For the passages of that collection in which the latter goddess is celebrated, I refer to Sanskrit texts, iii. 151-156; and to my former paper on \u201cThe progress of the Vedic Religion, etc.,\u201d pp. 354 f. (note) and p. 377.\n\n\\(^1\\) \\textit{Hiranyavarttini\u1e25}. \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a explains \\textit{varlttini} as chariot, and the compound as meaning \u201chaving a golden chariot.\u201d The same word occurs again, applied to a river, in viii. 26, 18, where \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a makes it mean \u201chaving a golden path,\u201d i.e. golden banks. The words \\textit{rudra-varlttini}, \u201cwhose path is dreadful,\u201d and \\textit{gh\u1e5bta-varlttini}, \u201cwhose path is unctuous,\u201d are also applied to different deities in the Rig Veda. \\textit{Kr\u1e63\u1e47a-varlttini}, \u201che whose path is marked by blackness,\u201d is an epithet of Agni in viii. 23, 19, and the sense of that term is fixed by the use of the synonym \\textit{kr\u1e63\u1e47addhean}. The substantive \\textit{varlttini} occurs in vii. 18, 16.\n\n\\(^2\\) Compare Ait. Br. iv. 1, at the end, where her two breasts are said to be truth and falsehood.\nIn the later mythology, as is well known, Sarasvat\u012b was identified with V\u0101ch, and became under different names the spouse of Brahm\u0101, and the goddess of wisdom and eloquence, and is invoked as a Muse. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata she is called the mother of the Vedas (\u015a\u0101ntiparva v. 12920), and the same is said of V\u0101ch in the Taittir\u012bya Br. ii. 8, 8, 5,\u00b9 where (and in the preceding par. 4,) she is also said to be the wife of Indra, to contain within herself all worlds, and to have been sought after by the rishis who composed the Vedic hymns (rishayo mantra-kritah), as well as by the gods, through austerity.\n\nIn the \u015a\u0101ntiparva v. 6811, it is related that when the Brahmarshis were performing austerities prior to the creation of the universe, \u201ca voice derived from Brahm\u0101 entered into the ears of them all; the celestial Sarasvat\u012b was then produced from the heavens.\u201d\u00b2\n\nExcepting Aditi and Ushas the other goddesses mentioned in the Rig Veda are, as I have already intimated, of very little importance. Agn\u00e2y\u0101, Varu\u1e47\u0101n\u012b, A\u015bvini, and Rodas\u012b, the wives of Agni, Varuna, the Asvins, and Rudra respectively (Nirukta ix. 33 f.; xi. 50; xii. 46) are only alluded to in a few passages, i. 22, 12; ii. 32, 8; v. 46, 8; vi. 50, 5; vi. 66, 6; vii. 34, 22. No distinct functions are assigned to them, and they do not occupy positions at all corresponding to the rank of their husbands, with whom in fact they are never associated. The insignificance of these goddesses forms a striking contrast to the prominent position assumed by the spouses of \u015aiva and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, especially the former, in the later mythology.\n\n**Aranyak\u0101.**\n\nAranyak\u0101 (Nir. ix. 29, 30), is the goddess of forest solitude.\n\n\u00b9 In the S. P. Br. vii. 5, 2, 52, it is said, \u201cMind is the ocean. From mind, the ocean, the gods, with V\u0101ch for a shovel, dug out the triple science (i.e. the three Vedas). Wherefore this verse (sloka) has been uttered,\u201d etc. In the Bh\u0101sma-p. of the M. Bh. v. 3019, Achyuta (Krishna) is said to have created Sarasvat\u012b and the Vedas from his mind. In the Vana-p. v. 13432, the G\u0101yatr\u012b is called the mother of the Vedas.\n\n\u00b2 Compare the verse quoted by \u015aankara on the Brahma s\u016btras (see Sanskrit Texts, iii. 68), from a Sm\u1e5bti: \u201cIn the beginning a celestial voice, formed of the Vedas, eternal, without beginning or end, was uttered by Svayambh\u016b, from which all activities have proceeded.\u201d\nShe is celebrated in R. V. x. 146, which I have translated in a preceding paper.\n\n**R\u0101k\u0101, Sin\u012bv\u0101l\u012b, and Gung\u016b.**\n\nR\u0101k\u0101, Sin\u012bv\u0101l\u012b, and Gung\u016b (whom S\u0101ya\u1e47a on ii. 32, 8, identifies with Kuh\u016b) are three other goddesses mentioned in the R. V. (the first in ii. 32, 4, 5, 8; v. 42, 12; the second in ii. 32, 6 ff.; x. 184, 2; and the third in ii. 32, 8). S\u0101ya\u1e47a (on ii. 32, 4) says that R\u0101k\u0101 is the full moon. She is, however, closely connected with parturition, as she is asked to \"sew the work (apparently the formation of the embryo) with an unfailing needle,\" and to bestow a son with abundant wealth\" (ii. 34, 4). Sin\u012bv\u0101l\u012b and Kuh\u016b are (as we are told by Y\u0101ska, xi. 31), wives of the gods according to the mythologists (nairukt\u0101k), and the two new moons (am\u0101v\u0101sy\u0113) according to the ritualists (y\u0101jnik\u0101k), Sin\u012bv\u0101l\u012b being the earlier and Kuh\u016b the later. Sin\u012bv\u0101l\u012b is, however, also connected with parturition, being called the broad-loined (or bushy-haired), the prolific, the handsome-armed, the handsome-fingered, supplicated for progeny (ii. 32, 6, 7), and asked to bestow pregnancy (x. 184, 2; A. V. v. 25, 3; vi. 11, 3). Y\u0101ska quotes from the Taitt. Br. iii. 3, 11, a verse regarding Kuh\u016b, whose name does not occur in the Rig Veda.\n\n**\u015araddh\u0101.**\n\nPersonifications of abstract ideas are not unknown in the Rig Veda, one hymn of which (x. 151) is addressed to \u015araddh\u0101, or religious faith. By her, it is said, v. 1 (= Nir. ix. 31), \"the (sacrificial) fire is kindled, and by her the oblation is offered up.\" She is asked to prosper the liberal worshippers of the gods (v.v. 2, 3), and to impart faith; and is said to be an object of adoration in the morning, at noon, and at sunset (v. 5).\n\n---\n\n1 On these goddesses see Weber's Ind. Stud. v. 228 ff. and 237.\n2 In the V\u0101j. Sanhit\u0101, xix. 30, it is said that faith (praddh\u0101) is obtained by gifts (dak\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101) and truth (satya) by faith. In xix. 77 of the same work it is declared that \"Praj\u0101pati beholding, made a distinction between the forms of truth and falsehood (saty\u0101\u1e41rte), connecting disbelief (apradh\u0101) with the latter, and faith or belief (praddh\u0101) with the former.\" This declaration, that truth is the only proper object of faith, has a far deeper signification than this ancient writer could possibly have assigned to it, viz., that it is the ultimate truth, and not the so-called orthodoxy of any proposition, which can alone entitle it to reception.\nSraddh\u0101 is also celebrated in the Taitt. Br. ii. 8, 8, 6 f., where the above hymn of the R. V. is repeated; and she is there further said to dwell among the gods, to be the universe, and the mother of K\u0101ma. (See my paper on the \"Progress of the Vedic Religion,\" p. 377, note). In the same Taitt. Br. iii. 12, 3, 1, we are told that through Sraddh\u0101 a god obtains his divine character, that the divine Sraddh\u0101 is the support of the world, that she has K\u0101ma (or the fulfilment of desire) for her calf, and yields immortality as her milk; that she is the first-born of the religious ceremonial, and the sustainer of the whole world: and she, who is the supreme mistress of the world, is besought to bestow immortality on her worshippers. In the S. P. Br. (xii. 7, 3, 11) she is called the daughter of S\u016brya;\u00b9 an appellation which is repeated in the M. Bh. \u015a\u0101ntiparva, v. 9449,\u00b2 where she is styled Sraddh\u0101 Vaivasvati, as well as S\u016bryasya duhit\u0101 and S\u0101vitri.\n\nLakshm\u012b and \u015ar\u012b.\n\nLakshm\u012b is not found in the R. V. in the sense which the word bears in the later mythology, of a goddess personifying good fortune, though the word itself occurs in x. 71, 2,\u00b3 in another signification. In the A. V., however, we have the following hymn which speaks of a plurality of Lakshmis, some good and some bad: vii. 115, 1: \"Fly away hence, o unlucky (or miserable) Lakshm\u012b (p\u0101pi lakshmi), perish hence, fly away from thence: with an iron hook we fasten thee to our enemy. 2. Savitri, do thou who art golden-handed, be-\n\n\u00b9 See what is said of the daughter of S\u016brya above, in connection with the \u0100\u015bvins.\n\u00b2 In this passage a great deal is said in praise of Sraddh\u0101. She smites the man who smites her. The gods, it appears, had decided that the offerings of a niggardly student of the Veda (pratirya) and a liberal learner were of equal value. But Praj\u0101pati determined that they were wrong (see the same sentiment in nearly the same words in Manu, iv. 224 ff.), and that the liberal man's oblation, being purified by his faith (graddh\u0101), was to be accepted, whilst the other man's, being vitiated by his unbelief, was to be rejected. Unbelief, it is added, is the greatest of sins, but faith takes away sin.\n\u00b3 A similar sentiment is expressed in the Vana-parva, 13461 ff.: \"The doubter enjoys neither this world nor the next, nor any gratification. Those ancient sages who possess true knowledge have said that faith (pratyaya) is a sign of final liberation. . . Abandoning fruitless (lit. dry) argumentations (pushka-tarkam), adhere to the gruti and the sm\u1e5bti\" (the Vedas and other books dependent on them).\n\u2074 In the words bhadr\u0101 e\u1e63\u0101m lakshmi nihi\u1e6d\u0101 adhi v\u0101chi, \"an auspicious fortune is attached to their words.\"\nstowing on us wealth, send away from us to some other quarter the flying and inauspicious Lakshmi who mounts up on me, as a creeper\\(^1\\) upon a tree. 3. A hundred Lakshmis are born together with the body of a mortal at his birth. Of these we chase away hence the most unlucky. Do thou, J\u0101tavedas, retain for us those which are fortunate. 4. Thus I divide them like the cows standing upon barren ground. May those Lakshmis which are auspicious (puny\u0101) rest here. Those which are unlucky (p\u0101pih) I destroy.\u201d (The expression puny\u0101 Lakshmi occurs also in A. V. xii. 5, 6).\n\nIn the V\u0101j. S. xxxi. 22, \u015ar\u012b and Lakshmi are said to be the two wives (of \u0100ditya, according to the commentator). In the \u015a. P. Br. xi. 4, 3, 1, \u015ar\u012b is described as issuing forth from Praj\u0101pati when he was performing intense austerity. Beholding her then standing resplendent and trembling,\\(^2\\) the gods were covetous of her and proposed to Praj\u0101pati that they should be allowed to kill her, and appropriate her gifts. He replied that she was a female, and that males did not generally kill females. They should therefore take from her her gifts without depriving her of life. In consequence, Agni, took from her food; Soma, kingly authority; Varuna, imperial authority; Mitra, martial energy (kshattra); Indra, force; Brihaspati, priestly glory (brahma-varchasa); Savitri, dominion; P\u016bshan, splendour; Sarasvat\u012b, nourishment, and Tvashtri, forms. \u015ar\u012b then complained to Praj\u0101pati that they had taken all these things from her. He told her to demand them back from them by sacrifice. This she accordingly did, and succeeded.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Vand\u0101nta. This word does not occur in Wilson's Dictionary, but I find there vand\u0101 in the sense of a creeping plant.\n\n\\(^2\\) L\u0101l\u0101yanti. As fixing the sense of this word Prof. Aufrecht refers me to \u015a. P. Br. p. 136; Brhad \u0101ranyak\u0101 p. 737; Mundaka Up. pp. 274, 276; and \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Up. p. 332.\nART. II.\u2014Miscellaneous hymns from the Rig and Atharva Vedas.\u00b9 By J. Muir, Esq., D.C.L., LL.D.\n\nThe hymns of the Rig Veda are, as is well known, almost entirely of a religious character, designed, or at least, adapted, for recitation at the worship of the various popular deities, or at some of the ceremonials connected with various important events in the domestic or public life of the ancient Indians. Among these, however, are interspersed a few of a different description, which, from the wide celebrity they had acquired, were carefully preserved by the descendants of their authors, or by other interested persons, and have been incorporated in the great collection of sacred songs. Some of these productions, like the colloquy of Yama and Yam\u00ee (translated in a former paper), the very obscure conversation between the hero Pur\u00fbravas and the Apsaras Urv\u00e2si (R. V. x. 95),\u00b2 and the Vrish\u00e2kapi hymn (R. V. x. 86), derived their importance from the interlocutors being personages regarded as divine, or ranked among the ancestors of the human race. Others, like the 72nd, the 90th, and the 129th hymns of the 10th Book (also quoted in previous articles) were venerated from the nature of the topics which they handled, or the depth or gravity of the speculations which they contain. Others, again, such as the hymns referred to by Professor Roth in his dissertation \u201con the historical matter contained in the Rig Veda,\u201d\u00b3 would possess an interest for the descendants of\n\n\u00b9 I have again to acknowledge the valuable aid which I have received from Professor Aufrecht in rendering some of the more difficult parts of the hymns translated in this paper.\n\n\u00b2 Professor Max M\u00fcller's Essay on Comparative Mythology, in the Oxford Essays for 1856, contains a translation of this myth as narrated in the \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. The Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, however, only quotes and illustrates the easiest verses of the hymn (R. V. x. 95), making no reference to its most obscure and difficult portions. Some of the verses not cited in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a are explained by Professor M\u00fcller. See also Roth's Illustrations of Nirukta, pp. 153 ff. and 230.\n\n\u00b3 Sur Litteratur und Geschichte des Weda, pp. 87.\nthe contending priestly races to whose rivalries they made allusion, and might even be valued for the purposes of imprecation to which they could be applied.\u00b9 And those compositions which celebrate the liberality of different princes to their domestic priests would naturally be handed down with care by the successors of those favoured individuals.\n\nIn the following paper I shall adduce some other hymns, both from the Rig and the Atharva Vedas, which are only in part of a religious character, and possess a greater general interest than the bulk of those with which they are associated, from the references which they make to human character, dispositions, feelings, passions, and circumstances; from the light which they throw on the progress of sacerdotal pretensions, or from some other feature of their contents. In some of these hymns it will be seen that a considerable amount of shrewdness and worldly wisdom is expressed in a sententious form.\n\n**Hymn to Aranyak\u00ee, R. V. x. 146.**\n\nThe first hymn which I shall adduce, addressed to the goddess of forest solitude, is distinguished by the poetical feeling which pervades it, and the natural manner in which the emotions arising from the situation there described are depicted, though some of the allusions which it contains are difficult to explain or comprehend. It is repeated in the Taittiriya Br\u00e2hma\u1e47a, and explained by the Commentator on that work. (See also Roth\u2019s Illustrations of the Nirukta, p. 132).\n\n1. \u201cAranyak\u00ee, Aranyak\u00ee, thou who seemest to lose thyself there, why dost thou not ask [the way to] the village? Does not terror seize thee (at thy solitude)? 2. When the chichchika (a bird) answers to the roar of bulls when it is uttered, flying about as if with cymbals, then [by their voices] Aranyak\u00ee is lauded [as if by hymns]. 3. And the cows seem to eat, and the house appears to be seen, and at evening Aranyak\u00ee seems to discharge the carts.\u00b2 4. One man calls to his cow,\n\n\u00b9 See Sanskrit Texts, i. 127 ff.\n\u00b2 Professor Aufrecht thinks this clause (pakat\u00eer iva sarjati) should be rendered, \u201cIn the evening the forest moves like a cart,\u201d with reference to the agitation of the branches by the evening air.\nanother fells a tree; a man lingering in the forest (in Aran-y\u0101n\u012b) fancies that she [or some one] has screamed. 5. Aran-y\u0101n\u012b is not [herself] murderous, if no one else (a tiger, etc.) assails; but after eating of sweet fruit, a man rests there at his pleasure. 6. I laud Aranyak\u0101n\u012b, the mother of wild beasts, the unctuous-scented, the fragrant, who yields abundance of food, though she has no hinds to till her.\"\n\nThe next hymn which I shall quote refers to the great variety by which the aims and pursuits of different men are characterized. It is distinguished by a vein of naive observation, not unmingled with satire; and is curious as revealing to us the occupations pursued by the poet's father and mother, though it makes no reference to the class to which they belonged.\n\n**Rig Veda, ix. 112.**\n\n1. \"We different men have all our various imaginations and designs. The carpenter seeks something that is broken, the doctor a patient, the priest some one who will offer libations. O Indu (Soma), flow forth for Indra.\" 2. With dried-up sticks, with birds' feathers, with metals, the artizan continually seeks after a man with plenty of gold. O Indu, etc., etc. 3. (= Nirukta, vi. 6) I am a poet, my father is a doctor, and my mother is a grinder of corn. With our different views, seeking to get gain, we run after [our respective objects] as after cattle.\" O Indu, etc. 4. The draught horse desires an easy-going carriage; merry companions a laugh; the female sex the male; and frogs a pond. O Indu,\" etc.\n\n**Rig Veda, x. 34.**\n\nThe next hymn, which may possibly be the production of one who lays before us the sad results of his own bitter experience, describes with great vividness, graphic power, and truth of observation the seductions and miseries of gambling,\n\n---\n\n1 This last clause, which is repeated at the end of each of the verses, and transforms the hymn into an address to Soma, is perhaps a later addition to an older song; as it seems to have no connection with the other parts of the verses to which it is attached.\n\n2 The three preceding verses are translated by Roth in his Illustrations of the Nirukta, p. 74.\nwhich, we see, were as acutely felt in those early ages as they are in these later times.\n\n1. (= Nirukta ix. 8). \"The tumbling, air-born [products] of the great Vibh\u00eddaka tree (i.e. the dice) delight me as they continue to roll on the dice-board. The exciting dice enchant me like a draught of the soma-plant growing on mount M\u00fajvat. 2. She (the gamester's own wife) never wronged or despised me. She was kind to me, and to my friends. But I for the sake of the partial dice, have spurned my devoted spouse. 3. My mother-in-law detests me; my wife rejects me. In his need [the gamester] finds no comforter. I cannot discover what is the enjoyment of the gambler any more than I can perceive what is the happiness of a worn-out hack horse. 4. Others pay court to the wife of the man whose wealth is coveted by the impetuous dice. His father, mother, brothers, say of him, \"We know nothing of him; take him away bound.\" 5. When I resolve not to be tormented by them, because I am abandoned by my friends who withdraw from me,\u2014yet as soon as the brown dice, when they are thrown, make a rattling sound, I hasten to their rendezvous, like a woman to her paramour.\u00b9 6. The gamester comes to the assembly, glowing in body, and inquiring, \"shall I win?\" The dice inflame his desire, making over his winnings to his opponent. 7. Hooking, piercing, deceitful, vexatious, delighting to torment, the dice dispense transient gifts, and again ruin the winner; they are covered with honey, but destroy the gambler. 8. Their troop of fifty-three disports itself [disposing men's destinies] like the god Savitri whose ordinances never fail. They bow not before the wrath even of the fiercest. The king himself makes obeisance to them. 9. They roll downward; they bound upward. Having no hands, they overcome him who has. These celestial coals, when thrown on the diceboard, scorch the heart, though cold themselves. 10. The destitute wife of the gamester is distressed, and so too is the mother of a son who goes she knows not whither. In debt and seeking after money, the gambler approaches with trepidation the\n\n\u00b9 These words are quoted in Nirukta xii. 7.\nhouses of other people at night. 11. It vexes the gamester to see his own wife, and then to observe the wives and happy homes of others. In the morning he yokes the brown horses (the dice); by the time when the fire goes out he has sunk into a degraded wretch. 12. He who is the general of your band, the first king of your troop,\u2014to him I stretch forth [my] ten [fingers] toward the east [in reverence]:\u00b9 I spare no expense [in my offering]. That I declare with perfect truth. 13. Never play with dice; practice husbandry; rejoice in thy property, esteeming it sufficient. \u2018There, o gamester, are thy cows; [this is] thy wife;\u2019\u2014so the adorable Savitri addresses me. 14. Be friendly [o dice]; be auspicious to us; do not bewitch us powerfully with your enchantment. Let your hostile wrath abate. Let others be subject to the fetters of the brown ones (the dice).\u201d\n\nThat the passion for gambling prevailed very extensively at the time when the hymns of the Rig- and Atharva-vedas were composed is clear, from various other allusions to the practice which we find there. Thus in R. V. vii. 86, dice are mentioned along with wine, anger, thoughtlessness, etc., as causes of sin. The following verses from the A. V. prove the same point:\n\nA. V. vii. 50-1. \u201cAs the lightning every day strikes the tree irresistibly, so may I to-day irresistibly smite the gamester with the dice. 2. May the wealth of the rich and of the poor unresisting be collected from every side into my hand as winnings.\u201d\n\nvii. 109. 1. \u201cThis reverence be paid to the brown [die], who is ruler among the dice. With butter I worship Kali; may he thus be auspicious to us. 2. Bring, o Agni, butter to the Apsarases, but dust, sand, and water to the dice. Seeking oblations according to their several shares, the gods delight in both offerings. 3. The Apsarases hold a festival between the oblation and the sun. May they anoint my hands with butter, and overwhelm the gamester who is my opponent. 4. Dispense bad luck to our adversary, but moisten\n\n\u00b9 Compare A. V. v. 28, 11, and V\u0101jasaneyi Sanh\u012bt\u0101, xvi. 64.\nus with butter. Strike, as lightning does a tree, the man who plays against us.\"\n\nvi. 118, l. \"Whatever sins we have committed with our hands, seeking to obtain the host of dice,\u2014remit to us to-day that debt, ye Apsarases Ugrampasy\u00e2 and Ugrajit.\"\n\nA. V. iv. 38. 1. \"I invoke hither the skilfully-playing Apsaras who cuts up and conquers, and gets gains in the game of dice. 2. I invoke hither the skilfully-playing Apsaras, who collects and scatters, and receives gains in the game of dice. 3. May she who dances about with the dice when she wins by gaming, grant gain to us, and obtain superiority, through her skill. May she come to us with abundance of riches. Let them not conquer our money. 4. I invoke hither the joyful and exulting Apsarases\u2014those [goddesses] who delight in dice, and bring with them grief and anger.\"\n\nIt will be seen from these verses that the Apsarases are intimately connected with gambling. In A.V. ii. 2, 4, they are said to be \"fond of dice,\" and \"soul bewitching.\"\n\nThe next two hymns which I proceed to quote are in praise of generosity. The first of them celebrates liberality to the destitute in general; the second eulogizes the same virtue when exhibited in giving presents to priests.\n\nRig Veda, x. 117.\n\n1. \"The gods have not ordained hunger to be our destruction. Even those who are full-fed are overtaken by various forms of death (lit. deaths). The prosperity of the liberal man never decays; while the illiberal finds no comforter. 2. He who, himself well provided with sustenance, hardens his heart against the poor man who approaches him, starving, and who has long courted him, desirous of food,\u2014such a man meets with none to cheer him. 3. He is the bountiful man who gives to the lean beggar who comes to him craving food. Success attends that man in the sacrifice, and he secures for himself a friend in the future. 4. He is no friend who bestows nothing on his friend who waits upon him, seeking\nfor sustenance. Let every one depart from such a man;\u2014his house is no home,\u2014and look out for some one else who is liberal, even though he be a stranger. 5. Let the powerful man be generous to the suppliant; let him look along the path [of futurity]. For, oh, riches revolve like the wheels of a chariot: they come, now to one, now to another.\\(^1\\) 6. In vain the fool obtains food: I tell the truth; it becomes his destruction (comp. v. 1). He nourishes neither his friend nor his companion. He who keeps his food to himself, has his sin to himself. 7. The ploughshare furrowing the ground, brings men plenty. A man moving onward with his feet, accomplishes his journey. A priest who speaks is more acceptable than one who is silent. A kinsman who is beneficent excels one who is stingy. 8. A one-footed being advances faster than a two-footed. The two-footed comes after the three-footed.\\(^2\\) The four-footed follows in the rear of the two-footed, and moves on observing his steps. 9. The two hands, though alike, do not perform an equal amount of work. Two cows with the same mother do not yield the same quantity of milk. Two men, though twins, have not the same strength. And two others, though kinsmen, are not equally liberal.\u201d\n\n**Rig Veda, x. 107.**\n\n1. \u201cThe great [lustre] of these opulent ones has been manifested. The whole living [world] has been liberated from darkness. The great light given by the Fathers\\(^3\\) has arrived. The broad path of Largess has been beheld. 2. The givers of gifts abide aloft in the sky; the bestowers of horses live with the Sun; the givers of gold attain immor-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) It is curious to find in so ancient a composition this now trite comparison of the changes of fortune to the revolutions of a wheel. The same idea occurs in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, iii. 16489: \u201cAfter happiness, suffering, and after suffering, happiness, visit a man in succession, as the spokes of a wheel [revolve round] the nave.\u201d According to Herodotus i. 207, Creesus said to Cyrus: \u201cIf thou knowest that even thou art human, and rulest over mortals, learn first this lesson, that in the affairs of men there is a wheel which, by its revolution, renders it impossible for the same persons always to enjoy prosperity.\u201d\n\n\\(^2\\) Professor Aufrecht suggests that the one-footed may mean a cripple, and the three-footed, an old man with his staff.\n\n\\(^3\\) Compare R. V. x. 68, 11. \u201cThe Fathers have adorned the sky with stars . . . and placed darkness in the night, and light in the day.\u201d\ntality; the bestowers of raiment prolong their lives. 3. A gift which is a satisfaction of the gods, an offering to the deities, [proceeds] not from the illiberal; they bestow nothing; and many men of extensive liberality are bountiful merely through fear of reproach. . . . 5. The giver of gifts, invited, advances first; he walks in the front as leader.\u00b9 I regard as the king of men him who first presented a gift. 5. They call him a rishi, a priest, a reverend chanter of hymns and reciter of verses,\u2014he knows the three forms of the resplendent (Agni),\u2014the man who was the first to crown [his religious service] with a gift. 7. Largess bestows a cow, a horse, silver (?) and gold. Largess bestows (?) food, which is our life. The wise man makes largess-giving his breastplate. 8. Bountiful men neither die nor fall into calamity; they suffer neither wrong nor pain. Their liberality confers on them this whole world as well as heaven. 9. The bountiful conquer for themselves first, a pleasant abode, a well-dressed wife, and a draught of wine; they conquer those who walk in the front (?), uninvited. 10. A fleet horse is trained for the generous man; he obtains a brilliant damsel for his portion; this house of his resembles a lotus-pond, beautiful, embellished like a palace of the gods. 11. The liberal man is borne along by rapid horses. The car of largess rolls forward on easy wheels. Preserve, ye gods, the bountiful man in battle. He overcomes his enemies in the fight.\u201d\n\nThe next hymn, from the Atharva Veda, sets forth with great liveliness and vigour the advantages accruing to princes from the employment of a domestic priest.\n\nAtharva Veda, iii. 19.\n\n1. \u201cMay this prayer of mine be successful; may the vigour and strength be complete, may the power be perfect and undecaying, of those of whom I am the victorious priest (purohita). 2. I fortify their kingdom, and augment their\n\n\u00b9 Compare R. V. iv. 50, 8 f, where the prosperity and honor which attend a prince who retains and cherishes a domestic priest are described. See Professor Wilson\u2019s translation, and note on v. 9, in p. 214; and Roth\u2019s Art. on Brahma and the Brahmins, Journ. Germ. Or. Society, i. 77 ff. See also the hymn from the A. V. iii. 19, next quoted in the text.\nenergy, valour, and force. I break the arms of their enemies with this oblation. 3. May all those who fight against our wise and prosperous [prince] sink downward, and be prostrated. With my prayer I destroy his enemies, and raise up his friends. 4. May those of whom I am the priest be sharper than an axe, sharper than fire, sharper than Indra\u2019s thunderbolt. 5. I strengthen their weapons; I prosper their kingdom rich in heroes. May their power be undecaying and victorious. May all the gods foster their designs. 6. May their valorous deeds, o Maghavat, burst forth; may the noise of the conquering heroes arise; may their distinct shouts, their clear yells, go up; may the gods, the Maruts with Indra as their chief, march forward with their host. 7. Go, conquer, ye warriors: may your arms be strong. Ye with the sharp arrows, smite those whose bows are powerless; ye whose weapons and arms are terrible (smite) the feeble. 8. When discharged, fly forth, o arrow, sped by prayer. Vanquish the foes, assail, slay all the choicest of them; let not one escape.\u201d\n\nThe two following hymns from the Atharva Veda declare the guilt, the peril, and disastrous consequences of oppressing Br\u0101hmans, and robbing them of their property. The threats and imprecations of haughty sacerdotal insolence could scarcely be expressed more energetically.\n\n**Atharva Veda, v. 18.**\n\n1. \u201cKing, the gods have not given thee [this cow] to eat: Do not, O R\u0101janya (man of royal descent), seek to devour the Br\u0101hman\u2019s cow, which is not to be eaten. 2. The wicked R\u0101janya, unlucky in play, and self-destroyed, will eat the Br\u0101hmin\u2019s cow, saying, \u2018Let me live to-day, [if I can] not [live] to-morrow.\u2019 3. This cow, clothed with a skin, contains deadly poison, like a snake. Beware, R\u0101janya, she is ill-flavoured, and must not be eaten. 4. He [who eats her] forfeits his strength, destroys his own splendour, consumes everything like a fire which has been kindled. The man who looks upon the Br\u0101hman as mere food to be eaten up, drinks serpent\u2019s poison. 5. Indra kindles a fire\nin the heart of that contemner of the gods who slays the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, esteeming him to be inoffensive, and foolishly covets his property. Heaven and earth abhor the man who [so] acts. 6. A Br\u0101hma\u1e47a is not to be wronged, as fire [must not be touched] by a man who cherishes his own body. Soma is his (the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2019s) kinsman, and Indra shields him from imprecations. 7. The wicked (?) man who thinks the priests\u2019 food is sweet while he is eating it, swallows [the cow] bristling with a hundred sharp points, but cannot digest her. 8. The priest\u2019s tongue is a bow-string, his voice is a barb, and his windpipe is arrow-points smeared with fire. With these god-directed, and heart-subduing bows, the priest pierces the scorers of the gods. Br\u0101hma\u1e47as bearing sharp arrows, armed with missiles, never miss their mark when they discharge a shaft. Shooting with fervour [austerity?] and with anger, they pierce [the enemy] from afar. 10. The descendants of V\u012btahavya who ruled over a thousand men, and were ten hundred in number, were overcome after they had eaten a Brahman\u2019s cow. 11. The cow herself, when she was slaughtered, destroyed them,\u2014those men who cooked the last she-goat of Kesaraprabandh\u0101. 12. Those hundred persons whom the earth shook off, after they had wronged the priestly race, were overwhelmed in an inconceivable manner. 13. He lives among mortals a scorner of the gods; infected with poison he becomes reduced to a skeleton; he who wrongs a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a the kinsman of the deities, fails to attain to the heaven of the Forefathers. 14. Agni is called our leader; Soma our kinsman. Indra neutralizes imprecations [directed against us]; this the wise understand. 15. Like a poisoned arrow, o king, like a serpent, o lord of cows,\u2014such is the dreadful shaft of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, with which he pierces his despisers.\u201d\n\n**Atharva Veda**, v. 19.\n\n1. \u201cThe Srinjayas, descendants of V\u012btahavya, waxed exceedingly; they almost touched the sky; but after they had injured Bhrigu, they were overwhelmed. 2. When men pierced Brihaspaman, a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a descended from Angiras, a\nmen with two wives or each swallowed their children. 3. Those who spit or throw filth upon a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, so eating hair in the midst of a stream of blood. 4. So long as this Br\u0101hma\u1e47a's cow withers when being milked she destroys the glory of the kingdom; no vigorous hero is born there. 5. It is cruel to slaughter her; nor ill-favoured flesh is thrown away. When her milk is drawn, that is esteemed a sin among the Forefathers. 6. Whenever a king, assuming himself mighty, seeks to devour a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, that kingdom is broken up, in which a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a suffers. Becoming eight-lobbed, four-eyed, four-armed, four-faced, two-tongued, she the cow destroys the kingdom of the oppressor of Br\u0101hma\u1e47as. 7. Rain pours down that kingdom, as water swamps a leaky boat; calamity smites that country in which a priest is wronged. 8. Even trees, o \u015aiva\u015ba, repel and refuse their shade to the man who claims a right to the property of a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. This property, as king Varu\u1e47a hath said, has been turned into a prison by the gods. No one who has eaten a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a's cow continues to watch (i.e., to rule) over a country. 11. These nine nations [of persons] whom the earth shook off, when they had wronged the priestly race, were overwhelmed in an inconceivable manner (see v. 12 of the preceding hymn). 12. The gods have declared that the cloth wherewith a dead man's feet are bound shall be thy pall, thou oppressor of priests. 13. The tears which flow from a vanquished man as he laments,\u2014such is the portion of water which the gods have assigned to thee, thou oppressor of priests. 14. The gods have allotted to thee that portion of water wherewith men wash the dead, and moisten their beards. 15. The rain of Mitra and Varu\u1e47a does not descend on the oppressor of priests. For him the battle has never a successful issue; nor does he bring his friend into subjection.\" The attention of the reader is directed to the intensity of contempt and abhorrence which is sought to be conveyed by the coarse imagery contained in vv. 3, and 12-14, of the last preceding hymn.\n\nIn another hymn of the Atharva Veda, v. 17, the two following verses occur regarding the prerogative of Br\u0101hma\u1e47as;\n8. \"And if a woman have had ten former husbands, not Br\u0101hmans, and a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a take her hand (i.e. marry her), he is the only husband. 9. It is a Brahman only who is a husband, and not a R\u0101janya, or a Vai\u1e63ya. The Sun marches on declaring that to the five tribes of men.\"\n\nThe four hymns of the A. V. which follow contain incantations designed to save persons suffering under dangerous diseases, and on the point of death, from death, or rather perhaps to recall their spirits after their separation from the body. They supply various illustrations of the ideas entertained by the Indians of the period when they were composed regarding the vital principle, the relations of the different senses to the several elements, the deities by whom men's tenure of life was regulated, the power of incantations to arrest the approach of doom, and other kindred particulars.\n\nAtharva Veda, v. 30.\n\n\"1. From thy vicinity, from thy vicinity, from a distance, from thy vicinity [I call] to thee: remain here; do not follow, do not follow, the early Fathers. I firmly hold back thy breath. 2. Whatever incantations any kinsman or stranger has uttered against thee,\u2014with my voice I declare thy release and deliverance from them all. 3. Whatever hurt thou hast done, or curse thou hast spoken, in thy folly, against woman or man, with my voice, etc. 4.

May my parents have received no injury from me, when I, a son, in sucking, squeezed my mother and father in my delight.\" Compare also R.

Fear not; thou shalt not die; I make thee long-lived. I have charmed out of thy members the consumption by which they are wasted. 9. The consumption which racks and wastes thy limbs, and sickens thy heart, has flown away to a distance like a hawk, overcome by my word. 10. The two sages, Alert and Watchful, the sleepless, and the vigilant, these the guardians of thy life, are awake both day and night. 11. May this adorable Agni rise here to thee as a sun. Rise up from deep death,\\(^1\\) yea even from black darkness.\\(^2\\) 12. Reverence to Yama, reverence to Death, reverence to the Fathers, and to those who guide us. I place in front of this [sick] man, for his security, Agni who knows how to carry him across. 13. Let his breath, let his soul, let his sight come, and then his strength; let his body acquire sensation, and stand firm upon its feet. 14. Provide him, Agni, with breath, and with sight; restore him, furnished with a body, and with strength.\\(^3\\) Thou hast the knowledge of immortality; let him not depart, or become a dweller in a house of clay. 15. Let not thy inhaled breath cease; let not thy exhaled breath vanish. Let the sun, the lord, raise thee up from death by his rays. 16. This tongue speaks within, bound, convulsive. By thee, I have charmed away the consumption, and the hundred torments of the fever. 17. This world is the dearest, unconquered by the gods. To whatever death thou wast destined when thou wast born\u2014we call after thee, do not die before thou art worn out by old age.\u201d\n\n**Atharva Veda**, vii. 53.\n\n1. \u201cBrihaspati, thou hast delivered us from dwelling in the realm of Yama, from the curse. Asvins,\u2014ye who, o Agni, are the two physicians of the Gods,\u2014ye have repelled death from us by your powers. 2.

Enter into him, ye two breaths, like two steers forcing their way into a cow-pen. May this man flourish here, an unmolested depositary of old age. 6. We invigorate thy life. I drive away consumption from thee. May this excellent Agni sustain our life on every side. Ascending from the darkness to the uppermost heaven, we have reached, among the gods, the god S\u00fbrya, the highest luminary.\"\n\n**Atharva Veda, viii. 1.**\n\n1. \"Reverence to Death the Ender! May thy inhaled and exhaled breaths rejoice here. May this man remain here united with his spirit in the domain of the sun, in the world of deathlessness. 2. Bhaga and Soma with his filaments, the divine Maruts, Indra, and Agni, have raised him up to health. Here is thy spirit, here thy breath, here thy life, here thy soul. We rescue thee from the bonds of Nirriti by a divine utterance. 4. Rise up hence, o man. Casting off the fetters of death, do not sink downward. Do not depart from this world, from the sight of Agni and the Sun. 5. May the Wind, M\u00e2tar\u00ee\u015bvan, blow for thee; may the waters shower immortality (or ambrosia) on thee; may the Sun shine healingly upon thy body; may Death pity thee; do not die. 6.

Do not follow this path; it is terrible; I speak of that by which thou hast not hitherto gone. This, o man, is darkness; do not enter it. Beyond, thou hast fear; on this side, thou hast security. 11. May the fires which are in the waters preserve thee; may the fire which men kindle preserve thee; may J\u0101tavedas Vai\u015bv\u0101nara (the fire which is common to all men) preserve thee; let not the celestial fire together with the lightning, consume thee. 12. Let not the flesh-devouring fire\\(^1\\) be hostile to thee; go far from that wicked one. May the sky, the earth, the sun, and moon, preserve thee; may the air protect thee from the bolt of the gods. 13. May Wakeful and Watchful, may the sleepless and the waking preserve thee. May the guardian and the vigilant protect thee. 14. May they protect and guard you. To them be reverence. 15. May V\u0101yu, Indra, Dh\u0101tri, and Savitri the deliverer, restore thee to converse with the living. Let not breath and strength abandon thee; we call back thy spirit. 16. Let not any violent devourer, let not darkness find thee. May the \u0100dityas and Vasus, with Indra and Agni, raise thee up to health. 17. The sky, the earth, Praj\u0101pati have rescued thee. The plants with Soma their king, have delivered thee from death. 18. Let this man remain here, o gods; let him not depart hence to the other world. We rescue him from death with a charm of boundless efficacy (sahasra-v\u012bryyena). 19. I have delivered thee from death; may the vigorous breathe upon thee.\\(^2\\) Let not the she-devils with dishevelled hair, or those that howl dreadfully, yell at thee. 20. I have snatched thee; I have caught thee; thou hast returned renewed. I have got, o man perfect in thy members, thy entire eye, and thy entire life. 21. [Life] has breathed upon thee. Light has come to thee. Darkness has departed from thee. We remove from thee death, Nirriti and consumption.\"\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) There are three kinds of fire, the kray\u0101d, or funeral (here referred to), which devours dead bodies, the culinary (\u0101ma\u1e0d), and the sacrificial. See the V\u0101j. S. i. 17, and the commentary there.\n\n\\(^2\\) See the 4th verse of the next hymn.\nATHARVA VEDA, viii. 2.\n\n1. \"Seize this boon of immortality; may long life, which cannot be cut off, be thine. I restore to thee breath and life; do not depart to the mist (rajas) or to darkness (tamas); do not die. 2. Come hither to the light of the living; I rescue thee that thou mayest survive a hundred autumns. Loosing the bands of death and imprecation, I lengthen out thy existence. 3. I have recovered thy breath from the wind, thine eye from the sun.\\(^1\\) I place in thee thy soul. Receive sensation in thy limbs. Speak, articulating with thy tongue. 4. I blow upon thee with the breath of bipeds, and of quadrupeds, as on Agni when he is born (\\textit{i.e.} on fire when kindled). I have paid reverence, o Death, to thine eye, and to thy breath. 5. Let this man live and not die. We restore him. I make for him a remedy. Death, do not kill the man. I invoke for his safety a vivifying . . . . , living, delivering, strong, and powerful plant. 7. Befriend him; do not seize him; let him go; though he is thine only, let him abide here with all his strength; o Bhava and \u0160arva, be gracious; grant deliverance; remove evil, and confer life. 8. Befriend him, Death, pity him; let him arise. Unharmed, with all his limbs, hearing perfectly, let him obtain enjoyment during a life of a hundred years. 9. May the shaft of the gods pass thee by; I bring thee across from the mist (see v. 1); I have rescued thee from death. Removing far away the flesh-devouring Agni, I draw round thee a circle (see R. V. x. 18, 4) that thou mayest live. 10. Preserving him from that misty egress of thine, o Death, which no one may escape by menaces, we make prayer a protection for him. 11. I give thee thy breaths, death at thy full age,\\(^2\\) long life and health. I drive away all the messengers of Yama, who roam about, sent by the son of Vivasvat. 12. We remove afar evil, Nirriti, Gr\u00e2hi, and flesh-devouring Pis\u00e2chas, and hurl all wicked Rakshases, as\n\n\\(^1\\) See my paper on Yama, p. 294, note 7. \\(^2\\) Compare A. V. xix. 24, 4, 6, 8.\nit were into darkness. 13. I seek thy life from the immortal, living, Agni J\u0101tavedas. I procure that thou mayest suffer no injury, that thou mayest also be immortal. May this be the fortunate result. 14. May heaven and earth in unison be auspicious and innocuous to thee. May the sun shine and the wind blow pleasantly to thy heart. May the celestial streaming waters drop down upon thee favourably. 15. May the plants be auspicious to thee. I have raised thee from the lower to the upper earth. There may both the sons of Aditi, the Sun and the Moon, preserve thee. 16. Whatever garment for clothing, or whatever girdle thou makest for thyself, we cause it to be agreeable to thy body; may it be soft to thy touch. 17. When, as a barber, thou shavest our hair and beard with a sharp and cleansing razor, while cleansing our face, do not rob us of our life. 18. Let the rice and barley be auspicious to thee, innocuous, undisturbing. These destroy consumption, and deliver from suffering. 19. Whatever thou eatest or drinkest, the grain derived from husbandry, or liquid, whatever is or is not to be eaten\u2014all that food I render for thee free from poison. 20. We commit thee to both the Day and the Night: preserve him for me from the goblins who seek to devour him. 21. We allot to thee a hundred, ten thousand, years, two, three, four, ages (yugas). May Indra and Agni, may all the gods regard thee favourably, without anger. 22. We commit thee to autumn, winter, spring, summer. May the rains be pleasant to thee, in which the plants grow up. 23. Death rules over bipeds; death rules over quadrupeds. From that Death the ruler I rescue thee; do not fear. 24. Thou who art uninjured shalt not die; thou shalt not die; do not fear.

III.\u2014Five Hundred Questions on the Social Condition of the Natives of Bengal. By the Rev. J. Long, of Calcutta.\n\n(Read before the Royal Asiatic Society, 19th June, 1865).\n\nDesiderata and Inquiries connected with the Presidency of Madras and Bombay were issued by the Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1827, on points relating to the language, literature, ancient history of families, antiquities, coins, people, architecture, landed tenures, arts and manufactures, of India.\n\nThe British Admiralty has published a Manual of Scientific Enquiry, so have the Statistical and other Societies.\n\nHaxthausen, in his work on the Caucasus, remarks: \"My travels and observations during more than twenty years, have convinced me that an acquaintance with the manners of a people, their moral and material interests, domestic relations, corporate associations, and specially the commercial relations of the lower classes, is indispensable to a real knowledge of the history and constitution of peoples and states.\"\n\nThe present time seems favourable in India to prosecute enquiries on this subject; with the rapid spread of education literary tastes are springing up among natives.\n\nThe following five hundred questions and desiderata\u2014suggestive of a wide range of subjects, on \"the proper study of mankind is man\"\u2014shew that a wide field is opened out for enquiry into the social life of the natives of India and their folk-lore, a species of knowledge not to be found exclusively in books, but mainly in the memories and traditions of the people. These questions were framed by the Rev. J. Long, in Calcutta, for an Association of educated native\n\n1 The majority of these questions are applicable to natives in other parts of India.\ngentlemen of which he was the President; they were designed to map out the field of action on subjects relating to native social life in India.\n\nNow is the time to \"note the passing manners as they fly.\" Hindu society in various parts of India is in a transition state, and it is desirable to treasure up in writing the records of the past and the passing; an educated class of natives is rapidly rising, qualified not only to investigate but also to write in English the results of their investigations; literary societies, and periodical literature, are increasing among them. Natives alone can penetrate into native society. Europeans must remain on the surface; but the two classes can work in harmony. The natives are able and willing to supply the data and facts,\u2014while the European can classify and arrange them on the plan laid down by Statistical and Sociological Societies, and publish them hereafter for the information of persons both in Europe and the East.\n\nThere is a wide field opened out, as the five hundred questions and desiderata in this paper shew, and the co-operation of the following classes of Europeans in India is earnestly solicited:\n\n1. Collectors, Magistrates, and Commissioners in Districts, who, associating much among the people, might through their native employ\u00e9s secure a large amount of valuable information on various points, and would find the inquiry profitable to themselves in promoting good feeling between them and the natives, deepening their interest in the country and occasionally relieving the tedium of a solitary hour.\n\n2. European Settlers would find these questions of use in gaining a better acquaintance with the social condition of the natives with whom they are thrown so much in contact; it would shew them that natives can talk and think of other subjects besides rupees, while on the other hand the natives would see that the Sahibs are not mere indigo, tea and coffee producing machines, but take an interest in the welfare and condition of their dependents,\u2014thus the asperities arising from antagonism of race would be softened.\n\n3. Principals and Teachers in Schools and Colleges, would\nfind many of these questions suitable as subjects for essays to be given to native students, testing and calling out not only their powers of composition, but also their faculties of observation and knowledge of common things,\u2014checking the tendency of education to make mere book-worms, separated from and having few sympathies with the masses.\n\n4. Missionaries in their itinerancies and in mixing with the natives have excellent opportunities of filling up these gaps in our ignorance of social life, and by conversation on social questions of smoothing down any rancour that may arise from theological discussion.\n\n5. Students of the Vernacular, and Travellers, would find an ample supply of materials for conversation with natives and teachers, which would in an agreeable manner facilitate the study of the vernacular.\n\nI.\n\nABORIGINES.\n\nThe Dhangars and other hill tribes who do such important though dirty work in the drainage of Calcutta, are deserving notice as to their habitations, religion, customs, language. Sir J. Malcom\u2019s Essay on the Bhils\u2014Hodgson\u2019s valuable papers on the Aboriginal tribes, etc., suggest various subjects of enquiry. Dr. Pritchard, Hodgson, etc., etc., devoted much labour to it; and Sir G. Grey, when Governor of New Zealand, learned the language of the Aborigines, and has since published a most interesting work on \u201cthe Poetry of the New Zealanders.\u201d He lived among them for a time, and has recorded all their legends, traditions, etc. The Maoris living in the ultima Thule of civilization speak a language in which there are many words derived from Sanskrit. The Santals, met with one hundred miles from Calcutta, use a language having strong affinities with that of the Tartars of Central Asia, who are Russian subjects. The Hindu poetical legends describe those aborigines as monkeys; Megasthenes writes of them as one-eyed, without noses, wrapped up in their ears (hastikarnas).\n\n1. The mode of living, habits, morals; and food of the Dhangars,\nand other aborigines in foreign places, contrasted with their native place?\n\n2. Ditto of the hill men who go as coolies to the Mauritius, Ceylon, and the West Indies.\n\n3. The social position and relation of the coolies to Zemindars on their return, how far do they acquire habits of thought and independence, a knowledge of improved means of cultivation, a taste for a higher order of amusements, and a greater pride of personal appearance?\n\n4. Do the wives and families of the Aboriginal emigrants accompany them in their emigrations? What connexion do they keep up with their native villages?\n\n5. The ceremonies observed by the Aborigines, etc., at births, marriages, funerals? What mode have they of settling their disputes? How far do they believe in witchcraft, omens?\n\n6. Any traces of the Aborigines ever having lived in the plains of India?\n\nII.\n\nAGRICULTURAL CLASSES.\n\nHow desirable it would be in India to see the native landlord, like the English country gentleman, attending agricultural shows\u2014joining with his tenants in the sports of the field\u2014administering justice on the bench\u2014sympathising with the peasants in their difficulties\u2014deriving, from an agricultural education, that scientific knowledge of rural husbandry which would interest him in the country, and thus enable him to be independent of the false information of the agent (gomasta).\n\n1. How far is the charge true that the ryot is lazy\u2014if so, is it owing to his not having a proper incentive to industry, or to his natural disposition?\n\n2. In what cases have ryots risen to be peasant proprietors?\u2014what effect would a class of peasant proprietors have on cultivation as compared with large capitalists? Would the results be similar to those in France, where peasant proprietorship fosters economy, a respect for property, forethought and industry?\n\n3. How far are zemindars, absentees?\u2014the causes, remedies?\n\n4. To what extent is a taste for gardening spreading among zemindars, and educated natives\u2014how could it be more extensively promoted as a morning amusement for natives in offices? instances of any natives who have devoted much time and money to gardening.\n5. How far could public gardens be established in native towns?\n6. In what respect would the introduction of the study of agricultural chemistry and of the elements of Botany in a popular form in Anglo-Vernacular schools tend to lessen that gulph which now exists between the educated classes and the rural population?\n7. The practicability of evening classes for teaching the ryots to read.\n8. How far are the ryots becoming more aware of \"the great world beyond their market town?\"\n9. Poverty among the ryots, how pre-disposing to disease? to cheating?\n10. Would an encumbered estate commission, which has worked so well in Ireland, be suited for India?\n11. Is there a strong desire among ryots for the possession of land, so as to lead to habits of prudence and economy?\n12. Are there many remains of old Jaghires in Bengal?\n13. Is the minute sub-division of land according to Hindu law carried out much? what are its effects?\n14. The proportion of landholders to the rest of the population?\n15. To what extent do the ryots purchase things not produced in their own district?\n16. Any cases of poor ryots who have risen to be zemindars or to a good social position?\n17. Many sub-tenures amounting to ten?\n18. Do many of the rural population emigrate to towns? the effects on their morals and on wages?\n19. To what extent are the zemindars \"rotting in idleness?\" its causes and remedies?\n20. Are the ryots as attached to their native villages as formerly?\n21. Has the naib (agent) as much influence as formerly over the zemindar?\n22. Are zemindars as litigious as formerly?\n23. Are the peasantry, though unlettered, not ignorant? Give examples, illustrations.\n24. Signs of agricultural improvement within the last twenty years as contrasted with manufacturing improvement?\n\n---\n\n1 In the North West Provinces of India in 1852, 10,000 Rupees were spent by Government in the establishment of public gardens. The author of Seir Mutakherim remarked last century \"a garden, an orchard\u2014being time out of mind as free to all the world all over India as is a well or a tank, nothing amazes and disgusts the Hindustaneees more when they come to Calcutta than to find so many seats and gardens all shut up.\"\n\n2 I have met with cases of evening schools attended solely by ryota. In England one per cent. of the rural population attend such schools. In France 12 per cent. In Russia they are rapidly on the increase.\n25. How far is there a growth of a feeling of independence among ryots? its causes and probable results?\n26. Are Middlemen on the increase? the evils inflicted by them in rack-renting, etc., etc.\n27. The condition of the ryots before the Permanent Settlement, and their relation at that period to the landlords?\n28. The different abwabs (fees) levied by zamindars?\n29. Torture, how far practised now and formerly? the different modes?\n\nIII.\n\nASTROLOGY AND WITCHCRAFT.\n\nHuman nature in India, as in Europe, wishes to pry into the future, whether the fingers, the chattering of crows, or the stars are to be guides; in India the feeling against witches even lately was as strong as in England two centuries ago, thus in Mhow between 1800 and 1823, 2,500 witches were put to death.\u00b9\n\n1. Charmers for snake bites, their numbers, pay, and how far really successful? the influence of music over snakes?\n2. Are reputed Expellers of Bhuts or Devils many, their influence?\n3. Various kinds of mantras, such as the panch mantra, etc., etc.?\n4.

Mesmerism (Jh\u00e1r\u00e1n Mantra), to what extent known to the old Hindus\u2014how practised now and by whom?\n8. Sleight-of-hand tricks, the number and emoluments of its professors\u2014instances of common tricks practised in Bengal?\n9. Belief in Fairies, Apparitions, illustrations of its extent and influence? much on the decline?\n10. Gypsies or Natha, their numbers, morals, means of support? influence among the people, language, religion, ceremonies at marriages, births, funerals?\n11. Are casting the evil eye and other incantations common?\n\n\u00b9 See the Asiatic Annual Register, 1801; the Asiatic Journal 1823, on trials for witchcraft among Hindus.\n12. Treasure-finders,\u2014thief detectors, fortune-tellers, astrologers, their numbers, profits?\n13. Dreams, various kinds of? who interpret them? their profits? analysis of vernacular books that treat of them?\n14. Omens, Charms, and signs of futurity, various kinds in use?\n\nIV.\n\nBeggars and Vagrants.\n\nThe beggar class are not unworthy of consideration in India\u2014in England they are the subjects of various books: who does not remember Burns\u2019s poem on the Jolly Beggars, or some of the exquisite traits about them in Goldsmith\u2019s and Crabbe\u2019s Poems?\n\n1. The proportion of beggars from choice or from necessity, or on religious grounds?\n2. The extent of beggars\u2019 beats?\u2014more beggars in town or country? their profits, their amusements?\n3. Are beggars much addicted to thieving or other crimes? Do many beggars feign blindness, dumbness, lameness, or practise other impositions?\n4. Fakirs or Sanyasis\u2014their habits, beat, profits, impositions,\u2014which are worse, Hindu or Musulman fakirs? why do they call themselves Padris?\n5. Mendicant musicians\u2014their number, profits, skill, social position? Vagrant tradesmen, ditto.\n6. Is not the present indiscriminate charity to beggars the mother of idleness and crime?\n7.

Do many beggars flock to towns? the causes? how far is the want of peasant proprietorship a cause of beggary?\n\nV.\n\nCalcutta.\n\nCalcutta, the \u201ccity of palaces and pigsties,\u201d requires a separate Sociological niche for itself,\u2014yet how little is really known of this colluvies of nations! Purnea furnishes to it\nsyces,\u2014Orissa, bearers,\u2014Behar, Durwans,\u2014Central India, opium merchants,\u2014Kabul, horses and fruit-sellers,\u2014Chittagong, boatmen;\u2014while those semi-Asiatics, the Greeks, supply leading merchants.\n\nIn prosecuting enquiries on the various classes of population, the trades and handicrafts in Calcutta and the large cities of India, there is a model paper on that subject, published in the Royal Asiatic Society's Transactions, in relation to Bareilly, 1826, vol. i. pp. 467-484, treating of the progress in civilization, dress, amusements, food, houses, peculiar usages, habits and wants of the people of Bareilly.

Any probability of approximating the Hindus and East Indians in closer mutual sympathy\u2014was the aversion less in former days than now?\n\n4. The Portuguese\u2014how many of European origin, their peculiar customs and mode of life? their influence over natives? their morals and energy as contrasted with those of natives?\n\n\u00b9 That is, placing the first fruits of grain in harvest time at the door.\n5. The use of a native landed aristocracy as a shield against the despotism of a ruler or of a multitude?\n\n6. Are there many black Brahmins? is their colour the effect of climate? are they of Hindu origin?\n\n7. The duration of life among the upper and lower classes of Hindus, and the professional classes particularly, as showing the effect of temperance, mental occupation and bodily exercise?\n\n8. Are old men very garrulous? are there many old men? to what age have some lived?\n\n9. Caste, how far on the decline, and the causes of the decline? are the varna sankars or mixed castes on the increase? illustrations of the lower castes rising in the social scale, the causes? are the rules for expulsion from caste strictly observed?\n\n10. Families that existed before the Muhammedan invasion.\n\nVIII.\n\nCOMMERCE.\n\nThe commercial classes in India have always occupied a conspicuous place; even in Menu's time they held the purse strings, and have been less than other classes subject to priestly influence; hence the great sects of Jains in Rajputana and Central India, the Oswals of Behar, and Vaishnavs of Bengal have the greatest number of converts among the traders; the Marwari merchants are Jains, and the Ghossains are Vaishnavs. Religious reform found its votaries most in France among the Huguenot merchants; in the middle ages among the Belgian and Italian traders; and in Russia among the mercantile classes; the municipalities in the middle ages, mainly composed of the trading classes, were buffers against feudal and priestly oppression.\n\n1. Why do Buniyas (shop keepers) in Behar rank with Vaisyas? their education and social position in Bengal\u2014are many of them sureties\u2014many foreigners among them\u2014their profits?\n\n2. Mahajans (money lenders) how far do their exactions extend\u2014are they less now than formerly\u2014their numbers\u2014do many rise to a high position in native society?\n\n3. The native merchant princes\u2014their rise and social influence\u2014do their sons follow their father's pursuits?\n\n4. To what extent has the decay in ancient Indian articles of\nproduction and trade been compensated by new sources of production and trade?\n\n5. Indigo; the accounts of it in Hindu books\u2014also of tobacco, sugar, cotton?\n\n6. The influences of foreign trade on the dress, food, habits, opinions, of natives?\n\n7. How far are native merchants likely to form a quasi aristocracy, or an upper middle class?\n\n8. Native merchants, how far liable to the charge of ostentation, avarice, vulgarity? how far do they rise into a higher grade, and their conduct in it?\n\n9. The effect of commercial legislature on commercial morality, as shown in the Small Cause and Insolvent Courts?\n\n10. Shroffs (bankers), their number, emoluments, social position?\n\n11. Causes of the decreasing social intercourse between Europeans and natives\u2014remedies?\n\nIX.\n\nCONVERSATION AND SOCIAL INTERCOURSE.\n\nConversation, or the \"feast of reason and the flow of soul,\" is as popular with the Bengali as with the European.\n\n1. The subjects of conversation 20 years ago as contrasted with the present.\n\n2. The subjects of conversation common to the educated and uneducated classes.\n\n3. The favourite times for conversation; how different from the English?\n\n4. Do any classes converse on subjects not relating to their daily life and occupations?\n\n5. Are Riddles much used?\u2014a collection of them a desideratum.\n\n6. Jesters how far employed, their numbers and emoluments\u2014is jesting much used? illustrations of it?\n\n7. Vaishnavs' or Saktas' conversation\u2014how do they differ in subject and moral tone?\n\n8. Is there much discussion in Hindoo society\u2014on what topics? is it angry at times?\n\n9. The effect on conversation of the absence of female society?\n\n10. Topics in the zenana, among educated, uneducated? among country or town people?\n\n11. Among what classes are Ghost stories most common? mention twelve specimens of different kinds.\n\n1 In the Pancha Tantra, a work twelve centuries old at least, we have an account of a jackal who tumbled into an indigo vat.\nX.\n\nCRIMINAL, OR DANGEROUS, CLASSES.\n\n1. How can a system of education be extended adapted to the circumstances of those who form the raw materials of the dangerous and criminal classes?\n\n2. How far is poverty the parent of crime in Bengal? Do oppression? Do the Guru Mahashay system?\n\n3. Jails, how far objects of terror and shame to natives? In what districts is the name \"our father-in-law's house\" given to the jail? Are re-committals frequent? Are Reformatories for juvenile criminals desirable? The effect of teaching prisoners agriculture?\n\n4. Is the thannah looked upon as a school where old offenders teach young ones crime?\n\n5. Receivers of stolen goods; any approximate estimate of their number and profits?\n\n6. Has the punishment of death much effect in lessening capital offences?\n\n7. The proportion that can read and write intelligibly in the different jails?\u00b9\n\n8. Is infanticide common among the poor?\u00b2 Do incest?\n\n9. Is perjury or forgery on the increase? The causes?\n\n10. River Thagi common? Ditto professional poisoners?\n\n11. The influence of age and sex on crime?\n\n12. Crime in different districts, and in various castes, particularly among Hindus and Muhammadans, how it differs in number, variety, heinousness?\n\n13. Is there more crime in town or in the country?\n\n14. Juvenile delinquents; their number, offences?\n\n15. Has the autobiography of a thief ever been written?\n\n16. Is Professor Wilson's remark correct, \"in the great towns of India the profligacy bears no comparison to that of London or Paris?\"\n\nXI.\n\nDEBATING SOCIETIES.\n\nDebating Societies or Literary Clubs have sprung up in shoals both in Calcutta and the Mofussil within the last twelve\n\n\u00b9 In Liverpool it was ascertained lately that out of 19,336 persons apprehended in nine months, only 3 per cent. could read or write well enough for any available purpose.\n\n\u00b2 It is so in the manufacturing districts of England, and among the Rajputs.\nyears; they are nuclei for educated young men, and are congenial to the oriental habit which loves dals: we need a kind, however, like the Young Men's Associations of England, in which not only lectures might be delivered or essays read, but night classes might be formed for improvement in literature and science.\n\n1. The number and duration of Debating Societies in cities during the last twenty years, the subjects discussed and social status of the members?\n2. Ditto in the country?\n3. In what respects are they improving as to the choice of subjects and the mode of conducting the meetings?\n4. What social influence do they exercise in the family or on others?\n5. A history of the Dharma Sabha, its leaders, quarrels, influence?\n6. Of the Brahma Sabha, ditto, ditto?\n7. Account of any other meetings or reunions among Hindus with their social influence?\n\nXII.\n\nDiseases.\n\n1. The social and moral causes of insanity among natives? Among what castes is it more prevalent, and why?\n2. Are Albinos numerous, the causes?\n3. What nervous diseases are regarded as being from a bhut (demon), requiring mantras?\n4. Nakra\u2014Inoculation for small pox\u2014Leprosy,\u2014their respective modes of treatment in ancient and modern times? how they differ? are lepers now treated kindly?\n5. Hindu Physicians, their various remedies for eye diseases?\n6. Are diseases from dissipation among Young Bengal on the increase?\n7. What diseases indicate the social condition of the people, such as those of the eye, brain?\n8. Hospitals, by what castes most attended, particularly Brahmins, Khaistas, Musulmans\u2014and from what localities?\n9. The relative mortality and vitality of each sex, and of the leading castes in Bengal.\n10. Is the duration of life in inverse ratio to fecundity?\n11. The influence of employments on health in Bengal, how shewn?\nSOCIAL CONDITION OF THE NATIVES OF BENGAL.\n\n12. Various remedies for snake bites? any of real efficacy?\n13. Native medicines, in what estimation held by educated natives?\n14. Is mortality in parturition on the increase?\n15. Was Cholera an epidemic among natives a century ago?\n\nXIII.\n\nDoctors.\n\nThe kabiraj (indigenous doctor) is a great favourite in native society and has been the cause of an enormous number of deaths. The Bengali class of the Medical College is, as it gradually develops, lessening this evil; Dr. Wise has written ably on this class and on Hindu medicine.\n\n1. Kabirajis, whether are Hindu or Musulman ones more numerous or more skilful\u2014their castes\u2014their pay now and in former days?\n2. Inoculators, are there more Hindus or Musulmans\u2014the incantations used\u2014their invocations of Sitola\u2014their fees\u2014caste\u2014mode of treatment?\n3. Vaidyas (native doctors), their chief localities in Bengal, the proportion that can read Sanskrit, their pay and social position\u2014an account of the Atai Vaidyas, Dehatu Vaidyas, Chasi Vaidyas, Haturya Vaidyas?\n4. Midwives, Cuppers, Leech sellers, their skill, pay, numbers?\n5. English educated native doctors, are their social position and pay increasing?\n6. Ditto Bengali educated?\n\nXIV.\n\nDomestic.\n\nHome has well been styled the \u201cseed vessel of society, where the next generation must germinate.\u201d\n\n1. Is hospitality as much practised now as formerly? and with as rigid a regard to caste?\n2. The home influences of wives and daughters on educated natives?\n3. Is the family tie very strong among Hindus? illustrate by examples.\nXV.\n\nDRAMAS, JATRAS.\n\nThe Sanskrit Drama, so well translated by Dr. Wilson, presents a rich harvest of information on the social condition of the Indian aristocracy, females and Pandits, eighteen centuries ago. In the S\u00e1rad\u00e1 tilaka of the twelfth century, we have sketches of the various classes of females, of the Jogis, Buddhists, snake catchers, Pandits; the Mrigantekh\u00e1 treats of the kings of Kalinga and Assam\u2014as the Ramayan does of society 2,500 years ago. Nor have the last ten years been barren in the department of dramatic vernacular literature\u2014as the many Bengali dramas on the subjects of \"Kulinism,\" \"Widow re-marriage,\" etc. show.\n\n1. Account of the bhaurs or professional jesters.\n2. A list of the various j\u00e1tres, their authors, subjects, influence.\n3. Ditto R\u00e1as.\n4. An analysis of the vernacular dramas written during the last twenty years.\n\nXVI.\n\nDRESS.\u00b9\n\n1. Is the Musulman dress superior in any points to the Hindu?\n2. Was the needle totally unknown to the Hindu? is there any Hindu word to express sewing with the needle?\u00b2\n3. Do any Hindus now object to garments made by a Moslem needle?\n4. Were there any tailors in ancient times among the Hindus?\n5. Do Hindu females wash their linen often\u2014is soap coming into use among them?\n\n\u00b9 A suitable dress for females, decent, yet national, is a desideratum. Some Hindu females have adopted the English dress, but they look exactly like Portuguese Ayahs, or the black dolls that hang in London over pawn-brokers' shops. Why should this be? The s\u00e1ri, it is true, is not sufficient, but in Bahar we find the petticoat (lohang\u00e1) and bodice (kurta) have been introduced from the west of India, and more than one-fourth of the Bahar women have adopted it. Some of the Rajput women in Bahar use long-drawers like the Musulman ladies. The males are better off as to dress, but in their disuse of the turban, substituting for it a cap, they benefit only the eye doctors and spectacle makers, furnishing them with more patients,\u2014as the eyes having no shade like what the turban gives, become weak;\u2014such has been the case in Egypt, since the Turkish Fez has been introduced.\n\n\u00b2 S\u00e1ri properly means passing the shuttle in the act of weaving.\nSOCIAL CONDITION OF THE NATIVES OF BENGAL.\n\n6. What Hindus will not drink water out of a girl's hands unless she is first tattooed on the arms and breast?\n7. Would the wearing of beards be useful for Hindus?\n8. Should Hindus take off their shoes in an European house, or their turbans on entering a place of worship?\n\nXVII.\n\nDRINKING HABITS.\n\nIn Menu's days liquors were allowed, and ancient Hindu history gives many a curious revelation on this point.\n1. Are drinking habits more prevalent among the Hindus or among Musulmans? how was it 30 years ago compared with the present time?\n2. Are Hindus quarrelsome in their cups?\n3. Is smoking Ganja, Charus, or Opium more destructive;\u2014which is more common? Do Hindu females smoke much? When was smoking introduced? Ditto snuffing?\n4. How far is the increase of drinking owing to domestic discomfort?\n5. How far do crimes attended with violence, arise from intoxication? how far is insanity the result of intemperance?\n6. The effect of intemperance in producing pauperism?\n7. The connection between abkari shops, public-houses, and crime?\n8. Is drinking brandy a frequent practice with Young Bengal?\n\nXVIII.\n\nEDUCATION, IN ITS SOCIAL BEARING.\n\nThe consideration of the School system in its social influences is a very important subject, as well as the enquiry, how far the competitive system is injurious so far as it treats boys as race horses,\u2014trains them not for general use but to run for particular prizes,\u2014promotes cramming, and mere book-knowledge;\u2014leads to the neglect of the mass of the boys in a school, tempting the Masters, by attending to a few \"fugle boys,\" to gain more praise for their school.\n\nThere is a tendency among Hindus like the man in the fable, to cry out nothing like leather, and to regard education as the panacea for all evils. Lord Brougham describes such persons as being like those who would trust to the effects of\ndiet and regimen when the plague is raging, and Dr. Arnold remarked, \"Education is wanted to improve the physical condition of the people: and yet their physical condition must be improved, before they can be susceptible of education.\" You may educate the upper classes highly, but the masses are the basis of the social pyramid; without this being secure, the apex has no stability; brute force and the black cap are at best but temporary expedients.\n\n1. How far are improved habits of cleanliness, order, punctuality, truthfulness, an improved standard of dress and living, and a development of character promoted by Anglo-Vernacular Schools?\n\n2. Ditto by Guru Mahashay or village Schools?\n\n3. The action of Anglo-Vernacular and Guru Mahashay Schools on the family circle in raising the moral and intellectual tone?\n\n4. Any social evils arising from the training adopted for native girls in some Mission female schools? The remedy?\n\n5. How far are the following remarks, made in England, applicable to India?\n\n\"There is a practical standard in the minds of the people, beyond which the education of the masses cannot be carried. If Government raise the standard, people diminish the time of children's attendance.\"\n\n6. The social importance of teaching in all schools, the doctrines of political economy on labour, capital, wages, interchange, money,\u2014as also the elements of agricultural chemistry.\n\n7. Mental ignorance, how far productive of moral depravity?\n\n8. How far do social discomforts fret and enfeeble the masses, and render them unfit for higher thoughts?\n\n9. Is intemperance greater in proportion among the educated or uneducated classes?\n\n10. How far is the following statement, made by an educated native, correct?\n\n\"Natives educated in the Government Colleges, do not often fulfil the hope inspired by their academic career; they do not follow up their studies; they unlearn what they have learnt, sink in the mass with all the enervating environments of Indian life\u2014the hookah and the zenana do their sure work.\"\n\n11. Does not the social condition of the masses render a grant-in-aid system as inapplicable, as would be a voluntary system at the time of plague and pestilence?\n\n---\n\n1 Dr. Mouat, Inspector of Jails in Bengal, shows in his Returns for 1860, that out of 73,000 criminals in the Bengal and Behar jails that year, 93 per cent. were utterly ignorant of reading and writing.\n12. How far does school education mould the social institutions of the country and how far is it moulded by them?\n13. The social importance of schools of Industrial art?\n14. Ditto ditto of Agricultural schools?\n15. The tolas (or Sanskrit Colleges)\u2014the social causes leading to their decline. Any improvement in the subjects taught, or the mode of teaching? What great teachers are there now?\n16. The probable reflex influence of requiring a knowledge of reading and writing from all classes, as a qualification for office?\n17. The probable influence of the university examination in giving a preponderance to cramming and memory work, to the neglect of cultivating the faculty of observation?\n18. Is it desirable that up to 6 years of age girls should be taught with boys?\u00b9\n19. How far are the Guru Mahashays, as a class, guilty of the charges of teaching their pupils theft and lying, and of inflicting severe punishments? What has been the occupation of the fathers of those teachers generally?\n20. A list of Vernacular authors and able teachers produced by the Sanskrit Colleges?\n\nXIX.\n\nFEMALES.\n\n1. How far are the following remarks on Hindu females correct in different localities: \"Ministers to the capricious sensuality of their arrogant lords.\u2014The feeling of natural affection is comparatively weak\u2014held under the jealousy of restraint, they become callous to all finer sensibilities?\" Cases of crim. con. very seldom occur in respectable Hindu families. The life of a Hindu widow is wretched in the highest degree.\n2. To what extent can natch (dancing) girls read? their influences and emolument now as compared with former days?\n3. Do Hindu females often hear religious or other books read to them?\u00b2\n4. What is the knowledge females acquire independent of books?\n5. Mention female authors of past and present times.\n6. Is the practice of females blackening their teeth and eyes, of Moellem origin?\n7. Are the angia, kurti, pyjamahs much in use?\n\n\u00b9 In Kabul the custom is for boys and girls from 5 to 12 years of age to attend the same school.\n\u00b2 In Kabul many of the females are better acquainted with religious books than the males.\n8. At what age are females considered old women? Do females become really old at thirty? What is their influence and conduct then?\n\n9. Are Musulman females less luxurious and extravagant than Hindu ones?\n\n10. What are the recreations of females? Is kite flying such?\n\n11. Are Hindu and Musulman females fond of embroidering and of flowers?\n\n12. Are quarrels numerous among females? Are they very jealous?\n\n13. How far do females win and retain their husband's affections?\n\n14. What is the average time men remain widowers?\n\n15. How far practically is a system of austerity carried out with regard to widows? What means of support have they generally?\n\n16. If a woman washes off paint from her forehead, is it considered a sign of her wishing her husband's death?\n\n17. What has been the success of the working of the act for the remarriage of Hindu widows as to numbers and respectability?\n\n18. How far do women rule their husbands at home? Many Hindu gentlemen \"henpecked?\"\n\nXX.\n\nFestivals.\n\nFestivals for religious or commemorative purposes have always exercised great influence on social life, whether we look to the national games and assemblages of ancient Greeks, to those of the middle ages in Europe, or to those of recent times in England and France. Who can forget Washington Irving's vivid picture of Christmas and merry England in the olden time? But among the Hindus they have been pre-eminently influential as being interwoven so closely into the religion of the country. All the mighty minds of India in former days saw what a great effect they produced on all classes: hence Vaishnabs and Saktas alike, though differing in other points widely, have agreed in patronising them.\n\n1. The classes of society that do not attend festivals now, but did once\u2014why have they discontinued?\n\n2. The influence of festivals on the family relation, particularly on women and children?\n\n3. Any change and improvements in the mode of conducting festivals?\n4. How far are festivals become more occasions of trade or amusement than formerly?\n5. What festivals have become more popular than others\u2014the causes?\n6.

Are festivals good times for holding religious discussions, such as are practised by missionaries?\n9. The moral and social influence of festivals in bringing the male and female sexes more together?\n10. The various customs, ceremonies, connected with the first day of new year?\n11. How far festivals, such as the Holi, contribute to idleness and dissipation?\n12. Any observance like April fool or the Maypole in the Holi?\n13. Mention Obsolete festivals, and new ones, such as the Jagadatri?\n14. Baroari puja, how far observed now, and by whom; its origin? Ditto the Nag panchami in Bengal.\n15. An accurate description of the Hindu fasts and the festivals in the district? of their origin, the significance of their peculiar ceremonies, how observed by different castes?\n16. Ditto of the Musulman.\n17. Sunday, how spent by different classes of natives? Is it a day of pleasure?\n18. On Makar Sankranti, til seeds are eaten after dinner, and the sun is the only deity worshipped\u2014why?\n19. Is the Holi a kind of All Fool's day?\n20. Describe the following practices\u2014On Gadi pada, nim leaves are chewed, and puja paid to an Almanac; on the Ram Nabami a recitation of Ramayun. Narujal Purnima, cocoa nuts are thrown into the sea. On the Dewdli worship is paid to books.\n21. What festivals are observed by particular castes or by women only?\n\nXXI.\n\nFISHERMEN AND BOATMEN.\n\n1. What boats are not in build of indigenous origin?\n2. The castes that almost exclusively furnish boatmen,\u2014why chiefly from Chittagong or Furridpore?\n3. The morals of boatmen when separated from their families?\n4. In what respects are boatmen equal in skill to sailors?\n5. The peculiarities of the boatmen's language; is it the same as the Musulman-Bengali; a collection of the songs they sing when rowing?\n\n6. Why few Hindus are boatmen?\n\n7. The number of boatmen in Calcutta, are they on the increase or decrease? the causes?\n\n8. Sailors, how victimised on landing, in punch-houses, and by crimps?\n\n9. The various classes of fishermen, their profits now and formerly?\n\nXXII.\n\nFood.\n\nThe nature of food has much to do with bodily and mental vigour, although different nations in this point have their respective tastes; a Frenchman will eat a rat or a frog or horseflesh with a gout, that will make an Englishman almost vomit. The Englishman in like manner dislikes the oceans of ghi and quantities of high seasoning that enter into a Bengali's cuisine, while on the other hand the Bengali shudders at a calf being an object of mastication.\n\n1. The different kinds of curries, their use, expense of preparation, and how far their high seasoning is conducive to health?\n\n2. How far does the diet of Hindus preserve from certain diseases, but promote others?\n\n3. The effect of a vegetable diet on certain mental qualities; such as courage?\n\n4. Tea drinking, how far is it becoming popular?\n\n5. Why was a fish diet allowed to Bengal, but prohibited to up-country Brahmans?\n\n6. Is adulteration of food common? illustrations of it with its evils.\n\n7. Illustrate the following statement: \"the fare on which a Sonthal, a Cole, and a Garrow, will thrive, is utterly unsuited to the Bengali, the Assamese, and the Mugh.\"\n\nXXIII.\n\nHouses.\n\nThe dwellings of the poor and of the working classes have occupied much of the attention of philanthropists in England,\nand ought to do so in India, where floors, walls, windows, are closely connected with questions of health and decency.\n\n1. How far are the present native houses so built as to conduce to indecency, vice, quarrels, drunkenness, filth, bad ventilation?\u00b9\n2. Is the boitakhana of Hindu origin?\u00b2\n3. How far is the use of chairs preferable to the Asan or seat?\n4. How can the following defects in tiled houses be remedied: exposure to wind and rain, cold in winter, hot in summer?\n5. Mud huts, means to secure them against snake holes?\n6. Is not the building of suburban houses for workmen in large towns desirable?\n7. Is the northern side of a house invariably the Thakur khana?\n\nXXIV.\n\nKeranis or Native Clerks.\n\nThe Kerani system is so much the child of English trade and government as to demand special attention. One thing is clear, that as certain as English education has been limited almost exclusively in Bengal to the caste of Brahmans and Khaistas, so have the chief occupations of its alumni been those of keranis or copyists\u2014an effectual way in many cases to turn an educated youth into a mere machine, and to render him simply an imitator or copyer\u2014as he is a copyist. It is true in Northern India, from Katamandu to Mhow, the Bengali is the Englishman\u2019s right hand\u2014in what?\u2014is it not too often as a machine for copying, as a sort of looking glass to reflect his views without having any views of his own. A writer on Indian history remarks on the kerani in his work: \u201cThe eye seemed to communicate directly with the hand: there was no intervention of the brain. The intelligence of\n\n\u00b9 I allude here to an evil felt in England and Russia as highly demoralising, viz., a single sleeping-room for parties of different sexes. The Santals, semi-civilized though they be, are in this respect ahead of Bengalis; boys and girls arrived at the age of puberty, have to sleep separately away from their parents in a particular part of the village.\n\u00b2 Hamilton Buchanan\u2019s Bengal and Bihar, vol. ii. p. 697, states, \u201cIts name is moslem and that a place of receiving company was introduced, when the example or command of these haughty conquerors rendered it necessary to secrete the women, this practice is not common in the South of India, where the manners of the Hindus are less altered; the sofa made of wood, the carpets, and quilts seem to have been introduced by the Muhammadana.\u201d\u2014See Kirdi Arjunya.\nthe well tutored boy was seldom carried into the practicalities of actual life,\" I trust this taint on the Bengali may soon cease. Happily the introduction of iron copying machines will reduce in many cases the demand for machines of flesh.\n\n1. The total number of keranis employed in the different offices in Calcutta; the average amount of their salaries?\n2. The occupation of keranis' leisure hours; how far does the business of their offices afford material for conversation in their leisure hours?\n3. Do keranis keep up reading habits\u2014if not, why?\n4. How far does their knowledge of English acquired at School decline in office?\n5. How far do keranis read the new class of books in Vernacular literature?\n6. Are keranis chiefly of the khaista caste or of the Brahman?\n7. Banians (native) their past and present influence over Europeans, their profits?\n\nXXV.\n\nLANGUAGE.\n\n1. What is the source of that part of the Vernacular language which is not of Sanskrit or Persian origin? Has it, like the languages of South India, an affinity with the Tartarian dialects spoken in Central Asia.\u00b9\n2. The dialectical varieties in the vernacular, how far are they divergencies of pronunciation and spelling, similar to those in the English and Italian dialects\u2014their extent and causes? Are they on the increase or decrease?\n3. How far is Urdu declining in certain parts of India, as a colloquial and written language? the causes?\n4. What influence is likely to be produced on the Bengali language by increased intercourse with Central India and the North West?\n5. What language is likely to supplant the Santal, is it the Bengali, Hindi, or Urdu? Ditto as regards the Asamee?\n6. What effect on the structure of the vernaculars is likely to be produced by English educated natives?\n7. What idioms in the vernacular language are most striking in contrast with those of the English and Urdu languages?\n8. The language used at Gour, had it a closer affinity to Hindi than to Bengali.\n\n\u00b9 Caldwell's Dravidian grammar affords many valuable hints on this subject.\n9. What old Vernacular MSS. exist among private families?\u00b9\n\n10. Is the Musulman-Bengali, used chiefly by persons who cannot read or write the Bengali, increasing as a dialect?\n\n11. The past and present influence of Persian in Bengal?\n\n12. The boundaries of the Bengali language in the Midnapur district bordering on Orissa and in Birbhum on the Hindi-speaking districts?\n\n13. The vernacular language, how far in its progress does it illustrate the varying features of national character, habits, pursuits, social and mental development?\u00b2\n\n14. Are the educated Bengalis so different from Italians, Poles, or Hungarians, as to have little patriotic feeling in favour of their native language?\n\n15. Words in the vernacular having affinities with any Tartar or aboriginal language?\n\n16. Illustrations of the language of Flowers as used by Musulmans and Hindus?\n\n17. A list of those vernacular words not derived from Sanskrit or Persian\u2014their probable origin?\n\n18. Names of places, persons, or things in the vernacular throwing any light on the origin and affinities of the native race?\n\n19. Cant language used by particular classes?\u00b3\n\nXXVI.\n\nLaw and Social State.\n\nThe laws of a people have a very important bearing on their social development; hence jurisprudence has well been defined, \"the law of humanity in society,\" and the subject from this point of view has been taken up by the Social Science Association.\n\n1. How far is the new Penal Code, as contrasted with the Regulations, likely to affect the social condition of the people and mould their character; and how far is the social condition of the people likely to modify the working of this Code?\n\n\u00b9 Research in other quarters ought to encourage it here: thus we find that the Pashtu, until lately considered a colloquial dialect, had, as Captain Raverty shows, MS. as early as 1417 A.D.\n\n\u00b2 Language has well been called a map of the manners and science of the people who speak it. Thus the term for a widow, Vidhava, showed that all widows were not burnt; so pati, a lord, the term for husband, indicated that he ruled.\n\n\u00b3 Colonel Sleeman in his Ramaseeana gives the language of Thugs. We have in Bengal the language of boatmen.\n2. How far has the Panchayat or native jury system tended to raise the character of the people? how far is it popular? would the English Jury system be more efficient in this respect?\n\n3. The Income Tax, its probable bearings on the physical, social, and moral condition of the people?\n\n4. Menu's laws, how far did they influence the masses?\n\n5.

The effect on society of the Hindu law of intestate property.\n\n7. Which is more favorable to the creation of a middle class and the elevation of the masses, a seminary, a village, or a ryotwary system?\n\n8. How would a law of primogeniture be likely to work in India?\n\n9. Ditto a law like the French law of equal sub-division?\n\n10. In what respects is the social condition of the people different now from what it was in the Vedic age\u2014in Menu's\u2014in Ram's\u2014in Kalidasa's\u2014in the Musulman ditto?\n\n11. How far has law in India been the offspring, how far the parent of public opinion?\n\n12. The working of the Small Cause Courts in checking or increasing a love for litigation and in promoting a regard to truth in dealings?\n\n13. How far have native Educational endowments made the Pandits indolent by making them independent of their Scholars?\n\n14. The value of village Municipal Institutions in preparing a people for self-government? the remains of the old system in different parts of India?\n\n15. The importance to India of English lawyers in India having a training not only in law books, but also in a knowledge of the social condition of the people?\n\nXXVII.\n\nMARRIAGES.\n\n1. Illustrations of the effects of early marriage physically, mentally, socially?\n\n2. The causes and consequences of the expense of marriage ceremonies?\n\n3. How far do marriage ceremonies vary according to caste, social position, etc.?\nSOCIAL CONDITION OF THE NATIVES OF BENGAL.\n\n4. What practices in the marriage ceremonies as to length, expense, rites, ought to be discountenanced, what to be continued?\n5. Does early marriage in India tend to check vice?\n6. Is there a marriage in practice among the Hindus corresponding to the Muhammadan nikka?\n7. How far do marriages take place at a later period among educated natives\u2014the effects?\n8. Are Ghataks (Go betweens) many, their fees,\u2014any ghatak registries extant from Bullal Sen's time, or three centuries ago?\n9.

The different modes of calculating time, such as by sand, water, the sun, the stars?\n2. Is the Panchayat much practised now? was it ever in Bengal as much a part of the village system as in Central India?\n3. The practicability and advantage of Mofussil Savings and Loan Banks for the middle classes in the Mofussil, to promote provident habits and to rescue the Rayats from the Mahajans?\n4. Is the cycle theory for nations, of weakness, vigour, maturity, decay, inapplicable to India?\n5. The emigration to the Mauritius and W. Indies in its effects on the social condition of the emigrants and their families; on the parties themselves on their return\u2014are many remittances from emigrants made to their families?\n6. To what type of the European character are the Bengalis likely to approximate\u2014to the English or German, French or Italian?\n7. Are not mere English institutions as little adapted for India as they would be for France?\n8. Oriental Epistles, their various ornaments, superscriptions and envelopes?\n9. Have cases been known in modern times of the following punishments being enforced\u2014cutting off a Hindu's tika (top knot), putting lime on one side of his face and ink on the other side, and leading him about on an ass?\n\n1 In Birmingham in 1856, 84,000 accounts were opened for one penny and upwards; \u00a34,600 being paid in. Through Dr. Chalmers' influence penny banks were established, fifty years ago in Scotland. Dr. Duncan established in Scotland Savings Banks for deposits of a shilling and upwards, and thirty-two millions sterling have been deposited by 1,340,000 contributors.\n10. *Names*, any change desirable in *Hindu names*; the various modes of giving them? are all expressive? are they ever changed? how many different *names* are there of men and of women?\n\n11. *Salutations*, different modes of, any change in the form of in operation?\n\n12.

Why do Hindus *count and divide* by 4? does it relate to time, such as 4 weeks, 12 hours?\n\n22.

Does a *fixed price* for articles exist in any branch of Hindu trade?\n\n25. Is there much *competition* among Hindus? Is the \"cheap and nasty\" system much practised?\n\n26. Does population increase more in *town* or in the country?\n\n27. *Longevity*, how does it vary in different districts\u2014in various employments?\n\n28. Has a variety of *soils* any influence on the character of the people, as low and marshy coasts are said to furnish a sordid, degraded race?\n\n29. How far is there *real* tenderness to *animals* in India? Any places of refuge for lost or starving ones, or old ones?\n\n30. Is *suicide* common in India? among what classes? the kinds? causes? on the increase?\n\n\u00b9 When I was in England 18 years ago, the late Professor Wilson directed my attention to this subject as one of great interest; only a native can write on it.\n31. Different kinds of ordeal now among the Hindus, the balance, fire, water, poison, chewing rice, boiling oil, red hot iron?\u00b9\n\n32. Twelve instances of English misunderstanding of native practices, ditto of natives mistaking English.\n\n33. When were the natives first called niggers?\n\n34.

Any Mahratta females settled in Bengal?\n\n37. The causes of the rise in prices in the district?\n\nXXIX.\n\nMusulmans.\n\nThe Musulmans live among the Hindus, but are not of them; they even now are in Europe objects of much interest to various nations, and in the middle ages they left in Europe undying memorials of their knowledge and progress in the arts and social life. The Musulmans in Bengal read Bengali, but speak a mixed dialect.\n\n1. In what localities are there Musulmans of Patan or Mogul descent?\n\n2.

To what extent have the Musulmans and Hindus mutually adopted each other's religious and social practices?\u00b2\n\n6.

Is not the following Hindu practice of Musulman origin\u2014\n\n\u00b9 The trial by ordeal has been handed down in India from ancient times; it was prevalent in Europe in the middle ages.\u2014See Asiatic Researches, Vol. I.\n\n\u00b2 In Purnea, Hindus contribute to the expense of the Mohurrum; while caste has throughout Bengal obtained a complete ascendancy over the Moslems.\nwriting with the reed instead of the style or iron pen? other instances?\n\n8. How far have the strictness of Hindu caste and the easy terms on which Musulmans received converts, contributed to Moslem proselytism?\n\n9. Is Muhammadanism on the increase? how has it gained so many converts from the ryot class?\n\n10. Are the following sects of Fakirs in lower Bengal, Benawas, Takyahdars, Jalalis, Madari?\n\n11.

How did Musulmans in former days persecute the Hindus\u2014by conferring office and landed property on converts only\u2014by rejecting Hindu evidence in Courts\u2014by bringing Hindu children up as proselytes?\n\n22. Are Saids numerous in Bengal? what estimation are they held in?\n\n23. In Musulman burial grounds, describe the various monuments erected, the state in which they are kept?\n\n24. In the marriage ceremonies are sitting in state\u2014carrying and applying tumeric\u2014measuring for wedding garments, kept up?\n25.

Is there as strict a regard to omens in travelling now as formerly?\n\n39. The effects still remaining of former Moslem rule in Bengali.\n\nXXX.\n\nThe Native Press.\n\nThis power, though young at present, is gradually rising to a giant's strength; and even Young Bengal is coming round to acknowledge it to be a power, if not for himself, at least for his wife and daughters, who, not requiring to be copyists, do not need to work up a certain amount of China Bazar English; the publication of half a million copies of Bengali works in Calcutta annually for sale cannot be without its effects. It is very desirable to procure manuscript literature, such as ballads, proverbs, songs, family traditions. Of what great value, in an historical point of view to the Rajputs, are the ballads of Chand?\n1. The circulation and profits of the following works: *Almanacs*, *Panchalis* or popular songs, tales.\n\n2. Past and present patrons of native literature?\n\n3. The use of *Vernacular Libraries* in making known new publications and creating a taste for reading?\n\n4. A list of the various libraries for natives established in the Mofussil, their origin, success or failure, and the causes? the classes using them, the kind of books most popular?\n\n5.

The practicability of procuring a volume of *Anecdotes of native social life* as drawn from their literature?\n\n14. It has been affirmed that last century the Bengalis had no moral books, how far was that true?\n\nXXXI.\n\n**Pandits.**\n\nPandits once occupied more important positions in social life than they do now. Many anecdotes are still afloat of the wonderful acquisition in Sanskrit lore made by the Tarkalankars and others of former days, of the lengthened period\n\n\u00b9 Ballad literature is not to be despised as an index of a popular mind, as Sir W. Scott has shown with regard to the Scotch, and Bp. Percy with respect to the English ballads. A queen of Denmark, ten centuries ago, had the Danish ballads published: they have lately been translated into English; they are chiefly written by women, and treat of history, and legends. The Guzerat Vernacular Society in its report for 1849 states that one of its great objects was the collecting and copying ancient MS. ballads and tales.\n\n\u00b2 It is calculated there may be two hundred shops for the sale of these; now Brahmanas and Khaistas come into the field as book agents.\nof their grammatical studies, their profound acquaintance with the shastras, and their wonderful feats of memory. Their influence and emoluments are on the decay; the endowments they formerly had, which enabled them to maintain pupils according to the Hindu rule, that the master is to support the scholar, have been in many cases alienated. English education also has called for a more practical and paying knowledge than Sanskrit, though the latter is of the utmost value for philological and antiquarian purposes.\n\nRaja Krishna Chundra Roy of Nuddea was the Mecenas of Pandits last century, and bestowed on them an immense amount of land. Adams, in his reports on education, has given us much information on the position of Pandits in 1835, so has Buchanan Hamilton on those of Behar at the beginning of this century. Though pandit learning is on the wane, still it is to be wished that Sanskrit studies were placed in this country on a proper basis\u2014as a key to the chief Indian vernaculars\u2014as a capital training in Philology\u2014and as a means of throwing a flood of light on the origin of nations: how striking the fact, brought to light by Sanskrit, that the Highlanders of Scotland, the priests of Russia, and the Brahmins of Benares, use radically the same language!\n\n1. Pandits\u2014illustrations of their abstruse studies, deep knowledge as well as extensive reading on subjects now little studied?\n2. The emoluments, fees, and endowments of tols (colleges), and their influence over the pupils in various localities?\n3. The various causes that have led to the decline of the emoluments, influence, and studies of Pandits?\n4. Were Mithila brahmans numerous and influential in Bengal?\n5. Do Pandits, Purohits, or Gurus gain more emoluments, or have greater influence?\n\nXXXII.\n\nProverbs.\n\nProverbs present a rich field in illustrating the social condition of the people, as is pointed out in Trench's admirable work on the Proverbs.\n\n1. The origin of Vernacular Proverbs, how many are modern, how many from the Sanskrit?\n2. The extent to which they are used, which are local?\n3. Their contrast and similarity with Hindi, Urdu, Mahratta, Telugu?\n4. Their resemblance to European Proverbs?\n5. Proverbs illustrating the moral and social condition of the people.\n6. Proverbs throwing any light on the history of the country?\n\nXXXIII.\n\nReaders.\n\nIn oriental countries where the masses cannot read, it is very common for the people to assemble to hear one read a book to them, and explain its more difficult passages; illustrations can be seen in the Arabian Nights. Among the Bengali this class of Readers or Reciters is called a Kathak.\n\n1. The Kathaks; their number, mode of being trained, emoluments and chief localities; are they on the increase or decrease?\n2. How far could the system be adopted of employing men like Kathaks to read interesting works?\n3. Vernacular lectures on popular subjects illustrated with diagrams, pictures, the desirableness and practicability of having them?\n\nXXXIV.\n\nRecreations\u2014Music.\n\nMusic, since the days of Orpheus, as well as before, has exercised a mighty spell on the popular mind: we know the famous saying \"Give me the making the ballads of a nation, and I will give you the making its laws.\" Sir W. Jones has written well on Hindu music and has vindicated its claims, though Europeans and Asiatics will never agree on this point.\n\nThere is a Bengali work on this, but I have met very few pandits that could explain it.\n\n1. The popular songs in use, their description, number and influence?\n2. An account of the most popular ballad writers?\n3. Any English music likely to be popular in this country?\nSOCIAL CONDITION OF THE NATIVES OF BENGAL.\n\n4. Any men corresponding with the Bhats of Rajputana or the wandering minstrels of Europe in the middle ages?\u00b9\n5. The numbers, profits of musicians who play for hire, their different classes?\n6. Are athletic exercises as much practised now as formerly?\n7. How far do Bengalis sleep more than Englishmen?\u00b2\n8. What English games or athletic exercises might be naturalised in India?\n9. The advantage of having a half holiday on Saturday?\n10. Field sports, as fowling, fishing, riding, pigeon fancying, kite flying, how far practised?\n11. Gambling, various kinds of\u2014numbers of gamblers\u2014gains\u2014gambling houses?\n12. The mode of spending the evenings among educated natives? much discussion on politics or religion?\n13. Are feats of skill, such as balancing a row of water-pots on the head, dancing on poles, balancing, tumbling, rope-dancing, sleight of hand, common?\n14. Native musical instruments, the various ones, by what classes used? the ones most popular?\n15. Analysis of Vernacular books on music?\n16. Cock fighting, bulbul fighting, ram fighting, how far practised?\n17. The Hindu notation of music? any music on European notation; any counterpoint, describe the various ragas; any harp?\n18. Listening to tales, and riddles of an evening, how far practised?\n19. Various modes of swimming practised, can any women swim?\n\nXXXV.\n\nSECTS.\n\nWithout trenching on theological controversy, there is a wide field in considering the social influence of the various sects of Hindus and Musulmans. Professor Wilson has almost exhausted the theological part of the question in his elaborate work on the \"Sects of the Hindus,\" but there is much to fill up in the social part.\n\n\u00b9 In Behar silla those Bhats rank next to the military tribes, amount to 380 families, most of which have endowments in land. \"They are very impudent fellows, and when any one offends them, they make an image of cloth, and call it by their enemy's prototype.\"\n\u00b2 I mention this as the Bengalis sit up late.\n1. How far are the Vaishnabs ahead of other sects in elevating the people or women, or in proselyting? have they made any proselytes among Muhammadans? their ceremonies for the initiation of converts?\n\n2. The extent of the Guru's power and emoluments now? do they travel far? the greatest number of disciples any have? their visits, instruction, morals? the various kinds of Upadesh they whisper into the ear?\n\n3. The duties, influence and punishment of the Dalpati?\n\n4. Is this remark of Wilson correct: \"In Bengal the Lingum worship has no hold on the people's affections, it is not interwoven with their amusements, nor must it be imagined that it offers any stimulus to impure passions.\" Lecture I. 22.\n\n5. The Saktas, their mystical diagrams, rites, and gesticulations?\n\n6. Lingamites, are their priests Jangams? are any Sudras?\n\n7. Was Sati practised more among Saktas or Vaishnabes?\n\n8. Who worship Ola Bibi (the goddess of cholera), when did it begin, and in what districts is it observed? ditto of Shitola, of the Karta Bhojas, of Dakin Ray, of Gazi?\n\n9. What sects originating in the Upper Provinces have followers in Bengal, and what Bengali sects have adherents in the Upper Provinces?\n\n10. Is the Tantric system spreading? its social influence?\n\n11. The three leading divisions of Hindu monks? how far do they observe caste?\n\n12. Among what sects is Pantheism spreading\u2014is it spiritual or material pantheism?\n\n13. The resemblances and differences between Pantheism and Sufyism?\n\n14. The number of sects among the Musulmans? their respective social influences?\n\nXXXVI.\n\nServants.\n\n1. Do natives keep the same number of servants as Europeans in a corresponding rank of life? how do their pay, treatment, work, differ in the service of Europeans, East Indians, Hindus, and Musulmans?\n\n2. The state of slaves in former days\u2014their price and treatment?\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Slavery was once very prevalent in Bengal, and especially in Behar; the Musulmans in the latter place, forbidden by their religion to purchase a freeman, in order to give a sop to their conscience, call it taking a lease of a man for ninety years.\nSOCIAL CONDITION OF THE NATIVES OF BENGAL.\n\n3. The causes that servants in Calcutta and other parts in India are said to be inferior to what they used to be\u2014is it that those who govern ill are served ill?\n\n4. How far is the practice of exchanging certificates of character carried?\n\n5. Chuddars (macemen) their numbers and pay in former days? when did their numbers become less?\n\n6. Anecdotes, illustrative of the number, treatment, and cost of slaves in Bengal in former times.\n\n7. How far are the rules of caste among servants really such? how far are they an invention for their own ease and profit? (In Madras, the land of real caste, one servant does the work of many).\n\n8. Ayahs, their castes, emoluments, morals?\n\n9. The moral and social effect of so many servants being separated from their wives and families? is it like the Scotch boothy system?\n\nXXXVII.\n\nTRAVELLING.\n\nThough pilgrimages may have conduced to encourage the Hindus to a love of adventure and to season them to hardship, still there is among Bengalis a strong clinging to their native place and their bh\u0101ilok, and yet Bengalis are found like Jews everywhere in India, but with better effect now than what Hamilton records \u201cof the Calcutta Babus sent to Dinagepore, which is invaded by strangers from Calcutta, most of them rapacious as kites, and eager to accumulate fortunes in order to be able to retire to their native country.\u201d We trust that one of the effects of the railroad will be to lead a different kind of Bengalis to visit Behar, viz., the educated native who wishes to see the remains of the former greatness of his country, as seen in the Buddhist ruins of Behar, the Hindu monuments of Benares, the Moslem grandeur of Agra and Delhi, the beauteous scenery in the valley of the Soane and the Jain buildings of Rajputana, with the wide Champaign of Rewa\u2014we hope this Indian grand tour may be considered necessary to crown a book education.\n\n1 From Katamandu to Indore, the Bengali Babu is the copying machine in offices; in Benares alone there are about 7000 Bengalis settled.\n1. Do the Bengalis travel more than the Behar men? is their love to it on the increase?\n2. Do pilgrimages in Bengal contribute more to a travelling spirit than in the Agra Presidency?\n3. Is much correspondence kept up between Bengalis located in the Agra Presidency and their friends in Bengal?\n4. How far is cheap postage leading the lower classes to a desire to learn to write and read.\n5. Different kinds of lodging houses for travellers, their various prices\u2014accommodation\u2014are they over crowded\u2014do scenes of vice or robbery often occur?\n6.

News, the various modes of procuring and publishing?\n8. Planting trees by the road sides, how far practised in ancient and modern times?\n9. The causes leading to natives emigrating to the Mauritius and other parts?\n\nXXXVIII.\n\nVEHICLES.\n\n1. The various changes in shape the palankee has undergone.\u00b9\n2. How far is it feasible to introduce into lower Bengal the use of the ekka, which is both cheap and expeditious?\n3.

Syces in Calcutta ditto ditto\u2014were not syces formerly more swift of foot?\u00b3\n5. The origin of the shape of the present kiranchis. Is it taken from old English coaches?\n\nXXXIX.\n\nWORKING CLASSES.\n\nIn England, much interest has been taken in the working classes, as the great pillars of the social system.\n\nIn India in the present state of things, the working classes\n\n\u00b9 Last century they were arched.\n\u00b2 In Berlin, the cab drivers, while waiting for a fare, are to be often seen reading.\n\u00b3 The author of Seri Mutakherim writes that they make nothing of following and preceding Englishmen on a full gallop, and that common servants have been seen who would run down a hare.\nafford a fine field for education and social improvement, as their improved social condition, the rise of wages, and their wants lead them to feel a stronger desire for education and its accompaniments; to them a knowledge of reading, writing, and arithmetic, is rendered by their daily occupations a matter of necessity, while a little colloquial English would in some cases be of use to them. What they especially need is not a smattering of book English, but a sound vernacular education, embracing the elements of mathematics and manufacturing skill, on the plan of the commercial schools in England, from which, a smattering of Latin has been excluded. How many eminent men have risen from this class, such as Stephenson and Hugh Miller, an encouragement to others; like as in the French army, every soldier is said to carry the baton of field marshall in his knapsack, or in Russia where several millionaires were originally serfs. In Jehanabad a century ago a Musulman tailor founded a sect composed of Musulmans and Hindus, who respect the Koran and Shastras; this tailor composed 18 sacred books in Hindi, and his followers now amount to 20,000. Kabir, sprung from a weaver family, was the founder of one of the greatest sects in north India, while among the village gods worshipped in Behar are those who were boatmen, domes, oilmen. Chandra Gupta\u2019s maternal grandfather was a barber.\n\nThe London Working Men\u2019s College, established in 1854, has 270 students in Mathematics, Drawing, French, Natural History; there are other Colleges in Manchester, Halifax, having among their alumni, carpenters, shoe-makers, weavers, tailors, porters. When will Bengal have hers\u2014the working men now can scarcely read. When is India to have the literature of labour\u2014like that of Burns the bard and ploughman\u2014Clare the peasant poet\u2014Hogg the shepherd poet\u2014Cooper the shoemaker poet\u2014Miller the stonemason geologist. Hood\u2019s literature of labour and the achievements of mind among the cottage, or \u201cmind among the spindles\u201d suggest many reflections on this.\n\n1. Weavers, their numbers, profits, social position, localities; do many read; have many risen in the world?\n2. Tailors, are all Musulmans?\n3.

IV.\u2014Short Account of the Malay Manuscripts belonging to the Royal Asiatic Society. By H. N. van der Tuuk.\n\n[Presented July 3, 1865].\n\nA.\u2014RAFFLES COLLECTION.\n\nNo 1 (large folio of 460 pages) contains the \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0647\u062c\u062a \u062a\u0631\u0648\u0647. About the hero see Malayan Annals, translated by Leyden, Chapters xiv. and xvi. A small extract is found in Crawfurd's \"History of the Indian Archipelago,\" ii. p. 51. Manuscripts of this work, the text of which might be available, are in the possession of Mr. J. Pijnappel, at Leyden; and of Mr. E. Netscher, at Riyow. The last chapters of this tale are found in No. 2607 of the manuscripts of the India Office, commencing with that part where the king of M\u00e1laka intends to make one of his sons king on Mount Siguntang.\n\nThis composition is very interesting, as it exhibits a faithful picture of Malay life, and is written in genuine Malay.\n\nNo. 2 (large folio of 288 pages; the last four pages are filled up with doggrel rhymes by some transcriber). This manuscript appears to be a transcript made by a native of Java, for a great many words belonging to the Malay dialect of Java occur in it; as, for instance, uribang, flower of the\n\n---\n\n1 I shall make mention of other copies, as it is my opinion that no Malay composition ought to be published without a supply of manuscripts bearing on the same subject. Texts from one manuscript, such as those published by Mr. J. J. de Hollander, in Holland, are not to be depended upon. Even quotations, found somewhere, I shall take notice of, as it may be useful to the editor of a Malay text to consult them.\n\n2 See No. 68 of my Kort Verslag der Maleische Handschriften in het East India House, London, where the reader will find a full account of those closing chapters. As the numbers in that account have been since changed, I shall give here the present numbers.\nhibiscus rosa Sinensis; b\u00f2p\u00e8ng, pock-marked; kul\u00f2n, west, etc. It also abounds with Javanese titles, as d\u00e8mang, ngab\u00e9hi, kandur\u00fawan, etc. The manuscript is in many passages too corrupt to be of use in editing the text. The transcriber has often changed words he did not understand into such as resembled them in sound, or nearly so. But what is very strange, it has now and then a form less corrupted than the Javanese; v.g. nantab\u00f3ga (p. 188) instead of the Javanese antaboga (a corruption of the Kawi anantabhoga). As to the contents, it follows the Javanese poem only to a certain extent, whilst it often contains passages which are not explicable otherwise than by supposing that a Javanese original has been translated or imitated, which did not deviate so much from the original Kawi poem, as the one published by Mr. A. B. Cohen Stuart. Although it is evidently taken from the Javanese, its first and last pages contain matter not found either in the Kawi or Javanese work, whilst no trace is found of the introduction, wherein the king Jaya B\u00e1ya, in whose reign Mpu S\u00e9dah, the Javanese author, lived, is spoken of in laudatory terms; moreover, the title B\u00e1rata yuda (Bh\u00e1rata-yuddha) which is given to the Javanese version, is not known in Malay; and the great war between the Korawas and P\u00e1ndawas, wherever it is alluded to in Malay compositions, is always called p\u00e1rang Pand\u00e1wa Jaya, \u201cthe war of the victorious P\u00e1ndawa.\u201d Not until p. 134 do the contents of this manuscript resemble the Kawi and Javanese composition. The Malay author says in the opening that his work, although containing the story of the Pandawa Pancha Kalima, gives a great many beautiful tales in the beginning, and afterwards the tale named Hikayat Pandawa Jaya. These beautiful tales are, he says, a collection of Javanese dramatic compositions (l\u00e1lakon), to which he gives no particular names. I shall, on another occasion, make an analysis of the whole\n\n1 Even Dutch words, as, for instance, \u0628\u0644\u0648\u0631 (blaauw, blue), occur in it. (See p. 115).\n2 So, for instance, we find passim \u0643\u0631\u0645\u0647\u0645 (Ar.) instead of \u0643\u0631\u0645 (alms, largesse of a king to priests and religious mendicants).\n3 Translation of pancha.\nand divide it into three parts. The first will give a rapid view of the contents from page 1\u2013134, being what is not found either in the Kawi or Javanese work. The second will be more circumstantial, as it may illustrate the difficult passages of the Kawi original, and will comprise what is found from p. 134\u2013208, being the record of the great war. The third will give only a brief account of the contents from p. 208 to the end, as it deviates in this part almost in every respect from the Javanese version,\u00b9 which closes with a eulogy of king Jaya Baya, of which no trace is found in this manuscript. The library of the India Office is possessed of two manuscripts bearing on the same subject, but only containing the description of the war. They are numbered 2384 (small 4to. 234 pages), and 2605 (8vo. 176 pages). Both commence with introducing to the reader the chief heroes who figure in it, and then speak of K\u0101\u015bna\u2019s\u00b2 mission to demand the half of the kingdom in behalf of the five sons of Pandu.\u00b3 To enable the reader to form a judgment of the difference of the texts of the three manuscripts, some specimens are here given.\n\nThe names of the four holy men (r\u0113\u1e63i) that join K\u0101\u015bna when setting out for Hastinapura as mediator are in No. 2603: \u062c\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0633\u0652 , \u0646\u064e\u0632\u064e\u062f\u0652 , \u0631\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u0641\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0648\u0652 ; in No. 2384, \u0631\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u0641\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0648\u0652 , \u062c\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0633\u0652 , \u0646\u064e\u0632\u064e\u062f\u0652 ; and in this manuscript, \u0643\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0652 , \u062c\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0633\u0652 , \u0646\u064e\u0632\u064e\u062f\u0652 , \u0631\u064e\u0645\u0652 \u0641\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0648\u0652 .\u2074\n\nThe passage where the Javanese version speaks of a human sacrifice being performed by either of the contending parties runs in No. 2384 as follows:\n\n\u0633\u062a\u0644\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0633\u06cc\u062e \u062f\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0641\u0644 \u06f2 \u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u06a9 \u0645\u0627\u0633\u062e \u06f3 \u0645\u0645\u0644\u0646\u062a\u0633 \u06a9\u0648\u062a \u06a9\u0631\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u06cc\u062a\n\u0628\u0631\u0647\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u06a9\u062a\u0631\u0627 \u0646\u0645\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0645\u063a\u0627\u0644\u0633 \u06a9\u0648\u062a \u0641\u0646\u062f\u0648 \u0627\u06cc\u062a \u0627\u0646\u0642 \u0633\u06cc\u062e \u0632\u0646\u062c\u0648\u0646\n\n\u00b9 Of the Kawi version only twelve copies (!) have been lithographed by order of the Dutch government. It is not complete, ending with the combat of Arjuna and Bh\u016bta\u015b\u0101ma.\n\u00b2 K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\n\u00b3 Leyden (As. Res. x. 178) mentions the following separate tales about the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas: 1st. The tale about their gambling; 2nd, that about their borrowing a hall; 3rd, that about their selling time.\n\u2074 In the Kawi poem they are Para\u015bur\u0101ma, K\u0101\u015bva, Janaka, and N\u0101rada (the Javanese has the same, only differently spelt, according to the Javanese pronunciation).\nNo. 2603 has:\n\nThis manuscript has (p. 147):\n\nThe Kawi (x. 6) has: tuwin pada tlas makaryya bhisuweng\u00b9 tgal paprangan | rawan ngaran i hang tawur nr\u00e9pati pandawa muruwani | kunang tawur i sang nr\u00e9peng kuru ya k\u00e1rilud brahma\u1e47a | rikan sira \u015bin\u0101pa sang dwija sagotra m\u0101ty\u0101laga.\n\n\"Then they all performed a sacrifice on the field of battle, Rawan was the name of the victim of the Pandawa king, commencing; as to the victim of the Kuru king, a brahma\u1e47a was . . . . . , thence he was cursed by the twice born, to die with his [whole] family in fighting.\" This remarkable passage will perhaps attract the attention of some\n\n\u00b9 Instead of bhisuwua (bhisuwong is bhisuwa + ing) a manuscript on palm leaves in my possession has bhisu-eng (bhisu + ing). I should like to read here bhisuwa (abhigaua). The Malay text gives no explanation, as it is evidently influenced by the Javanese version, where sagotra has become the name of a person. Moreover it identifies Rawan with a son of Arjuna (of the name of Irwan), who is afterwards killed by a demon (xii. 17). The word m\u0101malis in the Malay version is probably a substantive made from m\u0101malis, which occurs in the Hikayat Kumala bahrin with the sense of to turn off the evil influence of a ghost from a person who is supposed to have been visited by a ghost, and in consequence of it has got some disease (compare the Ngaju-Dayak palis). m\u0101malis must then have the meaning of what is used to turn off the evil influence of ghosts.\nSanskrit scholar, who may succeed in explaining it. In No. 21 (see below) I have not been able to find it.\n\nNo. 3 (large folio of 244 pages, imperfect at the end) contains the tales, containing the adventures of Inu Kartapati, prince of Kuripan. This manuscript commences with the king of Kuripan's getting a son, called on his birth Asmara ning rat Ondakan Jaya. Then the birth is related of Lasmining puri Chandra-kirana, the princess of Daha, who was also named Puspaning rat, and betrothed to the above-named prince of Kuripan. This princess, when yet a girl, was carried off by Batara Kula, and placed with her attendants in a forest, where she changed her name and that of her waiting women. The prince of Kuripan goes, attended by his followers, in quest of his intended bride, and in his rambles for that purpose takes the name of Ranga Ariya Kuda Nastapa, his followers too changing each his name.\n\nNo. 4 (folio of 246 pages and ending abruptly) and No. 73 (small 4to. of 420 pages) both contain the imitation of the Persian. On comparing the introduction, where the owner of the parrot (\u062e\u0648\u0627\u062c\u06c1 \u0633\u06cc\u0645\u0648\u0631\u0646) is spoken of, I found the readings to be nearly the same. In my possession is a copy (folio of 90 pages) wherein the parrot tells thirteen tales. In the library of the India Office there are two manuscripts of this composition (Nos. 2604 and 2606). The former contains twenty-two tales, but the latter only ten, whilst the introduction about Khojah Meymun is wanting in it. According to Abdu-llah the Moonshee this composition also goes by the name of \u062e\u0648\u0627\u062c\u06c1 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u0633\u06cc\u0645\u0648\u0631\u0646 after the parrot's owner. The two manuscripts of the India Office seem to belong to one and the same version, and only differ in the proper names, which have been changed to Malay ones in No. 2606. The versions in both differ from my manuscript.\n\nNo. 5 (folio of 315 pages) contains the\n\n1 Compare under No. 14.\n2 See further Kort Verslag der Maleische Handschriften van het E. I. House.\n3 See his Journal, p. 95 of the Singapore edition. Of this Journal there is also a reprint in the fourth volume of Meursinge's Maleisch Leesboek; and a French translation by Dulaurier.\nIt is an imitation in prose of the Javanese poem, the commencement of which has been published by Mr. J. J. de Hollander in the Reader, p. 158 sqq. at the end of his Hand-leiding bij de Beoefening der Javaansche Taal- en Letter-kunde (Breda, 1848). A translation, as it would seem, of the Javanese poem is to be found in Roorda van Eysinga's Indi\u00eb (Breda, 1843), p. 502 (3de boek, eerste deel.). No. 11 (folio of 151 pages, only written half way down, the open spaces being perhaps intended for a translation) contains the same tale, but considerably abridged.\n\nNo. 6. See No. 31.\n\nNo. 7 (folio) contains:\n\nI. (71 pages) \u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0628\u064a\u062f\u0633\u0627\u0631. This poem has been edited with a Dutch translation and annotations by Mr. R. van Ho\u00ebvell, in vol. xix. of the Transactions of the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences, but may be had separately. A review of this edition is to be found in the Indisch Magazijn & Gids (1847), and quotations from another manuscript in Roorda van Eysinga's Maleisch-Nederduitsch Woordenboek, under \u0628\u0631\u0643\u0649, \u0633\u0646\u062f\u064a\u0631, \u0633\u0646\u062f\u0631, \u0631\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0646, \u062f\u0634\u0631, \u062f\u0627\u0641\u062a, \u062c\u0645\u062c\u0645 and \u0633\u0646\u0647\u0645. Another copy is contained in No. 36 (folio of 130 pages, and ending abruptly). Both manuscripts may serve to correct the edited text. I subjoin here a specimen of the various readings:\n\nThe printed edition, page 3, line 9 from below, has:\n\nSat\u016blah (baginda sampey)\\(^1\\) kapantey | di lihatra p\u0101rahu (di atas lantey)\\(^2\\) || langkap (lah sakaliyan)\\(^3\\) kajang dan lantey | (b\u0101ik)\\(^4\\) lah put\u0101ri duduk b\u0101rijuntey ||\n\nPage 5, line 5 from above:\n\nTidurlah anakku bulang hulu | biyarlah ayahnda b\u0101rijalan d\u0101hulu || (anakku pandang)\\(^5\\) hatiku pilu | bagey di hiris d\u0101ngan sambilu ||\n\nPage 6, line 4:\n\nSambilan bulan sambilan hari | (ku kandung)\\(^6\\) di dalam (hutan dur)\\(^7\\) ||\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) No. 7 has sampey baginda, and No. 36, sampey tuwan turun.\n\n\\(^2\\) No. 36, t\u0101rlalu b\u0101sey.\n\n\\(^3\\) No. 36, dan.\n\n\\(^4\\) Nos. 7 and 36, ndi\u0113k.\n\n\\(^5\\) No. 7, anak kupandang.\n\n\\(^6\\) No. 7, kukandung.\n\n\\(^7\\) No. 7, diri.\nPage 6, line 2 from below:\n\nB\u0101rjalan lah baginda (laju manulik)\u00b9 | rasa\u00f1a h\u0101ndak (b\u0101r-balik)\u00b2 k\u0101mbali ||\n\nII. (69 pages) \u0634\u0639\u0631\u0649 \u062a\u0645\u0648\u0647\u064a\u0646. This poem has been twice edited by J. J. de Hollander, once in the Reader of the first edition of his Handleiding bij de beoefening der Maleische Taal- en Letterkunde, and once separately (Leyden, 1856), from a transcript evidently made in Java, and badly mutilated. The version of this manuscript has hardly anything in common with that of the one edited, but corresponds in many respects with that recension of the poem, from which Marsden has given extracts in the Reader at the end of his Grammar.\n\nThe king mentioned in the opening is called here S\u0101ri nara ind\u0101ra di Ch\u0101mpaka Jajar, but in the one edited Ratu Socha windu pura nagara. As proper names of females, Kin T\u0101dahan and Kin Pangalipur occur here; whilst the name of the heroine is sometimes shortened into Kin Tabuk for the sake of rhyme and metre. Wira Dandani, Wira P\u0101ndapa and Wira K\u0101rta are found as proper names of males. The hero, the prince who fell in love with the heroine, goes here by the names of Puspa K\u0101nchana, Raden Inu,\u00b3 Anak Mant\u0101ri, Inu Bangsawan, Raden Inu K\u0101rtapati,\u2074 and Anak Inu. The beauty of the heroine is compared to that of Januwati,\u2075 the goddess of love (yangyang k\u0101suma), and the celestial nymph Nila-utama. Instead of taman (garden), this manuscript makes often use of the Kawi l\u0101langun.\u2076 Paduka Mah\u0101dewi, Paduka Matur (?), and Paduka Liku are mentioned as inferior wives of the old king.

In this version, the heroine is the daughter of a king, Wanggar, and the waiting-maid, who dies with her, is called here, as in the printed edition, Kin Bayan. One of her most beloved nurses has the name of Antardasi, and is addressed by her with kakak or the Javanese embok (elder sister). The principal attendants of the hero are Panta Wira Jaya or Jaran Angsoka. The place where the heroine is killed here the wood (Jav. alas) Puchangan. The lovers are brought to life by Batara Kala, who changes them into lotus flowers, and then veils them in a cloud of incense. The residence is called in the end Sochawindu, but elsewhere only Pura nagara. Mr. H. C. Millies, at Utrecht, has a manuscript of this version. It is not worth publishing, but may be available for a new edition of the poem, of which there is a manuscript also in the library of King\u2019s College if I recollect right. It is beyond all doubt, that the poem as well as the tale belong to the widely-spread cycle of the tales in which the adventures of Panji are related.\\(^3\\)\n\nIII.

This tale contains the adventures of Indara Putara, son of Bakarma Puspa,\u00b2 king of Samanta-pura, and is replete with wonderful narratives. The hero is carried off by a golden peacock; is sent by the king Shahsiyan to Barma Sagti; kills a giant or demon on Mount Indara Kila;\u00b3 finds the wonderful sea in the midst of the world (tasik samudara); meets with the princess Kumila Ratna Sari; contends with the prince Lela Mangarna in exhibiting supernatural feats; is carried off by a genie (of the name of \u062a\u0645\u0631\u062c\u0644\u0633), whose son (called \u062a\u0645\u0631\u062c\u0644\u0633) he kills; meets consecutively with mountains of gold and other precious metals, the seas of wonder and love; journeys in a cavern during a month; kills a serpent (of the name of \u0645\u0646\u062f\u0648\u062f), and a demon (called \u063a\u0648\u0631\u0642\u0627); meets with Darma Gangga, who instructs him in supernatural means of conquering his enemies, and with Barma Sagti, etc. At last our hero comes home, and is made king of Samanta-pura with the title of Sultan Indara Mangindara. No. 55 terminates with a great many erotic verses not found in the other copies. Many quotations from this work are to be found in Werndly's Maleische Spraakkunst (pp. 133, 157, 162, 170 (twice), 171, 174 (three times), 176, 185, 186, 191, 193, 194 and 195), in Roorda van Eysinga's Maleisch-Nederduitsch Woordenboek (under pantas, pandey, puji and gdrak), and in the annotations of Mr. van Ho\u00ebvell on the Sair Bidasari (pp. 289, 305, 333, 335, 348, 352, 375 and 399).

In the commencement of the tale there is a kind of summary, wherein the hero is said to be a great king, who visited Mount Qaf, China, and the land of the inferior gods (dewa), subjecting men and ghosts to his sovereignty. On p. 2 a state Samanda-puri is mentioned. Its king was called S\u0101riyawan, and was sprung from Indr\u0101 Dewa Mahar\u0101ma Rupa, whilst his queen was of mere mortal extraction. He had two sons called Raja Ard\u0101n and Raja Mars\u0101dan. The two princes went with a large retinue to the forest Samanta Baranta, where a dewa of the name Sar\u0101ma Dewa was in the habit of enjoying himself. This god hated the king, their father, who had caused his residence to be destroyed in former times. He changed himself into an old man and visited the princes, saying that he wished to serve them. Contriving to separate them from their followers when engaged in hunting, the god transformed himself into an elephant, whom Ard\u0101n so hotly pursued, that he got the start of his brother, and at last found himself entirely alone. The god then flew away with the prince to the sky, but was killed by the young hero. Ard\u0101n, having arrived again on this sublunary orb, made the acquaintance of a r\u0113si called B\u0101yu R\u0101ma, who told him that he was not to revisit his country for many years. The prince remained in the dwelling of the holy man, who instructed him in all sorts of supernatural sciences. Mars\u0101dan goes in quest of his brother, and in his rambles arrives at Ind\u0101rapura, where he marries the king\u2019s only daughter, and succeeds his father-in-law. Ard\u0101n has a great many adventures of the same kind, delivering a princess with her waiting women, etc. B\u0101rma Shahd\u0101n, the hero of the tale, is a son of Mars\u0101dan Sh\u0101h, king of Kalingga dewa, and his eldest brother is\n\n1 Called Bak\u0101rma Duli raja. The proper name Bak\u0101rma is very frequent in Malay tales, and is a corruption of the Sanskrit wikrama; it is often confounded with Pak\u0101rma.\n\n2 The manuscript has \u0643\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0643\u062a \u062f\u064a\u0648 (p. 32).\ncalled here R\u00e1judir\u00e1ja. This work is replete with pantuns, some of which are worthy of notice. The late Mr. P. P. Roorda van Eysinga possessed a manuscript (two volumes in folio), which he would have published, but for want of a sufficient number of subscribers: what has become of it I cannot say. J. J. de Hollander (Handleiding bij de Beoefening der Mal. Taal-en Letterkunde, 3d edition, p. 332) says, I know not on what authority, that the author was Sheikh Ibn Abu Omar.\n\nNo 13 is a number I could not find. Dulaurier has also omitted it in the list he gives (Journal Asiatique, 3rd series, x. 69) of titles of the manuscripts of this collection.\n\nNo. 14 (folio of 456 pages: on the back of the cover, Charang Kurina) contains the \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u062c\u0627\u0631\u063a \u0643\u0644\u064a\u0646. It is a tale belonging to the Panji cyclus. The commencement is about the king of Kuripan having two sons, the eldest being K\u00e1rta Buw\u00e1na, and the youngest Raden Asm\u00e1ra Jaya, surnamed Ondakan Rawis\u00e1rdangga, who was betrothed to the princess of Daha, called Raden Puspita-ning Rat.\u00b9 The name by which this tale goes is the assumed name of the princess when she had fled from her father's residence in order to follow the prince, in the garb of a man.\n\nNo.15 (small folio of 180 pages) contains the \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0647\u0631\u0627\u062c \u0628\u0648\u0645. The plot of this tale is nearly the same as that of the Bhaumakawya,\u00b2 relating the adventures of Boma (the Sanskrit Bhauma, son of the earth). He was the son of Bisnu (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u) by the goddess P\u00e1rtiwi (Sans. pr\u0113th\u012bvi, earth), and became a powerful king, whom even the gods stood in dread of. As he, demon-fashion, annoyed the penitents, K\u00e1sma (Kr\u0113\u015bna) sends his son Samba against him. Boma is at last killed by Hanoman, after having himself killed Samba and Arjuna, who were, however, called into life again by Nar\u00e1da (N\u0101rada) sent by Batara Guru for the purpose. The celebrated episode\u00b3 of D\u0101rmadewa and D\u0101rmadewi is here inserted in the same way as in the Kawi poem, D\u0101rmadewa following Bisnu when\n\n\u00b9 Compare under No. 3.\n\u00b2 Edited by Friederich in the Transactions of the Batavian Society.\n\u00b3 This episode is often alluded to in Malay tales and poems (comp. under No. 7, II.)\narnating himself into K\u0101sna and becoming Samba, whilst\nirmadewi, after having burnt herself, becomes Januwati,1\nd so is reunited to her former love. This tale is also\nmed \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0633\u062e \u0633\u0645\u0628. The R.A.S.'s MS. (see also under\n1. 21) slightly differs from the one in the India Office (No.\n05, 4to. 120 pages). Raffles (History of Java, i. p. 388, first\nition) mentions the Javanese version under the titles Buma\nilantaka and Embatali. The first name is no doubt\nhaumakalantaka (the death of the demon Bhauma, kala\ning used in Javanese to denote demons and Titans),\nmay be inferred from the Kawi poem p. 233, where it is\nhaumantaka (Bhauma's end, the hero dying by the hand of\n\u012b\u015bnu2). The Kawi version bears ap. Raffles l.l. the name\nnarakasura, which is to be corrected into Narakasura (the\nmon Naraka, another name of Bhauma). I shall give on\nother occasion an analysis of this Malay composition.\nNo. 16 (folio of 206 pages). A duplicate is No. 62, i.\n158 pages). The two manuscripts differ but slightly. They\ncontain the \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u064a\u062a\u064a\u0645. The work has been edited by Mr. P.\nRoorda van Eysinga (Batavia, 1821), who has also given an\nanalysis of it in the tenth volume of the Transactions of the\nBatavian Society. The episode of the singing peacocks has\nbeen published from another version by Meursinge in the\nthird volume of his Maleisch Leesboek. In the library of\nthe India Office there are two manuscripts, Nos. 2429 and\n2430 (?). Mr. J. Pijnappel has also a manuscript. A\nnew edition of this work is desirable, as that by Roorda van\nEysinga has long been out of print. Quotations from it are\nfound in Werndly's Maleische Spraakkunst, pp. 142, 157,\n170, 171, 172, 180, 182, and in the preface xl., xli.\n\n1 Yajnavati is her constant name in the Kawi poem, where she is never called\nVermadewi.\n2 The Sanskrit words I transliterate according to the ancient Javanese pronun-\nciation. The labial semi-vowel is represented by w, as it is very improbable that\nit was sounded v, the Sanskrit not having an f, of which the v is the correspond-\ning sonant. The vowels r and \u012b are represented by r\u0113 and \u012b\u0113, the anusvara by\nr, the visarga by h, and the lingual sibilant by \u015b, in accordance with the other\nuguals. The palatal sibilant is here represented by \u015b, and might be transliterated\nr sh, as it was probably pronounced as the French ch, which in the same way\nminated in a k, were it not that sh is in use with the English to represent the\nngual s.\nNo. 17 contains:\n\nI. the 7th book of the \u0628\u0633\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0637\u064a\u0646 (artika kabon sagala raja raja). No. 42 (folio of 440 pages: on the back, Makota sagala raja raja) contains but five books of this work, and No. 8 (folio of 367 pages) only four books and a few pages of the fifth; this copy is written with vowel-signs. This excellent work, complete copies of which are very rare, is divided into seven books, each book containing a certain number of chapters. The author calls himself Nuru-ddin ibn 'Ali ibn Hasanji, son of Muhammad of the Hamid tribe, and a native of Ranir (see No. 78, iv.), and composed it at Achih (Acheen) in the year of the Muhammadan era 1040, by order of Sultan Iskander II. Aliyu-ddin Mu'ayat\u00b9 Sh\u00e2h Johan b\u00e2r dawlat lillu-llahi fi'l'al\u00e2m.\u00b2 The first book (many chapters) treats of the creation of heaven and earth; the second (many chapters) is about prophets and kings; the third (six chapters) on just kings and clever ministers; the fourth (two chapters) on pious kings and holy men\u00b3; the fifth (two chapters) on unjust kings and foolish ministers; the sixth (two chapters) on honoured liberal men and heroes; the seventh (five chapters) on intelligence, and on all sorts of sciences, medical, physionomical, historical, etc. Everywhere a great many tales are given, which might be used for a new Malay Reader. This work gives more than it promises, which in Malay literature may be called a miracle. The twelfth chapter of the second book contains a summary of the history of Malay states; the thirteenth the history of Achih up to the time of the author. In the first chapter of the fourth book there are several tales about the celebrated Ibrahim Ibn Adham, corresponding to some extent with the tale, published by Mr. P. Roorda van Eysinga (Batavia, 1822) and D. Lenting (Breda, 1846) under the title Geschiedenis van Sultan Ibrahim vorst van Irak.\u2074 I have in my possession a manuscript (4to. 194 pages) containing only the first four chapters of the seventh book.\n\n\u00b9 \u0645\u063a\u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0629\n\u00b2 The shadow of God on the world (\u0638\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645).\n\u00b3 \u0623\u0648\u0644\u0645\n\u2074 The Sundanesse version has the title Hibayat Sultan Obiya Henu Ibrahim waliyullah, a copy of which is in my possession (small 4to. 90 pp.)\nII.

This collection of historical tales has been published for the greatest part by Dulaurier in his Chroniques Malayes, and translated by Leyden (Malay Annals, edited by Sir Stamford Raffles). This MS., however, contains chapters not found in other copies, and not translated by Leyden. The last chapter but one, for instance, is about Sang Naya's conspiracy against the Portuguese at Malaka. There are several versions of these chronicles, as the reader will see from the various readings in Dulaurier's edition. No. 35 (folio of 117 pages), No. 89 (folio 120 pages), and No. 68 (small 4to.) end with the death of Hang Kasturi, the last-named number having besides an entirely different introduction, and being properly but an abridgement. In No. 76 (small 4to.) only a part is found commencing with the chapter on the depredations of a Mangkasar prince (\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0628\u064a\u06a0 \u0633\u062c\u0648\u0631\u0643\u0648), and ending with the conquest of Malaka by the Portuguese. No. 80 (4to. of 312 pages), and No. 5 of the Farquhar collection (small 4to. 259 pages) both end also with the conquest of Malaka by the Portuguese. There are a great many copies of this work in Holland as well as in the Indian archipelago, in the government offices, and in the possession of individuals.\n\nNo. 19 (folio of 331 pages) and No. 20 (folio of 365 pages) contain the \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u062f\u0627\u0644\u063a \u0646\u0641\u0631\u062f \u0627\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0631.

As to the contents of this number, it is evident that it is an entirely different work, and by no means to be identified either with No. 2, or the two MSS. at the India Office (see under No. 2). The commencement narrates the birth of Par\u00e1su Rama and Dewa B\u00e1rata, sons of by the celestial nymph Manik. Then Sant\u00e1nu is mentioned, and the birth of his children, who had a peculiar fishy smell about them, as they had been cut out of the belly of a fish, who had swallowed the seed of Sant\u00e1nu. On p. 2, Paras\u00e1ra cures the stinking princess Durgandini, and calls her afterwards Sayojana Suganda (sweet-scented at the distance of a yojana), taking her as his wife. She becomes the mother of Biy\u00e1sa.

Amba becomes the wife of Dewabrata, who kills her by inadvertence. He therefore vows to surrender his life to a woman, burns his wife's body, and then goes to his brother, Parasurama, who consoles him and changes his name into Bisma. On p.34 we find mention made of the birth of Dastardita,\\(^1\\) Pandu Dewa Nata,\\(^2\\) and Widura S\u0101qma.\\(^3\\) Dastar\u0101ta was born blind, because his mother, when visited by Biyasa, from fear closed her eyes; Pandu's body was white as crystal, because his mother had covered herself with a white veil when she conceived him; Widura S\u0101qma was born with one lame leg, as his mother had pulled his leg (?). On p. 38 the birth of Karna is related: he was the son of Sangyang Rawi,\\(^4\\) by Dewi P\u0101ta.\\(^5\\) After this, the meeting is related of Bisnu and the goddess P\u0101tiwi (see under No. 15), and then the birth of Darmadewa and Darmadewi (see under No. 15). On p. 91 we have the birth of K\u0101sna (Kr\u0113\u1e63\u1e47a) and Kak\u0101rsana (a surname of Baladeva). The last chapters relate the contest of Boma against Samba (see under No. 15). Although this composition is but a collection of narratives with no plot whatever to deserve the name of hikayat, it is very interesting, as it introduces nearly all the persons acting in the hikayat p\u0101rang Pand\u0101wa Jaya, and the hikayat Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Boma.\n\nNo. 22 (folio of 720 pages; the commencement is wanting) contains the \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0633\u0631\u064a \u0631\u0627\u0645. It is a very elaborate recension of the Malay Ramayana, from which Marsden has given extracts in the Reader at the end of his Grammar. A far shorter version has been published by Mr. P. P. Roorda van Eysinga (Amsterdam, 1843). A MS. in the Dutch India Office contains also a version of it as elaborate as this; it is in two small 4to. volumes (marked Ned. Kolonien. Handschriften C. No. 1), the first volume being of 475, and the second of 654 pages.\n\nNo. 23 (folio of 698 pages) and No. 45 (4to. of 278 pages). Two copies of the \u062c\u064a\u0643\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0646\u0628\u0639 \u0641\u0627\u062a.

No. 45 seems to belong to the same recension as the two copies of the India Office (No. 2875 small folio, and No. 2691 large 4to). Another version is contained in No. 27 (folio of 347 pages), and No. 28 (folio of 348 pages: on the back of their cover, *Hikayat Dalang Indra Kesuma*). Both these volumes are divided into chapters, each of which contains a tale, connected with the chief story; the first volume contains fifty-four tales and the beginning of the fifty-fifth, whilst the second commences with the fifty-sixth tale. The title, \u062c\u06cc\u06a9\u0644 etc., of this *Panji* tale is after a name which the hero takes on his rambles in search of the princess of Daha, disguising himself as a man of the lowest class. This is one of the most interesting Malay compositions, and has influenced almost every literary production of the Malays; on another occasion I shall give an analysis of it. This cycle of stories has received by mistake also the name of \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0646\u0627\u064a \u0643\u0633\u0648 from its commencement, where a B\u00e2tara Naya Kasuma, an inhabitant of Indra\u2019s heaven, is spoken of as the grand-father of K\u00e2rtapati.\n\nNo. 24 (two folio volumes of 446 and 450 pages) contain the \u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0647 \u0631\u0627\u062c\u0627 \u062f\u0627\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u062c\u0627\u0648. The first volume commences of course with Adam, whose son was Shith (\u0634\u064a\u062b), whose son was Nurchaya, whose son was Sangyang Wenang, whose son was Sangyang Tunggal, whose son was Guru, who had four sons and one daughter, being Sangyang Sambu, Barahma, Mah\u00e1deva, Bisnu, and Dewi Sari. Bisnu became king of Java with the title Prabu Seta (? \u0633\u064a\u062a). Then a chapter treats of the Ratu Sela Parwata of Giling Basi. It ends with Pangeran Dipati taking the title of Susunan Mangku Rat Senapati, etc. The second volume commences with Susunan Mangku Rat being at Banu Mas, and ordering the Dipati of Tegal to be fetched, and terminates with Susunan Pakubuwana\u2019s reign in K\u00e2rtasura. Two quotations from this work have been given by Dulaurier in the Journal Asiatique for 1846.\n\n1 See my \u201cKort Verslag der Mal. Handschriften van het East India House te Londen.\u201d\nNo. 25 (folio of 304 pages). This Panji tale goes by the name of \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u063a \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0646 \u0631\u0633\u0645\u0649 from a name the heroine assumes when leading the life of a penitent. The commencement treats of the prince of Kuripan, called Kuda Jaya Asmara, surnamed Kartapati, who was betrothed to the princess of Daha, Raden Galuh Chandrakirana puspaning rat. A god falling in love with the said princess asked her of Batara Guru, but meeting with a refusal, as she was to be the wife of Kartapati, dropped her with her two waiting women into a forest, where she led the life of a penitent, and changed her name and that of her companions. She is afterwards married to the prince, here passim called Raden Inu, who succeeds his father with the title of Parabu Anom ing Kuripan, the old king retiring to the woods to do penance.\n\nNo. 26 (folio of 239 pages). This Panji tale goes by the name \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0646\u062c \u0648\u064a\u0644 \u0643\u0633\u0648\u0645. The commencement is almost the same as that of No. 23, relating the birth of Inu Kartapati, and that of the Raden Galuh Puspaning rat, surnamed Chandrakirana. Going in quest of his love, who is carried off by Batara Kala into a forest, the hero takes the name Mesa Taman Panji Jayeng Kasuma. Afterwards in the course of the narrative he is called Sira Panji Wila Kasuma (p. 73 of MS.), but often merely Sira Panji. After a great many adventures he becomes king of all Jawa. Werndly in his Maleische Boekzaal mentions a Hikayat Mesa Taman Wila Kasuma, and van Ho\u00ebvell in his annotations on the Sair Bidasari has given quotations from a Hikayat Panji Wila Kasuma, pp. 301, 326, 334, 339, 362, 363, and 374.\n\nNos. 27 and 28. See under No. 23.\n\nNo. 29 (folio, 645 pages; ends abruptly). This Panji tale has the lettering Hikayat Naga Bersru (on the fly-leaf within). I dare not decide whether this is right, as I did not succeed in finding the reason for this title. Leyden, in his Dissertation on the Indo-Chinese Nations (As. Res. x.) speaks of a\n\n---\n\n1 From the Javanese endang (a female penitent or nun).\n2 Jav. Mesa (Mahipa, buffalo) is frequent in proper names of Javanese personages, and sometimes rendered by the equivalent Javanese kebo.\n3 Amuter jagad jawa (Jav.).\nHikayat Naga Bisaru,\\(^1\\) or story of a princess of Daha, who was changed into a serpent, and banished to a lake. It is a pity he gave no explanation of the name. At all events this manuscript belongs to the Panji tales. It opens with the king of Kuripan asking for his son, the Raden Inu Karta pati, the hand of the princess of Daha, Chandarakirana. The hero is here passim called Sira Panji and Sri Panji.\n\nNo. 30 (small folio of 74 pages; the wrong lettering on the back of the cover, Salasilah nabi Muhammad, is owing to the first words, which make Nuru-ddin a descendant of the prophet's) contains the genealogical account of the kings of Cheribon (properly, Chi-rebon), commencing with a confused tale about Sheykh Nuru-ddin, sur- named the Suhunan Gunung Jati, one of the apostles of the Islam in Java. It is probably translated from a peculiar dialect of the Javanese, its language being anything but Malay, and mixed up with Javanese and occasionally with Sundanese words too. Besides the said Suhunan (\"Reverend\"), other celebrated apostles, as the Suhunan's Kali Jaga, Ampel Danta, and Bonang are personated here as people endowed with miraculous gifts, and the conquest of Majapahit, Bant\u00e9n (Bantam), and Pajajaran (called here too by its ancient name Pakawan) is briefly narrated. The Panembahan Sura Sohan, called also Mowlana Hasanuddin, introduces, according to this chronicle, the Islam in Pajajaran, the Lampong country, Indrapura, Bangka-ulu (Bencoolen), and Balo. His elder brother, the Panembahan Pakung Wati rules the country from Krawang to Cheribon, he himself that from Bantam to Krawang. This manuscript makes use occasionally of the linguals \\(q\\) and \\(r\\).\\(^2\\) From it some valuable materials might be gleaned for a work on Javanese history, the last pages containing an account of the kings of Cheribon down to Sultan Anom.\n\nNo. 31 (folio of 411 pages) contains the \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0642\u0628\u0627\u062f.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This bisaru and bersaru of the lettering, I should like to explain by \u0628\u0631\u0633\u0631\u0648 in the sense of to cry invoking the gods.\n\n\\(^2\\) e.g. \u0645\u0648\u0646\u0648\u06af\u06a9\u0646 and \u0628\u0637\u0627\u0631 (bhatdra).\nThe hero is the son of Shah Partsad Indara Lagasana, situated in the neighbourhood of Mount Laf. This king, although powerful, was forced to pay tribute to the monkey-king Baliya Indara, whose residence was Kurdari (\u0643\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631\u064a). The king's eldest son, called in the commencement Qubad Lela Indara, and afterward Shah Hubad Johan 'Arifin, could not put up with his father's ingratitude, and resolved to deliver his parent from the allegiance to the monkey-king. He is in several ways assisted by genii, who prove to be his relatives, and wages war against the powerful enemy.

The father of the hero is called here Shah Parmat Indara Lagasana, and the residence of the monkey-king Kardar (\u0643\u0631\u062f\u0627\u0631). An entirely different version (85 pages, and ending abruptly) of No. 58; it goes by the name of \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0631\u0627\u062c \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u062c\u0648\u0647\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0627\u0645\u063a\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0627. The hero in this recension the son of Bakarma Chandara, king of aranta Indara.

Malay compositions borrow from each other proper names; so, for instance, we find Indara Kila (mountain, where Arjuna lived as penitent), Minraga (name of a cave, where Arjuna did penance, Sanscr. and Kawi witaraga, sinless), and other proper names from the Kawi poem Wivaha (in Malay \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u062f\u0627\u062a\u064a \u0646\u064a\u0644 \u0643\u0648\u0627 from a Titan conquered by Arjuna) occurring in other impositions.

After a pregnancy of seven years the queen was delivered of a boar of a terrifying appearance, with tusks as yellow as a ripe plantain fruit.\\(^1\\) The king ordered his minister to throw his son into the woods, where the young hog conquered the king of the hogs, being assisted by a princess who was doing penance on the field of their contest. Having been victorious, he was bathed by that princess, and treated in her residence as her son. After taking leave of her, he is carried away by a jin, etc. This composition is replete with pantuns, and the text is not much corrupted. The language is genuine Malay as far as I have read it.

Mangindara Chuwacha, king of Indra Parchangga, had two sons called Raja Shah Johan Mangindara Rupa and Raja Thahir\u00b3 Johan Shah. The king having dreamt of a wonderful musical instrument, which sounded one hundred and ninety times when but once struck, and longing to have it, the two young princes go in quest of it. They are adopted by a ghost, of the name of \u0631\u0627\u062c \u0633\u0644\u0645, who tells them where to find the wonderful instrument. He changes their names, calling the eldest prince Indra Mahadewa Sagi, and the youngest Bisnu Dewa Kaindara-an, surnamed Indra Laqsa\u00f1a. The brothers are separated afterwards, each of them achieving a great many stirring feats by the assistance of the jin, their adoptive father.

The hero assuming in the course of his rambles the name of Ind\u0101ra Jaya, this very popular tale goes also by the name of \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0627\u064a.

The hero, called \"the sun of the earth,\" is the son of Darma Dikara, king of Paruwa Chakara Nagara in Hindustan. His name he owes to his being predestined to be a powerful king, ruling over the earth and sea, whence he was surnamed \"the moon of the sea.\" When twelve years old he was carried off by an infidel jin, in consequence of which he had a great many adventures before he returned home.

Having been answered by the prophet satisfactorily, a great many Jews of the said tribe embrace the Islam. It is translated from the Persian. A manuscript of this composition (small 4to. of 156 pages) I saw at Barus in the possession of the Tuwanku of Sigambo-gambo. A copy is also in the possession of Prof. H. C. Millies at Utrecht. It is a very interesting work, and reproduces the popular belief of the Malays about a great many questions of the Muhammedan faith.

The wrong lettering is owing to he commencement, where a just king (Raja 'adil) whose name is not mentioned, is forced to flee from his dominions, and is afterwards made captive by an unjust king. This MS. however, contains another version than that from which de Hollander has given extracts in his Reader (p. 131 sqq.) and transliterated in his Handleiding tot de Kennis der Maleische taal (Breda, 1845). The name of the person who found the child of which the queen was delivered during her flight with her consort, and which she was forced to leave, is here mentioned. The last tale in this manuscript is the story of Salomon and the queen of Sab\u0101. The text is pretty good, but occasionally corrupted. The introduction especially differs widely from that of other versions I know. I possess a copy (folio of 50 pages), wherein the number of tales told by Bakhtiyar amounts to nine. Its version differs from that of de Hollander's text.

I am in hopes the deficiencies in this notice may be filled up by other scholars, who will also call attention to the many valuable Malay manuscripts in the Libraries of London. A new Malay Chrestomathy is urgently needed at the present time, as those published by Marsden, Meursinge, and de Javellander, are anything but trustworthy, each of the texts they contain having been taken from a single manuscript only. It is only by a careful comparison of any that a text can be furnished which may be depended upon by persons desirous of obtaining an adequate idea of the grammatical structure of the Malay language, and reluctant to trust the assertions of those who pretend that Malay is void of grammar.\nART. V.\u2014Brief Prefatory Remarks to the Translation of the Amit\u0101bha S\u016btra from Chinese. By the Rev. S. Beal, Chaplain R. N.\n\n[Read 6th February, 1865.]\n\nThe following translation of the Amit\u0101bha S\u016btra is made from the Chinese edition of that work, prepared by Kum\u0101ra-j\u012bva, and bound up in a volume known as the \"Daily Prayers of the Buddhist Priests belonging to the Contemplative School\" (Shan-mun).\n\nNo doubt the Chinese version is much abbreviated. We are told that Kum\u0101raj\u012bva omitted repetitions and superfluities in making his translations. We have reason to be thankful that he did so.\n\nThe Amit\u0101bha S\u016btra contains a description of the Western Heavens, the Sukhavati, or Happy Land, to which so many millions of Buddhists look as their reward in another life. It is a question of some importance at what time this belief in a Western Paradise incorporated itself with Buddhism.\n\nIn fixing the period we may be certain that it was before the date of Kum\u0101raj\u012bva, i.e. 400 A.D.; and if it be correct that the Chinese translation of the \"Wou-liang-shen-king,\" i.e. the S\u016btra of Amit\u0101bha, under the name of the \"Eternal,\" dates from the Han dynasty (Edkins), we may go back to the first century A.D. as the latest admissible date for the origin of this belief.\n\nWassiljew hazards the remark that the idea of a Western Paradise was borrowed from foreigners, with whom the Buddhists of Southern India were brought into contact (Wassiljew, Der Buddhismus, \u00a7 121). We know that merchants from Alexandria frequented the Western shores of the peninsula at an early date. There was a Christian mission established in the same direction as early as the days of Pant\u00e6nus (Fabricius, Lux Evang., c. 36, p. 637; Hough's\nWe know also that two of the principal writers in the developed schools of Buddhism, viz., \u0100g\u0101rjuna and \u0100ryadeva, were born and lived in South India (Wassiljew, \u00a7 212). Taking the date of \u0100ryadeva to be about 100 A.D., for he was the fourth patriarch after \u0100\u015bvagho\u1e63a, who was contemporary with Kanishka, we may gain regard this as an approximate date for the origin of the belief in a Western Paradise, and of the writings bearing on that belief. The connection of this worship with South India is still further illustrated by the reverence paid to Avalokite\u015bvara, the reputed son of Amit\u0101bha, in that quarter. Iouen Thsang relates that \"in the country of the Mo-lo-ye (Malayas), in South-western India, there is a celebrated peak called Potalaka, on which Kwan-tseu-tsai, i.e. Avalokite\u015bvara, frequently locates himself in coming and going, and appears under various shapes to pilgrims visiting the neighborhood\" (Julien). Now this peak Potalaka may be either the celebrated Pedura-talla-galla, one of the highest mountains in Ceylon, and belonging to the Malaya-giri of urnouf, or the Male\u00e6 Montes of Pliny and Ptolemy; or it may be one of the eminences of the southern gh\u0101ts of Malabar. In either case it is certain that with this mountain is connected the extensive worship paid to Avalokite\u015bvara; and so again is spoken of as the Bodhisattva, or active power of Amit\u0101bha, whose worship may therefore be presumed to have risen in the same locality, i.e. South India. Avalokite\u015bvara, being spoken of as the son of Amit\u0101bha, seems to confirm the idea of the presence of a foreign, and perhaps a Christian, element in this singular cultus. Whether the term \"Western Paradise,\" and its description found in the S\u016btra which follows, bears out this idea we leave others to judge.\n\nIn popular Buddhist language, Amit\u0101bha is spoken of as the fourth Dhy\u0101ni Buddha, corresponding to \u015a\u0101kya Muni amongst the M\u0101nushi Buddhas. Respecting the land over which he rules, we find the following description in a popular work on the subject:\u2014\"Amit\u0101bha reigns over the land Sukhavati, which, compared with our world, bears due west exactly 100,000 billions of Sakwalas. In respect to the tiers\nof Sakwalas, which rise one above the other, springing from\nthe mystic Lotus, this land Sukhavat\u012b belongs to the thir-\nteenth tier. In about the middle of this tier is our own\nworld, and at the extreme western border of it the land of\nAmit\u0101bha\u201d (Fah-kai-lih-to).\n\nThe hold which the worship of Amit\u0101bha has taken upon\nthe popular mind, in China and Japan, can hardly be exag-\ngerated\u2014in every direction his name is engraved or inscribed,\nto call the attention of the passer-by to the efficacy of repea-\nting it, and the great majority of popular Buddhist writings\nhave relation to the same subject. Amongst many thousand\ntracts, which came under my own notice, in the Temples of\nCanton, after its capture in 1857, the larger number related\neither to Kwan-yin (Avalokitesvara) or to the Western\nParadise of Amit\u0101bha. One particularly attracted my atten-\ntion,\u2014this was a sheet representing a boat, full of people,\npassing over the sea to the opposite shore, guided by\nAmit\u0101bha himself, and steered by Kwan-yin; upon this sheet\nthere was an exhortation within, in which the power of\nAmit\u0101bha is set forth, by way of comparison with other\nmodes of salvation, much to the advantage of the former\u2014for\nit asserts \u201cother methods of deliverance are like the progress\nof an insect up a high mountain, but this method (i.e. of\nAmit\u0101bha) is like the advance of a boat sailing with a fair\nwind and propitious tide; on once entering the Western\nParadise (continues the exhortation) there is no return\u2014the\nhighest rank there, is that of Buddha, the lowest, that of the\nmost exalted Deva. Again, whilst the happiness of this\ncondition is so great, the mode of attaining it is equally\nsimple. In this mode of salvation, there are no distinctions\nof rich and poor, of male and female, of people and priests:\nall are equally able to arrive at this condition. Let every\nvirtuous person therefore nourish in himself a principle of\nfaith\u2014let him with constant and undivided attention, invoke\nthe name of Amit\u0101bha Buddha, and thus he shall eventually\nbe saved in the Paradise of the Western Heavens.\u201d\n\nOn the sail of the boat (which bears a flag, inscribed with\nthe word Sukhavat\u012b, and which is represented as being full\nof happy disciples, male and female,) is written this scroll.\n\n\"The one name of O-mi-to (Amit\u00e2bha) is a precious sword for destroying the whole concourse of evils. This one name, O-mi-to, is the brave champion that defies the power of hell\u2014this one name, O-mi-to, is the bright lamp that dissipates darkness\u2014this one name, O-mi-to, is the boat of mercy, on which we may cross the sea of trouble\u2014this one name, O-mi-to, is the direct path for escaping the entanglement of frequent transmigration\u2014this one name, O-mi-to, is the perfect mode by which to avoid life and death\u2014this one name, O-mi-to, is the mysterious power which endows us with superhuman faculties\u2014this one name, O-mi-to, is the best mode for divining secrets. These six letters, i.e. Na-mo, O-mi-to, Fuh, include all the 84,000 methods of salvation; they are able, with one stroke, as it were, to divide the bonds that hold us captive; there is no such invocation as that of O-mi-to, which, in the twinkling of an eye, is able to transport us to the Western Heavens.\"\n\nThis is a fair sample of the popular mode of Buddhist teaching among the lower orders in China, and as a natural result, the highest aim of the convert to this doctrine is to repeat, with little intermission, the name of O-mi-to, Fuh, O-mi-to, Fuh, till the desired result be attained\u2014i.e., emancipation from all earthly troubles, and a certain admission after death to Paradise.\n\nThe southern schools of Buddhism, viz., in Ceylon, Siam, and Annam, know nothing of Amit\u00e2bha or his Western Paradise. This fact seems to point to the late development of the doctrine in India. Probably, however, intercourse between the island and the mainland was prevented at an early date by the warlike character of the Malabar population. Fah Hian, we know, arrived at the island by sea, and Hiouen Thsang, for some reason or other, avoided all the southern portion of the peninsula, and did not visit Ceylon. In fact, there appears to be an early break between the Buddhist current of teaching followed by the Indian teachers and those in Ceylon, the result of which is the vastly different aspect under which that religion presents itself in\nthose countries. It was, however, from Southern India that the great teacher of the doctrine of a Western Paradise arrived in China. Bodhidharma, the twenty-eighth patriarch, and the founder of the contemplative school, reached that country by sea A.D. 526. He seems to have brought with him the very name which is now used in China to denote the school of which he was the first patriarch. The word \"Shan,\" according to Edkins, was formerly written \"jan,\" and this contracted from jan-na, pointing evidently to the Indian word Jaina. This confirms the opinion that the Jaina religion is but an off-shoot of later Buddhism.\n\nWith respect to Bodhidharma, there is a legend still existing in China which exemplifies his belief in the doctrine of a Western Heaven, \"for as he lay in his coffin (we are told) he held one shoe in his hand. Whilst thus situated, his remains were visited by a celebrated priest called Sung-yun, who asked him where he was going; to which he replied, 'To the Western Heavens.' Sung-yun then returned home; but afterwards the coffin of Bodhidharma was opened and found empty, except one of his shoes, which still remained. By imperial command this shoe was preserved as a sacred relic. Afterwards, in the Tang dynasty, it was stolen, and no one now knows where it is\" (Edkins).\n\nI now pass at once to the translation.\n\nTHE AMIT\u00c2BHA S\u00dbTRA.\n\nExtracted from the work called \"Shan Mun Yih Tung,\" or Daily Prayers of the Contemplative School of Priests.\n\nThus have I heard. On a certain occasion Buddha was residing at Sr\u00e2vasti, in the garden of Kita, with the great Bhikshus, 1,250 in all, being great Rahats, possessed of perfect knowledge, to wit, the venerable S\u00e2riputra, the great Maudgaly\u00e2yana, the great K\u00e2syapa, the great K\u00e2ty\u00e2yana, the great Gochira, Revata, \u015arutavim\u015batikoti, Nanda, \u0100nanda, Rahula, Gav\u00e2mpati, Pi\u1e47\u1e0dola, Bharadv\u00e2ja, K\u00e2l\u0101ditya, the great Kapphi\u1e47a, Vakula, Aniruddha, and so forth, all great disciples. And in addition to these were all the great Bodhisattvas; to wit, Manju\u1e63r\u00ee, king of the law, Ajita, Maitreya,\nand so forth, all great Bodhisattvas; and, moreover, there were present \u015aakra r\u0101j\u0101 and others, with innumerable Devas. At this time Buddha addressed the venerable \u015a\u0101riputra as follows:\u2014\"In the western regions more than one hundred thousand myriads of systems of worlds beyond this, there is a Sakwala named Sukhavat\u012b. Why is this region so named? Because all those born in it have no griefs or sorrows: they experience only unmixed joys; therefore it is named the infinitely happy land. Again, \u015a\u0101riputra, this happy region is surrounded by seven rows of ornamental railings, seven rows of exquisite curtains, seven rows of waving trees\u2014hence, again, it is called the infinitely happy region. Again, \u015a\u0101riputra, this happy land possesses seven gemmous lakes, in the midst of which flow waters possessed of the eight distinctive qualities (viz., limpidity and purity, refreshing coolness, sweetness, softness, fertilizing qualities, calmness, power of preventing famine, productiveness of abundance). Spreading over the bottom of these lakes are golden sands, whilst the four sides have pleasant walks enriched with gold, silver, crystal, lapis lazuli, beryl, ruby, and cornelian. In the middle of the lakes are lotus flowers, large as a chariot wheel, blue, yellow, red, and white, each reflecting brilliant hues of its own colour, and possessed of the most perfect and delightful fragrance. Thus, O \u015a\u0101riputra, this blessed region is perfected and thoroughly adorned.\n\n\"Again, \u015a\u0101riputra, the land of that Buddha ever shares in heavenly delights (or, music), the ground is resplendent gold, at morning and evening showers of the Divine Udumbara flower descend upon all those born there, at early dawn the most exquisite blossoms burst out at their side: thousand myriads of Buddhas instantly resort here for refreshment, and then return to their own regions, and for this reason, \u015a\u0101riputra, that land is called most happy. Again, \u015a\u0101riputra, that region is possessed of every species of pleasure delightful to the senses, birds of every hue, the white stork, the peacock, the macaw, garudas, birds of every kind, all these, at morning and evening, unite to sing the praises of the Law, so that all born in that land, hearing these notes, are led to invoke\nBuddha, the Law and the Assembly. But, \u015a\u0101riputra, you must not suppose that these birds are born in this state in the way of retribution for sins in a superior condition, and why not? Because, in that region there exists not either of the three evil ways of birth (i.e., as a beast, demon, or asura). \u015a\u0101riputra! that land being emphatically free from these evil ways of birth, is thereby more fully possessed of the superior ways of birth, and these different kinds of birds are all of them the different apparitional forms of superior beings, whom Amit\u0101bha Buddha causes thus to chaunt the various sounds of the land. \u015a\u0101riputra! in that land of Buddha, whenever a gentle breeze moves softly, then the various precious waving trees, and the gemmous curtain that surrounds the land, emit a gentle and mysterious sound, like a thousand different kinds of music, all at the same time; on hearing which, the dwellers in that land conceive, spontaneously, a heart full of adoration for Buddha, the Law, and the Assembly.\n\n\"\u015a\u0101riputra, this land is thus perfectly adorned, and complete in pleasure.\n\n\"But now, \u015a\u0101riputra, you would perhaps enquire, why the Buddha of that region is called Amit\u0101bha. \u015a\u0101riputra! it is because he is unmeasurably bright and glorious, so that his splendour fills the lands of the ten regions, and no obstacle can oppose the diffusion of the rays of his glory,\u00b9 for this reason, he is called Amit\u0101bha. Again, \u015a\u0101riputra, the years of the life of that Buddha, as men compute them, are endless, and without bound, in asankhyas of years\u2014for this reason, also, he is called Amit\u0101bha. For ten kalpas of years, that Buddha has enjoyed his present condition, and has for his disciples an endless and incalculable number of \u015ar\u0101vakas, all of them Rahats, innumerable, and not to be expressed for multitude, and Bodhisattvas equally vast in number. So it is, \u015a\u0101riputra, that land of Buddha is perfected. Again, \u015a\u0101riputra, in that land of perfect joy all who are born, are born as Avaivartyas (never to return),\u00b2 whilst among these there are numbers who make this their resting place, before\n\n\u00b9 Burn. Introd., p. 100. \u00b2 Lalita Vistara, 267.\nthat one birth more (which shall end in their arriving at Buddhahood); infinite are these in number, not to be expressed for multitude, simply innumerable.\n\n\"\u015a\u0101riputra! all mortals who hear this account, ought to offer up this one vow\u2014that they may be born in that country\u2014and why? because, if once born there, they obtain the felicity of only one more appearance as superior sages (and then obtain the condition of Buddha.) \u015a\u0101riputra, it is not possible to be born in that country possessing an inferior Karma; \u015a\u0101riputra! if there be a virtuous man or woman, who hears this account of Amit\u0101bha Buddha, and who assiduously invokes his name for one day or two, up to seven, and during this time maintains a heart unaffected by worldly thoughts, or confused ideas\u2014that man or woman, when about to die, shall be blessed with a clear vision of Amit\u0101bha and all his saints, and at the last moment, if his heart be not turned back, he shall depart, and forthwith be born in that most blessed land of Amit\u0101bha Buddha. \u015a\u0101riputra! I perceive that such will be the happy consequence (of so doing) and therefore I repeat these words; whatever men they be who hear them, they ought at once to utter this vow, that they may be born in that land.\n\n\"\u015a\u0101riputra! thus it is I would recite in stanzas of commendation, the excellences of that infinitely glorious land of Amit\u0101bha Buddha.\n\n[The S\u016btra then proceeds to speak of the various Buddhas towards each of the four points, and also in the zenith and nadir. This being a mere recital of names, is omitted here.]\n\n\"\u015a\u0101riputra! what say you as to the meaning of this expression, the saving power which resides in the repetition of the names of all the Buddhas? \u015a\u0101riputra! if there be a virtuous man or woman who hears and receives this S\u016btra, and who hears the names of all the Buddhas, these virtuous men or women, in consequence of the saving power which resides in the repetition of these names, shall all obtain the privilege of not passing through and revolving in the condition of Anuttara Samyak Sambodhi, i.e. the unsurpassably just and enlightened heart. (This is the condition usually\nassigned to the Bodhisattva, before arriving at the state Buddha). Wherefore, \u015a\u0101riputra, ye all ought to receive and believe these my words, and the words of all the Buddhas.\n\n\"\u015a\u0101riputra! if there be a man who has vowed, or vows, or shall vow and desire, to be born in that region, these men shall be privileged not to remain or revolve in the condition of Anuttara Samyak Sambodhi, but to be born once in their various conditions in the land of that Buddha whether in time past, now, or henceforth. Wherefore, \u015a\u0101riputra, whatever faithful man or woman there be, they ought all to put up this prayer, that they may be born in that land. \u015a\u0101riputra, as I have now thus recounted the praises of these Buddhas, their indescribable excellences, so the Buddhas likewise recount my praises and infinite excellences and speak thus:\u2014'\u015a\u0101kya Muni Buddha is he that is able (\u0935\u093f\u0928\u093e\u092f\u0915) to accomplish most difficult results (prompted by) exceeding love\u2014he it is who is \"able\" in the So-ho world (Sah\u0101lokadh\u0101tu), the evil world of five impurities (vi\u015be\u1e63a violence, perception, calamities, birth, death); he it is who is \"able,\" in the midst of these, to arrive at the condition of Anuttara Samyak Sambodhi, and on account of all sentient creatures to repeat his Law, difficult to be embraced by those for whom it is said.'\n\n\"\u015a\u0101riputra! know, then, that I, in the midst of this evil and calamitous world, preaching these difficult doctrines, have arrived at the condition of Anuttara Samyak Sambodhi; and now, on account of all creatures, have declared this Law difficult to be believed, and this is that which is most difficult.\"\n\nBuddha having repeated this S\u016btra, \u015a\u0101riputra and all the Bhikshus, and all the assembly, the Devas, Asuras, and on, having heard what Buddha said, joyfully received and believed it, and having prostrated themselves in adoration departed.\nART. VI.\u2014The Initial Coinage of Bengal. By Edward Thomas, Esq.\n\nTowards the end of August, 1863, an unusually large hoard of coins, numbering in all no less than 13,500 pieces of silver, was found in the Protected State of Kooch Bah\u00e1r, in Northern Bengal, the contents of which were consigned, in the ordinary payment of revenue, to the Imperial Treasury in Calcutta. Advantage was wisely sought to be taken of the possible arch\u00e6ological interest of such a discovery, in selections directed to be made from the general bulk to enrich the medal cabinets of the local Mint and the Museum of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. The task of selection, and with it of inevitably final rejection, was entrusted to B\u00e1bu Rajendra-l\u00e1l-Mitra,\u2014an experienced scholar in many branches of Sanskrit literature, and who, in the absence of more practised Numismatists, courageously encountered the novel study and impromptu exposition of Semitic Palaeography as practically developed in his own native land six centuries ago. The B\u00e1bu, after having assiduously completed his selections for the Government,\u00b9 was considerate enough to devote himself to renewed and more critical examinations of this mass of coined metal, with a view to secure for Colonel C. S. Guthrie (late of the Bengal Engineers), any examples of importance that might have escaped his earlier investigations. The result has been that more than a thousand additional specimens have been rescued from the Presidency Mint crucibles, and now contribute the leading materials for the subjoined monograph.\n\nAn autumnal fall of a river bank, not far removed from the traditional capital of Kunte\u00e7ar R\u00e1ja, a king of mark in provincial annals,\u00b2 disclosed to modern eyes the hidden trea-\n\n\u00b9 J. A. S. Bengal, 1864, p. 480.\n\u00b2 Col. J. C. Haughton, to whom we are mainly indebted for the knowledge of this trouv\u00e9ille, has been so obliging as to furnish me with some interesting\nsure of some credulous mortal who, in olden time, entrusted his wealth to the keeping of an alluvial soil, carefully stored and secured in brass vessels specially constructed for the purpose, but destined to contribute undesignedly to an alien inheritance, and a disentombment at a period much posterior to that contemplated by its depositor. This accumulation, so singular in its numerical amount, is not the less remarkable in the details of its component elements\u2014whether as regards the, so to say, newness and sharpness of outline of the majority of the pieces themselves, the peculiarly local character of the whole collection, or its extremely limited range in point of time. It may be said to embrace compactly the records of ten kings, ten mint cities, and to represent 107 years of the annals of the country. The date of its inhumation may be fixed, almost with precision, towards the end of the eighth century A.H., or the fourteenth century A.D. A very limited proportion of the entire aggregation was contributed by external currencies, and the imperial metropolis of Dehli alone intervenes to disturb the purely indigenous issues, and that merely to the extent of less than 150 out of the 13,500 otherwise unmixed produce of Bengal Mints.\n\nDetails of the site of discovery and illustrations of the neighbouring localities. Col. Haughton writes:\u2014\"The place where the coin was found is about three miles S.W. of Deenhatta, not far from the Temple of Kuntewaree (or Komit-Eswaree) on the banks of the river Dhurla. Near to this temple is a place called Gossin Morae, a short distance from which are the ruins of Kuntesur Raja's capital called Kuntewaree-Pat, consisting of a mound of considerable extent, which has been surrounded with several ditches and walls, which are again protected at the distance of a mile or two by enormous mounds of nearly 100 feet high. The brass vessels, in which the treasure was deposited, were ordinary brass lotas, to which the top or lip had not been fixed, but in lieu thereof the vessels were covered by canister tops, secured by an iron spike passing from side to side.\"\n\nI wish to explain the reservations I make in thus stating this total below that given in Rajendra Lal's list of 150 coins of seven Dehli kings (J.A.S.B., September, 1864, p. 481). In the first place, I greatly mistrust the reading of the sixth king's title. Muhammad bin Tughlak was called Fakhr-ad-din Jahan in his youth only; on his first mission to the Dakhin in 721 A.H. the higher title of Ulugh Khan was conferred upon him by his father, but from the date of his accession to the throne of Hindustan, he contented himself with the use of his simple name and patronymic; no longer the \"glory of the faith,\" he was the far more humble \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062f\u0646 \u0628\u062a\u0623\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646, or the conventional \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0627\u0647\u062f \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 (Zia-i-Barni, Calcutta edit., p. 196), both of which were so persistently copied by the independent Bengal Sultan. Certainly no such title as \u0641\u062e\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 occurs on any of the specimens of the Koest\nThe exclusively home characteristics of the great majority of the collection are enlivened by the occasional intrusion of mementos of imperial re-assertions, and numismatic contributions from other independent sources aid in the casual illustration of the varying political conditions of the province, and of the relations maintained from time to time between the too-independent governors of a distant principality and their liege suzerains at Dehli.\n\nMuhammadan writers have incidentally preserved a record of the fact, that on the first entry of their armies into Bengal, they found an exclusive cowrie or shell currency, assisted possibly by bullion in the larger payments, but associated with no coined money of any description;\u00b9 a heritage of primitive\n\n\u00b9 Minhaj-al-Siraj, who was resident in Lakhnauti in A.H. 641, writes\n\nTabakat-i-Nasiri, p. 149, Calcutta printed edition (1864). Ibn Batutah gives an account of the collection of the cowrie shells in the Maldives Islands, from whence they were exported to Bengal in exchange for rice; the gradational quantities and values are detailed as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{\u0633\u064a\u0627\u0647} = 100 \\text{cowries}, \\quad \\text{\u0646\u0627\u0644} = 700. \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0648} = 12000, \\quad \\text{\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0648} = 100,000, \\text{four bustus were estimated as worth one gold dinar}; \\text{but the rate of exchange varied considerably, so that occasionally a dinar would purchase as many as twelve bustus, or twelve laks of cowries!} \\] (French edit., iv., p. 121. Lee's Translation, p. 178.) Sir Henry Elliot mentions that \"in India, in 1740, a rupee exchanged for 2,400 cowries; in 1756, for 2,560 cowries; and (in 1845) as many as 6,500 could be obtained for a rupee.\"\u2014Glossary of Indian Terms, p. 373. They were estimated in the currency scheme of 1833 at 6,400 per rupee.\u2014Prinsep's U.T., p. 2. Major Rennell, who was in Silhet in 1767-8, speaking of the cowrie money, remarks: \"I found no other currency of any kind in the country; and upon an occasion when an increase in the revenue of the province was enforced, several boat loads (not less than 50 tons each) were collected and sent down the Burrampooter to Dacca.\" As late as 1801 the revenues of the British district of Silhet \"were\nbarter, indeed, which survived undisturbed in many of the outlying districts up to the early part of the present century. The consistent adherence of the people to this simple medium of exchange, goes far to explain an enigma, recently adverted to,\\(^1\\) as to the general absence of all specimens of money of high antiquity within certain limits northward of the seaboard, and may serve to reconcile the anomaly of conterminous nationalities appearing in such different degrees of advancement when tried by similar isolated tests of local habitudes. For the rest, the arms of Isl\u00e1m clearly brought with them into Bengal what modern civilization deems a fiscal necessity\u2014a scheme of national coinage; and the present enquiry is concerned to determine when and in what form the conquerors applied the theory and practice they themselves had as yet but imperfectly realized.\n\nWhen Muhammad bin S\u00e1m had so far consolidated his early successes in India into a design of permanent occupancy, leaving a viceroy and generalissimo in Dehli, in the person of Kutb-ud-d\u00edn Aibek, while his own court was still held at Ghazn\u00ed, the scattered subordinate commanders each sought to extend the frontiers of the faith beyond the limits already acquired. In pursuance of this accepted mission, Muhammad Bakht\u00ed\u00e1r Khilj\u00ed, Sipahs\u00e1l\u00e1r in Oude, in A.H. 599, pushed his forces southward, and expelled, with but little effort, the ancient Hindu dynasty of Nuddeah, superseding that city as the capital, and transferring the future metropolis of Bengal to the proximate site of Lakhnaut\u00ed, where he ruled undisturbed by higher authority till his own career was prematurely cut short in A.H. 602.\n\nConsidering the then existing time-honoured system of valuation by shells\u2014which would certainly not invite a hasty issue of coin\u2014and Muhammad Bakht\u00ed\u00e1r's acknowledged subordination to Kutb-ud-d\u00edn, who, so far as can be seen, uttered no money in his own name, it may fairly be inferred that if a single piece was produced, it formed a part only of an occasional, or special,\n\n\\(^{1}\\) J.R.A.S., vol. i., N.S., p. 473-4.\nmedallic mintage\u2014a numismatic Fatah-n\u00e1mah, or assertion and declaration of conquest and supremacy alone, designedly avoiding any needless interference with the fixed trade by adventitious monetary complications, which so unprogressive a race as the Hindus would naturally be slow to appreciate.\n\nSimilar motives may be taken to have prevailed in the north, where the least possible change was made in the established currency of the country, extending, indeed, to a mere substitution of names in the vernacular character on the coin, which was allowed to retain the typical \"Bull and Horseman\" device of Prithvi R\u00e1ja and his predecessors. The pieces themselves, designated from their place of mintage Dehli-w\u00e1las, were composed of a mixture of silver and copper in intentionally graduated proportions, but of the one fixed weight of thirty-two ratis, or the measure of the old Pur\u00e1na of silver of Manu's day. Progressive modifications were effected in the types and legends of these coins, but no systematic reconstruction of the circulating media took place until the reign of Altamsh; who, however, left the existing currencies undisturbed, as the basis for the introduction of the larger and more valuable and exclusively silver popularly known in after times as the Tankah, a standard which may also be supposed to have followed traditional weights in the contents assigned to it, as the 96 rati-piece modern ideas would identify with the Tolah: or it may possibly have been originated as a new 100 rati coin, a decimal innovation on the primitive\n\n1 The name is written \u062f\u0644\u06cc \u0627\u0644 in Kutb-ud-din Aibek's inscription on the mosque at Dehli. (Prinsep's Essays, i. 327). The T\u00e1j-ul-Ma\u00fasir and other native authorities give the word as \u062f\u0647\u0644\u06cc\u0648\u0627\u0644. Hasan Niz\u00e1mi, the author of the former work, mentions that Kub\u00e1chah, ruler of Sind, sent his son with an offering of 100 laks of Dehli-w\u00e1ls to Altamsh, and no less than 500 laks of the same description of coin were eventually found in Kub\u00e1chah's treasury, many of which were probably struck in his own mints. (See Ariana Antiqua, pl. xx., fig. 19; J.A.S.B., iv., pl. 37, figs. 28, 29, 47; and Prinsep's Essays, i., pl. xxvi., figs. 28, 29, 47.)\n\nErskine derives this name from the Chagatai T\u00fcrki word, teng, \"white.\" (History of India under B\u00e1ber. London, 1854, vol. i. p. 546). Vullers gives a different and clearly preferable derivation in \u062a\u0646\u0647\u06a9 (fort. ex. \u062a\u0646\u0647\u06a9\u0647, suff. \u0629). Ibn Batutah carefully preserves the orthography as \u062a\u0646\u0647\u06a9\u0647, s. \u062a\u0646\u0647\u06a9\u0647 and \u062a\u0646\u0647\u06a9\u0647.\nHindu reckoning by fours, a point which remains to be determined by the correct ascertainment of the normal weight of the rati, which is still a debated question. My own results, obtained from comparative numismatic data of various ages, point to 1\u00b775 grains, while General\n\n1 In attempting to ascertain the relation of the weights of ancient and modern days, and to follow the changes that time and local custom may have introduced into the static laws of India, the capital point to be determined is the true weight of the rati, as it was understood and accepted when the initiatory metric system was in course of formation. Two different elements have hitherto obstructed any satisfactory settlement of the intrinsic measure of this primary unit\u2014the one, the irregularity of the weight of the gunja seeds themselves, which vary with localities and other incidental circumstances of growth; the other, the importance of which has been rather overlooked, that the modifications in the higher standards, introduced from time to time by despotic authority, were never accompanied by any rise or fall in the nominal total of ratios which went to form the altered integer. From these and other causes the rate of the rati has been variously estimated as \u2020 1\u00b73125 grains, 1\u00b7875 grains, 1\u00b7953 grains, and even as high as 2\u00b725 grains.\n\nWe have Manu's authority for the fact that 32 ratios went to the old silver dharmas or puranas, and we are instructed by his commentator, in a needlessly complicated sum, that the dhrama was composed of 80 ratios of copper. We have likewise seen that this karsha constituted a commercial static measure, its double character as a coin and as a weight being well calculated to ensure its fixity and uniformity in either capacity within the range of its circulation. I shall be able to show that this exact weight retained so distinct a place in the fiscal history of the metropolis of Hindustan, that in the revision and re-adjustment of the coinage which took place under Muhammad bin Tughlaq, in A.D. 1325, this integer was revived in the form of silver coin, and was further retained as a mint standard by his successors, till Shir Shah re-modelled the currency about the middle of the sixteenth century. In the same way I have already demonstrated elsewhere,\u2020 in illustration of an independent question, that a coin retaining with singular fidelity the ponderable ratio of the ancient purana, was concurrent with the restored karsha under Firuz Shah (A.D. 1351-1388) and other kings. And to complete the intermediate link, I may cite the fact that when the effects of Greek and Scythian interference had passed away, the 32-rati purana reappeared in the Punjab and Northern India, as the silver currency of the local dynasty of Syala and Samanta Deva,\u2021 and furnished in its style and devices the prototype of the Delhi Chohan series of \"Bull and Horseman\" coins, the Dehliidias, which were retained, unaltered in weight, by the Muhammadaus, in joint circulation with the silver double Dirhams of 174 grains of their own system.\u00a7\n\nExtant specimens of Syala's coins in the British Museum weigh 54\u00b74 grains and upwards.\n\nIf this double series of weights, extending over an interval of time represented by 24 or 25 centuries, and narrowed to an almost identical locality, are found not only to accord with exactitude in themselves, but to approach the only rational solution of the given quantities, the case may be taken as proved.\n\nThe ancient purana hall-marked silver pieces range as high as 55 grains; copper coins of Ramadatta\u00b6 are extant of 137\u00b75 grains; and other early coins of\n\n* Colebrooke, As.

I see that Mr. Thomas quotes Sir William Jones as fixing the weight of the Krishna, or Rati seed, at \\(1\\frac{1}{12}\\) grain; but I am satisfied that this is a simple misprint of Jones's manuscript for \\(1\\frac{1}{4}\\) or \\(1\\cdot833\\) grain, which is as nearly as possible the average weight of thousands of seeds which I have tested. The great unit of medi\u00e6val and modern times is the taka of not less than 145 grains, of which six make the chha-taka, or chhatak, equal to 870 grains, or nearly two ounces; and 100 make the sataka, or ser, the derivation being sat-taka, or 100 takas. For convenience I have taken, in all my calculations, the rati seed at 1.8229 grain. Then 80 ratios or 145.832 was the weight of the tangka of copper, and also of the golden sarvana, which multiplied by six gives 874.99 grains, or exactly two ounces for the chhadaka or chhatak.\"\u2014J.A.S. Bengal, 1865, page 46.\n\nMr. N. S. Maskelyne, of the Mineral Department, British Museum, who, some time ago, entered into an elaborate series of comparisons of Oriental weights, with a view to determine the identity of one of our most celebrated Indian diamonds, has been so obliging as to draw up for me the following memorandum, exhibiting the bearing of an entirely independent set of data upon the question under review, the true weight of the Indian Rati. The value of this contribution in itself, and the difficulty of doing justice to it in an abstract, must plead my excuse for printing it in extenso in this place:\n\nI shall confine my answer to your question about the rati to the estimate of it as derived from the Mishk\u00e2l. The other channel of enquiry, that namely of Hindoo metrology and numismatics, is too complicated, and so far as I have been able to follow it, too unsatisfactory in its results, to justify my urging any arguments derived from it. Indeed, the oscillations in the currencies, and our knowing so few very fine coins of reigns before Shir Sh\u00e2h, of critical value, make this branch of the subject almost unapproachable to one who is not an Oriental scholar. I would premise, however, that I do not believe very accurate results are to be obtained solely from the weights of coins, except in the few cases where, as in the coins of Akbar, or of Abd-al-Malek ben Merwan, we have some literary\nHowever, these silver coins of Altamsh\u2014let their primary static ideal have been based upon a duplication of the dirhams statements about them. Nor can you get any result from weighing carob beans to determine the carat, or abrus seeds to determine the rati. I weighed, long ago, hundreds of ratis, that Dr. Daubeney lent me, with an average of 1.694 troy grains. Sir William Jones found, I believe, one of 1.318, and Professor Wilson, I think, another value again. They vary according to the soil and climate they are grown in, and the time and atmosphere they have been kept in.\n\nMy investigation of the rati originated in a desire to determine whether the diamond, now the Queen's, was the same that Baber records as having been given to Humayun at the taking of Agra, after the battle of Paniput, and which had once belonged to Al\u00e1-ed-din (Khilji). I also was led to suppose that the diamond Tavernier saw at the Court of Aurungzebe was the same, and that he had confounded it with one that Meer Jumla gave to Shah Jehan, and that had been recently found at Golconda. I would here observe that Tavernier's weights can be very little trusted; I can give you my reasons for this assertion, if you wish for them.\n\nBaber, in his memoirs, says the weight of Humayun's diamond, was about 8 mishkals. In his description of India, he gives the following ratios of the weights in use there:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n8 \\text{ ratis} &= 1 \\text{ m\u00e1shah}, \\\\\n32 \\text{ \"} &= 4 \\text{ \" } = 1 \\text{ tang (tank)}, \\\\\n40 \\text{ \"} &= 5 \\text{ \" } = 1 \\text{ mishkal}, \\\\\n96 \\text{ \"} &= 12 \\text{ \" } = 1 \\text{ tola}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nJewels and precious stones being estimated by the tang. Furthermore he states 14 tolas = 1 sir, 40 sirs = 1 man, etc. Thus, then, the 8 mishkals would be 320 ratis.\n\nTavernier says the diamond he saw weighed 3194 ratis. The Koh-i-Nur, in 1851 (and, I believe, in Baber's day also), weighed 589.5 grains troy. The theory that it was Al\u00e1-ed-din's diamond, would demand\u2014\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{a mishkal (8)} & \\text{ weight of } 73.7 \\text{ grains}, \\\\\n\\text{a tola (3)} & \\text{ \" } 176.85 \\text{ \" }, \\\\\n\\text{a tank (10)} & \\text{ \" } 58.95 \\text{ \" }, \\\\\n\\text{a m\u00e1sha (40)} & \\text{ \" } 14.745 \\text{ \" }, \\\\\n\\text{a rati (320 of 8 to the m\u00e1sha)} & \\text{ \" } 1.8425 \\text{ \" }, \\\\\n\\text{\u2014\u2014 (240 of 6 \" )} & \\text{ \" } 2.533 \\text{ \" }.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNow, as to the mishkal\u2014the Mahommadan writers speak of it as not having altered from the days of the Prophet. Doubtless, it has been a pretty permanent weight, and very likely, in Makrizi's time, was but slightly various in different places. At present, the following table represents the different mishkals, so far as I have been able to ascertain them.\n\nThe gold and silver mishkal of Bassorah \\(= \\frac{1}{4}\\) dirham \\(= 72\\) grains.\n\nThe \\(= 100\\) mahmoudias \\(= 5136\\) grains \\(= 71.6\\).\n\nThe gold and silver miscal of Mocha \\(= 24\\) carats \\(= 24 \\frac{1}{100}\\) vakya (of 480 grains, nearly) \\(= 72\\).\n\nThat of Bushire \\(= \\frac{1}{120}\\) of a maund of 53784 grains \\(= 74.7\\).\n\nThe metical of Aleppo and Algiers \\(= 78\\).\n\nThe \\(= 1\\) of Tripoli \\(= 73.6\\).\n\nIn Persian, the demi mishkal \\(= \\frac{1}{100}\\) of the batman of Chessay (of 8871 grains) \\(= 73.96\\).\n\nThe taurod batman and mishkal \\(= \\frac{1}{2}\\) above\n\nThe mishkal corresponding to the (\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)) dirham used for gold and silver, in Persia \\(= 74.5\\).\n\nThe abassi corresponding to 1 mishkal, Maraden says \\(= 73\\).\n\nThe modern debased mishkal of Bokhara \\(= 71\\).\n\nBaber, in speaking of the mishkal, may either mean his own Bokharam mishkal, or, as seems more probable, the current mishkal as existing at that time in India;\nof Ghazn\u00ed, or, as is more probable, elaborated out of the elements of ancient Indian Metrology\u2014may be quoted in their\n\nshort, the \"Indian or Syrian mishk\u00e2l\" of the Mahommadan writers\u2014which was the Greek mishk\u00e2l + 2 kirats. The modern debased mishk\u00e2l of Bokhara we may leave out of our comparisons. It is surely a degraded weight in a country that has undergone an eclipse.\n\nThe old \"Greek Dinar\" is of course the Byzant, or solidus aureus\u2014the denarius of Byzantium. It was nominally coined 72 to the Roman lb. The Byzantine Roman lb, in the British Museum weighs 4995 grains, so the solidus was nominally coined at 69.4 grains. It really issued from the mint at a maximum weight of 68 (a very few of the most finely preserved coins reaching this amount). Now taking Makrizi's statement that the mishk\u00e2l was 2 kirats, and that of the Ayin-i-Akberi that the Greek mishk\u00e2l was 2 kirats less than this; we find the weight of the mishk\u00e2l = 68 + \\(\\frac{1}{11}\\) = 74.18 grains troy. Again, Makrizi mentions that Abd-el-malek ben Merwan coined dinars and dirhams in the ratios of 21\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) kirats : 15 kirats. Now this Caliph's gold coins in the British Museum (in a very fine state of preservation), weigh 66.5 grains, and his silver, also well preserved, 44.5. Taking the former as coined at 67, we have the ratio:\n\n\\[ \\text{Dinar} : \\text{Dirham} = 21\\frac{1}{2} : 15 = 67 : 46.2, \\]\n\nwhich latter gives a probable weight for the dirham as originally coined. (In Makrizi's time the ratio was dinar : dirham = 10 : 7 = 21.75 : 15.22; or supposing the gold coin unchanged at 67, the silver dirham would become 46.88). Then, as the ratio of the dinar (or gold mishk\u00e2l) to the mishk\u00e2l weight = 21\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) : 24 we have for the mishk\u00e2l weight a value of 73.93 grains.\n\nThese two values, thus severally adduced from different data\u2014viz., 74.18 and 73.93\u2014sufficiently nearly accord to justify, I think, our striking the balance between them, and declaring the ancient mishk\u00e2l\u2014\"the Syrian or Indian mishk\u00e2l\") to have been very nearly 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) grains. Hence the kirat would be 3.133 grains, troy. The modern carat varies from 3.15, the modern Indian carat, to 3.28, the old French carat (made thus probably to be an aliquot part of the old French ounce). The English carat = 3.168; the Hamburgh = 3.176, and the Portuguese = 3.171.\n\nThe above value of the mishk\u00e2l accords extremely well with my theory about the diamond.\n\nThat the \"Greek Dinar\" of Makrizi was the Sassanian gold is not at all likely, although the silver dirham was, no doubt, originally derived from the Sassanian drachma. Of the few gold pieces of Sassanian coinage, the one in the Museum, of Ardashir I., weighs now 65.5, and could not have been coined at less than 66.5 grains\u2014which would give a mishk\u00e2l of 72.04. But under the Sassanids, the gold coinage was quite exceptional, and was not large enough to have formed the basis of the monetary system of the Caliphs, which was professedly founded on Greek coins, current.\n\nAs to the Bokh\u00e2ran mishk\u00e2l of B\u00e2ber's time, how are we to arrive at it? You\u2014and if you can't, who can?\u2014are able to make little firm ground out of the weights of Sassanian, or Ghasnavid coins\u2014nor will the coins of the Ayubite, Mamluke, and Mamluke Bahrite, Caliphs (of which I have weighed scores), give any much more reliable units on which to base the history of the progress of change in the mishk\u00e2l. The limits of its variation in modern times seem to have lain between 74.5 and 72 troy grains; I believe 74 as near as possible its true original weight, the weight of the Syrian and of the Indian mishk\u00e2l. This would give the rati on the goldsmith's standard of 8 to the m\u00e2sha, and 40 to the mishk\u00e2l, as 1.85 grains, and the limits of this rati would be 1.862 and 1.80.\n\nThe value of the jeweller's rati (6 to the m\u00e2sha) would be for the 74 grain mishk\u00e2l 2.47 grains, and its limits would be 2.483 and 2.40.\n\nThat B\u00e2ber's and Hum\u00e2y\u00fbn's now worn and dilapidated coins of 71 and 71.5 grains were mishk\u00e2ls is not improbable; but they certainly were not coined at less than 74 grains.\n\nWithout entering into the Indian numismatical question, I may remind you of\nsurviving integrity of weight and design, as having furnished\nthe prototypes of a long line of sequent Dehli mintages, and\nthus contributing the manifest introductory model of all\nBengal coinages.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe artistic merits of the produce of the southern mints,\n\nTuglak's coin of 174 grains (one in the British Museum = 172.25), probably\ncoined at 176 or 178; a fair weight of issue for a coin nominally of some 177 or\n178 grains. These coins, I believe, you consider to represent the tola. A tola\nof 177.6 would accord on the ratios of B\u00e4ber's table with a miskill of 74 grains.\nI am strongly tempted to enter further into this question of the ponderary\nsystems of India, but I am warned by your own able papers of the difficulties\nin the path of one who deals only in translations and in the weight of coins.\n\n24th Nov., 1865.\n\n\\(^1\\) There are three varieties of Altamsh's silver coinage, all showing more or\nless the imperfection of the training of the Indian artists in the reproduction of\nthe official alphabet of their conquerors. The designs of these pieces were clearly\ntaken from the old Ghazni model of Muhammad bin Sim's Dirhams and\nDinars, and the indeterminate form of the device itself would seem to indicate\nthat they mark the initial effort of the new Muhammedan silver currency which\nso soon fixed itself into one unvarying type, and retained its crude and unim-\nproved lettering for upwards of a century, till Muhammad bin Tughlak inaugu-\nrated his reign by the issue of those choice specimens of the Moneyer's art,\nwhich stand without competitors in the Dehli series.\n\nNo. 1, Silver.

The lowest scale of die execution, exemplified in the present series, was reserved for the capital of the united provinces under the kingship of Sikandar (No. 22 infra). The numismatic innovations of Muhammad bin Tughlak were felt and copied in the south, especially in the reproduction of the titular legends; but his own coins struck at the \"city\"\u2014he would not call it capital\u2014of Lakhnauti, evince the haste and carelessness of a temporary sojourn, and still worse, the hand of a local artist, all of which shortcomings may be forgiven to a monarch who, in his own imperial metropolis, had raised the standard of the beauties of Arabic writing, as applied to coin legends, to a position it had never before attained, and which later improved appliances have seldom succeeded in equalling.\n\nThe Bengal Sultans, mere imitators at first, were original in their later developments of coin illumination, and the issues of the fully independent kings exhibit a commendable variety of patterns in the die devices, damaged and restricted, however, in the general effect by the pervading coarseness and imperfection of the forms of the letters. Then, again, the tenor of the inscriptions is usually of independent conception, especially in the refusal to adopt the ever recurring kalimah, and in\nthe suggestive mutations of titles assigned to the lieutenants of\nthe prophet on earth, whose names they did not care to learn.\nSo also was their elaboration of the titular adjuncts of the\nfour Im\u00e1ms uninfluenced by northern formul\u00e6; many of\nwhich conventionalisms survived for centuries, till Sh\u00edr Sh\u00e1h,\nin the chances of conquest, incorporated them into the coinage\nof Hindust\u00e1n, during the exile of the temporarily vanquished\nHum\u00e1y\u00fan.\n\nThe standard of the Bengal coinage was necessarily, like\nthe pieces themselves, a mere imitation of imperial mint\nquantities, and the early issues will be seen to follow closely\nupon the proper amount in weight contemplated in the Dehli\nprototypes; but one of the curious results the Kooch Beh\u00e1r\ncollective find determines is, that, though the first kings on\nthe list clearly put forth money of full measure, their pieces\nwere, in most cases, subjected to a well understood Indian\nprocess of boring-out, or reduction to the exact weight to\nwhich we must suppose subsequent kings lowered the legal\nstandard of their money, so that, although some of the silver\npieces of Kai K\u00e1\u00fas and Fir\u00faz have escaped the debaser's eye,\nand preserve the completeness of their original issue denomi-\nnation, the great majority of the older coins have been brought\ndown to the subsequent local standard of 166 grains, at which\nfigure, in troy grains, the bulk of the hoard ranges, or, in more\nmarked terms, 166 grains is the precise weight of the majority\nof the very latest and best preserved specimens, which must\nhave been consigned to their recent place of concealment when\nvery fresh from mints but little removed from the residence of\nthe accumulator of the treasure, and be held to represent coin\nwhich could scarcely have changed hands.\n\nThe intrinsic value of the money of these sovereigns follows\nnext in the order of the enquiry. This department of fiscal\nadministration might naturally have been expected to have\nbeen subject to but limited check or control, when regulated\nby the uncertain processes of Oriental metallurgy; but, in\npractice, it will be seen that some of the native Mint-masters\nwere able to secure a very high standard of purity, and, what\nis more remarkable, to maintain a singularly uniform scale in\nthe rate of alloy. In the case of the imperial coins subjected to assay in Calcutta, specimens spreading over, and in so far, representing a sequent eighty years of the issues of the northern metropolis, vary only to the extent of six grains in the thousand, or 0.6 per cent. As the Dehli coinage proves superior, in point of weight, to the southern standard, so also does it retain a higher degree of purity; the 990 and 996 of silver to the test total of 1,000 grains, sinks, in the earliest examples of the Bengal mintage, to 989, from which figures it experiences a temporary rise, in possibly exceptional cases, under Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, who may be supposed to have brought down, with his reinstituted honors and the coined treasure so lavishly bestowed upon him by Muhammad bin Tughlak on his restoration to the government of Sonargaon, certain implied responsibilities for the equity and fulness of his currencies; while in the subsequent irregularly descending scale, A\u00e1zam Sh\u00e1h\u2019s officials arrived at the most unblushing effort of debasement, in the reduction of silver to 962 grains. Among other unexpected items for which the aid of modern science may be credited, is the support which the intrinsic contents of the erroneously-classed coins of \u2019\u00c1d\u00edl Sh\u00e1h under native interpretation, lend to the correctness of the revised attribution of the pieces themselves suggested by the critical terms of their own legends, in the manifest identity of their assay touch with the associate coins of the lower empire of India.\n\nColonel Guthrie has furnished me with the following data, concerning the assay of the various coins composing the Kooch Bah\u00e1r hoard:\u2014\u201cWhen the Bengal Asiatic Society made their selection of coins from the trove, they set apart four of each description for the Mint, two being for special assay, two for the Mint collection.

Numismatists have been for long past in a position to assert that the Dehli Tankah contained absolutely 173 grains, which would presuppose a theoretical issue weight of 174 or 175 grains, and a touch of nearly pure silver; but assuming this specific coin to have been a white or real \"Tankah of Silver\" (\u062a\u06a9\u0647 \u0646\u0642\u0631\u0647), a doubt necessarily remained as to what was to be understood by the alternative black Tankah (\u062a\u06a9\u0647 \u0633\u06cc\u0627\u062f). Niz\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn Ahmad, in his Tabak\u00e1t-i-Akbari, seems to assign the introduction of these black Tankahs to Muhammad bin Tughlak, who notoriously depreciated the currency to a large extent, before he resorted to the extreme measure of a forced currency, though it may be doubted whether any such depreciation would have been thought of, even if there had been time to effect the conversion, at the very commencement of his reign, to which period Niz\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn attributes the issue of these pieces, in the apparent desire of explaining the bare possibility of the possession of such numerical amounts as are stated to have been squandered in largesses by the newly-enthroned monarch. However, the real debasement of the coin need not have extended much beyond the point indicated by the superficial aspect of his own Bengal mintage, and A\u00e1zam Sh\u00e1h's coins of the same locality probably exceed that accusatory measure of debasement; while, on the other hand, Muhammad bin Tughlak, on reverting to specie currencies, after his futile trial of copper tokens, seems to have aimed at a restoration of the ancient purity of metal in his metropolitan issues, as I can quote a coin of his produced by the Dehli Mint in A.H. 734, which has every outward appearance of a sole component element of unalloyed silver, and equally retains the fair average weight of 168 grains.\u00b9 All\n\n\u00b9 This coin is similar, but not identical in its legends with the gold piece,\nthese evidences would seem to imply that the Bengal ratio of parity was intentionally lower, and that a very slight addition to the recognised alloy would bring the local issues fairly within the category of \"black Tankahs.\" Such a supposition of the inferiority of the coinages of the southern kingdom appears to be curiously illustrated by B\u00e1ber's mentioning that, in A.H. 932, a portion of the revenues of the district of T\u00edrh\u00fat, a sort of border-land of his kingdom, which did not extend over Bengal, was payable in Tankah Nukrah, and the larger remainder in Tankah S\u00edkh, an exceptional association of currencies in a given locality, which can scarcely be explained in a more simple and reasonable manner than by assuming the lower description of the conventional estimate piece to have been concurrent with a better description of the same coin, constituting the prevailing and authorized revenue standard of the northern portions of the conquering Moghul's Indian dominions.\n\nAnother important element of all currency questions is the relative rate of exchange of the precious metals inter se. And this is a division of the enquiry of peculiar significance at the present moment, when Her Majesty's Government are under pressure by the European interest to introduce gold as a legal tender at a fixed and permanent rate, or, in effect, to supersede the existing silver standard, the single and incontestable measure of value, in which all modern obligations have been contracted, and a metal, whose present market price is, in all human probability, less liable to be affected by\n\nNo. 84, of 736 A.H., p. 50, Path\u00e1n Sult\u00e1ns.

It was a crude but established custom among the early Muhammadan occupying conquerors of India, to issue gold and silver coins of equal weights, identical fabric, and analogous central legends; hence, whenever, as in the present instance, the word Din\u0101r is used in apposition with and contrast to the secondary term Dirham, the one prim\u0101 facie implies gold, the other silver; and there can be little doubt but that the original design of the text was to specify that one gold piece of a given weight passed in situ for eight silver pieces of similar form and of slightly greater bulk. It is possible that the term Din\u0101r may in process of time have come to stand for a conventional measure of value, like the \"pound sterling,\" susceptible by common consent of being liquidated in the due equivalent of silver; but this concession need not affect the direct contrast between the Din\u0101rs and Dirhams so obviously marked in the case in point.\n\nIbn Batutah in an earlier part of his work (iii. 426) [Lee's edition is imperfect at this portion, p. 149] gives us the comparative Delhi rate of exchange\u2014of which he had unpleasant personal experiences: he relates that he was directed to be paid (55,000 + 12,000 = 67,000 pieces of some well understood currency neither the name or the metal of which is defined, but which may legitimately be taken to have been \"Silver Tankahs,\" and in satisfaction of this amount, deducting the established one-tenth of Das\u016bri, which left a reduced total of 60,300, he received 6,283 gold tankahs. Under this scale of payment the gold must have borne a rate of exchange of one to 9-67 of silver, or very nearly one to 10. a proportion which might be supposed to clash with the one to eight of the more northern kingdom, but the existing state of the currencies of the two localities afford a striking illustration of the consistency of the African observer's appreciation of money values in either case. His special patron, Muhammad bin Tughlak, Emperor of Delhi, had, from his first elevation to the throne, evinced a tendency to tamper with the currency, departing very early in his reign from the traditional equality of weights of gold and silver coins; he re-modelled both forms and relative proportions, introducing pieces of 200 grains of gold, styled on their surfaces din\u0101rs, and silver coins of 140 grains, designated as adalis, in supersession of the ancient equable tankahs, both of gold and silver, extant examples of which in either metal come up to about 174 grains. More important for the present issue is the practical result, that, from the very commencement, Muhammad Tughlak's silver money is invariably of a lower standard than that of his predecessors, whether this refers to the early continuation of the full silver tankah, or to his own newly devised 140 grain piece, a mere reproduction of the time-honoured local weight, which the Aryan races found current in the land some twenty-five centuries before this Moslem revival, but in either case, this payment to Ibn Batutah seems to have been made after the Sultan had organised and abandoned that imaginary phase of perfection in the royal art of depreciating the circulating media, by the entire supercession of the precious metals, and following the ideal of a paper currency, the substitution of a copper simulacrum of each and every piece in the\nThe Emperor Akbar's minister, Ab\u00fal Fazl, has left an official record of the value of gold in the second half of the sixteenth century, at which period the price was on the rise, so that the mints were issuing gold coin in the relation of one to 9\u00b74 of silver. But a remarkable advance must have taken place about this time, as in the second moiety of the seventeenth century, Tavernier\\(^1\\) found gold exchanging against fourteen times its weight of silver, from which point it gradually advanced to one to fifteen, a rate it maintained when the East India Company re-modelled the coinage in 1833.\\(^2\\) Afterwards, with prospering times, the metal ran up occasionally to fabulous premiums, to fall again ignominiously, when Californian and Australian discoveries made it common in the land.\n\nI revert for the moment to a more formal recapitulation of the computations, which serve to establish the ratios of gold and silver in Akbar's time.\n\nAb\u00fal Fazl's figured returns give the following results:\n\nFirst.\u2014Chugal, weight in gold Tolah 3, M\u00e1sha 0, Rati \\(5\\frac{1}{4} = 30\\) Rs. of \\(11\\frac{1}{2}\\) M\u00e1shas each : \\(549\\cdot84 :: 172\\cdot5 \\times 30 (5175\\cdot0)\\) : \\(1::9\\cdot4118\\).\n\nSecond.\u2014Aft\u00e1b\u00ed, gold, weight t. 1, m. 2, r. \\(4\\frac{3}{4}=12\\) Rs. : \\(218\\cdot90 :: 172\\cdot5 \\times 12 (2070\\cdot0)\\) : \\(1::9\\cdot4563\\).\n\norder of its degree from the Dindr to the lowest coin in the realm, the values being authoritatively designated on the surface of each. This forced currency held its own, more or less successfully from 730 to 733, when it came to a simple and self-developed end. Taking the probable date of this payment as 742-3 A.H. (Ibn, B. vi., p. 4, and vol. iii., p. xxii.), it may be assumed that the 174 (or 175) grain old gold tankah, which had heretofore stood at the equitable exchange of one to eight tunkas of good silver, came necessarily, in the depreciation of the new silver coins, to be worth ten or more of the later issues.

My original estimates were sketched and published at Dehli, in 1851, where I had access to the best MSS., to the most comprehensive range of antiquarian relics, and at command the most intelligent oral testimony in the land. When reprinting Prinsep\u2019s \u201cUseful Tables\u201d (London, 1858), I had occasion to quote these calculations, and was able to fortify them, had it been needed, by the precisely analogous\n\n\u00b9 Jour.

Gladwin\u2019s MSS. gave the rupee at 11\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) m\u00e1shas (i. p. 34). The more carefully collated Dehli texts showed the real weight to be 11\\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) m\u00e1shas, a static fact of some importance, which is curiously susceptible of proof from Gladwin\u2019s own data: at page 46 of his Calcutta edition, a sum is given of the refining charges and profits, as understood by the mints of those days, wherein 989 tolas, 9 m\u00e1shas of impure silver is stated to be reduced by 14 r. 9 m. 1 r. in refining, and a further 4 r. 10 m. 3 r. in manipulation, leaving 11641 m\u00e1shas of silver (989. 9. 0. \u2014 14. 9. 1. \u2014 4. 10. 3. = 11641) which is officially announced as ordinarily coined into 1012 rupees, \\((1012 \\times 115 = 11638)\\) giving, as nearly as may be, the essential 11\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) m\u00e1shas, which the translated text should have preserved in its earlier passages.\n\nRichard Hawkins, who was at Agra, in A.D. 1609-11, during the reign of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, has left a notice of certain accumulated treasures of that prince which he was permitted to behold, and amongst the rest he specifies \u201cIn primis of Seraffins Ecberi, which be ten rupias apiece;\u201d to this passage is added in a marginal note, that, \u201ca tole is a rupia challany [current] of silver, and ten of these toles are of the value of one of gold.\u201d\\(^4\\) This evidence might at first sight seem to militate against the conclusion arrived at from the official\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) U.T., vol. ii., p. 32.  \n\\(^2\\) Gladwin, i. 44.  \n\\(^3\\) 4to., Calcutta, 1783.  \n\\(^4\\) Purchas\u2019 Travels, folio, 1625-26, i. 217.\nreturns above summarized, but the value of gold was clearly on the rise, and one of the aims of Akbar's legislation on metallic exchanges, which had necessarily been disturbed by progressive modifications in the relative values of the precious metals, was manifestly to secure an authoritative even reckoning by tens and hundreds. The old round *muhar*, (No. 4 of the above list) represented the inconvenient sum of nine rupees, or 360 *d\u00e1ms*; by raising the weight of the piece to the higher total given under No. 3, the gold *ilahi* was made equivalent to ten rupees, or in fiscal reckoning to 400 *d\u00e1ms*. Similarly, in the case of the silver coin, the old rupee passed for 39 *d\u00e1ms*; in the new currency a value of 40 *d\u00e1ms* was secured, not by an increase of weight, but by the declared and doubtlessly achieved higher standard of the metal employed, aided by the advantage that contemporary mintages so readily secured in India.\n\nThe subdivisions of the standard silver Tankah, as well as the relative exchange ratios of silver and copper in their subordinate denominations, claim a passing notice. Though Bengal proper probably remained satisfied with its lower currency of cowries, supplemented by the occasional intervention of copper, for some time after the introduction of gold and silver money, yet as the earliest copper coins of that kingdom must have been based upon and, in the first instance, supplied by Delhi mintages, the Imperial practice comes properly within the range of the local division of the general enquiry.\n\nIt has been seen that Minh\u00e1j-ul-Sir\u00e1j, in comparing the circulating media of Hindust\u00e1n and Bengal, speaks of the currency of the former as composed of *Chitals*, a name which is seemingly used by himself and succeeding authors in the generic sense for money, as if these pieces continued to constitute the popular standard both in theory and practice, notwithstanding the introduction of the more imposing *tankahs* of gold and silver. Up to this time it has not been possible satisfactorily to demonstrate the actual value of the coin in question; in some cases indirect evidence would seem to bring its intrinsic worth down to a very low point; while, at times, the money calculations for large sums, in which its name\nalone is used, appear to invest it with a metrical position far beyond the subordinate exchanges of mere baz\u0101r traffic.\n\nIn the details of the \"prices-current\" in the reign of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Muhammad, as well as in the relation of certain monetary re-adjustments made by F\u00edruz Sh\u00e1h III., the name of the Chital is constantly associated in the definition of comparative values with another subdivision entitled the K\u00e1n\u00ed, which may now be pronounced with some certainty to have been the $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the original Tankah, of 175 grains, and $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the new silver coin of 140 grains, introduced by Muhammad bin Tughlak. The temporary forced currency of this Sult\u00e1n necessitated in itself the positive announcement of the names, and authoritative equivalents of each representative piece, and in this abnormal practice contributes many items towards the elucidation of the quantitative constitution of the real currency of the day, which these copper tokens were designed to replace. In illustration of this point, I insert a woodcut and description of a brass coin, which was put forth to pass for the value of the silver piece of 140 grains, to whose official weight it is seemingly suggestively approximated.\n\nBrass; weight, 132 grs.; A.H. 731; Common.\n\nObverse.\u2014Struck (lit. sealed), a tankah of fifty k\u00e1nis in the reign of the servant, hopeful (of mercy), Muhammad Tughlak.\n\nReverse.\u2014Area, \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0637\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0642\u062f \u0627\u0637\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646. \"He who obeys the king, truly he obeys God.\"\n\nMargin, \u062f\u0631 \u062e\u062a \u06a9\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0648\u0644\u062a \u0627\u0628\u0627\u062f \u0633\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u0631 \u0647\u0641\u0635\u062f \u0633\u06cc \u06cc\u06a9.

An obverse of the latter is given in the margin.

In Telugu, kuni means \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), or one quarter of a sixteenth\" (Brown). In Canarese \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) (Reeve), and in Tamil \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) (Winslow). Wilson's Glossary gives \"Kani, corruptly, Cawney. Tel.Tam.Karn.\\( \\frac{1}{6} \\), or sometimes \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\).\" \\(^2\\)\n\nThe term kani, in addition to its preferable meaning of \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\), was, as we see, also used for the fraction \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\), but its application in the former sense to the ruling integer in the present instance, seems to be conclusively settled by the relative proportions assigned to the modified tankah of Muhammad bin Tughlak, when compared with the normal weight of the earlier coin (: 64 :: 175 : 50 :: 136\u00b7718).\n\nThe method in which the subdivisional currency was arranged, consisted, as has already been stated, of an admixture of the two metals, silver and copper, in intentionally varying proportions in pieces of identical weight, shape and device; so that the traders in each case had to judge by the eye and hand of the intrinsic value of the coin presented to them. To European notions this system would imply endless doubt and uncertainty, but under the practiced vision and delicate perceptive powers of touch, with which the natives of India are endowed, but little difficulty seems to have been experi-\n\n\\(^1\\) Num.

of Manu have preserved a record, reproduced in the subjoined table, of the various weights in use, some centuries before Christ, and among other things explain, that the values of gold and copper, were calculated by a different metric scheme, to that applied to silver. A larger number of Ratis went to the M\u00e1sha in the former, and the progression of numbers commenced with a five (5 \u00d7 16), while the silver estimates were founded on the simple arithmetic of fours (2 \u00d7 16), which constituted so special a characteristic of India's home civilization. Still, the two sets of tables starting from independent bases, were very early assimilated and adapted to each other in the advancing totals, so that the 320 ratis constituting the satam\u00e1na of the quaternary multiplication, is created in the third line by the use of a ten, and the quasi exotic scheme corrects its independent elements by multiplying by four, and produces a similar total in the contents of the Pala or Nishka. The second lines of the tables are severally filled in with the aggregate numbers, 32 and 80, and as the duplication of the former, or 64, has\n\n---\n\n1 Manu, viii. 131.\u2014\"Those names of copper, silver, and gold (weights) which are commonly used among men for the purpose of worldly business, I will now comprehensively explain. 132.\u2014The very small mote which may be discerned in a sunbeam passing through a lattice is the first of quantities, and men call it a trasarenu. 133.\u2014Eight of those trasarenu are supposed equal in weight to one minute poppy-seed (likha), three of those seeds are equal to one black mustard-seed (r\u00e1jasearshapa), and three of these last to a white mustard-seed (gaura-sarshapa). 134.\u2014Six white mustard-seeds are equal to a middle-sized barley-corn (yava), three such barley-corns to one krshnala [raktika], five krshnalas of gold are one m\u00e1sha, and sixteen such m\u00e1shalas one suvarna. 135.\u2014Four suvarnas make a pala, ten palas a dharana, but two krshnalas weighed together are considered as one silver m\u00e1sha. 136.\u2014Sixteen of those m\u00e1shalas are a silver dharana or pur\u00e1na, but a copper krshna is known to be a pana or krshh\u00e1pana. 137.\u2014Ten dharanas of silver are known by the name of a satam\u00e1na, and the weight of four suvarnas has also the appellation of a nishka.\" These statements may be tabulated thus as the\n\n### ANCIENT INDIAN SYSTEM OF WEIGHTS.\n\n#### SILVER.\n\n| Ratios | M\u00e1sa |\n|--------|------|\n| 2      | 1    |\n\n| Ratios | Dharana or Pur\u00e1na |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| 32     | 1                 |\n| 320    | 10                |\n\n| Ratios | Satam\u00e1na |\n|--------|----------|\n| 320    | 1        |\n\n#### GOLD.\n\n| Ratios | M\u00e1sa |\n|--------|------|\n| 5      | 1    |\n\n| Ratios | Suvarna |\n|--------|---------|\n| 80     | 1       |\n\n| Ratios | Pala or Nishka |\n|--------|----------------|\n| 320    | 4           |\n| 3200   | 40          |\n\n#### COPPER.\n\n| Ratios | Karsh\u00e1pana |\n|--------|------------|\n| 80     | 1          |\nbeen seen to do duty in the one case, the probability of the use of the 160 naturally suggests itself in connexion with the theoretical organization of the copper coinage.\n\nIn proceeding to test the relations of the minor and subordinate currencies, the cardinal point to be determined is, the exchangeable value of copper as against silver. It has been affirmed by Colebrooke,\\(^1\\) that the ratio stood in Manu's time at 64 to 1: accepting the correctness of this estimate, which has, I believe, remained unchallenged, and supposing the rate to have remained practically but little affected up to the Muhammadan conquest, the 175 grains of silver of Altamsh's new coinage, would be equivalent in metallic value to 11,200 grains of copper. The ancient copper k\u00e1rs\u00e1pa\u1e47a is recognised and defined as 80 ratis in weight, so that under the above conditions, and calculating the rati at 1\u00b775 grains, each k\u00e1rs\u00e1pa\u1e47a was equal to 140 grains, and eighty of these, under the same calculations, give a return of 11,200 grains. Without at present advancing any more definite proposition, or quoting dubious coincidences, it may be as well to test these preliminary results by the Numismatic data F\u00edr\u00faz Sh\u00e1h's Mints have left as an heritage behind him. Among the incidents quoted regarding that monarch's monetary innovations, he is stated to have introduced, for the first time, half and quarter Chitals. On the occasion of a very elaborate revision of my monograph on the Path\u00e1n Sult\u00e1ns of Dehli, while residing under the very shadow of so many of their memorial edifices, I acquired and described, among others, two specimens of the money of this king, which seemed to be closely identifiable with his Utopian productions of new and infinitesimal subdivisions of the leading copper coinage, in his expressed desire of securing for the poorest of the poor, the fractional change they might be entitled to in the most limited purchases.\\(^2\\) These coins responded singularly in their mutual proportions, and contributed in the form of once\n\n\\(^1\\) As.

If the 34\u00b78 grain of the first of these be multiplied by 160, it will give a return of 5568\u00b70 grains, and accepting this trial piece, conditionally, as Firuz\u2019s novel half-Chital, it will be seen to furnish a general total of 11,136 grains for the copper equivalent of the 175 grains of silver contained in the old Tankah, and confirms the range of the Chital at 69\u00b76 grains, or only \u20184 short of the full contents tradition would assign it, as the unchanged half k\u00e1rsh\u00e1pa\u1e47a of primitive ages. To pass to the opposite extreme for a test of the copper exchange rate, it is found that when Sh\u00edr Sh\u00e1h reorganised the northern coinage of Hindust\u00e1n, by the lights of\n\nThe original and unique MS., from which the above passage is extracted, is in the possession of the Naw\u00e1b Z\u00eds-ud-d\u00edn of Loh\u00e1r\u00fa, in the Delhi territory.\n\n1 I once supposed these two coins to be whole and half Chitals, instead of the half and quarter pieces now adopted.\n\n2 It may be as well to state distinctly that the most complete affirmation of the numismatic existence of a Chital of a given weight and value, supported even by all anterior written testimony, in no wise detracts from the subsequent and independent use of the name for the purposes of account, a confusion which perchance may have arisen from the traditional permanency of the term itself, which\nhis southern experience, and swept away all dubious combinations of metals, reducing the copper standard to its severe chemical element; his Mint statistics show that the 178 grains of silver, constituting his revised Tankah, exchanged against 40 d\u00e0ms, or quadrupled chitals of copper, of an ascertained weight of 323\u00b75 grains each, producing in all a total of 12,940 grains of the latter metal, as the equivalent of 178 grains of silver, or in the ratio of 72\u00b769 to 1; though, even in the altered weights and modified proportions, still retaining inherent traces of the old scheme of fours, in the half d\u00e0m of 80, and the quarter d\u00e0m of 160 to the new \"Rupee.\"\n\nin either case might eventually have been used to represent higher or lower values than that which originally belonged to it. Z\u00ee\u00e2-i-Barn\u00ee at one moment seems to employ the term as a fractional fifteenth of the Tankah, while in other parts of the same or similar documents he quotes a total of \"sixty Chitals,\" and in his statement of progressive advances of price, mentions the rise from twenty Chitals to half a Tankah. Ferishtah following, with but vague knowledge, declares that fifty Chitals constituted the Tankah; while Ab\u00fbl Fazl, who had real information on these matters as understood in his own day, asserts that the d\u00e0m was divided \"in account\" into twenty-five Chitals. (See Suppl. Path\u00e2n Sult\u00e2ns, p. 31; N.C. xv. 156; Ferishtah, p. 299; Gladwin A.A., L. p. 36.) Then again there seems to have been some direct association between Chitals and K\u00e2nis, as General Cunningham has published a coin which he as yet has only partially deciphered, bearing the word \u062c\u06cc\u0644 on the one side, and \u067e\u06a9\u0627\u0646\u06cc [?] on the other. J.A.S.B., 1862, p. 425.\n\nI have received from Mr. C.P. Brown the following note in reply to my queries as to the probable derivation of the word Chital:\n\n\"I have been considering the inquiry you make regarding chital \u062c\u06cc\u0644. You probably are aware that it is mentioned in the Ayin-i-Akbari, in the chapter on coins. There it evidently is an ideal money, like the farthing. You believe it may be connected with chhe tol \u062a\u0648\u0644, but I rather judge it to be merely the Sanskrit chitra \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930 meaning 'odd' as a species; or as an odd sum, a fraction; the smallest coins in copper, which in Marata and Dakhni are called khurd\u0903 \u0916\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0903 (see Wilson's Glossary, p. 288), and in America bits; or a fraction even of these, which in the bazar are often represented or paid in a few pinches of grain. As the Sanskrit month Chaitra is in Bengali Chait, and the Chitra-durgam, or 'odd coloured hill,' is in Dakhni called \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0932 \u0921\u0942\u0917 Chittle droog, I think this may be the true derivation. The cauri, kowry, is not mentioned in the Ayin-i-Akbari, and probably was not yet introduced into India. We still call the smallest fractions 'grains;' and that which is indefinite would be chitre, or, according to the Musulm\u00e2ni pronunciation, cheetul. There is also a form of it, chillera \u091a\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0930\u093e or chitra \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e used in the Madras countries. Wilson notices it in his Glossary, p. 112, but fails to perceive its origin. It is precisely the same in sense. In Sanskrit scientific treatises, after a general rule, chitram is given as being a species, or sub class: chillara may often be rendered miscellaneous; and this is the same in idea.\"\nIt remains to discover upon what principles the new silver coinage of Altamsh was based. That copper was the ruling standard by which the relative values of the more precious metals were determined, there can scarcely be a doubt. The estimate by Panas of the ancient Law-giver, the constant reckoning by Chitals of the early Muhammadan intruders, down to the revenue assessments of Akbar, all of which were calculated in copper coin, sufficiently establish the permanency of the local custom, and the intrinsic contents of Altamsh's Sikkah or \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0641\u0631\u0629 of 174 or 175 grains, must primarily have been regulated by the silver equivalent of a given number of Chitals. Had the old silver Puranas been still in vogue, the new coin might have been supposed to have been based upon their weights and values; three of which Puranas would have answered to an approximate total of 96 ratis; but although the weight of the old coin had been preserved in the more modern Dehli-walas, the metallic value of the current pieces had been so reduced, that from 16 to 24 would probably have been required to meet the exchange against the original silver Tankah; on the other hand, although the number of 96 ratis does not occur in the ancient tables, the combination of the inconvenient number of three Puranas into one piece, is by no means opposed to Vedic ideas; and there can be no question but that the traditional 96 ratis, of whatever origination, is constant in the modern tolah; but, as I have said before, the question whether the new coin was designed to constitute an even one hundred rati-piece, which, in process of time, by wear or intentional lowering of standard weights, came to settle down to the 96 rati tolah, remains to be proved by the determination of the decimals in troy-grains, which ought to be assigned to the normal rati.\n\nI now proceed to notice the historical bearings of the coins of the Bengal series.\n\nAny general revision of a special subject, coincident with the discovery of an unusually large amount of new illustrative materials, owes a first tribute to previous commentators\u2014whose range of identification may chance to have been circumscribed by more limited archaeological data, the application\nof which may equally have been narrowed by the inaccessibility of written history, heretofore confined, as in the present instance, to original Oriental MSS., or the partial transcripts and translations incidentally made known to the European world. At the head of the list of modern contributors must be placed, in point of time, M. Reinaud, who, so long ago as 1823, deciphered and described several types of the Bengal Mintages, commencing with those of Il\u00edas Sh\u00e1h (No. viii. of this series).\u00b9 Closely following appeared Marsden's elaborate work, which, among other novelties, displayed a well-sustained sequence of Bengal coins, with corresponding engravings still unequalled, though in point of antiquity, producing nothing earlier than the issues of the same Il\u00edas Sh\u00e1h, who had inaugurated the newly-asserted independence of the southern monarchy, with such a wealth of coinages.\u00b2 Next in order, must be cited a paper, in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, by Mr. Laidlay, which added materially to the numismatic records of the local sovereigns, though still remaining deficient in the development of memorials of the more purely introductory history of the kingdom.\u00b3 I myself, in the course of the publication of the Imperial Coins of the Path\u00e1n Sult\u00e1ns of Dchli,\u2074 had occasion to notice two pieces of Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, one of which proved of considerable interest, and likewise coins of both Shams-ud-d\u00edn F\u00edr\u00faz, and Mub\u00e1r\u00e1k Sh\u00e1h, whose defective marginal legends, however, defeated any conclusive assignment to their original producers.\n\nThe chronicles of a subordinate and, in those days, but little accessible country were too often neglected by the national historians at the Court of Dehli, even if their means of information as to the course of local events had not necessarily been more or less imperfect.

One of the most touching chapters of Indian history is contributed by the incidents of this monarch\u2019s meeting with his own arrogant son, Muiz-ud-din Kaikub\u00e1d, who had succeeded to the superior dignities abjured by the father. They then met as nominal Vassal and Suzerain, but little unequal in power, and each occupying independent and preparedly hostile camps, on the ordinary route between their respective capitals. Oriental etiquette, and more reasonable distrust, for a time, delayed the interview, in which, at last, nature was destined to re-assert its laws, and to reconcile even conflicting royal interests, by subduing, for the moment, the coarse vices of the son in the presence of the tempered virtues of the father.\n\nRepeated amicable conferences, however, merely resulted in each returning on his way, with but little change in the relative political position of either; and the comparatively obscure repose of N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn Mahm\u00fad remained undisturbed, while other successors filled his son\u2019s throne at Dehli. The more immediate question bearing upon the attribution of the earliest coins in the Kooch Bah\u00e1r treasure, is exactly how long did N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn continue to live and reign. Z\u00ed\u00e1-i-Barni, and those who follow his ill-digested history, affirm that he retained his provincial kingship till 699 A.H., when he divested himself of all symbols of royalty in the mere dread of the confessedly overwhelming power of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Muhammad Sh\u00e1h, to be, however, reinstated by that Sult\u00e1n; and, finally, it is asserted that N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn was still in existence, and once again reinvested with the full insignia of a king, by Tughlak Sh\u00e1h, in A.H. 724.\n\nZ\u00ed\u00e1-i-Barni, p. 142; Ibn Batutah, iii., p. 178; Lee\u2019s Translation, p. 117; and \u0642\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u062f\u064a\u0646 of Amir Khusr\u00fa, Dehlivi.\n\nPrinted edition, p. 451; Budauni MS.; Feriahtah (Briggs, i. p. 406).\nIbn Batutah, a higher authority in proximity of time, and obviously more intimate with the purely indigenous history, states that N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn, on his return from his interview with his son, reigned some years (\u0633\u0646\u064a\u0646), an expression which is scarcely compatible with the idea of a nearly continuous rule of \"forty-three solar years,\" and a decease in A.H. 725, as adopted by Stewart: a prolongation of administrative functions indeed altogether inconsistent with the direct evidence of the dates on the money of Kai K\u00e1\u00fas, or the parallel proof of Shams-ud-d\u00edn's exercise of the functions of sovereignty in 702 A.H., associated as they are with the uncontested historical and numismatic demonstration of the succession of one grandson, Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn, whose ejection from his inherited section of the kingdom by his more powerful brother, Bah\u00e1dur, formed so prominent a ground for imperial interference in the affairs of Bengal, are each and all too well ascertained to leave any doubt that the authors who make N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn's reign extend to 725 must be in error; the source of the mistake seems as simple as it is obvious, the mere omission of the son's name as preceding that of the father, in Persian MS. writing, or simple ignorance of the order of local successions, would account for the whole difficulty. And, as is obvious, Ibn Batutah's own personal knowledge, and possibly correct autograph version, reproduced independently in other lands, have not saved later transcripts of his work from analogous imperfections.\n\nBut there are other and more direct internal evidences in the texts of the Indian authors, of confusion and imperfect knowledge in the relation of the incidents attendant upon the re-settlement of Bengal by Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn in A.H. 699, where it is stated that \"a chief, named Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n,\" was at this time appointed to \"the eastern districts of Bengal,\" with the object of dividing the province, and thus rendering its rulers\n\n1 French edition, iii., p. 179, and xiii. Dr. Lee's \u0646\u0633\u0631\u064a\u0646 \"two years,\" p. 118, is an error.\n2 Ex.gr., Bah\u00e1dur is made the son of N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn, at p. 179, vol. iii., instead of the grandson, which the text at p. 210, vol. iii., and p. 213, vol. iv., affirms him to have been. Lee's MS. authorities again, in omitting the intermediate name of N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn, skip a generation, and ante-date Shams-ud-d\u00edn (Fird\u00fas) in constituting him a son of Gh\u00edf\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Balban (p. 128).\n3 Ferishtah, Briggs, i., p. 406; Stewart, p. 79.\n\"more subservient to the Court of Dehli.\" It is highly improbable, had N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn been living at the epoch in question, that a grandson of his should have been selected for such a charge to the supercession of his own father, Shams-ud-d\u00edn, or in priority to the son of that father, Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn, who was the elder or perhaps better-born brother of Bah\u00e1dur, each of whom, Ibn Batutah certifies, in turn succeeded to royal honours in the old capital of Bengal.\n\nHaving completed this simple outline of the historical data, I now proceed to describe the coins in their due order; first on the list in priority of time is a piece which I can only doubtfully assign to Bengal, and whose individual appropriation, moreover, must remain to a certain extent inconclusive. The coin itself will be seen to bear the hereditary name of the first Moslem Conqueror of India, Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed, and the oft-revived title of the founder of the dynasty, N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn Subuktag\u00edn, a conjunction of royal designations already seen to have been applied to a succession of Path\u00e1n princes, whose intitulation followed antecedent conventionalisms.\n\nN\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn.

The second Mahm\u00fad, must, under these conditions, have been but of tender years, and though, at this conjuncture, promoted to the titular honours of an elder brother, not in any position to exercise authority in his own person, and less likely to have had medallic tribute paid to him by his father, should such have been the origin of the exceptional specimen under review. To the first-born N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn Mahm\u00fad, no such objections apply; he was very early invested by his sire, with the administration of the important government of H\u00e1nsi, and in 623 A.H., advanced to the higher charge of the dependencies of Oudh, from which quasi frontier, he was called upon to proceed against His\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn Avaz, (No. 4 in the list of Governors, supra), who had already achieved a very complete independence in the province of Bengal. Here, his arms were fortuitously, but not the less effectually, successful, so that he had honours thrust upon him even to the Red Umbrella, and its attendant dignities,\u00b3 what-\n\n\u00b9 Tabak\u00e1t N\u00e1siri, p. 181; p. 201.\n\u00b2 Path\u00e1n Sult\u00e1ns of Dehli, coin No. 33, p. 22.\n\u00b3 His title is usually limited by Minh\u00e1j-ul-Sir\u00e1f to pp. 177, 181, 201;\never the exact measure of these may have been. Under such triumphant coincidences, it is possible that the universal favourite, the still loyal heir-apparent, may have placed his own name on the coinage, without designed offence, especially as at this time Moslem Mints were only beginning to adapt themselves to their early naturalization on Indian soil, and when the conqueror's camps carried with them the simple machinery, and equally ready adepts, for converting bullion plunder on the instant into the official money of a general, or his liege sovereign. Altamsh's own circulating media were only in process of crude development at this period, and had scarcely risen superior to the purely Hindu currencies it had served the purpose of his predecessors to leave virtually intact: his own strange Turki name,\u00b9 and that of many of his successors, continued to figure in the Nagari letters of the subject races on the surfaces of the mixed silver and copper coins of indigenous origin, at times commemorative of imperfectly achieved conquests, and the limited ascendancy implied in the retention of the joint names of the conqueror and the momentarily subject monarch;\u00b2 while the Sult\u00e1n's own trial-\n\nbut on one occasion \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 crops out incidentally in the Court list where, in his place among the sons of the Emperor Altamsh, he is so designated, p. 178.\n\n\u00b9 This name I have, as a general rule, retained in the form accepted as the conventional English orthography\u2014Altamsh. The correct rendering of the original is still an open question, but the more trustworthy authors reproduce the designation as \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a\u0645\u0634, a transcription supported in a measure by the repetition of the third letter in the Kufic dies, and made authoritative, in as far as local pronunciation is concerned, by the Hindi correlative version of \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a\u0645\u0634 (Path\u00e1n Sult\u00e1ns, Coin No. 14). The inscription on the Kutb Min\u00e1r, at Dehli, has \u0627\u06cc\u0644\u062a\u0645\u0634, which accords with the Arabic numismatic rendering on the reverses of the Hindi Coins now cited.\n\nSee also T\u00e1j-ul-Ma\u00e1sir, Alitimish: Was\u00e1f, Alitimish, and at times \u0622\u0644\u062a\u06cc\u0645\u06cc\u0634 Badauni, Ailitimish.\n\nElliot's Historians of India, p. 111.\n\n\u00b2 See coins of Chahir deva.\n\nObverse.

But the obverse inscription in the present instance differs from the later Dehli nomenclature in the addition of the word Sh\u00e1h after the name of Mahm\u00fad,\u00b9 and contrasts as singularly in the forms of the letters, and the insertion of the short vowels with the more deferred issues, as it, on the other hand, closely identifies itself in these marked peculiarities with the initial dies of Altamsh and the closely sequent coinages of Riz\u00edah, two of which latter are now known to be the produce of the Lakhnauti Mint.\n\nRIZ\u00cdAH.\n\nThe earliest coins that can be definitely attributed to a Bengal mint, are those of the celebrated Queen Regnant of Muhammadan India\u2014Riz\u00edah, the daughter of Altamsh. The ministers at her father's court were scandalized at the preference it was proposed to extend to a daughter, in supercession of the claims of adult male heirs to the throne; but the Sult\u00e1n justified his selection, alike on account of the demerits of his sons, and the gifts and acquirements of his daughter, who had been brought up under the unusual advantages of freedom from the seclusion enjoined for females by the more severe custom of ordinary Moslem households, aided by the advantages incident to the exalted position occupied by her mother as the leading and independently-domiciled wife. After the brief reign of Rukn-ud-d\u00edn Fir\u00faz, extending over\n\n\u00b9 So, in written history, N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn Mahm\u00fad, the Emperor, is called by his own special biographer, \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0638\u0645 \u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 (pp. 9, 177, 178, 201, etc.) which is in contrast to the nominal adjunct so constant with his predecessors, Fir\u00faz Shah, Bahr\u00e1m Shah, Mas\u00e1ud Shah. On one occasion only does the additional Shah appear in a substituted list of Altamsh's Court (p. 178), where the text gives\u20141. Sult\u00e1n N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn \u2022 \u2022 2.

Riz\u00edah's early inauguration was attended with no inconsiderable danger and difficulty, arising from the organised military resources of the various governors of provinces, who hesitated in conceding their allegiance. Eventually, however, to use the expression of Minh\u00e1j-ul-Sir\u00e1j, quiet was established throughout the empire, and Riz\u00edah's sway was acknowledged from \"Daibal to Lakhnauti.\" In A.H. 737, the Empress proceeded in person to quell an outbreak on the part of Ikht\u00ed\u00e1r-ud-d\u00edn Alt\u00fan\u00edah, Governor of Tiberhind; but was taken captive in the engagement that ensued, and, possibly with scant ceremony, introduced into the harem of the conqueror, who shortly afterwards advanced upon Dehli in the hope of recovering the sovereignty, to which he had thus acquired an adventitious claim; but his army was in turn defeated, and himself and Riz\u00edah met their deaths near Kaithal in the month of Rabi-al-Awal, A.H. 738.\n\nThe contemporary biographer in his official lists styles this queen \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646\u0629 \u0631\u0636\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646, a title which she affects on the ordinary copper coins, but on the silver money she adopts the designation of \u062c\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646.\n\nJal\u00e1l\u00e1t-ud-d\u00edn.

Rajendra l\u00e1l Mitra has suggested a notion that N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn Mahm\u00fad, the son of Balban, so often mentioned in this article, sought, as local ruler of Bengal, \u201cto continue his allegiance to his grandson Kaimurs [momentarily king of Dehli], even after his deposition, and possibly after his death,\u201d by retaining his name on the public money. I should be disposed to seek a less complicated explanation of the numismatic evidences. Kai Ka\u00fas\u2019 date, tested by the examples of his mintages in the Kooch Bah\u00e1r hoard, is limited, in range of time, to five years (691\u2013695 A.H.); a latitude might be taken beyond the ascertained units, which are somewhat indeterminate in their tracings, and have equally suffered from abrasion, on the exposed margins of the coins, but the ninety and the six hundred can scarcely be contested. If we examine the political state of India at this period, we find that Hindust\u00e1n was abnormally quiet under the feeble rule of Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn F\u00edr\u00faz (687\u2013695 A.H.): Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn\u2019s conquests in the Dakhin could have but little affected Bengal, so that any changes that may have taken place in the latter kingdom were probably due to successional or revolutionary causes arising within its own limits. We can scarcely build up a theory of an access of vigour and assumption of independence by N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn himself; nor is it probable that, in such a case, he would have changed both his title and his name. Besides, the array of titles on the coins in the triple succession of Sult\u00e1ns is altogether inconsistent with his actual origin. Though he was the son of one emperor of Dehli, and the father of another, he could scarcely ignore the rise of the former from a state of slavery, or conceal the fact that Balban himself never pretended to have been the offspring of a king. The two alternatives remain of either supposing\n\n1 Jour. As. Soc. Beng., 1864, p. 508.\n2 Rajendra l\u00e1l says, \u201cthe units one and three are perfectly clear.\u201d Col. Guthrie\u2019s three coins are imperfect in the word for the unit. I observe traces of a four on two specimens; and I read, with some certainty, 696 on another.\nthat N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn died before 691 A.H., a question discussed elsewhere, or to conclude that his son Rukn-ud-d\u00edn Kai K\u00e1\u00fas temporarily assumed kingship during the lifetime of his father,\u00b9 and that his limited reign and local obscurity saved his memory from the comments of history. I fully endorse Rajendra l\u00e1l\u2019s suggestion that Kai K\u00e1\u00fas would have been likely to be selected as a name for one of a family who took so many of their designations from Persian heroic ages, and the elaborate intitulation adopted by that prince, on his coins, of the \u201cSon and grandson of a Sult\u00e1n,\u201d favours such an identification.\u00b2 It will be seen that although the opening terms of his obverse legends follow the conventional and unvarying mint phraseology in the use of \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064e\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646, the (reigning) Sult\u00e1n, yet after his own proper name he styles himself merely \u0633\u064e\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646, and seemingly desired to strengthen his position by the insertion of the regal titles of his father and grandfather, though there is so far room for questioning this supposition in the fact that the father had fallen short of supreme power, and was only doubtfully authorized to call himself Sult\u00e1n, while in strictness the Imperial Balban should have been designated the Sultan (past regnant); but, on the other\n\n\u00b9 The following is the genealogical tree, according to Ibn Batutah. See vol. iii., pp. 174-5, 179, 210, 462; vol. iv., p. 212.\n\n\u00b2 The name of the son of Kai Kob\u00e1d, who was elevated to the throne of Dehli on the death of his father, is variously given by Oriental writers as Shams-ud-d\u00edn \u0643\u064a\u06a9\u0627\u0648\u0648\u0633 and \u0643\u064a\u06a9\u0627\u0648\u0648\u0633. Bud\u00e1uni and the Mir\u00e1t-ul-Alam (MS.) give Kai K\u00e1\u00fas, but the majority of authors prefer the Kaiomurs. Z\u00ed\u00e1-i-Barni does not state the name of the boy, but mentions a son of Altamah, in the previous generation, as having been called Kaiomurs (printed ed. p. 126).\nhand, N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn had been so long virtually a king in the south, that the complimentary use of the term was quite within heraldic licence; and it is to be remarked, that a similar omission of the supreme prefix occurs in N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h's coin (No. 1), which, if correctly attributed, would prove the legitimacy\\(^1\\) of the optional use of one or the other form.\n\nThese are avowedly mere speculations; but when it is considered how much attention was paid in India, in those days, to every varying shade and degree of honorary rank, how much importance was attached to even the colours of official umbrellas,\\(^2\\) and other, to us, minor observances, it cannot but be felt that these subordinate indications may chance to prove of material aid in illustrating doubtful interpretations.\n\nKai K\u00e1\u00fas.\n\nNo. 3.\n\nLakhnaut\u00ed, A.H. \"691, 693,\"\\(^3\\) and 694-695.\n\nSilver.

I mention this fact as I am at present unable\nrefer to the coin itself.\n\nVOL. II.\u2014[NEW SERIES].\nThe singularly limited number of the coins of this prince, confined\u2014if Calcutta selections be not at fault\u2014to three examples amid the 13,500 accumulated specimens of the currencies of other kings of the land over which he temporarily held sway, sufficiently mark his status in the general list of the potentates of the century in which he lived. No date or place of mintage is preserved on his extant money, and the single additional item supplied by their aid is his personal or proper name, which appears on their surfaces as \u0628\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0646, a crude outline which might suggest a doubt as to the conclusiveness of the transcription of \u0628\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0646, now confidently adopted as expressing an optional rendering of the grandfather's title of \u0628\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0646, a name which was even further distorted from the T\u00fcrki original by the conversion of the medial \\( r \\) into the vernacular cerebral \\( q \\) or \\( d \\). For the rest, the pieces themselves, under the mechanical test, in their make, the forms of their letters, and the tenor of their legends, evidently follow closely upon Shams-ud-din's mintages, and as clearly precede the money of the same locality, issued by Gh\u00edas-ud-din Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, who in 724 A.D. drove this, his own brother, Shah\u00e1b-ud-din to take refuge with Gh\u00edas-ud-din Tughlak Sh\u00e1h. Bah\u00e1dur's career has yet to be told in connexion with his own coins; but to dispose of Shah\u00e1b-ud-din,\n\n---\n\n1 The name of this king does not appear in any of Rajendra Lal's lists.\n\n2 The ancient name of \u0628\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0646 of Bokhara notoriety in 350 A.H. (Fr\u00f6hn Recensio Numorum Muhammadanorum, pp. 139, 593, 678), was subjected to strange mutations on Indian soil. My authority for the substitution of the final \\( j \\) in place of the vowel \\( i \\) is derived from Ibn Batutah, who uniformly writes the word with an \\( j \\) (iii. 231, 5, 293). Ferishtah (text, p. 131) has \u0628\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0646, whence Stewart's Bagora (p. 74). Dow gave the name as Kera, and Briggs as Kurra (i. pp. 265, 270, etc.).\n\n3 Those who delight in interesting coincidences might see, in this name of Shah\u00e1b-ud-din, a most tempting opportunity for associating him with a really important record by the Indig\u00e8nes themselves, inscribed on a stone slab in the fort of Chun\u00e1r, setting forth their victory over a \"Malik\" Shah\u00e1b-ud-din, quoted as acting under Muhammad bin Tughlak, in Samvat 1390 (A.H. 734); but I confess I do not myself encourage the identification. Chun\u00e1r is certainly not out of the range of access from Bengal; but other men of mark may have filled this command, and the name of the fortress itself is never heard of in reference to the affairs of the kingdom of Lakhnauti, in those early days, though the main road of communication between the two capitals of the north and the south took its course through Bud\u00e1un or Kanauj and Jaunpore. The inscription\nas far as the exercise of his Mint prerogatives are concerned, he seems to have been lost to fame, from the date when he was absorbed with an associate fugitive brother (N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn) under the \u00e6gis of the Emperor of Dehli.\n\nis otherwise well worthy of further examination, in as far as it concerns the history of imperial influence upon proximate localities; and as such I transcribe both the text and Dr. Mills' translation of the brief passages which may chance to illustrate the general subject.\n\nVerse 6:\n\n\u0936\u0939\u093e\u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0926\u0940\u0928\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0915\u0941\u091f\u093e\u092c\u0926\u092f\u0935\u0932\u0947\u0916\u092e\u0938\u0939\u092e\u0926\u093e\u0964\n\u0935\u0948\u0930\u093e\u091c\u094b \u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f\u0924\u094b\u0932\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0915\u094b \u0935\u0948\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e\u092a\u093f \u0915\u0941\u092a\u093e\u0928\u093f\u0927\u093f\u0964\n\n\"By Mu\u1e25ammad, lord of the hostile Yavanas Shah\u0101b-ud-d\u012bn and the rest, though an enemy, was Sair\u0101ja, the treasure of benignity, employed as prime minister.\"\n\nVerse 11:\n\n\u0938\u0902\u0935\u0924\u094d \u0967\u0969\u096d\u0966 \u092d\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0930\u092a\u0926\u093f \u096b \u0917\u0941\u0930\u0940 \u0935\u0948\u0930\u093e\u091c\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0928\u0917\u0930\n\u092c\u093e\u0917\u092e\u0924\u092e\u093f\u0915\u0938\u0939\u093e\u092c\u0926\u0940\u0928\u0930\u091a\u093f\u0924\u0902\u0964\n\n\"Samvat 1370, in the month of Bhadra, fifth day of the waning moon, on Thursday, was the kingdom set free from Malik Shah\u0101b-ud-d\u012bn, acting under the protecting favour of Sair\u0101ja Deva aforesaid.\"\n\n\u2014(See Journal As.

I am aware that this is treacherous ground to venture upon; but such a supposition is not without other incidental support, especially in Ibn Batutah's passage (original, iii. 214, quoted at p. 192), where Kadr Kh\u0101n is spoken of as if he had been in effect the last scion of the family of N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u012bn Mahm\u016bd Bughrah.\n\nThe original passages in Ferishtah are as follows (i. p. 237):\n\n\u0648 \u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0628\u064a\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u062e\u0644\u062c\u064a \u0631\u0627 \u062a\u062f\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u062e\u0637\u0627\u0628 \u0643\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u062c\u0648\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0646\u0627\u0645\u0631\n\u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0641\u0648\u062a \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0642\u0637\u0639 \u0644\u06a9\u0647\u0646\u0648\u062a\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u0648 \u062f\u0627\u062f (i. p. 244). \u062f\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0642\u062a\n\u06cc\u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0646\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u062f\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u0627 \u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0641\u062e\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u06a9\u0641\u062a\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0632\n\u0641\u0648\u062a \u0628\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645 \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0628\u06a9\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u063a\u064a \u0648\u0631\u0632\u06cc\u062f \u0648 \u062a\u062f\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0627 \u06a9\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u062e\u0632\u0627\u0646\u06cc\n\u0644\u06a9\u0647\u0646\u0648\u062a\u06cc \u0645\u062a\u0635\u0631\u0641 \u0634\u062f\n\nSee also Briggs' Translation, i. pp. 412, 423.\n\nThe T\u0101r\u012bkh Mub\u0101rak Sh\u0101hi has the name in manifest mistranscription as Band\u0101r.\n\n\u0648 \u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0628\u064a\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u062e\u0644\u062c\u064a \u062a\u062f\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u062f \u0648 \u0627\u0642\u0637\u0639 \u0644\u06a9\u0647\u0646\u0648\u062a\u06cc \u06cc\u0627\u0641\u062a\n\nA difficulty necessarily suggests itself in regard to the tribe of Khilji, but the use of the name in its non-ethnic sense might readily be explained by the old subordination of the Bengal family to the Khilji dynasty of Fird\u016bz, or the specially Khilji serial succession of the earlier governors of Bengal.\nShah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn.

Ibn Batutah records with sufficient distinctness, that he conquered and set aside his regnant brother Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn, sometime prior to Gh\u00ed\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn Tughlak's reassertion of the ancient suzerainty of Dehli over the lightly-held allegiance of Bengal, and his eventual carrying away captive the offending Bah\u00e1dur, who was, however, soon to be released, and restored with added honours, by Muhammad bin Tughlak, almost immediately on his own accession. Indian home-authors, who so rarely refer to the affairs of the Gangetic delta, give vague intimations of the first appointment of Bah\u00e1dur to Eastern Bengal by 'Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Muhammad in A.H. 799, assigning to him an inconceivable interval of\n\n1 \u062c\u0648\u0646 \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0631\u06a9\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0645\u0644\u06a9 \u0627\u0648\u062f\u0647 \u0631\u062e\u0635\u062a \u06a9\u0631\u062f \u0627\u0646\u062c\u0647 \u0632\u0631\n2 \u0646\u0642\u062f \u062f\u0631 \u062e\u0632\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0628\u06cc\u06a9\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0646\u0639\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0648\u062f\u0627\u062f.\nTabak\u00e1t-i-Akbari.\n\nSee also Z\u00ed\u00e1-i-Barni, printed edit. p. 461.\n\n* Stewart, p. 76.

I might have some doubt as to the conclusiveness of the reading of the date 710 on his money in the Kooch Bah\u00e1r trouvaille, but I have none as to the clear expression of A.H. 711 and 712, though the singular break occurring between 712 (or 714) and 720 suggests a suspicion of an originally imperfect die-rendering of the \u0639\u0634 = 10 for \u0639\u0634\u064a\u0646 = 20;\u00b9 which would bring the corrected range of Bah\u00e1dur's dates to 720\u2013724; but even these figures leave something to be reconciled in reference to their associate place of mintage, for in 720\u2013722, his father, Shams-ud-d\u00edn Fir\u00faz, was clearly in possession of the already commemorated \"Lakhnauti;\" but such an anomaly might be explained by the supposition that Bah\u00e1dur, in the earlier days, used the name of Lakhnauti as a geographical expression for a portion of the dominions ordinarily administered from that capital. Undoubtedly the first appearance of the contrasted designation of the Eastern capital \"Son\u00e1rgaon,\" occurs on a coin of his father; but even this sign of discrimination of Urban issues would not be altogether opposed to a continuance by Bah\u00e1dur of the loose usage of Camp Mints, of naming the metropolis as the general term for the division at large, or inconsistent with the subsidiary legitimate employment of the designation of the province on a coinage effected anywhere within its own boundaries,\u2014either of which simple causes may have prevailed, and been utilized with a new motive, if any covert ulterior meaning might be designed, as implying that Bah\u00e1dur himself had special successional or other claims to the metropolitan districts.\n\n\u00b9 Among more critical Arabic scholars than the Bengal Mint Masters ever affected to be, this point would have been easily determined by the insertion or omission of the conjunction \u0648, which, as a rule, is required to couple the \u0639\u0634 and the twenties, but is not used with the \u0639\u0634 and tens.\nTughlak Sh\u00e1h's intervention in the affairs of Bengal seems to have originated in an appeal on the part of the ejected Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn against the usurpation of his brother Bah\u00e1dur. The result of the Imperial expedition to the South was the defeat, capture, and transport to Dehli of Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h; but among the first acts of the new Sult\u00e1n, Muhammad bin Tughlak, was the release and re-installation of the offender, showing clearly that he was something more than an ordinary local governor, transferable at will, and that possibly the interests of the father and son, in their newly-established dynastic rank, and the confessed insubordination of the latter, were independently advocated by the opposing members of the royal line of Bengal, whose family tree could show so much more ancient a series of regal successions than their parvenu Suzerains, whose elevation dated scarce five years back. One of the most interesting illustrations of the present series is contributed by coin No. 9, in the legends of which Bah\u00e1dur acknowledges the supremacy of Muhammad bin Tughlak over Eastern Bengal during A.H. 628.\u00b9 The subjection seems, however, to have been of brief duration, as sometime in or after the year A.H. 730 Bah\u00e1dur appears to have reverted to an independent coinage, in a new capital called after his own title Ghi\u00e1sp\u00far (coin No. 8), and in A.H. 733 Muhammad bin Tughlak is found issuing his own coin in Bengal, and Bah\u00e1dur, defeated and put to death, contributed an example to insurgent governors in his own skin, which was stuffed and paraded through the provinces of the empire.\n\n\u00b9 Ibn Batutah gives the following additional particulars of Bah\u00e1dur's reinstallation:\u2014\"Il [Muhammad bin Tughlak] lui fit de nombreux cadeaux en argent, chevaux, \u00e9l\u00e9phants, et le renvoya dans son royaume. Il exp\u00e9dia avec lui le fils de son fr\u00e8re, Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Kh\u00e1n; il convint avec Beh\u00e1dur B\u00f3urah qu'ils poss\u00e9deraient ledit royaume par \u00e9gales moiti\u00e9s; que leurs noms figurerait ensemble sur les monnaies; que la pri\u00e8re serait faite en leur nom commun, et que Ghiy\u00e2th edd\u00edn enverrait son fils Mohammed dit Berbath (\u0628\u0631\u0628\u0627\u062b), comme \u00e9tage pr\u00e8s du souverain de l'Inde. Ghiy\u00e2th edd\u00edn partit, et observa toutes les promesses qu'il avait faites; seulement, il n'envoya pas son fils, comme il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9. Il pr\u00e9tendit que ce dernier s'y \u00e9tait refus\u00e9, et, dans son discours, il blessa les convenances. Le souverain de l'Inde fit marcher au secours du fils de son fr\u00e8re, Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Kh\u00e1n, des troupes dont le commandant \u00e9tait Doldji altatiry (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u062c\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u06cc). Elles combattirent Ghiy\u00e2th edd\u00edn et le tu\u00e8rent; elles le d\u00e9pouill\u00e8rent de sa peau, qu'on rembourra de paille, et qu'on promena ensuite dans les provinces.\"\u2014Vol. iii. p. 316.\nTHE INITIAL COINAGE OF BENGAL\n\nIV.

GH\u00c1ZI SH\u00c1H.\n\nAt the period of this king's accession to the sovereignty of Son\u00e1rgaon in A.H. 750 or 751, we lose the aid of our most trustworthy recorder of the annals of Bengal during his own time. The conclusion of Ibn Batutah's narrative leaves Fakhr-ud-d\u00edn Mub\u00e1rak still in power, while the native authorities are clearly at fault in their arrangement of dates and events, and altogether silent as to any change in the succession in Eastern Bengal except in their allusions to the more than problematical capture of Fakhr-ud-d\u00edn and his execution by 'Al\u00ed Mub\u00e1rak in 743 A.H., with the final accession of Il\u00ed\u00e1s \"one year and five months afterwards.\"\u00b9\n\nThe numismatic testimony would seem to show that Mub\u00e1rak was succeeded by his own son, as the Ul Sult\u00e1n bin Ul Sult\u00e1n may be taken to imply. The immediately consecutive dates, and the absolute identity of the fabric of the coins, as well as the retention of the style of Right-hand of the Khalifat on the reverse, alike connect the two princes; while the cessation of the issues of Gh\u00e1zi Sh\u00e1h simultaneously with the acquisition of Son\u00e1rgaon by Il\u00ed\u00e1s, in A.H. 753, would seem to point to the gradual spread of the power of the latter, which is stated to have been at its zenith just before Fir\u00faz III. assailed him in his newly consolidated monarchy in 754.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Stewart, p. 83.\n\u00b2 Shams-i-Sir\u00e1f, speaking on hearsay, affirms that Shams-ud-d\u00edn Il\u00ed\u00e1s captured and slew Fakhr-ud-d\u00edn after Fir\u00faz III.'s first expedition into Bengal; and that the main object of the latter's second invasion of that province was for the purpose of reasserting the rights of Zafar Kh\u00e1n, the son-in-law of Fakhr-ud-d\u00edn (who had fled for protection to Dehl\u00ed), to the kingdom of Eastern Bengal. It is asserted that although Fir\u00faz succeeded in obtaining this concession from Sikandar, who, in the interval, had succeeded to his father's throne, Zafar Kh\u00e1n himself was wise enough to decline the dangerous proximity to so powerful a rival monarch, and to return in the suite of the Sult\u00e1n. The Beng\u00e1li troops, under Zafar Kh\u00e1n, subsequently distinguished themselves in an opposite quarter of India, near Tattah, and their commander was eventually left in charge of Guzr\u00e1t.\u2014Shams-i-Sir\u00e1f, book ii. cap. 9, etc.\u2014See also Journal Archaeological Society of Dehli (Major Lewis' abstract translation), 1849, p. 16.\n\nThe T\u00e1rikh-i-Mub\u00e1rak Shahi (dedicated to Mub\u00e1rak II.), the concluding date of which is 838 A.H., also declares that H\u00e1ji Il\u00ed\u00e1s killed Fakhr-ud-d\u00edn in 741 A.H.

IL\u00cd\u00c1S SH\u00c1H.\n\nThe modern application of old coins divides itself into two branches\u2014the suggestive development of obscure tradition and the enlargement and critical revision of accepted history. The transition point between these arch\u00e6ological functions, in the present series, declares itself in the accession of Il\u00ed\u00e1s Sh\u00e1h, the first recognised and effectively independent Moslem Sult\u00e1n of Bengal, the annals of whose reign have been so often imperfectly reproduced in prefatory introduction to the relation of the magnificent future his successors were destined to achieve as holders of the interests and the commercial prosperity of the Delta of the Ganges, to whose heritage, indeed, England owes its effective ownership of the continent of India at the present day.\n\nThe compiler of the English version of the early history of Bengal adopts the conclusion that H\u00e1j\u00ed Il\u00ed\u00e1s first obtained power on the assassination of \u201c\u2019Ali Mub\u00e1arak\u201d in 745-6, but the previous rectification of the independent personality and status of the two individuals thus singularly absorbed into one, will prepare the reader for the corrections involved, though not,\n\n1 Stewart, p. 83.\nperhaps, for the apparent anomalies the coins disclose. Medallio testimony would seem to indicate a long waging of hostile interests between the real 'Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h and H\u00e1j\u00ed Il\u00ed\u00e1s, before the latter attained his final local triumph; for although Il\u00ed\u00e1s is seen to have coined money in Fir\u00faz\u00e1b\u00e1d in 740 A.H., the chance seems to have been denied him in 741; and in 742 his adversary, 'Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h, is found in full possession of the mint in question. The Kooch Bah\u00e1r hoard reveals no coin of either party dated 743, but in 744 the two again compete for ownership, which 'Al\u00ed Sh\u00e1h for the time being continues through 745 into 746, when the annual series is taken up and carried on successively for an uninterrupted twelve years by his more favoured opponent. It is needless to speculate on the varying course of these individual triumphs; suffice it to say, that the increasing power of the ruler of Pandua, in 754, excited the Emperor Fir\u00faz III. to proceed against him in all the pomp and following of an Oriental suzerain\u2014resulting only in the confession of weakness, conveniently attributed to the periodical flooding of the country\u2014which effectively laid\n\n1 Stewart felt a difficulty about the right position of Akddalah, the real point of attack, and a place of considerable importance in the local history of Bengal. The following is Z\u00ed\u00e1-i-Barn\u00ed's description of the place, taken from the concluding chapters of his history on the occasion of Fir\u00faz Sh\u00e1h's (III.) invasion of Bengal in 754 A.H.:\n\nP. 688, printed edit.\n\nRennell gives another Akdallah north of Dacca. \"Map of Hindoostan.\"\n\nIn the following passage Shams-i-Siraj desires to make it appear that Fir\u00faz III. gave his own name to the city of Pandua; but, as we have seen that the designation was applied to the new capital either in 740 or 742\u2014that is, long before Fir\u00faz became king of Delhi, it will be preferable to conclude that the name was originally bestowed in honour of the Shams-ud-d\u00edn Fir\u00faz of Bengal, of the present series.

To numismatists the enhanced proportion will\nbe more significantly shown by a reference to the additional number of Mint-cities, the singular variety of new types produced, and above all, by the sustained series and corroborating repetitions of annual dates. It is under the latter aspect alone that I have now to comment on the history of a reign already sufficiently told in other pages. Sikandar Sh\u00e1h' placidly succeeded his father towards the end of 759 A.H., and the coins of the period sufficiently support the date of such a transfer of power, in the final 758 recorded on the issues of the father, though proof of the accession of the son is less marked, as the seeming anomaly obtained\u2014under the conjoint efforts of father and son to achieve release from thraldom to a distant suzerain\u2014of a concession to the son of much independent power, and, coincidently, the right to coin money in his own name, whether in his own camps or in his father's royal cities. Though some of the earlier designed coins give evidence of due humility in titular phraseology, the same simplicity is adhered to, in continuous mintages, long after the removal of any possible impediments or restrictions to the adoption of comparatively exalted titles; though in the more independent governmental mintages of 758 A.H. (No. 21) the \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0638\u0641\u0631 is affected even during the life-time of the father, and, after his own accession, higher assumptions, and a more definite approach towards personal hierarchical honors, are discovered in the metropolitan issues of 766-780 (No. 22), while special service against the infidels seems to be implied in the novel intitulation of \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u062f\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, \"The conqueror of the enemies of God,\" on the Fir\u00faz\u00e1b\u00e1d money of 769 A.H. (No. 23).\n\nBut the most interesting details furnished by Sikandar's coins are those which illustrate the geographical distribution of the chief seats of government. Unlike the Northern Moslems, who, in the difficulty of moving the Eastern hosts\u2014conventionally deemed essential to an Imperial progress\u2014over the imperfect highways of Hindust\u00e1n, confined themselves ordinarily to one fixed metropolis, the kings of Bengal enjoyed facilities of river communication almost un-\nprecedented: their various capitals, situated within easy distance of one another, were at all times accessible by water,\u2014a differently constructed State barge secured at any season free approach to the seaboard cities of the Great Ganges or the towns on the narrow channels of the western streams. These frequent regal visitations are incidentally recorded on the coinage of the day, by the insertion of the prefix of \u062d\u0636\u0631\u062a to the name of the selected residence, which term colloquially marked the presence of royalty within the limits of the favoured fiscal division.\n\nSikandar's mint cities were five in number\u2014No. 2, Firuzabad; 3, Satgaon; and 4, Shahr Nau, in Western Bengal; with 5, Sonargaon; and 6, Muizzamabad, in the Eastern division of the province.\n\n2. The first-named mint, in addition to the preferential Hazrat, is styled variously Baldat and \u0628\u0644\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0647\u0631\u0629 \"fortified city,\" a specification which probably refers to the separate though closely proximate citadel of Akdalah, so celebrated in the military annals of the time (coin No. 26).\n\n3. Satgaon is distinguished by the prefix of \u0639\u0631\u0635\u0629 (Atrium) a term which, in India, came to be conventionally used for a tract or geographical division of country, a sense which would well accord with its application to Satgaon, as the third circle of government of Bengal proper. In the subsequent reign of Aazam the mint specification is more directly brought into\n\n1 \"Presentia, Majestas; urbe, in qua est regis sedes.\"\n\n2 \u0639\u0631\u0635\u0629 \u0632\u0645\u06cc\u0646 in Persian, means \"surface of the earth.\" Sir Henry Elliot remarks, \"The words used before Akbar's time to represent tracts of country larger than a Pargannah were \u0648\u0644\u064a\u062a, \u062f\u064a\u0627\u0631, \u0639\u0631\u0635\u0629, \u062e\u0637\u0629, \u0633\u062a, and \u0623\u0642\u0637\u0639\u2014Glossary of Indian Terms, sub voce, \"Circar.\"\n\n3 Zia-i-Barni, in introducing his narrative of Tughlak Shah's expedition to Bengal (A.H. 724), speaks of that province as consisting of the three divisions of Lakhnauti, Sonargaon, and Satgaon\" (p. 450, printed edit.).\n\nThe Ayin-i-Akbari, in the xvi. cent. A.D., thus refers to Satgaon, \"There are two emporiums a mile distant from each other; one called Satgaon, and the other Hoogly with its dependencies; both of which are in the possession of the Europeans.\"\u2014Gladwin, ii. p. 15.

Shahr Nau, I suppose to have been the intitulation of the new city founded near the site of the old Lakhnauti; it is variously denominated as the simple 'Arsat or \u0639\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0636\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064f\u062c\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0629\u0650 (populous, richly cultivated). This progressively less appropriate name may be supposed to have merged into the official Jannat\u00e1b\u00e1d, which follows in Mint sequence.\n\n4. Son\u00e1rgaon, as a rule, retains its ancient discriminative designation of \u062d\u064e\u0636\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064f \u062c\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064d, a title which it eventually had to cede to its rival Mu\u00e1zaam\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\n6. Mu\u00e1zaam\u00e1b\u00e1d. There is no definite authority for the determination of the site of this city, which, however, seems to have been founded by Sikandar about 758-759 A.H.,\n\n1 From \u0635\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064c \"amputavit:\" hence \u0635\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064c \"oppidum, vel potior, praecipua pars oppidorum.\"\n\n2 The decipherment of the name of this mint (as Col. Yule reminds me) determines for medieval geography the contested site of Nicol\u00f2 Conti's Cernove. The Venetian traveller in the East in the early part of the fifteenth century is recorded to have said that \"he entered the mouth of the river Ganges, and, sailing up it, at the end of fifteen days he came to a large and wealthy city called Cernove... On both banks of the stream there are most charming villas and plantations and gardens. Having departed hence he sailed up the river Ganges for the space of three months, leaving behind him four very famous cities, and landed at an extremely powerful city called Maaraizia... having spent thirteen days on an expedition to some mountains to the eastward, in search of carbuncles\"... he returned to the city of Cernove, and thence proceeded to Bactetania.\"\u2014The travels of Nicol\u00f2 Conti, Hakluyt Society, London, pp. 10, 11.\n\nSee also Purchas, vol. v. p. 508; and Murray's Travels in Asia, ii. 11.\n\nThere are also many interesting details regarding the geography of Bengal, and a very full and lucid summary of the history of the period, to be found in \"Da Asia de Jo\u00e3o de Barros\" (Lisboa, 1777, vol. iv. [viii.], p. 465 et seq.). At the period of the treaty of Alfonso de Mello with \"El Rey Mamud de Bengala\" (the king whom Shir Shah eventually overcame) the name of Shahr Nau had merged into the old provincial designation of Gaur, which is described as \"a principal Cidade deste Reino he chamado Gouro, situada nas correntes do Gange, e dizem ter de comprido tres leguas das nossas, e duzentos mil vizinhos\" (p. 458).\n\nSatigam makes a prominent figure on the map, and Sornagam is located on a large island within the Delta, the main stream dividing it from Daca, which is placed on the opposite or left bank of the estuary.\n\nMore modern accounts of the old city may be found in Purchas, i. 579; Churchill, viii. 54; also Rennell, Memoir of a Map of Hindoostan, London, 1788, p. 55; Stewart, p. 44, and in a special work entitled \"The Ruins of Gour,\" illustrated with maps, plans, and engravings of the numerous Muhammadan edifices extant in 1817, by H. Creighton, 4to., London, Black, Parbury and Allen. See also Elliot's Glossary of Indian Terms, sub voce, Gour Brahmin.\n\n3 The adjective (derived from \u0635\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064c, Coluit) will admit of other meanings, and, if understood as applying to a town, might signify \"well-built,\" locally Pakk\u00e1.\nwhen his own coins record that he himself assumed the title of \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0638\u0627\u0644\u0645, without trenching upon the superlative usually reserved for the reigning monarch. I conclude that there was a gradual migration from the ancient Sonargaon to the new city, which grew in importance from the governmental centre implied in the \u0627\u0642\u0644\u064a\u0645 \u0645\u0639\u0638\u0645 \u0627\u0628\u0627\u062f (No. 19) of 760 A.H., to the \u0628\u0644\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0638\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0645\u0639\u0638\u0645 \u0627\u0628\u0627\u062f, \u201cthe great city of Mu'azamabad\u201d (No. 28) of about 780 A.H., till, on the disappearance of the name of Sonargaon from the marginal records of the general currency, the new metropolis appropriates to itself the immemorial \u062d\u0636\u0631\u0647 \u062c\u0644\u0627\u0644 of Eastern Bengal (No. 32 A.)\n\nWith a view to keep these brief geographical notices under one heading, I advert for the moment to No. 7, Ghidaspur, of which locality I have been able to discover no trace; and likewise anticipate the due order of the examination of A'azam Shah's mint cities in referring to the sole remaining name of Jannatabad, an epithet which is erroneously stated to have been given by Humayun to the re-edified Lakhnauti, but which is here seen to have been in use a century and a half before the Moghuls made their way into Bengal.\n\nThe single item remaining to be mentioned in regard to A'azam's mints is the substitution of the word \u062a\u0633\u0645\u064a\u0629 in lieu of \u0628\u0644\u062f\u0629 as the prefix to Firuzabad (No. 35), in parallel progress towards centralization with the Mint phraseology adopted in the case of Satgaon.\n\nSikandar Shah bin Ildas Shah.\n\nNo. 17.\n\nFiruzabad, A.H. 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 758, 759, 760.\n\nType No. 1.

Sec.\n\nThe following paper is a Specimen of what pretends to be no more than a Skeleton Dictionary of the Assyrian Language, which the few who know anything of the matter will assuredly expect to find incomplete, and often erroneous. The compiler, though well aware that such expectation will not be disappointed, believes that no apology is required; for many years must necessarily elapse before an approach can be made to completeness in such a work, and the best Assyrian decipherers are the most assured of the vague character of their interpretations, whenever the subject goes much beyond plain narration, or whenever words of infrequent occurrence are made use of. He ought rather, with Semitic knowledge limited to a superficial acquaintance with Hebrew, and with but little leisure, to apologize for venturing at all upon such an attempt; but having got together a very large number of words while assisting Sir Henry Rawlinson in the preparation of inscriptions for publication, and being, moreover, of opinion that a work like the present, which requires little more than persevering industry, will never be compiled by men of greater powers who are better employed, he was unwilling that his labour should be thrown away, and hopeful that it might be of some use. He believes that his compilation may serve as a repository in which Assyrian students may jot down their difficulties, and where they may occasionally look for help, by collating passages containing the words they are\ninvestigating. He only asks credit, in the words of an early critic lately reprinted, for \"his diligence in breaking the yce, and givinge lighte to others, who may moore easely perfecte then begyne.\"\n\nIf the Specimen given should be thought satisfactory, the compiler would propose to commence at once the printing of the whole Dictionary; and he hopes that our Rawlinsons and Hinckses will gradually fill up deficiencies, and correct the errors which they will certainly find in most pages; he scarcely ever looks over the sheets himself without making additions, and, he trusts, improvements.\n\nHe has to acknowledge, with thanks, much valuable help from Dr. Hincks in a considerable part of this Specimen, and he feels bound to declare that he is indebted for almost everything he knows of Assyrian to the direct communications or to the writings of Sir Henry Rawlinson.\n\n* Francis Thynne's Animadversions, &c., page 9; reprinted in 1865.\n\nThe arrangement of words written with a syllabary must always be more difficult than with an alphabet; but with the Assyrian syllabary, encumbered as it is by monograms, determinatives, polyphones, unpronounceable proto-Babylonian symbols, and varying orthography, the difficulty is greatly increased. We must work by compromise, and sometimes elude a difficulty we cannot conquer. After trying and giving up several schemes, the compiler has adopted the following:\n\nWords are arranged according to the order of the Hebrew alphabet, and no notice is taken of inherent unwritten vowels, or of the complementary vowels following them, which serve at most only to lengthen the syllable. Thus, [bu ur] is\nentered as BR, [e mu uk] as EMK, [as ti] as ST, or [a ga, a ga a] as AG,\n[su a tu] as SAT. is entered as H.\n\nwhich appears to be etymologically equivalent to \\( \\upsilon \\), is often used as a complementary vowel to a syllable with inherent i, and is transliterated as e.* As Assyrian writing made no distinction between the hard and soft sounds [surds and sonants] of final consonants, using only one form for ab and ap, one for ug, uk, and uq, &c., such consonants are always arranged as soft [sonants], mainly because b, g, d, come before p, k, t, in the alphabet. Polyphones will also be entered under their earliest initial; for example, which may be read dan, kal, or lib, will come under D. This rule, limiting each character to one place, is in accordance with our own usage: we place Caius and Cicero under C, although the initial sound of one is k, of the other s; and the words physic, psalm, ptisan, and paper, appear in our dictionaries under P, although pronounced with initial f, s, t, and p. An exception to the rule of taking the earliest letter of the alphabet is made when the polyphone is a character of the ordinary syllabary, and likewise when the polyphone has usually one sound only, any other being rarely found.\n\nIn this way the student will generally know where to look for any given word; the few which remain doubtful will be placed, if the initial be known, at the end of the class of words having that initial; other doubtful words will be put at the end of the Dictionary.\n\nIn all this the notation for purposes of arrangement must be distinguished from the transliteration, which will be mentioned presently.\n\n* It is curious that when the Jews write German in Hebrew letters, they have for centuries represented the vowel e by \\( \\upsilon \\), making der Mensch \\( \\text{\u05d3\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05e0\u05b0\u05e1\u05b6\u05da} \\), &c.\nIn the body of the work the compiler, of course, begins each paragraph with the word to be explained\u2014he will give it first in the cuneiform character, in all the forms he has noted, and then in Roman letters; the English equivalent will follow, and any cognate word known to him in another Semitic language. He will quote one or more phrases containing the word in question, with a literal translation, word for word; when he is unable to read or translate a passage, he must leave it for more advanced students. The cuneiform character may be occasionally omitted in these phrases, to save room and avoid repetition, when the original is published in some work easily procurable. He apprehends that this plan will exhibit pretty clearly the limits of his knowledge, but he disclaims any pretence of knowing all, or even a very large proportion of all that is known; he has not read carefully, with the idea of preparing a dictionary, even all that is in print, and not a twentieth part of what remains on the clay slabs, which may be fairly termed \"in manuscript.\"\n\nThe verbs will follow separately, with classified examples of all the forms which the compiler has recorded, together with any obvious nominal derivatives, which may be referred to the earlier part of the Dictionary.\n\nHe has included in his plan the names of persons and places, which may be useful historically and geographically; also extracts from syllabaries and bilingual lists, sometimes fragmentary, mostly without any attempt at explanation. Some groups of characters may also be found which are no words at all, but only parts of one or more words from sentences of which he could make nothing.\n\nThe transliteration will be, so far as practicable, the most usual representation of the Hebrew letters, with the phonology\nof which language that of the Assyrian appears to have a greater analogy than with that of any other Semitic idiom. The \u1e63, \u1e2b, \u1e2b, and \u1e63, will be distinguished from \u1e63, \u1e63, \u1e2b, and \u1e63, by a dot below\u2014\u1e25, \u1e6d, \u1e63, and \u1e63; the ambiguous characters representing both m and v will be made m or v, as accordant with etymology; in doubtful cases m will be preferred. What is called mimmaton will be made by a line over the vowel so affected, e.g., will be made t\u0101, li, &c.\n\nAccad or proto-Babylonian words will be generally rendered as if they were Assyrian, and left to take their chance in that form; with the exception of a few of frequent occurrence, whose Assyrian equivalents are well known from vocabularies and variant readings, and which could not be conveniently transliterated, such as nahr (river), same (heaven), yom (day), eni (eyes), uzni (ears), kappi (hands), naru (tablet), huraz (gold), kaspu (silver), and perhaps a few more. No positive rule can be laid down, but in any uncertainty both forms will be given; there is no doubt whatever, strange as it may appear, that the Assyrians in such cases wrote a word in one language and pronounced it in another.* Determinatives before\n\n* This we ourselves do when we write \"viz.\" and pronounce it \"namely.\" It appears from the following French translation of a passage in the \"Fihrist\" by Mons. de Quatrem\u00e8re, that this was also done by another eastern nation, many centuries ago:\u2014\"Les Perses ont aussi un alphabet appel\u00e9 zowarah, dont les lettres sont tant\u00f4t li\u00e9es, tant\u00f4t isol\u00e9es. Le vocabulaire se compose d'environ mille mots, et ils s'en servent pour distinguer les expressions qui ont une forme semblable. Par exemple, quiconque veut \u00e9crire le mot gouecht, qui, en arabe, signifie lahm (chair), \u00e9crit bieria, qu'il prononce gouecht; si l'on veut \u00e9crire nan qui signifie pain, on trace le mot lahm, que l'on prononce nan. Il en est ainsi des autres mots, \u00e0 l'exception de ceux qui n'ont point besoin d'\u00eatre d\u00e9guis\u00e9s, et que l'on \u00e9crit comme ils se prononcent.\"\u2014Journ. Asiat. Paris, March, 1835. p. 256. This refers, of course, to the so-called Pahlavi language.\nproper names will be generally omitted in transliteration, and the name printed with a capital letter. Throughout the work a normal character will be used, as near to the older Assyrian forms as the disposable typographical arrangements will admit; consequently all the hieratic and the more recent Babylonian and Persian words will be written in the same ancient alphabet.\n\nList of Abbreviations used in Referring to Inscriptions.\n\nBeh. . . .

VIII.\u2014On the Relations of the Priests to the other Classes of Indian Society in the Vedic Age.\u00b9 By J. Muir, Esq.\n\nIn a former paper on \"Manu, the progenitor of the Aryan Indians,\" published in the Society's Journal,\u00b2 I have attempted to shew that in general the authors of the hymns of the Rig-veda regarded the whole of the Aryan people, embracing not only the priests and the chiefs, but the middle classes also of the population, as descended from one common father, or ancestor, whom they designate by the name of Manu. This reference to a common progenitor excludes, of course, the supposition that the writers by whom it is made could have had any belief in the myth which became afterwards current among their countrymen, that their nation consisted of four castes, differing naturally in dignity, and separately created by Brahm\u0101.\n\nThat essay, however, leaves out of consideration any notices which the Rig-veda may contain regarding the different classes of which the society contemporary with its composition was made up. As this great collection of hymns embodies numerous references, both to the authors themselves and to the other agents in the celebration of divine worship, it may be expected to supply, incidentally or indirectly, at least, some\n\n\u00b9 This subject has been already treated in Professor Roth's book, Zur Litt. u. Geschichte des Weda; in his essay \"Brahma und die Brahanen,\" in the 1st vol. of the Journal of the Germ. Or. Society; in Dr. Haug's Tract on \"the Origin of Brahmanism,\" and in the 1st vol. of my \"Sanskrit Texts.\"\n\n\u00b2 Vol. xx. p. 406 ff.\ninformation respecting the opinion which these ministers of religion entertained of themselves, and of the relation in which they stood to the other sections of the community. I shall now endeavour to shew how far this expectation is justified by an examination of the Rig-veda.\n\nI have elsewhere\\(^1\\) enquired into the views which the authors of the hymns appear to have held on the subject of their own authorship. The conclusion I arrived at was, that they did not in general look upon their compositions as divinely inspired, since they frequently speak of them as the productions of their own minds (ibid. pp. 128\u2013140). But though this is most commonly the case (and especially, as we may conjecture, in regard to the older hymns), there is no doubt that they also attached a high value to these productions, which they describe as being acceptable to the gods (R.V. v. 45, 4; v. 85, 1; vii. 26, 1, 2; x. 23, 6; x. 54, 6; x. 105, 8), whose activity they stimulated (iii. 34, 1; vii. 19, 11), and whose blessing they drew down. In some of the hymns a supernatural character or insight is claimed for the Rishis (i. 179, 2; vii. 76, 4; iii. 53, 9; vii. 33, 11 ff.; vii. 87, 4; vii. 88, 3 ff.; x. 14, 15; x. 62, 4, 5), and a mysterious efficacy is ascribed to their compositions (Sanskrit Texts, vol. iii. pp. 173 f.) The Rishis called their hymns by various names, as arka, uktha, rch, gir, dhi, nitha, nivid, mantra, mati, stikta, stoma, vach, vachas, etc. etc.; and they also frequently applied to them the appellation of brahma, as, for instance, in the whole, or most, of the following passages:\u2014i. 31, 18; i. 37, 4; i. 61, 16; i. 62, 13; i. 80, 16; i. 117, 25; i. 152, 5, 7; i. 165, 14; ii. 18, 7; ii. 23, 1, 2; ii. 34, 6; ii. 39, 8; iii. 18, 3; iii. 29, 15; iii. 51, 6; iii. 53, 12; iv. 6, 11; iv. 16, 20, 21; iv. 22, 1; iv. 36, 7; v. 29, 15; v. 40, 6; v. 73, 10; v. 85, 1; vi. 17, 13; vi. 23, 1, 5; vi. 38, 3, 4; vi. 47, 14; vi. 50, 6; vi. 52, 2, 3; vi. 69, 4, 7; vi. 75, 19; vii. 22, 3, 9; vii. 28, 1, 2, 5; vii. 31, 11; vii. 33, 3, 4; vii. 35, 7, 14; vii. 37, 4; vii. 61, 2, 6; vii. 70, 6; vii. 72, 3, 4; vii. 83, 4; vii. 97, 3, 9; vii. 103, 8; viii. 4, 2; viii. 32, 27; viii. 51, 4; viii. 52, 2; viii. 55, 11; viii. 78, 3; viii. 87, 8; x. 13, 1; x. 54, 6;\n\n\\(^1\\) Sanskrit Texts, vol. iii. pp. 116\u2014164.\nx. 61, 1, 7; x. 80, 7; x. 89, 3; x. 114, 8. That in these passages brahma has generally the sense of hymn or prayer is clear from the context of some of them (as in i. 37, 4; viii. 32, 27, where brahma is joined with the verb g\u0101yata \"sing,\" and in vi. 69, 7, where the gods are supplicated to hear it), as well as from the fact that the poets are said (in i. 62, 13; v. 73, 10; vii. 22, 9; vii. 31, 11; x. 80, 7) to have fashioned or generated it, in the same way as they are said to have fashioned or generated hymns in other texts (as i. 109, 1; v. 2, 11; vii. 15, 4; viii. 77, 4; x. 23, 6; x. 39, 14), where the sense is indisputable; while in other places (iv. 16, 21; v. 29, 15; vi. 17, 13; vi. 50, 6; vii. 61, 6; x. 89, 3) new productions of the poets are spoken of under the appellation of brahma.\n\nThat brahma has the sense of hymn or prayer is also shown by the two following passages. In vii. 26, 1, it is said: \"Soma not poured out does not exhilarate Indra; nor do libations without hymns (abrahm\u0101nah = stotra-hin\u0101h, S\u0101yana). I generate for him a hymn (uktha) which he will love, so that like a man he may hear our new (production). 2. At each hymn (uktha) the soma exhilarates Indra, at each psalm (nitha) the libations (exhilarate) Maghavat, when the worshippers united, with one effort invoke him for help, as sons do a father.\"\u00b9\n\nAgain in x. 105, 8: \"Drive away our calamities. With a hymn (rcha) may we slay the men who are hymnless (anrcha\u1e25). A sacrifice without prayer (abrahma) does not please thee well.\"\n\nI have said that great virtue is occasionally attributed by the poets to their hymns and prayers; and this is true of those sacred texts when called by the name of brahma, as well as when they receive other appellations, such as mantra.\n\n\u00b9 It is clear from the context of this passage that abrahm\u0101nah means \"unattended by hymns,\" and not \"without a priest.\" After saying that soma-libations without hymns are unacceptable to Indra, the poet does not add that he is himself a priest, or that he is attended by one, but that he generates a hymn; and the same sense is required by what follows in the second verse. Accordingly we find that S\u0101yana explains abrahm\u0101nah by stotra-hin\u0101h, \"destitute of hymns.\" The same sense is equally appropriate in the next passage cited, x. 105, 8. On iv. 16, 9, where abraham is an epithet of dasyu, \"demon,\" S\u0101yana understands it to mean \"without a priest,\" but it may mean equally well or better, \"without devotion.\"\nThus it is said, iii. 53, 12, \"This prayer (brahma) of Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra protects the tribe of Bharata;\" v. 40, 6, \"Atri with the fourth prayer (brahman\u0101) discovered the sun concealed by unholy darkness;\" vi. 75, 19, \"Prayer (brahma) is my protecting armour;\" vii. 33, 3, \"Indra preserved Sud\u0101s in the battle of the ten kings through your prayer, o Vasishthas.\" In ii. 23, 1, Brahmanaspati is said to be the \"great king of prayers,\" and in v. 2 to be the \"generator of prayers\" (janit\u0101 brahman\u0101m); whilst in x. 61, 7, prayer is declared to have been generated by the gods.\n\nBr\u0101hm\u0101n in the masculine is no doubt derived from the same root as br\u0101hm\u0101n neuter, and though differing from it in accent as well as gender, must be presumed to be closely connected with it in signification, just as the English \"prayer\" in the sense of a petition would be with \"prayer,\" a petitioner, if the word were used in the latter sense. As, then, br\u0101hm\u0101n neuter means a hymn or prayer, brahman in the masculine must naturally be taken to denote the person who composes or repeats a hymn or prayer. We do not, however, find that the composers of the hymns are in general designated by the word brahman, the name most commonly applied to them being \u1e5bshi, though they are also called vipra, vedhas, kavi, etc. (see \"Sanskrit Texts,\" vol. iii. pp. 116 ff.). There are, however, a few texts, such as i. 80, 1; i. 164, 35; ii. 12, 6; ii. 39, 1; v. 31, 4; v. 40, 8; ix. 113, 6, etc., in which the priest (brahm\u0101) may perhaps be understood as referred to in the capacity of author of the hymn he utters. So, too, in ii. 20, 4 and vi. 21, 8, a new composer (or, perhaps, merely a new reciter) of hymns is spoken of under the appellation of nutnasya brahmanyakata\u1e25; in ii. 19, 8, the Grtsamadas are spoken of both as the fabricators of a new hymn (manma naviyah) and as (brahmanyakata\u1e25) performing devotion; while in another place (x. 96, 5) Indra is said to have been lauded by former worshippers, p\u016brvebhir yajvabhi\u1e25, a term usually confined (as br\u0101hm\u0101n was frequently applied) in after times to the offerers of sacrifice. In three passages, vii. 28, 2; vii. 70, 5; and x. 89, 16, the brahma and brahm\u0101ni \"prayer\" and \"prayers\" of the \u1e5bshis are spoken of; and in vii. 22, 9,\nrshis are said to have generated prayers (brahm\u0101ni). In i. 177, 5, we find brahm\u0101ni k\u0101roh, \u201cthe prayers of the poet.\u201d The fact that in various hymns the authors speak of themselves as having received valuable gifts from the princes their patrons, and that they do not speak of any class of officiating priests as separate from themselves, would also seem to indicate an identity of the poet and priest at that early period. The term brahman must therefore, as we may conclude, have been originally applied (1) to the same persons who are spoken of elsewhere in the hymns as rshi, kavi, etc., and have denoted devout worshippers and contemplative ages who composed prayers and hymns which they themselves recited in praise of the gods. Afterwards, when the ceremonial gradually became more complicated, and division of sacred functions took place, the word was more ordinarily employed (2) for a minister of public worship, and at length came to signify (3) one particular kind of priest with special duties. I subjoin a translation of the different passages in which the word occurs in the Rig-veda; and I have attempted to classify them according as it seems to bear, in each case, the first, second, or third of the senses just indicated. This, however, is not always an easy task, as in many of these texts there is nothing to fix the meaning of the term with precision, and one signification easily runs into another, as the same person may be at once the author and the reciter of the hymn.\n\nI.

In the following verse (v. 54, 7) a rishi and a prince are distinguished much in the same way as a priest and king are in i. 108, 7: \"That man, whether rishi or prince, whom ye, O Maruts, support, is neither conquered nor killed, he neither decays nor is distressed, nor is injured; his riches do not decline, nor his support.\" Compare v. 14, where it is said, \"Ye, O Maruts, give riches with desirable men, ye protect a rishi who is skilled in hymns (\u00e9dma-vipra); ye give a horse and food to Bharata, ye make a king prosperous.\" In iii. 43, 6, reference is found to Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra, or the author, being made by Indra both a prince and a rishi.\niv. 50, 7 ff. \"That king overcomes all hostile powers in force and valour who maintains Brihaspati in abundance, who praises and magnifies him as (a deity) enjoying the first distinction. 8.

In the following passages the word brahman appears to designate the special class of priest so called, in contradiction to hotri, udg\u00e2tri, and adhvaryu.\n\nii. 1, 2 (= x. 91, 10). \u201cThine, Agni, is the office of hotri, thine the regulated office of potri, thine the office of neshtri, though art the agnidh of the pious man, thine is the office of pras\u00e2stri, thou actest as adhvaryu, thou art the brahman, and the lord of the house in our abode. 2. Thou, Agni, art Indra, the chief of the virtuous, thou art Vishnu, the wide-stepping, the adorable, thou, o Brahmanaspati, art the priest (brahm\u00e2), the possessor of wealth, thou, o sustainer, art associated with the ceremonial.\u201d\n\n1 This verse also distinctly proves that the priesthood already formed a profession. Verse 3 of the same hymn is as follows: \u201cI am a poet, my father a physician, my mother a grinder of corn.\u201d Unfortunately there is nothing further said which could throw light on the relations in which the different professions and classes of society stood to each other.\niv. 9, 3. \"He (Agni) is led round the house, a joyous hotri at the ceremonies, and sits a potri. 4. And Agni is a wife (i.e. a mistress of the house) at the sacrifice, and a master of the house in our abode, and he sits a br\u0101hm\u0101n.\"\n\nx. 52, 2. \"I have sat down an adorable hotri; all the gods, the Maruts, stimulate me. Day by day, ye A\u015bvins, I have acted as your adhvaryu; the brahman is he who kindles the fire: this is your invocation.\"\n\nI shall now bring forward the whole of the texts in which the word Br\u0101hm\u0101\u1e47a, meaning a son, or descendant, of a br\u0101hm\u0101n, occurs in the Rig-veda. They are the following:\n\ni. 164, 45. \"Speech consists of four defined grades. These are known by those Br\u0101hmans who are wise. They do not reveal the three which are esoteric. Men speak the fourth grade of speech.\"\n\nThis text is quoted and commented upon in Nirukta xiii. 9.\n\nvi. 75, 10. \"May the Br\u0101hma\u1e47 fathers, drinkers of soma, may the auspicious, the sinless, heaven and earth, may P\u016bshan preserve us,\" etc. etc.\n\nvii. 103, 1 (= Nirukta 9, 6). \"After lying quiet for a year, those rite-fulfilling Br\u0101hmans\u00b2 the frogs have (now) uttered their voice, which has been inspired by Parjanya...7. Like Br\u0101hmans at the Atir\u0101tra soma rite, like (those Br\u0101hmans) speaking round about the full pond (or soma-bowl\u00b3),\n\n\u00b9 There are two more texts in which the word br\u0101hm\u0101na is found, viz., i. 15, 5, and ii. 36, 5, on which see the following note. The word brahmoputra, son of a brahman, is found in ii. 43, 2: \"Thou, O bird, singest a s\u0101ma verse, like an udg\u0101tri; thou singest praises like the son of a brahman at the libations.\"\n\n\u00b2 In the Nighantus, iii. 13, these words br\u0101hm\u0101\u1e47a vrata-ch\u0101rin\u0101\u1e25 are referred to as conveying the sense of a simile, though they are unaccompanied by a particle of similitude. In his Illustrations of the Nirukta, p. 126, Roth thus remarks on this passage: \"This is the only place in the first nine mandalas of the R.V. in which the word Br\u0101hm\u0101\u1e47a is found with its later sense, whilst the tenth mandala offers a number of instances. This is one of the proofs that many of the hymns in this book were composed considerably later (than the rest of the R.V.). The word br\u0101hm\u0101na has another signification in i. 15, 5; ii. 36, 6; and vi. 75, 10. (In the first of these texts, Roth assigns to the word the sense of the Br\u0101hmans' soma-vessel. See his Lexicon, s.v. It does not appear what meaning he would give to the word in vi. 75, 10. He has in this passage overlooked R.V. i. 164, 45, which, however, is duly adduced in his Lexicon.) See Wilson's translation of the hymn; as also M\u00fcller's, in his Anc. Sansk. Lit. p. 494 f.\n\n\u00b3 Saras. See R.V. viii. 66, 4, quoted in Nirukta v. 11, where Y\u0101ska says, \"The ritualists inform us that at the mid-day oblation there are thirty ukiha platters destined for one deity, which are then drunk at one draught. These are here called saras.\" (Compare Roth's Illustrations on the passage.) See also R.V. vi. 17, 11, and viii. 7, 10, with S\u0101yana's explanations of all three passages).\nyou frogs surround (the pond) on this day of the year, which is that of the autumnal rains. 8. These soma-offering Br\u0101hmans (the frogs) have uttered their voice, performing their annual devotion (brahma); these adhvaryu priests sweating with their boiled oblations (or in the hot season) come forth from their retreats like persons who have been concealed.\"\n\nx. 16, 6. \"Whatever part of thee any black bird, or ant, or serpent, or wild beast has mutilated, may Agni cure thee of all that, and Soma who has entered into the Br\u0101hmans.\"\u00b9\n\nx. 71, 1.\u00b2 \"When, o Brhaspati, men first sent forth the earliest utterance of speech, giving a name (to things), then all that was treasured within them, most excellent and pure, was disclosed through love.\n\n2.

Verses 4 and 5 are explained in S\u0101yana's Introduction to the Rig-veda, pp. 30 f., of M\u00fcller's edition.\n\u00b3 I quote here as somewhat akin to this hymn another from the A.V. vi. 108, being a prayer for wisdom or intelligence. 1. \"Come to us, wisdom, the first, with cows and horses; (come) thou with the rays of the sun; thou art to us an object of worship. 2. To (obtain) the succour of the gods, I invoke wisdom the first, full of prayer, inspired by prayer, praised by rishis, imbibed by Brahma-ch\u0101rins. 3.

(= Nir. xiii. 13.) \"When Br\u0101hmans who are friends strive (?) together in efforts of the mind produced by the heart, they leave one man behind through their acquirements, whilst others walk about boasting to be priests.\" (This is the sense Prof. Aufrecht suggests for the word ohabr\u0101h-m\u0101nah. Prof. Roth s.v. thinks it may mean \"real priests.\" The author of Nirukta xiii. .13, explains it as meaning \"reasoning priests,\" or \"those of whom reasoning is the sacred science.\")\n\n9. \"The men who range neither near nor far, who are neither (reflecting) Br\u0101hmans nor yet pious worshippers at libations,\u2014these, having acquired speech, weave their web imperfectly, (like) a female weaver, being destitute of skill.\"\n\n10. \"All friends rejoice at the arrival of a renowned friend who rules the assembly; for such a one, repelling evil, and bestowing nourishment upon them, is thoroughly prepared for the conflict (of discussion).\"\n\n11.

In i. 126, 3, and vi. 27, 8, also, the word vadh\u016bmantah is used as here, and is probably to be taken in the first of these passages of mares, and in the latter of cows, vinsatim g\u0101 vadh\u016bmanto, being \"twenty bulls with their cows.\" The same sense of cows or mares is probably to be understood in viii. 19, 36.

From the etymology (apparently sm\u0101t for sumat, \"good\" or \"well,\" and dish\u1e6di, \"pleasure\" or \"good luck,\") one would suppose it ought to mean \"blessed\" or \"fortunate,\" a sense which might also suit the context of iii. 45, 5.\n\n3 Tok\u0101\u1e41 tok\u0101ya.

Br. xiii. 5, 4, 14: \"Neither former nor later men of the five races have reached this great work of Bharata (performed) to-day, as no mortal has reached the sky with his arms.\"\nother passages which I shall cite below, of indifference to the gods and to their ministers manifested by the other sections of the community, we may think it necessary to make some deduction from the impression which we had at first received of the estimation in which the priestly order was held at the time when the hymns of the Rigveda were composed. But after every such allowance has been made, it will remain certain that the brahman, whether we look upon him as a sage and poet, or as an officiating priest, or in both capacities, was regarded with respect and reverence, and even that his presence was considered an important condition of the efficacy of the ceremonial. Thus, in i. 164, 35, the priest is described as \"the highest heaven of speech;\" in x. 107, 6, a liberal patron is called a rishi and a priest, as epithets expressive of the greatest eulogy; in x. 125, 5, the goddess V\u00e2ch is said to make the man who is the object of her special affection a priest and a rishi; in vi. 45, 7; vii. 7, 5; viii. 16, 7; and ix. 96, 6, the term \"priest\" is applied honorifically to the gods Indra, Agni, and Soma; in iv. 50, 8, 9, great prosperity is declared to attend the prince by whom a priest is employed, honoured, and succoured; and in iii. 53, 9, 12; v. 2, 6; vii. 33, 2, 3, 5; and vii. 83, 4, the highest efficacy is ascribed to the intervention and intercession of priests.\n\nAgain, although the commendations which are passed in the hymns on liberality to priests have been composed by interested parties, and though the value of the presents bestowed has no doubt been enormously exaggerated, there is no reason to doubt that the ministers of public worship, who possessed the gift of expression and of poetry, who were the depositaries of all sacred science, and who were regarded as the channels of access to the gods, would be largely rewarded and honoured.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 It is to be observed that, in these eulogies of liberality, mention is nowhere made of Br\u00e2hmans as the recipients of the gifts. In two places, viii. 4, 20, and x. 33, 4, a rishi is mentioned as the receiver. In later works, such as the \u015a\u0101\u1e45khya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, on the contrary, the presents are distinctly connected with Br\u00e2hmans. Thus it is said in that work, ii. 2, 2, 6: \"Two kinds of gods are gods, viz., the gods (proper), whilst those Br\u00e2hmans who have the Vedic tradition, and are learned, are the human gods. The worship (yajna) of these is divided into two kinds. Oblations constitute the worship offered to the gods, and presents\nIt is further clear, from some of the texts quoted above (ii. 1, 2; iv. 9, 3; x. 52, 2), as well as i. 162, 5, and from the contents of hymns ii. 36; ii. 37; ii. 43; and x. 124, 1, that in the later part of the Vedic era, to which these productions are probably to be assigned, the ceremonial of worship had become highly developed and complicated, and that different classes of priests were required for its proper celebration. It is manifest that considerable skill must have been required for the due performance of these several functions; and as such skill could only be acquired by early instruction and by practice, there can be little doubt that the priesthood must at that period have become a regular profession.\n\nThe distinction of king or noble and priest appears to be recognized in i. 108, 7, as well as in iv. 50, 8, 9; whilst in v. 47, 7, 14, a similar distinction is made between king and rishi; and it is noticeable that the verse, in other respects nearly identical, with which the 36th and 37th hymns of the eighth mandala respectively conclude, ends in the one hymn with the words, \"Thou alone, Indra, didst deliver Trasadasyu in the conflict of men, magnifying prayers\" (brahm\u00e1ni vardhayan); whilst in the other the last words are, \"magnifying (royal) powers\" (kshattr\u00e1ni vardhayan), as if the former contained a reference to the functions of the priest, and the latter to those of the prince.\n\nWhile, however, there thus appears to be every reason for supposing that towards the close of the Vedic period the priesthood had become a profession, the texts which have been quoted, with the exception of one (x. 90, 12) which will\n\n(dakshin\u00e1) that offered to the human gods, the Br\u00e1hmans, who possess the Vedic tradition, and are learned. It is with oblations that a man gratifies the gods, and with presents that he gratifies the human gods, the Br\u00e1hmans, who possess the Vedic tradition, and are learned. Both these two kinds of gods, when gratified, place him in a state of happiness\" (mudh\u00e1y\u00e1m); (or \"convey him to the heavenly world,\" as the expression is varied in the parallel passage of the same work, iv. 3, 4, 4.)\n\n1 See also i. 94, 6, where it is said: \"Thou (Agni) art an adharyya, and the earliest hotri, a prap\u00e1ttri, a potri, and by nature a guruhita. Knowing all the priestly functions (\u00e1rtvij\u00e1) wise, thou nourishest us,\" etc.\n\n2 See Prof. M\u00fcller's remarks on this subject, Anc. Sansk.

Lit., pp. 485 ff.\nbe further adverted to below, do not contain anything which necessarily implies that the priests formed an exclusive caste, or, at least, a caste separated from all other by insurmountable barriers, as in later times.\\(^1\\) There is a wide difference between a profession, or even a hereditary order, and a caste in the fully developed Brahmanical sense. Even in countries where the dignity and exclusive prerogatives of the priesthood are most fully recognized (as in Roman Catholic Europe), the clergy form only a profession, and their ranks may be recruited from all sections of the community. So, too, is it in most countries, even with a hereditary nobility. Plebeians may be ennobled at the will of the sovereign. There is, therefore, no difficulty in supposing that in the Vedic era the Indian priesthood\u2014even if we suppose its members to have been for the most part sprung from priestly families\u2014may have often admitted aspirants to the sacerdotal character from other classes of their countrymen. Even the employment of the words *br\u0101hma\u1e47a* and *r\u0101janya* in the Rig-veda does not disprove this. The former word, derived from *brahman*, \"priest,\" signifies, as already intimated, nothing further than the son or descendant of a priest (the word *brahmaputra*, \"son of a priest,\" is, as we have seen, actually used in one text),\u2014just as the latter (*r\u0101janya*) means nothing more than the descendant of a king or chief (*r\u0101jan*).\n\nThe paucity of the texts (and those, too, probably of a date comparatively recent) in which the word *br\u0101hma\u1e47a*\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Dr. Haug, in his tract on the \"Origin of Brahmanism,\" p. 5, thus states his views on this question: \"It has been of late asserted that the original parts of the Vedas do not know the system of caste. But this conclusion was prematurely arrived at without sufficiently weighing the evidence. It is true the caste system is not to be found in such a developed state, the duties enjoined to the several castes are not so clearly defined as in the Law Books and Pur\u0101\u1e47as. But nevertheless the system is already known in the earlier parts of the Vedas, or rather presupposed. The barriers only were not quite so insurmountable as in later times.\"\\(^2\\) This view he supports by a reference to the Zend Avesta, from which he deduces the conclusion that the people had been divided into three classes even before the separation of the Indian from the Iranian Aryans, and adds: \"From all we know, the real origin of caste appears to go back to a time anterior to the composition of the Vedic hymns, though its development into a regular system with insurmountable barriers can be referred only to the latest period of the Vedic times.\"\\(^3\\) As thus stated, the difference between Dr. Haug and other European scholars is one of degree and age, not of principle, for none of them assert any distinction of race, or congenital difference, between the castes or classes.\n\n---\n\n\\(^2\\) Dr. Haug, in his tract on the \"Origin of Brahmanism,\" p. 5, thus states his views on this question: \"It has been of late asserted that the original parts of the Vedas do not know the system of caste.

In some of these passages (as in vii. 103, 1, 7, 8; x. 88, 19) the Br\u0101hman is merely alluded to as a priest, and in vii. 103, the comparison of frogs to Br\u0101hmans may seem even to imply a want of respect for the latter and their office. In other places (i. 164, 45, and x. 71, 8, 9) a distinction appears to be drawn between intelligent and unintelligent Br\u0101hmans, between such as were thoughtful and others who were mere mechanical instruments in carrying on the ceremonial of worship, which, however, certainly points to the existence of a sacerdotal class. In another passage (x. 97, 22) the importance of a Br\u0101hman to the proper performance of religious rites appears to be clearly expressed. In x. 109, where the words br\u0101hm\u0101n (passim) and br\u0101hma\u1e47a (in v. 4) seem to be used interchangeably\u2014the inviolability of Br\u0101hmans\u2019 wives, the peril of interfering with them, and the blessing attendant on reparation for any outrage committed against them, are referred to in such a way as to shew at once the loftiness of the claims set up by the Br\u0101hmans on their own behalf, and to prove that these pretensions were frequently disregarded by the nobles. In x. 16, 6, the Br\u0101hmans are spoken of as inspired by Soma, and in vi. 75, 10, the manes of earlier Br\u0101hmans are reckoned among those divine beings who have power to protect the suppliant. But in none of these texts is any reference made to the Br\u0101hmans constituting an exclusive caste or race, descended from an ancestor distinct from those of the other classes of their countrymen. In fact, it is proved by one of the additions (cited above) which have been made in the Atharva-veda (v. 17, 8 f.) to one of the hymns just referred to (x. 10, 9), that, even at that later period when that addition was made, Br\u0101hmans had but little regard to the purity of the sacerdotal blood, as they did not intermarry.\n\n1 See M\u00fcller\u2019s remarks on this hymn in his Anc. Sansk. Lit., p. 494.\n2 In R.V. viii. 50, 9, it is said: \u201cWhether an unwise or a wise man, O Indra, has offered to thee a hymn, he has gladdened (thee) through his devotion to thee.\u201d\nwith women of their own order only, or even with women who had previously lived single, but were in the habit of forming unions with the widows of R\u0101janyas or Vaisyas, if they did not even take possession of the wives of such men while they were alive. Even if we suppose these women to have belonged to priestly families, this would only show that it was no uncommon thing for females of that class to be married to R\u0101janyas or Vaisyas\u2014a fact which would, of course, imply that the caste system was either quite unknown, or only beginning to be introduced among the Indians of the earlier Vedic age. That, agreeably to ancient tradition, Br\u0101hmans intermarried with R\u0101janya women at the period in question, is also distinctly shewn by the story of the Rishi Chyavana and Sukany\u0101, daughter of king \u015aary\u0101ta, narrated in the \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and quoted in my former paper, \u201cContributions to a Knowledge of Vedic Mythology,\u201d No. ii., pp. 11 ff. See also the stories of the\n\n---\n\n1 That the remarriage of women was customary among the Hindus of those days is also shewn by A.V. ix. 5, 27 f., quoted in my former paper on Yama, p. 299.\n\nThis latter supposition derives a certain support from the emphasis with which the two verses in question (A.V. v. 17, 8, 9) assert that the Br\u0101hman was the only true husband. Whence, it may be asked, the necessity for this strong and repeated asseveration, if the Rajanya and Vaisya husbands were not still alive, and prepared to claim the restoration of their wives? The verses are, however, explicable without this supposition.\n\nIt is to be observed, however, that no mention is here made of \u015a\u016bdras as a class with which Br\u0101hmans intermarried. \u015a\u016bdras were not \u0100ryas, like the three upper classes. This distinction is not recognised in the following verse of the A.V. xix. 62, 1: Make me dear to gods, dear to princes, dear to every one who beholds me, both to \u015a\u016bdra and to \u0100rya.\u201d (Unless we are to suppose that both here and in xix. 32, 8, \u0101rya = a Vaisya, and not \u0101rya, is the word.) In \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, K\u0101\u1e47va \u015a\u0101kh\u0101 (Adhvara K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, i. 6), the same thing is clearly stated in these words, for a copy of which I am indebted to Professor M\u00fcller:\u2014\u201cTat na sarva eva prapadyeta na hi dev\u0101\u1e25 sarv\u0101iva sangachhante | \u0101rya eva br\u0101hma\u1e47o v\u0101 kshattriya v\u0101 vai\u1e63ya v\u0101 te hi ya\u00f1\u00f1iy\u0101\u1e25 | no eva sarv\u0101iva samvedeta na hi dev\u0101\u1e25 sarv\u0101iva samvedante \u0101ry\u0101n\u0101iva br\u0101hma\u1e47ena v\u0101 kshattriyena v\u0101 vai\u1e63yena v\u0101 te hi ya\u00f1\u00f1iy\u0101\u1e25 | yady enam \u015b\u016bdr\u0101\u1e47a samv\u0101do vindet \u201cittham enam nichakshava\u201d ity anyam br\u0101hma\u1e47a d\u012bk\u1e63hitasyopach\u0101ra\u1e25. \u201cEvery one cannot obtain this (for the gods do not associate with every man), but only an \u0100rya, a Br\u0101hman, or a Kshatriya, or a Vaisya, for these can sacrifice. Nor should one talk with every body (for the gods do not talk with every body), but only with an \u0100rya, a Br\u0101hman, or a Kshatriya, or a Vaisya, for these can sacrifice. If any one have occasion to speak to a \u015a\u016bdra, let him say to another person, \u2018Tell this man so and so.\u2019 This is the rule for an initiated man.\u201d\n\nIn the corresponding passage of the M\u0101dhyandina \u015a\u0101kh\u0101 (p. 224 of Weber\u2019s Edition) this passage is differently recorded.\n\nFrom Manu (ix. 149\u2013167; x. ff.) it is clear that Br\u0101hmans intermarried with \u015a\u016bdra women, though the offspring of these marriages were degraded.\nRishi \u015ay\u0101v\u0101\u1e63va, who married the daughter of king Rathaviti, as told by the commentator on Rig-veda, v. 61, and given in Prof. Wilson's translation, vol. iii. p. 344.\n\nWe have, however, still to consider the single text of the Rig-veda, x. 90, 11, 12, which seems at first sight to prove the existence of a belief in the separate creation of the four castes at the time when it was composed. A careful examination of the context in which these verses are found, or even of the verses themselves, will, however, I think, lead to the conclusion that the representation is allegorical, and implies no opinion regarding the literal origination of the four classes. It is not even said that the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a was produced from the mouth, the R\u0101janya from the arms, or the Vai\u015bya from the thighs of Purusha; but that these classes formed respectively those members of his body. It is the \u015a\u016bdra alone who is asserted to have sprung from the part of the body with which he is associated\u2014the feet.\n\nIt is further to be noticed that as this hymn probably belongs to the close of the Vedic age, no conclusion can, on any interpretation of its meaning, be drawn from it in regard to the opinion regarding the different classes which prevailed in the earlier portion of that era. Dr. Haug, it is true, denies that the hymn is comparatively modern. He thinks that there is no sufficient evidence to prove this, but that, \"on the contrary, reasons might be alleged to shew that it is even old.\" He is of opinion that the hymn had been used at human sacrifices, which he considers to have been customary in the earliest Vedic period, though they were afterwards abandoned as revolting to human feelings (\"Origin of Br\u0101hmanism,\" p. 5). Notwithstanding what is here urged by Dr. Haug, I cannot help agreeing with the opinion stated by other scholars, such as Colebrooke (Essays, i. 309, note; or p. 197 of Williams and Norgate's edition) and Max M\u00fcller (Ancient Sansk. Lit., p. 570 f.), that this hymn is of a later date than the great bulk of the collection in which it is found. As compared\n\n---\n\n1 The entire hymn is translated in my paper on the Progress of the Vedic Religion, pp. 853 ff., and also in \"Sanskrit Texts,\" vol. i. pp. 6 ff., where some remarks are made on it.\nwith by far the larger part of the hymns, it has every character of modernness both in its diction and ideas.\n\nIt is not denied that the hymns which we find in the Rig-veda collection are of very different periods. They themselves speak of newer and older hymns. So many as a thousand compositions of this sort could scarcely have been produced within a very short space of time, and there is no reason to imagine that the literary activity of the ancient Hindus was confined to the age immediately preceding the collection of the hymns. But if we are to recognize any difference of age, what hymns can we more reasonably suppose to be the oldest than those which are at once archaic in language and style, and naive and simple in the character of their conceptions; and on the other hand, what compositions can more properly be set down as the most recent than those which manifest an advance in speculative ideas, while their language approaches to the modern Sanskrit? These latter conditions seem to be fulfilled in the Purusha S\u00fbkta, as well as in hymns x. 71; x. 72; x. 81; x. 82; x. 121; and x. 129. The pantheistic character of the opening parts of the Purusha S\u00fbkta alone would suffice to demonstrate its comparatively recent date.\n\nThat even the legendary genealogies of the Pur\u00e2nas frequently assign to members of the four so-called castes a common origin, has been shown in my Sanskrit Texts, vol. i. chap. ii.; and for the evidence discoverable, both in the Rig-veda itself and in the epic poems and Pur\u00e2nas, that hymns were composed, and sacerdotal functions exercised, by persons who in later ages were called R\u00e2janyas or Kshattriyas, as well as by Br\u00e2hmans, I may refer to the same volume, pp. 86\u2013151 where the stories of Vi\u015bv\u00e2mitra and Dev\u00e2pi are told.\n\nIn later times, when none but Br\u00e2hman priests were known, it seemed to be an unaccountable, and\u2014as contradicting the exclusive sacerdotal pretensions of the Br\u00e2hmans\u2014an inconvenient circumstance, that priestly functions should have been recorded as exercised by R\u00e2janyas; and it therefore became necessary to explain away the historical facts, by inventing miraculous legends to make it appear that these men of the royal\norder had been in reality transformed into Br\u0101hmans, as the reward of their superhuman merits and austerities (see Sanskrit Texts, vol. i., pp. 95 ff., 148 ff.). The very existence, however, of such a word as r\u0101jarshi, or \"royal rishi,\" proves that Indian tradition recognized as rishis or authors of Vedic hymns persons who had belonged to R\u0101janya families. A number of such are named (though without the epithet of r\u0101jarshi) in the Anukrama\u1e47ik\u0101 or index to the Rig-veda; but S\u0101ya\u1e47a, who quotes that old document, gives them this title. Thus, in the introduction to hymn i. 100, he says: \"Rjr\u0101\u015bva and others, sons of V\u1e5b\u1e63h\u0101gir, in all five r\u0101jarshis, saw this hymn in a bodily form (sadeham \u015b\u016bktam dad\u1e5b\u1e63u\u1e25). Hence they are its rishis (or seers).\" The 17th verse of this hymn is as follows: \"This hymn the V\u0101rsh\u0101giras, Rjr\u0101\u015bva, with his attendants Amvar\u012bsha, Sahadeva, Bhayam\u0101na, and Sur\u0101dhas, utter to thee, the vigorous, o Indra, as their homage;\" on which S\u0101ya\u1e47a repeats the remark that these persons were r\u0101jarshis. Ambar\u012bsha is also said to be the rishi of ix. 98. Again, \"Trasadasyu, son of Purukutsa, a R\u0101jarshi,\" is said by S\u0101ya\u1e47a on R.V. iv. 42, to be the rishi of that hymn. In the 9th verse Trasadasyu is thus mentioned: \"Purukuts\u0101ni worshipped you, o Indra and Varuna, with salutations and obeisances; then ye gave her king Trasadasyu, a slayer of enemies, a demigod.\" Similarly S\u0101ya\u1e47a says on v. 27: \"Tryaruna son of Triv\u1e5bshna, Trasadasyu son of Purukutsa, and A\u015bvamedha son of Bharata, these three kings conjoined, are the rishis of this hymn; or Atri is the rishi.\" As the hymn is spoken by a fourth person, in praise of the liberality of these kings, it is clear they cannot well be its authors. However, the Hindu tradition of their being so, is good proof that kings could, in conformity with ancient opinion, be rishis. Trasadasyu and Tryaruna are also mentioned as the rishis of ix. 110.1 The rishis of iv. 43 and iv. 44 are declared by S\u0101ya\u1e47a, and by the Anukrama\u1e47ik\u0101, to be Purumilha, and Ajamilha, sons or descendants of Suhotra. Though these persons\n\n1 In the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a, Tryy\u0101runa, Pushkarin, and Kapi are said to have been sons of Urukhaya, and the last of them to have become a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. In the Matsya P., Tryy\u0101runi, Pushk\u0101r\u0101r\u016b\u1e47i, and Kapi are said to have all become Br\u0101hmans. (Wilson, V. P., p. 461, and note.)\nare not said by either of these authorities to be kings, yet in the Vishnu Purana they are mentioned as being of royal race, and as grandsons of Suhotra, and according to the Bhagavata P. a tribe of Brahmins is said to have been descended from the son of Ajamilha. In the sixth verse of iv. 44, the descendants of Ajamilha are said to have come to the worship of the A\u015bvins. The following hymns are said by tradition to have had the following kings for their rishis, viz.: x. 9, Sindhudwipa, son of Ambarisha (or Trisiras, son of Tvashtir); x. 75, Sindhukshit, son of Priyamedha; x. 133, Sud\u0101s, son of Pijavana; x. 134, M\u00e2ndh\u0101\u1e6dr, son of Yuvar\u0101\u1e63va; x. 179, Sibi, son of U\u1e63inara, Pratardana, son of Divod\u0101sa and king of K\u0101\u015bi, and Vasumanas, son of Rohida\u1e63va; and x. 148 is declared to have had Prthi Vainya as its rishi. In the fifth verse of that hymn it is said: \"Hear, o heroic Indra, the invocation of Prthi; and thou art praised by the hymns of Venya.\" In viii. 9, 10, also, Prthi Vainya is mentioned among rishis: \"Whatever invocation Kakshivat has made to you, or the rishi Vyasa, or Dirghatamas, or Prthi, son of Vena, in the places of sacrifice, take notice of that, o A\u015bvins.\" Here S\u0101yana refers to Prthi as the \"royal rishi of that name.\"\n\nI have observed above that the contents of R.V. x. 109 not only display the high pretensions of the priestly order, but also indicate clearly that those pretensions were often disregarded by the ruling class. In fact, the hymns of the Rigveda contain numerous references to persons, apparently of different descriptions, who were either hostile or indifferent to the system of religious worship which the rishis professed and inculcated. We find there a long list of condemnatory epithets applied to these persons, such as adeva, adevayu, anindra, abrahman, ayajyu, ayajvan, anyavrata, apavrata, avrata, devanid, brahmadvish, etc., etc.; i.e., \"godless,\" \"destitute of Indra,\" \"without devotion,\" \"unsacrificing,\" \"following other rites,\" \"averse to religious rites, or to law,\" \"without rites, or lawless,\" \"revilers of the gods,\" \"haters of\n\n---\n\n1 Even females are said to be authors of hymns or parts of hymns, as Roma\u1e63a, \"daughter of Brhaspati, an utterer of hymns\" (i. 126), Lopamudr\u0101 (i. 179, 1), and Vi\u1e63\u1e47av\u0101r\u0101, of the family of \u0100tri (v. 28).\ndevotion,\" etc. (i. 33, 3, 4; i. 51, 8, 9; i. 101, 2, 4; i. 121, 13; i. 131, 4; i. 132, 4; i. 147, 2; i. 150, 2; i. 174, 8; i. 175, 3; ii. 12, 10; ii. 23, 4, 8, 12; ii. 26, 1; iii. 30, 17; iii. 31, 9; iii. 34, 9; iv. 16, 9; v. 2, 9, 10; v. 20, 2; v. 42, 9, 10; vi. 14, 3; vi. 49, 15; vi. 52, 2, 3; vi. 61, 3; vi. 67, 9; vii. 6, 3; vii. 61, 4; vii. 83, 7; vii. 93, 5; viii. 31, 15 ff.; viii. 45, 23; viii. 51, 12; viii. 53, 1; viii. 59, 7, 10, 11; ix. 41, 2; ix. 63, 24; ix. 73, 5, 8; x. 22, 7 f.; x. 27, 1 ff.; x. 36, 9; x. 38, 3; x. 42, 4; x. 49, 1; x. 160, 4; x. 182, 3.) In most of these passages, no doubt, the epithets in question are connected with the words D\u0101sa or Dasyu, which\u2014whether we understand them of barbarous aboriginal races, then partially occupying the Punjab, or of the evil spirits with which the darkness was peopled by the lively imagination of the early Indians\u2014certainly did not ordinarily designate tribes of Aryan descent. But there are other texts containing denunciations of religious hostility or indifference, where no express reference is made to Dasyus, which may with more or less probability be understood of members of the Aryan community. Such are the following:\n\ni. 84, 7. \"Indra, who alone distributes riches to the sacrificing mortal, is lord and irresistible. 7. When will Indra crush the illiberal (ar\u0101dhasam) man like a bush with his foot? when will he hear our hymns?\"\n\ni. 101, 4. \"Indra, who is the slayer of him, however strong, who offers no libations.\"\n\ni. 122, 9. \"The hostile man, the malicious enemy, who pours out no libations to you, o Mitra and Varu\u1e47a, plants fever in his own heart, when the pious man has by his offerings obtained (your blessing).\"\n\ni. 124, 10. \"Wake, o magnificent Dawn (Ushas), the men who present offerings; let the thoughtless niggards (panayah) sleep.\" (Comp. iv. 51, 3.)\n\ni. 125, 7. \"Let not the liberal suffer evil or calamity; let not devout sages decay; let them have some further term; let griefs befall the illiberal (ap\u1e5b\u1e47antam).\"\n\n1 This sense of the word is confirmed by i. 33, 3, where the rishi says to Indra, \"ma gavir bh\u012br asmad adhi;\" \"Be not niggardly towards us.\"\ni. 147, 2. \"One man contemns (piyati), whilst another praises, thee. Reverent, I adore thy manifestation, o Agni.\"\n\ni. 176, 4. \"Slay every one who offers no oblations\u2014though difficult to destroy\u2014who is displeasing to thee. Give us his wealth; the sage expects it.\"\n\ni. 182, 3. \"What do ye here, o powerful (Asvins)? Why do ye sit in the house of any man who offers no sacrifice, and yet is honoured? Assail, wear away the breath of the niggard (paner asum), and create light for the sage who desires to praise you.\"\n\ni. 190, 5. \"Those persons who, flourishing, but wicked, regarding thee, o god, as a feeble being, depend upon thee who art gracious\u2014thou bestowest nothing desirable upon the malignant, thou, o Brhaspati, avengest thyself on the scorner (piydrum).\"\n\nii. 23, 4. \"By thy wise leadings thou guidest and protectest the man who worships thee: no calamity can assail him who hates devotion (brahma-dvishah), and the queller of his wrath: this, o Brhaspati, is thy great glory.\"\n\nii. 26, 1. \"The upright worshipper shall slay those who seek to slay (him); the godly shall overcome the ungodly; the religious shall slay in battle even him who is hard to conquer; the sacrificer shall divide the spoils of the unsacrificing.\"\n\niv. 24, 2. \"In battle Indra bestows riches upon the man who offers prayers (brahmanyate) and libations. . . . . . 5. Then some men worship the mighty (Indra); then the cooker of oblations will present his offering of meal; then Soma will abandon those who offer no libations; then (the impious) will be fain to worship the vigorous (god).\"\n\niv. 25, 5. \"Dear is the righteous man, dear to Indra is the man who reveres him, dear is the worshipper, dear to him is the offer of soma. 6. This impetuous and heroic Indra regards as peculiarly his own the cooked oblation of the devout soma-offerer; he is not the relation, or friend, or kinsman, of the man who offers no libations; he destroys the prostrate irreligious man. 7. Indra, the soma-drinker, approves not\n\n1 Roth, s.v. understands d\u0101s\u0101nam to mean \"continually.\"\nfriendship with the wealthy niggard (revat\u0101 panind\u0101) who offers no libations.

Professor Aufrecht renders the words atiy\u00e1sya yasht\u00e1, by \"he who tries to outdo us in sacrifices.\" S\u00e1ya\u00f1a, who is followed by Professor Goldst\u00fccker, makes atiy\u00e1ja the name of a rishi.

Both invoke you, Indra and Varu\u1e47a, for the acquisition of spoil (as) in the conflicts where ye protected Sud\u0101s with the Tritsus, when he was assailed by the ten kings. 7. Ten unsacrificing (ayajyavah) kings did not, o Indra and Varuna, vanquish Sud\u0101s. The praises of the men who partake in the sacrificial feast were effectual; the gods were present at their invocations. 8. O Indra and Varuna, ye gave succour to Sud\u0101s when surrounded in the battle of the ten kings, where the devout white-robed Tritsus, with knotted hair, worshipped you with reverence and prayer.\u201d\n\n[In the first verse of this hymn Indra and Varu\u1e47a are said to have slain both the D\u0101sa and \u0100rya enemies of Sud\u0101s. His enemies were therefore in part \u0100ryas, and the ten kings alluded to in the verses I have quoted were no doubt of this race. And yet it is to be observed that in v. 7 they are described as ayajyavah, \u201cunsacrificing.\u201d If, therefore, this expression is to be taken literally, it would follow that these Aryan kings were not worshippers of Indra and Varuna. Perhaps, however, the epithet is only to be understood in a general way, as meaning \u201cungodly.\u201d If we are to take the indefinite word \u201cboth\u201d (ubhay\u0101sah) in verse 6, as meaning\n\n\\(^1\\) Or, \u201ccrush\u201d (vi mreda).\n\"both the contending hosts,\" it would, indeed, result that not only Sud\u00e1s but also the ten kings who were fighting against him offered supplications to the same gods; but this would seem to be in contradiction to the literal sense of the word \"unsacrificing\" in the following verse; and S\u0101yana understands \"both\" to refer to Sud\u00e1s and the Tritsus who were his helpers.\n\nvii. 19, 1. \"Who (Indra) bestows on the man who offers many libations the wealth of the family which does not worship (him).\"\n\nviii. 2, 18.

Maghavat grasps him in his fist,\\footnote{See Prof. Goldst\u00fccker's Sanskrit Lexicon s.v. aratni. S\u0101yana's interpretation of this verse, as there quoted and translated by Prof. G., is as follows: \"Indra manifests himself (to the pious) - (the sacrificer), who, though not wealthy, offers him the soma libation,\u2014him, Indra, the wealthy, holds in his hand (lit. fist, i.e. he protects him), after having defeated (n\u012bh scil. k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a) his enemies; even unsolicited he slays the foes of the Br\u0101hmans.\" I am, I confess, bold enough to consider the rendering I have given in the text as preferable to S\u0101yana's in the parts where mine differs from his. His connection of the negative particle na which follows r\u0101v\u0101n with that word (so as to make it = arev\u0101n), instead of with the verb sunoti, seems forced and unnatural, especially as rich men are often censured as non-sacrificers (as in iv. 26, 7; v. 34, 5, v. 42, 9; viii. 45, 15). Prof. Roth conjecturally interprets arathau nirdandhi\u015bi as meaning \"he finds him out in a corner.\" Prof. Aufrecht would render, \"holds him at arm's length, despises him.\"} and slays the haters of devotion (brahmadvisha\u1e25) though unsolicited.\"\n\nThat the wealthy man here referred to is an \u0100ryan is rendered probable by the tenor of the following text, where the rich man there alluded to, after contemning Indra during a period of security, concludes by invoking the god when he has been terrified into devotion by the manifestations of his power and anger:\n\nviii. 21, 14. \"Thou takest not a rich man for thy friend.

In vi. 47, 16, Indra is said to be the enemy of the prosperous man (edham\u0101nadvit), probably an \u0100rya who rendered him no service.\u00b9\n\nIn two other passages we are even told that doubts were entertained by some in regard to Indra's existence; ii. 12, 5: \"Have faith in that terrible being of whom men ask 'where is he?' and declare that he is not. He destroys the possessions of the foe, etc. . . . . 15. Thou art true, who being irresistible, continually providest food for him who pours out libations and cooks oblations.\"\n\nviii. 89, 3. \"Seeking food, present a hymn to Indra, a true hymn, if he truly exists. 'Indra does not exist,' says some one; 'who has seen him? whom shall we praise?' 'This is I, o worshipping (exclaims Indra), behold me here, I surpass all beings in greatness.'\"\n\nIt seems evident from the preceding texts that the parcus deorum cultor et infrequens was by no means a rare character among the \u0100ryas of the Vedic age, and that the priests found no little difficulty in drawing forth the liberality of their lay contemporaries towards themselves, and in enforcing a due regard to the ceremonials of devotion. It would even appear that the ministers of religion had to encounter a considerable amount of contempt and hostility from the ungodly, for such words as brahmadvish,\u00b2 \"hater of devotion,\" and piy\u0101ru,\n\ndid not follow \u0100ryan rites, but were in the same condition as the Vr\u0101tyas described by him in p. 33, and by Prof. Aufrecht at pp. 138 f. of the same volume, who were admissible by a particular rite within the Brahmanical pale. From Atharva Veda, v. 22, 14, however, it would appear that the Magadhas were regarded by the writer with enmity, and the people designated in the verse before us as Kikatas, are described as hostile or indifferent to \u0100ryan rites. (See Sanskrit Texts ii. 362 ff. and Wilson's note in loco.)\n\n\u00b9 As however it is said in the same verse that Indra subdues the terrible, and brings forward others, it is possible that these expressions may be meant merely to declare Indra's absolute control over the destinies of men, and to describe the Nemesis that overtakes pride, with an indication of the Herodotean idea \u1f41 \u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c6\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2. (Herod. iii. 40; vii. 10, and 46.)\n\n\u00b2 This word brahma-devis might mean either \"hater of priests,\" or \"hater of devotion,\" but in the R.V. it seems to have the latter sense. S\u0101ya\u1e47a, on ii. 23, renders it mantr\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 br\u0101hma\u1e47\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 v\u0101 dev\u0101\u1e25, \"hater of mantras (hymns), or of Br\u0101hmans;\" and similarly, on v. 42, 9, br\u0101hma\u1e47a-devis\u0101\u1e41 mantra-devis\u0101\u1e41 v\u0101, \"hater of Br\u0101hmans or of mantras;\" whilst on iii. 30, 17, he explains it by br\u0101hma\u1e47a-devis\u0101-k\u0101r\u012b\u1e47e, \"hater of Br\u0101hmans;\" and the same on vi. 22, 8; vi.\n\"despiser,\" which seem to be sometimes applied to irreligious \u0100ryas, express something more than passive opposition. It may perhaps be further gathered from a few passages, which I shall now cite, that the recognized \u0100ryan worship of the national gods, Agni, Indra, Varu\u1e47a, etc., was not kept free from a certain admixture of demonolatry borrowed most probably from the aboriginal tribes; and it is indeed easy to conceive, or even a thing to be assumed as natural and necessary, that the religion as well as the language, manners, and customs of the \u0100ryans should, in process of time, have undergone some modification from the close contact into which they must have been brought with these barbarous neighbours.\n\nFrom the first text which I shall quote, and which is ascribed by tradition to the rishi Vasishtha, it seems that that distinguished personage himself had been accused, whether truly or falsely, of worshipping false gods, of familiarity with evil spirits, and the practice of devilish arts. A charge of this kind could scarcely have been made with any chance of being credited, unless such demonolatry was commonly known to have been practised either by him, or by other members of the same community. The passage referred to (R.V. vii. 104, 12 ff.) is as follows: \"The intelligent man can easily discern, (when) true and false words contend together, which of them is true, and which of them is correct. Soma protects the former, and destroys untruth. 13. Soma does not prosper the sinner, nor the man who wields royal power deceitfully.\n\n52, 3; vii. 104, 2; viii. 45, 23; and viii. 53, 1. The context of ii. 23, 4; v. 42, 9; vi. 52, 2, 3; x. 160, 4, seems to be in favour of the sense \"haters of devotion,\" and the other passages contain nothing inconsistent with this interpretation. No use can therefore be made of this word to prove the importance of priests in the Vedic age.\n\n1 The demons mentioned in the Rig-veda are called by various names, such as Rakshas, Y\u0101tu, Y\u0101tudh\u0101na, of which the feminine Y\u0101tudh\u0101n\u012b is also found, and apparently also Dasyus and D\u0101sa. The word p\u0101dchhi (masculine) also occurs in R.V. i. 133, 5, and p\u0101dchhi frequently in the A.V. The Y\u0101tus are conceived as of different kinds, saya-y\u0101tu, ulaka-y\u0101tu, su\u1e63ulaka-y\u0101tu, koka-y\u0101tu, suparna-y\u0101tu, gr\u0101hra-y\u0101tu, the dog-, owl-, vulture-, etc. etc. formed Y\u0101tus (vii. 104, 22); and paph\u0101ry\u016by\u0101tu, perhaps, such as wound with their hoofs (x. 87, 12). Indra and Agni are the destroyers of the Y\u0101tus who seek to disturb and vitiate the sacrifices and to slay those deities (vii. 104, 18, 20 f.; x. 87, 9 ff.). The Y\u0101tus are described as devouring, insatiable, eaters of raw flesh, of the flesh of men and cattle, drinkers of milk, haters of devotion, maleficent, glaring-eyed, furious, the offspring of darkness (vii. 104 and x. 87 passim).\nHe slays the Rakshas, he slays the liar, they both sleep in the fetters of Indra. 14. If I am either one whose gods are false,\u00b9 or if I have conceived of the gods untruly;\u2014why art thou angry with us, o J\u0101tavedas; let slanderers fall into thy destruction. 15. May I die to-day if I am a Y\u0101tudh\u0101na, or if I have injured any man's life. Then let him be separated from his ten sons, who falsely addresses to me (the words) 'o Y\u0101tudh\u0101na.' 16. He who addresses to me who am no Y\u0101tu\u00b2 (the words), 'o Y\u0101tudh\u0101na,' or who (being) himself a Rakshas says, 'I am pure;'\u00b3 let Indra slay him with his mighty bolt; let him sink down the lowest of all creatures.\" S\u0101ya\u1e47a in his note on v. 12 refers to a legend according to which a R\u0101kshasa had taken the form of Vasishtha, and killed a hundred sons of that rishi, and that these verses were uttered by Vasishtha to repel the charge of his having been possessed by the demon. This legend, however, which was no doubt manufactured to explain the verses, does not in reality answer this purpose. And it would seem, as I have above assumed, that Vasishtha, or the speaker in these verses, whoever he may have been, had been charged with worshipping false gods, and with being under the influence of demons; and that while repelling the accusation, he here retorts upon his accuser by calling him a Rakshas.\n\nAgain in vii. 34, 8, the rishi says: \"I who am no Y\u0101tu (undemoniacal) invoke the gods; fulfilling (the ceremony) in due form, I offer a hymn.\" In another place\u2074 (vii. 21, 5) it is said: \"Neither, o Indra, have Y\u0101tus inspired\u2075\n\n\u00b9 Anrta-deva\u1e25; i.e. asatya-bh\u016bt\u0101 dev\u0101 yasya, \"one whose gods are untrue, or unreal\" (S\u0101ya\u1e47a). Prof. Goldst\u00fccker s.v. interprets the word as meaning, \"one to whom the gods are untrue.\" Prof. Max M\u00fcller renders the phrase, \"If I had worshipped false gods.\" Prof. Roth who had originally s.v. taken the word to mean \"a false prayer,\" withdraws this sense, and adheres to that given by S\u0101ya\u1e47a, at the close of his article on deva.\n\u00b2 Roth s.v. explains the word ay\u0101tu as meaning, \"not demoniacal, free from demoniacal (magic).\" Goldst\u00fccker s.v. defines the word, \"a no-demon, a being different from, or the reverse of, a fiend.\"\n\u00b3 See Prof. Goldst\u00fccker's Dict. s.v. ay\u0101tu.\n\u2074 Quoted with its context in Sanskrit Texts, iv. 345.\n\u2075 Or, \"impelled,\" j\u012bjv\u0101ru\u1e25. This is the sense given by Roth s.v. who explains the words thus: \"Demons do not impel us:\" i.e. \"We are not in league with demons.\" Compare deva-j\u016bta, \"god-inspired,\" or \"god-impelled,\" applied to\nLet the lord (Indra) triumph over the hostile race; let no priapic (or long-tailed) demons, approach our ceremony.\"\n\nIn vi. 62, 8, a person characterized as rakshoyuj is devoted to the vengeance of the gods. The commentator explains the term as either \"the lord, or the instigator, of demons, or a priest possessed of, or by, demons\" (Rakshases).\n\nIn vii. 85, 1, the word arakshas is used in a sense perhaps akin to that of ay\u0101tu: \"I consecrate (or polish, punishe) for you twain an undemoniacal (arakshasam) hymn, offering a libation of soma to Indra and Varu\u1e47a.\" The same word is also employed in viii. 90, 8, where the A\u1e63vins are thus addressed: \"Since we offer to you an undemoniacal gift (r\u0101tim arakshasam),\" etc. Compare ii. 10, 5; v. 87, 9.\n\nIf we should assign to the words Rakshaso devaritau in R.V. v. 42, 10 (a passage quoted above), the sense of \"the sacrifice offered to a Rakshas,\" the preceding conclusions would be still further confirmed.\n\nIf such demonolatry really existed to any extent among the \u0100ryas, it is quite conceivable (I throw this out as a mere conjecture), that the intense hatred of the evil spirits whom, under the appellations of Y\u0101tudh\u0101nas, Rakshases, Asuras, etc., Agni, Indra, and other deities, are so frequently represented in the R. V. (i. 133; iii. 15, 1;\n\nVisv\u0101mitra in iii. 53, 9; and, on the other hand, dasyujutaya in vi. 24, 8, where it is said: \"Indra does not bow to the strong nor the firm, nor to the bold man compelled by a Dasyu (or evil spirit).\"\n\nThe sense of the following words na vandana vedyabhih is obscure.\n\nS\u016bnadev\u0101h. The same word occurs in x. 99, 3: \"When, irresistible, he conquered by his force the treasures of the (city) with a hundred gates, slaying the priapic (or long-tailed) demons.\" (See Sanskrit Texts, iv. 346). If this word s\u016bnadeva is correctly rendered as above, the demons in question may have some affinity with the Gandharvas, who are represented as objects of approbation in A.V. iv. 37, in consequence of their propensity for women, whom, though themselves hairy like dogs or monkeys, they attempted to seduce by assuming an agreeable form (vv. 11, 12). The author of the hymn accordingly wishes that they may be emasculated (v. 7). [Professor Aufrecht thinks that s\u016bnadev\u0101h, being a bahuvr\u012bhi compound, must mean \"lascivious\" (pi\u015b\u0101m devo yesh\u0101m).] These Gandharvas are also described (rv. 8, 9) as havir-ad\u0101n, \"eaters of oblations.\" In A.V. xviii. 2, 28, the Dasyus (who must here be demons) are spoken of as mingling with the Pitris under the appearance of friends, though they had no right to partake in the oblations; and Agni is besought to drive them away from the sacrifice. Compare the disputes regarding the admission of Rudra to a share in sacrifices, Sanskrit Texts, iv. 203, 241, 312 ff.\nvii. 13, 1; vii. 15, 10; vii. 104; viii. 23, 13; viii. 43, 2\nx. 87; x. 187, 3, etc.) as destroying or chasing away from\nthe sacrifices which they disturbed and polluted (vii. 104,\nx. 87, 9, 11), may not have been inspired by the dread which\nthe superstitious worshippers entertained of those goblins,\nmuch as by the fact that they were rival objects of adoration\nfor whom their votaries claimed a share in the oblation;\nwhilst the adherents of the gods described their patrons\ntriumphing by their superior power over the hostile intruders\nand their magical arts (vii. 104, 20, 21, 24; x. 87, 19).\u00b9\n\nIs it possible to look upon Rudra as having been originally\na demon worshipped by the aborigines as the lord of evil\nspirits, and subsequently introduced into the Aryan worship?\nAnd that he was then, as well as originally, supplicated\nto abstain from inflicting those evils of which he was regarded\nas the author, and flattered by being addressed as the great\nhealer of those sufferings which had their origin in his malevolence? (See the reference made to the late Rev. J.\nStevenson's paper on the \"Ante-Brahmanical Religion of\nHindus,\" and to Lassen's Ind. Antiq. in Sanskrit Texts,\np. 344). His malignant, homicidal, and cattle-destroying character (R.V. iv. 3, 6; i. 114, 10, Sanskrit Texts iv. 35)\nassimilates him to the Rakshasas and Y\u0101tudh\u0101nas (though\nit is true that they are not, as he is, specifically described as\ninflicters of disease and death); and he is described in\n\u015aatarudriya (V\u0101j. S. xvi. 8, 20), as having attendants\n(satv\u0101na\u1e25), while in A.V. xiii. 4, 27, all the Y\u0101tus are said\nto obey his commands, and in v. 25 of the same hymn he\nis declared to be death, and immortality, vastness (abhvam),\nand a Rakshas (sa eva m\u1e5btyu\u1e25 so 'm\u1e5btam so 'bhvam sa rak\u1e63a\u1e25);\nand in xi. 2, 30 f., reverence is offered to his wide-mouthed howling dogs, and to his shouting, long-haired, devouring armies.\nIt is true that in the 11th verse of the same hymn he is asked\nto drive away dogs and shrieking female (demons) with\n\n\u00b9 Perhaps, however, it is unnecessary to resort to this supposition in order\nto account for the dread and hatred of Rakshases which prevailed in the Vedic\ntimes. Such horror and hatred of demons appear to be natural to men in a certain stage\nof civilization. See Lecky's History of the Rise and Progress of Rationalism,\ni. 17 f.\nbevelled hair; that in A.V. iv. 28, 5, Bhava (a deity akin to, or identical with, Rudra) and Sarva are solicited to destroy the Y\u0101tudh\u0101na who uses incantations (compare x. 1, 23) and makes men mad; that in Vaj. 16, 5, Rudra is besought to drive away Y\u0101tudhanis; that in A.V. xi. 2, 28, Bhava is asked to be gracious to the sacrificer who has faith in the existence of the gods, and in v. 23 is said to destroy the contemners of the deities who offer them no sacrifice;\u2014all of these latter traits being common to him with the other Vedic gods. If, however, Rudra really represents a god or demon borrowed by the \u0100ryas from the aborigines, it was to be expected that when adopted by the former he would be invested with the general characteristics which they assigned to their other deities, and that his connection with the evil spirits, of whom he was originally the chief, should as far as possible be kept out of sight and ultimately forgotten.\n\nIt is true that this theory leaves unexplained the connection of Rudra with the Maruts, in conformity with which he ought to be the god of tempests. (See the extract from Weber's Ind. Stud. in Sansk. Texts, iv. 334 ff.). But Rudra may be a composite character, and modified by the addition of heterogeneous elements in the course of ages.\n\nThere is no proof in the Rig-veda that the introduction of the worship of Rudra, even if it was more recent than that of the other Vedic gods, was met with any opposition. But we find there are hints that the adoration of the Rudras or Maruts was regarded as an innovation. These deities are described in many places (see my paper, \"Contributions to a Knowledge of Vedic Theogony,\" etc., p. 110), as the sons of Rudra and Pr\u1e63ni, and might, therefore, be supposed to have had some connection with Rudra. In one passage, too, (R.V. vii. 56, 17), a cattle-destroying and homicidal character (goh\u0101 n\u1e5b\u1e25\u0101 vadho vah), akin to his, is ascribed to them. On the other hand, they are frequently represented as in close relation with Indra; and in fact it is almost inevitable that these deities of the tempest should be associated with the Thunderer, who could scarcely fulfil his function as dispenser of rain without their co-operation. But there are some hymns,\nviz., the 165th, the 170th, and the 171st, of the first Mandala, in which Indra is introduced as regarding them with jealousy, and as resenting the worship which was paid to them. Thus in i. 160, 6 ff., he boasts that he is quite independent of their aid, while they reply that their assistance had been of importance to his success in battle. (Compare viii. 7, 31, and viii. 85, 7; iv. 18, 11). Again, in i. 170, Indra, who complains (v. 3) that the rishi Agastya was despising him and neglecting his worship, is besought (v. 2) to come to terms with the Maruts, and to associate with them at the sacrifice (v. 5); and in i. 171, 4, the rishi asks forgiveness from the Maruts, because, through dread of Indra, he had discontinued the sacrifice which he had begun in their honour. From all this it would seem as if the worshippers of Indra had entertained some objection to the adoration of the Maruts, and ascribed to the god the aversion to it which they themselves entertained. If there is any truth in the hypothesis that Rudra may have originally been a deity or demon who was introduced from the worship of the aborigines into that of their Aryan conquerors, the same may have been the case with the Rudras or Maruts, the sons of Rudra. Only, if this be the fact, these gods have been transformed in character in the course of their reception into the Indian pantheon, and rehabilitated by the ascription to them of different functions and milder attributes than those which belonged to them as deities, or demons of the aborigines.\n\nThe supposition which I have here made of the gradual transformation of Rakshasas into deities, is illustrated by the story told in the Mahabharata of the Raksha Jar\u00e2, who is called a household goddess, and is represented as seeking to requite by benefits the worship which was paid to her. (See Sanskrit Texts, iv. 247).\n\nI have already quoted from the Atharva-veda (v. 17) some evidence of the greater development which the Brahmanical pretensions had received subsequently to the age when the greater part of the Rig-veda was composed. Farther illustration of the same point may be found in the two hymns which follow the one just referred to, viz., A.V. v. 18, and\nv. 19, which have been already translated in my former paper, \"Miscellaneous Hymns from the Rig and Atharva Vedas,\" pp. 34 ff.). There is another section of the same Veda, xii. 5, in which curses similar to those in the last two hymns are fulminated against the oppressors of Br\u0101hmans. The following are specimens: \"4. Prayer (brahm\u0101n) is the chief (thing); the Br\u0101hman is the lord (adhipati). 5. From the Kshattriya who takes the priest's cow, and oppresses the Br\u0101hman, (6) there depart piety (s\u016brya), valour, good fortune, (7) force, keenness, vigour, strength, speech, energy, prosperity, virtue, (8) prayer (brahman), royalty, kingdom, subjects, splendour, renown, lustre, wealth, (9) life, beauty, name, fame, inspiration and expiration, sight, hearing, (10) milk, juice, food, eating, righteousness, truth, oblation, sacrifice, offspring, and cattle;\u2014(11) all these things depart from the Kshattriya who takes the priest's cow. 12. Terrible is the Br\u0101hman's cow, filled with deadly poison.... 13. In her reside all dreadful things and all forms of death, (14) all cruel things, and all forms of homicide. 15. When taken, she binds in the fetters of death the oppressor of priests and despiser of the gods.\" A great deal more follows to the same effect, which it would be tiresome to quote.\n\nI subjoin some further texts of the Atharva-veda in which reference is made to priests (brahm\u0101n) and Br\u0101hmans, and as I suppose these two words had by this period become nearly synonymous, there will no longer be any sufficient reason for separating the passages in which they respectively occur.\n\niv. 6, 1. \"The Br\u0101hman was born the first, with ten heads and ten faces. He first drank the soma; he made poison powerless.\"\n\nIn xix. 22, 21 (= xix. 23, 30) it is similarly said: \"Powers are assembled, of which prayer (or sacred science, brahman) is the chief. Prayer in the beginning stretched out the sky.\n\n---\n\n1 I may mention for the benefit of any Indian Student who may see this article that this hitherto undiscovered variety of Br\u0101hman, who was never anything but a \"sky-flower,\" created by the prolific imagination of the author of this verse, was not again heard of, as far as I am aware, till he was resuscitated as R\u0101vana by the author of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and his followers, who describe the enemy of R\u0101ma and ravisher of S\u012bt\u0101 as a monstrous Br\u0101hman with ten heads.\nThe priest (brahm\u0101n) was born the first of beings. Who, then, ought to vie with the priest?\"\n\nA superhuman power appears to be ascribed to the priest in the following passages,\u2014unless by priest we are to understand Brhaspati:\n\nxix. 9, 12. \"May a prosperous journey be granted to me by prayer, Praj\u0101pati, Dh\u0101tri, the worlds, the Vedas, the seven rishis, the fires; may Indra grant me felicity, may the priest (brahman) grant me felicity.\"\n\nxix. 43, 8. \"May the priest conduct me to the place whither the knowers of prayer (or of sacred science) go by initiation and austerity. May the priest impart to me sacred science.\"\n\nThe wonderful powers of the Brahmach\u0101rin, or student of sacred science, are described in a hymn (A.V. xi. 5), parts of which are translated in my paper on the progress of the Vedic Religion, pp. 374 ff.\n\nAnd yet with all this sacredness of his character the priest must be devoted to destruction, if, in the interest of an enemy, he was seeking by his ceremonies to effect the ruin of the worshipper.\n\nv. 8, 5, \"May the priest whom these men have placed at their head (as a purohita) for our injury, fall under thy feet, o Indra; I hurl him away to death\" (compare A.V. vii. 70, 1 ff.).\nI am led to make some remarks on the subject of this paper by a passage in Mr. Cowell's preface to the fourth volume of the late Professor Wilson's translation of the Rig-veda, which appears to me unduly to depreciate the services which have already been rendered by those eminent scholars both in Germany and in England who have begun to apply the scientific processes of modern philology to the explanation of this ancient hymn-collection. Mr. Cowell admits (p. vi.),\u2014\n\n\"As Vaidik studies progress, and more texts are published and studied, fresh light will be thrown on these records of the ancient world; and we may gradually attain a deeper insight into their meaning than the medi\u00e6val Hindus could possess, just as a modern scholar may understand Homer more thoroughly than the Byzantine scholiasts.\"\n\nBut he goes on to say:\u2014\n\n\"It is easy to depreciate native commentators, but it is not so easy to supersede them; and while I would by no means uphold S\u0101yana as infallible, I confess that, in the present early stage of Vaidik studies in Europe, it seems to me the safer course to follow native tradition rather than to accept too readily the arbitrary conjectures which continental scholars so often hazard.\"\n\nWithout considering it necessary to examine, or defend, all the explanations of particular words proposed by the foreign lexicographers alluded to by Mr. Cowell, I yet venture to think that those scholars have been perfectly justified in commencing at once the arduous task of expounding the Veda on the principles of interpretation which they have adopted and enunciated. This task is, no doubt\u2014(as those who undertake it themselves confess)\u2014one which will only be properly accomplished by the critical labours of many scholars, I may even say, of several successive generations. This is clear, if any proof were wanted, from the parallel case of the Old\nTestament; on the interpretation of which Hebraists, after all the studies of many centuries, are yet far from having said their last word. But what are those texts, and additional materials and appliances which Mr. Cowell desires to have within reach before we are to suffer ourselves to distrust the authority of native commentators, and to make any efforts to attain that deeper insight into the meaning of the Vedas which he feels to be desirable? The Rig-veda, as every one admits, stands alone in its antiquity, and in the character of its contents, and must therefore, as regards its more peculiar and difficult portions, be interpreted mainly through itself. To apply in another sense the words of its commentator, it shines by its own light, and is self-demonstrating.\\(^1\\) But the whole text of the Rig-veda Sanhita has been already published with the commentary on the first eight books. The texts of the Sama-veda (which contains only a few verses which are not in the Rig-veda) and of the White Yajur-veda, have also been printed. It is true that only a part of the Black Yajur-veda has yet been given to the world, but there is no reason to suppose that it contains any very large amount of matter which will throw light on the real sense of the older hymns. Besides, we already possess in print the texts of the two most important Br\u00e2manas, and a portion of a third, so that any aid which can be derived from them is also at our command. But even if additional materials of greater value than are ever likely to be brought to light were still inaccessible, why should not competent scholars proceed at once, with the very considerable means which they already possess, to lay the foundation of a true interpretation of the Rig-veda, leaving the mistakes which they may now commit to be corrected by their own future researches, or by those of their successors, when further helps shall have become available? Ars longa vita brevis.\n\nI propose in the course of this paper to show, by a selection of instances from the Nirukta, and from S\u00e2yana's commentary, the unsatisfactory character of the assistance which those works afford for explaining many of the most difficult\n\n\\(^1\\) See M\u00fcller's Rig-veda, vol. i., p. 4, lines 21ff.\npassages of the hymns, and the consequent necessity which exists that all the other available resources of philology should be called into requisition to supply their deficiencies. But before proceeding to this part of my task, I wish to allow the representatives of the different schools of Vedic interpretation to state their own opinions on the subject under consideration.\n\nProfessor Wilson professes to have based his translation of the hymns of the Rig-veda on the commentary of S\u0101ya\u1e47a Acharya, who lived in the fourteenth century of the Christian era, and on whose work he remarks that\u2014\n\n\"Although the interpretation of S\u0101ya\u1e47a may be occasionally questioned, he undoubtedly had a knowledge of his text far beyond the pretensions of any European scholar, and must have been in possession, either through his own learning or that of his assistants, of all the interpretations which had been perpetuated by traditional teaching from the earliest times.\"\u2014Introduction to Translation of Rig-veda Sanhita (published in 1850), vol. i., p. xlix.\n\nAnd in a note to his translation of the 10th hymn of the 1st Book (vol. i., p. 25) he observes, on certain proposed renderings of Prof. Roth and M. Langlois, that \"S\u0101ya\u1e47a, no doubt, knew much better than either of the European interpreters what the expression intended.\" In the introduction to his second vol., p. xix. (published in 1854), Prof. Wilson returns to the subject, and remarks, among other things, as follows:\n\n\"With respect to unusual words, there are no doubt a great number employed in the Veda, and it is possible that the lexicographic significations given by the commentators may be sometimes questionable, sometimes contradictory; but from what other authority can a satisfactory interpretation be derived? It has been supposed that a careful collation of all the passages in which such words occur might lead to a consistent and indisputable interpretation; but this assumes that they have always been employed with precision and uniformity by the original authors, a conclusion that would scarcely be tenable even if the author were one individual, and utterly untenable when, as is the case with the Suktas, the authors are indefinitely numerous: it is very improbable, therefore, that even such collation would remove all perplexity on this account,\"\nalthough it might occasionally do so; at any rate such a concordance has still to be established, and until it is effected we may be satisfied with the interpretation given us by the most distinguished native scholars, availing themselves of all the Vaidik learning that had preceded them,\" etc. etc.\n\nAgain in p. xxii. he says:\u2014\n\n\"The more unmanageable difficulties are those which are utterly insuperable except by guess: they are not the perplexities of commission, but of omission: not the words or phrases that are given, but those that are left out: the constant recurrence of the abuse of ellipsis and metonymy, requiring not only words, but sometimes sentences, to be supplied by comment or conjecture, before any definite meaning can be given to the expressions that occur. . . . . It may not always require extraordinary ingenuity to hit upon what is intended by such elliptical expressions from correlative terms or context; but such a mode of interpretation by European scholars, whose ordinary train of thinking runs in a very different channel from that of Indian scholarship, can scarcely claim equal authority with the latter,\" etc.\n\nIn regard to one of these elliptical texts, Prof. Wilson expresses himself very unhesitatingly when he says (p. xxiii.):\n\n\"The original author alone could say with confidence that he meant 'rivers,' which thenceforward became the traditional and admitted explanation, and is, accordingly, so supplied by the scholiast.\"\n\nIn the following passage (p. xxv.), however, Prof. Wilson admits that it is doubtful whether these explanations had always actually come down from the age of the authors of the hymns:\u2014\n\n\"How far his\" (i.e. the author's) \"lecture and amplification may have been preserved uncorrupted through successive generations, until they reached Y\u0101ska, and eventually S\u0101yana, may be reasonably liable to question; but that the explanations of these scholiasts were not arbitrary, but were such as had been established by the practice of preceding schools, and were generally current at their several eras, can admit of no doubt. Even if it were not so, their undeniable learning and their sympathy with the views and feelings of their countrymen, amongst whom were the original authors and expounders of the S\u016bktas, must give a weight to their authority which no European scholar, however profound his know-\nedge of Sanskrit or of the Vedas, can, in my opinion, be entitled to claim.\"\n\nThe following is Prof. Rudolph Roth's explanation of the system which he has pursued in the interpretation of Vedic words in the great Sanskrit and German Lexicon published by himself and Dr. Boehtlingk. I translate from the preface to the first vol. of the Lexicon published in 1855:\n\n\"As the aids furnished to us by recent authors for the understanding of the Vedic texts are but scanty, we are the more dependent on the contributions made to their interpretation by Indian scholarship itself, i.e., on the commentaries. And, in fact, so far as regards one of the branches of Vedic literature, the treatises on theology and worship, we can desire no better guides than these commentators, exact in all respects, who follow their texts word by word, who, long as even the semblance of a misconception might arise, are never weary of repeating what they have frequently said before, and who often appear as if they had been writing for us foreigners rather than for their own priestly alumni who had grown up in the midst of these conceptions and impressions. Here, where their task is to explain the widely-ramified, ingenious, and often far-fetched symbolism of their ceremonial, to elucidate the numberless minutiae on the observance of which in religious worship, eternal salvation or salvation depends, they are on their proper ground. For in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as there breathes the same spirit which works downward through the whole course of orthodox Indian theology, and in particular has pervaded those Brahmanical schools which some centuries ago were so zealously engaged in investigating and explaining the most prominent treatises of their ancient theological literature.\n\n\"The case, however, is quite different when the same men assume the task of interpreting the ancient collections of hymns. These texts are not the creations of theological speculation, nor have they sprung out of the soil of that rigidly prescribed, minute, liturgical ceremonial to which we have alluded, but they are for the most part productions of the oldest religious-lyrical poetry, the artistic cultivation of which was as little confined to particular families or castes as was the offering of daily sacrifice and prayer: in them a world of deities lives, and a worship is mirrored, which are essentially distinct from the system taught in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as; they speak a language divided from that of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as (which scarcely differs from the so-called classical Sanskrit) by a chasm as wide as that which separates the Latin of...\"\nthe Salic hymns from that of M. Terentius Varro. Here, therefore, there were required not only quite different qualifications for interpretation, but also a freedom of judgment and a greater breadth of view and of historical intuitions. Freedom of judgment, however, was wanting to priestly learning among all the nations of heathen antiquity, whilst in India no one has ever had any conception of historical development.\n\n\"Thus the very qualities which have made those commentators excellent guides to an understanding of the theological treatises, render them unsuitable conductors on that far older and quite differently circumstanced domain. As the so-called classical Sanskrit was perfectly familiar to them, they sought its ordinary idiom in the Vedic hymns also. Since any difference in the ritual appeared to them inconceivable, and the present forms were believed to have existed from the beginning of the world, they fancied that the patriarchs of the Indian religion must have sacrificed in the very same manner. As the recognized mythological and cosmical systems of their own age appeared to them unassailable and revealed verities, they must necessarily (so the commentators thought) be discoverable in that centre-point of revelation, the hymns of the ancient Rishis, who had, indeed, lived in familiar intercourse with the gods, and possessed far higher wisdom than the succeeding generations.\n\n\"It is unnecessary to enlarge on this state of things, or to illustrate it by examples.\" Nor will it be expected that we should here indicate at length the very considerable advantage which is derivable from the works of these interpreters, in spite of all their imperfections. The whole state of the case is neither difficult to recognise, nor singular in its kind. The sacred books of the ancient nations were, as a general rule, explained in the same manner by later generations according to the prevailing systems of theology and the higher or lower state of science; and in every case this interpretation was given out as being a tradition, that is, it claimed for itself an antiquity and a dignity of which it could not always boast with truth. Besides, to give an example, it has never occurred to anyone to make our understanding of the Hebrew books of the Old Testament depend on the Talmud and the Rabbins, while there are\n\n1 [Though Prof. Roth does not consider it necessary to give instances in proof of his assertions, I may allude to the way in which S\u0101yana considers the dwarf-incarnation of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to be referred to in R.V. i. 22 16 ff., and identifies the Rudra of the hymns with the husband of P\u0101rvat\u012b; see his note on R.V. i. 114, 6; and Sanskrit Texts, iv. 57 and 257. Y\u0101ska, however, and the older authors referred to by him, Nir. xii. 19, seem to know, or, at least, they say, nothing of the dwarf-incarnation.\u2014J.M.]\nnot wanting scholars who hold it as the duty of a conscientious interpreter of the Veda to translate in conformity with S\u0101yana, Mah\u0101dhara, etc. Consequently, we do not believe, like H. H. Wilson, that S\u0101yana, for instance, understood the expressions of the Veda better than any European interpreter; but we think that a conscientious European interpreter may understand the Veda far better and more correctly than S\u0101yana. We do not esteem it our first task to arrive at that understanding of the Veda which was current in India some centuries ago, but to search out the sense which the poets themselves have put into their hymns and utterances. Hence we are of opinion that the writings of S\u0101yana and the other commentators do not form a rule for the interpreter, but are merely one of those helps of which the latter will avail himself for the execution of his undoubtedly difficult task, a task which is not to be accomplished at the first onset, or by any single individual.\n\n\"We have, therefore, endeavoured to follow the path prescribed by philology, to derive from the texts themselves the sense which they contain, by a juxtaposition of all the passages which are cognate in diction or contents;\u2014a tedious and laborious path, in which neither the commentators nor the translators have preceded us. The double duty of exegete and lexicographer has thus devolved upon us. A simply etymological procedure, practised as it must be by those who seek to divine the sense of a word from the sole consideration of the passage before them, without regard to the ten or twenty other passages in which it recurs, cannot possibly lead to a correct result. Such a procedure, even if practised in conformity with philological principles, moves in far too wide logical circles to admit of its always hitting the right point, and gives rise to conceptions which are far too general and colourless, which, perhaps, indeed, include within them the firmly defined and sharply stamped meaning which the word contains, but fail to reproduce it in its peculiarity, and therefore in its power and beauty.\n\n\"Of this nature is the procedure which the commentators have adopted, and whereby they clearly demonstrate that they have not simultaneously mastered the entire vocabulary of these books, and at the same time that they have not handled the individual passages according to any fixed traditional interpretation. Hence it happens that they have assigned to a large number of nouns in the Veda the sense of power, sacrifice, food, wisdom, etc., and to many verbs, that of going, moving, etc., when all these words are distinct from one\n\n1 [The Nighantu ii., 14, contains no less than 122 verbs, to which the sense of going is assigned.\u2014J.M.]\nanother, have a definite value and a clear significance of their own, and in many cases have scarcely the most distant connection with those general conceptions. And it is only by the reinstatement of these misapprehended words in their lost rights that the Veda acquires a striking meaning, force, and richness of expression, and gives us an entirely different image of the world of thought in the earliest antiquity.\n\n\"No one who knows the difficulties of such an occupation will refuse us indulgence for our undoubtedly numerous mistakes, mistakes which, in the progress of the work, will become first and most distinctly manifest to ourselves.\"\n\nI have considered it proper to give this long extract from the preface to the St. Petersburg Lexicon, as though Prof. Roth is by no means the sole representative of the school of interpretation which he here defends, he has, by the compilation of the large portion of his Dictionary which has already appeared, done far more than any other Sanskritist has yet accomplished to carry his principles into practice.\n\nBefore adverting to the criticism which this passage has received from Prof. Goldst\u00fccker, I shall make a short quotation from Prof. Max M\u00fcller's preface to the 3rd vol. of his Rig-veda, which must be understood as laying down principles of interpretation similar to those which are advocated by Roth. After remarking that \"the conviction seems to be growing more and more general, that without this (S\u0101yana's) Commentary an accurate and scholarlike knowledge of the Veda could never have been obtained;\" M\u00fcller goes on to say:\n\n\"It would have been equally wrong, however, to consider S\u0101yana's commentary as an infallible authority with regard to the interpretation of the Veda. S\u0101yana gives the traditional, but not the original, sense of the Vaidik hymns. . . . If, therefore, we wish to know how the Brahmans, from the time of the composition of the first Br\u0101hma\u1e47a to the present day, understood and interpreted the hymns of their ancient Rishis, we ought to translate them in strict accordance with S\u0101yana's gloss. . . . Nor could it be said that the tradition of the Brahmans, which S\u0101yana embodied in his work, after the lapse of at least three thousand years, had changed the whole character of the Rig-veda. By far the greater part of these hymns is so simple and straightforward, that there can be no doubt\nthat their original meaning was exactly the same as their traditional interpretation. But no religion, no poetry, no law, no language can resist the tear and wear of thirty centuries; and in the Veda, as in other works, handed down to us from a very remote antiquity, the sharp edges of primitive thought, the delicate features of a young language, the fresh hue of unconscious poetry, have been washed away by the successive waves of what we call tradition, whether we look upon it as a principle of growth or decay. To restore the primitive outlines of the Vaidik period of thought will be work of great difficulty.\u201d pp. vii., f. He then goes on to quote a passage from a previous essay of his own, in which, after laying it down as a rule that, \u201cnot a corner of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, the S\u016btras, Y\u0101ska, and S\u0101ya\u1e47a should be left unexplored before we venture to propose a rendering of our own,\u201d he, a little further on, proceeds thus:\n\n\u201cTo make such misunderstandings\u201d (as are found in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as) possible, we must assume a considerable interval between the composition of the hymns and the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as. As the authors of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as were blinded by theology, the authors of the still later Niruktas were deceived by etymological fictions, and both conspired to mislead by their authority later and more sensible commentators, such as S\u0101ya\u1e47a. Where S\u0101ya\u1e47a has no authority to mislead him, his Commentary is at all events rational; but still his scholastic notions would never allow him to accept the free interpretation which a comparative study of these venerable documents forces upon the unprejudiced scholar. We must therefore discover ourselves the real vestiges of these ancient poets,\u201d etc.\n\nI now come to Prof. Goldst\u00fccker\u2019s strictures (P\u0101\u1e47ini, pp. 241 ff.) on the principles of Vedic interpretation laid down by Prof. Roth. He thus expresses his opinion of the value, and of the method, of the Indian commentators:\n\n\u201cWithout the vast information these commentators have disclosed to us,\u2014without their method of explaining the obscurest texts,\u2014in one word, without their scholarship, we should still stand at the outer doors of Hindu antiquity. . . . The whole religious life of ancient India is based on tradition. . . . Tradition tells us, through the voice of the commentators, who re-echo the voice of their ancestors, how the nation, from immemorial times, understood the sacred texts, what inferences they drew from them, what influence they allowed them to exercise on their religious, philosophical, ethical,\u2014in a word, on their national, development. . . . But it would be utterly erroneous to assume that a scholar like S\u0101ya\u1e47a, or even a copy of him, like Mahidhara, contented himself with being\nthe mouthpiece of his predecessors or ancestors. They not only record the sense of the Vaidik texts and the sense of the words of which these texts consist, but they endeavour to show that the interpretations which they give are consistent with the grammatical requirements of the language itself.\"\n\nProf. Goldst\u00fccker then quotes (pp. 245 f.) a portion of the remarks of Prof. Roth which I have cited above, and proceeds to controvert a statement, which he ascribes to that scholar, that S\u0101ya\u1e47a and the other commentators give us \"only that sense of the Veda which was current in India some centuries ago:\"\u2014\n\n\"A bolder statement,\" writes Prof. Goldst\u00fccker (p. 248), \"I defy any scholar to have met with in any book. S\u0101ya\u1e47a incessantly refers to Y\u0101ska. All his explanations show that he stands on the ground of the oldest legends and traditions,\u2014of such traditions, moreover, as have no connection whatever with the creeds of those sects which represent the degenerated Hindu faith of his time.\"\n\nProf. Goldst\u00fccker then goes on (pp. 248 ff.) to argue that Prof. Roth, from imperfect acquaintance with the labours of the Indian commentators, is not entitled to depreciate their qualifications for the correct interpretation of the Veda, or to assert the superior fitness of European scholars for this task; rejects as absurd the idea of the former not being able, as well as the latter, to bring together and compare all the passages in which particular words occur; maintains that in the case of those words which occur but once in the Veda, and in regard to which, therefore, no comparison with other passages is possible, the guesses of S\u0101ya\u1e47a are as good as those of his critic; reiterates his opinion that S\u0101ya\u1e47a's method of procedure was not purely etymological, but involved a reference to tradition; and ridicules the assertion that a European scholar can understand the Veda more correctly than S\u0101ya\u1e47a, or arrive more nearly at the meaning which the Rishis gave to their own hymns.\n\nWith reference to the strictures of Prof. Goldst\u00fccker on the assertion which he attributes to Prof. Roth, that S\u0101ya\u1e47a and the other later commentators give \"only that sense of the Veda which was current in India some centuries ago,\"\nI would remark that I find nothing in the passage quoted by Prof. Goldst\u00fccker, and by myself, from Roth, to show that the latter scholar, although he refuses to be bound by the interpretations of the medi\u00e6val scholiasts, and may regard these interpretations as having been in great part initiated by those scholiasts themselves, is therefore disposed to deny that they may in part have been founded on older materials handed down by former generations. Because a body of interpretation is spoken of as existing at a particular date, it does not follow that no part of it is admitted to have had an earlier origin. In fact, Prof. Roth cannot for a moment be imagined to have ignored the assistance which S\u0101ya\u1e47a had derived from the older work of Y\u0101ska, the Nirukta, a book of which he himself had, only three years before the preface to his Dictionary was written, published an edition. From the concluding pages of that work (which appeared in 1852), I translate the following additional observations on the Indian commentators, which shew that in Roth\u2019s opinion Y\u0101ska, though much more ancient, and otherwise more advantageously situated, than S\u0101ya\u1e47a, stood yet essentially on the same footing with the latter, being rather a learned exegete, working, in all cases of difficulty, by an etymological process, than the depositary of any certain interpretation of the hymns handed down by tradition from the period when they were intelligible to every one who recited them:\n\n\"In regard to the point how much or how little the Indian commentators from Y\u0101ska downwards contribute to the understanding of the Veda, a more correct judgment than that hitherto current will be formed as soon as some of them shall have become completely known. The interpretation of the Veda can lay upon itself no heavier fetters than by believing in the infallibility of these guides, or in the existence of a valuable tradition supposed to have been enjoyed by them. A superficial observation has already shown that their mode of interpretation is simply the reverse of a traditional one, that it is in fact a grammatical and etymological one, which has only so much in common with the traditional method, that it explains each verse, each line, each word by itself, without enquiring how far the results so obtained agree with those derived from other quarters.\n\n\"If any person is disposed to find tradition in the fact that the\ncommentators coincide in having in their minds one tolerably simple scheme of conception, e.g., in regard to the functions of a particular god, or even in regard to the entire contents of the hymns, which they unceasingly force into the texts, he may indeed call that tradition, but he will at the same time admit that this poverty of intuition is nothing which we should very much covet. This scheme embraces the scholastic conceptions, which had become fixed at an early period, but yet not before the date when the Vedic hymns had already become the object of a purely learned study, and when the religious ideas and social circumstances on which they are based had for a long time lost their vitality. In spite of all the irregularities of their imaginative faculty, the Indians have at all times had a longing for arrangement, classification, systematizing, and have through these, in themselves praiseworthy, tendencies very frequently given rise to the greatest confusion. The Vedic literature, too, affords numerous proofs of this.\n\n\"The same remarks apply, in all essential points, to Y\u00e2ska, as to S\u00e2yana, or any other of the later writers. Y\u00e2ska, too, is a learned interpreter, who works with the materials which science had collected before his age; but he has a prodigious advantage in point of time before those compilers of detailed, continuous commentaries, and belongs to a quite different literary period, when Sanskrit still existed in a process of natural growth. And his work gains for us a greater importance from the fact that it is indeed the only one of its kind which has been preserved. Even those commentators who lived five centuries and more before us know of no other comparable to it in rank and antiquity, and are consequently unwearied in their appeals to Y\u00e2ska's authority. The half of the Nirukta might be restored out of S\u00e2yana's Commentary on the Rig-veda.\"\n\nProf. Roth then goes on to give some account of the different schools of interpretation, as well as the names of individual teachers, anterior to Y\u00e2ska (pp. 220 ff.).\n\nI will add here the opinion of one other eminent scholar, Prof. Benfey, on the points at issue between Profs. Roth and Goldst\u00fccker. I quote at second hand from the G\u00f6tt. Gel. Anz. 1858, p. 1608 f., as extracted by Prof. Weber at the end of his reply to Prof. Goldst\u00fccker's P\u00e2nini, in the Indische Studien, v. 174 f.:\n\n\"Every one who has carefully studied the Indian interpretations is aware that absolutely no continuous tradition, extending from the composition of the Vedas to their explanation by Indian scholars,\"\ncan be assumed; that, on the contrary, between the genuine poetic remains of Vedic antiquity and their interpretations a long-continued break in tradition must have intervened, out of which at most the comprehension of some particulars may have been rescued and handed down to later times by means of liturgical usages and words, formul\u00e6, and perhaps, also, poems connected therewith. Besides these remains of tradition, which must be estimated as very scanty, the interpreters of the Veda had, in the main, scarcely any other helps than those which, for the most part, are still at our command, the usage of the classical speech, and the grammatical and etymological-lexicographical investigation of words. At the utmost, they found some said in materials preserved in local dialects; but this advantage is almost entirely outweighed by the comparison which we are able to institute with the Zend, and that which we can make (though here we must of course proceed with caution and prudence) with the other languages cognate to the Sanskrit,\u2014a comparison which has already supplied so many helps to a clearer understanding of the Vedas. But quite irrespectively of all particular aids, the Indian method of interpretation becomes in its whole essence an entirely false one, owing to the prejudice with which it chooses to conceive the ancient circumstances and ideas which have become quite strange to it, from its own religious stand-point, so many centuries more recent; whilst, on the other hand, an advantage for the comprehension of the whole is secured to us by the acquaintance (drawn from analogous relations) with the life, the conceptions, the wants, of ancient peoples and popular songs, which we possess,\u2014an advantage which, even if the Indians owed more details than they actually do owe, to tradition, would not be eclipsed by their interpretation.\"\n\nIt appears, therefore, that the views of Prof. Roth, in regard to the proper principles of Vedic interpretation, are shared by Professors M\u00fcller, Weber, and Benfey; whilst even my learned friend, Prof. Goldst\u00fccker himself, cannot be altogether acquitted (as I shall hereafter show) of a certain heretical tendency to deviate in practice from the interpretations of S\u0101ya\u1e47a,\u2014a tendency which may, perhaps, as his Dictionary advances, become by and by developed into a more pronounced heterodoxy.\n\nI now proceed to inquire, in some detail, whether any considerable traces exist in ancient Indian literature of a tradition of the sense of the Vedic hymns handed continuously down from the earliest period. If any such\ntraces are extant, they must be found primarily in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, or the \u0100ra\u1e47yakas, or in Y\u0101ska. Do these works then contain any interpretations, at once positive and satisfactory, of any considerable portion of the hymns? I begin with the oldest works,\u2014the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as. In a quotation which I have made above from Prof. Max M\u00fcller, he states his opinion that \u201cwe must assume a considerable interval between the composition of the hymns and the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as.\u201d There is no doubt that this is true. The language and the contents of these two classes of works are alike widely different. Referring to the same author\u2019s \u201cHistory of Ancient Indian Literature\u201d for a complete account of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, I will merely quote from it a few sentences, to show how little in his estimation these books are likely to aid us in understanding the hymns:\n\n\u201cThere is throughout the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as,\u201d he writes, p. 432, \u201csuch a complete misunderstanding of the original intention of the Vedic hymns, that we can hardly understand how such an estrangement could have taken place, unless there had been at some time or other a sudden and violent break in the chain of tradition. The authors of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as evidently imagined that those ancient hymns were written simply for the sake of their sacrifices, and whatever interpretation they thought fit to assign to those acts, the same, they supposed, had to be borne out by the hymns. This idea has vitiated the whole system of Indian exegesis. . . . Not only was the true nature of the gods, as conceived by the early poets, completely lost sight of, but new gods were actually created out of words which were never intended to be names of divine beings.\u201d\n\nM\u00fcller goes on, p. 433, to illustrate this by referring to the fact that a god, Ka (Who), was invented out of certain interrogative verses of the Rig-veda in which the worshipper asks to whom he shall address his worship. Thus, for example, the \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, vii. 4, 1, 19, after quoting the first verse of R.V. x. 121, ending with \u201cto what god shall we offer our oblation?\u201d says, \u201cKa (Who) is Praj\u0101pati; to him let us offer our oblation.\u201d M\u00fcller then refers to the taste-\n\n1 Compare \u201cSanskrit Texts,\u201d iv. 18, note.\nless explanation given in a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a of the epithet \"golden-handed\" applied to the Sun in the hymns, that the Sun had lost his hand, and had got instead one of gold.\u00b9 The \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, xiii. 6, 1, 2, understands, very improbably, the Vir\u0101j alluded to in Rig-veda, x. 90, 5 (\"From him (Purusha) was born Vir\u0101j, and from Vir\u0101j, Purusha\"), to be the metre of that name, and declares that Purusha, the sacrifice, was begotten by Purusha on Vir\u0101j. Again, Rig-veda, x. 61, 7, which apparently refers in a figurative manner to some atmospheric phenomenon, is explained in \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, i. 7, 4, 1, as referring to a legend about Praj\u0101pati having literally had sexual intercourse with his own daughter, so as to occasion scandal and indignation among the gods. The same Br\u0101hma\u1e47a contains (xi. 5, 1, 1 ff.) the legend of Pur\u016bravas and Urva\u015bi, in the course of which five verses of the 95th hymn of the 10th book of the R.V. are introduced as part of the conversation which passed between the hero and the nymph, but it does not give any detailed explanation of these verses, and it does not quote at all the verses which make up the rest of the hymn, and which are generally far more difficult to interpret. Again, in the Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a vii. 13-18, where the story of \u015aunah\u1e63epa is told, a large number of verses, composing the 24th to the 30th hymns of the first book of the R.V., and a few from the fourth and fifth books, are referred to as having been uttered by the hero of the legend, but are not even quoted at length, much less explained. (See Dr. Haug's Ait. Br., vol. ii. pp. 466 ff.) There is indeed in Ait. Br. viii. 26 (see Haug, vol. ii. pp. 530 ff.) an interpretation given of three verses of R.V. iv. 50 (vv. 7-9), but this, whatever its value otherwise may be, is but an inconsiderable contribution to the exposition of the hymns. \u015a. P. Br. x. 5, 3, 1, contains a paraphrase of R.V. x. 129, 1, which is not without value. (See my former article on the \"Progress of the Vedic Religion,\" p. 346 f.) Some explanation of R.V. i. 25, 10, also is given in \u015a. P. Br. v. 4, 4, 5. But as far as I have looked into the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as,\n\n\u00b9 See \"Contributions to a Knowledge of Vedic Theogony,\" etc. in this Journal, for 1864, p. 116, note.\nI have seen but very little which can be of much service in throwing light on the original sense of the hymns.\n\nI observe, indeed, that Professor M\u00fcller thus expresses himself (Anc. Sansk. Lit., p. 153) in regard to the use which he thinks may be made of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, etc., for the purpose referred to:\n\n\u201cFor explanations of old Vedic words, for etymologies and synonymous expressions, the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as contain very rich materials. . . . Whole verses and hymns are shortly explained there; and the \u0100ranyakas and Upanishads, if included, would furnish richer sources for Vedic etymologies than even the Nirukta itself. The beginning of the Aitareya \u0100ranyaka is in fact a commentary on the beginning of the Rig-veda; and if all the passages of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as were collected where one word is explained by another with which it is joined merely by the particle vai,1 they would even now give a rich harvest for a new Nirukta.\u201d\n\nThis passage, however, must be taken in connection with those which have been quoted above from the same writer. I am unable to refer to the Aitareya \u0100ranyaka to which he alludes. But judging from the views which he has expressed elsewhere, I conclude that he does not expect, as the result of the researches which he recommends (even if pushed to the utmost extent) into all the existing remains of Indian literature exterior to the hymns themselves, any very extensive or material assistance towards the restoration of the original sense of the latter. But whatever might be the issue of the course of investigation thus suggested, it is at least presupposed in Prof. M\u00fcller\u2019s recommendation that this process of carefully searching the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and \u0100ranyakas for interpretations of obsolete Vedic words and phrases has not yet been pursued to a sufficient extent by any of the Indian etymologists or commentators. But if this be true\u2014if any considerable amount of important materials suitable to their purpose has been neglected by Y\u0101ska or S\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2014it is clear that we cannot look to either of those writers as our final or sufficient authority.\n\n1 [As, for instance, in the cases vi\u1e63o vai pasty\u0101\u1e25 (\u015a. P. Br. v. 4, 4, 5) Pr\u0101j\u00f1\u0101patir vai \u1e2a\u0101\u1e45, \u015a. P. Br. vii. 4, 1, 19.\u2014J.M].\nI now come to the Nigha\u1e47\u1e6dus, and the Nirukta of Y\u0101ska. The Nigha\u1e47\u1e6dus form a vocabulary of terms, many of which are obsolete. The first three sections are almost entirely made up of lists of so-called synonymes, varying in number from two to one hundred and twenty-two, of nouns or verbs of well-known signification, such as prthivi, \"earth,\" hiranya, \"gold,\" antariksha, \"atmosphere,\" jval, \"to burn,\" gam, \"to go.\" The remaining two sections consist of mere lists of words of different significations, which are left unexplained. There does not seem to be any reason to doubt that in the first three sections of this work the general sense of many obsolete words has been preserved by tradition; though as the terms declared to be synonymous are often very numerous, it is clear from the nature of the case, as Prof. Roth observes (see above), that the specific sense, and particular shade of meaning, represented by each, must be often left in the dark. And an examination of the lists puts this beyond a doubt. Thus under the synonymes of r\u0101ch, \"speech,\" we find such words as \u015bloka, nivid, \u1e5bk, g\u0101th\u0101, anushtup, words denoting different kinds of verses or compositions, which can never have been employed as simple equivalents of speech in the abstract. The value of these lists therefore for the purpose of defining the precise signification of words is very limited. And even if the first three sections were of more value than they are in this respect, they are far from embracing the whole of the difficult words in the Veda. The fourth section contains two hundred and seventy-eight words which are not explained at all, though there are, no doubt, a good many among them which do not require any explanation, as their sense is notorious.\n\nThe Nirukta of Y\u0101ska is a sort of commentary on the Nigha\u1e47\u1e6dus. It begins with these words: \"A record has been composed, which we have to explain. It is called the Nigha\u1e47\u1e6dus.\" The introduction to the work (i. 1\u2014ii. 4) contains the outlines of a grammatical system, and an ex-\n\n---\n\n1 Prof. Roth considers this vocabulary to be older than Y\u0101ska. (Introduction to Nirukta, p. xii. f.). M\u00fcller, too, (Anc. Ind. Lit. 164), says, \"probably these lists existed in his family long before his time.\"\nplanation of the advantages, objects, principles and methods of exegesis. This is followed (ii. 5\u2014iii. 22) by remarks suggested by the lists of explained synonyms composing the first three sections of the Nigha\u1e47\u1e6dus. In the succeeding chapters (iv.\u2014vi.) of the Nirukta, the unexplained terms in the fourth section of the Nigha\u1e47\u1e6dus are interpreted; whilst in the last six books the list of words, chiefly names of deities, contained in the fifth section of the Nigha\u1e47\u1e6dus, is elucidated. The thirteenth and fourteenth chapters, styled Nirukta-pari\u015bishta, appear to be the work of a later writer.\n\nThe Nirukta makes frequent reference to the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, adduces various legends, such as those about Dev\u0101pi (xi. 10) and Vi\u1e63\u1e47umitra (ii. 24), and also alludes to various schools of Vedic interpretation which existed anterior to the time of its author, such as the Nairuktas or etymologists, the Aitih\u0101sikas or legendary writers, and the Y\u0101jnikas or ritualists. In the course of his work, Y\u0101ska supplies some specimens of the mode of explaining the hymns adopted by these different classes of expositors, from which it would appear that each school interpreted from its own special point of view, and according to its own literary, moral, or professional tendencies and prepossessions. Thus we are told (Nirukta, xi. 29 and 31) that the Nairuktas understood Anumati, R\u0101k\u0101, Siniv\u0101li, and Kuh\u016b to be goddesses, while the Y\u0101jnikas took them for the new and full moons. On one point the greatest diversity of opinion prevailed. The gods called \u0100\u015bvins were a great enigma. The Nirukta (xii. 1) gives the following answers to the question who they were: \u201c\u2018Heaven and Earth,\u2019 say some; \u2018Day and Night,\u2019 say others; \u2018the Sun and Moon,\u2019 say others; \u2018two kings, performers of the holy acts,\u2019 say the Aitih\u0101sikas.\u201d\n\nIn his explanation of R.V. i. 164, 32, Y\u0101ska\n\n---\n\n1 See all this more fully stated in Roth's Illustrations of the Nirukta, p. 3.\n2 See Roth's Illustrations of the Nirukta, pp. 220 ff.\n3 S\u0101yana also mentions some of these different schools of interpreters in different parts of his commentary. Thus on R.V. i. 64, 8, he says: \"Pr\u0101k\u1e5btya\u1e25, the Maruts' instruments of conveyance, are does marked with white spots according to the Aitih\u0101sikas, and a line of variously coloured clouds according to the Nairuktas.\" Again, he tells us that writers of the former class understood R.V. i. 174, 2, of the cities belonging to V\u1e5btra's Asuras, whilst those of the latter clas...\n(ii. 8) refers to the Parivr\u0101jakas (ascetic mendicants) as attributing one sense to the close of that verse, while the Nairuktas assigned a different one.\\(^1\\) It is thus clear that from the earliest period there were diversities of opinion in regard to the sense of the hymns. As we come down to later times, when speculation had been further developed, we find some new varieties of interpretation. Thus in the Nirukta-pari\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6da, i. 9, the \"four defined grades or stages of speech\" referred to in R.V. i. 164, 45, are said to be diversely explained, \"by the Rishis as meaning the four mystic words *om*, *bh\u016b\u1e25*, *bhuvah*, *svar*; by the grammarians as denoting nouns, verbs, prepositions, and particles; by the ritualists as referring to the hymns, the liturgical precepts, the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and the ordinary language; by the etymologists as designating the Rik, the Yajush, the S\u0101man texts, and the current language; whilst by others they are thought to signify the languages of serpents, birds, reptiles, and the vernacular; and the spiritualists (*\u0101tmapravaddha*) understand them of the modes of speech in beasts, musical instruments (?), wild animals, and soul.\"\n\nY\u0101ska gives also the names of no less than seventeen interpreters who had preceded him,\\(^2\\) and whose explanations of the Veda are often conflicting. Thus we are informed (Nir. iii. 8) that some understood the \"five peoples\" (*panchajandha*) mentioned in R.V. x. 53, 4, to be the Gandharvas, Pitris, gods, Asuras, and Rakshases; whilst Aupamanyana took them for the four castes and the Nish\u0101das.\\(^3\\) From Nir. iv. 3, it appears that while Y\u0101ska himself understood the word *\u015bit\u0101ma* which occurs\n\nunderstood it of the clouds. In like manner, on viii. 66, 10, he gives us two separate interpretations of that verse, the first that of the Nairuktas, who expounded it of natural phenomena, of showers brought by the sun (represented by Vi\u1e63\u1e47u), and the second that of the \u0100itih\u0101sikas, who explained it mythologically in conformity with a story drawn from the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a of the Charukas.\n\n\\(^1\\) The ascetics, influenced, perhaps, by their own feelings of estrangement from family life, gave to the words in question the meaning \"The father of many children suffers distress.\" The Etymologists understood the same clause of the fructifying effects of rain.\n\n\\(^2\\) Roth, Illustrations, pp. 221 f.\n\n\\(^3\\) In Nir. iii. 15, several different derivations of the word *vidhav\u0101*, \"widow,\" are given. It is said to be either = *vidh\u0101trk\u0101*, \"without a supporter;\" or, according to Charmas\u012br\u1e47a (one of Y\u0101ska's predecessors), to come from *vidhavana* or *vidh\u0101vana*; or to be derived from *vi* + *dh\u0101ra*, \"without a man.\"\n\nVOL. II.\u2014[NEW SERIES.]\nin the V\u00e2jasaneyi Sanhita, xxi. 43, of the shoulder of the sacrificial victim, S\u00e2kap\u00fbni took it for the female organ, Tai-tiki for the liver, and G\u00e2lava for the fat. Again, Nir. vi. 13, tells us that Aur\u00f1abh\u00e2va understood the word N\u00e2satyau (an epithet of the A\u015bvins) to mean \u201ctrue, not false\u201d (satyau, na asatyau; \u00c2gr\u00e2yana took it to mean \u201cleaders of truth\u201d satyasya pranet\u00e2rau); whilst Y\u00e2ska himself suggests that it may signify \u201cnose-born\u201d n\u00e2sik\u00e2-prabhavau). From Nir. vii. 23, it appears that whilst the early ritualists held the deity lauded in R.V. i. 59, 6, to be the Sun, S\u00e2kap\u00fbni on the contrary held that it was Agni Vaisv\u00e2nara. Further, in Nir. viii. 2, we are informed that Kraush\u1e6duki held Dravi\u1e47odas to mean Indra, but S\u00e2kap\u00fbni considered the term to denote Agni. K\u00e2tthakya was of opinion that the word idhma signified merely the wood employed in sacrifice, while S\u00e2kap\u00fbni thought it stood for Agni (Nir. viii. 4, 5). So, again, K\u00e2tthakya understood Nar\u00e2\u015fansa to designate \u201csacrifice,\u201d but S\u00e2kap\u00fbni took it for a name of Agni (ibid. 6); K\u00e2tthakya explained the \u201cdivine doors\u201d (R.V. x. 110, 5), of the house-doors at sacrifice, but S\u00e2kap\u00fbni took them to stand for Agni (ibid. 10); the former interpreter held Vanaspati to be the sacrificial post, but S\u00e2kap\u00fbni asserted that it was a name of Agni (ibid. 17). In like manner, Y\u00e2ska\u2019s predecessors were not agreed as to what was meant by Vishnu\u2019s three steps mentioned in R.V. i. 22, 17, S\u00e2kap\u00fbni maintaining that they were planted on the earth, the atmosphere, and the sky respectively; and Aur\u00f1abh\u00e2va that it was the hill over which the sun rises, the meridian, and the hill where he sets, that were the localities referred to. Finally, the etymologists declared that the word S\u00e2dhyas in R.V. x. 90, 16, denoted the gods residing in the sky, whilst according to a legend (\u00e2khy\u00e2na) it represented a former age of the gods (p\u00fbrvam deva-yugam: comp. R.V. x. 72, 2, 3).\n\nThere was one of Y\u00e2ska\u2019s predecessors who had actually the audacity to assert that the science of Vedic exposition was useless, as the Vedic hymns and formulae were obscure, unmeaning, or mutually contradictory. As instances of obscurity, he cites the texts in which the words amyak (R.V.\ni. 169, 3), y\u0101d\u1e5b\u1e63min (R.V. v. 44, 8), j\u0101ray\u0101yi (R.V. vi. 12, 4), and k\u0101nuk\u0101 (R.V. viii. 66, 4), occur. In regard to this charge of obscurity, Y\u0101ska replies that it is not the fault of the post that the blind man does not see it; it is the man's fault.\\(^1\\) It would appear from the objections of this rationalist, that in his day many learned men had great difficulties in regard to the sense of different passages of the hymns. It is true indeed that Durg\u0101ch\u0101rya, the commentator on the Nirukta, seems to consider Kautsa a mere man of straw, into whose mouth these objections are dramatically put for the sake of their being refuted;\\(^2\\) but I do not see why Kautsa should be regarded as a fictitious personage any more than any of the other predecessors of Y\u0101ska who are named in the Nirukta. And even if he were admitted to be so, it may be assumed as certain that Y\u0101ska, an orthodox believer, would never have alluded to sceptical doubts of this description unless they had been previously started by some of his predecessors, and had been commonly current in his time. We shall see further on how he succeeds in the attempt he makes to explain some of the texts which Kautsa charges with obscurity.\n\nThe question how far Y\u0101ska can be regarded as the depository of a real and satisfactory Vedic tradition has been thus already, in part, answered, and in an unfavourable sense, by the account I have given of the differences of opinion existing among his predecessors. I now proceed to enquire further how far his own language and method of interpretation show him to have been walking in the clear light of day, or groping in the dark, and merely guessing at the sense of the hymns.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that, with all the appliances which it appears he had at his command in the works of his predecessors, which he quotes, and probably others besides, Y\u0101ska should not have been able to determine the sense of many words which later scholars like S\u0101ya\u1e47a had no means of dis-\n\n\\(^1\\) See Nirukta, i. 15 f.; Roth's Illustrations, pp. 11 f.; and \"Sanskrit Texts,\" ii. 181 ff.\n\n\\(^2\\) \"Sanskrit Texts,\" ii. 184.\ncovering. According to Prof. Max M\u00fcller, Y\u0101ska lived in the fourth century before our era. Prof. Goldst\u00fccker holds that he was anterior to P\u0101\u1e47ini, whose date he considers to be involved in impenetrable obscurity, and yet, he thinks, must have been anterior to that of Buddha, whose death again he speaks of as the remotest date of Hindu antiquity which can be called a real date, agreeing apparently with Lassen in placing it in 543 B.C., whilst M\u00fcller refers it to 477 B.C. Y\u0101ska was thus some two thousand years older than S\u0101ya\u1e47a. We may therefore often assume, that when he affirms positively that a word unknown to later Sanskrit has such and such a meaning, even though he attaches to it an etymology, and when the sense suits the passage, he had grounds for his assertion. Thus, when he says (iv. 15) that tugran means a \"ford,\" or (v. 22) svaghnin, a \"gambler,\" or (vi. 26) that bekandta signifies a \"usurer,\" there is no reason to dispute his affirmation. But whenever he seems to draw the meaning from the etymology, and his interpretation does not yield a good sense, we must doubt whether his opinion rested on any trustworthy tradition. And again, when he gives two or more alternative or optional explanations of the same word, all apparently founded on mere etymology, we are justified in supposing that he had no earlier authority for his guide, and that his renderings are simply conjectural. Many instances, I believe, can be given where the phenomenon last described occurs; and I shall proceed to bring forward some specimens. There are also cases in which Y\u0101ska is positive as to the meaning he assigns, but in which the sense of the passage, or a collation of other texts, justifies us in departing from his rendering. In all these passages I shall at the same time give the interpretation proposed by S\u0101ya\u1e47a, if it be within my reach. And as it will sometimes be found that S\u0101ya\u1e47a departs from Y\u0101ska, we shall, in such instances, either have to conclude that the older interpreter is wrong\u2014in which event ancient tradition must in that particular instance\n\n---\n\n1 \"Last Results of Sanskrit Researches\" in \"Bunsen's Christianity and Mankind,\" vol. iii. p. 137.\n2 P\u0101\u1e47ini, pp. 225, 227.\n3 Ibid, pp. 231, 233.\nbe of no value\u2014or that S\u0101ya\u1e47a does not there follow tradition at all. In such cases either the value of the supposed tradition, or its faithful reproduction by the later commentator, will be disproved.\n\nThe following are specimens of these different cases, together with some instances of words which do not occur in the Nirukta, but in which S\u0101ya\u1e47a gives a variety of inconsistent explanations:\n\n1. Ath\u0101ryu is an epithet of Agni. Y\u0101ska (v. 10) renders it by atanavantam, \u201cgoing\u201d or \u201cmoving.\u201d S\u0101ya\u1e47a, in R.V. vii. 1, 1, explains it by \u0101gamya\u1e41 atanavantam ed, i.e., either \u201cto be gone to, approached,\u201d or \u201cgoing,\u201d \u201cmoving.\u201d It thus appears that he does not implicitly follow Y\u0101ska, and was not sure of the sense. Prof. Goldst\u00fccker, s.v., renders it \u201cmoving constantly.\u201d Prof. Roth, s.v., thinks it means \u201chaving sharp points like a lance.\u201d\n\n2. An\u0101nuda is an adjective not found in the Nirukta, but in different passages of the R.V. On i. 53, 8, S\u0101ya\u1e47a explains it as anuchara-rahitah, \u201cwithout followers;\u201d on ii. 21, 4, and ii. 23, 11, as \u201cone after whom no other gives,\u201d i.e., \u201cunequalled in giving.\u201d On this Prof. Goldst\u00fccker remarks: \u201cBoth meanings of the word, as given according to the Comm., seem doubtful;\u201d but he proposes no other. Roth, s.v., translates it by \u201cunyielding.\u201d\n\n(1) Anushvadham, (2) anu svadh\u0101m, (3) svadh\u0101m anu, (4) svadhay\u0101, (5) svadh\u0101bhih, (6) svadh\u0101cat. The first of these words occurs in various texts of the R.V., one of which, iii. 47, 1, is quoted in Nir. iv. 8, where the word is explained by anv annam, \u201cafter food.\u201d Prof. Goldst\u00fccker, s.v., explains it thus: 1, \u201cin consequence of (partaking of) food, through food, viz., soma, etc.; 2, food for food, to every food (as clarified butter); 3, after every oblation.\u201d The sixth word, svadh\u0101cat, occurs in two places in the Nirukta, viz., in x. 6 (where R.V. vii. 46, 1, is quoted), when it is an epithet, in the dative, of Rudra; and in xii. 17 (where R.V. vi. 58, 1, is quoted), when it is an epithet, in the vocative, of P\u016bshan. In both places the\n\n1 Prof. Wilson has misunderstood the latter of the two words when he translates it, \u201cnot spreading or dispersing.\u201d See his note in loco.\nword is rendered by annavat, \"having food.\" Anushvadham is found in R.V. i. 81, 4; ii. 3, 11; iii. 47, 1. In the first of these texts S\u0101yana explains it to mean \"during the drinking of food in the shape of soma;\" in the second by \"at every oblation\" (prati havih); and in the third by \"followed by,\" or \"following,\" the oblations (savantya-purod\u0101\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101di-r\u016bpenannen\u0101nugatam... svadh\u0101m anugamya varttam\u0101nam). The words anu svadh\u0101m are found separately in R.V. i. 33, 11; viii. 77, 5; and in the reverse order svadh\u0101m anu in i. 6, 4, and viii. 20, 7.\n\nIn the first of these texts S\u0101yana renders the words by \"the waters flowed with reference to Indra's food in the shape of rice,\" etc. (annam v\u1e5bthy-adi-r\u016bpam anulak\u1e63ya); in the second (viii. 77, 5), by \"after our food or water;\" in the third (i. 6, 4), by \"with reference to the food or water which was about to be produced;\" and in the fourth (viii. 20, 7), by, \"with reference to food having the character of an oblation.\"\n\nSvadhaya is found in R.V. i. 64, 4, applied to the Maruts, where it is correctly rendered by S\u0101yana svaktyena balena, \"by their own strength.\" In iv. 13, 5, too, kay\u0101 svadhaya is explained as = kena balena, \"by what strength?\" It also occurs in vii. 78, 4; ix. 71, 8; x. 27, 19; x. 88, 1; x. 129, 2.\n\nIn the first of these passages the word is rendered by annena, \"by food.\" Surely there can be little doubt that here it means \"by its own power,\" \"spontaneously.\" To say, \"she (Ushas) ascended her car yoked by food,\" which her well-yoked horses\n\n---\n\n1 It also occurs in ix. 72, 5; but I have no access to S\u0101yana's Comm. on that passage.\n2 See also R.V. i. 165, 5; vii. 56, 13.\n3 S\u0101yana here gives the following derivation of svadh\u0101, viz.: svam lokam dadh\u0101ti push\u1e47\u0101ti iti svadh\u0101. This word has three senses assigned to it in the Nighantu, viz., \"water\" (i. 12), \"food\" (ii. 7), and \"heaven and earth\" in the dual (iii. 30).\n4 The same general sense is assigned in i. 154, 4; v. 34, 1; vii. 47, 3. See also S\u0101yana on i. 164, 38.\n5 I am not aware that in any passage the chariots or horses of the gods are said to be yoked by food, as denoted by any word which certainly bears that sense. The horses of Indra are, indeed, represented as being yoked by prayer (brahma-yuj) in R.V. i. 177, 2; iii. 35, 4; viii. 1, 24; viii. 2, 27; viii. 2, 17; and as being yoked by a hymn (v\u0101co-yuj) in viii. 45, 39; but in these cases, generally, at least, the god is supposed to yoke his car in consequence of this invitation to come and partake of the oblation, or libation, and not after partaking of it. It is true that the word brahm\u0101 (neuter) has sometimes the sense of \"food\" or \"oblation\" ascribed to it, and that in two of the above texts, viii. 1, 24, and viii. 2, 27, one of the optional senses assigned by S\u0101yana to brahma-yuj is, \"yoked by our oblation,\" two other senses, \"yoked by the lord, Indra,\" and \"yoked by our\nbring hither,\" makes but an indifferent sense, whilst it would yield an appropriate poetical meaning to say that she ascended her car yoked \"by its own inherent power.\" Compare R.V. iv. 26, 4, where the phrase achakray\u0101 svadh\u0101ya is rendered by S\u0101yana a \"wheel-less car,\" the word svadh\u0101 having here, he says, the sense of chariot (atra svadh\u0101-sabdo ratha-v\u0101ch\u0101); and for proof he refers to R.V. x. 27, 19, where we have the words achakray\u0101 svadh\u0101ya varttam\u0101nam, etc., \"I beheld the troop borne from afar, moving by a wheel-less inherent power,\" which is no doubt the proper rendering in iv. 26, 4, also. It is clear that svadh\u0101 could not have the sense of chariot in vii. 78, 4, above cited, as it would be absurd to speak of the car (ratha) of Ushas being yoked by a car (svadh\u0101). Having no access to S\u0101yana's comment on x. 27, 19, I am not aware how he translates it; but he probably adheres to the rendering given on iv. 26, 4, as it would make nonsense to say, \"moving by wheel-less food.\" As regards R.V. x. 129, 2, 5, I gather from Mr. Colebrooke's translation (Misc. Essays, i. 34), than even S\u0101yana abandons the sense of food as appropriate in that hymn, since svadh\u0101 is there rendered by \"her who is sustained within him.\" It seems, however, better to render it in verse 2 by \"through its inherent power,\" and in v. 5, by \"a self-supporting principle.\" The sense, \"by their own power\" seems appropriate in x. 88, 1, though here too it is rendered by \"food,\" Nir. vii. 25. Stadhabhi\u1e25 (loc. pl.) is explained in i. 95, 4, and i. 164, 30, by \"sacrificial food;\" in v. 60, 4, by \"waters;\" in vii. 104, 9, by \"forces;\" and in viii. 10, 4, by \"praises which are the cause of strength.\" I come lastly to svadh\u0101vat, which I find in R.V. v. 3, 2; vi. 58, 1; vii. 20, 1; vii. 37, 2; vii. 46, 1; vii. 86, 5, and elsewhere. In vi. 58, 1, and vii. 46, 1, as we have already seen, the word is rendered by Y\u0101ska, \"having food;\" and in\n\nhymn,\" being proposed in the former case, and one alternative sense, \"yoked by our hymn,\" being proposed in the latter. In i. 177, 2; iii. 35, 4; and viii. 17, 2, however, \"yoked by our hymn\" (mantra) is the only rendering given. Vacho-yuj in viii. 45, 39, is explained, \"yoked by our hymn.\"\n\nThis and some other instances show that S\u0101yana did occasionally resort to parallel passages for the elucidation of the text under his consideration, but he did not carry the practice far enough.\n\nCompare achakrebhi\u1e25 in R.V. v. 42, 10, and nichakray\u0101 in viii. 7, 29.\nthese passages (as well as in vii. 31, 7; vii. 88, 5), he is followed by S\u0101yana, who, again, in i. 95, 4; v. 3, 2, translates it by \u201chaving sacrificial food.\u201d In vi. 21, 3; vii. 20, 1; vii. 37, 2; and vii. 86, 4, however, S\u0101yana departs from Y\u0101ska, and from his own practice elsewhere, in rendering svadh\u0101vat by balavat or tejasvin, \u201cstrong,\u201d or \u201cvigorous.\u201d Prof. Roth has treated of anushvadham, etc., in his Illustrations of the Nirukta, pp. 40 f.; and in his Lexicon he translates the word in question by \u201cwillingly,\u201d \u201cspontaneously,\u201d \u201cgladly.\u201d In his new translation of the R.V., in the \u201cOrient und Occident,\u201d Prof. Benfey renders svadh\u0101m anu, anu svadh\u0101m, and anushvadham, in i. 6, 4; i. 33, 11; and i. 81, 4, in a similar manner. This interpretation, in fact, will probably be found to suit nearly all, if not the whole, of the texts in which the phrase is found.\n\nApr\u0101yu is explained in Nir. iv. 19, where R.V. i. 89, 1, is quoted, as meaning in that passage (where it is an epithet of the gods) apram\u0101dyantah, \u201cnot careless.\u201d S\u0101yana, in his comment on the same text, declares it to be equivalent to apragachhanta\u1e25 svaktyam rak\u1e63itavyam aparityajyantah, \u201cnot departing, not forsaking him whom they have to protect.\u201d (Mah\u012bdhara, the commentator on the V\u0101j. S. (where this text is repeated, xxv. 14), explains the word by an\u0101las\u0101\u1e25, \u201cnot sluggish.\u201d) The word occurs again in R.V. viii. 24, 18, as an epithet of sacrifices, where S\u0101yana interprets it to mean either sacrifices which are conducted by men who are \u201cnot careless\u201d (apram\u0101dyat), or by \u201ccareful men who perform the rite remaining together, and do not go elsewhere after they have begun it.\u201d In the first passage, at least, he departs from S\u0101yana. Prof. Goldst\u00fccker, s.v., renders the word \u201cattentive,\u201d \u201cassiduous,\u201d adding, \u201caccording to Y\u0101ska . . . ; but S\u0101yana gives to this word in one verse the meaning, \u2018not going forth, not leaving\u2019 . . . ; while in another he admits also the former meaning, which seems more congenial to the context.\u201d\n\nAmbhrina is given in Nigh. iii. 3, as one of the synonyms of mahat, \u201cgreat.\u201d It occurs in R.V. i. 133, 5, as an epithet of pi\u015b\u0101chi, \u201ca goblin,\u201d and is interpreted by S\u0101yana as mean-\ning either \"shrieking very terribly\" or \"very huge.\" It is clear, therefore, that S\u0101yana did not know by any certain tradition what the sense of the word was.\n\nAmyak.\u2014This word is found in one of the passages which Kautsa (see above) charges with obscurity, R.V. i. 169, 3; amyak s\u00e1 te Indra r\u1e63\u1e6dir asme; and I therefore think it as well to give some account of it, although it does not afford any very strong evidence in favour of any of the propositions I have undertaken to establish. Y\u0101ska, Nir. vi. 15, explains the term by am\u0101kteti v\u0101 abhyakteti v\u0101, meaning apparently either \"arrived near,\" or \"arrived towards.\" The fact of his giving an alternative etymology shows that he did not know for certain what the real derivation was, though his mind may have been made up as to the sense. Prof. Roth (Illustrations of Nir. p. 81) considers amyak to be the third per. aor. of myaksh, which, from a comparison of other passages, he believes to have the sense of \"gleaming.\" The words would thus mean: \"Thy bolt gleamed upon us, o Indra.\" S\u0101yana, without offering any etymology, translates the clause thus: \"Thy thunderbolt comes (pr\u0101pnoti) near the clouds for us, for rain to us.\" As both Y\u0101ska (in the passage above cited) and S\u0101yana in his introduction to the R.V. (p. 5 of M\u00fcller's edition) had referred to and ridiculed the objection taken against the intelligibility of this verse, they were bound in honour to make it yield some sense or other; though from the obscurity of which it was cited as an instance\u2014perhaps a proverbial instance\u2014even so far back as the time of the former, it seems difficult to suppose that they had any certain tradition to go upon as to its meaning. Prof. Goldst\u00fccker translates the word amyak (see s.v.) \"towards, near;\" and adds: \"This is apparently the meaning of the word in the following Rig-veda verse, where it seems to be used with the ellipsis of 'come.'\" He then, after quoting the verse before us, goes on: \"Yaska, who, in a discussion in his introduction, denies that this word can be called obscure, renders it in this verse am\u0101kteti v\u0101bhyakteti v\u0101, 'come here,' or 'come towards;' and S\u0101yana explains it by pr\u0101pnoti, without, however, giving its etymology. This formation of the word corresponds with that of other com-\npounds ending in ach.\" Prof. Goldst\u00fccker holds that it would be \"against all grammatical analogy\" to take amyak for an aorist, as Roth proposes. There is no proof, however, that either Y\u0101ska or S\u0101ya\u1e47a concurred with Prof. Goldst\u00fccker in holding the word for a particle in ach.\n\nAlatrna occurs in two passages of the Rig-veda. One of these, iii. 30, 10, is quoted in Nir. vi. 2, where it is explained as = alam \u0101tardanah, \"greatly-splitting, or split.\" If this explanatory phrase be understood in the passive sense, it will coincide with S\u0101ya\u1e47a's interpretation, \"that which, from being full of water, is exceedingly broken.\" In i. 166, 7, the word is an epithet of the Maruts, and is explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a as susceptible of three different senses, viz., as standing either\u20141st, for an\u0101tr\u1e47\u0101sa\u1e25 = \u0101tardana-rahit\u0101\u1e25, \"free from splitting;\" or, 2nd, as alam \u0101tardandh \u015batr\u016bn\u0101m, \"great cleavers of their enemies;\" or, 3rd, as alam d\u0101t\u0101ra\u1e25 phal\u0101n\u0101m, \"great bestowers of rewards.\" Who will say that S\u0101ya\u1e47a is here either a confident, or a satisfactory, guide?\n\nAskrdhoyu is explained by Y\u0101ska (in Nir. vi. 3, where he quotes R.V. vi. 22, 3) as = akrdhv-\u0101yuh, \"not short-lived;\" krdhu, being = hrasva, \"short.\" S\u0101ya\u1e47a renders it in two passages (vi. 22, 3; vi. 67, 11) by avichhinna, \"not cut off,\" which would coincide with Y\u0101ska's interpretation; but on vii. 53, 3, he takes it for ahrasvam analpam, \"not short,\" \"not little,\" which seems to differ somewhat from the former sense, inasmuch as it refers not to duration but to quantity.\n\nAsridh does not occur in the Nirukta. It is variously interpreted by S\u0101ya\u1e47a either as \"free from decay,\" or \"desiccation\" (i. 3, 9; i. 13, 9), or as \"free from desiccation, always remaining in the same state (the Maruts,\" i. 89, 3), or as \"innocuous\" (iv. 32, 24; iv. 45, 4; v. 46, 4).\n\nAhimanyu does not occur in the Nirukta. It is applied to the Maruts in R.V. i. 64, 8, where S\u0101ya\u1e47a offers a choice of interpretations, making it either = \u0101hanana-\u015bila-manyu-yukt\u0101\u1e25, \"filled with wrath disposed to smite,\" or = ahna-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101\u1e25, \"of eminent wisdom.\" He was, therefore, only guessing at the sense.\n\nAhim\u0101ya is not found in the Nirukta. It is understood by\nS\u0101ya\u1e47a on i. 190, 4, as an epithet of V\u1e5bttra and his class, and translated as either\u2014\u201cthose whose enchantments come and destroy,\u201d or \u201cthose whose enchantments come in the atmosphere.\u201d On vi. 20, 7, he understands it as = \u201cthose who have destructive enchantments;\u201d and on vi. 52, 15, as= \u201cthose who have destructive wisdom.\u201d I am not aware how he renders it in x. 63, 4. Another epithet of the gods, ehim\u0101ya, which Roth thinks may be a corruption of ahim\u0101ya, occurs in R.V. i. 3, 9, where S\u0101ya\u1e47a assigns two possible senses\u20141st, \u201chaving all-pervading wisdom;\u201d and, 2nd, that of a designation of the deities, derived from their having said to Agni when he had entered into the waters, chi m\u0101 y\u0101sth, \u201ccome, do not go.\u201d\n\n\u0100\u015bu\u1e63ukshani, which occurs R.V. ii. 1, 1, and V\u0101j. S. xi. 27, as an epithet of Agni, is explained in Nir. vi. 1 as meaning either \u201cone who quickly slays, or gives, by his flame\u201d (\u0101\u015bu \u015buch\u0101 k\u1e63anoti iti v\u0101 sanoti iti v\u0101), or \u201cdesiring to consume.\u201d S\u0101ya\u1e47a translates the word \u201cflaming on all sides,\u201d or \u201cone who quickly gives pain to his enemies by consuming,\u201d etc. Mahidhara, on V\u0101j. S. xi. 27, translates \u0101\u015bu\u1e63ukshani as either = \u201cquickly drying the wet ground,\u201d or as= \u201cquickly destroying the darkness with his flame, or giving, distributing, by his flame.\u201d Roth (Illustrations of Nirukta, p. 72) compares su\u1e63ukrani in R.V. viii. 23, 5, where S\u0101ya\u1e47a renders \u201cglowing.\u201d\n\n\u0100\u015ba occurs frequently in the Rig-veda, and is diversely explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a. In his comments on ii. 1, 14; iv. 5, 10; vi. 3, 4; vi. 32, 1, he renders it by \u0101syena, \u201cwith the mouth;\u201d on v. 17, 2, by \u0101syena v\u0101ch\u0101, \u201cwith the mouth, by speech;\u201d on v. 17, 5; v. 23, 1, by \u0101syena stotrena, \u201cwith the mouth, with a hymn;\u201d on i. 76, 4; vi. 16, 9, by \u0101syena \u0101sya-sth\u0101ntyay\u0101 (or \u0101sya-bh\u016btay\u0101) jv\u0101lay\u0101, \u201cwith the mouth, with the flame in the mouth;\u201d on vii. 16, 9, as an epithet of jihvay\u0101, \u201cthe tongue,\u201d by \u0101sya-sth\u0101ntyay\u0101, \u201csituated in the mouth;\u201d on i. 129, 5, by \u201cnear, in the place of sacrifice;\u201d and on i. 168, 2, by \u201cnear.\u201d Similarly, he varies in the sense of \u0101saya, making it stand in one place (i. 20, 1) for \u201cwith the mouth,\u201d and in another (i. 127, 8) for \u201cnear.\u201d\nIn the Nigha\u1e47\u1e6dus, ii. 16, the word \u0101\u015bat is found as one of the synonyms of \"near.\"\n\n\u012ashmin is variously interpreted by S\u0101yana in different places, viz., on i. 87, 6, and vii. 56, 11, as \"going, moving;\" on v. 52, 16; v. 87, 5, as \"going,\" or \"possessing food.\" Y\u0101ska gives the three derivations of \u012bsh\u0101ninah, esh\u0101ninah, and arsh\u0101ninah (Nir. iv. 16).\n\n\u012avat.\u2014This word occurs in R.V. iv. 4, 6; iv. 15, 5; iv. 43, 3; v. 49, 5; vi. 73, 2; vii. 23, 1; vii. 56, 18; viii. 46, 21. In all these passages, without exception, S\u0101yana renders it either simply by \"going,\" \"moving,\" or by some modification of that sense, as \"coming,\" \"approaching,\" \"coming with prosperity,\" \"occupied,\" \"moving creatures.\" And yet there seems no reason to doubt that the word signifies \"so much,\" \"so great,\" as it is explained by Roth, s.v., as being an old Vedic form for iyat, just as ktvat is for kiyat, as is (in the latter case) recognised both by Y\u0101ska (Nir. vi. 3) and by S\u0101yana on R.V. iii. 30, 17, the only passage where it occurs. From this it appears that just as in ordinary Sanskrit t\u0101drk and k\u0101drk are formed in the same way as et\u0101drk, t\u0101drk, y\u0101drk, so, too, in ancient times the series of et\u0101vat, t\u0101vat, y\u0101vat, was completed by \u012bvat and ktvat, though at a subsequent period the two latter forms became obsolete, whilst iyat and kiyat, which are also found in the R.V., were regarded as alone correct. Their sense of \"so much,\" \"so great,\" etc. etc., appears, as far as I can judge, to suit all the passages of the R.V. where the word \u012bvat occurs.\n\nUrug\u0101ya (generally an epithet of Vishnu) is interpreted by Y\u0101ska (Nir. ii. 7) in his comment on R.V. i. 154, 6, as = mah\u0101gati, \"making large strides.\" S\u0101yana, however, wavers in his explanation, making it either \"hymned by many\" (on i. 154, 3; ii. 1, 3); \"wide-going,\" or \"much-praised\" (on iii. 6, 4); \"hymned by many,\" or \"of great renown\" (on iv. 3, 7); \"great goers\" (of the A\u015bvins, iv. 14, 1); \"celebrated by many\" (on vii. 100, 1); \"to be hymned by many,\" or \"moving in many places,\" or \"of great renown,\" or \"one who, by his power, makes all his enemies howl\" (on viii. 29, 7); \"hymned by the great\" (on i. 154, 1); \"to be hymned by\nmany great persons\u201d (i. 154, 6). See also i. 155, 4; vi. 28, 4; vi. 65, 6; vii. 35, 15; x. 109, 7, where Prof. Roth considers the word to be a substantive. Looking to R.V. i. 22, 16 ff., about the striding of Vishnu, there can be little doubt that the adjective urug\u0101ya means \u201cwide-striding.\u201d\n\nRud\u0101ra occurs in R.V. viii. 48, 10, as an epithet of Soma, and is interpreted by Y\u0101ska (vi. 4) in his explanation of part of that verse as = m\u1e5b\u1e0d\u0101dara, and as meaning \u201csoft-bellied,\u201d or \u201csoft in (men\u2019s) bellies.\u201d S\u0101yana (on the same verse) renders it, \u201cnot hurting the belly\u201d (udar\u0101bdhakena). On ii. 33, 5, where the word is applied to Rudra, he adopts the first of Y\u0101ska\u2019s two meanings; whilst on iii. 54, 10, where it is applied to the \u0100dityas, he repeats both of his predecessor\u2019s interpretations, modifying the second so as to signify, \u201cthose in whose bellies Soma is soft.\u201d\n\nRjishin, according to Y\u0101ska (v. 12, where he explains R.V. x. 89, 5), means Soma, but is also an epithet of Indra. \u201cThat which remains of soma when it is being purified is rjisha, or rejected; therefore rjishin is soma. There is also a text referring to Indra as rjish\u012b vajr\u012b.\u201d Mahidhara, on V\u0101j. S. xix. 72, says that rjisha is the squeezed and juiceless refuse of the soma-plant. S\u0101yana generally interprets the word rjishin as an epithet of Indra by, \u201che who has the soma after it has been pressed and has lost its juice or taste\u201d (on iii. 32, 1; iii. 36, 10; iv. 16, 1, 5; vi. 20, 2). On i. 64, 12, and i. 87, 1, where rjishin is an epithet of the Maruts, he explains that at the third libation when those deities are worshipped this rjisha is offered, and hence they are said to have it. On v. 40, 4 (where the word is applied to Indra) he says that after the soma has been offered at the first and second libations, and has become juiceless, that which is offered at the third libation is called rjisha = soma. On iii. 46, 3, he makes rjishin simply equivalent to somav\u0101n, \u201chaving soma.\u201d In two places, however, where the word is applied to the Maruts, S\u0101yana gives alternative interpretations, viz., on ii.\n\n---\n\n1 The Sanskrit scholar may also examine Y\u0101ska\u2019s desperate attempt (vi. 33) to explain the two words rd\u0101p\u0101 and rd\u0101vrdh, which occur in R.V. viii. 66, 11. S\u0101yana merely repeats Y\u0101ska; but his text of the passage differs somewhat from Roth\u2019s.\n34, 1, he says it means either \"having water,\" or \"having tasteless soma;\" and on i. 87, 1, \"either having such soma, or, being providers (?) of moisture\" (pr\u0101rjayit\u0101ro ras\u0101n\u0101m). In i. 32, 6, where the word rjisha (not -shin) is applied to Indra, S\u0101ya\u1e47a makes it = satr\u016b\u1e47\u0101m ap\u0101rjakam, \"repeller of enemies.\" It thus appears that he wavers in his interpretation. The sense of \"drinker of tasteless or spiritless soma\" is not a very probable one. Indra is generally represented as greatly exhilarated by the beverage he quaffs, and it seems a poor compliment to him to call him the drinker of a vapid draught. Besides, in one of the texts of which rjishin is the first word, soma-p\u0101van, a term which indubitably means soma-drinker, is found at the end of the same line, and it is unlikely that two epithets so closely resembling each other as \"soma-drinker\" and \"spiritless-soma-drinker\" should occur so near. In his glossary to the S\u0101ma-veda, and in his translation of S.V. i. 248 and ii. 789, Prof. Benfey renders the word by \"victorious;\" and it appears from his note on the last of these two texts that the commentator there gives a choice of interpretations. Prof. Roth s.v. translates it by \"forward-rushing;\" and Benfey, in his translation of R.V. i. 87, 1, renders it similarly by \"gradaus schreitenden\" (Orient und Occident, ii. 249).\n\nEcay\u0101van, which is not found in the Nirukta, is diversely interpreted by S\u0101ya\u1e47a as = \"moving with horses\" (applied by him to the Maruts, i. 90, 5); as = \"going to the hymn or sacrifice to which they should go\" (ii. 34, 11, spoken of the same); as = \"moving with horses, or with the waters of the atmosphere,\u2014coming with showers for the pleasure of others also\" (vi. 48, 12, evay\u0101var\u012b, spoken of the cow); or as = \"bringing to his worshippers the objects which they desire to obtain\" (on vii. 100, 2, spoken of Vish\u1e47u).\n\nK\u0101\u1e47uk\u0101 is one of the terms objected to by Kautsa as obscure (see above). It occurs only once, in R.V. viii. 66, 4; and Y\u0101ska does his utmost to explain it in Nir. v. 11. The whole verse runs thus: \"Indra drank at one draught thirty lakes (or cups) of soma. . . . .\", the word k\u0101\u1e47uk\u0101 being the last of the verse. Y\u0101ska takes it either for a neuter plural, agreeing\nwith sar\u0101msi (cups) and meaning \u201cdesired\u201d (k\u0101ntak\u0101ni), or \u201centirely full\u201d (kr\u0101ntak\u0101ni), or \u201cproperly formed\u201d (krtak\u0101ni), or for an epithet of Indra, signifying \u201cfond or beloved of soma\u201d (somasya k\u0101ntah), or \u201covercome by love of soma\u201d (ka\u1e47e gh\u0101\u1e6da iti va ka\u1e47e hata\u1e25 k\u0101ntihata\u1e25). \u201cThe ritualists\u201d (yajnik\u0101\u1e25), (Y\u0101ska proceeds), \u201csay that the thirty bowls which are destined for one deity at the mid-day libations, and are drunk off at once, are denoted in this verse by the word sar\u0101msi, whilst the etymologists (nairukt\u0101\u1e25), consider that they stand for the thirty nights and days constituting respectively the first and second halves of the month. In the second half the rays drink up the collected waters of the moon.\u201d According to the latter interpretation, Indra is (as S\u0101ya\u1e47a remarks) the deity personifying time (k\u0101l\u0101bhim\u0101ni). In his explanation S\u0101ya\u1e47a merely abridges Y\u0101ska\u2019s.\n\nK\u0101rudhayah is in three places (vi. 21, 8 : vi. 24, 2 ; vi. 44, 12) explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a as \u201cupholder of poets or worshippers\u201d (k\u0101r\u016b\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 dh\u0101rakah, or dh\u0101rayit\u0101.) In another passage (iii. 32, 10) he gives a different sense, \u201cmaker of works\u201d (karm\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 vidh\u0101t\u0101). This latter sense would be appropriate enough here if it exists in the component elements of the word.\n\nKiyedh\u0101\u1e25 is explained by Y\u0101ska (vi. 20, where he quotes R.V. i. 61, 12), in two ways, as = either to kiya\u1e0ddh\u0101\u1e25 \u201cholding how much?\u201d or to kramam\u0101\u1e47a-dh\u0101\u1e25, \u201cholding those who advance.\u201d S\u0101ya\u1e47a, on i. 61, 6, renders it by balar\u0101n, \u201cstrong,\u201d and declares the two interpretations of the Nirukta to mean (1) \u201cone who has strength of which no one knows the extent,\u201d and (2) \u201cone who stops the advancing might of others. On verse 12 of the same hymn, he repeats the same explanations. It appears from Roth\u2019s Illustrations, in loco, that Durga, the commentator on the Nirukta, refers the epithet to V\u1e5bttrn, whilst others referred it to Indra. And Roth remarks, that by his double interpretation, \u201cholding how much (water or power)?\u201d and \u201cholding the advancing (waters or hostile powers),\u201d Y\u0101ska has left the application to one or other of these personages open.\n\nKuchara is explained by Y\u0101ska i. 20 (where R.V. i. 154, 2,\nis quoted), as meaning (if applied to a wild beast) \"doing an evil deed,\" or if taken for a designation of the god (Vishnu), as signifying \"whither does he not go?\" S\u0101yana, on the same passage, gives it the sense either of \"door of evil deeds, such as killing,\" or \"going to inaccessible places,\" or, if understood of the gods, as meaning either \"doing evil deeds, such as the slaughter of enemies,\" or \"one who ranges in all places throughout the three worlds.\" (Kushu, sarv\u0101su bh\u016bmishu, lokatraye, sanch\u0101rt.) We have thus between Y\u0101ska and S\u0101yana three derivations, according as we conceive the word to be compounded of ku, \"bad,\" ku, \"earth,\" or kva, \"where,\" prefixed to chara, \"going,\" or \"acting.\" Such a play upon words in a double sense, though common enough in the modern rhetorical poetry of the Hindus, is scarcely to be looked for in the ancient hymns of the Veda.\n\nKun\u0101ru is explained by Y\u0101ska (Nir. vi. 1, where he quotes R. V. iii. 30, 8) as meaning a \"cloud\" (parikvananam megham). S\u0101yana (on the same passage) gives two interpretations of the words sahad\u0101num kshiyantam sam pi\u1e47ak kun\u0101rum, viz., either (1) \"crush the destroying (kshiyantam) kundru = a certain yelling Asura, associated with D\u0101nu, V\u1e5bttra's mother, or with the D\u0101navas,\" or (2) \"Crush the thundering (kundru) V\u1e5bttra, having the gift of bestowing water (sahaddanum), dwelling (kshiyantam) in the sky.\" Thus there are no less than three words in this single line (viz., sahad\u0101num, kshiyantam, and kun\u0101rum), of which S\u0101yana offers alternative explanations.\n\nKshayadrtra does not occur in the Nirukta. It is variously explained by S\u0101yana as \"very strong, he in whom all heroes are destroyed\" (on i. 106, 4); or, \"he in whom heroes perish, or whose sons, the Maruts, rule\" (on i. 114, 1, 2); or \"he who has heroes, sons and servants, dwelling with him\" (on i. 125, 3); or \"possessed of heroes, sons and others, dwelling or moving\" (nivasadbhir itcarair v\u0101, on R.V. viii. 19, 10). It will be seen, that as regards the root kshi, which forms the first member of this compound, S\u0101yana wavers between the three senses of \"perishing,\" \"ruling,\" and \"dwelling.\"\n\nGirikshit, an epithet of Vishnu (in i. 154, 3), is translated\nby S\u0101ya\u1e47a as \"residing in speech\" (giri locative of gir), or \"in a region high as a mountain.\" In this passage, however, it has, probably, one single sense.\n\nJ\u0101tubharman is not in the Nirukta. S\u0101ya\u1e47a explains it as meaning either \"having the lightning for a weapon,\" or \"supporter of creatures.\"\n\nJ\u0101ray\u0101yi is another of the words objected to by Kautsa as obscure. (See above.) It occurs only once in the R.V., vi. 12, 4, which is quoted by Y\u0101ska in vi. 15, where he explains it by aj\u0101yi, to which his commentator Durga gives the meaning \"is, or was, born.\" (See Roth's Illustrations, etc., p. 82.) S\u0101ya\u1e47a, on the contrary, renders it by st\u016byate \"is praised.\"\n\nJirad\u0101nu is not found in the Nirukta, though jitra is given in the Nigha\u1e47\u1e6dus, ii. 15, as one of the synonymes of kshipra, \"quick.\" In one passage (i. 165, 15) it is rendered by S\u0101ya\u1e47a jaya-\u015b\u012bla-d\u0101nam, \"having victorious gifts;\" but in all the following texts he takes it for, \"whose gifts are quick\" (ii. 34, 4; v. 53, 5; v. 54, 9; v. 62, 3; v. 83, 1; vii. 64, 2; viii. 51, 3).\n\nJoshav\u0101ka is found in R.V. vi. 59, 4, and is explained by Y\u0101ska (v. 21, 22, where he quotes this passage) as \"that of which the name is unknown, that which is to be pondered (?)\" avij\u00f1\u0101ta-n\u0101madheyam joshayitavyam bhavati). He renders the whole verse thus: \"Ye, o Indra and Agni, eat the offering of the man who praises you when the soma libations are poured out. Ye do not eat (that) of the prater (?) who speaks josha\u1e47\u1e0daka.\" S\u0101ya\u1e47a renders: \"Ye, o Indra and Agni, do not eat the (offering) of the man who, when the soma-libations are poured out, praises you badly, who, in the midst of them, speaks unpleasing words when he ought to speak pleasing ones.\" It is to be observed, however\u2014and I perceive that Wilson also, in his note on the passage, has adverted to the fact\u2014that in the quotation made from Y\u0101ska (v. 22) in M\u00fcller's edition of the R.V., the reading of the passage is different from what it is in Professor Roth's edition, as in Roth's text the first clause has no negative particle (na), whilst the negative particle is found there in M\u00fcller's. The meaning of that clause of the Nirukta is thus reversed. The\nsense given by Roth's reading appears to me to be the most conformable to the apparent meaning of Y\u0101ska, as two kinds of worshippers evidently appear to be contemplated in his explanation, one of whom the two gods approve and whose oblation they eat, and another whose oblation they do not eat. S\u0101ya\u1e47a, in conformity with the reading of Y\u0101ska given by M\u00fcller, makes both clauses of the verse relate to one kind of worshipper, i.e., to one whose offering the two gods disapprove. There would thus appear to be a difference between Y\u0101ska and S\u0101ya\u1e47a as to the sense of the verse of the R.V. which they are expounding. What is its real sense, it is not necessary for me to decide. Roth considers that the future participle joshayitavyam, employed by Y\u0101ska, means \"requiring consideration.\" Wilson renders the clause of which it forms a part, \"that being of unknown name is to be propitiated.\" (Compare Roth's Lexicon, s.v., and his remarks in his Illustr. of Nir. p. 68.)\n\nDaksha-pitarah is an epithet of the gods which is not found in the Nirukta. It occurs in three passages of the R.V. On the first (vi. 50, 2) S\u0101ya\u1e47a takes the word for \"those who have Daksha for their forefather,\" and refers to two other texts (R.V. x. 15, 3, and x. 72, 5)), the one to prove that the word pit\u1e5b may stand for \"forefather,\" and the second to show that the gods are elsewhere declared to have Daksha for their ancestor. On the second passage (vii. 66, 2) S\u0101ya\u1e47a translates the word by \"preservers, or lords, i.e. givers, of strength;\" and on the third (viii. 52, 10) by \"preservers, lords, of food.\" The word also occurs in the Taittiriya Sanhita, i. 2, 3, 1, where the commentator explains it much as S\u0101ya\u1e47a on vi. 50, 2, does; and in V\u0101j. S. xiv. 3, where it is explained by \"preserver of vigour.\"\n\nDanah is a word occurring in R.V. i. 174, 2, in regard to which Y\u0101ska (vi. 31) and S\u0101ya\u1e47a contradict each other; the former taking it for an adjective meaning \"liberally-minded\" (d\u0101na-manasah), whilst the latter makes it a verb in the second person singular imperfect, meaning either \"thou didst subdue,\" or \"thou didst cause to cry.\"\n\nDasr\u0101, a frequent dual epithet of the \u0100\u015bvins, and sometimes\nof other gods (Indra and Vishnu, vi. 69, 7), is explained by Y\u0101ska (vi. 26, where he quotes R.V. i. 117, 21), as = dar\u015baniyau, \u201cto be seen, sightly.\u201d S\u0101ya\u1e47a sometimes understands it in that sense (as on i. 47, 6; i. 117, 5, 20, 21; i. 118, 3; i. 120, 4; vi. 69, 7; viii. 22, 17); sometimes as \u201cdestroyers of enemies\u201d (on i. 92, 16; i. 139, 3; i. 158, 1; i. 180, 5; i. 182, 2; i. 183, 4; iii. 58, 3; iv. 43, 4; v. 75, 2); once, at least, as either \u201cdestroyers of enemies,\u201d or \u201cfrom their being the physicians of the gods, destroyers of diseases\u201d (on i. 3, 3); sometimes as either \u201cto be seen,\u201d or as \u201cdestroyers of enemies\u201d (on viii. 5, 2; viii. 8, 1; viii. 26, 6; viii. 75, 1); sometimes as gods \u201chaving the name of Dasr\u0101,\u201d or as \u201cto be seen\u201d (on i. 116, 10). See my article on the Asvins, above, p. 5, note. It appears from Roth\u2019s Illustrations of Nirukta, p. 92, that Durga, the commentator on the Nirukta, explains Dasr\u0101 by \u201cdestroyers of enemies,\u201d or \u201ccausers of works, agriculture,\u201d etc.\n\nD\u012bvisht\u012b is explained by Y\u0101ska (vi. 22, where he quotes R.V. viii. 4, 19), as, in the loc. pl. = dirah eshaneshu, \u201clongings after the sky.\u201d S\u0101ya\u1e47a, on the same passage, makes it mean \u201csacrificial rites which are the causes of obtaining heaven.\u201d Similarly, on iv. 9, 2, he makes it = y\u0101geshu, \u201csacrifices.\u201d On iv. 46, 1, he takes it for \u201csacrifices which confer heaven,\u201d or \u201cour longings after heaven being the causes.\u201d And, again, on iv. 47, 1, he interprets it divo dyulokasya eshaneshu satsu, \u201cthere being longings after the sky;\u201d on i. 139, 4, he translates, \u201clongings after heaven, or longings, or goings, of sacrifice which enlightens, being causes;\u201d on i. 86, 4, he renders it by \u201csacrificial days;\u201d on viii. 65, 9, by \u201cthe arrivals of our days, or longings for heaven, being causes;\u201d on vii. 74, 1, by \u201cpeople who desire heaven, priests;\u201d and on i. 141, 6, \u201clongings after days being the cause.\u201d\n\nDriburhas means, according to Y\u0101ska (vi. 17, where he quotes R.V. vi. 19, 1), \u201clord (pariv\u1e5bdhah) in both regions, the middle and the upper\u201d (i.e. atmosphere and sky). S\u0101ya\u1e47a,\n\n---\n\n1 S\u016bya\u1e47a\u2019s note on this verse (iv. 46, 1) affords another instance of his referring to a parallel text (R.V. vii. 92, 1) to prove that the first draught of soma was offered to V\u0101yu.\non the same passage, and also on iv. 5, 3; vii. 24, 2; viii. 15, 2, follows Y\u0101ska. On i. 71, 6, he has, \"grown (vrmhito carddhitah) in the middle and upper regions.\" On i. 114, 10, he makes it, \"lord in the two regions, the earth and the sky, or in the two paths, the southern and the northern, or lord of knowledge and of works.\" On i. 176, 5, he renders it, stotra-hari-rupa-deividha-parivrdha-karmavatah-yajam\u00e1nasya, \"of the worshipper who is eminent in both kinds of worship, i.e. hymns and oblations.\"\n\nNichumpu\u1e47a is explained by Y\u0101ska (v. 17, 18, where he quotes R.V. viii. 82, 22), as a designation of soma, \"that which pleases by being swallowed\" (nich\u00e1nta-pr\u1e47o nichama-nena pr\u1e47\u00e1ti). The ocean, too, he says, is called nichumpu\u1e47a; as is also the avabhrtha (or cleansing of vessels and worshippers after a sacrifice), as that \"in which they sound lowly, or place lowly\" (ntchair asmin krananti ntchair dadhati ili v\u0101). S\u0101ya\u1e47a explains in conformity with Y\u0101ska. The word also occurs in the V\u0101jasaneyi Sanhit\u0101, iii. 48, and viii. 27, on the former of which passages Mahidhara explains it as meaning either \"slow-going\" (nitar\u00e1m chopati mandam gachhati nichumpunah), or \"that in which they sound lowly, perform the rite with a low voice.\" On viii. 27, he mentions only the first of these two explanations. The sense of the word is thus left doubtful.\n\nNaich\u0101\u015bakha and pramaganda are two words occurring in R.V. iii. 53, 14, a text which is quoted and explained in Nir. vi. 32. Y\u0101ska there gives various senses to pramaganda. He first says maganda is \"a usurer.\" The descendant of such a person is pramaganda, \"a person sprung from a very usurious family.\" Or, secondly, the word is = pramadakah, \"one who desires that there should be no future state.\" Or, thirdly, it it is = pandakah, a \"catamite,\" or \"eunuch.\" He derives naich\u0101\u015bakha from ntch\u0101\u015bakha, apparently \"of a low stock.\" S\u0101ya\u1e47a understands it of the property of degraded people. He adopts the first of the three senses of pramaganda proposed by Y\u0101ska. It appears from an objection made to the eternity of the Veda which S\u0101ya\u1e47a quotes in his Introduction, p. 7, and answers in p. 10 (as cited in Sanskrit Texts, iii. 62), that\nPramaganda was considered by the objectors to be the name of a king, and Naich\u0101\u015b\u0101kha that of a town.\n\nNema is given in Nir. iii. 20 as = arddha, \"half,\" in which sense it is taken by S\u0101yana on R.V. v. 61, 8. In other places (i. 54, 8; iv. 24, 4, 5; vi. 16, 18), he translates it by \"these,\" \"some,\" \"others.\" But in viii. 89, 3, he holds it to be the proper name of a descendant of Bhrigu. In this he appears to be wrong. Compare R.V. ii. 12, 5.\n\nNishshidh, nishshidhvan, puru-nishshidh, puru-nishshidhcan. These words are not found in the Nigha\u1e47\u1e6dus or Nirukta. The first of them, which occurs in the R.V. in different numbers and cases, is variously interpreted by S\u0101yana in different places; as = \"constantly discharging rain-clouds\" (on R.V. i. 169, 2); or \"commands, ordinances\" (anu\u1e63\u0101san\u0101ni, iii. 51, 5); or \"destructive light\" (himsik\u0101m diptim, iii. 55, 8); \"hinderers, enemies\" (iv. 24, 1), or \"hindrances to enemies,\" or \"cords to restrain enemies\" (vi. 44, 11). Nishshidhv\u0101ri\u1e25 (the feminine form of nishshidhvan) occurs in iii. 55, 22, where S\u0101yana makes it = nitar\u0101m teat-kart\u1e5bka-siddhimatyah, i.e., \"having eminently perfections created by thee\" (Indra).\n\nPuru-nishshidh is found in i. 10, 5, as an epithet of Indra, and is there translated by S\u0101yana as = \"hinderer of many enemies; and puru-nishshidhvan, in iv. 38, 2, as a designation of Dadhikr\u0101, where it is understood by him in the same sense. It is, therefore, quite impossible to suppose that the commentator could have had any certain tradition of the sense of these words. Prof. Wilson, who translates p\u016brce asya nishshidho martyeshu in iii. 51, 5, by \"many are his [Indra's] prohibitions (against evil enjoined) to men,\" has a note on this verse, in which he remarks that \"a similar phrase in a former passage [i. 10, 5] purunishshidhe has been rendered 'repeller of many foes:' there is no material incompatibility, the latter being a compound epithet, and the substantive in both cases being derived from shidh, to succeed, to go, with the preposi-\n\n1 We have, in his comment on this verse, a further instance of S\u0101yana quoting another passage for illustration, as he here cites i. 10, 5 as referring to Indra's function of command. See further on.\n\n2 This verse is repeated in \u015a\u0101ma-veda i. 363, where Benfey renders it \"vielgebietend,\" \"many ruling.\"\ntion *nir*, out, *ex*, to exclude, to prohibit.\" Prof. Wilson, however, while taking notice of this one passage to which S\u0101ya\u1e47a himself had drawn his attention, has not adverted to the other texts which I have adduced: and when words identical in tenor with those in iii. 51, 5, are repeated in vi. 44, 11, viz., *p\u016brvish te Indra nishshidho janeshu*, he translates them differently, thns: \"many are the hindrances (opposed) to thee amongst men.\" This does not, however, correctly reproduce S\u0101ya\u1e47a's meaning.\n\n*Paritakmy\u0101* is translated \"night\" in Nir. xi. 25, where R.V. x. 108, 1 is explained. This sense is adopted by Prof. M\u00fcller in translating the verse. (Lectures on Language, second series, p. 464, and note.) Prof. Aufrecht, on the other hand, renders the word by \"necessity.\" (Journal of Ger. Or. Society, vol. xiii., pp. 496 and 498.) Prof. Roth, who in his Illustr. of the Nir. had taken the same view, assigns in his Lexicon, s.v., another signification, that of \"wandering,\" as the proper one for this passage. For most other texts of the R.V. he adopts the sense of \"night,\" \"darkness.\" In two passages he gives it the sense of \"causing anxiety,\" \"dangerous.\" S\u0101ya\u1e47a renders the word by \"night\" in i. 116, 15; iv. 43, 3; vi. 24, 9; by \"dark,\" apparently, in v. 30, 13; by \"night,\" or \"battle,\" or \"sacrifice,\" in vii. 69, 4; by \"surrounding,\" (*paritakane nimittabh\u016bte sati*) or \"night\" in iv. 41, 6; by \"battle\" in v. 31, 11; by \"to be gone round, or surrounded,\" as an epithet of *dhane*, wealth, in i. 31, 6; and by \"surrounding,\" as an epithet of *r\u0101tr\u012b*, \"night,\" which goes before, in v. 30, 14. It thus appears that in some places he is uncertain about the sense.\n\n*Paryabh\u016bsha* in R.V. ii. 12, 1, is explained by Y\u0101ska (x. 10) as = *paryabhavat paryag\u1e5bh\u1e47\u0101t paryarak\u1e63ad atyakr\u0101mad iti c\u0101*, i.e., \"overcame, or comprehended, or protected, or surpassed.\" He could not, therefore, it would appear, have been very sure of its meaning. S\u0101ya\u1e47a renders simply *rakshakatrena paryagrahit*, \"surrounded as a protector.\" The same word is found in the imperative (*pari bh\u016bsha*) in R.V. i. 15, 4, where S\u0101ya\u1e47a renders it, \"adorn,\" and Benfey, \"encircle;\" and in i. 31, 2, where S\u0101ya\u1e47a, followed by Benfey, translates the clause, *der\u0101*-\nn\u0101m pari bh\u016bshasi cratam, \"thou adornest the ceremonial (karma) of the gods.\" The same root, preceded by the particle vi, occurs in i. 112, 4, vi bh\u016bshati, where S\u0101ya\u1e47a offers two explanations, \"is diffused,\" or \"eminently adorns,\" and in vi. 15, 9, vi bh\u016bshan, where he renders, \"adorning.\" The word \u0101bh\u016bsha, in R.V. vii. 92, 1 (= V\u0101j. S. vii. 7) is understood by both commentators, S\u0101ya\u1e47a and Mahidhara, in the sense of \"come.\"\n\nP\u0101nta is explained in Nir. vii. 25 (where R.V. x. 88, 1 is quoted) as = p\u0101nty\u0101, \"to be drunk.\" It occurs also in R.V. i. 122, 1, where S\u0101ya\u1e47a renders it by \"preserving, or to be drunk, sacrifice, or instrument of sacrifice.\" On i. 55, 1, also, he gives it the sense of either \"protecting, or to be drunk.\"\n\nPurukshu is not found in the Nirukta; but kshu is given in the Nigha\u1e47\u1e6dus, ii. 7, as a synonyme of anna, \"food.\" S\u0101ya\u1e47a interprets it variously, for the most part as = bahvanna, \"having much food\" (on i. 68, 5; iii. 25, 2; iii. 54, 21; iv. 34, 10; vi. 19, 5); also as = \"greatly renowned\" (ii. 40, 4); as having one or other of the two preceding senses (iv. 29, 5; vi. 68, 6); and, again, as \"having much food, or many cattle\" (vi. 22, 3). The commentator on the Vaj. S., xxvii. 20, renders it \"that which dwells in many\" (bahushu kshiyati nirasati).\n\nPrthup\u0101jas does not occur in the Nirukta; but p\u0101jas is given in the Nigha\u1e47\u1e6dus, ii. 9, as one of the synonymes for bala, \"strength.\" In Nir. vi. 12, it is said to derive its name from preserving. Prthup\u0101jas is variously rendered by S\u0101ya\u1e47a as \"having great strength\" (iii. 27, 5; iv. 46, 5); as \"having great vigour (or lustre,\" tejas, iii. 5, 1; iii. 27, 5); as \"having great strength or much food\" (iii. 3, 1; viii. 5, 2); as \"having great vigour (or lustre) or great velocity\" (iii. 2, 11).\n\nPrthushtuka occurs as an epithet of Siniv\u0101li in R.V. ii. 32, 6. This passage is quoted in Nir. xi. 32, and the word is there explained as either \"broad-loined,\" or \"having broadly plaited (or a broad mass of) hair\" (prthuke\u1e63a-atuke), or prthustuke. S\u0101ya\u1e47a renders by prthu-jaghane prthu-samhate r\u0101, \"having broad loins,\" or \"broadly built\"? The passage\nis repeated in Vaj. S. xxxiv. 10, where Mahidhara makes the word = he prthuke\u1e63a-bh\u0101re mah\u0101stute v\u0101 prthuk\u0101me v\u0101 \u201chaving a large mass of hair, or greatly praised, or having large desires.\u201d On the sense of the word stuk\u0101, compare Weber, Ind. Stud., v. 233 and 237.\n\nPvadivah is met with in the Nigha\u1e47\u1e6du\u015b, iii. 27, as one of the synonymes of pur\u0101\u1e47a, \u201cold.\u201d The same sense is assigned to it in the Nirukta, viii. 19, as well as in iv. 8, where it is rendered by p\u016brveshu api ahassu \u201ceven in former days.\u201d S\u0101ya\u1e47a, in his note on the passage here illustrated by Y\u0101ska (R.V. iii. 47, 1), adheres to the interpretation of the latter. He also retains the sense \u201cold\u201d in i. 53, 2; ii. 3, 1; iii. 36, 2; iv. 6, 4; iv. 7, 8; v. 8, 7; vi. 5, 3; vi. 23, 5; but in iii. 38, 5 and iv. 34, 3 he assigns to the word the meaning of \u201cextremely shining\u201d (prakar\u1e63ena dyotam\u0101na).\n\nBakura is found in R.V. i. 117, 21, a passage quoted by Y\u0101ska (vi. 25, 26), where (after saying that bakura is = bh\u0101skaro bhayankaro bhdsm\u0101no dravati iti v\u0101, \u201cilluminator, terrible, or that which runs shining\u201d) he assigns to the word the sense of \u201clight or water\u201d (jyotish\u0101 udakena v\u0101. S\u0101ya\u1e47a gives it the meaning of the \u201cshining lightning.\u201d Prof. Roth thinks it denotes a wind instrument. Whether he is right or not, it is clear that Y\u0101ska had no certain knowledge of its sense.\n\nBitita, as we are told in Nir. v. 27, means, according to Taittiki, the \u201catmosphere,\u201d the first syllable being from rt, \u201cto go,\u201d and the second being from ir, \u201cto go,\u201d and the whole denoting that wherein the birds or the clouds move. Y\u0101ska then quotes the only passage in which it occurs, R.V. vii. 39, 2 (= Vaj. S. xxxiii. 44), giving it first the sense of atmosphere, and next suggesting the sense of \u201cassemblage of men.\u201d S\u0101ya\u1e47a repeats the two interpretations of Y\u0101ska. Mahidhara adopts the second, but quotes Y\u0101ska.\n\nMadachyut does not occur in the Nirukta. It is generally understood by S\u0101ya\u1e47a as \u201chumbler of the pride of enemies\u201d (on R.V. i. 51, 2; i. 81. 3; viii. 1, 21; viii. 85, 5), or, \u201chumblers of enemies,\u201d viii. 22, 16. But on i. 85, 7, he takes it for \u201cthat which sheds forth joy, the sacrifice.\u201d\nM\u1e5bdhar\u0101ch is explained by Y\u0101ska (vi. 31, where he quotes R.V. i. 174, 2) as = m\u1e5bdu-v\u0101chah \u201csoftly-speaking.\u201d This translation is quoted by S\u0101ya\u1e47a at the end of his note on the passage without remark. His own rendering is different, as he either, according to the interpretation of the Aitihasikas (legendary writers), makes the word = mar\u015bana-vachan\u0101\u1e25, \u201cuttering angry words,\u201d or, according to that of the Naiuktas, takes it as = mar\u015bana-dhvani-yukt\u0101\u1e25, \u201chaving a threatening sound.\u201d On v. 29, 10; v. 32, 8; and vii. 6, 3, he understands the term to stand for \u201cwith organs of speech destroyed,\u201d or \u201cwith speech destroyed;\u201d and on vii. 18, 13, he assigns a sense similar to that given on i. 174, 2, viz., adh\u0101r\u0101cham, \u201cinjurious speaking.\u201d The meanings he assigns are thus mutually inconsistent, as well as at variance with that proposed by Y\u0101ska.\n\nAm\u1e5bdhra occurs frequently in the R.V., as in v. 37, 1; v. 43, 2, 13; vi. 19, 7; vi. 22, 10; vi. 75, 9; vii. 67, 5, in all which places it is rendered by S\u0101ya\u1e47a ahimsita, or hims\u0101-rahita, \u201cuninjured,\u201d or himsitum a\u1e63akya, \u201cuninjurable.\u201d On iii. 58, 8, he translates \u201cnot despised by any one.\u201d On i. 37, 11, besides \u201cuninjurable,\u201d he proposes an alternative sense, \u201cnot wetting,\u201d which Prof. Goldst\u00fccker regards as not very probable (see s.v.). On viii. 69, 2 (where, however, M\u00fcller puts the texts in brackets), he renders it in an active sense, ahinsaka, \u201cnot injuring.\u201d On Vaj. S. xxix. 46, Mah\u0101dhara renders the word \u201chard-limbed, or giving stern commands.\u201d\n\nMehan\u0101 (an undeclined word) is found in Nir. iv. 4 (where R.V. v. 39, 1 is quoted), and is explained as either = mamhanti-yam idhanam, \u201cto be given, wealth,\u201d or me tha na \u201c(that which) I have not here.\u201d S\u0101ya\u1e47a, following Y\u0101ska\u2019s first interpretation, understands mehan\u0101 as = mamhaniya, on v. 38, 3 and v. 39, 1. On viii. 4, 21, repeating both Y\u0101ska\u2019s explanations, he makes it either mamhanty\u0101m pr\u0101sasy\u0101m, \u201claudable,\n\n---\n\n1 The verb mamh is found in Nigh. iii. 20, as signifying \u201cto give.\u201d\n2 See on this word Roth\u2019s Illust. of Nir. p. 39, where other passages in which it occurs are given. Roth mentions that Durga, the commentator on the Nirukta, says that, in the R.V., mehand is one word, whilst in the S\u0101maveda it is considered to be made up of three. On the sense of the term see also Benfey\u2019s Gloss. to S.V., p. 161.\nexcellent,\u201d agreeing with both g\u00e1m (fem.) \u201ccow,\u201d and a\u015bva (masc.) \u201chorse,\u201d or, me iha na; and the latter words he explains thus: \u201cIn this king (iha) there was not (na) to me (me) that gift of excellent wealth.\u201d On viii. 52, 12 (=V.S. 33, 50), he takes the word as = udaka-sechana-yukt\u0101\u1e25, or sechanena yukt\u0101\u1e25, \u201cshedding water.\u201d Mahidhara, on the same verse, explains, \u201cshedders of wealth,\u201d etc., dhan\u0101di-sekt\u0101ra\u1e25. In iii. 49, 3, the word mehandr\u0101\u1e47a is met with, which S\u0101ya\u1e47a explains thus: mihyate sicyate diyate arthibhyah iti mehanam dhanam tadv\u0101n, \u201cmehana is wealth, that which is shed forth, given, to suppliants; he who has it is mehandrat.\u201d\n\nRenukak\u0101\u1e6da is not mentioned in the Nirukta. It is found as an epithet of arran, \u201chorse,\u201d in R.V. vi. 28, 4, where S\u0101ya\u1e47a takes it for \u201cstirring up dust,\u201d spoken of a horse come for battle. The word is also found connected with arran in V\u0101j. S. xxviii. 13, where it is differently understood by Mahidhara as follows: k\u0101\u1e6da\u1e25 k\u016bpa\u1e25, kutsit\u0101\u1e25 k\u0101\u1e6da\u1e25 kak\u0101\u1e6da\u1e25, renum-bhi\u1e25 k\u1e5btv\u0101 kak\u0101\u1e6da\u1e25 renumkak\u0101\u1e6da\u1e25, \u201ck\u0101\u1e6da is a well; kak\u0101\u1e6da is a bad well; a bad well with dust is a renumkak\u0101\u1e6da.\u201d Such a well, into which calves and youths fall, is to be removed. Wells, etc., which obstruct sacrifices and offspring are to be removed from the road. Such is this scholiast\u2019s explanation. It will be seen that the two Commentators are far from agreeing, and the word is so constructed that there is no reason to suppose it has both senses.\n\nVarakshitha and varakshase are given in Nigh. iii. 3, among the synonymes of mahat, \u201cgreat;\u201d and in Nir. iii. 13, are said to be derived from the root rach, \u201cto speak,\u201d or from vah, \u201cto carry.\u201d S\u0101ya\u1e47a seems (except in one case, vii. 100, 6), to regard the different forms of this word as coming from rah, \u201cto bring,\u201d and interprets as follows: ravakshu\u1e25, \u201cthey wish to bring\u201d (R.V. i. 64, 3); ati varakshitha, \u201cthou exceedingly wishest to carry, art a supporter of\u201d (i. 81, 5); ditto, \u201cthou exceedingly wishest to carry\u201d (i. 102, 8; iii. 9, 3); varakshitha, \u201cthou wishest to carry all\u201d (ii. 22, 3); varakshe = ur\u0101ha, \u201che carried\u201d (iv. 16, 5); varakshatuh = avahat\u0101m, \u201cthey two carried\u201d (viii. 12, 25-27); anuvavakshitha =\nanuvodhum ichha, \"desire to carry\" (viii. 77, 5). Pravavakshe, in vii. 100, 6, is rendered both by Y\u0101ska (v. 8) and by S\u0101ya\u1e47a in loco, as = prabrushe, \"thou sayest.\" Setting aside the last passage, it appears to me that in most of the rest which I have quoted the sense of \"carrying\" is inappropriate. In i. 64, 3, S\u0101ya\u1e47a has to supply the words, \"what is desired by their worshippers,\" in order to make the word \"bring\" yield a tolerable sense; whilst, if we take the verb to signify \"waxed, grew,\" the meaning will be \"the Rudras waxed like mountains.\" So, too, in i. 81, 5, and i. 102, 8, it makes a better sense to say of Indra, \"thou hast waxed greater than the whole universe,\" than to say, \"thou exceedingly wishest to bear the universe.\" And in iii. 9, 3, where S\u0101ya\u1e47a explains the words ati tr\u1e63\u1e6dam varakshitha, \"thou (Agni) exceedingly wishest to bring, in order to fulfil the desire of thy worshipper, by bestowing an appropriate reward.\" Roth (s. v. tr\u1e63\u1e6da) proposes to render \"thou (Agni) hast overcome that which bites, i.e. the smoke.\" Similarly, in ii. 22, 3; iv. 16, 5; viii. 77, 5, the sense of \"waxing\" seems by far the most appropriate (though not, apparently, in ii. 34, 4). Even in viii. 12, 25\u201327, where at first sight the meaning \"carried\" seems to suit the context,\u2014\"when, Indra, the gods placed thee in the front in the battle, then thy beautiful steeds carried (thee),\"\u2014the other sense, \"grew great,\" would be admissible, especially as there is no noun in the line to be governed by varakshatuh, and as in the next verse following the three where this verb occurs, another verb with that very signification (rar\u1e63dhate, \"grew\") is actually applied to the horses. Other forms of this verb, vakshati and rakshatah, occur in R.V. i. 2, 2; iv. 8, 2; viii. 6, 45; where they are treated by S\u0101ya\u1e47a as futures, or precatives. Can vakshati be a third per. pres., \"he brings?\" \u0100rakshat and rakshat (R.V. x. 20, 10, and x. 176, 2) seem to have the sense of \"bringing.\" Vakshatha occurs as a substantive in vii. 33, 8, where S\u0101ya\u1e47a assigns the sense of prak\u0101\u015ba, \"brightness.\" Perhaps it may mean \"full splendour.\" Roth (Illustr. of Nir. p. 30) thinks the root raksh has the sense of \"waxing;\" so, too, Benfey (gloss to S.V.), who, however, gives it the sense\nof \"carrying\" in R.V. iv. 7, 11. In his translation of i. 64, 3; i. 81, 5; i. 102, 8, he translates \"growing.\" Westergaard also s.v. adopts the sense of \"growing,\" \"being strong,\" etc.\n\nS\u0101rman has in the Nigha\u1e47\u1e6du, iii. 4, the sense of \"house.\" In Nir. ix. 19, 32; xii. 45, it has the meaning of \"refuge\" (\u015bara\u1e47am). In i. 174, 2, S\u0101ya\u1e47a renders \u015barma by sukham yath\u0101 bhavati, \"easily,\" whilst in another verse, vi. 20, 10, where the context is the same, he translates it by \"thunderbolt\" (\u015barma \u015barman\u0101 vajrena).\n\n\u015a\u0101rada, \"autumnal,\" (which is not found in the Nirukta), is a word applied in several passages of the R.V. to the cities of the Dasyus. On i. 131, 4, S\u0101ya\u1e47a explains it as = \"fortified for a year;\" on i. 174, 2, as \"new,\" or \"fortified for a year;\" on vi. 20, 10, as \"belonging to an Asura called \u015aarad.\"\n\nSurudh, in the plural, means, according to the Nirukta, vi. 16, \"waters,\" which \"prevent distress\" (sucham samrun-dhanti). The word is mentioned in two other passages of the Nir. viz., x. 41 and xii. 18 (where R.V. iv. 23, 8, and vi. 49, 8, are cited), in the former of which no further explanation of it is given, whilst in the later (xii.18) it is rendered by dhan\u0101ni, \"riches.\" S\u0101ya\u1e47a, on i. 72, 7, takes the word for \"food which prevents suffering in the shape of hunger\" (kshud-r\u016bpasya sokasya rodhayitr\u012br ishah); on iii. 38, 5, for \"preventives of thirst, waters;\" on iv. 23, 8, for \"waters;\" on vi. 3, 3, for \"preventives of suffering, cows;\" \u00b9 on vi. 49, 8 (=Nir. xii. 18) the same (in opposition to Y\u0101ska, who here renders it \"riches\"); on vii. 23, 2, for \"things which prevent suffering, herbs;\" and on vii. 62, 3, for \"preventioners of suffering,\" but taken as nom. masc. and as an epithet of Varu\u1e47a and other gods; or, optionally, in the accus., for \"plants.\" In i. 169, 8, the word is interpreted of \"distress-preventing desiccating lines of clouds,\" sokasya rodhayitr\u012b\u1e25 \u015bo\u015bak\u0101\u1e25 . . . megha-panktih. R.V. vi. 49, 8, is repeated in the V\u0101j. S. xxxiv. 42, where surudha\u1e25 is explained as \"a means of removing suffering.\"\n\n\u00b9 These cows belong to the R\u0101k\u1e63asas, whom S\u0101ya\u1e47a considers to be denoted by the word aktu, \"night,\" in which such spirits move about.\nSalal\u016bka is explained in Nir. vi. 3 (where the only text in which it occurs, R.V. iii. 30, 17, is cited), as\u2014\"covetous (sam-lubdha), wicked, according to the Nairuktas, or etymologists; or it may be for sarar\u016bka, from sr (to go), reduplicated.\" Durga understands it to mean \"confounded,\" or \"fugitive,\" of the R\u0101kshases. S\u0101yana takes it for sarana-stla, \"moving.\"\n\nSantya is found as an epithet of Agni in R.V. i. 18, 2; i. 36, 2; viii. 19, 26. In the first of these passages S\u0101yana explains it as meaning \"bestower of rewards,\" and in the second as \"liberal,\" deriving it in both cases from the root san, \"to give.\" In the third passage he makes it = sam-bhajantya, \"to be served, or possessed.\"\n\nSarvat\u0101ti is interpreted in Nir. xi. 24 (where R.V. i. 94, 15, is quoted) by sar\u0101\u015bu karma-tatishu, \"in all performances (lit. extensions) of works.\" S\u0101yana on the same passage repeats these words of Y\u0101ska, and adds, \"or to him who is present at all sacrifices.\" On iv. 26, 3, he translates it simply by \"sacrifice.\" On vi. 12, 2, also, he renders it by \"sacrifice\" (\"performed by all,\" sarvais t\u0101yam\u0101ne yajne), or, (taking t\u0101ti for a suffix), the \"totality\" of worshippers (sarvah stot\u0101). On i. 106, 2, he renders it by \"that which is extended by all heroes, battle,\" which sense he also assigns to it in vii. 18, 19. On iii. 54, 11, he gives it the signification of \"every desired good.\" In this last text, where Savit\u1e5b is asked to give the worshippers sarvat\u0101ti (ad asmabhya\u1e41 \u0101sura sarvat\u0101tim), it could not well signify either battle, or sacrifice, or anything but blessing in some form or other. On vi. 56, 6, the scholiast assigns the sense of \"sacrifice,\" or \"the extension of all enjoyments,\" sarresh\u0101\u1e41 bhog\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 vist\u0101r\u0101ya. The word also occurs in ix. 96, 4; x. 36, 14; and x. 100, 1 ff., but S\u0101yana's explanations of those passages are not within my reach. See Prof. Benfey's Excursus on the word sarvat\u0101ti in his \"Orient und Occident,\" ii. 519 ff., referred to in my article on \"Vedic Theogony,\" etc., p. 70, note.\n\nSumajj\u0101ni (not in the Nirukta), is an epithet of Vish\u1e47u in R.V. i. 156, 2. S\u0101yana thinks it may mean one of two things, either \"self-born\" (sumat being = svayam according to Nir. vi. 22, and j\u0101ni being taken for \"birth\"), or \"having a wife\n(j\u0101ni) who gladdens\u201d (sumat being here = sutar\u0101m m\u0101dayati). The epithet will in the latter case be equivalent to the \u201clord of the world-gladdening \u015ar\u012b.\u201d Here we have an importation of later ideas into Vedic mythology. I am not aware of any other passage of the R.V. in which a wife is assigned to Vish\u1e47u. In the V\u0101j. S. xxix. 60, Aditi is called his wife; as Sin\u012bv\u0101li appears to be in A.V. vii. 46, 3.\n\nSpa\u015b, as a verb, is found in R.V. i. 10, 2. where S\u0101yana translates it by \u201ctouched, began;\u201d in i. 22, 19 (= V\u0101j. vi. 14; S\u0101ma-veda, ii. 1021), where he renders it by \u201c(every worshipper) touched, performed,\u201d the root spa\u015b having the two senses of injuring and touching (b\u0101dhana-spar\u1e63anayoh). Mah\u012bdhara on V\u0101j. S. vi. 4, explains the same word by \u201cbound, fashioned,\u201d or \u201cbound in himself,\u201d or \u201cfixed,\u201d spa\u015b having the sense of binding (bandhane). In i. 128, 4, S\u0101yana translates by atyaratham spr\u1e63\u1e6di svkaroti, \u201ctouches exceedingly, accepts,\u201d (the sense of \u201coblations, etc.,\u201d being given to j\u0101t\u0101ni); in i. 176, 3, by b\u0101dhayasva, \u201cinjure.\u201d The verb also occurs without a preposition in x. 102, 8, and with anu prefixed in x. 14, 1, and x. 160, 4. I am not aware what sense S\u0101yana assigns in the first two passages, but in the third he translates anuspa\u015b\u1e6dha by dr\u1e63\u1e6digochara, \u201cvisible\u201d (see Goldst\u00fccker\u2019s Dict. s.v. aratn\u012b).\n\nSpa\u015b, as a noun, is found in R.V. i. 25, 13; i. 33. 8; iv. 4, 3; v. 59, 1; vi. 67, 5; vii. 61, 3; vii. 87, 3; viii. 50, 15; ix. 73, 4, 7; and A.V. iv. 16, 4. In the first passage S\u0101yana renders it, hiranya-spar\u015bino rasmin, \u201cgold-touching, rays;\u201d in the second (i. 33, 8), b\u0101dhak\u0101n V\u1e5bttr\u0101nuchar\u0101n, \u201cthe injurious followers of V\u1e5bttra;\u201d in the third (iv. 4, 3) by parab\u0101dhak\u0101n ra\u015bmin ch\u0101r\u0101n r\u0101, \u201cdestroying others, rays, or spice;\u201d in the fourth (vi. 67, 5) by \u201crays, or spies;\u201d in the fifth (vii. 61, 3)\u00b9 by r\u016bpam, \u201cform;\u201d in vii. 87, 3, by char\u0101h, \u201cspies,\u201d (though here, too, the root spa\u015b is said to have the sense of spr\u1e63, \u201ctouch.\u201d) In v. 59, 1, spat, nom. sing., is said by the scholiast to be = sprasht\u0101 hot\u0101, \u201cpriest;\u201d whilst in viii. 50, 15, where it is an epithet of Indra, he makes it mean sarvasya jn\u0101t\u0101,\n\n\u00b9 In vii. 61, 3, there is another instance of S\u0101yana\u2019s making a reference back to a preceding passage, i. 61, 9. See also his notes on i. 164, 1; ii. 2, 5; iii. 17, 1; vi. 26, 4, vii. 76, 4.\n\"knower of all things.\" The sense of the noun *spa\u015b* is pretty well fixed by A.V. iv. 16, 4, to be generally that of spies or messengers. And I do not see why in some, at least, of the texts of the R.V. above quoted the verb too should not have the sense of \"seeing,\" or \"shewing.\" The root *spa\u015b* has the significations of \"making evident,\" \"informing,\" given to it among others in Wilson's Dictionary. The participles *spashta* and *anuspashta*, \"manifest,\" seem to come from a verb meaning \"to see.\" *Spa\u015b*, \"a spy,\" also appears to be derived from a root having the same sense. And in the cognate languages the root has the same signification. See Roth's Illustrations of the Nirukta, p. 138 f.\n\n*Smaddishti*, *smadishta*, are not to be found in the Nirukta. The former word (divided into *smad* + *dishti* in the Pada text) occurs several times in the R.V., viz., in iii. 45, 5, as an epithet of Indra, where S\u0101yana translates it by *bhadra-v\u0101kya*, \"auspiciously speaking;\" in vi. 63, 9, where he takes it for an epithet of chariots or horses, and renders it \"handsome-looking,\" *prasasta-dar\u015ban\u0101n* (where *dishti* must be taken to stand for *dr\u1e63\u1e6di*); in vii. 18, 23, where it is an epithet of *d\u0101n\u0101\u1e25*, \"horses,\" and is explained by him as \"possessing all the approved attributes of a gift, liberality, faith,\" etc. (*prasast\u0101ti-sarjana-sraddh\u0101di-d\u0101n\u0101\u1e45ga-yukt\u0101\u1e25*). These interpretations seem to be mutually discrepant. His commentary on x. 62, 10, where the word is also found, is not accessible to me. The second word, *smadishta*, differs from the first, in that it ends not in *ti* but in *ta*, and is compounded of *smat* + *ish\u1e6da*, occurs in R.V. vii. 87, 3, where S\u0101yana renders it, \"either good goers, or, sent together,\" according as *smat* is taken in the sense of \"good,\" or \"with.\"\n\n*Kundr\u1e47\u0101c\u1e25i* is explained by S\u0101yana on R.V. i. 29, 6, as denoting the tortuous movement of the wind; whilst in V\u0101j. S. 24, 35, as interpreted by Mahidhara, it signifies some kind of wild animal. The words *pr\u0101vo yudhyantam r\u1e63habham dasadyum* occur both in R.V. i. 33, 14, and in vi. 26, 4, but are differently explained by S\u0101yana in these two places. In the former he renders, \"thou hast preserved the eminent (rishi) Da\u015badyu when fighting;\" whilst in the latter he makes V\u1e5b\u1e63abha a\nproper name and Da\u015badyu an epithet, translating, \"thou hast preserved (the king) V\u1e5b\u1e63abha fighting for ten days.\" This discrepancy is pointed out by Prof. Benfey in his note 294 to the former text (Orient und Occident, i. p. 51), and he then proceeds: \"I am far from imputing this to S\u0101ya\u1e47a as an offence. He was as little aware of it as we are now. I make the remark only for the sake of those who attach so great importance to him that, instead of the Veda, they translate his Commentary, and while doing so, pretend to be giving a translation of the hymns.\"\n\nPr\u1e63\u1e6dha in R.V. i. 98, 2, is explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a as meaning either sa\u1e43spr\u1e63\u1e6dha, \"touched,\" or nishik\u1e6da, nihita, \"shed, placed.\"\n\nPrashti is explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a on R.V. i. 39, 6, as \"a particular kind of yoke between the three animals which draw the chariot,\" etat-sanjinako v\u0101hana-traya-madhy\u0101-var\u1e6d\u1e6di yuga-viseshah. On viii. 7, 28, he takes prashti to mean either \"swift,\" or \"a buck yoked in front.\" See Prof. Wilson's note on the former passage. The words puru\u1e47\u012bth\u0101 jarasa in R.V. vii. 9, 6, are interpreted by S\u0101ya\u1e47a to mean either \"praise with much laudation,\" or \"consume the R\u0101kshassas who move by many paths.\"\n\nGurttasravas is explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a on i. 61, 5, as pra\u1e63asy\u0101nna, \"having approved food;\" and on i. 122, 10, as ud-gur\u1e47a-dipti, prakhy\u0101t\u0101nno v\u0101, \"having exalted light,\" or \"having renowned food.\"\n\nVitaharya, in R.V. vi. 15, 2, is said by S\u0101ya\u1e47a either to mean a rishi so called, or, if Bharadv\u0101ja be the rishi of the hymn, then vitaharya will be an epithet signifying \"he by whom an oblation has been presented.\" The word occurs again in vii. 19, 3, where the scholiast takes it for an epithet of Sud\u0101s, meaning, \"he who has given, or generated, an oblation.\"\n\n\u015ac\u0101itreya, which in R.V. i. 33, 14, is taken by S\u0101ya\u1e47a for a proper name, the son of \u015acitra, is in v. 19, 3, understood of the \"lightning-fire produced in the atmosphere,\" although the word has the appearance of being a proper name in that passage also.\nAkav\u0101ri is not in the Nirukta. It is found in R.V. iii. 47, 5, as an epithet of Indra, and is there explained by S\u0101yana as =prabh\u016bta-satrukam, \u201chaving many enemies,\u201d or akutsit\u0101rim, \u201chaving foes not contemptible.\u201d The last sense he illustrates by a reference to R.V. i. 61, 9, where the epithet sv\u0101ri, \u201chaving glorious enemies,\u201d is applied to Indra, as implying that the vanquisher of such enemies must be most heroic. In vii. 96, 3, akav\u0101rt is spoken of Sarasvat\u012b, and is interpreted in quite a different manner by S\u0101yana, as akutsita-gaman\u0101, \u201cnot badly going.\u201d The first of the preceding verses is repeated in V\u0101j. S. vii. 36, where akav\u0101ri is taken as either \u201che whose enemies even are not bad,\u201d or \u201che who obtains what is not bad,\u201d i.e. \u201chas eminent dominion.\u201d\n\nAkshnay\u0101van is not in the Nirukta, but is found in R.V. viii. 7, 35, where S\u0101yana gives two explanations, viz., either \u201cgoing pervadingly\u201d (vy\u0101ptam gachhantah), or \u201cgoing quicker than even the eye.\u201d\n\nAdha-priya, kadha-priya, kadha-prt. The first of these words occurs as an epithet of the A\u015bvins in R.V. viii. 8, 4, where S\u0101yana offers two interpretations, either (1) \u201cfond of that which exists here below, viz., Soma,\u201d or (2) \u201cfond of praise,\u201d adha standing for kadha, shorn of its initial k. Prof. Roth, s.v., renders, \u201cthen pleased.\u201d Prof. Goldst\u00fccker does not give the word. Kadha-priya is found in R.V. i. 30, 20, as an epithet of Ushas, and kadha-prt in i. 38, 1, and viii. 7, 31, as an epithet of the Maruts, and both terms are uniformly rendered by S\u0101yana \u201cfond of praise,\u201d kadha being said to stand for katha or kath\u0101, \u201cspeaking.\u201d Prof. Roth, s.vv., suggests, \u201cfriendly to whom?\u201d And, certainly, when it is observed that all the three passages in which the two words are found are interrogative, this rendering seems more probable than S\u0101yana\u2019s. Compare ku\u1e25ay\u0101k\u1e5bte in viii. 24, 30. Prof. Benfey translates in i. 30, 20, \u201cwhere lovest thou?\u201d and in i. 38, 1, \u201cwhere do ye like to linger?\u201d\n\nAnarcis. On this word it will be sufficient to quote Prof. Goldst\u00fccker\u2019s explanation in his Dictionary: \u201c(red.) i. A car-man, one going with, or on a cart.\u201d . . . \u201c(or, according to another explanation, which appears, however, to be an arti-\nficial one), ii. one who does not arrive where he is to go to, one not attaining the end or aim of his journey.\u201d The artificial explanation here alluded to is that of S\u0101ya\u1e47a on i. 121, 7.\n\nAmavat is explained by Prof. Roth, s.v., as \u201cviolent,\u201d \u201cstrong,\u201d etc.; and by Prof. Goldst\u00fccker, s.v., \u201cpowerful, mighty, strong.\u201d The latter scholar remarks that \u201cthis meaning of amavat seems to apply satisfactorily to all other instances in which the word occurs. . . . . There are, however, other meanings . . . mentioned by Y\u0101ska, and accordingly by S\u0101ya\u1e47a and Mahidhara, which deserve noticing, not only because the first of them is plausible, but also on account of their high antiquity.\u201d The words of Y\u0101ska (vi. 12) explanatory of the word before us are am\u0101tyar\u0101n abhyamanap\u0101n srav\u0101n r\u0101, i.e., either \u201cwith ministers, or with diseases, or with riches.\u201d See Goldst\u00fccker, s.v. amavat and abhyamanavat. Y\u0101ska seems thus to have been undecided as to the sense. See also S\u0101ya\u1e47a on R.V. iv. 4, 1, and Wilson\u2019s note on the same passage, as also Mahidhara on V\u0101j. S. 13, 9.\n\nAmina is explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a on R.V. vi. 19, as = ahimsantya, \u201cuninjurable;\u201d and on this passage he gives no other sense. Prof. Goldst\u00fccker, s.v., after assigning the two senses (1) \u201cof an unlimited measure or quantity (of strength), or (2) uninjured,\u201d goes on to say: \u201cAccording to Y\u0101ska (vi. 16) the word may have either of these meanings in the following verse of the R.V. (vi. 19, 1);\u201d and quotes Durga, the commentator on Y\u0101ska, to show that the words of the latter are to be so understood. Durga also observes that from the form of the word, and the suitableness of both senses, either is admissible. But we are not yet arrived at an end of the optional meanings proposed for this adjective. I learn from Prof. Goldst\u00fccker\u2019s next article that in another text (R.V. x. 116, 4), where this same term occurs (applied, too, as in vi. 19, 1, along with dvibarhas, as an epithet of Indra), it has two other meanings assigned to it by S\u0101ya\u1e47a, both different from those assigned by Y\u0101ska to the word in R.V. vi. 19, 1 (and one of which he (S\u0101ya\u1e47a) himself adopts in his note on that passage). These two new meanings are \u201cgoing everywhere\u201d (sarvayant\u0101), and \u201call-beloved\u201d (sarvai\u1e25 k\u0101myam\u0101nah).\nCould anything show more demonstratively the conjectural and etymological character of many of S\u0101yana's interpretations?\n\nAmatra is found as an epithet of Indra in R.V. i. 61, 9, where it is explained by S\u0101yana as either = \"expert in moving in battles, etc., or devoid of any limit.\" It is also found in iii. 36, 4, where the Commentator renders it, \"a vanquisher of enemies.\" This latter text is quoted in Nir. vi. 23, where the senses of \"measureless, great, or uninjured,\" are assigned to the word. See Goldst\u00fccker, s.v. abhyamita.\n\nAmitavarna, spoken of the Dawns in R.V. iv. 51, 9, is explained by S\u0101yana as = ahimsitavarn\u0101 aparimitavarn\u0101 v\u0101, \"either of uninjured colour, or of unlimited colour.\" He could not therefore have had any precise idea of the sense.\n\nAmanda, applied to hymns in R.V. i. 126, 1, is by Y\u0101ska, (ix. 10) in his explanation of that passage, rendered as = ab\u0101li\u1e63\u0101n analp\u0101n v\u0101, \"either not foolish, or not few.\" S\u0101yana contents himself with the second sense.\n\nAy\u0101ya has more than one signification assigned to it by S\u0101yana in i. 62, 7, and viii. 51, 2. See Prof. Goldst\u00fccker's Dictionary, s.v.\n\nAptur, said to be derived from ap, \"water,\" and tur, \"to hasten,\" an epithet of the gods in general (R.V. i. 3, 8), of Agni (iii. 27, 11), of Indra (iii. 51, 2, and according to the scholiast, in ii. 21, 5 also, though there it may be a nom. pl.), is declared by S\u0101yana to have in all these passages the sense of \"sender, or senders, of water.\" In i. 118, 4, where it is an epithet of the horses (according to S\u0101yana), or the falcons, of the A\u015bvins, he ascribes to it the signification of \"quick like the waters\" (\u0101pa iva traropet\u0101\u1e25). Prof. Goldst\u00fccker follows the Scholiast in assigning to it both these senses, viz.: \"(1) sending water (i.e. rain), an epithet of Indra, Agni, etc.; (2) quick as water (i.e. as the falling rain), an epithet of the horses of the A\u015bwins.\" I confess I do not think the commentator's opinion a sufficient reason for concluding that the word has two different meanings. It also occurs in R.V. ix. 61, 13 = S.V. i. 487, where Prof. Benfey renders it \"flood-conquering\" (while in his Glossary he makes it \"water-shedding\"). In his translation of R.V. i. 3, 8, in Orient\nund Occident, he gives it the sense of \"active in works,\" and in i. 118, 4, of \"hastening through the air.\" Prof. Roth, in his Lexicon, s.v., renders it \"active, zealous.\" The substantive apturyam is rendered with some variation by S\u0101yana in two passages, R.V. iii. 12, 8, and iii. 51, 9, as vrshti-dv\u0101r\u0101 prerakatvam, \"the quality of impelling (or stimulating) by means of rain,\" and ap\u0101m prerane, \"in the impelling (or sending) of rain.\"\n\nIn R.V. iii. 27, 11, the word yanturam, an epithet of Agni, is explained as either = sarvasya niyant\u0101ram, \"the controller of all things,\" or kshipram gant\u0101ram, \"quickly going.\"\n\nArdhadeva, in R.V. iv. 42, 8, is interpreted by S\u0101yana as either \"near the gods,\" or \"half a god.\"\n\nAsa\u1e63chat is a participle of frequent occurrence in the R.V. One of the passages in which it is found, vi. 70, 2, is quoted in Nir. v. 2, where it is said to be equivalent to asajyam\u0101ne, \"not attached together,\" or vyudasyantya; \"throwing apart, scattering.\" S\u0101yana on this verse merely repeats Y\u0101ska. In i. 160, 2, where the word is again an epithet of heaven and earth, he explains it similarly, asajyam\u0101ne paraspara-viyukte, \"not attached, separate from each other.\" In i. 112, 2, he takes it for an epithet of the worshippers, in the sense of anyatr\u0101n\u0101sakt\u0101\u1e25, \"not attached to any one else.\" In vii. 67, 9, it is an epithet of the A\u015bvins, and is in like manner interpreted by him kutr\u0101py asajyam\u0101nau, \"not attached anywhere. In iii. 57, 6, he connects it with pramati, \"the design\" or \"disposition\" of Agni, derives it from sa\u1e63ch, \"to go,\" and explains it asmad anyatra sangatim akurr\u0101\u1e47\u0101, \"not forming an union with any one but us.\" In ii. 32, 3, it is an epithet of dhenu, \"cow,\" and he there renders it asakt\u0101vayar\u0101\u1e41, \"having her members unattached\" (to what?). In ii. 25, 4, where he regards it as an epithet of \"waters,\" (understood), he explains it, asajyam\u0101n\u0101\u1e25, aniruddh\u0101\u1e25, \"unattached, unobstructed.\" In viii. 31, 4, where it is an epithet of il\u0101, \"food,\" he derives it from sa\u1e63ch, \"to go,\" and renders it by agamana-\u1e63\u1e6dilam, \"that whose character is not to go, or depart.\" In i. 13, 6, and i. 142, 6 (two verses which are partly identical in contents), the word asa\u1e63chata\u1e25 is an epithet of\ndv\u0101ra\u1e25, \"doors.\" In the former of the two texts (i. 13, 6), S\u0101yana renders it udgh\u0101tanena pravesht\u1e5b-purusha-sanga-rahit\u0101\u1e25, \"destitute of the contact or presence of persons entering in consequence of their being opened\" (i.e. as Prof. Wilson explains \"[hitherto] unentered\"); whilst in the second passage (i. 142, 6) he renders asajjam\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 paraspara-viprak\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e25,\u00b9 \"not attached or joined, distant or apart from each other.\"\n\nThe renderings in the last two (parallel) passages seem to be mutually inconsistent, as the latter appears to mean that the doors, of which the two halves stood apart, were open, whilst the former, although we adopt Prof. Wilson's addition of \"hitherto,\" imports that although they were about to be opened, they were still closed. In i. 13, 6, Rosen translates, \"non frequentat\u00e6\" (which does not differ materially from Wilson's rendering); but in his note, subsequently composed, he says he should (in addition to other changes) prefer to interpret the word under consideration \"non clausea.\" I observe that in the quotation which he there adduces from S\u0101yana's Commentary, his reading differs from that given by M\u00fcller, in adding a negative particle, as it runs thus, udgh\u0101tanena na purusha-sanga-rahit\u0101\u1e25, which would make the sense, \"doors which from their being opened are not destitute of the contact or presence of persons entering.\" Westergaard, s.v. sa\u1e63ch, follows Rosen's note in rendering asaschata\u1e25 by \"porte non clausea.\" S\u0101yana, on i. 13, 6, derives the word from sa\u1e63j, \"to go,\" with a negative prefixed, but in the passages where he renders it by asajjam\u0101na, or an\u0101sakta, \"not attached,\" he must, I suppose, be understood to ascribe to this root the sense of \"being joined, or attached.\" Wilson, in his note on i. 142, 6, has noticed the variations in S\u0101yana's rendering of the term asaschata\u1e25. In addition to this discrepancy between his translations of i. 13, 6 and i. 142, 6, I have to observe that S\u0101yana's explanation of the word in viii. 31, 4, as meaning \"that which does not depart,\" seems to be scarcely consistent.\n\n\u00b9 I should add that S\u0101yana here offers alternative renderings both of asaschata\u1e25\u2014making it a masc. pl. with the sense, \"devoid of persons entering,\"\u2014and of the verb vipravayant\u0101m, which he says may be explained not only \"let them be opened,\" but \"let them seek, or approach\" (sevanti\u1e41).\nwith the signification \"unobstructed,\" which he assigns in ii. 25, 4, which implies that the waters could depart elsewhere. At all events, the two meanings are quite different. I have no access to S\u0101yana's explanations of the word where it occurs in the ninth and tenth books of the R.V.; but R.V. ix. 57, 1, is repeated in the S\u0101ma-veda, ii. 1111, where I find from Prof. Benfey's Glossary that the Scholiast renders it sanga-rahita, \"free from contact.\" Benfey himself, in his Glossary, translates it \"free from pursuers, unhindered,\" or, when spoken of rain, \"thick.\" In his translation of the passage of the S.V. however, he renders the word by \"lovely;\" and the cognate word asa\u1e63chusht in S.V. ii. 502, by \"kindly-disposed.\" In his translation of R.V. i. 13, 6, in Orient und Occident, Benfey renders asa\u1e63chata\u1e25, \"good\" (from a privative and sa\u1e63chat, \"persecuting, enemy\"); but in i. 112, 2, he gives \"inexhaustible\" (unversiegbar) as its equivalent. Prof. Roth (see his Lexicon, s.v.) proposes to render \"unfailing.\" On the whole I think that the senses proposed by S\u0101yana are either too various, too vague, or too forced, to be admitted as satisfactory, and have very much the appearance of being conjectural.\n\n\u0100hanas is understood by Y\u0101ska (iv. 15, in his interpretation of R.V. ix. 75, 5, where it occurs in the plural as an epithet of mad\u0101h, \"intoxicating draughts\"), as = \u0101hananarantah, \"smiting.\" In his explanation (N\u012br. v. 2) of R.V. x. 10, 8, where it is an epithet of Yam\u012b, he adheres to the same etymology, and makes it signify \"smiting as it were with uncivil words\" (\u0101ham\u015btra bh\u0101sham\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d iti asabhya-bh\u0101sham\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d \u0101han\u0101 iva bharati etasm\u0101d \u0101han\u0101 sy\u0101t). I have not access to S\u0101ya\u1e47a's Commentary on these two verses, or on x. 125, 2; but on ii. 13, 1 (where he applies it to Soma) he takes it in a passive sense, \"to be smitten, to be poured out\" (\u0101hantaryo 'bhishotavyah), while on v. 42, 13, he gives it the active signification of \u0101hant\u0101 sekt\u0101, \"smiter, shedder.\" It seems unlikely that the term should have both these senses.\n\n\u0100tuje in R.V. vii. 32, 9, is explained by S\u0101yana as an epithet (in the dative) of Indra, with the meaning either \"of destroyer of enemies, or giver of wealth.\" M\u00fcller makes it\nmean \"to give.\" The last words of the verse, na dev\u0101sah kavatnave, are rendered by M\u00fcller (Anc. Sansk. Lit. p. 544), \"the gods are not to be trifled with.\" Wilson has, \"the gods favour not the imperfect rite.\" In his note he shows a curious misapprehension of S\u0101yana when he says: \"The scholiast seems to render it, men do not become gods by such means, dev\u0101 na bhavanti.\" These last words merely mean, as I take them: \"The gods are not for (i.e., are not favourers of) a kavatnu;\" whether that adjective means, as Roth, s.v., proposes, \"a niggard,\" or, possibly,\u2014as may be suggested, if we regard it as in opposition to the word tarani in the preceding clause,\u2014\"an inert or timid man.\" In illustration of the construction, compare iv. 33, 11, na rte \u015br\u0101ntasya sakhy\u0101ya der\u0101h, \"the gods [are not disposed] for the friendship of the man who is tired of sacred rites\" (though S\u0101yana renders differently); and vii. 61, 5, na v\u0101m ninj\u0101ny achite abhi\u015bvan, \"your secret things are not for the unthinking man.\" (Wilson does not translate S\u0101yana accurately here).\n\nIn R.V. i. 84, 16, S\u0101yana assigns to the word ka\u1e25 the optional senses of \"who?\" or of \"Praj\u0101pati,\" and to g\u0101\u1e25 those of \"horses,\" or \"words of the Veda.\"\n\nDhiy\u0101rasu is an epithet of Sarasvat\u012b in i. 3, 10 (= V\u0101j. S. 20, 84), and of Agni in iii. 3, 2, and iii. 28, 1. Y\u0101ska comments on the first of these passages in Nir. xi. 26, and there explains dhiy\u0101rasu by the vague equivalent karmanasu, which may mean, \"rich in works,\" or \"she who through works confers wealth.\" This last sense, though not in itself obvious, is the one extracted from the compound by S\u0101yana, who render skarma-pr\u0101pya-dhana-nimitta-bh\u016bt\u0101, \"she who is the cause of the wealth which is to be acquired through works.\" He afterwards repeats the same explanation in the words, dhiy\u0101 karman\u0101 vasu yasy\u0101\u1e25 sak\u0101\u015b\u0101d bhavati s\u0101 dhiy\u0101vasu\u1e25. On iii. 28, 1 he interprets similarly, and Mah\u0101dhara on V\u0101j. S. 20, 84, not very differently. On R.V. iii. 3, 2, however, S\u0101yana gives the word a totally different sense, prajnay\u0101 vy\u0101pt\u0101\u1e25, \"pervaded by wisdom.\"\n\nVidadvasu is variously explained by S\u0101yana in three different passages, i. 6, 6; v. 39, 1; viii. 55, 1. In the first,\nwhere he takes it for an epithet of the Maruts, he makes it signify *tedayadbhi\u1e25 sva-mahima-prakhy\u0101pakair vasubhir dhanair yuktam*, \"possessed of riches which make known their greatness.\" Further on he gives the additional explanation, *aud\u0101ry\u0101ti\u1e63ayavattay\u0101 jn\u0101payanti vas\u016bni dhan\u0101ni yam sa vidadcasuh*, \"he whom his riches make known as exceedingly generous is riddadrseu.\" In v. 39, 1, the word is applied to Indra, and there the Scholiast gives it the sense of *labdha-dhana*, \"he by whom wealth has been obtained.\" In viii. 55, 1, where it is an epithet of the same god, it is declared by S\u0101ya\u1e47a to mean *vedayadrasum dhanavedakam*, the god \"who makes known riches.\" The term, however, was most probably intended by the authors of the hymns to have but one sense.\n\n*Gabhasti*, in R.V. i. 54, 4, is interpreted by S\u0101ya\u1e47a as either \"taken with the hand,\" or \"having rays.\"\n\n*Hv\u0101rya*, in R.V. v. 9, 4, receives from S\u0101ya\u1e47a a threefold interpretation, viz. either (1) \"a wriggling serpent,\" or (2) \"a horse performing the \u0101skandita and other tortuous movements,\" or (3) \"an unbroken colt.\" Compare Wilson's note.\n\n*Ka\u1e63\u0101* means a \"whip,\" but in the Nigha\u1e47\u1e6dus i. 11, it is also said to be one of the fifty-six synonymes of *v\u0101ch*, \"speech.\" In R.V. i. 22, 3, and i. 157, 4, mention is made of the *ka\u1e63\u0101 madhumati* or \"honied whip\" of the \u0100\u015bvins, and they are asked to moisten with it the sacrifice or the worshippers. In both these places S\u0101ya\u1e47a gives an optional rendering of *ka\u1e63\u0101*, as signifying either \"whip,\" or \"speech.\" Mahidhara on V\u0101j. S. 7, 11, gives the word the sense of \"speech\" only. See Note 1 in p. 363 of my Article on the \"Progress of the Vedic Religion,\" etc., in the last volume of this Journal.\n\n*Krandasi* is interpreted by S\u0101ya\u1e47a on R.V. ii. 12, 8, as either \"heaven and earth making a sound,\" or \"two armies, human and divine.\" On vi. 25, 4, he takes it for two disputants \"crying and abusing\" each other (*krandam\u0101\u1e47av \u0101kro\u1e63antau*). I have not access to his commentary on x.\n\n---\n\n1 Y\u0101ska quotes this verse (Nir. iv. 4) and explains *vidadrasu* by *vittadhasu*, which may mean either \"he by whom wealth is known,\" or \"by whom wealth has been obtained.\"\nbut I observe that Prof. M\u00fcller in his translation of the hymn (Anc. Sansk. Lit., p. 569) renders the term by \"heaven and earth,\" which is also the only sense assigned to it by Mahidhara on V\u0101j. S. 32, 7, where the verse is repeated.\n\n*Nabhanya* is explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a in i. 149, 3, as = *nabhasi bhavo nabhasv\u0101n r\u0101yuk*, \"that which is produced, or exists, in the sky, the wind;\" in i. 173, 1, as = *nabhasyam nabhasi bhavam nabhy\u0101pinam himsakam v\u0101 r\u0101k\u1e63as\u0101dikasya*, either \"etherial, pervading the sky,\" or \"destructive of R\u0101k\u1e63asas,\" etc.; and in vii. 42, 1, as = *stotra*, \"a hymn.\"\n\n*N\u1e5bchakshas*, which is not in the Nirukta, is generally translated by S\u0101ya\u1e47a, \"beholder of men\" (R.V. iv. 3, 3; vii. 60, 2), or, \"beholder of the conductors of rites\" (*n\u1e5bnam* being taken as = *karma-net\u1e5b\u1e47\u0101m*). In i. 22, 7, however, though said to mean primarily, \"he who sees men\" (*n\u1e5b\u1e45g chashte*), it is (as an epithet of Savitri) explained by the words, \"illuminator of men\" (*manushy\u0101\u1e47\u0101m prka\u015ba-k\u0101r\u012bnam*); and in i. 91, 2, by \"he who shows to the conductors of sacrifices the desired fruit (of their rites).\"\n\n*S\u016brachakshas* is found in Nir. xi. 16 (where R.V. i. 110, 4, is explained) as an epithet of the Ribhus. Y\u0101ska gives it the sense of \"sun-speaking (?) or sun-wise,\" *s\u016bra-khy\u0101n\u0101 v\u0101 s\u016bra-praj\u00f1\u0101 v\u0101*. S\u0101ya\u1e47a does not adhere to more than one of Y\u0101ska's renderings, and proposes *s\u016brya-sam\u0101na-prak\u0101\u015b\u0101h s\u016brya-sad\u1e5b\u1e63a-j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101 v\u0101*, \"having splendour like the sun,\" or \"having knowledge like the sun.\" The word also occurs in R.V. i. 16, 1, where S\u0101ya\u1e47a takes it for *s\u016brya-sam\u0101na-prak\u0101\u015ba-yukt\u0101 rtvij\u0101\u1e25*, \"having splendour like the sun, priests.\" The correctness of this last interpretation seems very doubtful; and I do not see why the word should not be, as Benfey makes it (Or. und Occ.), an epithet of *harayah*, Indra's tawny horses. If so, the verse would run thus: \"Let the tawny horses bring thee, the vigorous, to the soma-draught, Indra, thee, the sun-eyed steeds.\" The sense of \"eye\" or \"sight\" is assigned by S\u0101ya\u1e47a in v. 66, 6, to *chakshas* in *tya-chakshas\u0101*, which he renders *vy\u0101pta-dar\u015banau*; in *sahasra-chakshas*, an epithet of Varu\u1e47a, in vii. 34, 10, which he interprets by *bahu-chakshus*, \"many-eyed;\" and, optionally, in the compound *ghora-chak-*\nshase (vii. 104, 2), which he explains ghora-darsanadya parusha-\nbh\u0101shi\u1e47e v\u0101. S\u016brachakshas is rendered \u201csun-eyed\u201d by Benfey\nin i. 116, 4, also; though in his note he doubts whether this\nmeans, \u201cwith eyes gleaming like the sun,\u201d or \u201cwith eyes\nwhich see all, like the sun.\u201d To the compound uruchakshas,\nS\u0101ya\u1e47a gives the sense of \u201cseer of many,\u201d in i. 25, 5, and vii.\n51, 9; of \u201cgreat seers,\u201d in viii. 90, 2; of \u201cto be seen by\nmany,\u201d in i. 25, 16; but of \u201cpossessing great brilliancy,\u201d in\nvii. 35, 8; vii. 63, 4.\n\nCh\u0101ksha, in R.V. ii. 24, 9, is said by S\u0101ya\u1e47a to signify\nsarvasya drasht\u0101 sarva-saho v\u0101, either \u201call-seeing,\u201d or \u201call-\nenduring.\u201d\n\nJenya is explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a on R.V. i. 74, 4, as meaning\neither \u201cmanifested,\u201d or \u201cconquerors (of R\u0101kshasas).\u201d\n\nPasty\u0101, though generally rendered by S\u0101ya\u1e47a \u201cpeople,\u201d\n\u201cmen,\u201d house,\u201d \u201cdwellers in a house\u201d (i. 25, 10; i. 40, 7;\ni. 164, 30), has in one place (iv. 1, 11) the alternative sense\nof \u201criver\u201d assigned to it.\n\nIn R.V. i. 180, 7, the words vi pa\u00f1ir hitav\u0101n are said by\nS\u0101ya\u1e47a to mean either, \u201cthe vessel which receives the stipu-\nlated libation (?) has had the liquid put into it\u201d (pa\u00f1ih pan\u0101-\ndh\u0101ro drona-kalaso rihitac\u0101n sth\u0101pita-rasar\u0101n \u0101sit), or \u201clet the\ntrafficker, avaricious, unsacrificing, who, though possessed of\nwealth, does not sacrifice, be separated\u201d (pa\u00f1ir va\u1e47ik lubdhako\n'yasht\u0101 hitav\u0101nniyata-dhan\u0101dhyo'py ayasht\u0101 vi yujyat\u0101m).\nThe difference between these two explanations is evidently\nprodigious, and shows how greatly the Scholiast was at a loss.\nCompare Wilson\u2019s note in loco.\n\nU\u1e6dayah, generally rendered \u201caids,\u201d is in i. 84, 20, explained\nby S\u0101ya\u1e47a as = gantdrah \u201cgoers,\u201d or as standing (with the\nloss of the initial dh) for dh\u016btayah, \u201cshakers,\u201d meaning the\nMaruts. He also assigns to r\u0101dh\u0101msi in the same verse the\nunusual sense of \u201cspirits\u201d (bh\u016bt\u0101mi). He seems to have re-\ngarded these strange interpretations as necessitated by the\nfollowing verb dabhan, which has commonly the sense of \u201cin-\njure,\u201d \u201cdestroy.\u201d But it may have here, as Roth proposes,\ns.v., the signification of \u201cfail.\u201d\n\nDh\u1e5bta-vrata is an epithet often applied to the gods, chiefly\nto Mitra, Varu\u1e47a, and the \u0100dityas. It means, \u201cone whose ordinance stands fast,\u201d \u201cone by whom the order of nature is upheld,\u201d according to Roth, s.v., and M\u00fcller, \u201cAnc.Sansk.Lit.\u201d p.534. S\u0101ya\u1e47a on R.V. i. 15, 6, renders it by s\u1e5btk\u1e5bta-karm\u0101\u1e47au, \u201cthose by whom works are accepted;\u201d or, as Wilson translates, \u201cpropitious to pious acts.\u201d In i. 25, 8, also, S\u0101ya\u1e47a explains the word s\u1e5btk\u1e5bta-karma-vi\u1e63e\u1e63ha\u1e25, \u201che by whom a particular work is accepted;\u201d whereas M\u00fcller (p. 536) makes it, \u201cthe upholder of order.\u201d In v. 1 of the same hymn the word vrata (with which dh\u1e5bta-vrata is compounded) is vaguely rendered by S\u0101ya\u1e47a as = karma, \u201cwork;\u201d and Wilson translates the phrase vrata\u1e43 pramintmasi (which S\u0101ya\u1e47a explains as = karma pramaddena himsitavantah), by \u201cwe disfigure thy worship by imperfections.\u201d M\u00fcller renders it, probably more accurately, \u201cbreak thy laws.\u201d It is not clear which of the senses S\u0101ya\u1e47a adopted; for in other passages, where there can be no doubt that the sense is what M\u00fcller makes it, S\u0101ya\u1e47a uses the same terms of explanation. This is the case in ii. 38, 7, and v. 69, 4, where it is declared that no one can, or that the other gods cannot, hinder the ordinances of Savitri, or of Mitra and Varu\u1e47a, in which passages it is far more likely that \u201cdecrees\u201d or \u201cdesigns,\u201d than \u201cceremonies,\u201d are contemplated. In ii. 28, 8, where it is said that the ordinances of Varu\u1e47a rest unshaken on him as on a mountain, S\u0101ya\u1e47a explains vrat\u0101ni by karm\u0101\u1e47i vidhara\u1e47\u0101ni, \u201cworks,\u201d \u201cupholdings.\u201d And in ii. 38, 2, 9, he interprets the word of the \u201ccreative or impulsive act,\u201d prasav\u0101khyam karma, of Savitri. So, too, in i. 101, 3, he gives it the signification of niyama-r\u016bpe karma\u1e47i, niyamanam \u201ccontrolling act,\u201d \u201ccontroul;\u201d in iii. 30, 4, of karmane, \u0101j\u00f1\u0101yai, \u201ccommand;\u201d and in vii. 31, 11, of rak\u1e63an\u0101dini karm\u0101\u1e47i, \u201cpreservation and other works.\u201d But there are other passages in which he undoubtedly explains vrata by \u201crite,\u201d in accordance with the modern use of the word; as in i. 69, 4, where he takes it for et\u0101ni parid\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dyam\u0101n\u0101ni dar\u015ba-p\u016br\u1e47am\u0101s\u0101, \u201cthese rites which we see, the dar\u015ba, p\u016br\u1e47am\u0101s\u0101,\u201d etc.; and in i. 91, 3, where he takes it alternatively for sarv\u0101ny agni\u1e63\u1e6dom\u0101dini karm\u0101\u1e47i, \u201call the ceremonies, the\n\n1 On iv. 53, 4, he makes it = dh\u1e5btakarm\u0101, \u201che by whom work is upheld.\u201d\nagnish\u1e6doma,\u201d etc., or karm\u0101\u1e47i lokahitak\u0101r\u1e47i, \u201cacts promotive of the good of the world;\u201d whilst in v. 63, 7, where Mitra and Varuna are said to uphold ordinances by their support, \u201cthrough the wisdom of the divine Spirit,\u201d (dharm\u0101\u1e47a vrat\u0101 rak\u1e63e\u1e25te asurasya m\u0101yay\u0101), he explains these words by jagad-dh\u0101rakena v\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dhy-\u1e0ddi-lak\u1e63a\u1e47ena karman\u0101 vrat\u0101 yajn\u0101di-karm\u0101\u1e47i rak\u1e63e-\nthe p\u0101layath\u0101\u1e25, \u201cye support sacrifice and other rites by your world-sustaining action in the form of rain,\u201d etc. He interprets the word vrat\u0101 in a similar manner in the following texts: i. 92, 12; i. 124, 2; ii. 28, 2; vii. 47, 3; vii. 76, 5. In most, at least, of these passages, however, there is little doubt the word vrat\u0101 means \u201cordinances,\u201d or \u201claws.\u201d If there could be any question as to its having this meaning elsewhere, the point would be settled by R.V. x. 33, 9, na dev\u0101n\u0101m ati vratam \u015bat\u0101tm\u0101 chana j\u012bcati, \u201ceven the man of a hundred years does not live beyond the ordinance of (the term ordained by) the gods.\u201d \u00b9 Avrata probably means quite as much \u201clawless,\u201d as \u201cdestitute of rites.\u201d (See Roth\u2019s Lexicon, s.v.) In x. 2, 4, where it is said that Agni rectifies whatever transgressions of the ordinances (rrat\u0101ni) of the gods may be committed by the worshippers, the word probably alludes to sacred rites.\n\nRanva in R.V. ii. 24, 11, means, S\u0101ya\u1e47a tells us, ramayit\u0101 stotaryo rd, either \u201ca giver of pleasure,\u201d or \u201cone who is to be praised.\u201d\n\nR\u0101ti in R.V. i. 60, 1, is a word about which S\u0101ya\u1e47a is uncertain. He first explains it as \u201cfriend,\u201d a sense which he supports by the authority of Kapardin (whoever he may be), and then adds, \u201csome say r\u0101ti means \u201cson,\u201d and in proof of this he quotes R.V. iii. 2. 4. But when we turn to that passage we find, strangely enough, that he renders the word by abhilashit\u0101rtha-prad\u0101t\u0101ram, \u201cgiver of desired objects.\u201d\n\nRudravarttani, hir\u1e47yavarttani are epithets frequently applied to the gods, but diversely interpreted by S\u0101ya\u1e47a. He explains the former in R.V. i. 3, 3, as meaning \u201cleading in\n\n\u00b9 Compare R.V. viii. 28, 4, where a similar idea is expressed without the employment of the word vrat\u0101: Tath\u0101 va\u1e63anti dev\u0101s tath\u0101 id \u0101nat tad ca h\u0101m n\u0101k\u1e63a\u015b minat, etc., \u201cAs the gods wish, so it comes to pass; no one hinders that [will] of theirs,\u201d etc.\nthe front of the battle like heroes, who make their enemies weep.\u201d On viii. 22, 1, and 14, he renders it \u201cthose who in battle pursue a path characterized by weeping, or those whose path is praised.\u201d Hiranyakarttani in viii. 5, 11, he translates \u201cthey whose path is golden, or whose car is golden, or whose conduct is beneficent and pleasant\u201d (hita-ramanatydcharanau. On vii. 8, 1, he confines himself to the two latter senses. In vi. 61, 7, he makes it \u201chaving a golden chariot,\u201d and in viii. 26, 18, \u201chaving a golden path.\u201d Compare krshnavarttani and ghrtavarttani.\n\nStrbhih is a word which S\u0101ya\u1e47a translates by \u201cstars\u201d (nakshatrai\u1e25) in i. 68, 5; iv. 7, 3; vi. 49, 3, 12. Compare x. 68, 11. It is also found in ix. 63, 4, but I am not aware how he renders it there. Y\u0101ska explains the word in the same way, referring to one of these passages, iv. 7, 3, in illustration. In i. 87, 1, however, where it occurs in the following connection, anjibhir vy\u0101najre kechid usr\u0101 iva strbhih, S\u0101ya\u1e47a explains it by sva\u015bartrasy\u0101chhaddakai\u1e25, \u201ccovering their bodies,\u201d a sense, which I suppose to be a purely conjectural one, based only on etymology. He separates it from its more immediate context and makes it an epithet of anjibhi\u1e25, rendering the clause thus: \u201cThe Maruts are seen distinct in the sky through the ornaments covering their bodies, like any rays of the sun shining in the sky.\u201d The position of strbhih after usr\u0101\u1e25 is, however, rather adverse to this construction and rendering; and makes Roth\u2019s translation more probable, viz., \u201clike many oxen with stars, i.e. white spots.\u201d See s. v. usra. Benfey translates differently, but retains the sense \u201cstars,\u201d and thinks spots on the forehead may be meant. See Orient und Occident, ii. 250.\n\nSahasramushka is translated by S\u0101ya\u1e47a on R.V. vi. 46, 3, (= S\u0101ma-veda i. 286) as equivalent to sahasrasepha, \u201cmille membra genitalia habens;\u201d and a story illustrative of Indra\u2019s lasciviousness is adduced from the Kaushitakins to support this sense. In viii. 19, 32 the word is applied to Agni, and there S\u0101ya\u1e47a renders it bahutejaskam \u201chaving many flames,\u201d mushka being considered as = tejas, from its stealing away, or removing darkness.\n\u015aundhyu in R.V. i. 124, 4 is understood by Y\u0101ska (iv. 16) of the \"sun,\" or of a \"white water-fowl.\" S\u0101ya\u1e47a repeats the same optional interpretation.\n\nSvar\u0101j, as an epithet of Indra, is differently explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a in R.V. i. 61, 9; iii. 46, 1; vii. 82, 2; and viii. 12, 14. In iii. 46, 1, he makes it = dhan\u0101dhipati, \"lord of wealth,\" (sta here standing for \"property\"), and in the other places = stena\u00efra tejas\u0101 r\u0101jam\u0101nah, \"shining by his own lustre,\" or svayam era anya-nirapek\u1e63hayaira r\u0101jam\u0101nah, \"shining of himself, without reference to any one else,\" etc. In ii. 28, 1, where it is an epithet of Varu\u1e47a, it is said by S\u0101ya\u1e47a to mean \"shining of himself,\" or \"lord.\"\n\nSaksha\u1e47i is differently explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a in R.V. i. 111, 3, and in ii. 31, 4. In the former place it is said to mean \"overcoming\" (asm\u0101n abh\u012bbh\u0101vantam), whilst in the latter it is rendered, \"to be served or reverenced\" (sachanty\u0101\u1e25 sery\u0101\u1e25). In viii. 22, 15, also, it is similarly interpreted sachantya-\u015bilau. The word is also found in R.V. ix. 71, 4, and ix. 110, 1, but I have no access to the commentary on these two passages. The latter is, however, repeated in the \u015a\u0101ma-veda, i. 428, where Prof. Benfey renders the word \"taming (enemies).\" The sense of \"overcoming\" or \"controlling\" seems generally suitable in these passages. The word is, I presume, to be derived from the root sah, not from sach.\n\nR.V. i. 140, 9. The word tuvigrebhi\u1e25, an epithet of Agni's attendants (satvahibhi\u1e25) is explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a to mean either prabh\u016btam \u015babd\u0101yadbhi\u1e25, \"much-sounding,\" or prabh\u016bta-gamanai\u1e25, \"much-going.\" The apparently kindred word turigraye, R.V. ii. 21, 2 (an epithet, in the dative, of Indra) is said by him to mean either p\u016br\u1e47a-gr\u012br\u0101ya, \"with full neck,\" or bahubhi\u1e25 stotavy\u0101ya, \"to be praised by many.\"\n\nV\u1e5btanchaya, an epithet of Indra in R.V. ii. 21, 3, is declared by S\u0101ya\u1e47a to mean either abhish\u1e6dasy\u0101chet\u0101 sanchet\u0101 d\u0101t\u0101, \"the bestower of what is desired,\" or (\u1e5bt satru\u1e25, tam chayate hinasti iti v\u1e5btanchay\u0101\u1e25, a \"destroyer of enemies.\" Radhrachoda, in the following verse, is asserted to signify samuddh\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 prerakah yad\u0101 himsak\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 satr\u016bn\u0101\u1e41 chodakah, either \"a promoter of the affluent, or a driver of enemies.\"\nVar\u00fatrt appears to be explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a in i. 22, 10, as an epithet (varan\u012bya, \u201cto be desired\u201d), of Dhishan\u0101, the goddess of speech. In vii. 38, 5, and vii. 40, 6, however, the word is treated as a proper name, denoting the goddess of speech, V\u0101g-d\u0113rt or Sarasvat\u012b. In V\u0101j. S. xi. 61, we have the word in the plural, Var\u00fatrth, where Mahidhara says they are \u201cgoddesses personifying day and night\u201d (Var\u00fatrayo deryo \u2019hor\u0101tr\u0101bhim\u0101ninayah . . . \u201cahor\u0101tr\u0101ni vai var\u016btrayah | ahor\u0101trair hi idam sarvam rytam\u201d iti (S. P. Br. 6, 5, 4, 6). In R.V. i. 22, 11, the epithet achhinnapatra is applied to the wives of the gods, and signifies, according to S\u0101ya\u1e47a, \u201cwith wings uncut.\u201d For, he adds, \u201cthe wings of the wives of the gods, who have a winged form, are not cut by any one.\u201d Mahidhara on V\u0101j. S. xi. 61, explains the term somewhat differently, as \u201cthose whose course or flight is not cut or hindered, constantly going,\u201d achhinnam patram patanam y\u0101s\u0101m t\u0101\u1e25 satatay\u0101yinyah.\n\nVih\u0101yas means, in modern Sanskrit, \u201csky,\u201d \u201cbird.\u201d In the Nigha\u1e47\u1e6dus 3, 3, it is given as one of the synonymes of mahat, \u201cgreat.\u201d In Nir. iv. 15 (where Y\u0101ska quotes and interprets R.V. ix. 75, 5) it is said, as an epithet of mad\u0101\u1e25, \u201cintoxicating draughts,\u201d to signify vanchanavantah, \u201cdeceiving, deluding.\u201d The word occurs again as an epithet of Vi\u1e63vakarman in R.V. x. 72, 2 (= V\u0101j. S. 17, 26); and in Nir. x. 26, where that verse is explained, it is rendered by ry\u0101pt\u0101, \u201cpervader.\u201d Mahidhara interprets it as meaning either, \u201cpervading like the ether,\u201d or \u201cone who especially forsakes, a destroyer,\u201d nabho-rad ry\u0101pako yadr\u0101 vi\u1e63e\u1e63he\u1e47a jah\u0101ti tyajati vih\u0101y\u0101\u1e25 sanhart\u0101. Vih\u0101yas is also found as an epithet of Indra in R.V. iii. 36, 2, where S\u0101ya\u1e47a, after stating that its constituent elements mean \u201cthe giver of the desired objects to suppliants,\u201d ends by assigning to it the simple sense of \u201cgreat\u201d (vijah\u0101ty u\u1e63rjaty arth\u0101n arthibhya iti vih\u0101y\u0101 mah\u0101n. In iv. 11, 4, without entering into any explanation, he ascribes to it the same meaning. In his above cited comment on R.V. x. 72, 2 (Nir. x. 26), Y\u0101ska proposes no less than five different renderings for the participle \u012b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101ni, viz., k\u0101nt\u0101ni, kr\u0101nt\u0101ni, gat\u0101ni, mat\u0101ni, and nat\u0101ni.\nVishitashtuk\u0101, an epithet of Rodasi (\"the wife of the Maruts, or lightning,\" Marutpatnt vidyud r\u0101) in R.V. i. 167, 5, is said by S\u0101yana to mean either \"having a distinguished mass of hair,\" or \"having a dishevelled mass of hair\" (visi\u1e63\u1e6da-ke\u1e63a-sangh\u0101 viprak\u1e5b\u1e47\u1e47a-ke\u1e63a-sangh\u0101 r\u0101). Compare the different senses assigned to the word prthu\u1e63htuka, above.\n\nMesha occurs in the R.V. as a designation of Indra. On i. 51, 1 (=S.V. i. 376) S\u0101yana renders it \"striving with enemies, or ram, because Indra had come in that form to the rishi Medh\u0101tithi when sacrificing, and drunk his soma,\" etc. On i. 52, 1 (=S.V. i. 377) the Scholiast only mentions the first of these two senses; but on viii. 86, 12, he returns to the second and gives it as the exclusive meaning. He here, however, says that Indra, in the form of a ram, carried Medh\u0101tithi to heaven. In fact, there is a verse of the R.V. viii. 2, 40, which says, itth\u0101 dhvantam adricah Ka\u1e47\u1e47am Medhy\u0101tithim | mesho bh\u016bto 'bhi yann ayah | \"Thus, thunderer, having become a ram, and approaching the devout Medhy\u0101tithi of the race of Ka\u1e47\u1e47a, thou didst carry him away, (or, thou didst depart).\" S\u0101yana gives to the verb ayah here the causal sense of agamayah. Compare the words of i. 51, 13, men\u0101 abharo V\u1e5b\u1e63hanasvasya, which either arose out of, or gave rise to, another story about Indra.\n\nVartmabh\u012b\u1e25, in R.V. i. 55, 2, is rendered by S\u0101yana either \"coverings, or vastnesses,\" samcaranair yad\u0113d urutrai\u1e25.\n\nIn regard to ubhay\u0101sah, in R.V. i. 60, 2, it is left doubtful by S\u0101yana, whether it means both gods and men, or priests and those for whom they officiated.\n\nVar\u0101ha is given in Nigh. i. 10, as one of the names for \"cloud.\" In Nir. v. 4, two senses, \"cloud\" and \"boar,\" are assigned to it, R.V. i. 61, 7 being quoted as a passage where it has the former meaning. S\u0101yana, in loco, understands it either of \"cloud\" or \"sacrifice.\" See Wilson's note.\n\nThe notes to the fourth volume of Prof. Wilson's translation of the Rig-veda (verified by reference to the original Commentary), and an examination of parts of the volume itself, supply the following additional instances of double renderings by S\u0101yana, or of variations in interpretation be-\nbetween him and Mahidhara, the commentator on the Vajasaneyi Sanhita:\n\nR.V. vi. 62, 8. Rakshoyujo is explained by Saya\u00f1a as \"lord or instigator of Rakshases, or priest united with Rakshases;\"\nibid. 10. Nrvat\u00e2 rathena, as \"chariot with a charioteer, or with horses;\"\nvi. 63, 8. Dhenum isham, as \"gladdening food, or desirable cow.\"\nvi. 71, 3. Hiranyajihva, \"golden-tongued\" (so rendered by Wilson), is explained by Saya\u00f1a as \"having a kind, pleasant voice,\" though in the next verse he translates hiranyakap\u00e2ni, \"golden-handed.\"\n\nIn vi. 75, 11 (=V\u00e2j. S. xxix. 48) the tooth of an arrow is said to be mrga, which Saya\u00f1a (following Y\u00e2ska, ix. 19) understands either as meaning that it is made of \"deer's horn,\" or that it \"searches out the enemy.\" Mahidhara adheres to the latter sense.\n\nOn vi. 75, 13 (=V\u00e2j. S. xxix. 50), I quote Prof. Wilson's note, from which it will be seen that the interpreters are at variance: \"Prachetasah is applied by Y\u00e2ska, ix. 20, and Mahidhara, to \u00e2sv\u00e2n, the intelligent horses; but Saya\u00f1a is better advised, as there is no other nominative to the verbs janghanti and jighnate.\" I think, however, that from the position of prachetasah in the verse it is difficult to connect it in the way Saya\u00f1a does.\n\nvii. 3, 7. Purbhih is here rendered \"cities,\" but \"protectors\" (p\u00e2lakaih) in vi. 48, 8, where it occurs in a similar connection. It probably means \"rampart,\" as in fact Saya\u00f1a himself intimates on vii. 15, 14; Puh purt tad-rakh\u00e2sadhana-bh\u00fbta-pr\u00e2k\u00e2r- (qu. pr\u00e2k\u00e2r-) \u00e2dir v\u00e2, \"Pur is a city, or walls, etc., which are the means of its defence.\"\n\nvii. 4, 7. Parishadyam is translated either as \"fit\" (pary\u00e2ptam), or \"to be taken away\" (pariharttavyam); and arana, here rendered \"freedom from debt,\" is in verse 8 explained as aramam\u00e2n, \"not delighting.\"\n\nvii. 5, 3. Puru, here and in vi. 46, 8, explained as the \"name of a king,\" is in vii. 8, 4, interpreted as the \"name\nof an Asura;\"\u00b9 and in i. 63, 7, as an epithet of Sud\u0101s, in the sense of, \"satisfying with offerings.\" In iv. 21, 10, where the context is partly the same as in i. 63, 7, p\u016bru is explained \"man,\" \"sacrificer.\" In i. 130, 7, after saying that p\u016bru signifies \"one who fills up, offers, what is desired,\" S\u0101yana ends by telling us that the word is one of the names for \"man.\"\n\nibid. 7. V\u0101yur na p\u0101tha\u1e25 parip\u0101si is explained as, \"thou drinkest soma like V\u0101yu,\" or \"thou drinkest up, driest, water like V\u0101yu.\"\u00b2\n\nvii. 6, 4. The subject of the participle madant\u012b\u1e25 is said to be either \"creatures\" (praj\u0101\u1e25), or \"dawns\" (ushas\u0101\u1e25).\n\nvii. 8, 4 (=V\u0101j. S. xii. 34). \u015ar\u012bve is rendered by S\u0101yana, \"is renowned,\" whilst Mah\u012bdhara makes it, \"hears the invocation of the worshipper.\"\n\nibid. 6. Dvibarh\u0101\u1e25 is explained as \"great in knowledge and works,\" or \"great in two worlds.\"\n\nvii. 16, 1 (=V\u0101j. S. xv. 32). Arati is explained by S\u0101yana as goer\" or \"lord;\" by Mah\u012bdhara as \"having competent understanding,\" or \"of ceaseless activity.\"\n\nibid. 7 (=V\u0101j. S. xxxiii. 14.) Yant\u0101ra\u1e25 is rendered by S\u0101yana \"givers,\" and by Mah\u012bdhara, \"controlling their senses.\" S\u0101yana assigns to sur\u0101ya\u1e25 in the same verse the sense of \"impellers,\" or of \"praisers.\"\n\nvii. 18, 6. Maty\u0101do ni\u1e63it\u0101\u1e25 is rendered either \"like fish confined,\" or \"Matayas (people so called) harassed;\" and \u015brushti, either \"quick arrival,\" or \"happiness,\" while in v. 10 it receives the former sense, and in vii. 40, 1 the latter.\n\nibid. 8. Bheda is explained either \"unbeliever\" (n\u0101stika), or as the name of an enemy of Sud\u0101s (which latter sense is also assigned in vii. 33, 3).\n\nvii. 23, 4 (=V\u0101j. S. xxxiii. 18), \u0100pa\u015b chit pipuy\u0101\u1e25 staryo na g\u0101va\u1e25: S\u0101yana: \"Let the waters increase like barren\n\n\u00b9 So, too, Mah\u012bdhara on V\u0101j. S. xii. 34.\n\u00b2 Both explanations seem to be wrong. Compare the words Vi\u1e63\u1e47uryog\u0101\u1e25 paramom p\u0101ti p\u0101tha\u1e25, in iii. 55, 10, where S\u0101yana himself renders the last three words \"guards the highest place;\" though he adds an optional rendering of p\u0101tha\u1e25 as the \"place of water, the atmosphere.\"\ncows.\" Mahidhara: \"The waters swell the soma like the Vedic texts, with which libations are offered.\"\n\nvii. 32, 18 (= S.V. i. 310), compared with viii. 19, 26. In the former passage, the words na p\u0101patv\u0101ya r\u0101sty\u0101, which are common to both, are explained by na dady\u0101m: \"I would not give, i.e. I would not give up, my worshipper to wretchedness.\" (Comp. M\u00fcller's transl. of this verse, in his Anc. Sansk. Lit. p. 545. In viii. 1, 22, r\u0101sate is explained by dad\u0101ti: \"he gives.\") In viii. 19, 26, however, the same words, na r\u0101sty\u0101, though employed in a similar connection, are explained by na \u0101kro\u1e63ayam: \"I would not cause thee to be reviled.\" Prof. Wilson there translates as follows: \"May I not be accused, Vasu, of calumniating thee, nor, gracious (Agni), of sinfulness against thee,\" etc.: instead of which Mr. Cowell proposes to render: \"Let me not abuse thee by calumny or wickedness,\" which is no material improvement. There can be little doubt, I think, that S\u0101ya\u1e47a, followed by his translators, is wrong, and that the verse should be taken in conjunction with the preceding (v. 25) and (omitting epithets) be explained as follows: \"If, Agni, thou wert a mortal, and I an immortal, I should not give thee up to execration, or to wretchedness,\" etc.\u00b9 We have S\u0101ya\u1e47a's own authority on vii. 32, 18, as I have shown, for rendering na r\u0101sty\u0101: \"I would not give;\" and although he does not explain p\u0101patv\u0101ya at all in either of these passages, he does distinctly assign to it the sense of \"wretchedness\" (hinabh\u0101rv\u0101ya) in a similar text, vii. 94, 3: \"Do not, ye heroes, Indra and Agni, subject us to wretchedness (p\u0101patv\u0101ya), or to execration, or to reviling.\" Comp. Benfey's rendering of S\u0101ma-veda, i. 310, and ii. 268.\n\nvii. 41, 2 (= V\u0101j. S. xxxiv. 35.) Tura is rendered by S\u0101ya\u1e47a \"wealthy;\" by Mahidhara \"sick,\" or as a designation of \"Yama.\"\n\nvii. 48, 3. Uparat\u0101ti is explained here as = upalat\u0101ti, \"that which is carried on with stones, a battle.\" On i. 151, 5, it is explained as \"that which has an extension of clouds.\"\n\n\u00b9 There are other instances in the hymns of the sense running on from one verse into another. See vv. 5 and 6 of this same hymn, viii. 19, and viii. 12, 32 f. in Prof. Wilson's translation.\nvii. 64, 1. The words *gh\u1e5btasya nir\u1e47y\u0101\u1e25* are interpreted either \"forms of water\" discharged by the clouds, or \"forms of melted butter\" offered to Mitra and Varuna.\n\nvii. 66, 9. The verb *dhi\u1e41ahi* is interpreted here, \"we hold, or have;\" on iii. 62, 10 (the celebrated *g\u0101yatr\u012b*), \"we meditate\" (*dhy\u0101y\u0101ma\u1e25*), or \"let us hold in our mind as an object of contemplation\" (*dheyatay\u0101 manasa dharayema*), or \"we hold\" (*dh\u0101ray\u0101ma\u1e25*). In vii. 15, 7, *nidhi\u1e41ahi* is explained, \"we have placed;\" and in i. 17, 6, \"we deposit as a treasure.\"\n\nvii. 71, 4. *Visvapnya* is explained as \"pervading\" (*vy\u0101ptar\u016bpa*), or as a name of Vasishtha.\n\nvii. 77, 2. *Gavam m\u0101t\u0101* is said to mean the \"former, either of voices, or of cows.\"\n\nvii. 79, 3. *Angirastama*, an epithet of Ushas (the Dawn), is explained as either \"the quickest of goers,\" or as a designation given to her, because night was produced along with the Bharadvajas of the race of Angiras, and she (the Dawn) forms the end of the night!\n\nvii. 82, 1. *Mahi garma* is explained as either a \"great house, or \"great happiness.\"\n\nibid. 5. *Subham tyate* is explained either, \"obtains an ornament,\" or \"sends water.\"\n\nvii. 83, 2. *Svar\u0101\u015b* is here explained \"seeing heaven after quitting the body.\" In vii. 58, 2, it is interpreted, \"seer of the sun, i.e. living creature,\" or \"tree, from its seeing the sky.\"\n\nvii. 90, 1 (=V\u0101j. S. xxxiii. 70.) *V\u012bray\u0101* is taken by S\u0101ya\u1e47a for a dative masc. \"to the hero (V\u0101yu);\u201d whilst Mahidhara joins with it the preceding *pra* and makes *pr\u0101tray\u0101* an epithet of the soma libations, with the sense, \"having excellent heroes sprung from knowledge, priests.\"\n\nibid. 3 (=Vaj. S. xxvii. 24.) S\u0101ya\u1e47a takes *nireke* for \"in poverty,\" and Mahidhara for \"in a place crowded with people.\"\n\nibid. 5. *V\u012brav\u0101ham* is explained either to be \"borne by worshippers, or by horses.\"\n\nvii. 99, 3 (=Vaj. S.V. 16.) *May\u016bkhai\u1e25* is rendered by\nS\u0101yana \"mountains,\" while Mahidhara understands it of \"various glorious lives (sva-tejo-r\u016bpair n\u0101n\u0101 jivai\u1e25), or his numerous incarnations in a Boar,\" etc.\n\nvii. 104, 2. Ghorachakshas is explained as either \"horrible in aspect,\" or \"harshly speaking.\"\n\nviii. 1, 2. Ubbhay\u0101vinam is explained as either \"having both celestial and earthly riches,\" or \"having both stationary and moving things to preserve,\" or \"having persons both to praise and sacrifice to him.\"\n\nibid. 10. G\u0101yatravepas is explained here \"having approved speed,\" whilst on i. 142, 12, it is interpreted as \"having the form of the g\u0101yatra.\"\n\nIbid. 31. Y\u0101deha\u1e25 is explained as either \"of the race of Yadu,\" or \"renowned among men,\" and pasu as either \"having cattle,\" or \"a perceiver of what is minute.\"\n\nviii. 3, 5. Samtke is interpreted as either \"at sacrifice,\" or in battle.\"\n\nibid. 9. Yatibhyah is explained as either \"from non-sacrificing men,\" or \"for men practising rites.\"\n\nibid. 24. Turtya is explained either \"fourth,\" or a \"destroyer of enemies.\"\n\nviii. 4, 8. D\u0101na is interpreted either a \"breaker up,\" (avakhandayit\u0101) or a \"giver.\"\n\nviii. 5, 9. Vi pathah sitam is explained either \"shut up the paths that others may not enter,\" or the contrary, \"open up, show the paths.\"\n\nibid. 13. Brahma jan\u0101n\u0101m is interpreted as either \"the Br\u0101hman-caste among men,\" or \"the prayer, or the sacrificial food, of men.\"\n\nibid. 38. Charmamndhi is explained as either \"practised in the wearing of cuirasses of leather,\" or \"exercised in the use of horses and other instruments of motion.\" The word is interpreted by Mahidhara on Vaj. S. xxx. 15, as \"a person practised in the handling of leather (charm\u0101bhy\u0101sa-karam.)\"\n\nviii. 6, 3. J\u0101mi is interpreted as either \"useless,\" or \"kinsman,\" dyudham as either \"weapon,\" or \"assailant,\" and\n\n1 S\u0101yana adds, \"For mountains belong to Vishnu as his own, as the Veda says 'Vishnu is lord of the mountains.'\"\nkanr\u0101\u1e25 as either \"encomiasts,\" or \"persons of the family of Kanva.\"\n\nviii. 12, 1. Mada is explained as either the \"exhilaration\" of Indra, or \"to be exhilarated,\" or \"exhilarated.\"\n\nviii. 13, 1. The words kratum ukthyam are explained either \"the performer of the rite and the encomiast,\" or the \"sacrifice called ukthya.\"\n\nibid. 3. Bhar\u0101ya is explained either \"to the battle,\" or \"to the sacrifice,\" and it is added that the same words generally denote both these things.\n\nviii. 15, 2. The word ajr\u00e1n is taken as an epithet of the preceding term girtn, \"mountains or clouds,\" and explained as \"quickly moving.\" It is diversely interpreted in other passages. On viii. 27, 18, it is made to signify the \"city of the enemy, although impregnable against the assaults of others,\" or \"level ground;\" on iv. 1, 17, \"the undecaying, mountains,\" or \"the moving, rays;\" on iv. 19, 7, \"travelling on the road;\" on v. 54, 4, \"clouds.\" I do not know how S\u0101yana renders it in x. 44, 8, and x. 59, 3. Prof. Roth renders it \"ager, field,\" and Prof. Goldst\u00fccker, \"field, acre, plain,\" and also as an adjective, \"quick.\" The sense of \"plains\" is fixed by the context of x. 59, 3, as, at least, one of the right ones: \"Let us by our manly deeds overcome our enemy, as the sky (is over) the earth, and the mountains (over) the plains\" (girayo na ajr\u00e1n).\n\nviii. 17, 5. Kukshyo\u1e25 is interpreted either, in Indra's \"two bellies; (as it is written 'fill both bellies, that of the slayer of V\u1e5btra, and that of Maghavat')\" or \"the right and left sides, or the upper and lower parts, of a single belly.\"\n\nIbid. 12. \u015a\u0101chigu is explained as either \"he who has strong cows,\" or \"he who has manifest, famous, rays, or cows.\"\n\nibid. 13. \u015arngav\u1e5bsho nap\u0101t is explained as either \"the son of \u015aringav\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d,\" or \u015brngav\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d is \"the showerer of rays, the sun,\" and nap\u0101t \"he who causes not to fall, who establishes,\" and therefore the two words together mean \"the establisher of the sun.\"\n\nibid. 15. Pr\u1e0d\u0101kus\u0101nu is explained as either \"having the\nhead erect like a serpent,\u201d or \u201cto be propitiated like a serpent.\u201d\n\nviii. 18, 21. Trivar\u016b\u1e6dha is explained as either \u201caffording protection from three inconveniences\u2014cold, heat, and rain,\u201d or \u201chaving three stories.\u201d\n\nThe following are some additional instances of the same description, chiefly from the earlier books of the Rig-veda.\n\ni. 31, 2, and i. 112, 4. Dvim\u0101\u1e6d\u0101, an epithet of Agni, is explained by S\u0101yana as either \u201cborn from two pieces of wood,\u201d i.e. by friction, and so having two parents, or \u201cmaker of the two worlds.\u201d Compare dvijanm\u0101 in i. 140, 2, and i. 149, 4, which, in the former place, he interprets either \u201cborn from two pieces of wood,\u201d or by \u201cfriction and the subsequent rite of consecration;\u201d while in the second passage a third sense of \u201cborn from heaven and earth,\u201d is added. In i. 112, 4, the verb vibh\u016bshati is rendered either \u201cpervades,\u201d or \u201cadorns.\u201d So, also, paribh\u016bshathah in iii. 12, 9, is declared to mean either \u201cye are adorned\u201d (alank\u1e5btau bhavathah), or, \u201cye overcome\u201d (paribhavathah). See, above, the different senses assigned by Y\u0101ska to paryabh\u016bshat.\n\ni. 64, 10. V\u1e5bsha-kh\u0101dayah, an epithet of the Maruts, is explained as either, \u201chaving Indra for their weapon,\u201d or \u201chaving soma for their beverage.\u201d The word is rendered \u201cadorned with ear-rings,\u201d by Bollensen (in Benfey\u2019s Orient und Occident, ii. 461, note), who refers for the meaning he assigns to v\u1e5bsha to Wilson\u2019s Dictionary, s.v., v\u1e5bshabha, where one of the senses given is, \u201cthe orifice of the ear.\u201d Khaddi occurs frequently in the R.V. in the sense of an ornament worn by the Maruts, as in v. 53, 4; v. 54, 11, where it is rendered by S\u0101yana ka\u1e6daka, and in vii. 56, 13, where he renders it alank\u0101ra-vis\u0113sha. On i. 168, 3, he makes it mean \u201ca guard to the hand,\u201d hastatr\u0101\u1e47aka, and on i. 166, 9, either \u201ceatables\u201d or \u201cornaments.\u201d In the last passage he takes prapatheshu either for \u201cresting-places,\u201d or \u201ctoes.\u201d Roth, s.v., conjectures that the proper reading here must be prapadeshu.\n\ni. 92, 10. \u015avagnti is here taken by S\u0101yana for the feminine of \u015bv\u0101ha (lit. dog-killer), and is rendered vy\u0101dha-str\u012b, a \u201chunter\u2019s wife.\u201d The word is, however, explained by Y\u0101ska\n(Nir. v. 22, where he quotes R.V. x. 43, 5) as = kitava, \u201ca gamester.\u201d This sense is adopted by S\u0101ya\u1e47a himself on viii. 45, 38. On ii. 12, 4, dropping all reference to any feminine sense, he explains the word as \u201chunter\u201d (vy\u0101dha), viz., \u201cone who kills wild animals with dogs\u201d (\u015bvabhir mrg\u0101n hanti); and in the same way on iv. 20, 3, as mrgayu, \u201ca hunter.\u201d See Benfey\u2019s note on i. 92, 10, in his version of the passage in his Orient und Occident, ii. 257; and Bollensen\u2019s translation of the verse in the same vol., p. 464. If Y\u0101ska is right in explaining \u015bvagnt as a masculine noun, signifying \u201cgamester,\u201d it can scarcely be also the feminine of \u015bvah\u0101; or if it be the latter, it cannot well have a masculine sense also. I observe, also, that S\u0101ya\u1e47a renders the word vij\u0101h \u201cbirds\u201d in i. 92, 10; and \u201cone who causes distress\u201d (udvejaka) in ii. 12, 5.\n\ni. 128, 4. Ish\u016byate is said to mean either \u201cto him who desires food,\u201d or \u201cto him who desires coming.\u201d\n\ni. 169, 5. The words tve r\u0101yas to\u1e63atamah are rendered either \u201cthy riches are most gladdening,\u201d or \u201cthy kinsmen, friends (the Maruts), are most destructive (to clouds which do not rain).\u201d\n\ni. 173, 6. Opa\u1e47a is here explained as either a \u201chorn,\u201d or \u201cearth and atmosphere.\u201d On viii. 14, 5, the scholiast makes it either \u201ca cloud lying near\u201d (megham upetya say\u0101nam), or \u201csome particular manly power contained in himself\u201d (i.e. in Indra, \u0101tm\u0101ni samaceto v\u012brya-vi\u1e63eshah.\n\ni. 190, 5. The words chayase piy\u0101rum are explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a as either, \u201cthou visitest, with the view of favouring, him who drinks, offers, soma,\u201d or \u201cthou destroyest the destructive man.\u201d The latter interpretation is supported by Nir. iv. 25, to which S\u0101ya\u1e47a refers; and is adopted by him in iii. 30, 8.\n\nii. 1, 4. Asura is explained here as either, \u201cthe expeller of foes\u201d (satr\u0101\u1e47\u0101m nirasit\u0101), or \u201cthe giver of strength, the sun.\u201d This word is very variously interpreted by S\u0101ya\u1e47a in different places. On i. 24, 14, he makes it = anishta-ka\u015bhepana-s\u012bla, \u201cthe hurler away of what is undesired;\u201d on i. 35, 7, sarvesh\u0101\u1e41 pr\u0101\u1e47ada, \u201cthe giver of life to all;\u201d on i. 54, 3, either, \u201cthe expeller of enemies,\u201d or \u201che who has breath, or force,\u201d\nor \"the giver of breath, or water;\" on i. 64, 2, and i. 174, 1, expellers of enemies;\" on i. 108, 6, \"thrower of oblations, priest;\" on i. 110, 3, an unexplained designation of Tvashtri, perhaps in the later sense of \"evil spirit;\" on i. 131, 1, \"expeller of unrighteous enemies;\" on i. 151, 4, \"strong;\" on ii. 27, 10, satr\u016b\u1e47\u1e0dam kshepaka, \"hurler away of enemies; on iv. 2, 5; iv. 53, 1; v. 12, 1; v. 15, 1; v. 27, 1; vii. 2, 3; vii. 6, 1; vii. 30, 3; vii. 36, 2, \"strong; on v. 42, 1, \"giver of breath;\" ibid. v. 11, \"strong,\" or \"giver of breath;\" on v. 51, 11, \"expeller of enemies, or giver of breath, or force;\" on v. 41, 3, \"taker away of breath\" (Rudra), or \"giver of breath\" (S\u00fbrya or V\u00e2yu); on iii. 3, 4 \"giver of strength;\" on iii. 29, 14, \"the impelling\" (arani-wood); on v. 63, 3, 7, \"the expeller (or discharger) of water, Parjanya;\" on v. 83, 6, the same sense; on vii. 56, 1, \"wise\" (praj\u00f1\u00e2d\u00e2n); on viii. 20, 17, \"a water-discharging cloud,\" or \"rain water;\" on viii. 25, 4, \"powerful,\" or \"as pervading all things, impellers;\" on viii. 79, 6, \"powerful, or possessor of life.\" In the Nighantus i. 10, asura is given as one of the synonymes of \"cloud.\" In Nir. iii. 8, it is said to be =asu-rata, \"devoted to breath,\" or to come from sth\u00e2nesu or sth\u00e2nebhyah asta, \"thrown in, or from, places;\" or asu is a synonyme of pr\u00e2na, \"life,\" a thing \"thrown into the body. The Asuras are they who have it.\" And he adds, \"it is well known that he (the creator) formed the Suras (gods) from su, \"good,\" in which their essence consists, and that he formed the Asuras from asu (or a + su, \"not good\"), and that in this consists their essence.\" It is to be observed that the verse here explained by Y\u00e2ska (R.V. x. 53, 4) is one of those later texts in which the word asura has the sense of evil spirit, as an enemy of the gods, a sense which it does not generally bear in the older hymns, in which it is a designation of the gods themselves. (In vii. 13, 1, however, Agni is called an \"Asura-slayer,\" as is also Indra in vii. 22, 4).\n\nii. 11, 21. M\u00e2 ati dhak is explained by S\u00e2yana either \"do not give to others, passing us by,\" or \"do not burn up our objects of desire.\"\n\nvi. 2, 7. Tray\u00e2yya is explained by S\u00e2yana as either, \"to be\npreserved,\u201d or \u201cone who has the three qualifications of science, austerity and works,\u201d or \u201cone who has attained to the three births.\u201d\u00b9\n\nviii. 24, 24. Paripad\u0101m is explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a as either \u201cpersons who are sacrificing around,\u201d or \u201cbirds which are flying around.\u201d\n\n\u015ar\u0101tra is given in Nigh. ii. 10, among the synonymes of dhana, \u201cwealth.\u201d In Nir. v. 3, it is said to mean \u201cquick\u201d (sv\u0101tram iti kshipra-n\u0101ma \u0101\u015bu atan\u0101m bhavati); and the words of R.V. x. 88, 4, sa patatritvaram sth\u0101 jagad yach chh\u0101dram Agnir ak\u1e5b\u1e47o j\u0101taved\u0101\u1e25 are explained: \u201cAgni J\u0101tavedas made quickly whatever flies, goes, stands or moves.\u201d The term is also found in R.V. i. 31, 4, where the clause sv\u0101tre\u1e47a yat pitror muchyase pari, spoken of Agni, is rendered by S\u0101ya\u1e47a: \u201cWhen thou art released from thy parents (the two pieces of wood) by rapid friction (sv\u0101tre\u1e47a),\u201d etc. In viii. 4, 9 (= S.V. i. 277), the word is found in the compound sv\u0101trabh\u0101j, an epithet of vayas (there stated to mean \u201cfood\u201d), and is declared to signify \u201cassociated with wealth.\u201d In viii. 52, 5, it occurs again in the phrase sv\u0101tram arka ant\u0101shata, which the Scholiast interprets, \u201cthe worshippers praise very quickly, very long.\u201d I am ignorant how he explains the word in x. 46, 7, where it occurs in the plural as an epithet of \u201cfires;\u201d but Mahidhara on V\u0101j. S. xxxiii. 1 (where the verse is repeated), assigns to it the sense of khipra-phalaprada, \u201cquickly bestowing rewards.\u201d In V\u0101j. S. iv. 12, and vi. 34, sv\u0101tra is found as an epithet of \u0101pah, \u201cwaters,\u201d and in the former of these verses (where \u201cwaters\u201d are said to stand for milk) it is explained \u201cquickly digested\u201d (kshipra-parin\u0101mdh stghram jir\u1e47\u0101\u1e25), whilst in the second the sense of \u201cquickly effecting the desired object,\u201d or \u201causpicious\u201d (kshipra-k\u0101rya-k\u0101rinyah \u015biv\u0101 r\u0101), is assigned. In V\u0101j. S. v. 31, sv\u0101tra is used in a sacrificial formula as an epithet of a particular sort of little altar called Maitracarun\u0101dhishnya, and is explained as signifying \u201cfriendly\u201d (mitrah). \u015av\u0101trya appears to be an epithet of Soma in R.V. x. 49, 10,\n\n\u00b9 In v. 11 of this hymn S\u0101ya\u1e47a explains the pronoun ta, \u201cthese,\u201d as meaning the \u201csins committed in another birth,\u201d\u2014a further instance of his ascribing more modern notions to the Vedic age.\nas it is of girah, \"hymns,\" in x. 160, 2; but I am not aware how it is explained in those passages by the Commentator. On the whole, looking to the variety of senses ascribed to the word \u015b\u0101dtra, and to the artificial processes by which those senses are sometimes reached, I cannot but think that the Scholiasts were not always sure of its real signification.\n\nI have, perhaps, already adduced a superabundance of instances in which S\u0101yana, or Y\u0101ska, gives double, and, therefore, uncertain, interpretations of obscure words in the Rigveda. But if any reader desires to pursue the subject further, he may examine for himself the following additional illustrations of the same fact which are indicated in the notes to the first three volumes of Prof. Wilson's translation of the Rigveda, and have been verified by a reference to the Commentary of S\u0101yana:\n\nR.V. i. 43, 4; i. 50, 4; i. 51, 4; i. 62, 4; i. 65, 3; i. 68, 1; i. 84, 16, 18; i. 89, 6; i. 95, 6; i. 97, 1; i. 100, 14; i. 102, 9; i. 105, 1, 8; i. 110, 6; i. 115, 1; i. 122, 2, 14; i. 123, 3; i. 124, 7; i. 125, 7; i. 127, 7; i. 129, 10; i. 130, 9; i. 132, 3; i. 141, 3; i. 143, 3; i. 145, 4; i. 146, 1; i. 149, 4; i. 150, 1 (comp.

S. vi. 5) he explains thus: \"The wise ever behold with scriptural gaze (\u015b\u0101stra-d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dya) that supreme station of Vishnu, as the eye extended on every side in the sky, clear from the absence of any obstacle, beholds.\" He thus makes chakshus, \"the eye,\" a nominative, and supplies pasyati, \"beholds.\" Mah\u012bdhara, however, taking chakshus as an accusative, renders, as it appears to me, correctly, \"like an eye extended in the clear sky,\" or (dropping the particle denoting resemblance) \"that eye, the orb of the sun, which is extended in the sky;\" and he quotes V\u0101j. S. vii. 42 (=R.V. i. 115, 1) and xxxvi. 24 (=R.V. vii. 66, 16) to show that the orb of the sun (represented here by Vishnu) is called an \"eye.\" Compare also R.V. vi. 51, 1; vii. 61, 1; vii. 63, 1; vii. 76, 1; x. 37, 1. \"The wise\" thus, according to Mah\u012bdhara, \"behold the highest station of Vishnu fixed in the sky, like an eye.\" This construction is also adopted by Benfey in his version of the hymn.\n\ni. 25, 11, is rendered by Wilson, following S\u0101yana, \"through him (ata\u1e25 = asm\u0101d Varun\u0101t), the sage (chikito\u1e0dan) beholds,\" etc.; but better by M\u00fcller (Anc. Sansk. Lit. p. 536), \"from thence perceiving (chikito\u1e0dan),\" etc., \"he (Varuna) sees,\" etc. Similarly Benfey.\n\nibid. v. 13. The words pari spa\u1e63o nishedire are explained by S\u0101yana: \"the gold-touching rays were diffused (nishan-\u1e47\u0101\u1e25, placed) on every side.\" M\u00fcller renders better: \"the spies sat down around him.\" So, too, Benfey. Compare A.V. iv. 16, 4, where there can be no doubt that the word spa\u1e63ah means \"messengers\" or \"spies.\" See also the remarks which I have made above on this term.\ni. 91, 3. The first words of this verse are rendered by Wilson, \"thy acts are (like those) of the royal Varuna,\" in conformity with the second of the two interpretations proposed by S\u0101ya\u1e47a. The first, which Wilson rejects, is as follows: \"Varuna is soma bought for sacrifice and covered with a cloth (vastrend\u0101rtah): all the ceremonies, the agnish\u1e6dhoma, etc., are connected with thee when purchased; hence thou art the instrument in all sacrifices.\"\n\nvii. 32, 18 (on which, as well as on the passage to be next quoted, viii. 19, 25 f., I have already made some remarks), is rendered as follows by Professor M\u00fcller (Anc. Sansk. Lit. p. 545:) \"If I were lord of as much as thou, I should support the sacred bard, thou scatterer of wealth, I should not abandon him to misery. 19. I should award wealth day by day to him who magnifies; I should award it to whosoever it be. We have no other friend but thee,\" etc. But S\u0101ya\u1e47a understands the first clause of v. 19, not as a continuation of the words of the worshipper, as it appears to be, but as spoken by Indra: \"Having heard these words of Indra,\" he says, \"the rishi, delighted, exclaims, 'we have no other friend,'\" etc. This appears to be wrong.\n\nviii. 19, 25 f. is a passage closely resembling the preceding. It begins thus: Yad Agne martyas tvam sy\u0101m aham mitramah\u014d amartyah, and should, I think, be translated as follows: \"If, Agni, thou (wert) a mortal, (and) were I, o amicably-shining god, an immortal, o invoked son of strength,\u2014(26) I would not abandon thee to malediction, or to poverty; my worshipper should not be poor or distressed,\" etc. Verse 25 would thus form the protasis and verse 26 the apodosis. But S\u0101ya\u1e47a takes the 25th verse by itself and explains it thus: \"If I, a mortal, were thou, i.e. if I should, by worshipping thee, acquire thy nature, then I should become an immortal, a god.\" My interpretation is borne out by a parallel passage (which is not, like the preceding, elliptical in construction), viii. 44, 28. Yad Agne sy\u0101m aham tvam tr\u0101m v\u0101 gha sy\u0101 aham | syus te saty\u0101 ih\u0101\u015bishah, which S\u0101ya\u1e47a renders, \"If I were thou,\n\n1 I adopt here S\u0101ya\u1e47a's rendering of mitramah\u014ds, whether it be correct or not.\n(wealthy), or thou wert I (a poor worshipper), then thy wishes would be fulfilled.\u201d Compare also viii. 14, 1, 2.\n\nIt is true R.V. i. 38, 4, 5, may be quoted on the other side. The original of this passage is as follows: 4. Yad y\u00fayam pr\u015bnim\u0101tara\u1e25 mart\u0101sah sy\u0101tana | stot\u0101 vo amrtah sy\u0101t. | 5. M\u0101 vo mrgo na yavase jari\u1e6d\u0101 bh\u016bd ajoshyah | path\u0101 yamasya gadd upa | which S\u0101yana renders: \u201cAlthough you, sons of Prisni, were mortals, yet your worshipper would be immortal, a god. (Prof. Wilson\u2019s version of this verse does not correctly represent S\u0101yana). 5. Let not your panegyrist be an object of disregard (as a wild animal is not regardless of grass in a pasture), or go along the path of Yama.\u201d Rosen renders: \u201c4. Licet vos, Prisnis filii! mortales fueritis, tamen laudator vester immortalis esse poterit. 5. Nunquam vester laudator, cervi instar in prato, sit negligendus, neque Yam\u00e6 viam calcet.\u201d Benfey translates: \u201c4. If you, o children of Prisni, were mortals, an immortal would then be your panegyrist. 5. Let not him who praises you be an object of indifference to you, like a wild animal at grass; let him not walk along the path of Yama.\u201d And he gives the following paraphrase of v. 4: \u201cYe are so great, that if ye were men, the gods would sing your praises.\u201d Professor Aufrecht would render: \u201cEven if ye were mortals (and not gods, as you are in reality), it would require an immortal to praise you (worthily).\u201d I cannot say that these interpretations appear to me particularly satisfactory. If we could suppose an apopoeisis at the end of v. 4, the sense might be: \u201cIf ye were mortals, and your worshipper an immortal, i.e. if you and I were to change places, I would not be so careless about my worshippers as you are about yours.\u201d Or can we suppose that the Rishi is expressing an aspiration that he could change places with the objects of his adoration? Or, possibly, the meaning might be: \u201cIf ye were mortal [i.e. if ye knew by experience the sufferings of mortality], your worshipper should be [ye would make him] immortal.\u201d This perhaps derives some confirmation from the deprecation of death in the next verse.\n\nvii. 89, 1, is thus explained by S\u0101yana: \u201cLet me not go, o\nking Varuna, to thy earthen house; but may I attain to thy resplendent golden house.\" The sense seems simply to be what M\u00fcller makes it: \"Let me not yet, o Varuna, enter into the house of clay,\" i.e. the grave. Compare A.V. v. 30, 14, m\u0101 nu g\u0101d m\u0101 nu bh\u016bmigrho bhuvat, \"let him not go; let him not have the earth for his house.\"\n\nx. 160, 4, is also, as it appears to me, incorrectly rendered by S\u0101yana. His explanation, as translated by Prof. Goldst\u00fccker, in his Dictionary, s.v. aratni, is as follows: \"Indra manifests himself (to the pious); (the sacrificer), who, though not wealthy, offers him the soma libation,\u2014him, Indra, the wealthy, holds in his hand (lit. fist, i.e. he protects him), after having defeated his enemies,\" etc. I would propose the following as a correcter translation: \"That man is observed by him (Indra) who, being rich, pours out to him no soma libation,\" etc. See my former paper \"On the relations of the priests to the other classes of Indian Society,\" p. 293, note 2, where this translation is vindicated.\n\nSome instances have already been given, in which S\u0101yana imports the ideas of a later age into his interpretation of the hymns. I give a few more illustrations of this tendency, both as it regards mythological and speculative conceptions.\n\nIn i. 170, 2, it is said: \"Why dost thou seek to kill us, Indra? the Maruts are thy brothers.\" On this the Commentator remarks: \"The Maruts are Indra's brothers, from having been produced from the same womb of Aditi; and this production is celebrated in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as.\" On this Professor Wilson annotates: \"Here, probably, nothing more is meant than affinity of function.\" The Maruts are not \u0100dityas according to the Rig-veda, and even Indra himself is not generally so called in the hymns. See my Art. on \"Vedic Cosmogony,\" etc., p. 39. In iii. 53, 5, the worshippers address Indra as \"brother.\"\n\nIn vii. 72, 2, the A\u015bvins are thus addressed: \"For there are paternal friendships between us, a common bond,\u2014acknowledge it.\" On this S\u0101yana annotates: \"Vivasvat and Varuna were both sprung from Ka\u015byapa and Aditi. Vivasvat was the father of the A\u015bvins (see my Art. on the A\u015bvins,\nin \"Contributions to a knowledge of Vedic Theogony,\" etc., No. ii. p. 2), and Varu\u1e47a of Vasishtha;\" and then he quotes the Brihaddevat\u0101 to prove the second of these relationships, which is also alluded to in R.V. x. 17, 2. The third is perhaps deducible from R.V. vii. 33, 10, ff.; see Sanskrit Texts, i. 75, ff., and Prof. Wilson's translation of the passage. It may be doubtful whether either of those other texts of the R.V. is so old as the one before us. Prof. Roth thinks the verses of R.V. vii. 33, in which Vasishtha's birth is alluded to, are conceived very much in the taste of the epic mythology, and are attached to an older hymn. But even if both these Vedic legends about the birth of the A\u1e63vins and Vasishtha, respectively, are as ancient as the verse I have quoted, vii. 72, 2, still the link by which S\u0101ya\u1e47a connects them, and which is necessary to establish the relationship of the author of the hymn (supposing him to be Vasishtha, or a descendant of Vasishtha) with the A\u1e63vins, is certainly not Vedic, as we are nowhere told in the hymns that Vivasvat and Varu\u1e47a were sons of Ka\u015byapa and Aditi. If Vivasvat be identified with S\u016brya, he would, indeed, be, according to some parts of the R.V., an \u0100ditya, or son of Aditi, but not otherwise. See Art. on Vedic cosmogony, p. 75, f. In a later work, the Taittiriya \u0100ranyaka i. 13, 3, he is named among the \u0100dityas. There is no difficulty in supposing that the passage before us does not contain any mythological allusion. In other places also reference is made to the former (vi. 18, 5) or ancestral (vi. 21, 8; i. 71, 10) friendship of the worshippers with the gods.\n\nIn i. 114, 6, Rudra is called the father of the Maruts. To explain this S\u0101ya\u1e47a in loco tells a story that: \"Indra, once on a time, overcame the Asuras, when Diti, their mother, desiring to have a son who should be able to avenge her vanquished sons by slaying the Thunderer, practised austerity and became pregnant by her husband. Indra, learning this news, entered into her womb in a very minute form, with a thunderbolt in his hand, divided her foetus into seven parts, and again made each of those parts into seven. These fragments all issued from the womb and wept. At this con-\njuncture Paramesvara (Rudra), and Parvati (his wife), were passing by for amusement, and saw them. Parvati said to her husband: 'If you love me, make all these bits of flesh become severally sons.' He accordingly made them all of the same form and age, and decked with similar ornaments, and gave them to her, saying: 'Let them be thy sons.'\"\n\nThe Maruts ought thus to be \\((7 \\times 7 = 49)\\) forty-nine in number. In R.V. viii. 28, 5, however, (if, indeed, the Maruts are there intended) they are only spoken of as seven. Sayana there gives a modified version of the story, to the effect that when Aditi (not Diti) desired to have a son equal to Indra, and her fetus had, from some cause, been split into seven by Indra, the seven parts became seven troops (of Maruts).\n\nIt may be questioned whether, in styling Varuna, in conformity with modern ideas, \"the deity presiding over the waters\" (\\(jal\u0101bhim\u0101nt deva\u1e25\\)), (as he does in R.V. i. 161, 14; viii. 53, 12), Sayana does not derive some support from expressions in the hymns themselves. (See the passages quoted in pp. 86 f. of my \"Contributions to a Knowledge of Vedic Theogony,\" etc.) In one of those texts, however, vii. 49, 3, the waters, in the midst of which Varuna is said to move, \"beholding the truth and falsehood of men,\" seem to be rather aerial than oceanic, as the former, from their position above the earth, would appear to afford to the god (when anthropomorphically regarded) a more convenient post of observation than the latter. And in vii. 64, 2, the epithet, sindhupatt, \"lords of the sea,\" (or \"of rivers,\" nady\u0101\u1e25 p\u0101layit\u0101rau, Sayana), is applied not only to Varuna but to Mitra also, who is not, that I am aware of, ever connected with the sea, even in later mythology. If we add to this, that these two gods are solicited to send food and rain from the sky, it may result that they are called sindhupatt, as supplying the aerial waters by which terrestrial streams are filled. But Sayana does not generally style Varuna the god of the sea, but in conformity with older conceptions, the deity who presides over the night. (See the paper above quoted, pp. 77 f.)\n\nThe epithet Kausika is applied in R.V. i. 10, 11, to Indra.\nS\u0101ya\u1e47a says it means son of Ku\u1e63ika, and repeats a story from the Anukramanik\u00e2, or Index to the R.V., which relates that that person, wishing a son like Indra, practised chastity, in consequence of which Indra was born to him in the form of G\u0101thin. Roth, s.v. thinks the epithet may have originally meant \"belonging, devoted to the Ku\u1e63ikas.\" The word is given in the Amara Kosha as denoting Indra, bdellium, owl, and snakecatcher.\n\nI have mentioned above that S\u0101ya\u1e47a understands R.V. i. 22, 16, 17, to refer to one of the incarnations of Vish\u1e47u. On r. 16, he speaks of Vish\u1e47u as parame\u015bvara, \"the supreme deity.\" On i. 156, 4, he proposes either to take Vish\u1e47u for the sacrifice, according to the idea of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, or as the creator (redhas) of the Maruts, whose function as preserver Varu\u1e47a and the other gods recognize.\n\nOn i. 43, 1, S\u0101ya\u1e47a derives the name Rudra from the root rud, \"to weep,\" denoting the god who \"makes everything to weep at the time of the end,\" and thus identifies him with the Mah\u0101deva of later mythology. (See Wilson's note in loco).\n\nS\u0101ya\u1e47a gives, optionally, a spiritual meaning to the words in i. 50, 10: \"looking aloft to the upper light above the darkness, the Sun, a god among the gods, we have arrived at the highest luminary.\" He says the phrase \"above the darkness\" may mean \"above the night,\" or \"above sin,\" and quotes a text which explains this passage and declares that \"darkness is sin,\" etc.\n\nOn R.V. i. 71, 4, Prof. Wilson's note will further illustrate S\u0101ya\u1e47a's practice of introducing later ideas into his explanations: \"M\u0101tari\u1e63van is a common name of V\u0101yu, or wind; but it is here said to mean the principal vital air (mukhya-pr\u0101\u1e47a) divided (cibh\u1e5bta) into the five airs so denominated, as in a dialogue between them, cited by the Scholiast, etc., etc.\"\n\n1 Prof. Wilson has the following remarks in a note on R.V. v. 2, 1: \"According to what is no doubt the most accurate interpretation of this verse, and of those which follow, they contain only a metaphorically obscure allusion to the lighting of the sacrificial fire: the mother is the two pieces of touchwood, which retain fire, the child, and will not spontaneously give it up to the father, the yajam\u0101na, until\nR.V. i. 115, 1 (\"The sun, soul of whatever is moving or stationary, has filled heaven, air, and earth\") is thus explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a: \"The sun, existing within such an orb, being, from his pervasiveness, the supreme spirit (param\u0101tm\u0101), the mover of the universe, is the soul, the substance (svar\u016bpa-bh\u016bta\u1e25) of whatever is moving or stationary. For he is the cause of all effects stationary or moving; and the effect is not distinct from the cause,\" etc. \"Or, he is the life-soul (j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101) of all creatures stationary or moving; for when the sun rises, all the world which was before nearly dead, is perceived to be again sentient.\" Though the latter explanation, no doubt, most nearly approaches the true one, still the first is also proposed by S\u0101ya\u1e47a as admissible, at least, if not preferable.\n\nS\u0101ya\u1e47a translates redhasah sa\u015bvata\u1e25 in i. 72, 1, by nityasya vidh\u0101turbrahma\u1e47ah \"of the eternal creator Brahm\u0101.\" Though this sense of \"eternal creator\" is adopted by Benfey, in his version (Or. und Occ. i. p. 601), I should hesitate to admit that it can correctly represent the sense of the ancient bard.\n\nThe word brahm\u0101 in R.V. i. 164, 35, is explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a as Praj\u0101pati, though there does not appear to be any reason for supposing that it has that sense anywhere in the R.V., and though the other three clauses of the verse, which relate to sacrifice and objects connected therewith, the altar and the soma-juice, lead to the conclusion that \"priest\" is the proper rendering.\n\nR.V. iii. 53, 9, is another passage in which S\u0101ya\u1e47a's interpretation seems to have been influenced by post-vedic legends. We are told in the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a (i. 60, 2 ff.; see Sanskrit Texts, i. 103), that Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra on a certain occasion created new constellations. S\u0101ya\u1e47a appears to find a reference to this story in the words mah\u0101n rshir devaj\u0101 devaj\u016bta\u1e25, \"the great Rishi, god-born, god-impelled,\" which\n\nforced by attrition: till then, also, people, the priests, do not behold it, but they see it when bursting into ignition: this, however, has not satisfied the commentators, and a curious and strange legend has been devised for the interpretation of the text, or has been, perhaps, applied to it by way of explanation, having been previously current: it is more probably, however, suggested by, than suggestive of, the verses,\" etc., etc.\nrefer to this personage, and which he explains: \"The great Rishi, seer of objects beyond the reach of the senses, who had by austerity acquired intense power, generator of shining lights (devaj\u0101 dyotam\u0101n\u0101nam tejas\u0101m janayit\u0101), drawn by those lights\" (devaj\u016btas tais tejohhir \u0101k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e25), etc. The real sense of the terms devaj\u0101 devaj\u016bta\u1e25 seems to be that which I have given above. J\u0101h is found in the Nigha\u1e47\u1e6du, ii. 2, as one of the synonymes of apatya, \"offspring;\" and devaj\u016bta is explained by S\u0101yana in R.V. vii. 25, 5; viii. 31, 3, as \"impelled by the gods\" (devai\u1e25 prerita). [It is to be observed, however, that Y\u0101ska (x. 28) gives a double interpretation of this latter word, as meaning (in R.V. x. 178, 1) either deva-gatam deva-pritam eva, \"gone to the gods,\" or \"beloved by the gods.\"] Prof. Wilson partly follows, and partly deviates from, S\u0101yana, in his translation of R.V. iii. 53, 9, which runs thus: \"The great Rishi, the generator of the gods, the attracted by the deities,\" etc.; and observes, in a note: \"Devaj\u0101\u1e25 is explained by S\u0101yana, the generator of radiances or energies . . . . the compound is not devaj\u0101, god-born, nor was Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra of divine parentage.\" In reference to this last remark see Wilson's note on R.V. i. 10, 11, and Sanskrit Texts, i. 82. The non-existence of any Puranic legend ascribing a divine origin to Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra ought not, however, to influence our translation of a Vedic text. And it is not undeserving of notice that, following S\u0101yana, Prof. Wilson had but shortly before translated R.V. iii. 29, 15, thus: \"The Ku\u1e63ikas, the first-born of Brahm\u0101,\" etc. etc. The Ku\u1e63ikas were the tribe to which Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra belonged. S\u0101yana's words in explanation of this last text are these: Brahmanah sarvasya jagata\u1e25 srash\u1e6duh prathamaj\u0101\u1e25 prathamotpannah, \"the Ku\u1e63ikas, the first-born of Brahm\u0101, the creator of the whole world.\" This translation is, however, the result of modern ideas, as I believe it is generally recognized (as already intimated) that there is no passage in the R.V. in which the personal creator (Brahman in the masculine) is mentioned, and in the present case the accent shows that the word is neuter, and therefore signifies \"prayer.\" See the story about the birth of Vasish\u1e6dha in R.V. vii. 33, 10 ff. (Sanskrit Texts, i. 75 ff.), and compare\nthe word *devaputra* applied to the Rishis in x. 62, 4, where, though the traditional accent makes the word a *Bahuvrhi* compound, with the sense, \"having gods for their sons,\" Prof. Roth, s.v., thinks that, with a different accentuation, changing it into a *Tatpurusha*, the meaning may be conjectured to be, \"sons of the gods.\" But if other Rishis were sons of the gods, why should not Vi\u1e63v\u0101mitra also have been fabled to be so?\n\nIn R.V. iii. 62, 10, (the celebrated G\u0101yatr\u012b), Savitri is interpreted \"the supreme lord, the creator of the world, who impels by his all-pervading presence;\" and *bhargas* is \"the self-resplendent light, the glory of the supreme Brahma.\" Another explanation of Savitri as the sun is however given.\n\nThe word *tredh\u0101* in the last clause of R.V. vi. 69, 8, *tredh\u0101 saha\u015bram vi tad airayetham* (\"ye then scattered a thousand into three parts\"), is explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a as meaning \"existing in the threefold form of world, veda, and speech;\" and a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a is quoted to support the interpretation. (See the entire passage in \"Sanskrit Texts,\" iv. 72, note 42).\n\nIn vii. 59, 12. *Tryambaka* is explained as \"the father of the three gods, Brahm\u0101, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, and Rudra.\" This conception of a triad, consisting of these three gods, seems, however, to have been unknown in the Vedic age. Y\u0101ska mentions a triad, but it consists of Agni, V\u0101yu (or Indra), and S\u016brya. (See \"Sanskrit Texts,\" iv, 136 f.) I should observe that the passage of S\u0101ya\u1e47a's Commentary from which this explanation is taken is put by the Editor, Prof. M\u00fcller, in brackets, as being derived from only one MS. See the extracts given from the other MSS. in p. 14 of the \"Varietas Lectionis\" prefixed to the 4th vol. of M\u00fcller's R.V. But even if the passage is not genuine, the style of interpretation found in it is that of the modern Indian commentators generally. Mahidhara explains *tryambaka* as the \"three-eyed Rudra.\" Prof. Wilson holds this text of the Veda to be spurious. The \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, ii. 6, 2, 9, gives another sense of the word *tryambaka*: \"He (Rudra) has a sister called Ambik\u0101, with whom he has this portion: and since he has this portion along with a female (*striy\u0101 saha*), he is called Tryambaka,\" (i.e. Stryam-\nbaka). This passage of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a refers to V\u0101j. S. iii. 57, where it is said: \"This is thy portion, Rudra, with thy sister Ambik\u0101.\"\n\nIn vii. 100, 4, it is said that \"Vish\u1e47u strode over this earth to give it for an abode to man (or Manu).\" \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a explains this last word, \"to the host of gods who praised him,\" to whom he was about to give it, \"after taking it from the Asuras.\" This explanation is, apparently, in conformity with more modern legends.\n\nvii. 101, 1. The first clause of this verse, viz., \"utter the three words of which light is the first,\" are explained by \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a as meaning \"the threefold praises in the form of rich, yajush, and s\u0101man verses, preceded by the brilliant pranava\" (or sacred monosyllable Om). An alternative explanation is, however, given, according to which the three words or sounds are \"the rapid, the slow, and the intermediate (thunderings), preceded by lightning.\"\n\nviii. 12, 27. The first words of the verse, addressed to Indra, (which, translated literally, run thus: \"when of thee Vish\u1e47u, by the strength,\" and mean apparently, \"when by thy strength Vish\u1e47u strode,\" etc.), are rendered by \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a, \"when thy younger brother Vish\u1e47u,\" etc. Prof. Wilson also observes that they might be translated \"when Vish\u1e47u by thy strength.\" The words \"younger brother,\" tar\u0101nujah, are not in the original. This idea of Vish\u1e47u being the younger brother of Indra is, I believe, unknown to the Veda, and of modern origin.\n\nIn viii. 19, 5, we have the words, \"the mortal who worships Agni with fuel, with an oblation, and with ved\u0101\" (whatever that may mean), etc. etc. \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a understands it of \"reading the Veda,\" which can scarcely be the sense. See on the meaning of the verse Prof. M\u00fcller's \"Anc. Sansk. Lit.\" p. 204 f., referred to by Prof. Wilson in loco.\n\nNotwithstanding these instances (which might, no doubt, be considerably multiplied) of \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a's tendency to allow the ideas of his own time to influence his exposition of the Veda, I think it must, in fairness, be admitted that, however incapable he may have been of fully comprehending and re-\nproducing the real spirit and genius of the hymns, he introduces into his interpretation of them, on the whole, much less of positive modern mythology and speculation than might, in a writer of his age, have been expected. A similar remark may be made in reference to Y\u0101ska, that although in his general observations, Nir. vii. 4, ff., he regards all the deities as being, ultimately, members of the one Soul, he does not, in the sequel, allow this dogmatical view to interfere with his detailed explanations of their individual characteristics.\n\nI extract from the notes to the fourth vol. of Prof. Wilson\u2019s translation of the R.V. a few admissions, in his own words, that he, too, occasionally failed to find in S\u0101yana a perfectly satisfactory guide.\n\np. 6. \u201cG\u0101vah is rendered by S\u0101yana ra\u1e63mayah, \u201crays:\u201d one of its meanings it is true, but rather incompatible here with the verb vahanti, vehunt.\u201d\u00b9\n\np. 94. \u201cThe addition of the comment, dev\u0101n\u0101m, seems somewhat superfluous; human wives would have been more in keeping with the prayer.\u201d\u00b2\n\np. 102. \u201c... the explanation is not very clear.\u201d\n\np. 103. verse 4. Prof. Wilson departs here, perhaps inadvertently, and I believe wrongly, from S\u0101yana in rendering saram, \u201cbirth.\u201d The word is explained by S\u0101yana as = prasaram, annj\u0101nam, \u201cpermission,\u201d but it is rather \u201cimpulse.\u201d (See my \u201cContributions to Vedic Theogony,\u201d etc., pp. 118 ff.)\u00b3\n\np. 144. . . . \u201che (S\u0101yana) seems rather puzzled.\u201d\n\np. 179. In his translation of a part of vii. 88, 6, Prof. Wilson deviates from S\u0101yana\u2019s rendering, as he understands it: \u201cM\u0101 te enasvanto bhujema, \u2018let us not, offending thee, enjoy\u2019\u2014it is not said what: the scholiast attaches the prohibitive to the verb, but gives a different turn to the sentence:\n\n\u00b9 Atanavat does not mean \u201cnot spreading or dispersing\u201d as Prof. Wilson translates it in p. 28, note 3, but \u201cgoing,\u201d atana-rat (not a-tana-vat).\n\n\u00b2 Prof. Wilson proposes, in p. 92, to take ay\u016btah as the genitive of ay\u016br, but I know of no such word as the latter with the sense of \u201cone not sacrificing.\u201d\n\n\u00b3 In p. 114, Prof. Wilson proposes a translation of a word left unexplained by S\u0101yana, svapic\u016bta, which is founded on an analysis not sanctioned by the Padu-text, as the latter divides the compound su + apic\u016bta, whilst Wilson would divide it svapi + v\u0101ta.\nbeing freed from sin through thy favour, let us enjoy enjoyments.\" 1\n\np. 211. \"The scholiast is rather puzzled how to interpret the duality here intimated.\"\n\np. 254. \"The second part of the stanza is rendered intelligible by the scholiast only by taking great liberty with some of the terms; and after all the meaning is questionable,\" etc.\n\np. 285. S\u0101chigo is not very satisfactorily explained,\" etc.\n\np. 286. \"The construction is loose, and the explanation is not very satisfactory.\"\n\nTo these admissions of Prof. Wilson, taken from the notes to vol. iv., I may add an observation from vol. i. p. 10, on S\u0101yana's attempts to explain the word ehim\u0101y\u0101s\u0101\u1e25: \"It is more than probable that the origin and import of the term were forgotten when S\u0101yana wrote.\" But if such was the case in this instance, why not also in many others, in which S\u0101yana appears to have had no other guide than a fanciful etymology?\n\nThe following are some additional instances from the notes to the first, second and third volumes of Prof. Wilson's translation:\n\nvol. i. p. 211, note. \"In this stanza, as usual in the more elaborate metres, we encounter strained collocations and elliptical and obscure illusions, imperfectly transformed into something intelligible by the additions of the scholiast,\" etc.\n\np. 215. \"This . . . is rather obscure . . . S\u0101yana does not make it more intelligible,\" etc.\n\np. 279. \"The terms thus rendered, in conformity to the explanations of the scholiast would seem rather to be intended for proper names,\" etc. etc. . . . \"The meanings may be supported by the etymology of the words, but the interpretation seems to be a needless refinement.\"\n\nvol. ii. p. 5. \"It would make better sense to render it,\" etc.\n\np. 36. \"The scholiast is evidently puzzled by the phrase.\"\n\np. 82. \"The scholiast repeats the Pauranik legend of the\n\n1 In a note to p. 193, Mr. Cowell corrects part of Prof. Wilson's translation of vii. 97, 6; but I do not see that the verse contains any word which can be rendered \"friendship.\"\nbirth of Dirghatamas from Mamata, . . . . but there is nothing in the text to warrant the application: the persons are obviously allegorical,\" etc. etc. (Whether Prof. Wilson is right here or not I need not try to decide).\n\np. 94. \"Some of these notions of the commentator are rather Paur\u0101nik than Vaidik.\"\n\np. 183. \"The passage is not very clear, and S\u0101ya\u1e47a's explanation does not remove the difficulty.\"\n\np. 293. \"But this is more of a Paur\u0101nik than a Vaidik legend.\"\n\np. 300. \"But this is Paur\u0101nik; apparently not Vaidik.\"\n\nvol. iii. p. 44. \"But this is a Paur\u0101nik notion, V\u1e5bttra, according to the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, being a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and by killing him Indra was guilty of the heinous sin of Brahmanahaty\u0101.\"\n\np. 155. \"These explanations are rather, perhaps, derived from the Paur\u0101nik developments of the original legends, imperfectly handed down.\"\n\np. 173. \"But this seems to be the notion of a later day.\"\n\np. 228. (R.V. v. 31, 7). Prof. Wilson does not follow S\u0101ya\u1e47a in rendering m\u0101y\u0101dh, \"young women,\" but adheres to the usual sense \"devices.\"\n\nProf. Wilson also in another place notices the gradual modification of the Vedic ideas by later Indian writers, vol. ii p. 87: \"The M\u1e47\u1e0daka Upanishad is also quoted for the attainment of heaven, dyuloka-pr\u0101ptih; the figurative expression of the text (R.V. i. 150, 3) having been converted into the assertion of a fact by the Upanishads; instancing the advance from simple metaphor to complex mythological notions.\"\n\nIn the translation of a part of R.V. vi. 59, 1, Prof. Wilson departs from S\u0101ya\u1e47a. He renders the words hat\u0101so v\u0101m pitaro deva\u1e63atravah by \"the Pitris, the enemies of the gods, have been slain by you, and you survive;\" whilst in his note he says: \"By Pitris, in this place, the scholiast says Asuras are intended, as derived from the root pt to inquire, plyatir hims\u0101-karm\u0101.\"\n\n[The passage is a curious one. The proper translation seems to be: \"Your fathers, to whom the gods were hostile, have been slain, whilst you, Indra and Agni, survive.\"\nProfessor Aufrecht suggests to me, that a former dynasty of gods is here alluded to as having been destroyed; and he refers, in illustration of this, to R.V. iv. 18, 12: \"Who (o Indra) made thy mother a widow? Who sought to kill thee lying or moving? What god was present in the fray, when thou didst slay thy father, seizing him by the foot?\" In vii. 21, 7, mention is made of earlier gods: \"Even the former gods admitted their powers to be inferior to thy divine prowess.\" And I apprehend that the two following verses, iv. 30, 3, 5, though otherwise rendered by Wilson (following S\u0101yana), are to be understood of Indra fighting against the gods, and not with the gods, against the Asuras. 3. \"Even all the gods assailed thee Indra, when thou didst prolong (?) day and night. 5. When thou didst fight alone against all the furious gods, thou didst slay the destructive.\" This interpretation is favoured by the tenor of verses 4, 6, 8\u201311 of the same hymn. Earlier gods are also mentioned in x. 109, 4, though in conjunction with the seven rishis: \"In regard to her the former gods said, the seven rishis who sat down to practise austerity,\" etc. An earlier age of the gods is mentioned in x. 72, 2, f.: \"In the former age of the gods, the existent\n\n---\n\n1 In explanation of this legend S\u0101yana refers to the Taittiriya Sanhita, vi. 1, 3, 6. The following is the passage referred to, which I quote to show how little light it throws on the text of the R.V.:\u2014Yajno dakshinim abhyadhyayat | tam samabhavat | tad Indro 'chigat | so 'manyata \"yo v\u0101 ito janishyate sa idam bhavisyati\" iti | t\u0101m pr\u0101v\u012bjat | tasy\u0101 Indra evuj\u0101yata | so 'manyata \"yo vai mad ito 'paro janishyate sa idam bhavisyati\" iti | tasy\u0101 annirgya yonim \u0101chhinat | s\u0101 s\u016btar\u0101ya 'bhavat | tat s\u016btar\u0101ya janna | t\u0101m haste nyavesh-tayata | t\u0101m mrgeshu nyaddh\u0101t | s\u0101 kr\u015bnavi\u015bh\u0101na 'bhavat! \"Indrasya yonir asi m\u0101 m\u0101 hi\u1e41si\" iti | \"Yajna (sacrifice) desired Dakshin\u0101 (largess). He consorted with her. Indra was apprehensive of this. He reflected: 'whoever is born of her will be this.' He entered into her. Indra himself was born of her. He reflected: 'whoever is born of her besides me will be this.' Having considered, he cut open her womb. She produced a cow.\" etc. No mention is made of his killing his father.\n\n2 I should observe that the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as constantly speak of the gods and Asuras as being both the offspring of Praj\u0101pati; as contending together (S. I. Br. v. 1, 1, 1; vi. 6, 2, 11; vi. 6, 3, 2); and even as being originally equal or alike (Sanskrit Texts, iv. 52). And to prove that even malignant spirits may be called \"gods,\" Prof. Roth, s.v. deva, quotes from the Taitt. Sanh. iii. 5, 4, 1, a verse to the effect: \"May Agni preserve me from the gods (dev\u0101\u1e25), destroyers of sacrificers, stealers of sacrifices, who inhabit the earth;\" and a second text from the A.V. iii. 15, 5: \"Agni, do thou through the oblation repel the gods who are destroyers of happiness\" (\u015b\u0101t\u0101ghnah).\nsprang from the non-existent. In the first age of the gods the existent sprang from the non-existent.\u201d See \u201cContribu-\nto a knowledge of the Vedic Theogony,\u201d etc., Journ. R.A.S.,\nfor 1864, p. 72; and compare Nirukta xii. 41, where a former age or generation (?) of gods, purvam devayugam, is referred to. I may add that A.V. vi. 64, 1, speaks of \u201cformer gods,\u201d and A.V. i. 30, 2, of some of the gods being fathers and some sons (ye vo dev\u0101h pitaro ye cha putr\u0101h.) R.V. viii. 48, 13, speaks of Soma in concert with the Fathers, having \u201cstretched out heaven and earth;\u201d and x. 68, 11, of the Fathers having \u201cadorned the sky with stars.\u201d But in these two passages the forefathers of the worshippers, supposed to have been raised to the rank of deities, may be meant. In R.V. x. 97, 1 (=V\u0101j. S. 12, 75; Nir. 9, 28; S. P. Br. 7, 2, 4, 26) mention is made of certain plants which were produced three ages (triyugam) before the gods.]\n\nI have alluded above to the fact that Prof. Goldst\u00fccker does not always coincide with the interpretations proposed by S\u0101yana. I will cite from his Dictionary a few further instances of this disagreement.\n\nOn the sense of \u201cone who does not praise the deity with\n\n---\n\n1 The verse which is illustrated in this passage occurs both in R.V. i 164, 50, and in R.V. x. 90, 16, as well as V\u0101j. S. 31, 16. The concluding words are yatra purve s\u0101dhy\u0101\u1e25 santi dev\u0101\u1e25, \u201cwhere (in the sky) are the former S\u0101dhyas, gods.\u201d Y\u0101ska, as I mentioned above, tells us that the Nairuktas understood the S\u0101dhyas to be \u201cthe gods whose locality is the sky,\u201d dyusth\u0101no devagamah, whilst, according to a legend (\u0101khy\u0101na), the term denoted a former age of the gods.\u201d Prof. Wilson translates the word S\u0101dhy\u0101\u1e25 by, \u201cwho are to be propitiated,\u201d a sense not assigned by S\u0101yana, who proposes, first, that of s\u0101dh\u0101na yaj\u00f1\u0101di-s\u0101dh\u0101navantah karmadev\u0101\u1e25, \u201cperformers, performers of sacrifices, etc., work-gods.\u201d These words are rendered by Prof. Wilson in his note on i. 164, 50, \u201cdivinities presiding over or giving effect to religious acts.\u201d This does not, however, appear to be the real sense, as Mahidhara on V\u0101j. S. 31, 17, tells us that \u201cthere are two kinds of gods, karmadev\u0101\u1e25, \u201cwork-gods,\u201d and \u0101janadev\u0101\u1e25, \u201cgods by birth,\u201d the first being those who had attained to the condition of deities by their eminent works, and the second those who were produced at the beginning of the creation. The second class is superior to the first, and, according to the Brihad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka, a hundred enjoyments of the latter (the work-gods), \u201care only equal to one single enjoyment of the former.\u201d See all this and more declared in the Brihad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upanishad, pp. 817 ff. (p. 230 f. of translation), and \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, p. 1087. The second sense proposed for s\u0101dhy\u0101\u1e25 by S\u0101yana on R.V. i. 164, 50, is that of the \u201cdeities presiding over metres,\u201d chanda bhim\u0101ni\u1e25, who, according to a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, by worshipping Agni were exalted to heaven, and became Adityas and Angiras. Prof. Wilson remarks in his note: \u201cIt would seem that in S\u0101yana\u2019s day the purport of the designation S\u0101dhy\u0101\u1e25 had become uncertain.\u201d Mahidhara on V\u0101j. S. 31, 16, renders the term vir\u0101d-up\u0101dhi-s\u0101dhak\u0101\u1e25, \u201cproducers of the condition of Vir\u0101j.\u201d\nhymns,\u201d proposed for amati, he remarks (p. 343): \u201ca doubtful meaning; it is proposed, besides the meaning \u2018poverty,\u2019 by S\u0101ya\u1e47a on\u201d (R.V. v. 36, 3).\n\nOn the word amit\u1e5b\u0101 he observes: \u201cThe same meaning (disease) applies satisfactorily to all other Vaidik passages where I have met with the word as a feminine; but S\u0101ya\u1e47a has also the following interpretations, which seem artificial,\u201d etc.\n\nOn the alternative rendering of am\u016bra by \u201ccombined with,\u201d etc., he remarks: \u201cThis meaning which is given by S\u0101ya\u1e47a as an optional one, and the etymology on which it is founded by him, have little plausibility.\u201d\n\nUnder the word ambi he writes \u201c(Ved.) water. S\u0101ya\u1e47a holds that the word implies as well this meaning . . . as that of \u2018mother,\u2019 . . . so that it would express a double sense; but there seems to be no necessity to assign to it any other meaning than water.\u201d\n\nUnder ay\u0101 he says: \u201cS\u0101ya\u1e47a here takes the instrum. ay\u0101 as implying the sense of a genitive; . . . but it seems more probable that, as in other instances, some word, e.g. \u0101huty\u0101, etc., has to be supplied to it.\u201d\n\nAfter giving under ay\u0101sy\u0101 the sense assigned by S\u0101ya\u1e47a to that word, he observes, \u201cbut it seems that \u2018unable to be conquered,\u2019 might be more congenial with the context.\n\nUnder ar\u0101\u1e47a he remarks: \u201cBut S\u0101ya\u1e47a has the improbable interpretation, \u2018unpleasant, painful;\u2019\u201d and again, \u201cS\u0101ya\u1e47a renders here ar\u0101\u1e47a in a very improbable manner, \u2018free from debt.\u2019\u201d\n\nUnder aramati he writes: \u201cThere seems no reason for adopting the other\u2014rather artificial\u2014meanings proposed by S\u0101ya\u1e47a, and mentioned under ii. and iii.\u201d\n\nUnder arari iii. he says: \u201cBoth meanings appear to have been coined by S\u0101ya\u1e47a for the sake of explaining the sense of ararinda.\u201d\n\nIf the principle that S\u0101ya\u1e47a is open to free criticism of this description be admitted at all, the lengths to which dissent from his conclusions may be allowed to go must depend upon the discretion of the critic, and upon the philological principles which he adopts.\nIn rendering the particle *an\u0101*, \u201ccertainly,\u201d \u201cindeed,\u201d Prof. Goldst\u00fccker *s.v.* departs from S\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s explanation, at least in the only two places in which I have access to it, viz., R.V. iv. 30, 3, and viii. 47, 6, as on the former text he says it means *pr\u0101\u1e47a-r\u016bpena balena*, \u201cby strength in the shape of breath,\u201d and on the second that it signifies *pr\u0101\u1e47a-yuktah*, \u201cpossessed of breath.\u201d I am not aware how he renders it in x. 94, 3, 4.\n\nSome apology is perhaps due to the Society for the long and minute examination into which I have entered of words and passages expounded by Y\u0101ska and S\u0101ya\u1e47a. But it is evident that the only way in which a satisfactory estimate can be formed of the merits of any interpreter is by the presentation of such details. General assertions on such a subject, unless perceived to be founded on a sufficient induction of particulars carefully selected and thoroughly sifted, cannot be expected to command assent, especially if they run counter to opinions previously current.\n\nIt will be seen from the tenor of my observations that my object has not in general been to ascertain the true meaning of the words which I have discussed (though I have occasionally aimed at doing this), but to show either (1) that Y\u0101ska and S\u0101ya\u1e47a are at variance with one another in regard to the sense of particular terms; or (2) that they have each given one or more alternative explanations of many words, and cannot therefore be supposed to have had in such cases any positive knowledge of the real signification; or (3), as regards S\u0101ya\u1e47a, that he expounds numerous words differently in different places (without, as I presume, any justification of this variation in sense being in general discoverable in the context), and must, therefore, in some of those instances, at least, be held to have interpreted them wrongly.\n\nFrom a consideration of these facts I am led to the conclusion that there is a large number of the most difficult words in the Rig-veda of the proper sense of which neither Y\u0101ska nor S\u0101ya\u1e47a had any certain information, either from tradition or from etymology.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 In regard to Indian tradition Prof. Benfey remarks as follows in note 450 to his translation of R.V. i. 51, 5, in his Orient und Occident: \u201cIf we compare\nAnd this ignorance or uncertainty regarding the meaning of Vedic terms did not, as we have already seen, begin even with Y\u0101ska. It is clear from the preceding investigation that some important discrepancies in opinion prevailed among the older expositors, and the different schools of interpretation which flourished before his time. It has further been shewn that the Nighantus and the Nirukta are too limited in scope, as well, as in many instances, too general, or too uncertain, in their explanations, to serve as adequate helps for the elucidation of the hymns. The Nighantus, as we have found, do not expound nearly the whole of the obscure and obsolete words which they cite from the Veda, and the meanings which they do assign are often so vague as to leave us quite uncertain as to the specific signification of the terms.\n\nAs we cannot tell for how long a period the hymns had ceased to be commonly understood, and particular words occurring in them had fallen into disuse before these vocabularies were compiled, it is possible that, in some cases, even the general meanings to which I have alluded may be incorrect, or, at least, may be different from those which the words had had in the earliest times. As regards the Nirukta, to say nothing of the fact formerly noticed, that it is but a very small portion of the hymns which it interprets at all, I think it is evident, from the instances I have given, that in the part which it does attempt to explain, the author depends very much upon etymological considerations for the senses he assigns; and this is made still more manifest by the fact of his frequently proposing two or more alternative or optional significations for the same word. Now it is possible that one or other of these explanations may be correct, or may be useful in suggesting the true sense; but the fact that Y\u0101ska offers us a choice of meanings seems to exclude the\n\nthe Indian interpretation, we recognize, as we have so often to do, how extremely little value we ought to attach to Indian explanations of words. On the other hand the correct explanation of things seems often to have been handed down, and such appears to be the case in the present instance.\"\n\nOn i. 61, 7, the same writer observes, note 614: \"This is a strophe which is perhaps the best calculated to show how little use can be made of Indian tradition for the understanding of the Vedas, or rather how greatly it misunderstood them.\"\nsupposition that he had any certain knowledge, from tradition or otherwise, that any of them were entitled to the preference. No one, I presume, will imagine for a moment that the writers of the hymns had, as a general rule, more than one meaning in their minds.\n\nAs regards S\u0101yana, it seems doubtful if he had any other authorities than those which he cites, such as the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as (among which he mentions the Aitareya, Kaushitaki, Taittiriya, \u015aatapatha, \u015a\u0101ty\u0101yana, Shadvin\u015ba, T\u00e2ndya, and possibly others), the \u0100ranyakas, the Nirukta, the Brhaddevat\u0101, etc. In his remarks on R.V. iv. 24, 9, he also refers to \"ancient teachers acquainted with tradition\" (samprad\u0101ya-ridah p\u016brv\u0101-ch\u0101ryy\u0101\u1e25), whose verses he quotes; and as we have seen above, he adduces in one place the name of Kapardin as authority for one of his interpretations. As he so frequently quotes the works in question to support his views, there is every reason to suppose that, in all important cases, he made it a practice to prove his point by reference to an older text, whenever he found one extant which could serve his purpose; and if so, we may generally infer that when he cites no such evidence, he had none to produce.\u00b9\n\nThe specimens which I have brought together of S\u0101yana's defects and mistakes have been collected in the course of a few weeks from a very small portion of his voluminous work. It is therefore perfectly just to conclude that, if his whole commentary were carefully examined, it would be found to be pervaded throughout by faults of the same description. But although I have no doubt whatever that such is, in reality, the case, I will not be so unreasonable as to deduce from\n\n\u00b9 In as far as S\u0101yana was in the habit of confining his view to the single text before him (which I admit was not always the case) the following curious passage (Nirukta parisishta 1, 12) which gives a just view of the principles of Vedic interpretation, might seem to have been written with a prophetic reference to his case, and conveys a lesson not altogether inapplicable even to Christian divines, who have been too much in the habit of expounding their sacred texts without reference to the connection. \"This reflective deduction of the sense of the verses is effected by the help both of oral tradition and reasoning. The verses are not to be interpreted singly, but according to the context. For one who is not a rishi or a tapasvin has no intuitive insight into their meaning. . . . . When the rishis were departing, men said to the gods, 'Who shall be our rishi?' The gods gave them this reasoning for a rishi,\" etc., etc.\nthese premises the sweeping conclusion which might be expressed in the words *ex uno disc\u00e9 omnia*, but will merely draw the more moderate and much fairer inference that there is no unusual or difficult word or obscure text in the hymns in regard to which the authority of the Indian Scholiast should be received as final, unless it be supported by probability, by the context, or by parallel passages. It follows, as a necessary corollary, that no translation of the Rig-veda which is based exclusively on S\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2019s commentary can possibly be satisfactory.\n\nIt would, however, be preposterous to deny that there is a large proportion of his interpretations from which most material help can be derived; that his Commentary altogether has been of the utmost service in facilitating and accelerating the comprehension of the Veda; that it has made many things clear at once which it might otherwise have taken long and laborious investigation to discover: and that it ought to be constantly consulted before any interpretation based on etymology, on the context, or on comparison of parallel passages, is proposed. No reasonable man will deny this. It would be simply absurd to neglect any aid derivable from the productions of extant Indian scholarship.\n\nAfter all, however, there is probably little information of value derived from S\u0101ya\u1e47a which we might not, with our knowledge of modern Sanskrit, with the other remains of Indian authorship, and our various philological appliances, have sooner or later found out for ourselves. It is not easy to conceive that many important problems presented by Vedic antiquity could have long remained, or can now long remain, insoluble by the resources and processes of modern scholarship,\u2014a scholarship which has already decyphered the cuneiform writings of Persia and the rock inscriptions of India, and discovered the languages which lay hid under those mysterious characters.\n\nBut whatever may be our obligations to S\u0101ya\u1e47a or Y\u0101ska, there is no reason why we should stand still at the point to which they have conducted us, if we have the means of advancing further. If a pupil possesses advantages denied\nto former generations, it is surely unreasonable to charge him with presumption if he seeks to go beyond his master. It is no disparagement to S\u0101ya\u1e47a, if those European scholars who have begun by taking him for their guide should be able gradually to improve upon his lessons, and should end by rejecting a good deal that they have learned from him, as erroneous. This is the natural course of science in general, and there is no reason why Vedic philology should be an exception.\n\nThere can, as it appears to me, be no doubt that the understanding of the Veda has been already materially promoted by the labours of Professor Roth and the other philologists who belong to the same school. That in some cases their proposed interpretations are erroneous, is, if true, no argument against the judicious application of the correct and scientific principles on which they profess to proceed. The new school has existed but for a very short time; the labourers connected with it are few; and it is not to be wondered at, if, in a novel and untrodden field, some mistakes should have been committed. The merits of a method are not to be estimated by the results which have attended the first essays of its advocates. These earliest attempts may have partially failed from want of skill or experience. Complete success can only be expected to follow the efforts of several generations of scholars. The interpretation of the Old Testament is a parallel case to that of the Vedic hymns. In how many passages of the Psalms and Prophetical Books does the sense still remain obscure and disputed, notwithstanding all that has been done for their elucidation by the critical acumen of Hebraists during several centuries!\n\nAll this is admitted by Prof. Roth, who, far from claiming infallibility for his opinions, thus expresses himself in the Preface to his Lexicon (vol i. p. vi.):\n\n\"This part of our Dictionary, as it is the earliest, will also be the first to grow old, for the combined labour of many able scholars, whose attention is now directed to the Veda, will rapidly promote our understanding of it, and determine many things with greater truth and precision than was possible for us on our first attempt. Centuries have toiled at the lexicographical interpretation of Homer,\"\nand yet his vocabulary is not entirely explained, though, in point of language, Homer presents incomparably fewer difficulties than the Vedic hymns. How could people expect to transfuse, without delay, into other languages, these monuments of a remote antiquity which is preserved to us in writing nowhere else but here, just as if they were a piece of modern book-making?\"\n\nProf. Roth has already given sufficient proof of his readiness to correct any interpretations which further research has led him to regard as erroneous. Compare the meanings assigned to an\u1e5btadeva and antideva with the close of the article deva; ar\u0101y\u0101, \u0101p\u0101ntamanyu, krivi, n\u016bnam, paritakmy\u0101, as explained in his Lexicon, with the senses previously given to the same words in his Illustrations of the Nirukta, p. 62, p. 95, p. 96, p. 6, p. 151.\nART. X.\u2014An Attempt to Translate from the Chinese a Work known as the Confessional Service of the Great Compassionate Kwan Yin, possessing 1000 Hands and 1000 Eyes. By the Rev. Samuel Beal, Royal Navy.\n\nThis work was presented to the Translator by the Priests of the Hai Chwang Temple of Honan.\n\nImperial Preface to the Liturgical Services of the Great Compassionate Kwan Yin. [Written by Yung Loh, of the Ming Dynasty, 1412 A.D.]\n\nThis Preface being written in the usual terse style of such compositions, and being without punctuation, is not translated verbatim.\n\nIt is reported that Kwan Tseu Tsai Bodhisattva, prompted by her great compassionate heart has engaged herself by a great oath to enter into every one of the innumerable worlds, and bring deliverance to all creatures who inhabit them.\n\nFor this purpose she has enunciated the Divine sentences which follow, which, if properly recited, will render all creatures exempt from the causes of sorrow, and by removing them, render them capable of attaining Supreme Reason.\n\nAnd if the virtuous man, who has already attained the happiness consequent on True Wisdom, still continue to recite these sentences, and by his correct line of conduct induce others who believe not to follow his example, and to accept the Truth and believe in it\u2014how great his happiness!\n\nSo we, the Ruler of the Empire, because of our pity for those who ignorantly immerse themselves wholly in the affairs of the world, and are not acquainted with the virtue of these Sentences to obtain for them deliverance, do hereby bring before them a mode for attaining to the condition of Supreme Wisdom.\n\nAnd we do so the rather, because Tath\u00e2gata when in the world, did principally enforce the practical duties of Fidelity\n\n1 I have followed the usual mode of considering Kwan Yin as a female.\nand Obedience. From this it is plain that his religion is not a selfish system merely, but one which may do good to men and benefit the world.\n\nAs then by reciting these sentences we may attain to the Supreme condition which is termed \"beholding Buddha\"\u2014so unless in practice we follow the duties of Fidelity and Obedience, naught but misery awaits us.\n\nWe therefore earnestly exhort all men, whichever course they are pursuing, carefully to study the directions of this work, and faithfully to follow them.\n\nYung Loh, 9th Year, 6th Month.\n\nLiturgical Service of the Omnipotent and Omniscient Kwan Yin.\n\nPREFACE.\n\nIn preparing the altar of the great Merciful One the rules are these:\n\nThe image of \u015a\u0101kya Tath\u0101gata Buddha must be reverently placed on an altar facing the south.\n\nThe image of the Omnipotent and Omniscient Kwan Yin Bodhisattva should be reverently placed in the western quarter of the temple, facing east.\n\nThis figure of Kwan Yin may be either the one herein supposed (i.e., exhibited in the accompanying Plate, and commonly known as Kwan Yin, with 1000 arms and 1000 eyes), or it may be one with forty arms, or six arms, or four arms\u2014provided always it be made of the purest and best material, and with the greatest care.\n\nAt the dawn of day, before any act of worship be performed, the limits of the sanctuary [mandala] must be well defined. The following is the mode\u2014\n\nFirst, take a knife, and mark out on the ground the prescribed limits of the sacred place, at the same time repeating the words.\u00b9\n\nThen take pure water, and sprinkle it towards the four quarters, repeating the words.\n\nThen take clean ashes, and scatter them on the ground, repeating the words.\n\n\u00b9 So, at least, I understand the expression in the original.\nThen take a silken cord, consisting of threads of five colours, and bind it round the four sides of the sanctuary, repeating the words.\n\nIn all there must be twenty-one repetitions of the words.\n\nThe sacred limits having been thus determined, the next care must be to provide all necessary adjuncts of worship for the sanctuary, viz., flowing streamers, burning lamps, incense, flowers, offerings of food; all these must be carefully provided.\n\nThe incense, especially, must be prepared from sandal wood, not such as is commonly used, which may not be genuine, or, at least, not free from adulteration, but of the purest kind.\n\nIf the means be not found adequate to provide these necessary articles, there should be immediate consultation as to the best manner of laying out the funds in hand for the present necessity.\n\nThe western portion of the building should be covered with mats, or, if the ground be damp, kneeling stools may be provided.\n\nThe days appointed for worship and for reciting the sentences are the three seventh days of the month; the hours are six, viz., thrice in the morning and thrice in the evening. There must on no account be any abatement of the prescribed hours.\n\nBefore worship there must be due preparation, particularly the rules prescribed for the first of the seventh days (called \"Fong-pien;\" these rules are probably connected with the manumission of certain living creatures).\n\nBefore entering the sacred precincts due attention must be given to personal cleanliness; the garments worn must be new ones and clean, or, if not new, at any rate the best in the possession of the worshippers.\n\nIf during the service there be occasion to leave the temple, and visit any place of impurity, the clothes must be changed, and on returning from such a place the person must be washed, and on entering the place of worship the new clothes put on again. If there be no occasion throughout the whole day to\nvisit such impure place, yet the person should be washed once.\n\nOne hour before and after service there should be no mixed conversation. On meeting one another there should be merely the customary mode of respectful salutation.\n\nAfter the first service (i.e., the service of the first canonical hour) the mind should be chiefly occupied in considering and weighing the nature of the ten vows of obligation entered on. The thoughts should be so occupied without intermission. Even whilst eating and drinking such thoughts should be persevered in, nor should the impressions received be allowed to be lost.\n\nBut if at time of prayer there be no devotional thoughts, but only a confused way of going through external duties, deceiving both oneself and others, and if after worship there be indifferent conversation, gossiping and babbling, hurrying to and fro, lounging about or sleeping, just as on ordinary days; if there be such criminal acts of careless self-indulgence, what benefit or assistance can we look for from our religious exercises?\n\nThe rules and directions for the service must also be properly studied and prepared; so that in going through it there may be outward decorum observed as well as inward devotion, whilst each portion of it is properly rendered.\n\nWithout such preparation, at the time of beginning the service, the mind and thoughts will be confused and hurried, and so the whole course of it will be unprofitable and nugatory.\n\nFinally, let all disciples (lit. white-black) who have undertaken the precepts in earnest, and those who have not yet entered on a course of deep meditation (i.e., laymen), strive after a firm faith, and excite in themselves an earnest intention; and so having purified the three faculties of thought, speech, and action, and engaging in this worship in a spirit of entire devotion, they shall obtain their prayers.\n\nEnd of Preface.\nThe Service of Kwan Yin.\n\n[Direction.]\u2014The worshippers on entering the main court of the temple (lit. the Hall of Contemplation) shall reverently bow the head. On leaving it let them say\u2014\n\n[Invocation.]\u2014Hail! Great Compassionate Kwan Yin Bodhisattva!\n\n[Direction.]\u2014Slowly and reverently reciting this invocation, let them enter the sanctuary, and having invested the altar three times, and arranged themselves in an upright position, let them reflect thus:\n\n\"The body of the three precious objects of worship, and all the mass of sentient beings throughout the universe, differ in no essential respect from my own body and my own soul (heart). But all the Buddhas have arrived at complete wisdom, whilst all sentient creatures have been drawn away and deceived. For the sake, therefore, of these creatures, with a view to remove the obstacles and destroy the causes of delusion, I now enter upon this worship of the three precious objects.\" Having reflected thus, begin the following Hymn of Praise:\n\n[Hymn]\u2014\n\nHail diffusive Incense Cloud!\u00b9\nBright mirror of the Divine excellencies!\nFar spreading, boundless as the Heart of Wisdom.\nWherever lights one single ray (of that wisdom)\nThere is worship\u2014there is praise\u2014\nTo honor Him who reigns as king in the midst of all.\n\n[Invocation.]\u2014All Hail Incense-cloud-canopy, Bodhisattva! Mah\u00e2sattva. (To be repeated three times.)\n\n[Direction.]\u2014The Hymn of Praise being finished, then chant the following:\n\n[Chant.]\u2014Profoundly Reverent,\n\nIn close communion\u00b2 we adore the Everlasting Buddha,\nand the Everlasting Law, and the Everlasting Assembly.\n(One bow after each ascription.) [Then continue], \"This whole assembly, prostrate in adoration, holding flowers and incense, presents this bounden sacrifice.\n\n\u00b9 In all Buddhist Temples incense is continually burning before the various objects of worship.\n\u00b2 The phrase \"in close communion\" is an adaptation from the original, which is \"one heart.\" This phrase \"one heart\" is explained in an appendix of the present work to signify that worshippers and the object of worship are both \"one.\"\n[Direction.]\u2014Here the worshippers, holding flowers and incense in their hands, shall prostrate themselves and chant\u2014\n\n[Chant.]\u2014Oh! may this Incense cloud and the perfume of these flowers spread through the worlds of space (lit. of the ten regions), and reach to every land of all the Buddhas. May each of these lands be infinitely enriched and adorned, filled with\\(^1\\) the wisdom of the Bodhisattvas, and at length attain to the perfection of Tath\u0101gata.\n\n[Direction.]\u2014Then let the worshippers light the incense and scatter the flowers, and with profound reflection, say\u2014\n\nI scatter these flowers and this incense\nTo signify the mysterious character and the excellence of the Doctrine we (profess),\nSymbols of the harmony of Heaven and its holy joys (lit. precious perfume),\nEmblems of angels\u2019 food and their sacred vestments.\nHow impossible is it to exhibit in words the infinite portions of the mysterious\\(^2\\) universe!\nEach single atom evolved from all the atoms,\nEach single atom evolved from the aggregate of all,\nRevolving thus unhindered they unite in one harmonious whole.\nAnd thus diffused through space they appear before the three precious objects of worship,\nAnd before the three precious objects of worship throughout the vast collective universe.\nThus as I with my body offer this sacrifice,\nIt is presented throughout each region of the universe,\nUnhindered, unopposed by any external object;\nAnd so through endless ages yet to come, discharging these sacred duties,\nAll sentient creatures united at length with the Divine essence,\n(Thus united) shall attain the Heart of Wisdom,\\(^3\\) and\n\n\\(^1\\) The expression \u201cku tsuh\u201d is explained in the commentary on the twentieth section of the Kin-kong S\u016btra.\n\\(^2\\) Miau fah, i.e. saddharma.\n\\(^3\\) I need not say that in the translation of such passages as the above I can only hope to attain to some obscure idea of the meaning of the original.\ntogether enter on the State that admits of no Birth, the Wisdom of Buddha himself. Having concluded these offerings let all remain solemnly reverent.\n\n[Direction.]\u2014The officiating priest having finished this chant, bows once.\n\nThe body of worshippers, deeply meditating, having made their offerings, their incense still burning, and themselves still prostrate, ought to consider thus:\u2014\"The three precious objects of worship, although removed and distinct from us in respect of their essential purity, yet in respect of their very substance are one and the same with us, and therefore it is through their infinite love they continually regard and protect the whole body of sentient creatures. Can we only purify the three organs (body, speech, thought), they must of necessity come to us and remove sorrows and give joy. So let each one earnestly strive after this purity; then thrice invoked they will surely come and unite themselves with us.\" Let the worshippers now repeat the following chants.\n\n[Chant.]\u2014One in Spirit, respectfully we invoke thee. Hail! our own Teacher \u015a\u0101kya Muni Lokajit.\n\n[Secret.]\u2014My nature being one with that of Tath\u0101gata, if only the obstacles be removed, he will come and receive our offerings.\n\n[The following invocations are similar to the above, following in order]; viz. to\u2014\n\n2.

Would that the Great, perfect, illimitable compassionate Heart,\u00b9 influenced by these invocations, would now attend and receive our offerings.

Thou who protectest us ever from the evil ways of birth, who grantest us to be born in the presence of Buddha, who dispellest all troubles, evil diseases and ignorance, who by thy power of spiritual perception art able to appear always to answer prayer, causing that which is desired to be brought about, who removest all doubts, who art able to cause speedy acquirement of the three degrees\u00b3 of merit, and a rapid birth in the land of Buddha (or, in the position of Buddha); possessed of infinite spiritual power, beyond the capability of language to express, we therefore adore Thee and worship, with one heart and mind!\n\n[Direction.]\u2014The worshippers should be filled with holy joy and pious reverence, their hearts without confusion; they should render\n\n\u00b9 Namo ching-fah-ming-Ju-lai.\n\u00b2 The mark O in the original probably denotes a change of tone in the recitation of the chant.\n\u00b3 Lit. \"the three vehicles.\"\ndue homage; bowing three times at the mention of \u015a\u0101kya Buddha, or the Great Compassionate Dh\u0101ran\u012bs, or Kwan Yin Bodhisattva, for these are worthy of chief honour and adoration. Say, therefore, these invocations:\n\n[Invocation.]\u2014One in heart and mind, we worship Thee our own Teacher \u015a\u0101kya Muni Lokajit!\n\n[Direction.]\u2014Repeat three times; bow three times; and with deep reflection say secretly, \u201cThe nature both of the object and subject in worship is empty (immaterial). Difficult is it to explain the blending of the one with the other. I regard this sacred altar as a Royal gem (a mirror?),\u2014in the midst of it appears the shadow of \u015a\u0101kya Tath\u0101gata; my body also appears in the presence of \u015a\u0101kya; prostrate thus upon my face and hands I worship him, that hereafter all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas when invoked may duly appear.\u201d\n\n[Chant.]\u2014One in heart and mind we worship Thee Amit\u0101bha of the Western world Sukhavati Lokajit.\n\n[Here follow ascriptions of worship to all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas named in the former part of this service.]\n\n[Direction.]\u2014After these acts of worship, all the worshippers should bow once, then let the officiating priest proceed.\n\nThe Scripture saith: Whatever Bhikshu or Bhikshun\u012b, Up\u0101saka or Up\u0101sik\u0101, layman or laywoman, desires to recite the sentences of this service, in order to excite in the midst of all sentient creatures the operation of the Compassionate Merciful Heart, ought first with us to go through the following vows:\n\n[Direction.]\u2014Then all prostrate themselves and say,\u2014\nAll hail!

Kwan Yin Bodhisattva.\n\n[Direction.]\u2014To be repeated ten times, quickly. Let the worshippers here pray for deliverance from any particular calamity, such as fire, drowning, etc.\n\n[Invocation.]\u2014Hail! Amit\u0101bha Buddha.\n\n[Direction.]\u2014Ten times quickly repeated. Then let the officiating priest continue thus,\u2014\n[Lesson.]\u2014Kwan Yin, addressing Buddha, said,\u2014World-honoured one! Whilst the recitation of these divine sentences is ineffectual to deliver creatures from the three evil ways of birth, I vow never to arrive at the condition of Buddha! So long as those who recite these divine sentences are not born in the various lands of all the Buddhas, I vow never to arrive at that condition myself! So long as those who recite these divine sentences are unable to attain every degree of spiritual perception, I vow never to arrive at the condition of Buddha! So long as those who recite these divine sentences do not receive full answer to their prayers, I vow to remain as I am! Then, in the midst of all the congregation\u2014with closed palms, standing perfectly upright, exciting in all creatures the Great Compassionate Heart, her eyebrows raised, a smile on her lips\u2014Kwan Yin forthwith began to deliver these comprehensive, effectual, complete, Great Compassionate Heart Dh\u00e2ran\u00ee, mysterious and divine sentences.\n\n[Direction.]\u2014Then let all the priests recite together\u2014\n\nNamo ho lo tan na to lo ye ye,\nNamo ho li ye, Po lou ki ti lo che lo ye,\nBo ti sah to po ye, Mo ho ka lou ni ka ye,\nOm!\nSah pa lah fah ye.\n\n[These Dh\u00e2ran\u00ees being corrupt forms of Sanskrit or Pali words\u2014chiefly names of popular objects of worship, interspersed with interjectional phrases, such as Om, svah, etc.,\u2014I do not transcribe them further. The Sanskrit forms of the few written above appear to be Namo Ratnatray\u00e2ya, Namo Haraye, Avalokite\u015bvar\u00e2ya, Bodhisattv\u00e2ya, Mah\u00e2sattv\u00e2ya, Mah\u00e2karu\u1e47ik\u00e2ya, Om, etc., etc.]\n\n[Direction.]\u2014The worshippers having recited the Dh\u00e2ran\u00ee, must prostrate themselves on their faces and hands three times; then stand up four times in succession; then walk round the altar in procession eleven times; then stand up again three times in succession. In all twenty-one times.\nThis being finished, all standing upright, let the officiating priest continue thus,\u2014\nKwan Yin Bodhisattva having delivered these sentences, the great Earth trembled six times. The Heavens rained precious flowers, which fell down in commingled profusion. All the Buddhas of the ten quarters rejoiced. The powerful demons and the heretics shook with fear, and their hair stood on end. The members of the congregation immediately entered upon the paths, some on the path Sotapanna, some on the path Sakadagami, some on the path Anagami, some on the path of a Rahat; others again obtained that condition which is known as the first platform (one earth), others the second, others the third, and so on, up to the tenth (dasabhumii), and numberless others attained to the Heart of Wisdom (i.e., complete knowledge or Bodhi).\n\n[Direction.]\u2014One bow. The worshippers having finished the repetition of the sentences, ought to consider that all the connection of obstacles which prevent spiritual progress spring from sins committed in our condition as sentient creatures; that from the first till now, the sins of all created beings have been constantly going on, and that now the web of guilt has become intricate and complicated. Every age has intertwined its own peculiar crimes, which, descending from parent to child, have caused the obstacles to deliverance and the sorrows of our present condition. Without repentance there can be no remission. The law cannot be obeyed. Our sins, therefore, ought to be well considered and weighed that so they may be forgiven and destroyed.\n\nBowing low, say thus,\u2014\nWe, and all men from the very first, by reason of the grievous sins we have committed in thought, word, and deed, have lived in ignorance of all the Buddhas, and of any way of escape from the consequences of our conduct. We have followed only the course of this evil world, nor have we known aught of supreme wisdom; and even now, though enlightened as to our duty, yet, with others, we still commit heavy sins, which still prevent us advancing in true knowledge. Therefore, in the presence of Kwan Yin, and the Buddhas of the Ten Regions, we would humble ourselves and repent us of our sins. Oh! that we may have strength to do\nso aright, and that they may cause all obstacles to be removed.\n\n[Here with a loud voice add]\u2014\n\nFor the sake of all sentient creatures, in whatever capacity they be, would that all obstacles may be removed, we confess our sins and repent!\n\n[Direction.]\u2014A complete prostration. Then continue thus,\u2014\n\nWe, and all men from the first, from too great love of outward things, and from inward affection to men, leading to sinful friendships, having no wish to benefit others, or to do good in the least degree, have only strengthened the power of the three sources of sin, and added sin to sin; and even though our actual crimes have not been so great, yet a wicked heart has ruled us within; day and night, without interval or hesitation, have we continually contrived to do wrong. There has been no desire after knowledge, no fear of misery, no alarm, no heart-chiding, we have gone on heedless of all consequences. Now, therefore, believing from the bottom of the heart in the certain results of sin, filled with fear and shame, and great heart-chiding, we would thus publicly repent us of our sins; we would cut off our connection with worldly objects, and aspire to the Heart of knowledge; we would separate ourselves from evil and pursue good; we would diligently recount all our past offences and earnestly pursue the path of virtue, ever remembering the blessedness of Heaven, and the power of all the Buddhas to deliver and rescue us and all men from evil. Hitherto we have only gone astray, but now we return. Oh! would that the Merciful Kwan Yin would receive our vows of amendment.\n\n[Direction.]\u2014An entire prostration. Then add,\u2014\n\nWith all our heart do we (mentioning each one his name) repent of our sins. We all here prostrate ourselves before the sacred presence with all the countless beings of the infinite universe. [Here follow particular confessions of sin.] . . . So were we helpless and lost till we found out Kwan Shai Yin, the Great Teacher of the Ten Regions, who has manifested to all the source of true wisdom, . . . . so have we repented and returned. Would that the Great Compassionate Kwan\nYin Bodhisattva Mah\u0101sattva, possessing 1000 hands and 1000 eyes, would overcome and destroy all obstacles in our way; . . . . . . would that our original power of acquiring knowledge might develop itself, . . . . so that quitting this body we might obtain perfect rest and repose. . . . . Amit\u0101bha Buddha! of the world Sukhavat\u012b, receive our offerings!\n\nGreat Compassionate Kwan Yin, who art acquainted with all the sentences, fit to deliver every sort of creature, may all emerge from the wheel of transmigration and be saved.\n\n[Direction.]\u2014Having finished these vows connected with the confession and repentance of the worshippers, let adoration be once more paid to the three precious objects of worship.\n\nAll hail! Buddhas of the ten quarters!\nAll hail! Law of the ten quarters!\nAll hail! Assembly of the ten quarters!\nHail! \u015a\u0101ky\u0101 Muni Buddha!\nHail! Amit\u0101bha Buddha!\n\n[And so on as before.]\n\n[Direction.]\u2014Having walked round the altar in procession three times, once more returning before the image of Kwan Yin, proceed with these three forms of devout aspiration. (Kwai-i.)\n\nHaving myself returned to my duty to Buddha, I ought to pray for all men, that they may attain perfection of wisdom.\n\nHaving myself returned to my duty to the Law, I ought to pray that all men may be deeply versed in the wisdom of the Sacred Books, and acquire perfect knowledge.\n\nHaving myself returned to my duty to the Assembly, would that all men may agree in the great principles of Reason, and maintain Peace, and worship the Holy Assembly.\n\n[Direction.]\u2014(One bow.)\n\n[Invocation.]\u2014Namo! Kwan Shai Yin Bodhisattva.\n\n[Direction.]\u2014(Three times invest the altar, and then leave the sanctuary).\n\nKia King, 6th year, 7th month, 8th day.\n\nMay the merit of this book redound to the benefit of all men, so that I and all mankind may soon arrive at the condition of Buddha.\n\nvol. ii.\u2014[new series].\nRemarks.\n\nAs the Paradise of Amit\u0101bha is the desire of the great body of Buddhist worshippers in China and Japan, so Kwan Yin is reverenced and worshipped as the \"Saviour of men,\" able to remove the obstacles which prevent them from attaining that happy condition. Were the highest aspiration of the Buddhist, then, after annihilation, it would be difficult to account for the belief in the existence of such a beneficent and compassionate Being as their ideal of \"Kwan Yin,\"\u2014a Being who has declared his purpose, under the most solemn oath,\\(^1\\) to manifest himself to all creatures in the universe, for the purpose of delivering them from the consequences of sin, so long as any such creatures exist. But what is the deliverance promised? is it to lead to the annihilation of all such beings? No! but to their restoration to the \"one condition\"\\(^2\\) of happiness, in which all were included before the delusion of sense and of the organs of sense led them astray.\n\nThe explanation of the difficulty arising from the apparently different tenets held by the philosophical and religious schools of Buddhist believers, is to be found in the fact of a most important development having taken place in their philosophical views. Up to the time of \u0100ry\u0101sangha (who was contemporary with Vasubandhu, the 21st Patriarch, and who died, according to Edkins, A.D. 117,\u2014though I would suggest a later date,) the basis of every thing that exists was regarded as a \"mere void,\"\u2014in other words, that nothing really existed; but the Yog\u0101ch\u0101rya system, which developed itself under his auspices, substituted for this void a soul, or \u0101laya, which was at once the basis and the receptacle, so to speak, of all existence. \"This soul exists\\(^3\\) from time immemorial and in every object, it reflects itself in everything like the moon in clear and tranquil water. It was the loss of its original purity that caused it to wander about in the various spheres of existence. The restoration of the soul to its purity can be attained by the same means as\n\n\\(^1\\) Vide the end of the Translation for the form of this oath.\n\\(^2\\) Called in Chinese the \"One Heart,\" yih sin.\n\\(^3\\) Schlagintweit, p. 89.\nin the other systems (viz., by the practice of the P\u0101ramit\u0101s, etc.), but now its motive and the success become evident; ignorance is annihilated, and the illusion that anything ('except the soul') can be real is dissipated.... The dogma once established that an absolute pure nature exists, Buddhism soon proceeded, in the mystical school, further to endow it with the character of an all-embracing Deity.\" So that we have here something very definite, emerging from the uncertainty of previous systems. And it is to bring men back to this state of purity and happiness, that Kwan Yin, in different forms, is manifested to men, and by them worshipped and adored.\n\nThe method of proof on which this system rests, is well exhibited in the work called in Chinese, the Sing yan S\u016btra (\u015aurangama S\u016btra); in which, by a laboured process, but not altogether an illogical one, the existence of a Supreme Soul is demonstrated. And it is in this same work (Book vi.) that the character and office of the Bodhisattva Kwan Yin are properly explained. His character is one of pure mercy\u2014his office to deliver men from all their troubles, and to bring them to happiness\u2014and the peculiar mode of gaining his assistance is there declared to be by the recitation of a certain number of Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012bs, fully detailed in the same book (these Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012bs when restored to their Sanskrit originals, are found to be simple invocations of the deities and powers, known in the religions of India). The same method is also exhibited in the work here translated\u2014a good portion of which consists of the invocations above-mentioned, which are repeated by the priests in a low monotonous voice, and are believed to have the power of commanding the presence and assistance of superior beings. There is, however, a thread of reasonable worship running through the whole service, which commends it to our careful consideration, and suggests frequent enquiries as to the model after which it was framed. We are unable to answer any such questions at the present time: perhaps some Sanskrit original may be discovered and translated for the benefit of future students, but at present we must rest contented with what we have\u2014satisfied to know that Bud-\ndhism is not merely a cold philosophical system, or a system of morals only, or a system that binds men together as a community of religious mendicants; but beside all this, that it possesses a form of ceremonial worship, that includes in it a belief in future happiness and the existence of a Being of Supreme Power, and actuated by a principle of Supreme Love, manifested in His determination to deliver all creatures from their present evil condition.\n\nThe question now suggests itself, what do we know of the origin of the cultus herein described\u2014Who is this Kwan Yin possessing the Power, Knowledge and Love, attributed to him in this ceremonial worship?\n\nIf written in full the Chinese title of this Bodhisattva would be Kwan Shai Yin, a title translated by Sir J. Davis, \"She who hears the cries of men.\" By M. R\u00e9musat it is rendered, \"Vox contemplans seculum;\" whilst MM. Klaproth and Julien consider it as a mistaken version of the Sanskrit original, \"Avalokite\u015bvara.\"\n\nWithout doubt the original appellation of the Bodhisattva was Avalokite\u015bvara; but I think the theory that \"i\u1e63vara\" has been mistaken for \"swara\" is far-fetched.\n\nIt does not appear likely that the learned priests who superintended the translation of the originals into the Chinese, should have made such a mistake; on the contrary, we have proof that they did not, inasmuch as in the same chapter we frequently meet with both renderings \"Kwan Tseu Tsai\" and \"Kwan Shai Yin\" used indifferently; the first being the literal rendering of Avalokite\u015bvara, and the other the popular equivalent.\n\nWith respect to the correct English translation of these titles, we know that the common rendering of Kwan Shai Yin, is \"She who hears the cries of men,\" and hence the name, the \"Goddess of Mercy,\" given to this Bodhisattva; but this appears rather to be a description of his character, than a true translation of the name itself. In the 6th Book of the \u015aurangama S\u016btra, his character is fully described, as one who is always ready to assist and rescue men from trouble, hence he is always invoked in time of danger. Fah Hian,\nwhen nearly wrecked on the coast of Ceylon, tells us that he and his fellow religionists all called on the name of Avalokitesvara to save them from their peril. And so in many other cases that might be cited. The Temple of \"Fei-loi Kwan Yin\" in the city of Canton, was erected, or rather enlarged and beautified, after the first siege of that city by the English in 1842, because, as the printed account goes, \"Kwan Yin appeared on that occasion over the city to protect and save it, in consequence of which the shot and shells of the Barbarians fell harmless among the people.\" It was a misfortune, however, for the votaries of this worship, that on the occasion of the last bombardment of that city, the fire of the assailants happened to be directed immediately against that quarter of the city where stood that very temple, and, as might be expected, it was soon reduced to comparative ruin, and when we entered it, after cessation of the fire, we found the incense still burning and a few of the last suppliants for mercy still hovering about the ruined courts. This all shews the aspect in which Kwan Yin is regarded, and Avalokitesvara was regarded, by modern and ancient worshippers.\n\nStill I cannot think that the title the Bodhisattva bears can be literally Englishe by \"the Goddess of Mercy,\" or as M. Klaproth has it, \"The Being who contemplates with love.\" I know it is hazardous to suggest any other version after M. Burnouf has sanctioned such a signification for the passive participle, \"avalokita,\" but he appears to have lent his sanction to this rendering only on the ground that the Chinese and Thibetan equivalents required it. But if I am not mistaken the Chinese title, \"Kwan Shai Yin,\" or \"Kwan Tseu Tsai,\" may as well be rendered the \"Manifested voice,\" or the \"Manifested Self-Existent One,\" as by the active participle, \"She who contemplates\" or \"the contemplating\" the voices or cries of men. And if so, it seems only reasonable to suppose that in the original the passive participle was intended to have its real force: so that \"Avalokitesvara,\" or,\n\n1 Introduction to Indian Buddhism, p. 226, note.\nin Chinese, \"Kwan Teeu Tsai,\" may very justly be rendered \"the Manifested Deity.\"\n\nThis rendering is in absolute agreement with what is related concerning the peculiar attributes of this Bodhisattva, viz., that on being invoked by suppliants he manifests himself to deliver them. Hiouen Thsang relates how those who worshipped him, were rewarded by his coming out, as it were, from the image before which they said their prayers. And so, also, as to the origin of the worship, he tells us that on the top of Mount Potalaka (perhaps Pedura-Talla-Galla, in Ceylon) this divinity was accustomed to manifest himself under various forms, sometimes as I\u1e63vara, at others as one of the Pa\u015bupatas, and so on, just as the occasion required. In fact, the secret of all the reverence paid to him is the belief that Avalokitesvara would reveal himself to the devotees who frequented his shrine, and bring them deliverance; hence it appears that the title, \"the Manifested Deity,\" or \"I\u1e63vara,\" is not an unlikely rendering of the original.\n\nBut it may be asked whence the title Kwan Shai Yin is derived, and how can such a translation as the one proposed, viz., the \"Manifested Voice,\" be supported. In reply to this, it must be considered that the worship of Kwan Yin was probably introduced into China from the northern school of Buddhism, and not from Ceylon. There is no such Divinity as Kwan Yin, or Avalokitesvara, known amongst the southern Buddhists. Yet most probably the cultus originated amongst them, if not in the island of Ceylon itself. But the worship of Avalokitesvara in those parts was simply the worship of Vishnu, who we know is described as manifesting himself (as to Vijaya) in different forms to all those whom he regarded with favour, and we know also that Ceylon was always considered as being under the protection of Vishnu; hence, I say, the possibility of this particular worship having been imported into Buddhism, from this popular belief in the South of India. But as the cultus spread further and wider, it necessarily came into contact with other legends and popular modes of religious worship, and so amongst the \u015aivite worshippers of the North, the idea of a \"Manifested God\"\ntook the form of \u015aiva, and as the Buddhist philosophy developed itself, other forms and characteristics would be attributed to this popular and plastic Deity.\n\nIt is well known that a later development of Buddhism taught that each of the mortal, or M\u0101nushi Buddhas, had a corresponding Dhy\u0101ni Buddha, just as Brahm\u0101 we may say, was developed from Brahm\u0101. Now the Dhy\u0101ni Buddha, corresponding to \u015a\u0101kya Muni, is Amit\u0101bha Buddha, and hence the far extended worship paid to this particular Buddha; for as \u015a\u0101kya Buddha is called the Saviour of our particular Sakwala, so Amit\u0101bha is described as having even a paramount interest in our welfare, and not ours only, but in that of all the infinite Sakwalas composing his \"platform\" of existence (if we may so speak). Hence he is called the \"God above all\" by the Thibetans, and, if not so called, he is so regarded, by Chinese and Japanese Buddhists.\n\nBut in the North of India the theory of each Supreme Being having a female, or \u015aakti, representing the active power of that Being, had developed itself at an early date. Hence we find that the \u015aakti of Brahm\u0101 was V\u0101ch or Sarasvat\u012b. But these names do but represent the power of speech, the connection being, evidently, between the faculty of speech and the hidden mind, of which speech is the exponent. Hence Buddhism (according to its facile character) was soon driven to adopt some similar theory, and as Amit\u0101bha was regarded with supreme devotion, etc., his \u015aakti or active power was at first spoken of as Avalokite\u015bvara, i.e. the manifestation of the Deity, and afterwards indifferently as Kwan Yin or the \"Manifested Voice,\" corresponding to the female power called V\u0101ch or Sarasvat\u012b. Hence we find that Sarasvat\u012b is adored in Thibet as the \u015aakti of Manju\u1e63r\u012b, simply because he, i.e. Manju\u1e63r\u012b, is regarded as the chief divinity and protector of the country; and so also we may reasonably argue that as the belief in Amit\u0101bha spread towards China, and afterwards to Japan, that the worship of Avalokite\u015bvara under the title of Kwan Yin (or V\u0101ch) accompanied it, and has ever after remained attached to it. We\n\n1 Schlagintweit, p. 65 n.\nneed not repeat that the two titles have the same meaning, and that as Sarasvat\u012b was the Goddess of Speech, or as V\u0101ch represented that power, so also that Kwan Yin is but the \"Manifested Voice.\"\n\nHence again this Bodhisattva is nearly always represented in China under a female form, so much so, that to us she is familiarly known as the Goddess of Mercy, simply because when so represented she is the exponent of the character of Buddha, who is always regarded as being principally influenced by the attribute of Love in all he did for the benefit of men.\n\nI have thus endeavoured to trace the origin of the title Kwan Yin, given in China and Japan to the Bodhisattva Avalokite\u015bvara.\n\nI may now say that Kwan Yin is there worshipped under many various shapes. It was my fortune some years ago to live for many months in the town of Hakodadi, in the North of Japan, and there on the different hills that surrounded the town, I found thirty-two images of this Being (called by the Japanese Kan\u014dn), each possessing particular features\u2014one, for instance, with two faces and four arms; another with three faces and six arms, etc.;\u2014and I further discovered that these figures were well recognized models of different idols in the thirty-two chief temples of the country, in which the worship of Kan\u014dn is particularly affected. So, also, in China, Kwan Yin is worshipped under very various shapes\u2014at one time as \"Kwan Yin of the Southern Seas,\" i.e., no doubt, as inhabiting Potalaka (which is in Ceylon), and as such she is adored and invoked by sailors. Then she is worshipped by women as the Goddess of parturition, and so also she is represented, as in the present work, as being possessed of a thousand eyes and a thousand hands, indicating her supreme wisdom and power, to know all things and deliver all men. In the roll which accompanies the Chinese text, are representations of some forms under which Kwan Yin is known to the Chinese. Perhaps the most curious of all is the one in which he is described as the \"Great Manes,\" no doubt referring to the Persian Manes, the founder of the Manich\u00e6an sect. We\nmay gather from these representations the real mode of regarding this cultus: as being in fact adoration paid to every form of Wisdom and Beneficence, idealized under a particular figure and admitted, at an early period, as a proper personification of those attributes.\n\nThe work here translated does not profess to be a version of any Sanskrit original: it forms part of the Imperial collection of Sacred Books, and has a preface written by Yung loh the second of the Ming dynasty, A.D. 1412. It appears to have been re-printed at the Hai chwang Sze, near Canton (where I procured my own copy), in the 6th year of Kea King, i.e., A.D. 1802.\n\nI have been unable to revise the translation, and I am conscious of many faults being contained in it; but should it be considered of sufficient importance, the work of revision might be subsequently attended to, and perhaps the whole rendered more intelligible.\n\nIn the translation I have not hesitated to adopt words commonly understood to represent equivalent expressions in Chinese, as e.g., in rendering the phrase \"the thousand-handed and thousand-eyed Kwan Yin\" by the expression Omniscient and Omnipotent, and also in other cases\u2014in all of which I hope I have not been guided by anything but a wish correctly to render the original.\n\nI have only to add that I have not in the translation written down all the Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012bs, as they are (unless restored to their originals) unmeaning sounds. They are repeated by the priests merely by rote, and with \"no understanding.\" On examination, they are found to be invocations addressed to all the Buddhas, and to the popular idols of India; interspersed with frequent recitation of the words Om, Svah, Sri, &c.\n\nDec. 15, 1865.\nART. XI.\u2014The Hymns of the Gaup\u0101yunas and the Legend of King Asam\u0101ti. By Professor Max M\u00fcller, M.A., Hon. M. R. A. S.\n\nHaving lately received two new MSS. of S\u0101yana's Commentary on the Rig-veda, I thought that a few lines on the character of these MSS., and on the proper use to be made of Sanskrit MSS. in general, might be of some interest both in England and in India. I owe these MSS. to the kindness and enlightened generosity of Dr. Bhao Daji, who is well known to the members of the Royal Asiatic Society, both as an intelligent collector of Indian antiquities, inscriptions, and manuscripts, and as a careful and successful inquirer into the history and chronology of India. I had explained to him and to other friends of mine in India the great difficulties I have to contend with in editing the two final Asht\u0101kas of the Rig-veda. Though I possess nine MSS. of S\u0101yana's Commentary, yet, as I have stated in the prefaces to the four published volumes of the Rig-veda, these nine MSS. are only varieties of three original types, and as the later portions of S\u0101yana's great exegetical work have evidently been much less read and studied in India than the former, the text is frequently in a very corrupt state, and in several passages past all hope of mending. This is the reason why I have waited so long before sending the last two Mandalas of my edition of the Rig-veda to press, particularly as I had some hope of receiving an old and excellent MS. from the South of India. Whenever I heard of the existence of an old or otherwise promising MS. of S\u0101yana, I always sent to my correspondent in India a number of test passages, in order to find out whether the MS. in question contained any independent readings. A collation of three or four passages in which all my MSS. shared exactly the same mistake, was generally sufficient to establish whether or not the new MS. represented an independent family, and a comparison of some other passages in which one of the three families had its peculiar faults\nor omissions, sufficed to show to which of the three the MS. belonged.\n\nIt is well known by this time that a mere collation of MSS. and an accumulation of various readings are of little use for critical purposes. MSS. are copied from one another, and if we have ten MSS. all copied from the same original, the various readings of these MSS. are clearly of no documentary value whatever. It is quite possible that here and there some of the more intelligent copyists may have been struck by the palpable errors of the original before them, and the corrections which they introduced may carry conviction to every reader. Yet, according to the principles of diplomatic criticism so well laid down by Lachmann, and at present adopted by all classical scholars of note, these corrections can claim no more authority than the conjectures of an individual, unless it can be proved, and this is very difficult, that the copyist had before him more than one MS. at the time. The object of diplomatic criticism is not to restore the most correct or the most plausible text, but that text, with all its mistakes and omissions, which a comparison of all the MSS. at our disposal places within our reach. Hence our first object in examining and collating MSS. must be to establish their respective worth and weight as witnesses. We ought to be most careful not to allow ourselves to be swayed either by the beautiful writing or by the age of any MS. Though the age of a MS. is always a matter of considerable importance, it happens not unfrequently that a modern copy possesses greater documentary value than an older copy, for the simple reason that it was copied straight from a MS. of greater age than any which we have access to. This is the case, for instance, with regard to the Ca. MS. of S\u0101yana, which, although the oldest, is of far less value critically than the modern MS. A. Colebr. Let it once be established that out of ten MSS., B, C, D, are copied from A; that E, F, G, H, I, can all be traced back to a common source; and that J stands by itself:\u2014then the office of an editor is simply to establish for each doubtful passage the reading of A, the reading that will account for the variations, if any, in E, F, G, H, I, and the reading of J. To give one of these readings in the printed text and the others in the notes, is all\nthat can be required of him. After confronting in numerous places the evidence of three witnesses, it will, generally, be possible to arrive at an estimate of their respective value, and it is no doubt the greatest triumph of diplomatic criticism if it is possible, by conclusive evidence, to establish the paramount authority of one among three or more apparently independent traditions. In classical philology, where we have mostly to deal with MSS. which directly or indirectly must be traced back to the original MS. of an individual author, the establishment of one supreme authority is an object never to be lost sight of. In India, where the individual author is frequently merged in a school, and where oral teaching opens, even in modern times, so wide a door to disturbing influences, we must be prepared to arrive in the end at several independent authorities, generally localised in the principal seats of Brahmanic learning. Thus, although there may have been one original text of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, it would clearly be in vain to attempt to restore that text by subjecting the two traditional texts to an eclectic criticism. All that an editor can do, is to give either the one or the other text according to the MSS. and to the commentaries, belonging to the one or the other school. The same applies to literary works which are ascribed to individual authors, as the play of \u015aakuntal\u0101, ascribed to K\u0101lid\u0101sa. Here, too, the two traditional texts or 'recensions' must be kept apart, though, in this case, it is less difficult to decide which of the two is the original.\n\nWith regard to the text of the Vedas, the Brahmans themselves recognised the existence of independent traditions or branches (\u015b\u0101kh\u0101s); they chronicled the various readings of the hymns and even of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and this at so early a date, that we cannot ascribe these variations to the negligence of scribes, but only to the influence of oral tradition, kept up in different families and schools. What applies to the text of the Vedas, applies with equal, or even greater, force to their commentaries. Although the commentary of S\u0101yana was composed as late as the fifteenth century of our era, and although I possess one MS., written not more than about a hundred years later, yet that MS. (Ca.) cannot claim the supreme authority, which for instance the codex Laurentianus A.\nclaims among the MSS. of Sophocles. The MS. of Colebrooke (A 2), although of a much more modern date, about 1761 A.D., represents in innumerable passages a less corrupt and less mangled text; at all events a text which could not possibly have passed through that phase which is exhibited in Ca. I have repeatedly, in the prefaces to my edition of the Rig-veda, explained the principles by which I have been guided in restoring the text of S\u0101yana. Having to supply a text that should be practically useful, I have had to deviate from the strict principles of diplomatic criticism, so far as to place manifest blunders, even when they were supported by all the MSS., in the notes. I have chiefly done so when none of the readings of the MSS. would have yielded any sense whatever, or, when I was enabled, by consulting the originals from which S\u0101yana quoted, to support my corrections by independent authority. I have on two or three occasions allowed an explanation, though it appeared in one or two MSS. only, and was clearly a marginal note of a later student, and not S\u0101yana\u2019s own, to form part of the printed text, simply because I imagined it would be useful, and might be passed over if given only in the notes. Deviations like these from the strict rules followed by Lachmann, Haupt, and others, have always been noted in the Varietas Lectionis. I do not wish to defend them even in the edition of a work like S\u0101yana\u2019s Commentary, and I have carefully avoided them in the later volumes.\n\nIn order to show the position which the two new MSS. of S\u0101yana, lately received from Dr. Bhao Daji, hold in the well-established pedigree of S\u0101yana\u2019s MSS., I have chosen a passage where S\u0101yana gives a long extract from a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a. These extracts are generally full of blunders, and unless they can be verified in the original from which they are taken, they are very troublesome to an editor. Their usefulness, however, for determining the relative position of our MSS. is all the greater, because the scribes, who had little difficulty in correcting blunders in the uniform and business-like style of S\u0101yana, found it more difficult to deal with the antiquated words and grammatical forms of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, and therefore contented themselves generally with copying letter by letter the original before them. It will be seen at one glance, by\ncomparing the texts of the various MSS. in this passage, that of the two MSS. lent to me by Dr. Bhao Daji, the one which I mark B.D. belongs to the B. class, the other which I mark A.D. belongs to the A. class. The first MS. (B.D.) is written in a beautiful hand, with large and distinct letters, and contains both text and commentary. It has no date, at least not in that portion of it which I was able to examine. The other MS. (A.D.) is likewise written in a very distinct hand, but the letters are smaller and less carefully formed. In the centre of each page, space is left for inserting the text, but it is only in the sixth Asht\u0101ka, and in the seventh as far as fol. 51, that the text has been added. In the eighth Asht\u0101ka the commentary occupies the whole page, no space being left for the text. At the end of the eighth Asht\u0101ka a date is given, 1813, as it would seem, of Samvat, i.e. 1757 A.D. The name of the writer is not clear, but it may be meant for Sad\u0101sin\u012b, the son of Jagann\u0101tha. Whoever the writer was, he lived, like the writer of Colebrooke's MS., at Benares, and this so far confirms my opinion that the A. class represents the Benares text, in the same manner as the B. class represents the scholastic tradition of Bombay and Poonah, and the C. class, at least in the earlier Asht\u0101kas, that of Calcutta. In order to explain the arrangement of the following extracts, I have only to add that the first class of MSS. comprises, besides the MSS. of Dr. Bhao Daji and Colebrooke, the two C. MSS., which, as I pointed out in the preface to the second volume of my edition (p. viii.), are in the later Asht\u0101kas derived from an A. source. Taylor's MS. too, which in the earlier Asht\u0101kas belonged to the B. class, and was therefore marked B. 4., belongs in the eighth Asht\u0101ka to the A. class. How this came to pass is easily explained by the fact that these MSS. were copied from different originals lent to Taylor, Mill, and Wilson by persons residing in different parts of India. The second, or C. class, is now represented by one MS. only, the oldest hitherto known in Europe, which I continue to quote as Ca. In the third, or B. class, B. 1. is the MS. of Stevenson; B. 2. the MS. of Burnouf, as copied by me in 1847; B. 3. is the new copy mentioned by me in the preface to the second volume, now in the hands of Dr. Goldst\u00fccker, and kindly collated by him for\nme; B.M. is a fragment of the last Ash\u1e6daka which I received from Dr. Haug; B.D. is the MS. lent me by Dr. Bhao Daji. The last line gives the text as it may be re-established from an intercomparison of the three families of \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a's MSS. I do not maintain that it represents exactly what \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a wrote, still less that it gives the correct text of the \u015a\u0101ty\u0101yanaka. It is simply impossible, with the MSS. at our disposal, to restore a text that might claim to be identical with \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a's own writing. All that can be claimed for our text is that it represents \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a's writing as far as it can now be restored with the help of our MSS. It gives what is obtainable with a strict observance of the rules of diplomatic criticism. It is not only possible, but extremely likely, that if to-morrow we obtained \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a's own manuscript, whether from the ruins of Vidy\u0101nagara, where a complete collection of his works is said to have been buried, or from the MS. which Dr. Haug saw at Ahmadabad, and to which he assigns the date of Samvat 1526, A.D. 1470, we should find slight variations between \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a's original and the nearest approach to it that is within our reach. It is still more likely that if a MS. of the \u015a\u0101ty\u0101yanaka were recovered in India, there might be between it and our own restored text, considerable discrepancy. The students of \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a's Commentary know that this is frequently the case when \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a quotes from Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and S\u016btras, of which we possess both MSS. and printed texts; and he has his choice between supposing that \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a quoted from memory and without caring about minute accuracy, or that he quoted from a s\u0101kh\u0101 different from that which is before us. It would be easy, no doubt, to improve the text of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, as here printed, by conjecture. But those who know the mischief done by conjectural criticism in classical scholarship, will deprecate, most strongly, any countenance given to it by Sanskrit scholars. It may be truly said that the chief business of modern critics is to cleanse the text of the classics from the improvements introduced by the ingenious editors of the last three centuries, and we ought not to neglect this lesson in preparing our own editiones principes. Let an editor give what there is, and let the commentator and translator say what might be, or what ought to be.\nA.D. \u0917\u094b\u092a\u093e\u092f\u0928\u093e

MSS. differ from the A. and Ca. MSS. by putting \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093f instead of \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093f. The repetition of \u092f\u093e\u092e\u093e\u091a\u0928\u093f is a slip of the writer of A.D.\n\nAll B. MSS. have \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f right, while the A. MSS. have the mistake \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f, which reappears in the still more corrupt Ca. \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f.\n\nAll the B. MSS. blunder in the third vowel of \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f; the A. MSS. are right; Ca. blunders in leaving out the anusv\u0101ra.\n\nThe patronymic name of Asam\u0101ti, which I suppose to be \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093f, is corrupt in all MSS. The A. MSS. agree in \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093f except B. 4, which has been corrected, and C. W., which has the slight variation of \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093f; while the B. MSS. support throughout at all events the v\u1e5bddhi vowel of the third syllable, which also appears in the faulty reading of Ca. B. 1 and 2 are more closely united, and so are B. 3, B.M., and B.D.; the former giving \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093f or \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093f, the latter \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093f. See R.V. x, 60, 5. On Asam\u0101ti, see Lassen, Indische Alterthumskunde (first edition), vol. i. p. xiii. note 31; Colebrooke, Misc. Essays, i. p. 25.\n\nB.M. stands alone in furnishing the right reading \u0935\u0943\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f, the correction probably of an individual copyist, unsupported even by the nearest MS. B.D. The short vowel in the second syllable is equally peculiar to B.M.\n\nThe right reading \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f is nearly preserved in A. Other MSS. belonging to this class, C. M. and A.D. slide into \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f. B. 4 seems to give \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f, and this is the reading of Ca. The B. MSS. add to it a new mistake \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f.\n\nThe A. class and Ca. have throughout the right reading \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f, followed by \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f, which I think is meant for \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f. B. 1 and 2 have taken \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f as one word, and left \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f without the \u091a, thus rendering it unintelligible. B. 3, B.M. and B.D. have the same lacuna.\n\nThe patronymic has again puzzled the scribes. The A. and Ca. MSS. now agree in \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093f or \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093f. B. 4 brings in the long \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f in \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f, which seems to come from B. unless it is accidental. B. 1 and 2 have \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f and \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f, to which they inclined before; while B. 3, B.M., and B.D. approach to their former blunder \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f.\n\nThe anusv\u0101ra in \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u093f is the characteristic mark of the A. class. B 1 and 2 are held together by their common lacuna; B. 3, B.M. and B.D. by the anusv\u0101ra on the second syllable.\n\nThe spelling of \u091a\u0941\u092a\u091a\u0941\u092a\u0903 or \u091a\u0941\u092a\u091a\u0941\u092a\u0903 seems to point to \u091a\u0941\u092a\u091a\u0941\u092a\u0903: The verb \u091a\u0941\u092a\u091a\u0941\u092a\u0903, to dwell, may be construed with a locative, in the sense of \u201cto dwell with.\u201d\n\n\u091a\u0941\u092a\u091a\u0941\u092a\u0903 is probably intended for \u091a\u0941\u092a\u091a\u0941\u092a\u0903. The readings of the different MSS. might seem to suggest \u091a\u0941\u092a\u091a\u0941\u092a\u0903 or \u091a\u0941\u092a\u091a\u0941\u092a\u0903, but I\nprefer \u091a\u0941\u0930\u092e\u093e\u091a\u0940 because this word is used in the T\u00e2ndya-br\u0101hma\u1e47a, xiii. 12. There we find two M\u0101ya's, evidently treated as females, but acting a similar part to that assigned to the two priests in our legends. I subjoin the text and S\u0101yana's Commentary (MS.

In our passage, on the contrary, \u0935\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0924\u0915\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0940 must be a masculine in the nominative, and would therefore lead us to suppose that \u0935\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0924 and \u091a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092f were the names of the two sorcerers. They occur again as male demons in the \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a I. 1, 4, 14, and in the B\u1e5bhaddevat\u0101. S\u0101yana in his commentary on the \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a explains \u0935\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0924\u0915\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0940 by \u0935\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0924\u0915\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093f\u092f \u0926\u093e\u0935\u0941\u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u094b\u0939\u093f\u0924\u0940 \u092c\u092d\u0941\u0935\u0941\u0903\u0964 In another passage, the T\u00e2ndya (xiii. 7) uses the fem. termination of the dual, (\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0916\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u093f for \u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0916\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u093f) for the masc. Here, however, the commentator calls it \u0935\u093f\u0937\u0947\u092a\u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0916\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u0903.\n\n11 The A. MSS. agree on \u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0943, i.e. \u0924\u0947 \u0939\u0943, for the \u092e of B. 4 is from the margin. The B. MSS. on the contrary all point to \u0924\u0938\u094d\u092e\u0903.\n\n12 \u0935\u093f\u0927\u093e\u092f\u094b\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0903 marks the A. and Ca. MSS.; \u0935\u093f\u0927\u093e\u092f\u094b\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0903 the B. MSS.\n\n13 The A. MSS. agree in \u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u091a\u093e\u0924\u092e\u094d, instead of \u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0902 which is intended by the B. MSS. B. 4 has the B. reading, and alone of all MSS. supplies the reading \u091a\u093e\u0924\u092e\u094d. Ca. mixes up the two readings.\n\n14 In the lacuna after \u092a\u0930\u093e and in \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0935\u093f we have marked features of the entire B. class. B. 4 has its own peculiar mistake, \u092a\u0930\u093e\u0935\u092d\u0941\u0935\u0941\u0903; which could only refer to the two Asuras, while it is meant for the Ikshv\u0101kus, i.e. Asam\u0101ti and the Rathapros\u1e6dhas.\nThe A. class is again marked by retaining the correct \u091a\u093e\u092e\u0924\u092a\u0923 though not always clearly written, whereas the B. MSS. have clearly \u091a\u093e\u092e\u0924\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924.\n\nThe B. MSS. again agree in the mistake \u091c\u094b\u092a\u093e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e.\n\nThe B. class is sharply marked by the lacuna of \u091a\u093e\u092e\u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b and again by \u091a\u093e\u092e\u093f\u092a\u0924\u093f instead of \u091a\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0924\u092a\u0924\u093f, and the short vowel in \u0935\u0930\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0935\u094b.\n\nThe omission of \u091a\u093e shows the close relationship of B. 3, B.M. & B.D.\n\nThe original reading was probably \u091a\u093e\u092e\u0935\u0947\u0926\u0903; cf. Satapatha-br\u0101hma\u1e47a, I. 1, 4, 15, \u091a\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f \u0926\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094b\u0927\u093e\u0930\u092f\u0947.\n\nThe mistake \u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0935\u094b in A.D., A., C.M., and C.W. indicates a closer relationship between these three MSS.\n\nThe lacuna after \u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0935\u094b in the B. MSS. is important; likewise the coincidences between B. 1 and B. 2 on one side, and between B 3, B.M. and B.D. on the other.\n\n\u091a\u0941\u092c\u0941\u0902\u0917\u0940\u0903 is a mistake that distinguishes the B. MSS. from the A. and Ca.MSS. \u0938\u0935\u0927\u093f in C.M. is a mere lapsus calami, repeated in C.W. So is \u0928\u0940\u092a\u093e\u0903 in A.D. and B.4, and again \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u0926\u0903. Is \u091a\u093e\u092e\u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b intended for \u091a\u093e\u092e\u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b?\n\nThe A. MSS. agree in \u091a\u093e\u092e\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u092e\u093f\u0903 instead of \u091a\u093e\u092e\u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0903. Ca. stands alone with \u091a\u093e\u092e\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u092e\u093f\u0903, while the B. MSS. just miss the right reading by the omission of one \u0924\u0903. B. 3 has \u091a\u093e\u092e\u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0903, where the long \u0906 is a blunder of the copyist.\n\nHaving thus established the fact which I wished to establish, viz., that at present, in spite of repeated researches set on foot by my friends in India, no MSS. of S\u0101yana\u2019s have been discovered that could claim to be anterior to the branching off of the three great families, A.B.C., I only intended in conclusion once more and in this public manner to convey my thanks to Dr. Bhao Daji for his great kindness, and to express a hope that other countrymen of his might follow his example, and take an active and enlightened interest in researches concerning the ancient literature, religion, and history of their noble country. But as I have once touched on the hymns of the Gaup\u0101yanas, and on the legend of king Asam\u0101ti, quoted by S\u0101yana in explanation of the four hymns of the Rig-veda (x. 57\u201360), I gladly add a few extracts from my manuscript notes on these hymns themselves, hymns which are in many respects of peculiar interest to the student of the Veda. In offering a double translation of these hymns, one according to S\u0101yana, the other according to my own view, I need not enter fully into the principles which I think ought to be followed\nin the interpretation of the hymns of the Rig-veda. I have frequently stated my opinions on this subject in the prefaces to my edition of the Rig-veda, in the specimens that I have given in my History of Sanskrit Literature, and in my Essay on the Funeral Ceremonies of the Brahmans, and I may have to defend these opinions again when I come to publish my translation of the Rig-veda. The following is a specimen of what I intend to give in that translation, though, as the hymns of the Gaup\u00e2yanas occur in the last Manjala, I have here to take account of M. Langlois' translation only, and have not to examine, as in the earlier books, the valuable explanations proposed by other scholars, such as Rosen, N\u00e8ve, Benfey, Wilson, Kuhn, Regnier, Aufrecht, Muir, and others. Whenever it is possible to ascertain from his Dictionary the opinion of my learned friend, Professor Roth, with regard to the meaning of certain words in certain passages, I have to take careful account of his interpretations, and I hope to be able to avail myself in like manner of Professor Goldst\u00fccker's Lexicon and of the Vedic Glossary and translations promised by Professor Aufrecht. All I need say at present is that I am convinced as strongly as ever that all interpretation of the Vedic hymns must begin with an examination of the traditional explanations collected by S\u00e2yana. No one can doubt that the commentary of S\u00e2yana is the result of a long line of scholastic tradition, gathered up by S\u00e2yana, but the first fibres of which can easily be traced back to K\u00e2t-y\u00e2yana, Saunaka, Y\u00e2ska, and the authorities quoted in the Br\u00e2hma\u00f1as. We may be certain that S\u00e2yana does not invent traditions; he hardly ventures to choose between them, but gives them as he finds them, unconcerned about their palpable contradictions. Thus, in our case, the traditions of the Brahmans, with regard to the four hymns in question, are by no means uniform, though they all agree in giving to the four hymns (x. 57\u201360) an historical character. How the orthodox Brahmans can reconcile these allusions to historical personages and events with the pre-Adamite or pre-M\u00e2navite character which they claim for the Veda, it is difficult to understand. In other cases they have tried to give to proper names occurring in the hymns or Br\u00e2hma\u00f1as an allegorical character, but, as far\nas I know, they seem to have made no such attempt with the names of king Asam\u0101ti and his priest Subandhu. But, however that may be, the important point to us is this, that as far as we can trace back the exegetical tradition of the Brahmanic schools, we find that these four hymns are grouped together, and are supposed to allude to certain historical events. As the simplest account of these events is given in the Sarv\u0101nu-krama of K\u0101ty\u0101yana, it will be best to begin with this.\n\nAccording to K\u0101ty\u0101yana, then, these four hymns were seen, i.e. composed, by the Gaup\u0101yanas, the same Rishis to whom four other lines are ascribed by K\u0101ty\u0101yana in Rig-veda, v. 24. In that passage K\u0101ty\u0101yana calls them Gaup\u0101yanas or Laup\u0101yanas,\u00b9 and gives their names as Bandhu, Subandhu, \u015arutabandhu, and Viprabandhu. What K\u0101ty\u0101yana tells us in explanation of the events that called forth the four hymns of the tenth Mandala, is simply this: \u201cKing Asam\u0101ti, of the race of Ikshv\u0101ku, left the Gaup\u0101yanas, Bandhu, etc., who had been his chief priests, and selected two wizards whom he considered better, or the very best that he could get. Then the others were angry and used incantations against the king. Thereupon the two wizards attacked\u00b2 the vital spirits of Subandhu. Then his three brothers recited\u00b3 the G\u0101yatr\u012b-hymn (x. 57) to obtain a blessing.\u2074 Afterwards they recited the next Anushtubh-hymn (x. 58), in order to cause the soul (of Subandhu) to return. In the next hymn (x. 59) they recited four verses to drive away Niriti,\u2075 and in the fourth they likewise praised Soma. In the two next following verses they praised the divine Asuniti (fem.) in order to remove Mrityu or death; in the seventh verse they invoked certain deities by name, and in the remaining verses Dy\u0101vap\u1e5bthiv\u012b (heaven and earth); likewise Indra in the first line of the tenth verse. Then follows the Anushtubh-hymn (x. 60) in which they praised Asam\u0101ti in four verses, and in the fifth, Indra. In the sixth verse their mother, the sister of Agastya, praised the king. With the others they invoked\n\n\u00b9 The name of Laup\u0101yana receives no further explanation. It may be mentioned, however, that Lop\u0101mudr\u0101 is the name of the wife of Agastya (R.V. i, 179), and that Agastya is quoted in these hymns as the ancestor, it would seem, of the race.\n\n\u00b2 \u0906\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0927\u093f\u092a\u0924\u093f: \u0906\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0927\u093f\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0964\n\n\u00b3 \u0905\u092e\u094d\u0930\u093e, \u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0938\u0932\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0964\n\n\u2074 S\u0101yana has \u091a\u0935\u093f\u0928\u093e\u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0938\u094d\u092e\u0942\u0924\u0947\u0964\n\n\u2075 Niriti, according to S\u0101yana, removes the vital spirits from the body.\nthe life of Subandhu, and with the last they touched him after he had recovered consciousness.\"\n\nS\u0101ya\u1e47a follows in general the tradition of K\u0101ty\u0101yana, but he likewise takes some particular points from other sources, from the \u015a\u0101ty\u0101yanaka and the Brihaddevat\u0101. The \u015a\u0101ty\u0101yanaka is one of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as very frequently quoted by S\u0101ya\u1e47a, but unfortunately not yet recovered in manuscript. The text, as restored above from a comparison of the principal MSS., is not always clear, but as far as it is possible to make it out, the tradition, as there given, seems to have been as follows:\n\n\"The Gaup\u0101yanas had come to Asam\u0101ti R\u0101thapraush\u1e6dha. They had performed a Sattra sacrifice in Kh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava. Then two demoniacal wizards, Kil\u0101ta and Akuli, dwelt with Asam\u0101ti R\u0101thapraush\u1e6dha. The two Asuras cooked their porridge without putting it into the fire, and then the meat on the fire.\u00b9 The Ikshv\u0101kus having burnt their food, failed. The oblations of the Gaup\u0101yanas burnt Asam\u0101ti R\u0101thapraush\u1e6dha. He said to those two, Kil\u0101ta and Akuli, 'These oblations of the Gaup\u0101yanas burn me.' The two said, 'Of that we two indeed are the healers, we two are the penance. We shall so arrange that these do not burn.' Then the two, going off, and offering the soul of Subandhu Gaup\u0101yana, who was asleep and unconscious, placed it inside the sacrificial ring.\"\u00b2 Another extract from the \u015a\u0101ty\u0101yanaka follows at the seventh verse of the last hymn: \"Then they praised Agni with the Dvipada-hymn.\u00b3 Agni being praised, approached, and having approached, he said, 'With what desire did you come?' They said, 'Let us obtain again the spirit of Subandhu.' He said, 'That spirit is inside the sacrificial ring, take it.'\"\n\nHere then we see that some sacrificial minutiae have been added, of which the Sarv\u0101nukrama takes no notice. Though the language of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a is by no means clear, yet it would seem that its author knew nothing of any incantations\n\n\u00b9 This translation is very doubtful, and the text decidedly incorrect. \u0936\u0941\u0930\u0941 might be taken as a nominative dual, but the use of the particle \u0936\u0941\u0930\u0941 is not in accordance with the ordinary style of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as. We must wait for the help of other MSS.\n\n\u00b2 This refers to the hymn R.V. v. 24.\nbeing used by the Gaup\u00e2yanas against King Asam\u00e2ti, unless\nthe same idea is expressed by the words, \"the oblations of the\nGaup\u00e2yanas burn me.\" The Ikshv\u00e2kus, i.e. the people of\nAsam\u00e2ti, according to the \u015a\u00e2ty\u00e2yana\u015baka, simply made a mis-\ntake at the sacrifice and burnt their food in the fire. It\nis not even said that this failure was caused by the Gaup\u00e2-\nyanas, as priests of Asam\u00e2ti. But after it has happened,\nAsam\u00e2ti complains to the two wizards that the oblations of the\nGaup\u00e2yanas burn or hurt him. Thereupon the wizards seem to\nhave sacrificed Subandhu, or to have placed his spirit inside\nthe sacrificial ring, whatever that may mean. The Gaup\u00e2-\nyanas, in order to save the life of their brother, invoked Agni,\nwho gave it back to them from within the sacrificial enclosure.\n\nA third, and again somewhat different, account is given in\nthe B\u1e5bhaddevat\u00e2:\n\n```\n\u0936\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0932\u092e\u093e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0938\u0902\u092f\u0941\u0924\u0947 \u0935\u0930\u0941\u0923\u093e\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092e\u0947 \u0917\u0943\u0939\u0941\u0903\u0964\n\u0938\u0902\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e\u091a\u094d\u091b \u0935\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092f \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0923\u093e\u0902\u092d\u093f\u0924\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u091a\u0964\n\u091c\u0940\u0935\u093e\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0903 \u0938\u0941\u092c\u0927\u094d\u0935\u094b\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093e \u092e\u0928\u0938\u0903 \u0915\u0943\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0903\u0964\n\u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0938\u092e\u093e\u0902\u0924\u0930\u093f\u0924\u0947\u093d\u0932\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0915\u094b \u0930\u091a\u094d\u091a\u092e\u094b\u0903 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u094b\u093d\u0939\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0964\n\u0915\u0941\u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937 \u092c\u0941\u0927\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092d\u0942\u0924\u093f\u0928\u0902 \u0939\u0943\u0926\u0947\u0928\u093e \u091a\u0948\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941\u0903\u0964\n\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094b\u093d\u0915\u0941\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f \u0928\u093e\u092e \u0924\u0924\u094b \u092e\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0935\u093f\u0928\u0940 \u0926\u093f\u0935\u0940\u0964\n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0924\u093f: \u092a\u0941\u0930\u094b \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0947\u0923 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0924\u0940 \u0924\u0940 \u0939\u093f \u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924\u0903\u0964\n```\n\n1 The text is printed from a MS. kindly presented to me by Dr. Bhao Daji,\nand which I mark B.

He, from pain and violence, staggered and fell. Then these two, after plucking out his soul, went to the king. Then after Subandhu had fallen and given up his spirit, all the three brothers, the Gaup\u00e2yanas, recited together a blessing, beginning with the word Mo (x. 57); and in order to cause his spirit to return they sang the hymn beginning with Yad (x. 58). And after that, in order to effect a cure, they recited the hymn beginning with Pra t\u00e2ri (x. 59). The first three verses in that hymn are meant to drive away Nirriti; the three quarters beginning with Mo shu (x. 59, 4) are addressed to Soma, the last quarter to Nirriti, and the whole verse is therefore addressed to Soma and Nirriti. In the next two verses Asam\u00e2ti is praised, but Y\u00e2ska holds the last quarter of the sixth verse to be addressed to Anumati. The earth, heaven, Soma, P\u00fbshan, the air, Pathy\u00e2, and Svasti, these are praised together in the verse beginning with Punar nakh, in order to give comfort to Subandhu. The three verses (8\u201310) beginning with \u0160am are addressed to the two Rodasi, but in the verse beginning with \u0160am (10) half the verse is addressed to Indra. And they praised the Rodasi in order to destroy rapas, and the word rapas is used for sin and evil. Then with the four verses beginning with \u00c2 (x. 60, 1\u20134) they praised the Aikshv\u00e2ka (Asam\u00e2ti), and having praised him, they invoked blessings upon him by the verse Indra kshatr\u00e2 (x. 60, 5). Their mother also praised that king with the verse beginning with Agastyasya (x. 60, 6). Then, after thus being praised, the king felt ashamed, and went to the Gaup\u00e2yanas, and they praised also Agni with the Dvipada-hymn, as it is found among the Atris, i.e. in the Atrimandala (R.V. v. 24). And Agni said to them: \u2018This spirit of Subandhu has been kept inside the sacrificial ring by me, being a well-wisher also of this Ikshv\u00e2ku (Asam\u00e2ti).\u2019 And\n\n\u00b9 This change into doves is not mentioned elsewhere, and in a passage of the commentary on the Sarv\u00e2nukrama we read \u091a \u092d\u093e\u0935\u093e\u0935\u093f\u0939\u093f\u0924\u092a\u0941\u0930\u094b\u0939\u093f\u0924\u0940 \u0915\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937-\u092a\u0940 \u0924\u0940 \u092d\u0942\u0932\u0947\u0928\u093f \u092c\u0941\u0939\u0926\u0903\u0964\nhaving given the spirit to Subandhu, and having said, Live!, Agni, praised by the Gaup\u0101yanas, and pleased, went towards heaven. Then these were delighted and called the spirit of Subandhu with the verse Ayam m\u0101t\u0101 (x. 60, 7), pointing to the body of Subandhu that was lying on the ground. And they sang the rest of the hymn in order to confirm his mind, and they touched him separately, after he had recovered his spirit, with the verses beginning with Ayam (x. 60, 12).\u201d\n\nWhat is chiefly important in this version of the legend is the transformation of the two wizards into doves, always supposing that the text is correct. It should be observed also that the Brihaddevat\u0101 knows of the spirit of Subandhu having been preserved inside the sacrificial ring, and of Agni restoring it, after he had been praised with the four verses given in the Atri-mandala. If this be so, if the four verses of the hymn (R.V. v. 24) were recited by the three brothers, before the resuscitation of the fourth brother, Subandhu, it would be difficult to reconcile with this the statement of K\u0101ty\u0101yana, who says that the four brothers saw or composed the four verses of that hymn.\n\nWe now come to the Nitimanjar\u012b which derives two of its moral maxims from our four hymns. The first is that one ought not to trust in kings; the second that there is no friend like a brother.\n\nI give the extracts of this little work as they stand in my MS. in order to show how the work has been put together.

May we obtain both, (life and our senses).\"\n\n6. \"O Soma, may we (Bandhu and the rest) keeping our mind on thy service and on thy members, obtain with our offspring, both (life and our senses).\"\n\nHymn 58.\n\n1. \"O dead man, thy soul which went far away to Yama the son of Vivasvat, we turn it back, here to dwell and to live.\"\n\n2. \"O Subandhu, thy soul which went far away to heaven and earth, we turn it back, here to dwell and to live.\"\n\n3. \"O Subandhu, thy soul which went far away to the four-cornered earth, we turn it back, here to dwell and to live.\"\n\n4. \"O Subandhu, thy soul which went far away to the four great regions, we turn it back, here to dwell and to live.\"\n\n5. \"O Subandhu, thy soul which went far away to the watery sea, we turn it back, here to dwell and to live.\"\n\n6. \"O Subandhu, thy soul which went far away to the onward moving splendours, we turn it back, here to dwell and to live.\"\n\n7. \"O Subandhu, thy soul which went far away into the water and the shrubs, we turn it back, here to dwell and to live.\"\n\n\u00b9 S\u0101yana must have read \u0905\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0903 instead of \u0905\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0903;\n8. \"O Subandhu, thy soul which went far away into the sun and into the dawn, we turn it back, here to dwell and to live.\"\n\n9. \"O Subandhu, thy soul which went far away to the great mountains, we turn it back, here to dwell and to live.\"\n\n10. \"O Subandhu, thy soul which went far away into the whole world, we turn it back, here to dwell and to live.\"\n\n11. \"O Subandhu, thy soul which went far away to distant distances, we turn it back, here to dwell and to live.\"\n\n12. \"O Subandhu, thy soul which went far away into the past and into the future, we turn it back, here to dwell and to live.\"\n\nHymn 59.\n\n1. \"May the life (of Subandhu) be increased so as to be longer and newer; as two men standing on a chariot (are increased or advanced) by an active (charioteer). Thus he (Subandhu) having fallen (from life), increases his object (his life).

May Soma give again our body, may P\u016bshan give speech, and what is bliss!\"\n\n8. \"May the great Heaven and Earth, the mother of the sacrifice, give a blessing to Subandhu. Whatever evil there is, may they both carry it off! O heaven, o earth! if there is patience! O Subandhu, may no evil whatever hurt thee really!\"\n\n9. \"From Heaven medicines descend, double and three-fold; (i.e. the two Asvins, and the three goddesses, Il\u0101, Sarasvat\u012b, and Bh\u0101rat\u012b); a single medicine walks on earth.

Whatever evil there is, may they both carry it off! O heaven, o patient earth! O Subandhu, may no evil whatever hurt thee really!\"\n\n**Hymn 60.**\n\n1. \"We (Bandhu and the rest) bringing praise, have come to a man (viz. king Asam\u0101ti)\\(^1\\) of bright aspect, praised by the great.\"\n\n2. \"To Asam\u0101ti, the smasher (of enemies), the brilliant, (like unto) a conquering chariot, born of the race of Bhajeratha,\\(^2\\) the lord of the brave.\"\n\n3. \"He who by fight overcomes men, like oxen, whether he has a dagger, or whether he has no dagger.\"\n\n4. \"The king of this country, Ikshv\u0101ku, thrives in his work, rich, and killing his enemies. His five tribes are as if in heaven.\"\n\n5. \"O Indra, keep the powers with Asam\u0101ti Rathaproshtha, as thou keepest the sun in heaven to be seen.\"\n\n6. The mother of Bandhu and the rest, the sister of Agastya, says: \"O King Asam\u0101ti, for the sake of Agastya's\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Or, we have come to a country belonging to the life-leading goddess, to Asuniti; not to Asam\u0101ti, as might be expected.\n\n\\(^2\\) Or, conquering an enemy called Bhajeratha.\nnephews, harness the two red horses. Conquer all the miserly merchants!\"\n\n7. Bandhu and the other brothers say: \"This is the mother, this the father, this life-giver has come. O Subandhu (who art now in a cover of life), this (thy body) is thy means of moving.\\(^1\\) Come here, come out (of thy cover of life)!\"\n\n8. \"As they tie a yoke with a rope that it may hold, so has Agni held thy soul (in the cover), for life, not for death, ay, for safety.\"\n\n9. \"As this great earth has held these trees, so has Agni held thy soul, for life, not for death, ay, for safety.\"\n\n10. \"I have brought the soul of Subandhu from Yama, the son of Vivasvat, for life, not for death, ay, for safety.\"\n\n11. \"The wind blows down, the sun shines down, the cow gives milk down; may thy sin go down!\"\n\n12. The brothers touching the reviving Subandhu with their hands say: \"This my hand is blessed; this my hand is more blessed; this my hand holds all healing herbs; this has a happy touch.\"\n\nThe translation of these four hymns is a fair specimen of what a translation of the Rig-veda would be, if we followed strictly and unhesitatingly the explanation given by S\u0101yana. Many verses would give a perfectly satisfactory sense, nor is there any necessity for going beyond S\u0101yana's interpretation, whenever that interpretation satisfies both the rules of grammar and the requirements of common sense. Three-fourths of the Veda may thus be translated by anybody who can understand S\u0101yana's commentary. But there occur from time to time lines and verses where S\u0101yana's interpretation offends clearly both against grammar and against sense. Here the fault must either rest with S\u0101yana or with the text of the Veda. The poets of the Veda, who strictly observe a grammar of their own, and who in by far the greater part of their hymns utter thoughts that are both intelligible and coherent, cannot be supposed suddenly to have forgotten themselves,\n\n\\(^1\\) Or, o Subandhu, this is thy mother, this the father, this thy son, come here; all have come, full of grief.\nand to have set grammar and sense at defiance. In such cases we must see whether their words do not lend themselves to a different interpretation from that given by S\u0101yana. Sometimes the misapprehensions of S\u0101yana are palpable. Thus in hymn 57, 5, it is clear that S\u0101yana mistakes manah for jana\u1e25. Regardless of the accent, he takes pitara\u1e25 for an nominative, and he does further violence to grammar by making pitara\u1e25 an apposition to jana\u1e25. Instead of translating, as he does, \u201cMay the assembly of our fathers and the assembly of the gods give us life,\u201d it is clear that we ought to translate, even though adopting the rest of S\u0101yana\u2019s Commentary, \u201cO fathers, may the assembly of the gods give back our soul.\u201d The following words are likewise wrongly rendered by S\u0101yana. He takes j\u012bvam for life, and vr\u0101tam for the collection of the five senses. J\u012bva, no doubt, means life, and vr\u0101ta mean a collection. But, first of all, we should then expect the two words to be joined by cha; or, if that might be passed, the difficulty would still remain that vr\u0101ta never means the collection of the five senses, but simply collection, mass, multitude. This can be proved by many passages, such as R.V. i. 163, 8; iii. 26, 6; v. 53, 11; vi. 75, 9; x. 34, 8, and 12. It is true the phrase j\u012bvam vr\u0101tam sahemahi, does not occur again, but as there are many passages in which j\u012bva is used as an adjective, in the sense of living, and as j\u012bvaloka is used in the sense of the world of the living, everything seems to favour the natural explanation of the last line, \u201cLet us join the living multitudes.\u201d Then the question arises, can sahemahi be used with the accusative? It generally governs the instrumental, as R.V. i. 116, 17; 136, 6; 152, 1; 183, 2; 185, 9; ii. 8, 6; v. 50, 2; x. 7, 1; 64, 11; 106, 10. But there are numerous passages where it governs the accusative, such as i. 136, 3; 180, 1; ii. 41, 6; iii. 39, 3; 52, 15; vii. 58, 5; viii. 5, 2; 102, 22. We may therefore translate our passage: \u201cMay we join the living multitudes,\u201d while with the instrumental, we should have had to translate, \u201cMay we be together with living multitudes!\u201d Thus we read R.V. i. 136, 6, jyok j\u012bvanta\u1e25 prajay\u0101 sahemahi, \u201cMay we long live and be together with offspring, i.e. possess offspring.\u201d\nThe question whether *daivyah janah* means really the assembly of gods, or whether it should be translated by Agni, fire, the heavenly man, has been raised on a former occasion, and I still adhere, though, with regard to some passages, rather doubtfully, to the opinion which I then expressed.\u00b9 I should therefore translate: \"O fathers, may the heavenly man, Agni, give us back our soul, may we join the living multitude.\"\n\nThe next verse again is not well explained by S\u0101yana. The words *vrata tava manas tan\u016bshu bibhrata\u1e25* cannot well mean, \"keeping our mind on thy service and on thy members.\" *Tanu* is not used in the sense of members, nor does *bhri*, \"to bear,\" with *manas*, \"mind,\" mean to keep one's mind on something, or to attend. Here again, a little reflection shows that we ought to translate, \"May we in thy service, keeping the soul in our bodies, i.e. keeping alive, join the living multitude.\" The ellipsis is somewhat unusual, yet as the two verses follow each other, *j\u012bvam vr\u0101tam* may well be supplied after the second *sachemahi*. Although *s\u0101m sach\u0101vahai* occurs (vi. 55, 1) in the sense of \"let us join,\" this meaning would hardly be applicable in our passage.\n\nBut while in passages like these, a little reflection and a consideration of similar passages will generally remove all difficulties, it happens not unfrequently that the work of interpretation becomes really a work of deciphering. Nothing will avail but to look at every passage in which we may examine each single word that occurs in the verse to be deciphered; and even after that has been done, the labour is frequently in vain, and we are driven to admit either that the text is corrupt, or that we possess no longer the means of discovering behind the strange words and phrases of the Veda the thoughts which the early poets intended to express. Here lies the real work which a translator of the Veda has to perform; and although different Sanskrit scholars in England, France, and Germany have explained many words and pas-\n\n\u00b9 Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft, vol. ix. p. xxii. 1855. The heavenly host would be *devyo janah* (R.V. vi. 22, 9).\nsages, and removed many difficulties that S\u0101ya\u1e47a was unable to remove, yet a really satisfactory translation of the whole of the Rig-veda will for many years be simply impossible.\n\nIn accordance with the principles of translation which I have explained more fully on former occasions, I shall now endeavour to translate the four hymns which, before, were translated according to the tradition of the Brahmans. And here I have to confess, first of all, that I cannot bring myself to believe in the historical reality of the legend which, according to S\u0101ya\u1e47a, forms the background of our hymns. This may seem gratuitous scepticism, and at this distance of time, and with the utter absence of historical documents, it is so safe that it seems hardly fair, to throw the burden of proof on those who believe in the legend. I do not mean to say that it is impossible that there ever was a king Asam\u0101ti; that he had four priests, brothers of the family of the Gaup\u0101yanas; that he dismissed them and appointed two others in their place; that the Gaup\u0101yanas injured him; that the new priests carried off one of the brothers and nearly killed him, possibly in order to sacrifice him; that the Gaup\u0101yanas then made their peace with the king, and that their brother was finally restored to them. All this may have happened. Nor could any scholar in Europe avail himself of the argument that might be used in the theological schools in India, viz. that no historical events can be referred to in the Veda, because the Veda is believed to have been composed before all time. But what may be urged is this, that the legend itself varies, and varies on essential points; that large portions of the legend owe their origin to a misunderstanding of some antiquated expressions occurring in the Veda and the old Br\u0101hma\u1e47as; and lastly, that if the hymns had been composed for the occasion, the allusion to the events would naturally be more marked and palpable.\n\nSeveral variations in the legend have been pointed out before, but a more important one remains to be noticed. Who were the two priests appointed in the place of the four Gaup\u0101yanas? K\u0101ty\u0101yana calls them simply m\u0101y\u0101vin, which we may translate 'possessed of power,' but more particularly\npossessed of supernatural or magical power.' S\u0101ya\u1e47a speaks of them as Rishis, or sacred and inspired poets. The \u015a\u0101ty\u0101yanaka is more explicit, and, if our text is correct, it speaks of them as asuram\u0101yau, 'possessed of demoniacal powers,' and calls them asuras or evil spirits. The Br\u0101haddevat\u0101 calls them m\u0101y\u0101r\u012bnau drijau, Brahmins endowed with magic powers, and gives their names as Kir\u0101\u1e6da and Akuli. Here we have already several conflicting statements, enough to stagger an orthodox Brahman. But a more important point remains to be noticed. In the T\u0101ndya-br\u0101hma\u1e47a, the story of the Gaup\u0101yanas occurs in a much more simple and primitive form, and here the two demoniacal Brahmins are no Brahmins at all, but females, whatever else they may be. Nothing is said there of King Asam\u0101ti or of the one brother Subandhu, but the legend simply states: \"Two demoniacal M\u0101y\u0101s, of the race of the Kir\u0101\u1e6das, scattered about, inside the sacrificial enclosure, the spirits of the Gaup\u0101yanas who were performing a Sattr\u0101 sacrifice. These worshipped Agni with the hymn: 'Agni, be thou nearest to us.' By it they took again their spirits.\" If this is the foundation of the later stories of the Gaup\u0101yanas, we can see clearly what has happened. The two M\u0101y\u0101s, or female spirits, of the race of the Kir\u0101\u1e6das, Kir\u0101\u1e6da-kulyau, were changed into two men of the name of Kir\u0101\u1e6da and Akuli. The name of Subandhu occurring in the hymn was taken to be the name of one of the Gaup\u0101yanas, and the name of Asam\u0101ti, likewise occurring in the hymn as a name of Indra, was supposed to be the name of a king who,\n\n1 Whether it is Akuli or \u0100kuli cannot be settled from the passages hitherto known. It may be right to mention that in the \u015a\u0101tapatha-br\u0101hma\u1e47a the MSS. really give \u0915\u093f\u0930\u093e\u091f\u093e\u0915\u0941\u0937\u0940, which is explained by the commentary as \u0915\u093f\u0930\u093e\u091f\u093f\u0915\u0941\u0937\u0940 \u0926\u093e\u092f\u092a\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0939\u0924\u093f \u091a\u092e\u094d\u092a\u0941\u0903.\n\n2 It may be right to mention that the MSS. of the T\u0101ndya-br\u0101hma\u1e47a really give \u0915\u093f\u0930\u093e\u091f\u093e\u0915\u0941\u0937\u0940, not \u0915\u093f\u0930\u093e\u091f\u093e\u0915\u0941\u0937\u0940, as printed by Boehtlingk in his Dictionary, s.v. \u0915\u093f\u0930\u093e\u091f\u093e\u0915\u0941\u0937\u0940. The text and commentary of this passage are given on p. 13.\n\n3 R.V. v. 24. S\u0101ya\u1e47a, in his commentary on the T\u0101ndya-br\u0101hma\u1e47a, calls this hymn tricha, consisting of three verses, which would have been appropriate, according to the account of the Br\u0101haddevat\u0101, while in the Rig-veda there are four lines, forming two verses.\n\n4 \u091a\u092e\u094d\u092a\u0941\u0903 is explained by \u091a\u092e\u094d\u092a\u0941\u0903, both meaning \"to cherish.\"\nsomehow or other, was connected with the Gaup\u00e2yanas. The remaining details would be supplied at demand, and the legend would gradually grow into that form in which we now find it in the \u0160atv\u00e2yana, in the Sarv\u00e2nukrama, and in the Brihaddevata. The reasons imagined for the anger of the Gaup\u00e2yanas are truly Brahmanic. It was the professional hatred of one set of priests against another, and the reason for their dismissal savours equally of modern Brahmanism, viz., some little mistake that had occurred in the cooking of the sacrificial viands.\n\nBut although we can thus explain in a natural manner the growth of the legend of the Gaup\u00e2yanas, by simply supplementing the story of the T\u00e2ndya with little indications taken from the hymns themselves, I do not lay much stress on this. Whether there ever was a king Asam\u00e2ti or not, whether he exchanged one set of priests for another or not, what is all that to us? The only real thing we have to deal with are the hymns of the Veda, and one single intelligible thought contained in them, and giving us an insight into the mind of those ancient poets, is worth all the genealogies of shadowy kings and spirits. That there are some valuable thoughts in the hymns which are ascribed to the Gaup\u00e2yanas, must have become clear even from S\u00e2yana\u2019s translation. It will become still clearer if we forget altogether what we have heard about Asam\u00e2ti and the Gaup\u00e2yanas, and translate the hymns as we find them, and as possibly even \u0160aunaka understood them, when he said that they either contained an account of the revival of Subandhu, or praises of the soul.\n\n**Hymn 47.**\n\n1. \u201cLet us not swerve from the (right) path, nor from the Soma-sacrifice, o Indra.

The name of infinitive might well be given up and replaced by a more appropriate term.\n\n\\(^2\\) It is more natural to join n\u0101h with manah and translate, our soul.

M. Gesellschaft, ix. p. xiv.\n\n\\(^4\\) Marichi does not occur again in the R.V. (exc. marichinam, x. 177, 1), but there is no reason to doubt that it had in the Veda the same meaning as in the later literature, viz., ray, splendour. Pravat, which, by Professor Roth, is given as a substantive only, must be taken as an adjective, not only in this, but in several other passages, such as vii. 32, 27. It means 'moving onward,' possibly 'eastern,' like pr\u0101ch.\n10. \"Thy soul which went far away to the whole world, we turn it back, here to dwell and to live.\"\n\n11. \"Thy soul which went far away into the distant distances, we turn it back, here to dwell and to live.\"\n\n12. Thy soul which went far away to the past and the future, we turn it back, here to dwell and to live.\"\n\nHymn 59.\n\n1. \"Life has advanced forward afresh, like the two skilful drivers of the chariot; yea, moving on, man rises to the goal. May Nirriti (the goddess of destruction) indeed go far away!\"\n\n2. \"On our hearth are riches, our food is garnered,\u2014let us\n\n---\n\nThere is clearly not much sense or coherence in this verse as translated according to the commentary of S\u0101yana. S\u0101yana is guided by the traditional notion that this hymn refers to certain details in the story of the death and resurrection of Subandhu, but even thus his explanation can hardly be called natural and happy. The train of thought which he discovers in the words of the poet is this: May the life of Subandhu be increased or advanced, as persons advance who stand in a chariot. Having lost his life Subandhu regains it; may the goddess of mischief fly away! This seems easy enough at first sight, but difficulties soon appear on further consideration. The first half verse means certainly, May life be lengthened, or, life is lengthened; and it will be best to take this in a general sense, without thinking much of Subandhu. Then follows a simile. Now that simile does not speak of one person, but of two, sth\u0101t\u0101r\u0101iva. Sth\u0101tri, with the accent on the first (not to be confounded with sth\u0101tri) means a driver, not one who stands, but one who makes stand, one who controls horses. Thus Indra is frequently called sth\u0101tar\u0101 har\u1e63\u1e47\u0101m, not he who stands on the horses, but he who makes them stand, who holds, checks, and drives them (viii. 24, 17; 33, 12; 46, 1). He is also called sth\u0101t\u0101 rathasya (iii. 45, 2), or sth\u0101tri by itself. R.V. i. 33, 6; vi. 41, 3, har\u1e63\u1e47\u0101 sth\u0101t\u0101 ugra. The Maruts are called simply sth\u0101t\u0101r\u0101, riders or rulers (R.V. v. 87, 6), and jagatah sth\u0101t\u0101h is used R.V. vi. 49, 6, and seems to mean 'ruler of the earth.'\n\nThe real difficulty, however, lies in the dual. Why two riders instead of one? We can hardly say in the Veda metri causa, nor can I think of any explanation except by ascribing to the simile a more special reference to the two most famous drivers in the Veda, the two \u0100\u015bvins, the \u0101\u015bv\u0101n\u0101 sth\u0101t\u0101rd (R.V. i. 181, 3), the r\u0101\u1e6dh\u0101tamau (R.V. i. 182, 2, etc.). As in their original conception, the two \u0100\u015bvins represent the succession of day and night, light and darkness, morning and evening, and other correlative powers, the simile becomes even more telling, if taken in that special sense. But, it may be said, why not take the explanation of S\u0101yana? Why not take kratum\u0101t in the sense of driver, and then translate, \"like two who stand on a chariot are moved on by the charioteer.\" For the simple reason, that the adjective kratum\u0101t is never used in the Veda as a substantive, least of all in the special sense of sdrathi or charioteer. I confess I can make nothing of the instrumental kratuman\u0101t\u0101, but I have only to change it into kratuman\u0101t\u0101 and it becomes the recognised epithet of the \u0100\u015bvins, the clever, the wise, cf. R.V. i. 183, 2, surit r\u0101\u1e6dh\u0101h varataye y\u0101n abhi k\u1e63\u0101d m y\u0101t t\u012bk\u1e63\u1e6dhatha\u1e25 kratuman\u0101t\u0101 dnu pr\u012bk\u1e63\u0101. To read sth\u0101t\u0101r\u0101iva kratuman\u0101t\u0101 rathasya would sanction a hiatus, which might be accepted if supported by the authority of MSS., but which I hesitate to adopt in a conjectural reading.\n\nThe meaning of the next sentence is even more difficult. Chyd\u0101na, though it might mean fallen, does not occur in the Veda in the sense of departed, dead.\nmake good and manifold feasts! The bard may enjoy all that is ours. May Nirriti indeed go far away!\"  \n\n3. \"Let us with our forces overcome the enemies altogether, as the sky the earth, as the mountains the fields. The bard knows all that is ours. May Nirriti indeed go far away!\"\n\n4. \"O Soma, do not altogether deliver us unto death; may we see the sun rising! May old age, sent by the days, be kind to us! May Nirriti indeed go far away!\"\n\n5. \"Thou guide of life, preserve our soul in us, lengthen our age well, that we may live. Grant us to see the sun, and fill thy body with the offered ghee.\"\n\n6. \"Thou guide of life, bestow again upon us sight, again breath, here to enjoy. May we long see the rising sun! O (increasing) Moon, be gracious to us with mercy!\"\n\n7. \"May the Earth again give us life, again the Heaven, again the Sky! May Soma give our body again, and P\u00fbshan the path which is bliss.\"\n\nIn R.V. x. 61, 2, chayavdnah means moving on, arriving; and the same sense is, by Professor Roth, assigned to other forms of chay.\n\nThe expression uttavlti artham is without a parallel in the Rig-veda.\n\nLanglois translates: Que cette existence nouvelle soit prolong\u00e9e, et men\u00e9e (par le ma\u00eetre de la vie) comme un char l\u2019est par un habile \u00e9cuyer. Ainsi celui qui \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9 se rel\u00e8ve. Que Nirriti s\u2019\u00e9loigne.\n\n1 This is again a difficult verse, and, as it stands, simply unintelligible. I read r\u00e2yo instead of r\u00e2ye in order to get at anything like sense. The two nu\u2019s show that the first half-verse contains two sentences. The second of these is clear, literally, our food is possessed of repositories, i.e. our garners are full of food. The first also must have a nominative, and this we get by reading r\u00e2yo instead of r\u00e2ye. S\u00e2man is a locative, which I derive from s\u00e2mman, in the sense of hearth or house. This meaning is conjectural; but there are several passages in the Veda where s\u00e2mman cannot well mean song or poem. Whether it be derived from s\u00e2m, to acquire, so as to mean acquisition, property, or from so, to finish, so as to mean establishment, s\u00e2mman seems to have some meaning like hearth or home in passages such as R.V. viii. 89, 7; ix. 111, 2; 145, 3. However, I only propose this interpretation until a better one can be found, for I cannot bring myself to translate, \"When there is a song sung, there are riches.\"\n\n2 There is nothing to show that Asun\u00eeti is a female deity. Y\u00e2ska (x. 39) takes Asun\u00eeti as a masculine, S\u00e2yana as a feminine. It may be a name for Yama, as Prof. Roth supposes; but it may also be a simple invocation, one of the many names of the deity. The metre requires a syllable in the third half verse, which may easily be supplied by reading s\u00e2m-d\u00eepik\u00e2.\n\n3 Anumati means compliance, grace, and S\u00e2yana takes Anumati as a female deity, a personification of grace. Anumati, however, is likewise a name of one of the phases of the moon, which go by the names of Anumati, R\u00e2k\u00e2, Sinival\u00ee, and Kuh\u00fb. In a prayer for life the moon would naturally come in for an invocation.\n\n4 The explanation of pathyd by speech is evidently old, for S\u00e2yana supports it by a passage from the Br\u00e2hma\u1e47a. It must be confessed, too, that speech would be more appropriate in this passage; yet pathyd in the Rig-veda means path or\n8. \"Ye mighty Heaven and Earth, mothers of right, may there be happiness to our dear friend.\\(^1\\) Whatever evil there is, may they both carry it off! Heaven and gentle Earth! may no evil whatever hurt thee!\"\n\n9. \"Medicines come down from heaven, double and three-fold. A solitary medicine moves about on earth. May they both carry off whatever evil there is! Heaven and gentle Earth! may no evil whatever hurt thee!\"\\(^2\\)\n\n10. \"Indra, stir up the cart-ox that brought here the chariot of the dawn. May they both carry off whatever evil there is! Heaven and gentle Earth, may no evil whatever hurt thee!\"\\(^3\\)\n\n**HYMN 60.**\n\n1. \"Bringing praise we came to the man of radiant aspect,\\(^4\\) who is praised by the great,\u2014\"\n\n2. \"To the matchless, the roaring, the radiant; to the crushing chariot, the good lord of Bhajeratha,\u2014\"\\(^5\\)\n\n3. \"He who overcomes men in battle like oxen, whether he has his weapon or whether he is weaponless,\u2014\"\\(^6\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Subandhu may be a proper name, but even then it would mean good friend, and nothing is lost therefore by keeping to the natural meaning.\n\n\\(^2\\) I take this and some of the later verses as formulas used by wise men or women in effecting medical cures. Such formulas are often very meaningless, and, at all events, we must not look in them for any deep wisdom. The suffixes \\textit{ke} and \\textit{k\u0101}, used for forming repetitive adverbs, are curious. In later Sanskrit we have only \\textit{gas}, the Greek \\textit{ms} or \\textit{xa}.\n\n\\(^3\\) Another verse used for incantations or witchcraft. As the poet speaks of the ox that brought (i.e. that is in the habit of bringing) the chariot of U\u015binar\u0101\u1e47i, we should naturally think of the chariot of the dawn. S\u0101ya\u1e47a, however, takes \\textit{usinar\u0101\u1e47i} in the sense of a medicinal herb, and it may have been so understood by the medical charlatans of India.\n\n\\(^4\\) Most of the epithets here used of the man to whom praise is offered refer to Indra, who, in the fifth verse, is invoked by name. \\textit{Asam\u0101ti}, it is true, does not occur again as applied to Indra, and hence the commentators might easily have been led to take it as a proper name. But in \\textit{asam\u0101tyojas}, of incomparable strength, \\textit{asam\u0101ti} clearly is the same as \\textit{asam\u012bna}, incomparable. Hence I surrender king Asam\u0101ti and all that the Brahmans tell us about him. I believe he took his origin from this verse, and the same verse must be his grave. Professor Roth, if I understand him right, takes the same view. He takes \\textit{n\u012bgama} in the sense of dripping, evidently connecting it with \\textit{ratha}. But the verb \\textit{tup} expresses sound, and the sense of roaring is appropriate to all its derivatives.\n\n\\(^5\\) Bhajeratha must be taken as the name of a people or a country, like Ikshv\u0101ku in the next verse. It may be a dialectic form of Bhagratratha.\n\n\\(^6\\) \\textit{Niyayinam ratham} is a simile introduced without a comparative particle. The adjectives which precede refer to Indra, not to \\textit{ratha}.\n\n\\(^7\\) I tried to explain \\textit{pastrav\u0101n} and \\textit{spastrov\u0101n} in the Beitr\u00e4ge zur Verglei-\n4. \"He in whose service Ikshv\u00e2ku grows, rich, and strong to kill, as the five tribes in heaven.\"\n\n5. \"O Indra, preserve the power among the matchless Rathaproshthas, as the sun to be seen in heaven.\" 2\n\n6. \"Thou harnessest thy two bright horses for the descendants of Agastya. Thou steppest down upon the enemies, upon all, o king, who are ungenerous.\" 3\n\n7. \"This is the mother, this is the father, this thy life came back. This is thy escape, o good friend; come here, come forth!\" 4\n\nchenden Sprachforschung, vol. iii. p. 444 seq. Though the Pada text does not give pavitra-vin, yet I think it right to give up my explanation of pavit-reseda, because I now see that it is possible to give a grammatical explanation of pavitra. Professor Roth derives pavitra from pavit, but this is impossible in Sanskrit. Pavit, with the Taddhita ra would give pavira, like sushira from sush\u00ee (P\u00e2\u00f1. v. 2, 107), but never pavitra. There is, however, the possibility, of which I had not thought before, of classing pavitra with such words as sartra, formed by the U\u1e47\u1e0di tr\u0101n from \u015br\u012b, with guna of the radical vowel (Up\u0101di-S\u00fbtras, ed. Aufrecht, iv. 30). As this seems unobjectionable, I now take pavitra-vin as a possessive adjective in the sense of \"possessed of a thunderbolt or a weapon.\" We thus get a proper climax which was wanting in former translations. As to pavirava, it may now be explained as formed by the possessive Taddhita va (P\u00e2\u00f1. v. 2, 109), like ke\u015bava from ke\u015ba.\n\n1 This is the first mention of Ikshv\u00e2ku, and the only one in the Rig-veda. I take it not as the name of a king, but as the name of a people, probably the people who inhabited Bh\u00e2jeratha, the country washed by the northern Gang\u00e2 or the Bh\u00e2girathi.\n\n2 I think it best to take Rathaproshtha as the name of a tribe. The word does not occur again in the Rig-veda. Professor Roth seems to take it in the sense of chariot, or seat of a chariot, but in that case the prayer for preservation of power would not be appropriate, for kshatra always refers to powers wielded by gods or men. We have seen two rare proper names in the preceding verses, and we need not be surprised at a third, though none of them occurs again in the Rig-veda. In the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata the Proshthas occur as a people.\n\n3 Another difficult verse, chiefly on account of the word nadbhyah, which does not occur again, Professor Roth derives it from nah, in the sense of rope, and he compares akshinah (R.V. x. 53, 7), fastened to the axle, the name of a horse. I confess I do not see how, with such a word in the dative or ablative, any sense can be elicited from our verse. If one might indulge in conjectures, I should read naptribhyah, for Agastya occurs both with three and four syllables. But why should so simple a word have been changed into nadbhyah? The Pada gives nat-bhyah, and this S\u00e2yana derives evidently from the verb nand, which has given rise to several derivatives in the sense of son, or relative, or descendant. It might be possible, etymologically, to derive nah from nah or nabh (from which nabhi, relationship), and to take it in the sense of relatives, literally, ties. But nadbhyah may also be an old dat. plur. of napit. The Pada-form of napit, if we may judge from the fem. napit, nepit, would have been nept. This, before bhyah, would have been regularly changed into nap, This, with bhyah, would have become nabbhyah. Now in order to avoid the want of euphony, we see that ab-hyah is changed to ad-bhyah. Why not nab-bhyah into nad-bhyah?\n\nThe Rishis Bandhu, Subandhu, Srutabandhu, and Devabandhu, are called the sister-sons of Agastya in Mantr\u00e2rsh\u00e2dhy\u00e2ya. See Ind. Stud. iii. 459.\n\n4 The last verses are evidently formulas used for restoring health or life. Like most of such formulas they are not always very coherent or very wise. Their\n8. \"As they tie the yoke with a guard, that it may hold, thus I have held thy soul for life, not for death, ay for safety.\"\u00b9\n\n9. \"As this great earth has held these forest trees, thus I have held thy soul for life, not for death, ay for safety.\"\n\n10. \"I have brought back the soul of our dear friend from Yama Vaivasvata, for life, not for death, ay for safety.\"\n\n11. \"Down blows the wind, down shines the sun, down milks the cow, down be thy sin!\"\n\n12. \"This hand of mine is blessed; this hand of mine is more blessed; this hand of mine is all-healing, this has a lucky touch.\"\n\nIf now we ask ourselves for what purpose these four hymns could have been composed, it must be confessed, first of all, that, with the exception of the second hymn, the rest are not very closely strung together, and it is by no means certain that they are not rather a collection of verses than consecutive poems. Taking, however, the hymns as they stand, we may observe a difference between the first, second, and fourth on one side, and the third on the other. The former are addressed to some friend, spoken of in the second person, whose life is in danger, while, in the third, the poet, speaking in the first person plural, seems to fear for his own safety, at least in the seven verses in the beginning. In the concluding verses the friend is addressed again in the second person, and recommended to the protection of the gods. The situation thus brought before us by these hymns seems to be a battlefield or a siege, in which the enemies have wounded one person who lies like dead among his friends, and whom his friends try to recall to life. Their endeavours of awakening the efficacy would seem to depend on a certain amount of mysterious obscurity. Observe the apparently irregular gender in ayam m\u0101t\u0101, also in ayam j\u0101vatuk, for j\u0101vatuk is usually feminine. It may be, however, that the speaker, who evidently is the enchanter or mesmeriser, points to himself, saying, as if with the Greek \u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03b7\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, \"This is the mother, this is the father, this is thy life, i.e. I who bring thee back to life.\" Professor Roth translates prasarpana by unterkommen. Does he mean livelihood? The nir \u012bhi, come forth! seems to show that prasarpana means the escaping of the soul from the place where it is supposed to be held captive.\n\n\u00b9 Varatr\u00e1 means a guard, i.e. a guard chain. D\u0101dhira I take to be the first person, considering the construction of verse 10.\nwounded from a swoon, or their attempts\u2014whether successful or not, we know not\u2014of calling one really killed in battle back to life, are accompanied with sacrificial oblations, with laying on of hands, and with the recitation of certain charms. If we were at liberty to re-arrange the hymns, I should propose to end the third hymn with verse 7. The three remaining verses would then form an invocation by themselves. Then, again, verses 1\u20136 of the fourth hymn would form a perfect address to Indra, while the concluding verses by themselves look like a collection of medical charms, such as are very common among poor and ignorant people. The last verse clearly shows that the healing powers of the hands, or what we now call mesmeric strokes, were known long before Mesmer's time. This is interesting; but far more interesting even in these hymns, which are by no means fair specimens of the best religious poetry of the Brahmans, is the constant dwelling on the divine powers which govern the life of man. Whether they are addressed as Indra and Soma, or as Heaven and Earth, or as Guide of Life and Good Lord, it is the gods who reward their worshippers with health and wealth, who give life and death, who destroy evil or sin. The hymns with which the fathers praised the gods, possibly the cups in which they offered their libations, are kept with religious care, nay, the fathers themselves, departed this life, but enjoying immortality, are invoked to bestow blessings on their descendants. The sacrifice is kept up in each family, and this sacrificial succession is looked upon like an unbroken chain uniting each generation, like a new link, with the generation that preceded, and at last with the gods themselves, who were worshipped by the ancient prophets. Let us also observe, particularly in the second hymn, the clear conception of a soul as separate from the body; of a soul, after death, going to Yama Vaivasvata, the ruler of the departed, or hovering about heaven or earth, the sun, the dawn, the water or the plants, ready to be called back to a new life. If we reflect on these germinal thoughts and on the vast proportions they were intended to assume in the later history of the Aryan world down to our own time, we shall have to\nadmit that, even if we lose the legend of king Asam\u0101ti and the squabbles of his rival priests, there is still enough left, even in these meagre hymns, that will repay the student for the patient deciphering of the sacred records left to us by the fathers of our own, the Aryan, race.\n\nII \u092d\u094d\u0930\u092e \u092e\u093e\u0927\u0935\u0940\u092f\u0947\u0935\u0947\u0926\u092d\u093e\u0937\u094d\u092f

XII.\u2014Specimen Chapters of an Assyrian Grammar.\n\nBy the Rev. E. Hincks, D.D., Hon. M.R.A.S.\n\nA great number of years have now elapsed since I began to collect materials for an Assyrian grammar; an object, of which I have never since lost sight. Of late, I have been preparing my materials for publication; but a preliminary question has suggested itself:\u2014\"If I were to publish a grammar, who would read it?\" The persons for whose instruction I should naturally write would be either persons who were acquainted with other Semitic languages, and who were desirous of comparing the grammars of these with that of the oldest and the best developed language of the family; or else persons, who desired to study this language for its own sake, and who sought the aid of a grammar, in the absence of an oral instructor, to teach them the first principles of this \"Sanskrit of the Semitic tongues,\" which they might afterwards improve upon by their own studies.\n\nI believe that persons of both these classes would derive benefit from such a grammar as I should publish, if they would only make use of it. I fear, however, that no person of either of the classes has so much faith in me, and in my knowledge of Assyrian grammar, as to make use of it. My only readers would probably be my critics;\u2014those, who have attained some knowledge of the Assyrian language\u2014considerable knowledge, I may say, so far as respects the meaning of words,\u2014but whose published translations show that, as respects grammar, their views are extremely different from mine; and, of course, if my views be correct, extremely erroneous. My only readers would thus be, with perhaps one or two exceptions, hostile critics, who must condemn what I have written, because, by laying down rules which they have disregarded and violated in their translations, it indirectly condemns those translations.\n\nIn the case of one eminent Assyrian writer on the con\u2014\ntinent, the certainty that I should meet with hostile criticism is more obvious than it is in the case of others. Dr. Oppert has published an Assyrian grammar, of which I have already stated that, besides minor errors, it was pervaded by three erroneous general principles, \"so as scarcely to leave a page free from what I consider pernicious error.\" One of these three principles, Dr. Oppert, in a late article in the Journal Asiatique, intimates that he has abandoned, or is disposed to abandon. To the other two he clings pertinaciously. Now, as I cannot retract the unfavourable opinion above expressed, and as, according to my views of Assyrian grammar, I cannot think the translations from Sargon, which MM. Oppert and M\u00e9nant have published, to be even approximately correct, I could not possibly expect any criticism from those gentlemen but of the most adverse description.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I have thought it advisable to deviate materially from my original plan. Instead of publishing an entire grammar, I will, in the first instance, publish specimen-chapters only; treating of the declensions of substantives and adjectives, and of the permansive forms of verbs;\u2014a subject on which Dr. Oppert, in the Journal Asiatique for last year (Tome vi. p. 297), has mis-stated both my views and the facts to which he appeals. Instead, too, of stating what I believe to be the grammatical rules of the Assyrian language, dogmatically, as would be the natural course of the writer of a grammar, I will deduce them from those leading positions on which all are agreed, by inductive proofs, in the order which appears to me the best for this purpose; different as this order is from what I should adopt if I were exempt from the necessity of writing otherwise than dogmatically. My examples must be numerous, because they are not merely illustrative, but justificatory. It will readily be understood that where I bring forward a number of proofs in support of any assertion, it is one which is not generally accepted, and is likely to be controverted; but except in the one case of the permansive forms of the verb, which I have already mentioned, I do not mean to point out directly what I believe to be the errors of others. It will answer my end,\nand will be pleasanter to myself, if I merely seek to establish\nthe correctness of my own views. This being done, the in-\ncorrectness of any views that are inconsistent with them will\nfollow as a matter of course.\n\nA few words should be said here on the principles on which\nI have conducted my investigations. I have sought the rules\nof Assyrian grammar by induction from passages, the mean-\ning of which I considered to be perfectly known, occurring in\nwritings of a good age; the induction being guided by a\ngeneral knowledge of Semitic grammar. I have taken no\naccount of passages, however well their meaning may be\nknown, which are found in texts of a late age, probably written\nby persons who had a very imperfect knowledge of Assyrian,\nand of whom it was not the native tongue. Neither have I\nassumed the identity of Assyrian and Hebrew rules of gram-\nmatical construction in cases where there is no inductive evi-\ndence of it.\n\nAs to the transcriptions of Assyrian words and texts which\nI give, I think that it is unnecessary to say much. Were I\nto publish a grammar, it should contain a list of all the cha-\nracters representing syllables consisting of a single vowel, or a\nvowel preceded or followed by a consonant, and of all those whose\nvalues were syllables consisting of a vowel both preceded and\nfollowed by a consonant, and which occurred in any text quoted\nin the grammar. To each character its transcription should\nbe attached. I represent, as every one else does, \u1e2b, \u1e2b, \u1e2b, \u1e61, \u1e61,\n\u1e25, \u1e25, \u1e25, \u1e25, \u1e25, \u1e25, and \u1e25, by b, g, d, z, k, l, m, n, p, r, and t.\nI also represent \u1e2b by \u1e25, \u1e2b by \u1e61, \u1e2b by \u1e61 (which was anciently\nsounded either st, or sk; the former being, like \u1e61, repre-\nsented by the Arabic \u0633, the latter by \u0634, and by the Greek\n\u03be, which occupied the same position in the alphabet, and had\nthe same figure as the Phoenician \u05d3), \u1e61 by \u1e61, \u1e61 by q, and \u1e61\nby s. The remaining five letters, \u1e2b, \u1e2b, \u1e2b, \u1e2b, \u1e2b, are indiscri-\nminately transcribed as \u1e2b with the following exceptions:\n\u1e2b\u1e2b\u1e2b\u1e2b is transcribed by ya; \u1e61 \u1e61 \u1e61 \u1e61 by 'u or yu; \u1e61 \u1e61 after an-\nother \u1e61 \u1e61 by 'a or yd; \u1e61 \u1e61, when a copulative, by ea; and\n\u1e2b\u1e2b\u1e2b\u1e2b by \u1e25 or ih. I use the vowel e alone to represent \u1e61 \u1e61,\n\u00e8 standing for \u1f19\u03a5\u03a5\u03a5. The grave accent over a vowel is not intended to mark a distinction of sound, but to show that a homophone of the character usually representing the syllable without the accent is used in place of that character. I use four vowels in transcriptions, a, i, u, and e, which I believe the Assyrians pronounced as long i, or i. I think that no Assyrian scholar will find any difficulty in restoring the text of my transcriptions; but if he do, he can consult the original text, to which I refer him. To explain my references, I will observe that B. means Botts's plates; L., the first series of British Museum plates, edited by Mr. Layard; I. and II., the two volumes of the second series of British Museum plates, edited by Sir H. Rawlinson. The number which precedes this is the number of the plate in each series, and the number at the end is the line in the plate; with a distinctive mark before it, if necessary, the meaning of which will be seen when the plate is referred to. In some of the plates of the second series, I use r, c, and l for right, centre, and left. In these references, and in the transcriptions, I have followed as closely as I could Mr. Norris.\n\nI believe that the main point in which I differ from Mr. Norris in my transcriptions is that I do not attempt to distinguish in most cases between the several breathings and semivowels. I do not think that we can distinguish them by inspection of the Assyrian characters. We can only do so by knowledge derived from some other source. I find, for instance, \u1f19 occurring in four words; between ma and du, between na and du, between ta and bu, and between da and nu. I transcribe it in the four instances by 'a. I happen to know from the Hebrew that in the first word the 'a represents \u1f19, in the second \u1f19, in the third \u1f19, and in the fourth \u1f19; the four words signifying much or great from \u1f19\u039d\u0394, glorious from \u1f19\u039d\u0394, good from \u1f19\u039d\u0394, and a judge from \u1f19\u039d\u0394. In another word which had no Hebrew equivalent, I should not know how to render the characters so as to make a distinction; and I therefore do not make it in the cases where I am able to do so. Some persons would in all these instances represent the \u1f19\nby accenting the preceding vowel. In most cases, however, I think that this would be an error. Where it is plain to me that two characters represent together but one syllable, I cut off one of the vowels by an apostrophe; but I do not consider it a matter of course to do so, nor do I use an accent in all cases where I do so.\n\nWhen two syllables are joined together without a point, it will be understood that they are, in the original, not represented phonetically, but by monograms, ideograms, or Accadian roots, as they have been variously called. In such cases I generally give the cuneiform characters in brackets, with i.e. after them, before I give the words that I read. When, however, the signification of the monogram is well known and universally admitted, I omit the cuneiform characters.\n\n[Chapter V.] On Verbs, and first on their permansive parts.\n\n1. Generally speaking, a verb admits of seven principal conjugations, of which the first six correspond to the first six of the recognized Hebrew conjugations; the seventh being the causative of the third. I denote them by the seven first Roman numerals. Other conjugations are occasionally met with, but are less frequent. It will, of course, be understood that no one verb is used in all the conjugations.\n\n2. Each of these seven admits of a secondary or augmented conjugation, which I denote by the proper Roman numeral followed by t. The augmented conjugation regularly inserts t or te after the first radical letter, or in the conjugations V.\u2013VII. after the preformative s. In some cases the insertion of this letter or syllable is the only difference between the augmented conjugation and its principal one; but in other cases, other changes are introduced which will be mentioned in the sequel.\n\n3. The inserted t is sometimes changed into d or t, through the influence of the letter with which it comes in contact; and sometimes through its influence that letter undergoes a change. Another irregularity, which is apt to be more puzzling, is that in most verbs defective in the second radical\n(concave verbs) the dental precedes the first radical in place of following it. Thus, we have from \\( \\text{N} \\), in the aorist of I.t, \\( \\text{it.bu.ni} \\), instead of \\( \\text{ib.tu.ni} \\), \"they came on\" (90 L. 63).\n\n4. Generally speaking, again, the verbal forms belonging to each conjugation may be divided into two great classes, which I call permansive and mutative. The former denotes continuance in the state which the verb signifies in that conjugation; the latter denotes change into that state. Each portion of the forms belonging to the conjugation has tenses and verbal nouns. The permansive tenses are analogous to the so-called Hebrew preterite, having no preformatives, but having terminations added, (except in the third person singular masculine, which has none, as in Hebrew), by which the number, person, and gender are distinguished. The mutative tenses, on the contrary, are analogous to the so-called Hebrew future, having one or other of the preformatives \\( \\text{N} \\) always prefixed to the root, whether or no there be any distinctive addition at the end.\n\n5. The distinction here made between permansive and mutative forms is in my judgment a fundamental one, on the proper development of which all accurate knowledge of the Assyrian language must depend. Now, Dr. Oppert, has in a recent number of the Journal Asiatique (Tome vi. p. 297), ridiculed the existence of any such forms as what I call permansive, characterising them as being a mere fancy of mine. The first thing then that I have to do is to establish the existence of such forms by a number of clear examples.\n\n6. I will begin with comparing two sentences from adjoining columns of Taylor's Cylinder, in which the same root occurs,\u2014a perfect root having three letters incapable of change,\u2014namely, \\( \\text{N} \\). It signifies in Arabic celavit (Frey. iv. 10), and this may be the meaning in the single passage in the Hebrew Bible where it occurs (see Ges. 723). At any rate this seems clearly the meaning in the two Assyrian passages which I will cite. In the former of these, 40 I. 68, Sennacherib, after mentioning the destruction of certain towns concluding with \\( \\text{ak.mu} \\), \"I burned,\" proceeds thus. I omit a simile which is evidently parenthetical. \\( \\text{Qu.tur n'a.ak.mu.ti} \\).\nsu.nu . . . . p'a.an [i.e.] same.'e rap.su.ti 'u.sak.tim, \"the smoke of their being burned (like a ponderous cloud) the face of the wide heavens I made to conceal.\" The verb is here in the l. s. of the aorist of (the causative) Conjugation V., having two objects expressed, that which is made to produce, and that which is made to undergo, the change. The preceding verb 'akmu is the l. s. of the aorist of I. of the verb \u05e0\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05dd. Let us now proceed to 41 I. 45. I omit another comparison to a cloud, which is parenthetical. [i.e.] epir sepi.su.nu . . . p'a.an same.'e rap.su.ti ka.t'i.im, \"the dust of their feet (like, etc.) the face of the wide heavens is concealing.\" In my judgment, nothing can be clearer than that katim is the 3. m. s. of the principal permansive tense. Dr. Oppert says that I \"substitute participles for the 3. s. m.\" By a participle I presume he means what I call the nomen mutantis. No doubt the latter would be katim, or, as I should write it for distinction, k\u0101tim; but this would stand before what it governs; it should then be translated \"the concealer of (the face of the wide heavens),\" and it would require a verb to complete a sentence. It might as well be said that the second word in Genesis was a participle, or any other 3. m. s. of the preterite in the Bible. In this portion of Taylor's Cylinder we have no less than six long lines and a half in which there is nothing that he acknowledges to be a verb. In l. 43, Sennacherib begins to describe an attack upon him by an immense multitude of his enemies, whom he compares to locusts. All are doing the same things in constant succession, and accordingly, in speaking of what they do, he uses only permansive tenses. In l. 44 we have te.bu.'u.ni, \"they are coming on,\" the 3. m. p. of the permansive of I.t. of the verb \u05e0\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05d0\u05b5\u05d4. It has exactly the same relation to it.bu.ni, \"they came on,\" cited in \u00a7 3, as ka.t'i.im in l. 47 has to iktum, \"it concealed.\" Passing over a permansive verb in l. 48, the discussion of which would lead to a digression, we have in l. 49, after the description of the position taken by his enemies, zab.tu.va, \"they are occupying, and,\" followed by a mutative verb. Surely it cannot be maintained with any\nshow of reason that \u0161ab.tu, followed as it is by the copulative enclitic which connects verbs, and verbs only, and this by an acknowledged verb, is anything else than a verb, and yet it has no preformative. The verb \u0161ab.tu is a very common one in the mutative tenses of both I. and V.\n\n7. Before going further, I will give paradigms of the declension of the three principal tenses of the imaginary verb \u0161ab.tu;\u2014the permansive present, the aorist, and the mutative present, or present simply. The latter is written indifferently with g or gg; the duplication of the second radical being euphonic, and not characteristic of the third conjugation. What really characterizes this conjugation is the use of u as the vowel of the preformative. It is invariably so used in Conjugations III., V., and VII., and their augmented conjugations; and never so in any other conjugation, unless the first radical of the verb be \u1e0d. Each of these three principal tenses admits a secondary tense formed by the addition of u to forms which end in the third radical, and of ni to those which end in an added vowel. The most important of these secondary tenses is that derived from the present, which is clearly a future.\n\n8. Paradigms of the three principal tenses of Conjugation I.:\n\n| Permansive Present | Aorist | Present |\n|--------------------|--------|---------|\n| 1. s. paglaku, or paglak | 'apgul | 'apaggil, or 'apagil |\n| 2. m.s. paglita | tapgul | tapaggil |\n| 2. f.s. paglti | tapguli | tapaggili |\n| 3. m.s. pagil | ipgul | ipaggil |\n| 3. f.s. paglat | tapgul | tapaggil |\n| 1. p. paglunu | napgul | napaggil |\n| 2. m.p. pagltunu | tapgulu | tapaggilu |\n| 2. f.p. pagltina | tapgula | tapaggila |\n| 3. m.p. paglu | ipgulu | ipaggilu |\n| 3. f.p. pagla | ipgula | ipaggila |\n\nThe forms of the second person plural may require correction; but I believe that all the others may be depended upon. I use i as the vowel after the second radical in the permansive and ordinary present, and u in the aorist. These are the most\ncommon vowels, but many verbs have different ones. Perhaps the third person feminine singular sometimes ends in \\(a\\), that is \\(a\\), like the Hebrew \\(\u05d0\\). An apparent example is in 18 I. 62, where the nominative is singular, \\(sa\\), referring to \\(u.ba.nu\\) \\(a.zi.tu\\), \u201ca projecting summit;\u201d and we have \\(su.qa.lu.la\\) in the printed text, and \\(lat\\) as a variant. The latter is, however, the reading of far the most copies, if not of all. In 33 I. 2-48, we have \\(su.qa.lu.la\\); but there the nominative is plural, \\(u.ba.n'a.at\\) \\(sad.e\\), \u201cthe summits of the mountain.\u201d In 24 I. 51, we have also \\(su.qa.lu.la\\), but here the nominative is masculine singular; and the final \\(a\\) is, as very often happens, a representative of \\(ea\\), the copulative enclitic, and not an inflexion of the verb.\n\n9. What are called the personal pronouns of the first and second persons are really, as I have stated long since, permansive presents of a verb signifying \u201cto be here,\u201d \\(adsum\\); and \\(ana\\), \u201cad,\u201d \u201cto,\u201d or \u201cfor,\u201d is to be referred to the same root, \\(\u05d0\u05d0\u05d0\\). The true personal pronouns are the affirmatives of the permansive present, \\(aku\\), \\(nu\\), and \\(ta\\), with its derivatives. It is these which the comparative grammarian should compare with the Indo-European pronouns. By the way, I never said, as Dr. Oppert represents me to have said, that the second person of the permansive present ended in \\(ka\\) and \\(ki\\), as in Ethiopic. What I said was, that the fact of the first persons ending alike in Assyrian and Ethiopic ought not to be relied on as proof of a special connection between those two languages, because the Ethiopians had \\(k\\) in the second person, as well as in the first, while the Assyrians had not.\n\n10. I will now give some other examples of permansive presents: In the descriptions of permanent features of a country, which are so frequently found in the historical inscriptions, the permansive tense is constantly used. Thus e.g. in 11 I. 43, etc., we read of \u201chigh mountains, which, like the edge of a sword, \\(sam.tu\\), are piercing; which, for the passing of chariots, \\(la.a na.tu.u\\), are not fitted.\u201d The exact force of the roots \\(\u05d0\u05d0\u05d0\\) and \\(\u05d0\u05d0\u05d0\\) or \\(\u05d0\u05d0\u05d0\\) may be questioned, but the general sense is clear. The king tells us that he left his chariots behind, and crossed the mountains without them;\nand here he uses the aorist. In 22 I. 105, we have kir.hu.su kima 'u.b'a.an sad.e sa.kin, \"Its top (or head) like the summit of a mountain was lying,\" or simply \"was.\" The verb \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05e8 in its mutative parts signifies, actively, \"to place,\" or \"make;\" in the permansive parts \"to lie,\" or \"be.\" This is something like what happens in several Greek verbs, as \u1f24\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9, and in Latin, where facio, as well as fio, is etymologically connected with fuo.\n\n11. The permansive present is also habitually used in the passive conjugations; for the state denoted by these forms is generally a permanent one. So in Greek we have \u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c3\u03b9, and in Latin, to a greater extent, puleatus sum, etc., as well as pulsati sunt. Thus, we have 42 I. 11, ra.ki.bu.s'i.in di.ku, \"their riders were killed,\" and soon after, si.na mus.su.ra, \"they (f.) were abandoned.\" In 38 L. 8, we have \u0161'u.uh.ku.rat su.bat.ja, \"its site (was made, i.e. as often in Hebrew) was judged to be small.\" Examples might be quoted almost without end.\n\n12. I will now pass to the first person. Dr. Oppert objects to an example which I gave formerly. In 19 I. 101, we read, as it is printed, ina li.me \u016b.ma, ina Ninua uz.ba.ku, which I have translated \"In the eponymy of a certain person, in Nineveh I am stopping.\" I ought, however, to have translated it, \"In the same eponymy.\" The character in two copies that I have collated is not that for \u016b, the copulative conjunction, but that which occurs so commonly on the tablets, signifying \"the same.\" There can, I think, be no doubt that this is the correct reading in all the inscriptions; and that the copyists have substituted a common character for one which was not familiar to them. In 18 I. 69, we have Ina li.me an.ni.ma, \"in the eponymy of this person,\" that is, \"of myself.\" This is one of the many substitutes for the pronoun \"my,\" which we meet with in the Assyrian inscriptions. This is sometimes contracted into an.ma, as in 40 L. 50. The \u05d0\u05b5\u05dc seems to be used to indicate that a peculiar mode of expression is used; or perhaps it may signify \"and so forth.\" Speaking of these substitutes for the possessive pronouns, I consider it due to Dr. Oppert to acknowledge the great merit of his late dis-\ncovery of the signification of *raman*, which had been so long a puzzle to Assyrian students. I adopt his explanation as perfectly correct, and I have met with five or six passages, besides those cited by himself, which it explains in the most satisfactory manner. *O si sic omnia!*\n\n13. The explanation of *u\u1e63.ba.ku* given above, \u201cI am stopping,\u201d clashes with Dr. Oppert\u2019s view in two respects. It is a permansive present, a tense which he does not acknowledge; and it is that of the verb \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc, a defective in \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc, of which he has affirmed in his grammar that the Assyrians had none. It appears then absolutely necessary for the maintenance of his system that he should do away with this passage; and I will quote from p. 297, what he says on the subject: \u201cD\u2019abord, on ne lit jamais *usbaku*, mais toujours *usbakuni* dans les inscriptions de Sardanapale III., dans la phrase; \u2018Pendant qu\u2019ils me retinrent \u00e0 Ninive, etc.\u2019 *U\u1e63bakuni* est la 3me pers. du pluriel de \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea\u05be\u05d0\u05b5\u05ea \u00e0 l\u2019iphtegal avec le suffixe. Sans suffixe, ce serait *yu\u1e63abaku* \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea\u05be\u05d0\u05b5\u05ea, ou m\u00eame *yu\u1e63abaku* \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea\u05be\u05d0\u05b5\u05ea (G.A. \u00a7 128), et contract\u00e9 avec le suffixe (ibid. \u00a7 197) \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05dc \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea\u05be\u05d0\u05b5\u05ea. Voil\u00e0 \u00e0 quoi se r\u00e9duit la 1re personne en *ku*. Et ce seul example, si m\u00eame il \u00e9tait av\u00e9r\u00e9, ne pourrait avoir une grande port\u00e9e, quand on le compare aux milliers de formes des aoristes fournies par les textes.\u201d\n\n14. I have given the whole of this passage from M. Oppert\u2019s text; and I must say, that I think I have never read a passage of the same length, in which there are so many mis-statements as to matters of fact. The word *u\u1e63baku* does occur in the passage cited; and when he denied that it did so, Dr. Oppert must have trusted to a treacherous memory. There is no *ni* after it in the printed text; there is no various reading noted in 19 I. 101; and, moreover, I collated, some years ago, very carefully, all the copies of the inscriptions brought over by Mr. Layard, which substantially coincide with that which is printed, and I am thus in possession of some important various readings which are not printed; and I can say most positively that there is *not a single copy* which contains any other reading than *u\u1e63baku*, which Dr. Oppert says \u201con ne lit JAMAIS!\u201d Elsewhere, e.g. in l. 94 of the same plate, *ni* is added; but there the sentence begins with *ki*, \u201cwhen;\u201d\nand I translate \"when in \u015eur I was stopping.\" This is the secondary permansive tense noted at the end of \u00a7 7. Where there is no ki at the beginning of the sentence, there is no ni at the end of u\u0161baku. In the second place, the existence of the verb \u1e63\u1e63D is, so far as I am aware, a pure fiction. I never recollect to have met it, and I believe no one else has met it. It has been imagined purely for the purpose of neutralizing a text, the existence of which is inconsistent with two grammatical dreams. But in the third place, even if the existence of this verb be granted, it could not produce by any legitimate process such a grammatical monstrosity as yu\u0161bakuni. Dr. Oppert cannot produce any similar form. \u1e25\u1e63bakuni would be legitimate; and so would \u1e25\u1e63abkuni, or with \u1e63t or \u1e63s in the place of \u1e63; yu\u1e63abkuni might pass also for Conj. III.; but the substitution of yu for \u1e63 before \u1e63b\u2014such a form as yupgaluni\u2014is unparalleled. Yu and \u1e63 are not interchangeable, as he says in his grammar, the former is used in Conj. III., the latter in Conj. I.; but these two conjugations, the Pihel and Qal of the Hebrews, he has blended together in hopeless confusion.\n\n15. But, perhaps, the most extraordinary sentence in the passage I have quoted is the last. The first question at issue is, whether the Assyrians had, like the Hebrews, at least one tense in each conjugation, in which there were no preformatives. It is in regard to this tense that we are at issue; that they had also a tense or tenses in each conjugation, which had preformatives, we are agreed. Now if I can establish even a single instance, in which a verb has no preformative, my case is proved. The fact is, however, that there are hundreds of instances of permansive verbs in inscriptions of every age, from Tiglath Pileser to Darius. Dr. Oppert says that sarraku, even if it should not be read sarratus,\u2014a supposition which the variant form in ak (of which presently) proves to be untenable,\u2014may mean \"I am a king,\" and yet not be a verb. Here I differ from him. I say, in common I believe with all grammarians, that a word which includes in itself a pronominal subject, a copula and a predicate, is essentially a verb. It might as well be denied that malakta in 2 Sam. iii. 21, was a verb, because malk\u0113, \"kings of,\" is a noun. In 17\nI. 32, etc., there are, after the completion of a sentence, no less than eleven words ending in *aku*. I take them to be permansive presents in the l. s., ten of them belonging to triliteral verbs in the first, third or fourth conjugations, and the eleventh to a quadriliteral. It is not the slightest objection to this view that substantives or adjectives are in use, containing the former part of the alleged verb. So it is in all the Semitic languages. There is a *nomen permanentis*, and a permansive present; the beginnings of which generally agree, though their endings are generally as different as the cases of *rex* and the persons of *rego*. In the proper names *Nabuna'id*, \u201cNebo is glorious,\u201d and *Na'id-Mar.duk*, \u201cMarduk is glorious,\u201d as well as in *na.h.da.ku* in l. 32, we have the permansive present; in E.I.H. I. 3, on the contrary, *ru.ba.'s na.a.adam*, \u201cthe glorious prince,\u201d gives us the *nomen permanentis*, here an adjective.\n\n16. In the Babylonian inscriptions the *u* at the end of the l. s. is dropped. Thus in E.I.H. I. 39, we have *p'i.it.lu.h'a.al be.l'u.ut.s'u.un*, \u201cI am habitually worshipping their lordships.\u201d The *u*, it will be observed, is also dropped in this affix, as it sometimes is in the affix *su*, when added to a word ending with a vowel. This is the l. s. of the permansive present in the first augmented conjugation of *\u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b5\u05e2*. Before this, in l. 10, the king had used the permansive past (badly spelled), *b'i.it.l'u.hu b'i.e.l'u.ut.s'u.un*, \u201che has been habitually worshipping their lordships.\u201d In the Nakshi-Rustam inscription, l. 9, we have *s'a.al.t'a.ak*, \u201cI am ruling,\u201d as the translation of *patiyakhshiya*, or rather of the latter part of this Persian word; for the preposition at the beginning is expressed in the Babylonian text by a separate preposition. I was curious to see what Dr. Oppert would make of this, and I turned to his transcription of it into Hebrew characters in the Z. D. M. G. XI. 136. I was no little surprised to find that he makes two words out of these four characters, namely, *\u05e0\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05d0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05e0\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05d0\u05b5\u05d9*. The latter of these two words he has substituted for the termination *ak*, which he did not understand! This led me to look further into his transcriptions. In l. 24 there is a passage, the true reading and signification of the first word of\nwhich was suggested to me by Mr. Talbot. \u1d57 is \u1d57ub as well as \u1d57ib. The reading is \u1d57ub.bu.'u sa 'ana.ku zi.ba.'a.ka. I take the ka to represent ak, which would look very awkward after ba.'a; while if the \u1d57 were omitted it would be natural to read \u1d57ibak; the word is really \u1d57iba'ak. I translate, \"they are always made to will what I am willing.\" Here, again, Dr. Oppert transcribes the four characters by \u1d57 \u1d57 \u1d57 \u1d57 instead of \u1d57 \u1d57 \u1d57 \u1d57, introducing a second imaginary word in place of a termination which he does not understand.\n\n17. These are not the only instances of permansive verbs in the Nakshi-Rustam inscription. In l. 26, we have \u1d57ul.lu, \"has been holding,\" a deponent verb like dominatus erat; and in the following line we may restore the damaged word of Conj. IV. \u1d57a.su.'u, \"are carrying,\" from \u1d57 \u1d57. This word occurs again l. 18 (\"The Ionians who maginat on their heads) are carrying;\" as does the preceding word in l. 11 (\"my laws) they are holding;\" \u1d57 \u1d57 \u1d57 \u1d57, which must be here read \u1d57a, being added to the singular, to form the feminine plural. An eighth permansive form occurs in l. 21, where in speaking of the depraved state of the people before Darius became king, the obscure word \u1d57ummu\u1e25u is used. To these eight instances of permansive words I think myself entitled to add two others in which \u1d57anaku is used as a verb, there being no other in the sentence. Now, I can only count thirty-one mutative verbs in this inscription; so that the permansive verbs are in the inscription about a fourth of all the verbs. In the inscriptions generally they are perhaps a fifth or sixth of the whole; but this is a very different proportion from \"one to thousands.\"\n\n18. I will now give some examples of permansive forms of two verbs, the meanings of which have been strangely misconceived, \u1d57 \u1d57, \"to have,\" and \u1d57 \u1d57, \"to be.\" Both are used in the mutative, as well as in the permansive tenses; and in the former verb, there is a great liability to confusion, the aorist being in both the first and third persons singular \u1d57si, as in E.I.H. 10, 15, where we have the derivative form \u1d57ya \u1d57si na.ki.ri, \"let me not have enemies.\" The 3 s. of the permansive form would, I presume, be written precisely alike; and \u1d57su.'u and \u1d57sa.'a would be the 3 p. m. and f. in both the\naorist and the permansive tense. We have, however, in 9 I. 58, a form which is clearly permansive, ma.hi.ra (in another copy sa.ni.na) 'as ta.hazi la i.sa.'a.ku, \"a confronter (or rival) in the close combat I have not.\" In l. 44 of the same plate we have ma.hi.ru la i.su.'u, \"a confronter has not had;\" and in 42 L. 40, the name given by Sennacherib to his palace is sa sa.ni.na la i.su.'u, \"which has not had a rival.\"\n\n19. The verb \"to be\" occurs frequently in a variety of mutative forms; as in 3 m. s. Conj. I. sa.min ul ib.si, \"rival (or adversary) there was not,\" 18 I. 43; mal.ku gab.r'a.a.'a ul ib.si, \"king prevailing against me there was not,\" 145 B. 1; for which we have in 171 B. 7, gab.r'a.a.su ul ib.su.'u, \"one prevailing against him (whom) there was not.\" Here the u at the end of the verb is not the formative of the preterperfect, but a relative enclitic; and it may be so in some of the instances of the permansive past which I have given. It is to be observed that the u and ni of all the secondary tenses are annexed immediately to the primary tense; whereas, if an objective affix follow, the enclitic is placed after it. Thus, in 89 L. 40, we have, after sa, i.qa.bu.su.ni, \"which (the people of Hatti) call.\" Here i.qa.bu is the 3 p. m. of the present of \u05d4\u05b7\u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd; su the affix \"it,\" which, in combination with the preceding sa, must be translated \"which,\" as in Hebrew; and ni the relative enclitic is after the affix. Were the perfect to be expressed, we should have i.qa.bu.ni.\n\n20. Other forms of this verb are i.b'a.as.su.'u, 3 m. p. present \"do not exist,\" E.I.H. 2, 20; I have also met i.b'a.as.si in the singular; and on Bellino's cylinder l. 31 we have the infinitive 'a.di la ba.s'i.e 'u.sa.lik.su.nu.ti, \"till there was none (left) I made them depart.\" In 38 I. 18, this is repeated with two various readings, i for e, and su for su.nu.ti. The singular su is very often used, when there is no definite antecedent, in the sense of \"people,\" as in 47 B. 88, etc. In 65 I. 2, 13, we have 'u.s'a.al.m'i.is (for 'usalmisu) to express the ma.da 'u.s'a.al.mi of E.I.H. 6, 43, \"the people I caused to see.\" Once more we have the l s. of the aorist of \u05e0\u05b8\u05e2\u05b2\u05dc\u05d5\u05bc in Conj. V. in 42 L. 44, 'a.gam.mu 'u.sab.si \"a lake I made\" (lit. \"I caused to be.\")\n\n21. The permansive form of this verb is most commonly\nfound in the parenthetic formula ma.la (or mal) ba.su.'u, \"as many as there are.\" I must here observe that while I have always, in common with Sir H. Rawlinson, assigned to mala an affirmative signification, instead of a negative one, as Dr. Oppert assigned to it in his grammar, I never attributed to basu'u the signification of number, as I am represented to have done in Dr. Oppert's late paper. He now admits that mala basu'u means \"all,\" though he does not yet see his mistake in supposing ba.su.'u to mean \"bad\" or \"contemptible.\" That this word and its Accadian equivalent na.la, as I read it with some small doubt, means simply \"to be,\" I feel perfectly sure. But, as this is rather a matter for a lexicographer than a grammarian, I will not discuss it here.\n\n22. It remains for me to give the forms of the permansive tense in the different conjugations; of pagil Conj. I. enough has been said; I have also given examples of pitgul Conj. I. t. Another occurs in 37 I. 66, where Sennacherib speaks of people, \"who to the kings my fathers,\" la.kit.nu.su, \"were not submissive,\" from \u1d63\u0161\u0161. The conjugation generally indicates repeated action, and the tense that this repeated action was continued for a length of time.\n\n23. The permansive of Conj. II. is of the form napgul; and of II: t. I presume it would be naptegul. I have, however, met with no instance of the latter, and only one of the former. It occurs in 40 L. 3, sa.qis n'a.an.su.zu, \"they were fixed on high.\" The root is \u1d63\u0161\u0161. The n of the root is here preserved, but it is often assimilated to the z when it comes in contact with it; and we have thus apparently, though not really, a root of which all the letters are \u1d63\u0161\u0161. In the present text, which is to me in great measure obscure, the verb quoted lies between two other permansive ones, pit.lu.lu Conj. I. t. and n'u.u\u0161.su.ru Conj. III., which, again, is followed by n'u.um.mu.ru in the same conjugation.\n\n24. The permansive form of Conj. III. is but rare: the form is paggal. Examples are qar.ra.da.ku, \"I am very strong,\" 17 I. 32; and 'al.la.ka bir.k'a.a:'a, \"my knees are moving briskly,\" 16 II. c. 30. This is the 3 f. p. from \u1d63\u0161\u0161. In the following line we have another permansive verb, la.'a\nni.ha se.p'a.a.'a, \"my feet have not any rest.\" This is from \u05d9\u05b4\u05dc in a conjugation peculiar to concave verbs, which is in the mutative parts analogous to Conj. III. of perfect verbs, but in the permansive parts has generally a passive or neuter signification. Another example will be found in \u00a7 11. Examples of Conj. IV., of which the form is puggul, have been already given in \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 17. The verbs in the last section are \u05d9\u05b4\u05dc and \u05d9\u05b4\u05dc.\n\n25. I have not met with the permansive form of Conj. III. t. or IV. t., nor of V. or V. t. The former of these I should from analogy expect to be sapgal; and the latter, perhaps, satpegal. Conj. VI. makes supgul; so, at least, I infer from the defective and otherwise irregular verbs in this tense which alone I have hitherto found. From \u05d9\u05b4\u05dc we have certainly su.lu.ku, \"they were made to go,\" 49 I. 4, 30; and I suspect su.qu.ru, in an obscure passage, 39 L. 44, to be another 3 m.p. from \u05d9\u05b4\u05dc. On the other hand we have su.ga.ku.la and su.qu.lu.la from \u05d9\u05b4\u05dc in 18 I. 62, as if the form had an additional syllable. The fact, however, of the additional vowel being in different copies a and u, suggests that it is irregularly introduced; perhaps in order to distinguish to the eye a derivative of this root from one of \u05d9\u05b4\u05dc or \u05d9\u05b4\u05dc, which were both in use; or perhaps, because the liquid l admitted a vowel before it (see \u00a7 24 of Chap. II.) I would therefore read suqlula.\n\n26. There are two verbs in a permansive tense beginning with \u05d9\u05b4\u05dc, of which the conjugation has been doubted. In the one this character is followed by qul, in the other by kun. There can be no doubt that the verbs are \u05d9\u05b4\u05dc and \u05d9\u05b4\u05dc; but the initial character admits two readings. It may be sit, and the verbs would then be in Conj. I. t.; or it may be mus, which, as a variety of examples prove, may be interchanged with mus before \u05d9 or \u05d9. Thus, mus.ki and mu.us.ki are both used for the name of the country, Musuk, Heb. \u05d9\u05b4\u05dc. Thinking that the significations of the verbs in question were not such as suited the Conj. I. t., it occurred to me that m was here substituted for s as a preformative, on account of the first radical being s, the conjugation being VI. As, however, I have found no such tense beginning with mu, or mus, and as 'u.s'a.as.kin is met with in Conj. V., with the preformative\ns before a first radical s, I am now inclined to think that the sixth conjugation has never m for its preformative, and that we should read sit.ku.nat su.bat.sun in 41 B. 39, \"their dwelling is lying;\" and in the Equinox tablet, K. 15, sit.qu.lu, (the day and night) \"are balancing one another.\"\n\n27. Of the permansive form of Conj. VI. t. I have as yet met only one example. It is in some respects a very valuable one, as it clearly establishes the existence of a permansive past, terminating in u. The nominative is singular, and there is no relative particle on which it could depend. It occurs in 51 I. 1, 32, where we have la su.te.su.ru mu.zi.e mi.e.sa, \"the exit of its waters had not been made straight.\" The verb is \u1d57\u1d63, and the form is probably sutpegul; but from the weakness of the first radical, this is not certain. I have not met with the permansive form of either VII. or VII. t.\n\n[Chapter II.]\u2014Nouns.\n\n1. In the present chapter I propose to consider the declension of Assyrian substantives and adjectives. In the following chapter I will treat of their syntax, endeavouring to show under what circumstances each of the forms, the connexion of which is explained in the present chapter, is found to be used. In a future chapter I will treat of the connexion between the primitive forms of nouns and their significations; nouns which have the same primitive form bearing, in a very great degree, the same relation in their meanings to their verbal roots.\n\n2. I think it best to reserve the full consideration of the forms of nouns, as connected with their significations, till I have treated of the verbal forms of roots; but as I shall have to speak of these forms occasionally in connexion with declensional differences, I feel it necessary to define the terms of which I shall have to make use.\n\n3. A perfect Assyrian root consists of three consonants, which are called its radical letters; and every Assyrian word derived from such a root consists of three consonants at least, and two vowels at least. Words which differ from one another only in their radical letters are said to be of the same\nform. Thus marzi and namri are of the same form; as are puluhti and tukulti; musaskin and musalbir; gabsa'ati and rapsa'ati, etc.\n\n4. If we assume a root of three letters, we can always exhibit a derivative of this root of the same form as any derivative of any other root that we may meet with. It has been the custom with Hebrew and Arabic grammarians to assume \u05d9\u05d1\u05e0 as a standard root. It was chosen on account of its signifying \"to do\" or \"to make,\" which seemed the most natural type of a verbal root; but it is objectionable on account of the weakness and uncertainty of sound of the second radical. I substitute for this a \u05dc, which gives an imaginary root, but one which is very convenient. The words in the preceding section would become, by substituting the three letters of this root for the three in each of them, pagli, pugulti, musapgil, pagla'ati; and I take these as the names of the forms to which these words respectively belong.\n\n5. All the forms given in the preceding section are forms of nouns; but there is a difference between them. One of the four, musapgil, is a primary form, or theme; the three others are derived forms, or cases. Observe that, besides the principal theme, which is singular, there are plural and dual themes, and sometimes feminine themes, singular and plural. In the present chapter I will show how the cases are derived from the theme, and to a certain extent how the theme may be recovered from one of its cases. The same derived form may, however, be derived from different primary forms. For example, pagli is a case, the theme of which may be pagal, pagil, or pagul. Had we only the words marzi and namri before us, we should have no means of judging to which of three possible themes we should trace each of them. Other derivatives of the themes in question are required before we can say that the former theme is maruz, the latter namir.\n\n6. The themes last given differ from musapgil, in that they contain no consonant but the three letters of the root. I call such themes as consist of the three radical letters, with two short vowels intervening, simple themes. Those which contain any addition, reckoning as such a quiescent letter, \u05d0, \u05d1, or \u05db,\nwhich may be considered as lengthening a vowel, I call augmented themes.\n\n7. The following are the different kinds of augmentation which an Assyrian root may have, and it may have two or more of them at the same time. First, it may have a prefixed addition consisting of one or more servile letters with a vowel or vowels, as in musapgil; 2nd, it may have a medial addition of a servile letter, as in pitgul, or in pagil, where the first syllable would be in Arabic \u0644, in Hebrew \u05dc or \u05dc; 3rd, it may have the middle radical doubled, as in paggal; 4th, it may have the final radical doubled, as in paglal; or 5th, it may have one or more servile letters added at the end as in puglan or paglit. I do not consider the at or it at the end of feminine nouns as constituting an augmented theme, but as a declensional modification of a theme. The form pugulti in \u00a7 4 I consider to be a feminine case of pugul, or a case of puglat, the feminine theme of pugul.\n\n8. There are many feminine themes of this description. Some of them are substantives denoting females, or what are considered to be such, where the true themes denote the corresponding males. Thus sa.p'i.in is \u201ca sweeper away,\u201d applied to a king, 40 B. 25; sa.pi.n'a.at is the same, applied to a chariot, which is conventionally feminine, 41 I. 82; mu.rap.pis, 33 L. 9, and mu.rap.pi.sat, 38 L. 5, mean \u201cenlarger,\u201d and are applied to the king and to the sceptre respectively. Adjectives, which always agree with their substantives in gender, form feminine themes of this description: they are, however, rarely used in the theme, either masculine or feminine. A few nouns are used in the masculine and feminine forms without distinction, as puluh and pulhat, \u201cfear;\u201d and there are several which are only found in the feminine form, as hirat, \u201ca wife;\u201d irzit, \u201ca land,\u201d or \u201cthe earth;\u201d isat, \u201cfire;\u201d amat or tamat, \u201ca sea.\u201d\n\n9. Besides these, there are many feminine themes, which have a collective signification, and may very often be translated as plurals. In 42 B. 70, we have u.kin lib.n'a.as.su, \u201cI made fast its bricks;\u201d as.su stands for at.su by a euphonic change which will be explained in \u00a7 56 of this chapter. The word\nis *libnat*, the feminine theme of *libin*, which would signify \"a single brick.\" It is not a plural, as might perhaps be thought. The plural would be, according to analogy, assuming *libin* to be a feminine, *lib.na:atisu*. Besides, it is declined as a feminine singular; and similar nouns are accompanied by adjectives in the feminine singular. It is, as I have stated, a collective singular, used for a plural. There are above a score of such collectives, from perfect and imperfect roots, in frequent use in the texts.\n\n10. All nouns terminating in *at* or *it* servile are feminine; other nouns may be so. Examples of such are *haluz*, \"a castle\" (I put the second vowel of the theme in roman, because I am not sure what it is; see \u00a7 5). In 52 I. N\u00b0. 3, 2.16, we have *ha.alzi ra.bi.tim*, \"of the great castle;\" and the plural occurs with feminine adjectives (*\u25ba* being used for the first syllable) 146 B. 6, 7. In 17 II. 32 l. we have *li.sa.an li.mut.tu*, \"a sore tongue,\" the adjective being feminine. Other examples of feminine nouns, not so by syllabic addition (or, as Hebrew grammarians express it, by motion), are *um*, \"a mother;\" *istar*, \"a goddess;\" (I believe, a loan word, originally signifying \"a star;\") *umman*, \"an army;\" *uzun*, \"an ear;\" *qat* or *qa'at*, \"a hand\" (we have *qa.a\u0161.su*, \"his hand,\" 49 B. 32 and 8 II. 45 r; the plural in the principal case is *qa.ta.tu* 8 II. 40 r, which proves that the *t* is radical), and all augmented forms ending in *ut*, as *sarr\u00fat*, \"a kingdom\" or \"reign.\"\n\n11. Nouns have three numbers, the singular, the dual, and the plural. The dual is not often used, and only, I believe, in the theme (\u00a7 5); the cases of the dual do not seem to be distinguished from those of the plural. The dual is of course most frequently used for nouns which express objects that are in their nature double; but I think that I have met with duals of other nouns.\n\n12. Nouns in the singular number have three cases in addition to the theme. I call these the first or principal case, the second case, and the third case. They are used so differently from the nominative, genitive, and accusative cases of European languages, that I think, on mature considera-\ntion, the use of these terms decidedly objectionable, as likely to mislead. Their use will be explained in the following chapter. Here it will suffice to say that the first case ends in \\( u \\) or \\( um \\): it appears from the grammatical tablets that the Assyrians considered this to be the leading form of the noun. The second case ends in \\( i \\), \\( e \\), or \\( im \\); and the third in \\( a \\) or \\( am \\). The third case is only used in the singular number.\n\n13. Before I speak of the formation of these cases from the theme, I must go back to the classes of roots. I stated in \u00a7 3 that a perfect Assyrian root consisted of three radical consonants. It does not follow, however, that every root which consists of three consonants is perfect. Not to speak of roots having for the first radical a \\( l \\), which is often assimilated to the following consonant, and which sometimes disappears altogether; nor of surd roots, as they are called, of which the second and third radicals are the same, and which have some peculiarity consequent upon this; there are certain weak letters, the existence of which in a root renders it imperfect.\n\n14. I consider \\( n \\), \\( h \\), \\( l \\), and \\( y \\) to be weak letters; I do not include \\( m \\) in the list; preferring to regard those roots in which a weak letter is found where cognate languages have \\( m \\), as substituting an \\( h \\) or \\( y \\) for it. This is the case in a few roots, of which the most common are \\( r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25} \\), \\( r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25} \\), and \\( r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25} \\). I consider the corresponding Assyrian roots to be \\( r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25} \\), \\( r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25} \\), and \\( r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25} \\); as I consider the Assyrian root corresponding to the Hebrew \\( r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25} \\) to be \\( r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25} \\). In this root the second radical never exhibits any symptom of weakness.\n\n15. All these letters are capable of causing the assimilation of the preceding and following vowels, which sometimes causes the contraction of two syllables into one; for when a weak letter has the same vowel before and after it, the two may coalesce, though they do not necessarily do so. An example may be given in the third person singular of the present of a verb with a weak letter for its first radical, suppose \\( r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25} \\). Instead of \\( r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25} \\), which would be the regular form, the Assyrians first substituted \\( i \\) for \\( a \\), assimilating the vowels, and then contracted \\( i\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25} \\) into simple \\( i\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25} \\). Thus they wrote \\( i\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25}r\\text{\u1e25} \\), a dissyllable, where a regular verb would have three syllables.\n16. So, when the second radical was weak, they wrote \\( ru'uq \\) for \\( ra'uq \\), like \\( maruz \\), and perhaps pronounced \\( ru.uq.ti \\) as a dissyllable, when the corresponding form of a perfect root would have three syllables. It must be observed, however, that when the two vowels of the form were characteristically different, an assimilation could not take place; for example, in the form \\( p\u00e2gil \\), the nomen mutantis, no assimilation is permitted. We have \\( q\u00e2'is \\), 17 I. 9, and \\( gd'i.sat \\), 66 II. 9, \u201can ensnarer (of the living),\u201d applied to a god and a goddess. See Gesenius under \\( \\text{\u05e0\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05e8} \\), 2. Examples of assimilation when the third radical is weak will be given presently.\n\n17. Besides these irregularities, which are common to the five weak letters, three of them, \\( \u05e0 \\), \\( \u05d9 \\), and \\( \u05d0 \\), are liable to be dropped altogether. In the case of one of these being the middle radical, this may always be considered a case of contraction, and it may be so sometimes when the first or third radical disappears; but the dropping of a letter of which I speak here, and of which I will shortly give examples, is not the result of contraction. Where a perfect root would have a complete syllable, though a short one, a root beginning or ending with one of the letters in question will sometimes drop it, apparently on the principle that a short unaccented vowel, having no substantial consonant to support it, is a nullity. Such Hebrew forms as \\( \\text{\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8} \\), \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b6\u05ea\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9} \\), and \\( \\text{\u05e0\u05b6\u05e2\u05b1\u05de\u05b8\u05e8} \\) will show what I mean. In the first and second, weak letters, called by Hebrew grammarians \\( \u05d4 \\) and \\( \u05d9 \\), are altogether omitted; of these letters, the latter is in Assyrian certainly \\( \u05d9 \\), and the former is possibly \\( \u05d4 \\). In the second and third examples an \\( \u05e0 \\) is written, but regarded as a nullity.\n\n18. I now come to consider the different modes of declining themes. The most natural mode is simply to add to the theme the three terminations, which I will here call \\( u \\), \\( i \\), and \\( a \\), reserving till the next chapter an explanation of the modifications of these terminations indicated in \u00a7 12. This natural declension is always used when the theme terminates in a strong consonant preceded by a long vowel, such as that of\nthe form pag\u0101l, the infinitive, or nomen mutationis, or that of\nthe augmented forms in \u1e0dn or \u1e6dt, whatever may precede the\nlast syllable. It is also used when the last consonant of a\nmonosyllabic theme is strong, provided that the theme be not\nderived from a surd root. Examples are mut, \u201ca husband,\u201d\nwhence muti; ab, \u201ca father,\u201d whence abu, abi. Lastly, it is\nused when, the last consonant being as before, the last vowel,\nthough short, is so completely separated from the preceding\nvowel, that a contraction is impossible. This happens in\nmany forms where a double letter intervenes, as tapgal, pitgul,\nmusapgil, etc.\n\n19. There are three cases indicated in the preceding section\nin which the noun is not declined in the natural manner there\nindicated. 1st, The last consonant may be a weak one;\n2nd, the theme may be a monosyllable derived from a surd\nroot; and 3rd, the theme may terminate in a strong con-\nsonant, preceded by a short vowel; and this may be separated\nfrom the preceding vowel by so thin a partition that a con-\ntraction becomes possible, and generally takes place; the last\nvowel being dropped. I will treat of these three cases in\ntheir order.\n\n20. If the theme terminates in a weak letter, the preceding\nvowel is assimilated to that of the case. Thus from \u2018az\u2019i,\n\u201cgoing out\u201d (root \u1e2b\u1e63\u1e63), we have \u1e2b\u1e63\u1e63 \u2018a.zu.\u2019u, 67 I. 2. 37. So we have from the theme which signifies\n\u201ca crown\u201d\u2014it is uncertain what it is\u2014\u2018a.gu\u2019u,\n\u2018a.ge.\u2019e, and \u2018a.ga.\u2019a in the\nthree cases. In 30 II. 19 r. we have \u2018a.gu.\u2019u e.lu.\u2019u, \u201cthe\nhigh crown,\u201d where both adjective and substantive end in\nweak consonants. Examples of the other cases will be found\nin 9 I. 5 and 21. So again from the theme for \u201cmouth,\u201d we\nhave \u1e2b\u1e63\u1e63 pu.\u2019u in 39 II. 1 l., \u1e2b\u1e63\u1e63 pi.\u2019i 39 II. 5 l.,\nand \u1e2b\u1e63\u1e63 pa.\u2019a 1 L. 14. Here also the actual theme is\nuncertain; nor is the root itself less so. Perhaps it is\n\u2018NB. If so, two weak letters would come together, and\na contraction would take place, as it certainly does in\ne.pi.si \u2018a.hi, \u201canother work,\u201d 16 I. 20.\nI cannot think, however, that a contraction takes place as a matter of course, and that we should read 'ag\u00fa, el\u00fa, p\u00fa, etc., when a second vowel is expressed.\n\n21. In monosyllabic themes derived from surd roots, or from which surd roots are derived (for I suspect that many of these themes are adopted from foreign languages, and that the verbal form, if in use, is derived from the substantive or adjective), the final consonant is repeated before the case-ending. Thus from sar, \"a king,\" we have sar.ru; from lib, \"a heart,\" lib.bu; from um, \"a womb\" or \"mother,\" um.mu. A few dissyllables also double their last letter, as agam, \"a lake,\" whence a.gam.mu, 41 L. 44. Perhaps this should be considered as derived from a quadrilateral root. The word is singular, for it is referred to by sa.\n\n22. The omission of the last vowel before the case-ending is very common. It always takes place in the forms pagal (but not pag\u00e1l, the infinitive), pigil, and pugul, and in augmented forms like muptagil, in which the second radical stands alone between the last two vowels. It takes place for the most part in the forms pagil and pagul, as in n'a.am.ri, from namir, mar.zi from maruz, and many others; but there are exceptions. In 7 I. F. 24 we have bit.su la.bi.ru, \"his old house;\" older inscriptions have la.be.ru, 20 I. 3; and it is only in the inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar that I find pa.ab.ri, 65 I. 2. 39. We must, however, distinguish the form pagil, the nomen mutantis, and pag\u00e1l, nomen mutati, from pagil and pagul, which like pagal belong to the nomen permanentis. Both forms may belong to the same root, and to the eye may be the same. Thus may be \"ruler,\" m\u00e1lik, which would make m\u00e1.li.ku, and in the feminine m\u00e1.li.kat, 66 II. a. 4; or \"king,\" ma.l\u00edk, which would make mal.ku, 145 B. 1. So dal.hu, 74 B. 13 (whence da.li.'h.tu), means \"troubled, being in disturbance;\" but d\u00e1l\u00edh, da.li.hat, means \"the putter in disturbance, the disturber,\" 66 II. a. 4.\n\n23. The three forms piggal, piggul, and puggal require special notice. The two former are derived from the third\nconjugation, and the last from the fourth. It will appear very strange to an Hebraist, but it is certainly the case, that the duplication of the second radical is very apt to disappear, and the initial vowel to be the sole characteristic of the conjugation; the forms thus become pigal, pigul, and pugal, and the first two of these generally, though not always, drop the second vowel in their declension. Thus for gissar, the intensive form of gasar, we have gisar; and in the second case gis.ri, 17 I. 1, a little more forcible than g'a.as.ri, which we have in the parallel text, 32 I. 1. The meaning is \"bold, daring;\" and we have the feminine gi.sar.tu, 66 II, a. 1. The word which is constantly used for \"enemies\" in the Behistun inscriptions is similarly contracted. It is nikrutu; in the singular it would be nikru, from nikar. So lim.nu in 48 B. 31 is from liman, for limman, \"annoying\" or \"injurious.\" But this word gives occasion for another remark. The word limnu may come from a theme limun, as well from liman; from the nomen mutati as well as from the nomen permanentis. We have, in fact, in 17 II. 32.\n\npu.u lim.nu, \"an injured mouth;\" followed by li.s'a.an li.mut.tu (for limuntu), \"an injured tongue;\" the text evidently speaks of wounds. The two adjectives are distinct in the feminine singular, which would be with active signification li.mat.tu, but are confounded in all other parts.\n\n24. In some adjectives, however, of these forms the final vowel of the theme is not dropped. I have met i.sa.ru from isar for issar. The reason of this I take to be that the initial vowel is here virtually formed by contraction. The root is \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d0; and the i of the root and the i of the form combine together, so as to form an obstacle to further contraction. The retention of the vowel in suturu may be explained on the same principle, the root being \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d0 and the form supgulu, so that two u's combine in the first syllable. It is less easy to account for pumalu; perhaps the a is long by nature, or perhaps the liquid third radical may have rendered it desirable that a vowel should precede it. I am the more inclined to\nthink this, because I find ba.ta.lum in 38 II. 74 r.; but in 50 I. 4, 28, I find b\u2019a.at.lu.ti. The theme is batil, as the feminine form ba.t\u2019i.il.tu in 172 B. 5 proves conclusively; the a before the l must therefore be euphonic.\n\n25. The feminine theme may be said to be formed from the principal case of the masculine by changing u into at or it. I am not able to give any rule by which it can be absolutely determined which vowel should be used; and in most adjectives it cannot be known, the theme not being in use, and its vowel being dropped in the cases. On the whole, however, I find at to be more frequently used than it; and I believe it is exclusively used when the theme is a nomen mutantis of any of the conjugations, or a monosyllable derived from a surd root.\n\n26. The feminine cases are generally formed by adding tu, ti, and ta to the theme, properly so called; sometimes, however, by adding u, i, and a to the feminine theme. The latter mode is the only one possible, if the theme be a monosyllable derived from a surd root. Thus from sar, \u201ca king,\u201d we have sarrat, \u201ca queen,\u201d in the theme, and sarratu in the principal case. From hirat, \u201ca wife,\u201d on the contrary, we may have hirtu, though hiratu is also in use. So also from napsat, \u201ca life,\u201d theme napis, we have sometimes napsatu, but more frequently napistu. Adjectives almost always form their feminine cases by adding tu, etc. to the proper theme, at least if the root be a perfect one, though they sometimes admit the other form also. Thus we have saplitu, \u201clow,\u201d as well as sapiltu; mahritu, \u201cold,\u201d as well as mahirtu. From dan, however, we could only have dannatu; and, on the contrary, from eli only elitu.\n\n27. The addition of the feminine case-endings to the theme sometimes causes a change in its last letter. For instance, n is changed into t, as in the instances already given in \u00a7 23; the masculine case lim.nu corresponding to the feminine li.mut.tu, for limuntu. So we have li.bit.tu, for libintu, 49 B. 52. The feminine theme is libnat. It is probable that\nd and t when final were also assimilated to t when they preceded it in the feminine cases; but the Assyrians did not in writing distinguish these letters from t when terminating a syllable.\n\n28. The letters s, z, \u0161 and \u017e, were sometimes, but not necessarily, changed to l before the t of the feminine cases. I believe, however, that none of the three last-mentioned letters is ever found preceding the t. It is changed either into s or into l. Thus in 17 II. 27 l. we have ma.r'u.us.tu, evidently the feminine of mar.zu. In 16 I. 76 we have ma.r'u.us.ta; and in a parallel text, 27 I. 92, we have ma.ru.ul.ta. In the upper part of 27 I. 10 we have ris.ti for rizti; and, again, in 12 I. 90 we have ri.h'i.il.ti, evidently for rili\u017eti. As to s itself we have lu.b'u.us.ti, \"clothing,\" 38 II. 48 m., but much oftener lu.bul.ti. A comparison of the text last quoted with 67 II. 62 must, I think, satisfy every one that these are the same word. I at one time read the initial character \u0163ib, and translated it, \"what was dyed with;\" and I perceive that Dr. Oppert and M. M\u00e9nant have done the same; but here we have lubulti matisunu, \"clothing of their people,\" just as in 38 II. 48, 49 m. we had lubusti ilutisunu, \"clothing of their godships.\" It follows that birmi, which usually follows lubulti, does not signify a dye-stuff but a material; no doubt \"wool,\" Fepfow; compare vellus for velvis (as mollis for molvis). The other word, which is commonly joined with birmi, ku.kum, or kum? for I suspect that the first character is a nonphonetic determinative of names of plants, I take to mean \"flax\" or \"cotton.\"\n\n29. The Assyrians formed their plurals in several ways, of which I will treat in succession. Some plurals are formed by the addition of n for the theme, and nu and ne for the case ending, to the third case of the singular. These are sometimes written in full phonetic characters; but very often the theme, or the principal case of the singular, is accompanied by the character . This combination must be understood to denote the proper plural form, which the reader is presumed to know;\u2014and this constitutes one of the chief\ndifficulties in reading Assyrian. Sometimes, however, as a guide to him \\( \\text{ni} \\) is added, which I read \\( \\text{ne} \\); because, while \\( \\text{ne} \\) and \\( \\text{ni} \\) were expressed alike, \\( \\text{te} \\) and \\( \\text{ti} \\) were distinguished; and it is \\( \\text{te} \\) which is used similarly to \\( \\text{ni} \\) when the plural theme terminates in \\( t \\).\n\n30. Examples are \\( \\text{dup.p'a.a.ne} \\), \"clay tablets,\" K. 116; where K. 131 has \\( \\text{hal.za.ne} \\), \"castles.\" All these tablets contain the same text. So we have \\( \\text{hal.zu} \\) with plural sign (to be read \\( \\text{halzan} \\) or \\( \\text{halzane} \\)) 146 B. 6, 7, 8. Observe that the prefixed to this word is a nonphonetic determinative. In 28 I. 1, 12, we have \\( \\text{har.s'a.a.nu} \\), \"woods;\" and in 145 B. 2, \\( \\text{har.sa.ne} \\), in the second case. In 39 II. 11 \\( l \\), \\( \\text{pa.'a.nu} \\). from \\( \\text{pa':a} \\) (\\$ 20) is \"mouths,\" as the Accadian equivalent proves; but in 17 II. 31, \\( \\text{pa:'an} \\) is used for \"a face;\" it takes, however, a plural adjective. In 33 L. 6, \\( \\text{e.mu.q'a.an} \\), \"powers,\" and in 30 II. 14 \\( r \\), \\( \\text{ri.s'a.an} \\), \"heads,\" are written in full. The singulars \\( \\text{emuq} \\) and \\( \\text{ris} \\) are in common use.\n\n31. The plural in \\( \\text{an} \\) only appears in a limited number of substantives, some of which admit also different plurals. It is, I believe, never used in the case of an adjective or of a substantive which is feminine by termination. Several plurals in \\( \\text{an} \\) are, however, feminine, as well as the singulars from which they are formed, as appears from the adjectives which accompany them. Such are \\( \\text{emuqan} \\), \\( \\text{risan} \\), and \\( \\text{halzan} \\), cited in \u00a7 30. It would, therefore, be incorrect to say that \\( \\text{an} \\) was the termination of the masculine plural. I believe that originally, in the language from which all of the Semitic family have diverged, the addition of \\( \\text{am} \\) or \\( \\text{av} \\) to the singular theme rendered it plural; and that \\( \\text{at} \\) was added as a feminine termination to both singular and plural. Thus the theme alone was of either gender, as was the plural in \\( \\text{am} \\) or \\( \\text{av} \\); but \\( \\text{at} \\) in the singular and \\( \\text{avat} \\) in the plural were distinctively feminine. From the original \\( \\text{am} \\), which was retained in Phoenician, came the Hebrew \\( \\text{im} \\), and the Assyrian and Himyaritic \\( \\text{an} \\); from\nthe av came the Egyptian u. The Aramaic and Arabic forms, in which both vowel and consonant are different from what they were originally, are probably of later origin than the others.\n\n32. Another form of the plural ends in t in the theme, and in tu and ti in the cases. Originally, I conceive, as I stated in the last section, this termination was awat or awat, and was peculiar to feminines by termination. This was in time changed to a'tat, sometimes contracted to at; but in the cases there is generally, though not always, an \ud800\udf81 between what belongs to the theme properly so called and the preceding; and this should, I conceive, be sounded as a distinct syllable. In Arabic, as well as in Masoretic Hebrew, the termination \u05d0\u05b7\u05ea or \u05d0\u05b4\u05ea is pronounced as one syllable, but the quiescent letter which is always inserted indicates contraction; and the Hebrew holam manifestly stands for awa.\n\n33. This plural in at is almost always used for feminine adjectives, and for substantives feminine by termination. It is also used for many substantives which are feminine otherwise than by termination. Thus we have um.ma.n'a.at, \"armies,\" 146 B. 4, and um.ma.na.te, 151 B. 12, from umman. In 37 II. 11, the plural of \"mouths\" is stated to be \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05d0\u05b5\u05ea \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05d0\u05b5\u05ea \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05d0\u05b5\u05ea \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05d0\u05b5\u05ea pa.a.tum or pa.a.nu; pu.u in the singular and pa.an have masculine adjectives, 17 II. 32 and 31 l. I presume, however, that pa.a.tu would take a feminine one. Irregularities of this kind are found in all languages.\n\n34. Examples of this plural when the singular is feminine by termination are zi.ra.a.te \"high, supreme,\" 33 L. 6; e.la.tum, \"high,\" 30 II. 14 r.; dan.na.a.ti, \"strong,\" 146 B. 6; mar.za.a.ti, \"difficult of access,\" 146 B. 7; all which adjectives are in concord with the plurals in an mentioned in \u00a7 31; hi.ra.ti ra.ba.a.ti, \"great wives,\" 153 B. 12, from hirat. This is a theme feminine by termination; but it must not be supposed that hir would mean \"a husband.\" The latter I take to be ha.ar, whence \u05d4\u05b8\u05d0\u05b8\u05e8 \u05d4\u05b8\u05d0\u05b8\u05e8 \u05d4\u05b8\u05d0\u05b8\u05e8 \u05d4\u05b8\u05d0\u05b8\u05e8 h'a.a.a.ru, 36 II. 40 l.; hi.ra.tum and h'i.ir.tum in line 43 l.\nare equivalent forms (see \u00a7 26), or perhaps dialectic variations, of the principal case of *hirat*, \u201ca wife,\u201d which is in the same relation to the former theme as *din* or *dinat*, \u201ca law\u201d or \u201cjudgment,\u201d to *da\u2019an*, \u201ca lawgiver\u201d or \u201cjudge.\u201d\n\n35. Besides the two plurals of which I have hitherto spoken, which I take to have been the original forms common to all the Semitic languages, there are other forms which the Assyrians appear to have developed after their separation from those who used the other languages of the family. One of these is the masculine plural in *ut* in the theme, and *utu* and *uti* in the cases. It differs from the feminine plural last mentioned in having *u* in place of *a* at the end of the theme, and \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 for \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97. The *u* is, however, oftener omitted than expressed, contrary to what takes place in the case of *a*.\n\n36. This plural is used by all adjectives and by the *nomina mutantis* of all the conjugations. All these admit feminines by termination; and it may be laid down as a general rule that a masculine plural in *ut* can be changed into a feminine plural in *at*; or if not into that, into *et* (see \u00a7 37); but many feminine plurals in *at* do not admit masculine plurals in *ut*. For example, *sarra\u2019ate* is good Assyrian for \u201cqueens,\u201d but for \u201ckings\u201d they would say *sarrane*; *sarruti* would come from *sarrut*, \u201ca kingdom\u201d or \u201creign.\u201d Examples of these plurals need not be given here. They will appear in the following chapter, and are everywhere to be met with.\n\n37. Some feminine substantives and adjectives form their plurals in *etu*, *ete*, in place of *atu*, *ate*; or, perhaps, I should say, as well as in *atu*, *ate*. In 33 I. 10 we have \ud808\udc97.\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97, \u201cto distant places (he fled);\u201d in 153 B. 12 we have \ud808\udc97.\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97; the latter word is certainly an adjective in the feminine plural, \u201cshining,\u201d or the like. Whatever, then, may be the meaning of *isreti*, it is clearly used as a substantive feminine and plural. Nebuchadnezzar speaks E. I. H. 3. 13 of having made and purified (?) the *isre\u2019et* of Babylon, and l. 65 those of Borsippa. The spelling is not exactly the same in any two of the three passages, but there can be no reasonable doubt that the word is the same. These examples establish the existence of the feminine plural in *et*; and I confess\nthat I cannot affirm with confidence anything more than that it exists.\n\n38. I may, however, mention a conjecture which has occurred to me. Can *et* be a feminine plural of adjectives used in place of *at* when they are not accompanied by substantives, but are used as substantives, with \"persons, places, or things,\" understood after them? This explains the *rugeti* of 33 I. 10, and the *muqalleti* of E. I. H. 10, 16, \"may I not sinfully incline (*ar.si*, from \u05d9\u05b5\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc) to the blasphemous persons!\" the feminine plural being used to express contempt. In a similar context in 68 I. 2. 30, *hi.te.ti*, \"sinful persons,\" is substituted. It explains also the \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9 of N.R. 8, where the adjective *an.ne.ti* cannot be attached to the substantive which follows it; but we must translate, \"these (are) the countries;\" and so in similar contexts. But how, it may be asked, can *isreti* be explained on this supposition? May it not be the feminine plural of \u05d9\u05b5\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc *isar*, meaning \"the straight places, the avenues?\" \"lightsome avenues\" well suits the context in 153 B. 12; and Nebuchadnezzar may have said, \"avenues of Babylon (and Borsippa) I caused to be made, and I cleansed, or kept clean.\" In a future chapter I will give reasons for assigning to \u05d9\u05b5\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc the primary sense of \"cleansing.\" It does not appear to me that the spelling of *isret* is inconsistent with its derivation from *isar*. So far as I have observed \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9 is preferentially used when a word begins with a radical letter, and \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9 when it begins with a servile *i*. In the Assyrian text, and in one of the Babylonian ones, the word begins with \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9; in the other Babylonian one the first syllable is expressed by \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b0\u05e0\u05b6\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9, which, however, may have only meant that the initial *i* was very long, and which, on the authority of the other two passages, we may safely pronounce to be bad spelling. I do not recollect any place in which *et* occurs as a formative of the feminine plural, which is inconsistent with the theory which I have here proposed. Nevertheless, I am far from having the same confidence in it as I have in my other statements. I can only say that if the difference between *et* and *at* be not\nwhat I have suggested, I am quite unable to explain what that difference is.\n\n39. A very common form of the Assyrian plural remains to be spoken of, namely, that in which no syllable is added to form it, but the plural cases are either the same as the singular, or modifications of the singular forms. The distinction between the two numbers is indeed sometimes made by a change of case, as will be shown in the following chapter; but even this is often not to be perceived, and the context becomes our only guide. I will first give examples in which the singular and plural are identical.\n\n40. As this identity of the singular and plural is what most persons would consider very improbable, it is necessary to give some very clear instances of it. I do not rely on such a passage as 'i.lu.ti.su.nu, \"of their godships,\" already quoted in \u00a7 28. In fact, 'iluti is here singular; derived nouns in ut not admitting a plural. In 15 I. 106, 113, it occurs joined to an adjective in the feminine singular. Neither do I rely on lib.bi.k'u.un, \"your hearts,\" 9 I. 19, though I have myself no doubt that libbi is here plural, because words which are certainly singular occur elsewhere, accompanied by plural affixes. I will, however, bring forward clear instances of plurals, the same as the singular, accompanied by plural adjectives.\n\n41. In 152 B. 2, 1, we have suk.ki nak.lu.ti, which I would translate \"well-built houses;\" but whatever be the exact translation, it is clear that sukki is here used as a plural, and equally clear that it is the second case of the singular. Again, we have in 41 B. 57, mal.ki la.bi.ru.ti, \"ancient kings,\" another example that cannot be contested. And so in 41 I. 74, s'u.u.ri ma.ru.ti, \"fatted oxen;\" in 144 B. 10, 11, yu.me ma.'h.du.ti, \"many days.\"\n\n42. In other cases forms identical with the singular are substituted for the theme with a plural sign. Thus in 38 B. 67, we have for \"gates;\" in another copy of the same inscription, 50 B. 74, ba.bi is substituted. This noun\nadmits also a plural in *at*. We have in 39 L. 22, *ba.ba.*a.ti*. Variations of this sort occur in almost all languages; and there does not appear to me to be any difference in the use of these plurals, so that one could be called definite and the other indefinite.\n\n43. A similar example occurs as to *ba.tul*, with the determinative of males prefixed, and the plural sign added, 21 I. 43; in 22 I. 109, *ba.tu.li*, with the same determinative, but without the plural sign, is substituted. To both of these words is added *ba.tu.la.ti* with the determinative of females prefixed. The meaning is obviously \"pure boys\" and \"pure girls.\" Other instances occur in which two nouns are coupled together, one of which is evidently plural from its form, while the two are evidently in the same number. Even if the passage 21 I. 43 did not exist, we might infer that *ba.tu.li* in 22 I. 109 was plural, from its being coupled with *ba.tu.la.ti*, which is manifestly so.\n\n44. The same principle applied to the formula \"oxen\" and \"sheep\" gives us two more plurals of this sort. In 67 II. 41 we have *z'e.e.ne*, the monogram for an ox, followed by the plural sign, and *z'e.e.ni*, the copulative conjunction; then comes *z'e.e.ne*, \"sheep,\" which the context proves to be a plural. In 41 I. 82 we have, in place of this, *rag.ge* \u00e0 *ze.ne*, and in E.I.H. 2. 28 *r'a.ag.ga* \u00e0 *z'e.e.nim*. The construction, it will be observed, in the last two passages, is different. Surely, it is a fair inference that *raggi* is plural as well as *z'e.e.ni*. I am rather disposed to draw a further inference, namely, that *alap*, which corresponds to *z'e.e.ni*, was only used in the singular number, and that *raggu* was used as its plural. On this question, however, I do not think that I have evidence which warrants a positive opinion.\n\n45. The above examples, to which might be added many others, must, I think, satisfy every one that the Assyrians had a plural of the same form with the singular; though there was some slight difference in the use of the cases. I now proceed to consider plurals which are modifications of the singular, not identical with it. The principle of these\nmodifications is that in dissyllables, the last of which is not lengthened by a quiescent letter, the singular inclines to have the accent on the former syllable, and the plural on the latter. Monosyllabic themes admit no such modification; nor those in which, the middle radical being weak and the two vowels the same, they coalesce in the declension into one, as zi'in, whence zenu. Nor again is this distinction possible where the last vowel of the theme is necessarily long, as in batul, \u00a7 43.\n\n46. As a general rule, however, such a noun as pigil would add its case-ending, in the singular to pigil with the accent on the first syllable, and would thus form piglu, etc., with the second vowel suppressed; while the plural would retain the second vowel; and would perhaps admit also another change consequent on this. For example nakru is used for \"an enemy,\" but nakiri for \"of the enemies,\" the theme being nakir.\n\n47. I have spoken of this distinction being rendered more marked by another change consequent on this. The Assyrians were accustomed to double the consonant of an accented syllable. This is the reason why the second radical is commonly doubled in the present of the first conjugation, as in i.qab.bi, \"he says,\" and numerous other instances, which must not be supposed to be Pihel forms. In conformity with this usage the last consonant of the noun is often doubled in the plural. Thus, in 43 I. 43, we have sal.gu na.hal.lim, \"the snows of the valleys;\" while in the parallel text, 40 I. 77, we have na.'h.li, \"of the valley.\"\n\n48. Where the first radical was a very weak one, that admitted of being altogether dropped, it was, I think, dropped in plurals of this kind. Instances of this are necessarily rare; and I am not sure that there are sufficient to establish the usage. I remark, however, that in the same nouns that could drop the initial syllable in the plural, that syllable is dropped in the singular when the noun is in what Hebrew grammarians call the state of construction. It may have appeared strange that I have spoken of the noun, when without a case-ending, as the theme and not as the construct form. I have done this\nadvisedly. It will be seen in the following chapter that the second case is repeatedly used,\u2014almost, if not quite, as often as the theme,\u2014where the Hebrews would use the construct form; and it will be seen also that the theme is repeatedly used where the Hebrews would use the absolute form. If I were, therefore, to give the name of construct form to the theme, I should be using a term that would certainly mislead. I think, however, that the theme was in some instances pronounced differently when it did and when it did not indicate a state of construction; that the theme pigil, for instance, was pronounced pigil when in construction, and pigil when not so; and I think that, consequent upon this difference, when the first radical was so weak that the first syllable might be dropped, it was dropped when the noun was in construction.\n\n49. Taking, then, 'agal or 'agil as a type of such a noun as I have described, I think we should have for the theme when absolute '\u00e1gal or '\u00e1gil; for the theme in construction, gal or gil; for the first case of the singular, 'aglu; and for the first case of the plural, galu or gilu. Such is the conclusion at which I have arrived by induction; but I give it doubtingly; the examples being few, and what others would probably explain differently from what I do. I think there are three nouns following this type which occur with and without the initial syllable, namely, those which signify \"a son,\" \"a servant,\" and \"a bull.\" From the first we have 'a.b'i.il.su, \"his son,\" E. I. H. 1. 33; 'ab.lam, \"son,\" 51 I. No. 1, 2. 16, in one of the copies, the other having the usual monogram for \"son.\" Without the initial syllable we have, I think, ba.lu.sa, \"her sons,\" in 66 II. 5. It must be owned, however, that this passage is obscure; and others would interpret it otherwise. On Hebrew and Greek transcriptions but little reliance can be placed, so far as the vowels are concerned; but I am disposed to take \"Baladan\" as authority for the theme being 'abal as well as 'abil.\n\n50. As respects the second noun, we have in 95 B. 6, 'ar.du for \"servant,\" before kan.su, \"obedient,\" where 145 B. 24 has the monogram ; also in 10 II. 15 l. we have 'ar.da, \"a servant,\" in the third case. On the other hand, in 1 L. 1,\nwe have, I think (but I admit that there is no positive proof, and others take it differently), *rid* for \"servant of (Assur).\" As for the third word, *r'i.i.mu* is given in Porter's transcript of portions of the E. I. H. inscription as the equivalent of \\( \\text{\ud808\udc97} \\text{\ud808\udc97} \\text{\ud808\udc97} \\), \u00a7 59. This group certainly signifies \"bulls.\" On the other hand, *ar.mi* is a singular noun in the second case, denoting some male animal; and it appears to me probable that it is the singular of the other word. A fourth example may perhaps be the plural *ni.si* from *anis*, see \u00a7 57. This is a case in which the few examples bearing on the question appear to throw light on one another. Without, therefore, maintaining that the positions advanced in the last three sections are established, I think that they are highly probable; and I state them here in order that they may be tested by further examples, should such occur.\n\n51. It remains for me to speak of the dual number of nouns; but here again I confess that I can only speak doubtingly. It appears to me that a dual theme in *a*, formed precisely as the third case of the singular, must be admitted to exist. I have only met with it, however, in a few nouns; *ga.ta*, \"hands,\" (where the *t* is radical, for we have the plurals *ga.ta.tu*, *ga.ta.te* in 6 II. 40, 41), *se.pa*, \"feet,\" *bir.ka*, \"knees,\" and perhaps *ma.ta* or *ma.da*, \"peoples.\" I once thought that a distinction might be established between the second case of the dual and that of the plural; but I rather think now that such is not the case.\n\n**Appendix on the possessive pronominal affixes.**\n\n52. It has been necessary in several places to assume a knowledge on the part of the reader of the possessive pronominal affixes attached to nouns. A complete knowledge of these affixes is essential to a grammatical knowledge of the inflexions of nouns; and I believe that no complete and correct list of them has yet been published. I will therefore endeavour to supply the deficiency in the following sections.\n\n53. The affixes attached to the case endings are always\nexpressed by the addition of one or two characters to those which express the noun. They are the following:\n\n1. s. \\( \\text{a} \\); instead of which we find more commonly after the second case \\( \\text{ya} \\), \"my.\"\n\n2. s.m. \\( \\text{ka} \\), and f. \\( \\text{ki} \\), \"thy.\"\n\n3. s.m. \\( \\text{su} \\) or \\( \\text{sa} \\), \"his,\" f. \\( \\text{sa} \\) or \\( \\text{sa} \\), \"her.\"\n\n1. p. \\( \\text{ni} \\), \"our.\"\n\n2. p.m. \\( \\text{ku.nu} \\); f. \\( \\text{ki.na} \\), \"your.\"\n\n3. p.m. \\( \\text{su.nu} \\) or \\( \\text{s'u.un} \\); f. \\( \\text{si.na} \\) or \\( \\text{s'i.in} \\), \"their.\"\n\n\\( \\text{nu} \\) is used for the affix of the 3. p. of both genders; it is interchanged with \\( \\text{s'u.un} \\), cf. 164 B. 23 and 165 B. 17; and with \\( \\text{s'i.in} \\), cf. 38 B. 69 and 46 B. 76.\n\n54. The affix of the 3 s.m. after an unaccented \\( u \\) is often shortened to \\( s \\); this happens most commonly after the feminine first case \\( tu \\); and the \\( tus \\) is then expressed by \\( \\text{uk} \\).\n\nOn the other hand, after an accented \\( u \\), an additional character is generally introduced after the first case, as it would be written without the affix. This character is \\( \\text{uk} \\) or \\( \\text{us} \\) before \\( \\text{a} \\), the affix of the first person singular (which, however, is not to be read as an additional syllable) and before those of the second and third persons \\( \\text{uk} \\) and \\( \\text{us} \\) respectively. Before the affix of the first person plural I should from analogy expect \\( \\text{un} \\), but I have as yet met with no example of it.\n\n55. Although this reduplication, which may be compared with that of \u00a7 48, may be used after the \\( u \\) of the first case whenever it is not preceded by a \\( t \\), formative of the feminine; there are some words, after which it occurs, which should be particularly noticed. Such are the prepositions, \\( \\text{kirbu} \\), \"within,\" \\( \\text{ziru} \\), \"upon,\" and \\( \\text{panu} \\), \"before,\" which are used before pronominal affixes in place of the \\( \\text{kirib} \\), \\( \\text{zir} \\), and \\( \\text{pan} \\), which are used before nouns. Examples are \\( \\text{zi.r'u.u.a} \\), \"upon me,\" 41 I. 45; \\( \\text{pan.uk.ki} \\), \"before thee (f.),\" 66 II. 2. 7, 8; in a similar inscription addressed to Nebo, 85 L. 15, \\( \\text{pan.uk.ka} \\);\nk'i.ir.b'u.us.sa, \"within it,\" E.I.H. 10, 12; zi.r'u.us.su.un,\n\"upon them,\" 39 I. 78. Such also is the noun of non-\nexistence yanu, whence ya.n'u.u'a, \"I am not,\" 42 II. 14 r.;\nand in the two preceding lines, ya.n'uk ka, \"thou art not,\"\nya.n'u.us.su, \"he is not.\" I may also notice ki.bi.t'u.uk ka,\n\"it is thy will\" or \"in pursuance of thy will,\" E.I.H. 10, 1;\nki.bi.tus.su, \"in pursuance of his will,\" 16 B. 141. The t of\nthis word is radical. I think it is invariably used of the\ndivine will, which was not to be resisted.\n\n56. The affixes annexed to the theme are the same as those\nannexed to the case endings, except for the first person\nsingular; and for the third person in all its forms, when the\ntheme ends in a dental or sibilant. In the last case, s is sub-\nstituted for s in the affix; the preceding consonant being\nsometimes retained, sometimes omitted, but most frequently\nchanged into another s. That is to say, the affixes of the\nthird person given above can never follow \ud808\udc8d, \ud808\udc90, \ud808\udc94,\n\ud808\udc8f, \ud808\udc97, \ud808\udc98, \ud808\udc99, or \ud808\udc9a; or any char-\nacter, the value of which terminates with any of these; but\nafter these letters \ud808\udc9b is substituted for \ud808\udc9c, \ud808\udc9d for \ud808\udc9e,\nand \ud808\udc9f for \ud808\udca0. Examples are hi.r'i.it.su, \"its ditch,\"\nE.I.H. 6. 60, or hi.ri.su, 65, I. 2. 7, or hi.r'i.is.su. E.I.H. 6. 30.\nAll these are used in parallel texts, and are evidently equi-\nvalent. The last of the three forms is, however, the com-\nmonest. Other examples are ru.pu.us.su, \"its breadth,\"\nfrom rupus, 7 I.F. 23; e.pi.su.un, \"their work,\" from epis,\n132 B. 18. It is needless to multiply them, as they are every-\nwhere to be met with. To the rule here laid down there are\nno exceptions; and the student, if he thinks that he sees it\nviolated, may be quite sure that he is mistaken as to his read-\ning of the text.\n\n57. The affix of the first person attached to a theme\nwhich ends in a consonant is generally i; sometimes a is\nsubstituted, but only, I believe, in Babylonian inscriptions.\nExamples are 'a.ba, \"my father,\" E.I.H. 7, 48; b'i.e.la,\n\"my lord,\" 66 I. 18. This affix, whether i or a, is not repre-\nsented by a separate character, but by a change of the last\ncharacter of the theme, which, with this affix, is the same as the second or third case. Examples are very numerous; but they appear to have been overlooked, or set down as mistakes, by others. I will give a very few out of a long list. In 151 B. 16, Sargon says, *ak.zu.ra *us.ma.ni, \u201cI prepared my camp.\u201d Five lines after, speaking of his enemy, he says, *ik.zu.ra *us.m\u2019a.an.su, \u201che prepared his camp.\u201d These translations may be only approximate; but there can be no doubt as to the \u201cI,\u201d \u201cmy,\u201d \u201che,\u201d and \u201chis.\u201d Again, b\u2019i.in.ti *ad.din.su, 145 B. 18, is, \u201cmy daughter I gave to him;\u201d *u.s\u2019a.az.bil ra.ma.ni, 49 I.4,11, is, \u201cI caused myself to carry.\u201d Both these texts are correct as they stand; and the emendations that have been proposed would render them the contrary. We have also qa.ti for \u201cmy hand,\u201d 10 I. 98; mu.ti, \u201cmy husband, 10 II. 4 l, *as.sa.ti, \u201cmy wife,\u201d do. 10 l. This last is for an.sati, the feminine theme of anis, \u201ca man,\u201d from which I derive the plural ni.si mentioned in \u00a7 50. All these nouns occur with other affixes, qa.a\u1e63.su, \u201chis hand,\u201d 49 B. 32, m\u2019u.u\u1e63.su, \u201cher husband, 10 II. 2 l.; and *as.sa.ti.su, \u201cto his wife,\u201d do. 9 l.\n\n58. The use of \u1e63u for \u201cher\u201d in this ancient text must not be passed over. We have also *at.ta for \u201cthou (woman);\u201d do. 10 l. This fragment of the ancient laws of Assyria is probably the oldest text in the language that we possess. The tablet, indeed, is not older than the seventh century B.C.; but it is a transcript of one of the highest antiquity. Now, it is very remarkable that, in the Hebrew Pentateuch, the masculine pronoun of the third person singular is often used for the feminine; that is to say, if we go by the written letters and neglect the Qeri and vowel points. The distinction between the pronouns of the second person, masculine, and feminine is also in several places only made in the vowel points. I think it is a fair inference from this, that in the earliest stage of the language \u201cthou\u201d and \u201cthy,\u201d masculine and feminine, had but one representative; and that \u201chis\u201d and \u201cher\u201d were expressed alike, as they were in Latin, and as they still are in the languages derived from it.\nINDEX.\n\nAmit\u0101bha S\u016btra, the, 140 ff.\nAranyak\u0101, 22, 27.\nAsam\u0101ti, Legend of King, 441 ff.\nAssyrian Dictionary, specimen of, 225 ff.\nAssyrian Grammar, specimen chapters of, 480 ff.\nAvins, the, 1\u201317.\nAtharva Veda, hymns translated, 33\u201343, 272 f., 301 f.\nAvalokitesvara, 421 f.\n\nBeal, the Rev.
