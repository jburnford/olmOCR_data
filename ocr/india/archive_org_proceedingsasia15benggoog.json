H. HOLLAND, Esq., F.G.S., A.R.C.S., in the chair.\n\nThe following members were present:\u2014\nMajor A. Alcock, I.M.S., Mr. J. Bathgate, Mr. H. Beveridge,\nDr. T. Bloch, Babu Nobinchand Burial, Mr. W. K. Dods, Mr. F. Finn,\nMr. D. Hooper, Mr. G. W. K\u00fcchler, Dr. S. C. Laharry, Mr. W. A. Lee,\nThe Revd. H. O. Moore, Mr. R. N. Mookerjee, Mr. L. de Nic\u00e9ville,\nMr. F. E. Pargiter, Babu Yadunath Sen.\n\nVisitor:\u2014Mr. H. Ludlow.\n\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nTwenty-one presentations were announced.\n\nThe proposed resumption by the Society of its original name of \"The Asiatic Society\" instead of \"Asiatic Society of Bengal\" of which intimation has already been given by circular to all members were brought up for final disposal.\n\nThe Council recommended the adoption of the proposal to revert to the original title, the proposal being fully justified by the fact that the Title-Deeds stood in the name of \"The Asiatic Society.\"\n\nThe votes of the members were laid on the table and the Chairman requested any Resident Members who had not expressed their opinion to take the present opportunity of filling in voting papers. Seven such papers were filled in and with the 96 votes returned by members, were scrutinized, the Chairman appointing Messrs. D. Hooper and L. de Nic\u00e9ville to be Scrutineers.\nThe Scrutineers reported as follows:\u2014\n\n69 For.\n34 Against.\n\nThe Chairman read the following appeal from the Royal Asiatic Society regarding the establishment of a gold medal for the encouragement of Oriental learning.\n\nIn 1897 the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society established a Jubilee Gold Medal to be awarded every third year as an encouragement to Oriental learning amongst English-speaking people.\n\nTo meet the expenses incurred in preparing a design, engraving dies, and finding an amount to produce an income sufficient to defray the requisite charges a sum of about \u00a3400 will be necessary.\n\nSubscriptions with interest of \u00a3300 have already been received and a balance of about \u00a3100 is therefore still needed.\n\nDonations should be sent to the Chairman of the Medal Committee,\n\nRoyal Asiatic Society,\n22, Albemarle Street, London, W.\n\nThe Chairman announced that in accordance with Rule 37 of the Society's Rules, the names of seventeen members were to be suspended in the Society's rooms as defaulters for non-payment of dues.\n\nThe Chairman also announced that he had received two essays in competition for the Elliott Prize for Scientific Research for the year 1899.\n\nMr. T. H. Holland exhibited and described a new Indian Meteoric Iron.\n\nThis meteorite was found by a villager near Kodaikanal in the Palni Hills, Madras, and through the help of Mr. C. Michie Smith, Director of the Madras Observatories, it was secured in 1898 for the Geological Museum, Calcutta. It weighed about 35 lbs. when found, and was covered with a coat of rust due to its having, in all probability, been exposed for some time to the weather. There is no record of its fall, but a large meteor was seen eight years before to burst over the Pillar Rocks near Kodaikanal, and it is not unlikely that this \"iron\" fell at that time.\n\nIt is found to be composed almost entirely of nickeliferous iron, with included irregular mineral masses, measuring sometimes 10 m.m. across. Crystal structures\u2014imperfect Widmanst\u00e4tten figures\u2014are developed by etching the polished surface of the iron with dilute acid; but beyond these tests, which satisfactorily establish the meteoric origin\nof this iron, the specimen has not yet been examined in detail. The surface shows the \"thumb-marks\" characteristic of the holosiderites.\n\nA certain amount of interest is attached to this \"find\" on account of the rarity of Indian meteoric irons.\n\nAlthough stony meteorites have been found in great numbers, only one other iron has been obtained in India, and that was seen to fall near Nidigullum (lat. 18\u00b0 41' 20\"; long 88\u00b0 28' 30\") in the Vizagapatam district on January 23rd, 1870. The Nidigullum meteorite* weighed 10lbs. only; its model and a piece of the iron are preserved in the collection of the Geological Survey of India, Calcutta.\n\nMajor A. Alcock, I.M.S., exhibited and made the following remarks on some insects that possess special means of scaring their enemies.\n\nThe instances of natural protection here exhibited are all well known, and I claim no originality in speaking of them.\n\nThey consist of larvae of three species of Lepidoptera which possess special means\u2014so far as one can judge\u2014of scaring their enemies.\n\nIn two of these cases the protection afforded by the \"scare\" appears\u2014at any rate in certain stages of existence\u2014to be supplemented by at least one form of disguise, making security doubly sure.\n\nThe first exhibit includes enlarged drawings of the larvae of the Lycaenid butterfly Curetis thetys. Those larvae were common enough in my garden, during last rainy season, on young trees of Pongamia glabra.\n\nIn its youngest stage the larva very much resembles\u2014both in form and colour, and also in the position that it usually takes up in or near the axil of a young leaf\u2014a leaf-bud or a fleshy stipule.\n\nIn a later stage it has a large indefinite patch of white on either side of its body which give it a certain amount of resemblance to a bird's-dropping with the usual smear of uric acid.\n\nIn its latest stage the patches of white are well defined, and except that its prevailing colour is bright green, like the leaves on which it feeds, the larva has no special disguise-markings.\n\nThere now however comes in the scaring apparatus, though it, indeed, has been in existence from the first. This consists of a pair of brushes\u2014much like bottle-brushes, or, perhaps, more like a thistle-head in seed\u2014which can be suddenly shot out from two tall chimney-like excrescences on the dorsal surface of the last segment of the body, and when so extruded can be rapidly whirled round and round.\n\nWhenever the animal is touched\u2014in any of its larval stages\u2014these brushes are ejected and worked with the greatest vigour.\n\n* Proc., Asiatic Socy. Beng., 1870, p. 64.\nMr. de Nic\u00e9ville, who has made some observations on this subject (vide Jour. Bomb. Nat. Hist. Soc. Vol. III, 1888, pp. 164-168), considers that the use of these brushes is to sweep away Ichneumon flies and parasitic Diptera. They are certainly capable of doing this very effectually, but I think they would also scare bigger enemies.\n\nThe second exhibit includes enlarged drawings of the well-known larva of the Papilionio butterfly Papilio pammion, which was common in my garden, at the close of last rainy-season, on shrubs of the Orange order.\n\nIn its early stages the larva of this butterfly is dull green smeared with white, and might easily be mistaken for a bird's-dropping.\n\nAs it grows older the markings become well defined, and the animal is an undoubted caterpillar, though two large eyelike markings on the second segment behind the head give it an ugly look.\n\nBut, like the caterpillar of Curetis thelys, it does not trust solely to its looks to deceive or frighten its enemies; but it has also the power, when it is irritated, of shooting out, from the crevice between the back of the head and the first thoracic segment, a pair of very alarming bright-red horns.\n\nThe effect is so startling, even to a man accustomed to handle animals of all sorts, that one can easily imagine that it would effectually scare a bird.\n\nThe third exhibit includes enlarged drawings of the well-known caterpillar of the Notodontid moth, Stauropus alternus. These caterpillars, which can be found in Calcutta and its vicinity in the rainy season, are as extraordinary in look as they are in behaviour. When touched, they turn the hinder end of the body over on to the back, in the manner of an enraged scorpion, and then begin to tremble as if agitated by the most uncontrollable emotion. There are certain particularly irascible ants that behave somewhat in the same way, and there can be little doubt that the suggestion, which has been made, that the attitude of the alarmed Stauropus caterpillar may be mistaken by its enemies for the offensive posture of an ant of enormous dimensions, is somewhere near the truth.\n\nThe insects that accompany these drawings are common enough, during the monsoon, in Calcutta, and I recommend them to your further notice. No observer can watch their behaviour without admiration. Of their power to terrify creatures like birds, whose high aesthetic and emotional development cannot but be accompanied by at least the germs of superstition, there can be no uncertainty.\n\nMr. de Nic\u00e9ville, in criticizing these remarks, considered that although perhaps the \"scares\" might frighten birds, their most\nimportant function was to terrify ichneumon-flies and parasitic Diptera, which were far the most active enemies that caterpillars had to contend against. For this reason he thought that the more commonly received idea that the *Stauropus* caterpillar, when irritated, resembled a spider, was nearer to the truth.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. *Notes on the Sasi Dialect.*\u2014By The Revd. T. Grahame Bailey, B.D., M.A.\n2. *Novelties in Muhammadan Coins in India.*\u2014By Dr. W. Vost, I.M.S.\n\nThe papers will be published in the *Journal*, Part I.\n\n3. *On the Anthropology of the Coorgs and Yeravas.*\u2014By T. H. Holland, F.G.S., A.R.O.S.\n\nThe paper will be published in the *Journal*, Part III.\n\nThe Chairman announced that it is proposed by the President and Council of the Society that a conversation should be held in the Society's Rooms on the occasion of the Annual Meeting on February 7th, 1900.\n\nMembers who desire to invite visitors are requested to send the names and addresses of such visitors, ladies as well as gentlemen, in order that tickets of admission may be sent to them.\n\nMembers who desire to exhibit objects of Literary, Scientific or Aesthetic interest are requested to communicate with the Honorary Secretary as early as possible, in order that accommodation may be arranged for.\n\n**REPORT ON THE PROPOSED RESUMPTION BY THE SOCIETY OF ITS ORIGINAL NAME.**\n\nThe Committee carefully examined the records of the institution and found that the Society was established on the 15th January, 1784, under the title of \"The Asiatick Society,\" for the purpose of \"enquiring into the History, civil and natural, the Antiquities, Arts, Science and Literature of Asia.\" At this historical meeting held at the Court House, Fort William, there were present, Sir Robert Chalmers, Knight, Chief Justice, Supreme Court, Fort William; Mr. Justice Hyde, Puisne Judge, Supreme Court; Sir William Jones, Knight, Puisne Judge, Supreme Court; General John Carnac; Lt.-Colonel Henry Watson; David Anderson, Esq., Henry Vansittart, Esq., Charles Croftes, Esq., William Chambers, Esq., Richard Johnson, Esq., John Shore, Esq. (afterwards Lord Teignmouth), Francis Gladwin, Esq., Charles Chapman,\nEsq., Nathaniel Middleton, Esq., Major William Davy, Charles Wilkins, Esq. (afterwards knighted), Jonathan Duncan, Esq., John Bristow, Esq., Thomas Graham, Esq., Francis Fowke, Esq., Thomas Law, Esq., Captain Jonathan Scott, Francis Balfour, Esq., J. D. Paterson, Esq., Ralph Broome, Esq., Burris Crisp, Esq., Lt. James Anderson, Lt. Charles Hamilton, T. Reuben Burrow, Esq., and George Hillarow Barlow, Esq. (afterwards a Baronet). Sir William Jones was elected the first President, and Warren Hastings, the Governor-General, became the first Patron of the Society.\n\n\"The Asiatick Society\" thus established, published its transactions under the designation of \"The Asiatick Researches\" and only modified its original title by dropping, in 1825, the antique k in 'Asiatick.'\n\nIn 1832 the Society accorded permission to its Secretary, Mr. James Prinsep, editor of Gleanings in Science \"to continue that (last named) publication under the designation of 'The Journal of the Asiatic Society.'\"\n\nIn availing himself of this permission, however, Mr. Prinsep, whilst printing the Society's resolution correctly in his Journal and inserting the proper title of the Society on the first page of the letter-press and everywhere throughout the records of the Society's Proceedings, incorporated in the volume, took the liberty of adding on the title-page the words 'of Bengal.' This he probably did with the view of distinguishing this Society from the 'Royal Asiatic Society' which had recently been started in London, with a branch in Bombay. That he did it without the authority of the Society seems clear, for the most diligent search of the records has failed to show any trace of the matter. And, on the other hand, the Society continues invariably in all its proceedings and correspondence to call itself, and to be addressed by others as, simply \"The Asiatic Society.\"\n\nWhen in 1843, the Society having discontinued the publication of its 'Researches' took over Mr. Prinsep's Journal on its own account, the existing style of the periodical was tacitly retained, without any alteration.\n\nIn February 1851, the provincial affix 'of Bengal' was printed in the Society's designation in a revised code of the Bye-Laws, but no authority for this addition can be found. It seems to have crept in by an oversight and it doubtless by this time had become familiar by having been printed on the title-page of the Journal for so many years.\n\nThis altered title, once printed in the Bye-Laws, soon came into general use, though the Society in its proceedings still occasionally continued to use its proper title, which was also continued on the first page of the Journal regularly up to the end of 1875, the Journal being entitled simply \"The Journal of the Asiatic Society.\"\nIt is therefore clear that the title of this Society still remains 'The Asiatic Society' and that the provincial designation 'of Bengal' crept into use by inadvertence and without the express authority or sanction of the Society.\n\nThe Committee after carefully considering all the evidence beg to recommend to the Council:\n\nThat our Society, as the parent of all the other Asiatic Societies, may resume in its correspondence and publications its still unrevoked designation of 'The Asiatic Society' in accordance with the terms of our foundation.\n\nObjections raised by Mr. F. E. Pargiter:\n\nI take objection to the proposal on two grounds,\u2014first, that the remarks on the past history of the Society's name are derogatory to the distinguished men who have governed the Society during this century; and secondly, that the proposal suberves no real good.\n\nIt is stated in those remarks that the addition of the words \"of Bengal\" in the name was brought about \"without authority,\" \"by an oversight,\" \"by inadvertence,\" and \"without sanction.\" It is however too much to assume that, because no express resolution or order on the point can be found now, the former rulers of the Society did not notice the change. It seems more in consonance with the facts as narrated by the Committee and more respectful to those distinguished men, to infer that they perceived that, when the Royal Asiatic Society was established with a Branch at Bombay (and another, I believe, at Colombo then or soon afterwards), and after other Oriental Societies were established on the Continent, the condition of our Society was not precisely the same as before, that other societies claimed a share in our (till then exclusive) province, and that our position would be more appropriately described by adding the words \"of Bengal.\" Those developments were gradual; hence there was no occasion for formally altering our title, but the modification introduced tentatively by Mr. James Prinsep was tacitly approved and gradually adopted by the Society. For these reasons I demur to the remarks in the Committee's paper.\n\nIn the second place it is not explained what good the proposal will subserve. We are asked to go back at one step on what has been the practice for more than half a century, yet no reason of essential importance is urged on behalf of the change. No principle is involved, nor is it a matter of any practical consequence. Neither the scope of our researches, nor our position among the learned societies, nor the\nestimation in which we are held depend in any way on whether we leave out the words \"of Bengal\" or not; they depend solely on our maintaining the high reputation of the past. I may note here that the Royal Asiatic Society describes itself on its Journal as the \"Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland;\" if then that Society uses such qualifying words, there is no good reason why we should be reluctant to retain the words \"of Bengal.\" There remains the question of sentiment, and in that important respect we shall best preserve the noble traditions of the past by holding to what was adopted by the good sense and modesty of the distinguished men who have adorned our society during the last fifty years.\n\nUnder Rule 78, which provides that \"no change in the Rules shall be valid unless a majority of three-fourths of the Members who have voted shall be in favour of the proposed changes,\" the proposal to resume the original name of Asiatic Society is not carried.\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nOF THE\n\nASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL,\n\nFOR FEBRUARY, 1900.\n\nThe Annual Meeting of the Society was held on Wednesday, the 7th February, 1900, at 9 p.m.\n\nHis Excellency Baron Curzon of Kedleston, G.M.S.I., G.M.I.E., Patron, and Her Excellency Lady Curzon, were present.\n\nH.

Watt, C.I.E., and Mr. S. C. Hill to be scrutineers.\n\nThe President then called upon the Secretary to read the Annual Report.\n\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1899.\n\nThe Council of the Society have the honour to submit the following Report on the state of the Society's affairs during the past year.\n\nMember List.\n\nOur number of Ordinary Members is 301, which is higher than any year since 1893.\n\n30 Ordinary Members have been elected, and we have lost 15 by withdrawal, 3 by death, 10 by removal under Rule 40, and 1 by removal under Rule 9.\n\nThe following table gives the statistics for the last six years.\n\n| Year | Paying | Non-Paying | Grand Total |\n|------|--------|------------|-------------|\n|      | Resident | Non-Resident | Foreign | Total | Life | Absent | Special Non-Subscribing | Total |\n| 1894 | ...     | 98         | 125       | 12    | 235   | 22     | 36       | 2       | 60     | 295   |\n| 1895 | ...     | 108        | 122       | 12    | 242   | 23     | 31       | 1       | 55     | 297   |\n| 1896 | ...     | 105        | 119       | 11    | 235   | 23     | 85       | 1       | 59     | 294   |\n| 1897 | ...     | 106        | 115       | 9     | 230   | 22     | 85       | 1       | 58     | 288   |\n| 1898 | ...     | 122        | 108       | 11    | 241   | 23     | 85       | 1       | 59     | 300   |\n| 1899 | ...     | 120        | 119       | 13    | 252   | 21     | 27       | 1       | 49     | 301   |\n\nThe names of the Ordinary Members whose death we lament are Babu Gaurdas Bysack, Mr. J. H. Gilliland, and Deputy Surgeon-General S. B. Partridge. Dr. Partridge and Babu Gaurdas Bysack were two of the oldest members of the Society, having been elected in 1862.\n\nOur number of Honorary Members is complete. We have to lament the loss of Sir William Flower, Sir Edward Frankland and Sir Monier\nWilliams; and we have elected Dr. A. F. R. Hoernle, C.I.E., Sir George King, F.R.S., Professor E. Ray Lankester, F.R.S., Professor E. Sasse, and Professor E. B. Tylor, F.R.S.\n\nThree Associate Members have been elected during the year, namely, Pandit Visnu Prasad Raj Bhandari, Rai Bahadur R. B. Sanyal, C.M.Z.S., and the Revd. E. Francotte, S.J.\n\nIndian Museum.\n\nDr. A. F. R. Hoernle resigned his seat on the Board of Trustees and was succeeded by Archbishop P. Goethals. The other Trustees who represent the Society are Mr. A. Pedler, F.R.S., Dr. Mahendra Lal Sircar, C.I.E., Mr. R. D. Oldham, F.G.S., and Mr. G. W. K\u00fcchler, M.A.\n\nFinance.\n\nOur financial position has improved, and we close the year with a credit balance of Rs. 1,52,452-11-11, which is considerably over five thousand rupees better than last year, in spite of the fact that the usual sum of Rs. 1,000 has not this year been contributed by the Assam Government towards our anthropological publications.* It must be mentioned, however, that all of our bills for books have not yet been received, and that there are some outstanding printing liabilities for publications in the press; but these do not vitiate our comparison with previous years, because we always close the year with such liabilities, and they are much less this year than usual.\n\nOur expenses have been well within the sanctioned Budget Estimate, except in respect of Journal Part I which, as usual, has largely exceeded its grant, and this at the expense of the two other sections of the Journal. This is unsatisfactory: for members who contribute papers to the Philological and Literary Section of the Journal must bear in mind that we have Scientific traditions to uphold and Scientific interests to conciliate, and that with regard to Science in general and to that part of it in particular that relates to Ethnology (Journal Part III), we have undertaken definite responsibilities that we must fulfil.\n\nAs regards Receipts, our actuals have been well in excess of our Budget Estimate, by reason of an unexpected increase in subscriptions and admission fees; for these had been estimated on the statistics of the five rather lean years preceding 1898. The non-receipt of the contribution of Rs. 1,000 from the Assam Government was balanced by an unforeseen donation of a like amount from the Government of India for the purposes of the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, to be presently referred to.\n\n* [This sum has since been received. Hon. Genl. Secy., Feb. 10th, 1900.]\nA review of our financial position will not be complete without a reference to the present value of our land and buildings.\n\nThe value of our land has undoubtedly increased, and this, which in itself is satisfactory, has lately been rather unpleasantly impressed upon us by the Municipal authorities, who have evinced a desire to hugely increase our assessment. Fortunately we have, for the present, persuaded the Municipality to deal gently with us, on the ground that, although our land may have increased in value, our building\u2014which ties us to the land\u2014has very greatly deteriorated.\n\nWe have taken steps to have our building properly surveyed, and we shall soon be in a position to make a balanced statement on this conflicting subject. For the present we can only emphasize the fact that we possess an old and probably precarious building of yearly decreasing value standing on land of such increased and increasing value that it may lay us open\u2014and this is the point that will eventually urge us into action\u2014to insupportable Municipal contributions.\n\nAn obvious solution of the problem\u2014that the land might be made to yield the means either of reconstructing our building or of establishing ourselves anew on a smaller and less expensive site\u2014will one day have to be considered.\n\nThe onerous duties of Treasurer were discharged first by Mr. R. D. Oldham and afterwards by Mr. W. K. Dods.\n\nThe Council propose the following estimates for the coming year. These, it will be observed, do not include either income or expenditure on the Royal Society's Catalogue operations, which cannot at present be decided. Nor do they provide for any repairs that may be called for when the survey of the building has been made.\n\n**BUDGET ESTIMATE FOR 1900.**\n\n| Receipts                  | Estimate | Actuals | Estimate |\n|---------------------------|----------|---------|----------|\n| Subscriptions             | Rs. 6,600| 7,744   | 7,000    |\n| Sale of Publications      | 600      | 732     | 600      |\n| Interest of Investments   | 5,500    | 5,580   | 5,580    |\n| Rent of Rooms             | 1,200    | 1,200   | 1,200    |\n| Govt.

Luzac and Co., from whom we have not yet received a final account. The value of the publications sent to them during the year amounts to \u00a371-6-0 representing 757 pieces of the *Journal* and *Proceedings* and Rs. 559-8-0 representing 811 components of the *Bibliotheca Indica*. From them we have received books and papers of the value of \u00a337-10-0.\nOur Continental Agent is Mr. Otto Harrassowitz, to whom we have sent publications valued at \u00a340-12-6 and Rs. 435-14-0, of which \u00a329-14-2 and Rs. 106-6-10 worth have been sold for us.\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe codified additions will be found as an appendix to the December issue of the Proceedings; they number 2545, of which 748 were purchases and 1797 donations or exchanges.\n\nThe extent and importance of our exchanges should appeal to those members who are inclined to advocate retrenchment in our publications.\n\nA new edition of the Library Catalogue has been energetically taken in hand, and some provision has been made in the Budget Estimate of 1900 for proceeding to publication.\n\nAll the books, except those in the Oriental Library, have been thoroughly cleaned and poisoned against insects.\n\nPublications.\n\nOf the Proceedings ten numbers were published, namely, No. 11, (Index and Title-page) of 1898, and Nos. 1\u20139 of 1899. Among other matters of interest they contain reports of the sub-committees appointed to reprint the Society's Rules and to consider the resumption by the Society of its original title, and the scheme proposed by Mr. R. D. Oldham for establishing a Standard Time for the whole of India.\n\nOf the Journal, Part I, four numbers were published; namely, No. 4 of 1898, and No. 1, and Extra Numbers 1 and 2 of 1899. The first Extra Number consists of Dr. Hoernle's report on A Collection of Antiquities from Central Asia, and is illustrated by a Map and 19 photoetched plates, all of which were paid for by the Government of India. The second Extra Number is Dr. M. A. Stein's Memoir on Maps illustrating the Ancient Geography of Kashmir. This, though it was delivered by the Press in July last, has not yet been distributed, owing to the fact that the Society seems to have been, in some irregular way, pledged several years ago not to issue the Maps to which the Memoir relates until the same author's edition of Kalhana's Rajatarangini, which it appears the Maps are also intended to illustrate, should be published by Messrs. Constable & Co. The new regulations for the control of papers by the Council as a whole will, if observed, prevent the recurrence of irregularities of this kind.\n\nThree numbers of the Journal Part II, have been distributed, containing several important papers on Zoology, and illustrated by two lithographed plates.\n\nOf the Journal, Part III, only one number has been issued.\nThe other publications of the year are a Catalogue of the Society's Sanskrit Books and Manuscripts, Part I, and Catalogue of the Society's Arabic Books and Manuscripts, Part I, and a new and revised edition of the Society's Rules.\n\nThe Proceedings were edited by the General Secretary, Major A. Alocock, I.M.S., who also, under the new rules, was empowered to give general advice to the other Secretaries.\n\nPart I of the Journal was edited by Dr. T. Bloch, who also had charge of the Coin Cabinet and reported on all the Treasure Trove coins sent to the Society. Mahamahopadhyaya Hara Prasad Shastri was Joint Philological Secretary.\n\nPart II of the Journal was edited by Mr. F. Finn, and Part III by Mr. L. de Nieville until the end of March and thereafter by Major L. A. Waddell, I.M.S.\n\nProceedings of the Council.\n\nOne of the most important pieces of business accomplished by the Council has been the appointment, at the request of the Royal Society and of the Government of India, of a \"Regional Bureau,\" or Committee, to assist in carrying out the magnificent scheme of an International Catalogue of Scientific Literature proposed by the Royal Society. The Committee, whose duties will be to select and classify, from the mass of material published in India and Ceylon, the data required for the Catalogue, will act independently of the Council in their dealings with the \"Central Bureau\" in London, and will prepare their own annual report. The Government of India have sanctioned an annual grant of Rs. 1,000 towards carrying on the work.\n\nAnother matter of public importance, in which the Council was engaged, was the advocacy of Mr. R. D. Oldham's scheme for establishing a Standard Time for all India, after the continental manner. The Society takes a special interest in this subject because it promises to ensure precision in our meteorological and seismological observations, and it was encouraged to take the initiative in recommending it to Government in consequence of the success that attended its efforts of the year 1876 to ensure some provision for zoological research in the Hydrographic Survey of India. This time, however, the Government did not see its way to approve the Society's proposal.\n\nSeveral matters of domestic interest have occupied the attention of the Council. First among these is the Library Catalogue. For some years past this Catalogue has been talked about: we have now arranged with Mr. H. B. Perie, formerly Librarian of the Indian Museum, to prepare it, in the convenient style of the Indian Museum Catalogue.\nMr. Perie has agreed to compile the catalogue and to see it through the press for an honorarium of Rs. 1,000. A permanent sub-committee, consisting of Dr. Bloch, Mahamahopadhyaya Haraprasad Shastri and Major Alcock, has been appointed to superintend the progress of the work.\n\nA new and revised edition of the Rules of the Society has been published, and for the first time the Library Rules and the Council's Regulations regarding the submission of Papers for publication have been added as appendices.\n\nThe question of the Society's proper designation, which was raised by Major L. A. Waddell, I.M.S., has given some occupation to a special sub-committee. It appears from our Title-deeds that our original designation was \"The Asiatic Society\" and that for a great deal more than half a century this was the name that we ourselves used and by which we were officially addressed. The specific qualification \"of Bengal,\" which ignores our Title-deeds, appears to have gradually established itself, but without\u2014so far as we can ascertain from our records\u2014any overt official sanction. In 1876 the Society was registered under the Registration Act, as the \"Asiatic Society of Bengal\" but there is no evidence on record that this change of name was formally proposed to and sanctioned by the Members. The sub-committee therefore recommended that the original name of \"The Asiatic Society\" should be resumed, and the Council endorsed the recommendation, which was then submitted to the whole body of Ordinary Members under Rules 64c, 64A and 65. More than a hundred voting-papers were returned, and although a large majority were in favour of the recommendation of the sub-committee a sufficient minority (under Rule 78) voted against it.\n\nAt the instance of Dr. G. A. Grierson the Council have arranged for the publication, in the Bibliotheca Indica series of a Kashmiri Dictionary. The work will be supervised by Dr. Grierson and will be printed, under his direction, in England.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Philological Committee, the completion of the late Professor Peterson's Edition of the Upamiti-bhanapancha-katha for the Bibliotheca Indica series was entrusted to Professor Jacobi.\n\nThe request of Dr. Sten Konow to retain the two Nepalese MSS. Gunak\u0101ra\u1e47\u1e0davy\u016bha and Du\u1e47\u1e0d\u012bv\u012bma\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101na for a further period of one year was agreed to by the Council; and the Buddhist MS. Sugatavaddh\u0101na was, on application, lent to the Librarian of the India Office for the use of Mrs. Mabel Bode.\nCoin Cabinet.\n\nThe Coins have been in charge of the Philological Secretary, Dr. Bloch, who reports as follows:\u2014\n\nThe following coins have been added to the Society's collection during 1899:\u2014\n\n| Description of coin          | Gold | Silver | Copper |\n|------------------------------|------|--------|--------|\n| Ancient India: Punch-marked  |      |        | 1      |\n| Kalacuri kings of Mah\u0101ko\u1e63ala:\u2014 |      |        |        |\n| J\u0101jalladeva                  |      |        | 1      |\n| Prthvideva                   |      |        | 2      |\n| Sultans of Delhi:\u2014           |      |        |        |\n| N\u0101\u1e63iruddin Khusrau            |      |        | 1      |\n| Moghul Emperors:\u2014            |      |        |        |\n| Akbar                        |      |        | 5      |\n| Jah\u0101ng\u012br                      |      |        | 5      |\n| Sh\u0101hjih\u0101n                     |      |        | 1      |\n| Aurangzeb                    |      |        | 1      |\n| Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h                |      |        | 7      |\n| \u2018\u0100lamg\u012br II                  |      |        | 1      |\n| Undetermined                 |      |        | 10     |\n| Tippu Sultan of Mysore       |      |        | 4      |\n| \u2018Abb\u0101si Khalifas:\u2014           |      |        |        |\n| H\u0101r\u016bn ar-Rash\u012bd             |      |        | 2      |\n\nTotal. 4 27 10\n\nThe gold coin of N\u0101\u1e63iruddin Khusrau and the two silver coins of H\u0101r\u016bn ar-Rash\u012bd were given to us in exchange; the remainder are presentations by Government.\n\nBibliotheca Indica.\n\nThe following report has been drawn up by the Joint Philological Secretary:\u2014\n\nTwenty-four fasciculi have been published in this series. This is the normal number which the O.P. Fund can publish every year. So the present year is a year neither of great activity nor of slow work. The only noteworthy feature of the year's publication is the higher proportion of English translations to editions of Oriental works as compared to other years. The following translations have been taken up:\u2014\n\nPrabandha\u015bcint\u0101ma\u1e47i or Wishing-stone of Narratives composed by Merutunga Ac\u0101ryya, at Vardham\u0101napura or Vadvana in Kattiyaw\u0101\u1e0d in Sa\u1e41vat 1362. It is one of the semi-historical works brought to light\nby the exertions of the late lamented Hofrath B\u00fchlcr. The writer is a Jaina, the disciple of Chandraprabha. He throws much light on the history of Malava and Gurjjarade\u00e7a during the centuries just preceding the Muhammadan Conquest. The translation has been entrusted to the distinguished scholar C. H. Tawney, Esq., M.A., C.I.E., and as a special privilege he has been allowed to have it printed in England. The first fasciculus has appeared during the year.\n\nThe other English translation undertaken this year is that of the third volume of the Muntskhana-t-Tawarikh by Al-Badaoni, under the editorship of Captain T. Wolseley Haig, I.S.C., M.R.A.S. The translation of the second volume was completed some years ago by Professor Lowe of Cambridge, and that of the first volume has just been completed under the editorship of Lieutenant-Colonel G. S. A. Ranking.\n\nThe new Sanskrit works undertaken during the year are three, two of them are works of the highest importance, namely,\u2014\nUpamitibhavaprapana\u00e7a Katha by Siddhar\u1e63i, one of the greatest Jaina writers. Siddhar\u1e63i was the cousin of the celebrated poet M\u0101gha. He was a br\u0101hma\u1e47a and a wealthy man too, being the grandson of Suprabhadeva, the Prime Minister of the R\u0101ja of \u010crim\u0101la in Kathiyaw\u0101d. His date is variously estimated by Klatt in the tenth, by Jacobi in the seventh, by Merutunga in the eleventh, and by the editor the late lamented Professor P. Peterson in the fifth century A.D. Professor Peter Peterson met with an untimely death after publishing the first two fasciculi only of this work. It has now been entrusted to Professor Dr. Jacobi of Breslau.\n\nThe other new work undertaken is the Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63yapradipodyota. It is a Commentary in the second remove on the \"Great\" Bh\u0101\u1e63ya of Pata\u00f1jali, Kaiyyata wrote a Commentary on the Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya entitled Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63yapradipa. On that Commentary N\u0101ge\u00e7a Bhatta in the last century wrote a Commentary known as Udyota. The Society has now undertaken a critical edition of this work and has entrusted it to a young Pandit Bahuallabha \u010c\u0101stri.\n\nThe third work is Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da dipik\u0101 by Kha\u1e47\u1e0dadeva an elementary work on the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 School of Hindu Philosophy under the editorship of Candrak\u0101nta Tark\u0101lanj\u0101ra.\n\nOne of the works that has come to an end is the C\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana \u010crauta S\u016btra with its Commentaries in four volumes under the editorship of Professor Dr. Hillebrandt of Breslau.\n\nTaittir\u012bya K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Yaju\u1e25 Samhit\u0101 also has come to an end. The work was commenced by Professor E. B. Cowell in 1854. On his retirement Mah\u0101mahop\u0101dhy\u0101ya Maheca Candra Ny\u0101yaratna became the editor and continued the work for a long series of years. Pressure of\nother duties obliged him to resign the editorship which on his recommendation was entrusted to Pandit Satyavrata Sama\u00e7rami and that distinguished Vedic Scholar has brought the work to a close with a complete scientific apparatus of references, indices, &c. The work has taken 46 years. Pandit Sama\u00e7rami's preface though short is extremely valuable for a Vedic Scholar.\n\nParacara Smriti with the Commentary by the celebrated Madhavacarya also has come to an end under the distinguished editorship of Mahamahopadhyaya Candrakanta Tarkalankara with indices and a preface. It is the Standard work of Hindu Law and Ritual in Southern India.\n\nThe translation of the first volume of the Muntekhaba-t-Tawarikh has been completed with an elaborate index by Dr. Ranking.\n\nThe President announced that the scrutineers reported the result of the election of Officers and members of Council as follows:\n\nPresident.\n\nHis Honor Sir John Woodburn, M.A., K.C.S.I.\n\nVice-Presidents.\n\nH.

Pargiter, Esq., B.A., I.C.S.\nThe President also announced that two Essays on the prescribed subject of Chemistry had been received in competition for the Elliott Prize for Scientific Research for 1899, but that neither of them were of sufficient merit to justify the award of the prize.\n\nThe outgoing President then delivered the Annual Address.\n\nANNUAL ADDRESS, 1900.\n\nDuring the past year we have elected 30 new paying members. Our numbers now stand higher than at any time since 1893, and they are continually on the increase. The proposals of five Foreign Scientific Societies of standing, to exchange publications with us, have been accepted.\n\nThe original papers presented for publication to the various Secretaries have been so numerous that we have been compelled to insist on compliance with the rule recently passed, forbidding the printing of any paper whatever without the previous formal and specific sanction of the Council.\n\nSeveral matters of special importance, both domestic and public, have engaged the attention of the Council.\n\nAs regards matters of domestic interest: we have amended and reprinted our Rules, in consultation with the whole body of members; we have sanctioned arrangements, which are now in progress, for a much-needed Library Catalogue; we have successfully averted a proposal of the Municipality to greatly increase our assessment; and, finally, we have taken much pains to discover our own name. The evidence of our title deeds makes for the view that we have still the right to call ourselves \"The Asiatic Society,\" but a sufficient minority of members have voted against the proposal to resume the original name and no change will be made.\n\nWith regard to matters of public interest, the Society has taken two important steps, both of them being towards the unification and consolidation of Indian contributions to science.\n\nWe have, at the request of a committee representing the Royal Society, and with the countenance of the Governments of India and Ceylon, undertaken to select and codify, from the mass of material published in these two countries, all the local data required for the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature. This undertaking, which involves the establishment, within the Society, of a distinct department with definite responsibilities of its own, has been\nsubsidized by the Government of India, and is now in working order.\n\nOn the other hand, our attempt to ensure precision in meteorological and seismological data, by advocating the establishment of a standard time for all India, somewhat after the Continental manner, was unsuccessful, the Government being of opinion that the time for action had not yet come.\n\nOur financial position has decidedly improved, and we close the year with a balance of Rs. 1,52,452-11-11 to our credit, which is Rs. 5,247-10-10 more than our closing balance of the previous year, notwithstanding the fact that the Assam Administration has omitted to pay its usual contribution of Rs. 1,000 for anthropological research. The balance looks well, but we must not forget that our building is an extremely old one and that we may any day have to face the question of rebuilding.\n\nOf the first part of the Society's Journal, dealing with History, Literature, etc., three numbers\u2014two of which are \"Extra Numbers\"\u2014have been published; but of the Extra Numbers, one, though it was delivered by the press in July, has not yet been issued, owing to a complication which is explained in the Report.\n\nThe first number of Journal Part I. is occupied by an essay by Dr. G. A. Grierson on the verb and indeclinable particles in the K\u0101qmiri language, which brings to an end this author's series of articles on K\u0101qmiri Grammar published in previous years. As to the importance of these essays, I may quote Dr. Grierson's own words, taken from the preface to a separate edition of them. \"It is hoped,\" he says, \"that, as now completed, they will be found to give a much fuller account of that interesting language than has hitherto been available. Besides those who wish to study K\u0101qmiri for its own sake, it is also of considerable interest to comparative philologists. I know of no Indo-Aryan language which in her grammatical construction is so naked and unashamed. With but the thinnest veil of mystery, she freely displays to the ardent eyes of the student, not only the general contour of her graceful form, but each joint, each articulation. Devoid of every feeling of false modesty, she discloses many a secret which is jealously hidden by her more prudish sisters of the south. It is sufficient to point out that a study of K\u0101qmiri is an essential preliminary to any enquiry which deals comparatively with the mutual relations of the modern Aryan vernaculars of India.\"\n\nThe source from which the information contained in these essays has been taken, is a grammar of the K\u0101qmiri language, written by a K\u0101qmiri Pandit, Igyarakaula by name, according to the style of native\nHindu Grammar. This work, called the \"nectar of K\u0101\u1e63miri words,\" has been edited by Dr. Grierson and published by the Society. Besides the grammar, there also exists a K\u0101\u1e63miri dictionary, composed by the same \u012a\u015bvaraka\u1e47\u1e6dha in the style of Sanskrit K\u014dshas. An edition of this dictionary has now been undertaken by the Society. Its publication is intended for the Bibliotheca Indica Series, and the work was at first entrusted to Pandit Govind Kaul, the best modern Pandit in Kashmir. After his death, the Council engaged Pandit Mukund Ram of Srinagar, who will be supervised by Dr. Grierson, to carry on the work. The Society thus may claim the merit of having done a great deal towards elucidating the grammatical structure of an important but hitherto much neglected vernacular of India, and its thanks are more especially due to Dr. Grierson, whose work in this direction is highly appreciated by all students of modern Indo-Aryan vernaculars.\n\nThe ancient topography of Kashmir has been exhaustively discussed in the Memoir by Dr. Stein, published as Extra Number 2 of Journal Part I. This Memoir is accompanied by two excellent maps prepared for the Society by the Survey of India Office and primarily intended to be issued together with Dr. Stein's translation of the ancient chronicle of Kashmir, called the R\u0101jatar\u0101\u1e45gi\u1e47\u012b, which was composed by Kalhana in the years 1148-49 A.D.\n\nDr. Stein has devoted much time and energy to the study of the history and antiquities of the Kashmir Valley. He succeeded in discovering the Codex Archetypus of Kalhana's chronicle, and has brought out a model edition of it far surpassing the earlier editions of the same work. During a series of visits to Kashmir, he has been very successful in identifying ancient places and following up, in the track of the ancient historians, the topography and antiquities of this interesting country. What he now has presented in his Memoir is a systematical exposition of the final results of his studies, as far as topography is concerned. We may be proud to count among our publications what is probably the best treatise published hitherto on any part of ancient Indian Geography.\n\nThe country further to the north of Kashmir, the great Central Asian desert, has of late become more and more important to the student of Indian Antiquities. It appears that the numerous Buddhistic ruins there contain many buried treasures, of which as yet only a portion has come to light. The discovery of the Bower Manuscript, written on birch bark in the fifth century A.D., first drew attention to this fact. Contrary to Indian experience, the dry climate of the sandy desert of Central Asia is very favourable to the preservation of anti-\nquities, especially Manuscripts, and we may look to this country for many new and important discoveries. Dr. Hoernle, the decipherer of the Bower Manuscript, was the first to recognize this fact, and it was at his suggestion and through the influence of Sir Charles Lyall, who was then the Home Secretary to the Government of India, that the Indian Government issued orders to their Political Agents in Central Asia to secure any specimens of manuscripts and antiquities that they might hear of. The result has been a very large collection of Central Asian antiquities, which from time to time have been sent to Dr. Hoernle to be deciphered and identified, and to be finally deposited in the British Museum.\n\nThe first report on some of these, by Dr. Hoernle, has been published as Extra Number I of Journal Part I. It is illustrated by 19 plates, beautifully executed in photo-etching by the Survey of India Office, at the expense of the Indian Government. The Government also very liberally contributed a sum towards meeting the additional expenses involved in printing the text of this Report, which is devoted to coins, seals, and intaglias, and block-prints. The coins are very numerous and of various designs\u2014Graeco-Bactrian, Indian, Muhammadan, and Chinese including even a Russian five Kopeck piece of the year 1758. One class, however, is of particular interest. These are copper coins inscribed on one side in Chinese, and on the other in an Indian language, the latter being written in the so-called Kharosthi script which was in use in the north-western corner of India during the last centuries before and the first after Christ. The Chinese legend gives the value and weight of the money only, while the Indian legend contains the name of the king who issued the coin. Dr. Hoernle distinguishes three, or perhaps five, of those kings, who all had a name beginning with Gugra, a word of very uncertain meaning. He assigns them to the period of 73-200 A.D. They were Uighur or Turki kings of Khotan, who reigned after the northern part of this kingdom had severed itself from its former connection with India, and had submitted to the Chinese empire. It is, as Dr. Hoernle says, owing to this fact that the Uighur coinage of Khotan was assimilated to the Chinese standard, and that its obverse legend, which had previously been Greek, was replaced by a Chinese inscription, while the reverse legend still continued to be expressed in the official Indian language and Indian-Kharosthi characters.\n\nThe block-prints are in a variety of unknown characters, which still wait for their decipherer. So much, however, is certain, that, in Dr. Hoernle's own words, they contain \"interminable repetitions of the same text, which seems clearly to indicate that in these books we are\ndealing with set formulas\u2014creeds, prayers, or incantations, or whatever one may call them,\u2014possibly or probably Buddhistic,\u2014the virtue of which was supposed to be in proportion to their repetitions.\" As regards the genuineness of these books, which has been doubted, Dr. Hoerle, after careful consideration of the evidence, decides in favour of all or almost all of the books examined by him.\n\nAt the last annual meeting, we had the pleasure of listening to an account by Professor Bendall of the results of a tour made by him and Mahamahopadhyaya Hara Prasad Shastri in Nepal in search of Manuscripts and Inscriptions. One of the results of this journey was the discovery of an old Manuscript of the poems of Vidyapati, which in many important points differs widely from the versions now current in India. An edition of this interesting Manuscript is now being prepared by Mahamahopadhyaya Hara Prasad Shastri for the Bibliotheca Indica Series. He also has published in the Proceedings of the Society a notice of another interesting Manuscript discovered by him in Nepal. It is a Buddhistic work, the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101s\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101, which was written in N\u0101land\u0101, the famous seat of Buddhistic learning in Behar, during the time of Mahip\u0101la, in the beginning of the eleventh century A.D.\n\nIn connection with Manuscripts, I may mention that a list of all the Sanskrit Manuscripts kept in the Society's Library has been prepared by one of the Society's Pandits. It has been compiled on the same lines as the Catalogues of our Persian and Arabic Manuscripts, and it is published under the supervision of the Philological Secretaries. During the last year the first fasciculus has been issued. As no catalogue of our Sanskrit Manuscripts existed, it is hoped that the present list will supply a decided want, and that it will be welcomed by all those who take an interest in Sanskrit studies.\n\nIn the Bibliotheca Indica Series, a number of new publications, besides those already referred to, have been taken up during the last year. Among them is an English translation of Merutunga's Prabandhacint\u0101ma\u1e47i, by Professor Tawney. This work, among many legendary tales, contains some valuable historical information about the kings of Malwa and Gujarat, and is often referred to in Forbes's Ras Mala. The Upamiti-bhava-prapa\u00f1ca-kath\u0101 is the oldest collection in India of allegorical stories. It was composed in Sanskrit by a Jaina author, Siddh\u0101rhi by name, in the 9th century A.D. An edition of the same was begun by Professor Peterson; but, unfortunately only two fasciculi and the greater part of the third fasciculus had been finished at the time of his death. The work is now in the hands of Professor Jacobi of Bonn, one of the greatest living authorities on Jaina Literature.\nOf Badaoni's *Muntakhabu-t-tawdrikh*, two volumes, dealing with the history of Muhammadan rule in India before Akbar, and with the history of Akbar himself, have been translated previously. The third volume, which contains a detailed account of the saints and learned men of Akbar's time, is now being translated by Captain Haig, who has already issued the first fasciculus of his translation.\n\nDuring the last year, 346 treasure trove coins have been examined and described by the Philological Secretary. The greater portion of them belonged to Moghul Emperors. It was the fashion with many of those Emperors to inscribe Persian complets on their coins. This is, however, extremely rare in the case of Muhammad Shah, and only one such coin, struck at Surat, has yet come to light. Mr. Rodgers, who edited it, accordingly doubted its genuineness, but Mr. Irvine, in a short note published in last year's *Proceedings*, shows that this coin is quite in keeping with a statement contained in the *Mi\u1e63\u0101t-i-Ahm\u0101di*, a Muhammadan history of Gujarat, and that we have no reason to doubt its genuineness. Dr. Hoey has published a note on the oldest gold coinage of India, the *svar\u1e47a*, which he believes to have been perforated pieces of gold with raised rims, similar to some pieces found by him in Set Mahet. It may be observed, however, that nowhere in India in historical times do we find perforated coins, like those of China, though we might expect to do so if it had once been a widespread fashion to use such pieces of metal as money. Moreover, on ancient reliefs such as those representing An\u0101thapind\u0101 in the act of covering the ground of the Jetavana with gold coins, we find gold coins represented as square pieces with some marks on them, probably intended for something like the so-called \"Punch-marked\" coins, of which, however, only pieces in silver or mixed metal have yet been discovered.\n\nFinally, I may mention a short paper by Dr. Waddell, published in the *Proceedings*. Its object is to prove the identity of Upagupta, the high-priest of A\u015boka according to northern Buddhistic tradition, with Mogalliputta Tissa of the Pali Literature.\n\nThe Rev. H. B. Hyde published a note on the first marriage of Warren Hastings with the widow of Captain Buchanan, one of the victims of the Black Hole, and gave a revised list of the victims of that disaster. We may hope that Mr. Hyde will extend to the antiquities of Madras the talent for research which he displayed so conspicuously in Calcutta.\n\nPart II. of the Journal has this year risen to three numbers, and a portion of the grant is still unexpended; some important papers have been published.\n\nMajor Alcock, I.M.S., has continued his contributions to Indian\nCarcinology, and has published three papers, two of which are finished monographs, according to modern standards, of the groups with which they deal, namely the *Brachyura Cyclometopa* and the *Brachyura Primigenia* or *Dromiacea*. The third is of more general and bionomic interest, and refers to the subject of commensalism between Zoophytes and Hermit crabs.\n\nMr de Nic\u00e9ville has worthily continued his work on Oriental Lepidoptera by a List of the Butterflies of Ceylon, and a brief paper by Dr. Hooper on the ancient drug Akakia has revived a branch of our subject which has long been without contributions.\n\nFor the rest, Ornithology has been unusually to the fore this year. The birds of Manipur form the subject of a paper communicated by Lieut. H. H. Turner, and a short note by Captain H. S. Wood, I.M.S., gives a much-needed account of the rare Hume's Bush-quail (*Microperdix manipurensis*) of that State. Lastly, the Natural History Secretary, Mr. Finn, has been able to make several ornithological exhibits, often of living birds, including specimens of the rare Bronze-Cap (*Eunetta fulcata*) and Clucking (*Nettium formosum*) Teals; and has described a new species of Bhimraj or Racket-tailed Drongo (*Dissemurus alcocki*) and also what has turned out to be the long-unknown summer-plumage of Hume's large Weaver-bird (*Ploceus megarhynchos*).\n\nThe biological work of the Indian Marine Survey is so intimately connected with the history of the Society that its progress during the year may be appropriately referred to here.\n\nThe long series of deep-sea investigations, which the Survey has been patiently carrying on for nearly fifteen years, and the results of which have hitherto been known only through preliminary communications, are now beginning to culminate in important monographs, the interest of which is quite as much bionomic and zoogeographical as faunistic. During the year there have been published volumes on the Deep-sea Madreporaria, the Deep-sea Brachyura and the Deep-sea Fishes by Major Alcock, and on the Deep-sea Ophiuroidea, by Dr. R. Koehler of Lyons.\n\nBesides this, Major Alcock has published in the \"Scientific Memoirs by Medical Officers of the Army of India\" a summary of the Deep-sea Zoological work of the Survey.\"\n\nThe circular issued by the Society has borne fruit in a number of papers on folk-lore, which will be welcome to the numerous students in Europe who are at work on this fascinating subject. I may mention here that Mr. A. M. Jackson of the Bombay Civil Service, a well-known scholar and ethnologist, has had the circular translated and sent round to a number of village school-masters in Gujerat, whose replies\nhe will collate and examine as soon as he can find time to do so. The example is one that might be followed with advantage. In India, as in Europe, the great object of enquiries such as the circular suggests is to preserve and record those unwritten legends, superstitions, and traditions, the memory of which fades as popular education spreads. There is a certain fitness in employing the Guru Mah\u0101saya to preserve that which it is his official function to destroy, and he has unrivalled opportunities for procuring exactly the information which we want.\n\nMr. Friend-Pereira's translations of some Khond (Kandh) songs enshrine some curious fragments of history and superstition which in a generation or two will probably have been forgotten. Passing by the lover's entreaty that the girl he is courting will 'gladden his liver by moving her body in the dance,' which recalls Horace's moral counsel \"Non ancilla tuum jecur ulceret ulla, puerve,\" we find a reference to the P\u00e1ns, the helots of the Kandhs, who worked for them as weavers, and furnished the Meriah who was sacrificed to ensure good crops and general prosperity. The hymn to the earth god, which follows, is a revised version of an earlier and more ghastly hymn in which the human victim was apostrophised by the worshippers. It refers, however, to the original practice and its abolition by the \"saheb sons\" and \"path\u00e1n sons,\" the latter being probably Muhammadan sepoys employed on the suppression of human sacrifice, and it seems probable enough that the verses describing the magical effect of the tears and blood of the victim may have been simply passed on from the earlier hymn.\n\n\"Thou hast come, thou hast come, O curved-horn buffalo;\nTo thy death thou hast come.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAt present through fear of the saheb sons\nFrom thy shoulder we take the flesh;\nThrough fear of the path\u00e1n sons\nFrom thy cheek we take the flesh.\nIn the country of former times\nWe used to bury a human being.\nDo not cry out to me, O beautiful buffalo;\nDo not cry out to me, O curved-horn buffalo.\nAs the tears streams from thine eyes,\nSo may the rain pour down in At\u00e1r;\nAs the mucus trickles from thy nostrils,\nSo may it drizzle at intervals;\nAs thy blood gushes forth,\nSo may the vegetation sprout;\"\nAs thy gore falls in drops,\nSo may the grains of rice form.\n\nO demon of the refuse heap,\nO demon of the dung-hill,\nGo you to sleep, go you to sleep.\nFor twenty years sleep thou,\nO demon of the refuse heap;\nFor twelve years sleep thou,\nO demon of the dung-hill.\nKeep illness away, keep fever away,\nTo you will I sacrifice a beautiful buffalo.\nDo not touch the children\nBe as one dead, O earth-god;\nDo not touch the little ones\nO earth-god, O deaf, unheeding earth-god.\n\nIt is an excellent illustration of that singular system of departmental bogeydom which people have now agreed to call by the not very suitable name of animism, that the demons of the refuse-heap and the dung-hill should be entreated by sacrifice to keep illness and fever away. On this Mr. Friend-Pereira observes in a note, \"It is remarkable that the Kandhs know that filth and decaying refuse are the principal factors in causing epidemic diseases. And yet their villages are anything but clean.\" But surely the Kandhs do not know anything of the kind. If they did they might perhaps remove their dung-hills. As it is they doubtless regard them as the homes of the fever demon whom they would naturally be reluctant to disturb, and it is the demon and not the dirt that in their view causes the fever. Having offered a suitable sacrifice they have done their part and must leave the rest to the heads of the fever department. That is the theory of the thing, and the practice too among most wild people that I know of. But I hope Mr. Friend-Pereira will inquire further. It looks as if he were on the track of very interesting discoveries.\n\nI must permit myself one more extract which describes the administration of the Kandh country by Captain Campbell (Kaibon Sahib) in 1836-42 and Captain Macpherson (Mokodella Sahib) who succeeded him in 1842 and was the first agent for the suppression of human sacrifice and female infanticide under Act XXI. of 1845.\n\nAt the time of the great Kaibon Saheb's coming the country was in darkness; it was enveloped in mist.\nAnd how was the country enveloped in mist?\u2014there was murder and bloodshed; conflagration of villages; destruction of rice and crops.\nBrothers and uncles sat together and deliberated how they were to act.\n\nWhile they were discussing whether they would live or die the great Kaibon Saheb came.\n\nAll the people fled in terror; the Saheb said, \"brothers, uncles, fear not; Maliko Knaro come to me.\"\n\nHaving sent paiks to collect the people of the land (they), having surrounded them, caught the meria sacrificers.\n\nHaving caught the meria sacrificers, they brought (them); and again they went and seized the evil councillors.\n\nHaving seen the chains and shackles the people were afraid; murder and bloodshed were quelled.\n\nThen the land became beautiful; and a certain Mokodella Saheb came.\n\nHe destroyed the lairs of the tigers and bears in the hills and rocks, and taught wisdom to the people.\n\nAfter the lapse of a month he built bungalows and schools; and he advised them to learn reading and law.\n\nThey learnt wisdom and reading; they acquired silver and gold; then all the people became wealthy.\n\nWe may I think point to that as a monumentum \u00e6re perennius not merely of the pacification of the Kandhmals by the men whose names are still had in remembrance in curiously travestied forms by a grateful people, but of the methods to which British officers owe their success in dealing with primitive folk all over the world. We are greatly indebted to Mr. Friend-Pereira for rescuing from oblivion this and other Kandh songs, and I am sure you will join me in the hope that he will pursue his researches in a region which promises so well.\n\nI am indebted to Mr. Holland for the following abstract of his paper on the Coorgs and Yeruvas which promises to do much to clear up the Ethnology of Southern India.\n\n\"In the little province of Coorg, which embraces a semi-isolated portion of the Western Ghats of South India, we have an interesting instance of the way in which a mountainous and jungle-covered country has been turned to totally different purposes by two distinct races. Like many of the aboriginal tribes of South India who have been compelled to retire to the unhealthy hills before the southward spread of the Aryans, the Yeruvas found in Coorg an asylum of refuge from the aggressive invaders, whilst the Coorgs, besides finding in the thick jungles the means for satisfying their hunting propensities, regarded the small plateau, with its steep and narrow approaches, as a natural point d'appui for predatory excursions into the country of their wealthier,\nbit less warlike, neighbours living on the rich agricultural lowlands around.\n\n\"The sporting and fighting proclivities of the Coorgs reveal themselves even in their festive and religious ceremonies. From his very birth, when a bow-and-arrow made from the castor-oil plant is placed in the hands of the small baby-boy, the Coorg male is, or at least in the old days was, regarded as a huntsman and a warrior, whose first pride should be in his size and physical strength. The selective influences arising from this have combined with many healthy habits to make the Coorgs the finest race, without exception, in South India.\n\n\"The unique privileges they enjoy in the system of administration, and, amongst other things, their exception from the provisions of the Disarming Act which was enforced after the Mutiny, are merely present-day expressions of the peculiarities in history which have distinguished Coorg from the rest of South India; and, assuming that the history of a country is necessarily dependent on native character, it is interesting to find by actual measurement that the Coorg people occupy amongst the races of South India a completely isolated position in regard to their physical characters as they do in history, tradition, customs and dress.\n\n\"The extensive and excellent researches by Mr. E. Thurston in the Madras Presidency enable us to show that there is at any rate no consanguinity between the Coorgs and the Dravidian races of the South. The traditions concerning their origin bear the stamp of comparatively recent manufacture, and their language being now a dialect of the Canarese prevalent in that region, we have no clue to their origin. Until, therefore, further anthropometric researches have been made in Peninsular India, the social affinities of the Coorgs must remain undetermined.\n\n\"The average height of the Coorg man is 168\u00b77 cm. (5 ft. 6\u00bd in.), which is only equalled by the Todas (169\u00b76 cm.) amongst the native races of South India, all other tribes being below 165 cm. Their nasal index (72\u00b71) is of a higher type than any of the people of the South except the nomadic Lambadis (69\u00b71), who have a fair skin and speak an Aryan language, and the Sheik Mahomedans (70) who claim to be descendants of recent immigrants from the North. Regarded as percentages of the stature, they have a distinctly shorter foot, shorter fore-arm, and narrower span than the other tribes, and these characters are approximately coincident with what we generally consider to be concomitants of racial superiority. In many of these points the Coorgs are closely approached by the Todas; but they are sharply distinguished from these peculiar people by showing the only approach to brachy-\ncephalism so far discovered in South India. With an average cephalic index of 79\u00b79, the Coorgs just escape inclusion in Broca's class of sub-brachycephali. Of the other races in South India measured by Thurston, none is even mesaticephalic, whilst the Todas are decidedly dolichocephalic. The small tribe of 32,000 Coorgs thus occupy a completely isolated position amongst the races of the South.\n\n\"For the purpose of detecting any traces of aboriginal blood in the Coorgs I have made a comparative examination of the next largest caste in the province\u2014the Yeruvas, with whom the Coorg have been in close contact from time immemorial. The Yeruvas in physical measurements and ethnographical characters fall into a group with the Kurumbas, Irulas, Paniyans and Kadirs\u2014people of a very dark colour, curly hair, thick, slightly everted lips, feeble prognathism, distinctly platyrhine noses (index 89\u00b76), low stature (158\u00b77 cm.), and comparatively long feet, long fore-arms, wide span and dolichocephalic cranium (73\u00b76). By selecting from amongst the Coorgs those whose nasal indices are higher, more platyrhine, more aboriginal so to speak, than the average, and from these picking out the individuals more dolichocephalic, that is also more aboriginal, than the average, we find that in the comparative length of arm, span, foot, and size of chest these do not show the slightest average tendency towards the Yeruva type. Conversely, by selecting from amongst the measured Yeruvas, those which have a higher type of nose than the average and from these separating the specimens which show a tendency towards brachycephalism, we find that in the other characters which distinguish the two tribes these Yeruvas do not show the slightest Coorg affinity. The actual figures will appear in the paper; but meanwhile it should be stated that these statements refer to averages; for whilst I have not found a single Yeruva who uniformly shows a tendency towards Coorg characteristics, I have met with two individuals with Coorg names, who, besides having longer heads and broader noses than their fellow-tribesmen, show also in all other points a tendency to conform to aboriginal characteristics. Accidents will of course happen in all communities; but I look upon the results of these experiments as a confirmation of Mr. Risley's assumption that the marriage customs resulting from the rigid observance of caste regulations render the methods of anthropometry superior in accuracy to all other forms of anthropological research, and on this account India offers an unusually favourable field for physical measurements.\n\n\"Whilest the origin of the Yeruvas clearly becomes part of 'the Dravidian problem,' the unique position of the Coorgs remains unexplained. Assuming that the tall, fair, dolichocephalic people of the...\"\nPanjab are actual descendants of the original Aryan invaders, Mr. Risley has traced the so-called Aryan type fading out in the direction of Bengal, where it comes into contact with Dravidian and Mongolian elements. But the recent researches of European anthropologists do not leave undisputed the assumption that the people who spoke the undivided Aryan tongue were dolichocephalic. On the contrary, many authorities profess to trace the source of the Aryan languages to the tall brachycephali who built the pile-dwellings of the Swiss and Italian lake country, and who showed their intellectual superiority to dolichocephalic Teutons by the domestication successively of the ox, the goat, sheep, pig, and horse; by the use of superior implements; by the practice of agriculture; and by other signs of a progressive civilization. Is it possible, then, that the Coorgs are a last remnant\u2014a small \"outlier,\" to use an equivalent geological term\u2014of the original Aryan invasion, and that the tall, fair, dolichocephalic tribes of the Punjab are a subsequent intrusion of people who, like the Teutons of Europe, had meanwhile adopted an Aryan language? The chain of evidence to support this assumption must necessarily have many weak links; but the discovery of the Coorgs shows that, besides the comparatively recent, so-called Aryan, trespass on Dravidian territory, there is a chapter in the anthropological history of India which remains still to be deciphered.\n\nI desire to add my testimony to that of Mr. Holland as to the great value of Mr. Thurston's anthropological work in Madras. In his report on the administration of the Government Museum at Madras for the year 1898-99, Mr. Thurston gives only too brief an account of his recent operations. He made a tour last year among the Malayalis of the Shevaroy hills, who, though calling themselves hill-people and living on the summit and slopes of the hills, turn out to be merely Tamils who migrated from the plains\u2014probably from Conjeveram\u2014in comparatively recent times. Can it be that the affectation of coyness with which these people received Mr. Thurston was due merely to the apprehension that their pretensions to be genuine hill-men were about to be unmasked? On the Malabar coast Mr. Thurston examined Cherumans, Tiyans and Eurasians\u2014the latter a type which anthropologists have as yet taken little notice of. He went on to deal with the Kadirs of the Anamalai hills, \"the existing remnant of a once more numerous race.\" These people alone in India resort to the practice common in Africa and the Malay Archipelago of chipping the incisor teeth of both sexes to a sharp point. They also climb trees by means of pegs in a fashion which corresponds in every detail to that followed by the Dyaks of Borneo.\nIt is a matter for congratulation that an area which promises to prove exceptionally rich in all kinds of survivals should have been taken in hand by such competent inquirers as Messrs. Holland and Thurston. To their names I may add that of Mr. Mullaly, now Assistant Inspector-General of Police in Madras, whose researches among the criminal tribes of the Presidency are well-known and have an interest far beyond the limits of his Department.\n\nAn equally interesting and even less-known area on the north-east frontier, the valley of the Brahmaputra and the adjacent ranges of hills, has been taken in hand by our Anthropological Secretary, Major Waddell, who is specially qualified for the task by his anthropometric researches among the Himalayan tribes of Sikkim, Eastern Nepal, and British Bhutan, the Kochh of Northern Bengal, Tibetans from all parts of Tibet, including the valley of the Tsangpo, the Upper Brahmaputra, and also most of the tribes of Burma as far up as the Kachins or Siugphos above Bhamo on the confines of China and Assam. Major Waddell\u2019s observations, which will be published in an early number of the Journal of the Society, will furnish exact details of the physical type of the tribes of Assam and the Brahmaputra Valley and will include a record of the colour of the skin and eyes\u2014the first attempt of the kind in India. The opening paragraphs of his paper, which he has kindly permitted me to quote, describe the almost untouched field which his researches will open up:\n\n\u201cFew of the wilder parts of the world, still left, preserve such a vast variety of savage tribes of such great ethnological interest as the mountainous valley of the mighty Brahmaputra, in its course from Lower Tibet to the Bay of Bengal. And in few localities has the war of races raged more fiercely.\n\n\u201cThis hilly region, standing up between China, India, Tibet, and Burma, has come to be the last refuge of scattered families of the more primitive hordes from each of those countries. Driven into these wild glens, by the advance of civilization up the plains and lower valleys, they have been hemmed in among the mountains, where, pressing on each other in their struggle for existence, they have developed into innumerable isolated tribes, differing widely in appearance, customs and language; but all alike engaged in blood-thirsty feuds, head-hunting, and murderous raids on their more defenceless neighbours. Many of them are of that extremely barbarous type which is popularly associated with South Africa. Almost equally painful, too, was the condition of the rich plain fringing the great river\u2014the plain of Assam whose history\n\n1 Journ., Anthropol. Inst., Vol. xx. (1891), p. 241.\nup till the British occupation, was one long tale of inter-tribal conflict, invasion and cruel extermination.\n\n\"These wild hillmen, however, bordering the valley, were little affected by the British occupation for a long time. They proved to be so hostile, and their country so impenetrable, that, although a large section of their mountains had for many years lain nominally within the British territory of Assam and North-Eastern Bengal, our Government was content to leave them and their country alone, except for an occasional expedition and the establishment of a few military outposts, to punish a particular tribe for raiding or massacring British subjects.\n\n\"Since, however, the extension of the tea industry and other European interests in Assam, and still more so since the annexation of Upper Burma in 1886, the Indian Government has been actively opening up and settling that large section of these mountains on the southern side of the valley, between Assam and Upper Burma, in order to put a stop once for all to that murderous raiding by the tribes, which has been a perpetual terror and menace to all civilization in their neighbourhood.\n\n\"Following disarmament and the military occupation of several parts of the hills, roads and, latterly, that most powerful of all disintegrating social factors\u2014the railway\u2014are being rapidly pushed through amongst the dreaded hills. And this development is not likely to relax, for this tract is on the direct route from India to the heart of China. Already, it is said to be no uncommon sight to see a Naga who only two or three years ago was a naked head-hunting savage of the most pronounced type, now clad in a tweed coat and carrying a Manchester umbrella, taking his ticket at a railway station.\n\n\"Unfortunately for science, however, no steps are being taken to record the rare vestiges of prehistoric society which still survive here; but which are in danger of being swept away by our advancing civilization. Beyond a few fragmentary lists of words in several of the dialects and some grammars, which after all are of secondary importance, extremely little is known of the most interesting tribes in this part of Indo-China. The little that is known is just sufficient to show that some of them are in many respects in a much more primitive condition than the wildest tribes of India; and that here, almost at our very doors, is a unique mine of unexplored material to yield the very kind of unrecorded information which Professor Tylor and those others who have raised Anthropology to a science, have shown the urgent necessity for fixing without delay; and for which they have been ransacking the few remaining wilder parts of the world before the surviving traces of prehistoric usage are irretrievably lost.\"\n\"Thus, for example, in this part of Indo-China still persists, amongst the Garos, Khasias and the wilder Koch tribes, that once widespread stage of primitive society, about which so little is known\u2014the 'maternal'\u2014in which descent is traced through the mother, and not through the father, as in civilized society, thus implying a somewhat promiscuous state of the family. Others again, such as the Miris, are in a transition-stage from the maternal to the paternal. They retain survivals of the maternal stage; but appear only recently to have adopted the paternal. For, as if to emphasise the change and to show that the father has a direct relation to his child, the father is represented as a second mother and goes through the fiction of a mock child-birth, the so-called cowade. He lies in bed for forty days, after the birth of his child; and during this period he is fed as an invalid. The Kukis and 'Kacha' Nagas seem also to be more or less in this transition-stage while the other Naga tribes appear to be in a more communal state, the exact nature of which, however, as well as its relation to the others, is not yet clear. And adjoining tribes practise polyandry, polygamy, and the Levirate.\"\n\nI should like to commend this sketch of the material awaiting the ethnologist in Assam to the notice of my friend Mr. Andrew Lang, who said to me in England the other day, \"You have got nothing primitive in India.\" One may fairly ask in reply what is it that entitles people to pose as primitive? If dispensing with clothes is the test we may point to the 'naked' tribe of Nagas described by Mr. Davis, who are nude and antique enough to satisfy anybody; to the Juangs of Keanjhar, whose women until quite recently wore nothing but a couple of bunches of leaves stuck under a girdle of beads; and to the curious survival mentioned by Mr. Clayton in Part III. of the Journal for last year, where he describes how at the temple of the goddess Bavaniyamal, in a village only sixteen miles from Madras, the worshippers, including Brahmans and the respectable agricultural caste of Vellalas strip themselves naked and circumambulate the shrine clad only in leaves of the sacred neem tree (Azadirachta Indica). If eccentric modes of marriage are the point to be looked to, we have in India a large and varied selection embracing both forms of polyandry, the fraternal and the promiscuous, the latter of which has given rise in Malabar and in the north of Ceylon to an elaborate law of property under which a man's proximus haeres is his sister's son. In Bengal an equally elaborate law has arisen from a system of ancestor worship, none the less primitive for the fact that its development, so far from being arrested, seems to have been stimulated by the fostering care of the Privy Council. Exogamy prevails everywhere in forms which are instructive for their variety and for the light which they throw upon\nthe probable origin of the practice. Totemism survives over large areas among strong and well organised tribes who show no signs of dying out and on occasion assert themselves with inconvenient vigour. As for taboo, which is usually considered to be one of the distinctive characters of primitive man, the whole country is alive with it; and the caste system itself may be plausibly described as nothing more than a highly specialised and complicated application of the same principle.\n\nBefore leaving this branch of the subject I should like to make mention of the very admirable ethnographic work that has been done in the series of Caste Hand-books for the Indian Army, by Major Vansittart, Captain Bingley and Captain Nicholls, and to express a hope not only that that work may be continued so as to give us a complete account of all the tribes and races represented in the Indian Army, but also that officers with a taste for such studies will pursue them on the lines laid down in 1885 at the Lahore Conference on Ethnography by Mr. Ibbetson, Mr. Neafield and myself and will send us from time to time for publication in the Journal notes or monographs giving the results of their inquiries.\n\nHaving reviewed in a rather summary fashion the work done by our Society and by others during the year I shall now take a dip into the future and sketch what I think ought to be done and might be done, at no great cost and without putting any undue strain on existing machinery, to open up and render accessible to the world the great store of ethnographic facts which India still offers to those who are willing to seek for them. In doing this I shall take as my text the following letter (the substance of which was published in the Times some months ago) which my friend Sir George King informs me has been addressed by the Council of the British Association to the Secretary of State for India.\n\n\"At the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Dover, attention was called to the special opportunity offered by the Census about to be taken in India for collecting valuable ethnographical data concerning the races of the country; and the Council of the Association having taken the matter into consideration, and being impressed by its scientific importance, have requested me, on their behalf, to bring to the notice of Her Majesty's Government the valuable scientific results which might be obtained by means of the Census.\n\n\"The results of the Census itself constitute, of course, by their very nature, an ethnographical document of great value; and my Council feel that, without overburdening the Officers of the Census or incurring any very large expense, that value might be increased to a\nvery remarkable degree if to the enumeration were added the collection of some easily ascertained ethnographical data. They are encouraged to make this suggestion by the reflection that the Census Commissioner is an accomplished ethnographer, well known by his publication on the Tribes and Castes of Bengal, the valuable results of which would be supplemented by the inquiries now proposed. They feel confident that with his aid, and under his direction, most important data may be obtained at a minimum of effort and cost. I may add that should the suggestion which my Council desire to make be carried out, a great step will have been taken towards establishing a uniform method of ethnographical observation in India\u2014a matter of great scientific importance.\n\n\"Stated briefly, what my Council desire to see carried out is as follows:\u2014\n\n\"1. While collecting the ordinary information for the Census, to obtain such data of the physical and sociological characters of the jungle races\u2014Bhils, Gonds, and other tribes of the central mountain districts\u2014concerning which our information is at present very limited. These data would furnish the basis for a true estimation of the number and distribution of the tribes in question, and thus powerfully contribute to a sound classification of the races of India.\n\n\"2. In a similar manner to verify and add to the knowledge which we already possess of the Naga, Kuki, and other cognate races of the Assam and Burmese frontiers, and of the vagrant and criminal tribes\u2014Haburas, Beriyas, Sansiyas, &c.\u2014in North and Central India.\n\n\"3. To collect physical measurements, particularly of the Dravidian tribes, and of the Rajputs and Jats of Rajputana and the Eastern Panjab. Such data will be of the greatest service, in throwing light on the important and difficult problem of the origin of these tribes and their relation with the Yu-echi and other Scythian races.\n\n\"4. To obtain, so far as can be done without too great labour and expense, a series of photographs of typical individuals of the various races, and if it should be practicable, of views of archaic industries, &c. This, which might be accomplished by placing photographers at the service of the Census Officers, would be the commencement of an Ethnological Survey of India similar to and certainly no less important than the Archaeological Survey of which the Government of India may so justly be proud.\n\n\"My Council, in considering the above proposal, have been assisted by a Committee of gentlemen possessing special knowledge of the subject in question, and I am to add that this Committee will be pleased to place themselves at the disposal of Her Majesty's Government to\nassist in the proposed investigation. If it should seem desirable to Her Majesty's Government, the Committee are prepared to put themselves into direct communication with the Officers of the Census, who, however, the Council have reason to believe, are fully capable of carrying out the details of the investigations proposed.\"\n\nIt will be seen that the proposals of the Association comprise\n\n(1) Ethnography, or the systematic description of the history, structure, traditions, and usages of tribes and castes.\n\n(2) Anthropometry, or physical measurements directed to the determination of types.\n\n(3) Photography of typical members of particular castes and tribes and if possible of archaic industries.\n\nNow as regards the first of these it is clear that nothing of the nature of a comprehensive ethnographic survey can be undertaken as part of the Census procedure. At the same time we may be sure that on this, as on previous occasions, the Census will be the means of bringing to light and placing on record much valuable knowledge which would otherwise have been lost. An instance of what I mean is to be found in Mr. A. W. Davis's admirable monograph on the Nagas printed as part of the Assam Census Report of 1891. I saw Mr. Davis recently in Assam, and I am glad to be able to announce that he has consented to rewrite his monograph, embodying in it a quantity of fresh material which he has since collected, and to publish it as a paper in the Journal of this Society. To those who, like myself, have long been watching with regretful eyes the passing away of primitive usage with the spread of Hinduism and Islam it is pleasant to hear that this process of disintegration has not as yet gone very far in Assam. Mr. Davis assures me that the characteristic tribes of that Province, and particularly the Nagas, have parted with none of their distinctive customs, except that of cutting off their neighbour's heads, which the most enthusiastic ethnologist will hardly regret. In head-taking as practised by the Nagas there seems to have been no vestige of even savage chivalry. One head was as good as another, and a Naga who had surprised and mutilated a helpless child or woman considered that he had earned as good a title to manhood as if he had killed a full-grown warrior in fair fight. The existence of the practice has no doubt helped to keep meddlesome strangers out of the hilly tracts, while of the Province generally it may be said that the absence of railways, the prevalence of the deadly form of malaria known as K\u0101la Az\u0101r, and the peculiar system of land tenures, under which there are no Rajas to create brahmottar and pirottar tenures for the benefit of their spiritual advisers, have combined to deter the Brahman and the Hadji\nfrom exploiting what is, when once you have got there, a fertile and attractive country. An instance or two of the customs which have thus been kept alive may be of interest. We find in the *khels* or tribal septs of the Nagas a complete example of the exogamous group of blood relations, dwelling apart in its own territory and more or less at war with the rest of the world, which Mr. McLennan and others believed to be the earliest organised unit of human society. Hitherto the only surviving specimen of the exogamous sept as reconstructed in Mr. McLennan's famous essay has been the *goch* of the Orissa Kandhs, which I came upon and described some years ago. But the Kandh *gochis* live at peace with one another, and to that extent have fallen away from their primitive condition; while the Naga *khel* fortifies its quarter of the villages with a stockade, a deep ditch full of bamboo caltrops, and a craftily devised ladder, and is for ever at war with its immediate neighbours. During the next few years I hope we may have more light thrown upon the internal structure of the Mongolian and semi-Mongolian tribes of our eastern borders, which has always been a bit of a puzzle. Meanwhile I venture the conjecture that further inquiry will show the *khel* or exogamous sept to be the original unit of their organisation, the tribal names by which we know them referring merely to locality or to some personal idiosyncracy, such as an aversion to wearing clothes, which may have struck their neighbours as distinctive.\n\nAnother subject of which I hope we may hear more is that of the picturesque oaths and ordeals in vogue among some of these people for the purpose of settling disputes. The Nagas for example have the most intense belief in the binding virtue of an oath when properly taken. The litigant who appeals in this fashion to the judgment of the powers unseen, bares his right arm and shoulder, plants one foot firmly in a noose of rope laid on the ground, and swears aloud in an elaborate formula, settled by much preliminary haggling with the other side, in which he devotes not himself only, but all the members of his *khel* or blood-kin to an early death if his cause is not good. Even if he is prepared to take risks himself, the *khel* see to it that their lives are not rashly sworn away. Still there are loop holes of which an adroit person may avail himself. If the opponents have weakly agreed to a loosely worded oath, or if in the most formidable oath the swearer can manage to skip or slur over an important word, he may win his case triumphantly without provoking divine intervention. Mr. Davis, who is well known as a leading authority on the Naga languages, told me that he had himself on several occasions detected a man in the act of slipping or mispronouncing a word. When called upon to repeat it he at once withdrew his foot from the noose, declined the ordeal and threw up his\ncase. Classical parallels will occur to everyone, and I am also reminded of a dramatic form of oath which was used in my own court when I was Subdivisional Officer of Govindpur in Manbhum. A piece of a tiger's skin was tied on to the railing of the witness box, and every Santal who gave evidence took the skin in his hand and swore in his own language a terrible oath which began by apostrophising the moon and ended with an invitation to the tiger to devour him if he swore falsely. I am not prepared to vouch for the efficacy of the sanction, but every now and then it was apparent that a witnesses was anxious to shirk holding the skin or tried to let go of it before the final adjuration kul jam\u00e1in \"May the tiger eat me\" had been reached.\n\nThe Kuki and Garo ordeals are of a different and more material type. Kuki disputants walk side by side into water holding their heads well back until the water reaches their mouths. The man who first chokes for breath loses his case. The Garos, so Captain Howell tells me, dive together into a deep pool, catch hold of a rock at the bottom and hold on as long as they can. Judgment is entered in favour of the man who comes up last; and cases are known of sturdy litigants getting themselves drowned in the process but winning the suit for their kith and kin beyond all possibility of appeal. The practice is a fairly ancient one, and is not confined to the Garos. Three hundred years ago, in 1586, Master Ralph Fitch, the first Englishman who visited Burma, found it prevailing among the people whom he calls Pegues:\n\n\"The Pegues if they have a sute in the law which is so doubtfull that they cannot well determine it, put two long canes into the water where it is very deepe: and both the parties go into the water by the poles, and there sit men to judge, and they both do dive under the water, and he which remaineth longest under the water doth winne the sute.\"\n\nTo return from this digression to the proposals of the British Association. The illustrations I have cited show that now and again an excellent monograph may be got from some one who has special knowledge of the usages of a particular tribe, while scraps of more or less interesting information may be picked up by anyone with a taste for such things. But we want more than this. Before all vestiges of primitive custom are swept away by the action of proselytism on the one side and education on the other sided, as I have elsewhere pointed out, by the recent extension of railways, we ought to have a systematic ethnographic survey of those parts of India which have not already been dealt with. The cost of such a survey would not be great; the\n\n1 Tribes and Castes of Bengal, Vol. i., p. xxix.\nlines on which it should proceed have already been laid down and have been tested by experience in two large Provinces; and in undertaking it the Government of India would merely be doing what the United States and the Government of Netherlands India have done long ago, and what I understand is now about to be done by our own Colonial Office for the large populations of savage races which the expansion of the Empire has recently brought under its control. Of the scientific arguments for undertaking such a survey it is needless to speak; but looking at the question from the point of view of practical administration I may be permitted to point out that the task of governing a great congeries of races, tribes and castes among whom diversity is the rule and uniformity the exception, and who at present show no sign of evolving a compact social type, demands above all things for its successful accomplishment some systematic acquaintance with the vast body of custom with which Government is brought into contact at an infinite number of points. Where knowledge means influence, knowledge is power. A learned Professor who came to India some fourteen years ago to study philosophy and published, besides an exhaustive treatise on his own subject, a delightful account of his personal experiences, tells in the latter volume a story which illustrates this principle. He says that just before the Census of 1881 there arose in certain Indian districts an extraordinary rumour that the people of certain tribes were to be branded and deported, the men to carry hospital litters in Afghanistan and the women to pluck tea in Assam. Not unnaturally the tribes in question, numbering several hundred thousand, stampeded en masse into the jungles and declined to be censused on any terms. It happened that two of the local officials, in places many hundred miles apart, were interested in tribal customs and had influence enough with the tribes to induce their headmen to come in and talk things over. In each case whisky loosened their tongues and in each case they were led to ask why they were being counted. To this question one official, who was of a prosaic turn of mind, replied by asking \"If you hide away and won't let me count you how am I to know how many of you will want rice in the next famine\"? The other, a Colonel in the Central Provinces, who added to a sense of humour some acquaintance with Indian folk-lore, gravely told them, as one would tell children a fairy-tale, how, so many months before, Her Majesty the Maharani and the Kaiser-i-R\u00fbs (the Emperor of Russia) had been dining together. \"Now when they had finished their curry and rice and were smoking their hookahs, they got quarrelling as to who had the most ryots. And he said he had, and she said she had, and they could not agree. So at last they made a very big bet (pan lag\u00e2y\u00e2), and ordered all their subjects to be counted. That\nis why I want to count you now, and if you don't come in and let me do it the Queen will lose her bet and your faces will be blackened forever.\" In either case the manoeuvre was successful; the tribesmen returned to their villages and the Census went off without a hitch. But the discussion which ended in this happy result would have been altogether impossible but for the friendly relations which had been already established on the common ground of ethnography.\n\nI have taken my illustration from Census but a dozen other branches of official business would have served my purpose equally well. Take famine for example. Different tribes and different castes feel the stress of scarcity in different ways; they require different treatment, and some of the most conspicuous failures of our famine administration in the past have been due to ignorance of the usages and traditions of the people with whom we had to deal.\n\nUnder the head of anthropometry the British Association wish that the opportunity of the Census may be taken \"to collect physical measurements, particularly of the Dravidian tribes, and of the Rajputs and Jats of Rajputana and the Eastern Panjab. Such data will be of the greatest service, in throwing light on the important and difficult problem of the origin of these tribes and their relation with the Yuechi and other Scythian races.\"\n\nAs I am responsible for having introduced anthropometry into India under the guidance of the late Sir William Flower and Professor Paul Topinard of Paris, I should like to say a few words about the history of the method of observation now known by that uncomfortable name. The idea of applying instruments of precision to the measurement of the human body was familiar to the Egyptians and the Greeks, both of whom appear to have made extensive experiments with the object of arriving at a 'canon' or ideal type showing the proportions which various parts of the body should bear to the entire figure and to each other. Such canons were usually expressed either in terms of a particular member of which the rest were supposed to be multiples, or in fractional parts of the entire stature. Thus the Egyptian canon, according to Lepsius, is based on the length of the middle finger and this measure is supposed to be contained nineteen times in the full stature, three times in the head and neck, eight times in the arm, and so forth. The Greek canon on the other hand, as restored by Quetelet, expresses the limbs and other dimensions in thousandth parts of the entire stature. Concerning this canon a curious story is told by Topinard, not without interest in its bearings upon the relations of Egyptian and Greek art. In 1866 the eminent French anthropologist, M. Paul Broca, was asked on behalf of M. Fock, who was engaged in\nthe attempt to reconstruct the Greek standard, to provide a skeleton corresponding in its proportions to certain measurements derived from an examination of the Belvedere Apollo. After some search Broca found in the Museum of the Anthropological Society at Paris a skeleton of the type required. It was that of a Soudanese negro named Abdullah, and from this Broca concluded that the famous statue of Apollo had been modelled on the Egyptian canou, which in his opinion had been derived by Egyptian sculptors from the study of the Nubian negroes whom they employed as models.\n\nThe Roman canon handed down in the treatise *De Architectura* of Vitruvius was taken up and developed in the early days of the Renaissance by Leo Battista Alberti, himself, like Vitruvius, an architect, and a curious enquirer into the secret ways of nature and the human frame. Forty years later Leonardo da Vinci, in his *Trattato della pittura*, expressed the general opinion that the proportions of the body should be studied in children and adults of both sexes, and refuted the opinion of Vitruvius that the navel should be deemed the centre of the body. Following Leonardo's suggestions, Albrecht D\u00fcrer addressed himself to the task of working out the proportions of the body for different ages and sexes, for persons of different heights, and different types of figure. In his 'Four books on the proportions of the human figure,' published at N\u00fcrnberg in 1528, the year of his death, D\u00fcrer also discussed the difficult question of the so-called 'orientation' or adjustment of the head in an upright position, and he is believed by the authors of the *Orania ethnica* to have also anticipated Camper's invention of the facial angle. Jean Cousin, a French contemporary of D\u00fcrer's, took the nose as his unit of length, and represented the ideal head as measuring four noses, and the ideal stature as equivalent to eight heads or thirty-two noses. Cousin's system, slightly modified by Charles Blanc, holds its own at the present day as the *canon des ateliers* of French artists, preference, however, being given in ordinary parlance to the head rather than the nose as the unit of length.\n\nAll these canons, it will be observed, approach the subject purely from the artistic point of view, and, so far from taking account of the distinctive characters of particular races, incline to sink these in the attempt to frame a general canon of the proportions of the body which should hold good for the whole of mankind. Such an endeavour would be foreign to the purpose of anthropology, which fixes its attention on points of difference rather than of resemblance, and seeks by examination and analysis of such differences to form hypotheses concerning the genesis of the distinct race stocks now in existence. It would perhaps be fanciful to trace the germs of anthropometric research in the state-\nment of Herodotus that the skulls of the Persian soldiers slain at the battle of Plat\u00e6a were thin, and those of the Egyptians were thick, or, to cite his explanation, that the former lived an indoor life and always wore hats, while the latter shaved their heads from infancy and exposed them to the sun without covering, as the earliest instance of the modern scientific doctrine of the influence of external conditions. But when Ctesias speaks of the small stature, black complexion, and snub noses of the inhabitants of India, we feel that the description is precise enough to enable us to identify them with the Dasyus and Nishadas of early Sanskrit literature, and we are almost tempted to wonder whether the Greek physician, who was doubtless acquainted with the canon of Polyoletus, may not have devised some accurate method of recording the racial characteristics of which he was so accurate an observer. Curiously enough the famous potter, Bernard de Palissy, was the first to throw out, in a humorous dialogue published in 1563, the idea of measuring the skull for purposes other than artistic. The passage quoted by Topinard is too quaint to be omitted here:\u2014\u201cQuoy voyant il me print envie de mesurer la teste d\u2019un homme pour s\u00e7avoir directement ses mesures, et me semble que la sauterelle, la r\u00e8gle et le compas me seroient fort propres pour cest affaire, mais quoy qu\u2019il en soit je n\u2019y scou jamais trouver une mesure osseuse, parce que les folies qui estoient en ladite teste luy faisaient changer ses mesures.\u201d\n\nPalissy however cannot be seriously put forward as the founder of scientific craniometry and that title perhaps most properly belongs to the Swedish naturalist Anders Retzius who in 1842, hit upon the device of expressing one of the chief characters of the skull by the relation of its maximum breadth to its maximum length, the latter being taken to be one thousand. In this way he distinguished two forms of skull\u2014the dolicho-cephalic, in which the length exceeds the breadth by about one-fourth, and the brachy-cephalic, in which the length exceeds the breadth by a proportion varying from one-fifth to one-eighth. Thus according to Retzius the Swedes are dolicho-cephalic in the proportion $773 : 1000$, and the Lapps brachy-cephalic in the proportion $865 : 1000$. He also distinguished two types of face\u2014the orthognathic, in which the jaws and teeth project not at all, or very little, beyond a line drawn from the forehead, and the prognathic, in which this projection is very marked. His classification of races was based upon these characteristics. In 1861 M. Paul Broca improved Retzius\u2019 system by expressing it in hundredths instead of thousandths, by introducing an intermediate group called mesati-cephalic, ranging from $77.7$ to $80$ per cent., and by giving the name of cephalic index to the relation between the two diameters. From time to time other characters have been added to the\nscheme such as the proportions of the nose, the dimensions of the face and forehead, the protuberance of the cheek bones, the facial angle, the stature in relation to the weight, the colour of the eyes and hair, and the transverse section of the hair as observed with a microscope. These later developments have the authority of Breca and Topinard in France, of Virchow in Germany, and of Sir William Flower, Dr. Beddoe, Dr. Garson and Mr. Francis Galton in England.\n\nThis is the method which the British Association desire to see extended in India. Let us first take stock of what has already been done. For Bengal the North-West Provinces and the Panjab we have a fairly complete series of measurements taken under my supervision in 1883-88, while for the N.-W.P. alone a second large series was taken by Captain Drake-Brockman some years later. Certain measurements were also taken by Mr. E. J. Kitts on a slightly different system. For Southern India there are Mr. Thurston's and Mr Holland's observations supplemented by a series of measurements taken for this Society under my directions by Babu Kumud Behari Samanta in 1892, and including the Cingalese, the so-called Moormen of Ceylon, and a number of Tamils from the East coast of Madras. Major Waddell's researches will I understand cover the whole of Assam, parts of Tibet and the region of the Eastern Himalaya and some of the Burmese races. For the extreme north-west of the Empire we have a small but very interesting set of measurements of Hunzas, Nagars and Kafirs which I had the good luck to get taken when Sir George Robertson brought these people to Calcutta some ten years ago. Savages as they were, their chiefs, who claimed to be descendants of Alexander, looked as if they had stepped down from a Greek vase of the best period and their measurements, especially that of the facial angle, seemed to confirm this impression.\n\nIn order to give full effect to the recommendations of the British Association we ought now to extend the measurements to the areas which have not yet been dealt with selecting in each case those castes and tribes typical of the area. We must at the same time endeavour to fill in any gaps that may be found in the existing series of measurements. There will, I believe, be no difficulty in settling for any given area what groups should be regarded as typical. For assistance in the work of measurement we may I trust look to the officers of the Indian Medical Service and the Royal Army Medical Corps who have always been ready to further the aims of scientific research in India.\n\nThe results of the large series of measurements taken in Northern India were set forth in a paper read at the meeting of the British Association at Newcastle in 1889 and published under the title 'The\nStudy of Ethnology in India' in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute, vol. xx, p. 235, in the following year. The conclusions then stated were accepted by Sir William Flower in his address as President of the British Association at Oxford; and were confirmed by the elaborate analyses of the figures subsequently published by Professor Topinard and Dr. Beddoe. They were, however, of a very general character and no attempt was made to press them into detail or to make them the basis of a minute classification of the various castes according to their supposed racial affinities. For this there were two reasons. In the first place some of the measurements, though introduced with the approval of Professors Flower and Topinard were admittedly experimental and it seemed desirable to await the judgment of experts before proceeding to generalise from the results; and secondly, it was doubtful whether a large series extending over a wider area might not introduce data pointing to quite different conclusions. A Provincial boundary is after all merely an arbitrary limit and it may well happen that the real clue to the origin of a tribe is only to be found by following it beyond the border of another Province. The great Kochh tribe is a case in point. Looking at them from the Bengal side one is inclined to say that on the whole Dravidian characteristics predominate over Mongolian, but in Assam the converse seems to hold good and it becomes obvious that a larger series and a wider view is necessary to settle the point. In connexion with this tribe my friend Major Prain has given me some interesting information which brings his researches in economic botany into relation with ethnology and supports the view that the Kochh are of Indo-Chinese rather than Dravidian origin. It seems that the northern districts of Bengal, Rungpur, Bogra, Dinajpur, Purnea,\u2014the country north of the great Ganges and east of the Kosi\u2014are marked by the cultivation of a considerable number of crops, particularly cold weather ones, which are peculiar to themselves or at any rate which do not extend farther south or further west into either the lower or the upper Gangetic plain.\n\nThe commonest field Sag in the whole of this area is what the people term Lapha, which is a Mallow (Malva verticillata). This is hardly met with anywhere else in India. A very common garden Sag is the Lah Sag, a cabbage mustard (Brassica amotfolia) also grown largely in the Assam valley but not elsewhere grown in India.\n\nA widely cultivated oil-seed is a Chrysanthemum, (C. coronarium) commonly cultivated in Assam and in Burma but hardly if at all cultivated elsewhere in India.\n\nThe plant which the people grow for its fibre and use almost exclusively for making fishing nets and ropes for dragging their boats\nis what they term Kankhara which is the plant we know as Riha Boehmeria nivea\u2014the China grass or Ramie). This is also grown in the whole of the Assam valley for the same purposes but is never grown by the native inhabitants, in any other part of India. The Boehmeria and the Chrysanthemum are certainly, the Brassica is almost certainly of Chinese origin, while the employment of this Mallow as a vegetable is a Chinese usage. This incursion of botany into the domain of ethnology is, so far as I know, an entirely new departure and we may hope that Major Prain will find leisure to develope it.\n\nOne curious misapprehension I may take this opportunity of clearing up. In a sketch of the caste system which appeared in the Revue des Deux Mondes in 1894, and has since been published as a separate volume, M. Senart did me the honour of noticing at length some speculations of mine as to the origin of caste. In discussing the nasal index, the percentage of the breadth of the nose on its length, which Professors Flower and Topinard agree in regarding as the best test of race distinctions, I had pointed out that in certain parts of India, if a series of castes were arranged according to their nasal index, that order would be found to correspond substantially with the accepted order of social precedence. I went on to say \"it is scarcely a paradox to lay down as a law of the caste organisation in Eastern India that a man's social status varies in inverse ratio to the width of his nose.\" On this M. Senart remarks\u2014\"M. Risley aboutit \u00e0 cette affirmation singuli\u00e8re, au moins d' aspect : 'C'est \u00e0 peine une exag\u00e9ration d'\u00e9tablir comme une loi de l'organisation des castes dans l'Inde Orientale, que le rang social d'un homme varie en raison inverse de la largeur de son nez.' Qui ne resterait un peu sceptique\"? Who indeed, if I had really made the affirmation singuli\u00e8re which M. Senart imputes to me? What I did say was something quite different. M. Senart's criticism in fact rests on a mistranslation. L'Inde Orientale means the whole of India\u2014the East Indies as one might say; \"Eastern India\" means the eastern part of India to which, as appears clearly enough from the context, my remarks were limited. The expression is used in much the same sense by Mr. Montgomery Martin as the title of the well-known work\u2014a sort of county history of part of Bengal\u2014which he compiled in 1838 from the manuscript records of Dr. Francis Buchanan's survey, and by Sir Joseph Hooker in his introduction to the Flora Indica.\n\nThe British Association suggest in particular that anthropometric observations will throw light on the important and difficult problem of the origin of the Rajputs and Jats of Rajputana the Eastern Panjab and their relation with the Yuchi and other Scythian races. Now\nwho were the Yu-echi and why should they be supposed to be connected with the Jats and Rajputs? To answer the question fully would require a volume but some brief answer is necessary to explain the proposals of the Association. According to Chinese authorities quoted by De Guignes, shortly after the building of the Great Wall of China a people called Yue-chi were expelled about 200 B.C. by the Hiungnu or Huns from their original settlements on the East of Lake Lob and driven westward. On their march they separated into two bands, the smaller of which made its way into Tibet, while the larger body took possession of the country between the Jaxartes and Oxus, where they are shown by Klaproth as settled in 31 B.C. Klaproth says they were of the same race as the Khiang, whom he describes as the aborigines of China. From Transoxiana the Yu-echi are said to have spread to Khwarism and Bokhara, and thence to the country on the Indus, where Tamerlane on his arrival in 1398 \"recognised his old antagonists in their distant colony.\" Here they were in power for several centuries, and were known to the classical geographers as Get\u00e6. Mr. Keane supposes that the Yu-echi were a people of Turki stock who entered India as conquerors, bringing with them a number of Bactrian peasants from the Kabul Valley. The Yu-echi, he thinks, are now represented by the Rajputs, while their followers were the ancestors of the Jats. The historical evidence does not seem very tangible, but if it is true that the Yu-echi were identical with the Khiang, and that their features were distinctive enough for Tamerlane, himself a Tartar, to recognise them, they probably were of Mongolian stock, and might, even now, retain some trace of Mongolian characteristics. If so, the method of measurement first used by Mr. Oldfield Thomas on a collection of Torres Straits skulls and introduced into India by me, with Sir William Flower's approval, for the purpose of dealing with the Mongoloid tribes of the Eastern Himalayas, may be trusted to bring out any trace of Mongolian blood that survives among the Jats. If no such trace is found, we may perhaps conclude that the theory of their Scythian origin rests on one of those verbal mystifications which have played so large a part in ethnology.\n\nLastly the Association ask for a series of photographs of typical individuals of the various races, and, if it should be practicable, of views of archaic industries, etc. This sounds at first sight a very extensive project, and so it would be if carried out de novo in the manner\n\n---\n\n1 Histoire des Huns, ii., 42.\n2 Klaproth, Tableaux Historiques de l'Asie, p. 13.\n3 De Guignes Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions, vol. xxv., p. 32.\n4 Man Past and Present, p. 323.\nsuggested by the Association \"by placing photographers at the service to the Census officers.\" But an enormous number of admirable photographs of the various races of India are already in existence, and if we did nothing more than select from among these typical pictures of the characteristic people of each Province, and reproduce them by one of the cheap modern processes we should preserve and place on record a mass of very valuable material. The end in view would be to produce a revised and expanded edition of a book famous in its day, Watson and Kaye's People of India, the pictures in which have now faded almost out of recognition. To supplement the report on the Census of each Province and State by a volume of permanent prints illustrating the people and their pursuits, would be a worthy memorial of the Census of 1901. And it is an object in which I believe we could count on the enthusiastic co-operation of both professional and amateur photographers throughout India. The ideal to be worked up to would be the splendid series of types of the Indian army taken at Captain Bingley's instance to illustrate the Caste Handbooks which I have already mentioned.\n\nIn conclusion I wish to say a few words about the striking explanation of the origin of Totemism which has been put forward by Mr. J. G. Frazer in some recent numbers of the Fortnightly Review. The subject is one of special interest to us in India because the Indian evidence on the subject seems not only to point to conclusions different from those arrived at by Mr. Frazer on the basis of the Australian data recently published by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen, but to suggest a new canon for determining the historical value of ethnographic evidence in general.\n\n\"A totem\" says Mr. Frazer \"is a class of natural phenomena or material objects\u2014most commonly a species of animals or plants\u2014between which and himself the savage believes that a certain intimate relation exists. The exact nature of the relation is not easy to ascertain; various explanations of it have been suggested, but none has as yet won general acceptance. Whatever it may be, it generally leads the savage to abstain from killing or eating his totem, if his totem happens to be a species of animals or plants. Further, the group of persons who are knit to any particular totem by this mysterious tie commonly bear the name of the totem, believe themselves to be of one blood, and strictly refuse to sanction the marriage or cohabitation of members of\n\n---\n\n1 The Native Tribes of Central Australia. By Baldwin Spencer, M.A., sometime Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford, Professor of Biology in the University of Melbourne; and J. F. Gillen, special Magistrate and Sub-Protector of the Aborigines, Alice Springs, South Australia.\nthe group with each other. This prohibition to marry within the group is now generally called by the name of Exogamy. Thus, Totemism has commonly been treated as a primitive system both of religion and of society. As a system of religion it embraces the mystic union of the savage with his totem; as a system of society it comprises the relations in which men and women of the same totem stand to each other and to the members of other totemic groups. And corresponding to these two sides of the system are two rough-and-ready tests or canons of Totemism: first, the rule that a man may not kill or eat his totem animal or plant; and second, the rule that he may not marry or cohabit with a woman of the same totem. Whether the two sides\u2014the religious and the social\u2014have always co-existed or are essentially independent, is a question which has been variously answered. Some writers\u2014for example, Sir John Lubbock and Mr. Herbert Spencer\u2014have held that Totemism began as a system of society only, and that the superstitious regard for the totem developed later, through a simple process of misunderstanding. Others, including J. F. McLennan and Robertson Smith, were of opinion that the religious reverence for the totem is original, and must, at least, have preceded the introduction of Exogamy.\"\n\nThe system of totems prevailing in Central Australia is so far parallel to that known in India that it includes not only animals and plants but also a number of objects animate and inanimate. Thus while the Australians have \"totems of the wind, the sun, the evening star, fire, water, cloud and so on\" we find among our Dravidians in India the month of June, Wednesday in every week, the moon, the rainbow, the constellation Pleiades figuring as totems among a number of names which include pretty well the entire flora and fauna of the country where the tribe is settled. But while among the Australians the religious aspect of the totem is relatively more prominent than the social, in India the position is reversed; the social side of the system is very much alive while the religious side has fallen into disuse. It is the religious side on which Mr. Frazer lays stress, and he explains totemism as \"primarily an organised and cooperative system of magic designed to secure for the members of the community, on the one hand, a plentiful supply of all the commodities of which they stand in need, and, on the other hand, immunity from all the perils and dangers to which man is exposed in his struggle with nature.\" In other words totemism is a primitive Commissariat and General Providence Department which at a later stage took over the business of regulating marriage. The evidence for this proposition is derived from the magical ceremonies called Intichiuma in which the members\nof each totem solemnly mimic the animals and plants after which they are called, and eat a small portion of them with the object of ensuring a plentiful supply of the animals and plants of that species. Thus the men of the totem called after the Witchetty grub, a succulent caterpillar of some kind which is esteemed a great luxury, paint their bodies in imitation of the grub, crawl through a structure of boughs supposed to represent its chrysalis, chant a song inviting the insect to go and lay eggs, and butt each other in the stomach with the remark \"You have eaten much food.\" The Emu men dress themselves up to resemble Emus and imitate the movements and aimless gazing about of the birds; the Kangaroo men and the men of the Hakea Flower totem go through similar mummeries.\n\nNow in the first place the doubt occurs to one whether small and moribund tribes, such as the Australians, can fairly be taken to be typical of primitive man. If they could, then man would be primitive still, and we should none of us have got to the point of vexing our souls about the origin of anything. The one distinctive feature of the Australian natives is their incapacity for any sort of progressive evolution. Surely an atrophied or it may be degenerate man of that type is not the sort of ancestor we want to discover; for it is difficult to see what we can learn from him. In Europe on the other hand primitive man, so far as we can judge from the traces he has left behind seems to have been an animal of an entirely different type. He had indeed his weaknesses\u2014does not his vates sacer, Mr. Andrew Lang, impute to him a diet of oysters and foes\u2014but he fought a good fight with his environment and as events show he came out a winner. It seems then that the quest of primitive man ready made and only waiting to be observed and analysed may be nothing better than a tempting short cut, leading to delusion, and that what we must look to is not so much primitive man but primitive usage regarded in its bearing on evolution.\n\nIt is from this point of view that I wish to put in a plea for the consideration of the Indian data. Primitive usages may, I would suggest, be divided, as Mr. Bagehot divided political institutions, into the effective and the ineffective, in other words, into those which affect evolution and those which do not. In the case of totemism you can distinguish these two pretty clearly. The magical ritual of the Arunta tribe obviously belongs to the ineffective class. No one outside the Arunta\u2014and even among them one would think there must be augurs\u2014\n\n1 Spencer and Gillon, p. 9. See also p. 114, where it is stated that the word \"corroboree\" for a tribal dance or orgy is borrowed from the whites. Can anyone imagine a compact tribe, like the Santals, borrowing a foreign term for a tribal custom?\nsupposes that by performing the most elaborate parody of the demeanour of certain animals a man can really cause them to increase and multiply. In India, on the other hand, our totemistic people have got rid of all such antics, if indeed they ever practised them, and retain only the unquestionably effective factor in the system, the rule that a man may not marry a woman of his own totem. They have, it is true, also the rule that people may not eat, injure or make use of their totems, but this prohibition is relatively weak, and in some cases the totems are articles such as rice and salt which the members of the totem-kin could hardly do without.\n\nGiven then a state of things such as this, that tribes which are in no way moribund or degenerate, but on the contrary extremely full of life, retain the effective part of an archaic usage along with traces of its ineffective parts, may we not reasonably conclude that this effective part, which has stood the wear and tear of ages and contributed to the evolution of the tribe, furnishes the clue to the real origin of the usage itself? Assume this to be so and totemism at once wheels into line and takes the place, which it appears clearly to occupy in India, of a form of exogamy. The particular form presents no great difficulty. Primitive men are like children: they are constantly saying to themselves \"Let's pretend,\" and a favourite and widespread form of the game is to pretend to be animals. Only they play it in earnest, and very grim earnest it sometimes is, as one discovers when one has to administer a district where people believe that men can transform themselves into animals at will, or can be so transformed by the agency of witchcraft.\n\nIt will be asked, what then is the origin of exogamy? Here again I think the Indian evidence suggests an answer. Just as the special phenomenon of totemism may be explained by reference to the general law of exogamy, so exogamy itself may be traced to the still more general law of natural selection. Nor need we strain the law. We know that there is a tendency in individuals or groups of individuals to vary their habits; and that useful variations tend to be preserved and ultimately transmitted. Now suppose that in a primitive community, such as the Naga Khel or the Kandh Gochi, the men happened to vary in the direction of taking their wives from some other community, and that this infusion of fresh blood proved advantageous to the group. The original instinct would then be stimulated by heredity, and the element of sexual selection would in course of time come into play. For an exogamous groups would have a larger choice of women than an endogamous one, and would thus get finer women, who again, in the course of the primitive struggle for wives, would be appropriated by the\nstrongest and most warlike men. Exogamous groups thus strengthened would tend, as time went on, to 'eat up,' as the Zulus used to say, their endogamous neighbours or at any rate to deprive them of the pick of their marriageable girls; and the custom of exogamy would spread, partly by imitation, and partly by the extinction of the groups which did not practise it.\n\nThe fact that we cannot say how people came to vary in this particular fashion is not necessarily fatal to the hypothesis put forward. In the case of animals other than man, we do not call in question the doctrine of natural selection because we cannot divine the precise cause which gave rise to some beneficial variation. It is enough that variations do occur, and that the beneficial ones tend to be transmitted. If however an attempt must be made to pierce the veil which shuts off from our view the ages of pre-historic evolution, it does not seem unreasonable to suppose that here and there some half-accidental circumstance, such as the transmission of a physical defect or an hereditary disease, may have given primitive man a sort of warning and thus have induced the particular kind of variation which his circumstances required. Conquest again may have produced the same effect by bringing about a beneficial mixture of stocks, though it is a little difficult to see, as Mr. Lang pointed out long ago, why the possession of foreign women should have disinclined people to marry the women of their own group. At the same time it is conceivable that the impulse may have been set going by some tribe from which all its marriageable women had been raided, and which was thus driven by necessity to start raiding on its own account. I have elsewhere given instances, drawn from the Kandhs and Nagas, which lend themselves to this view; but I am not sure that we need travel beyond the tendency to accidental variation which appears in all living organisms and may be assumed to have shaped the evolution of primitive man.\n\nI may now draw together the loose ends of thoughts which the proposal of the British Association have suggested. Speaking as President of this Society, and leaving out of consideration for the moment those questions of ways and means which have to be taken into account when one quits the domain of the ideal, I would formulate the requirements of ethnological research in India at the present time as follows:\n\nFirst, we want the ethnographic survey, which has been carried out in Bengal and the N.-W.P., to be extended on similar lines to the rest of India. This ought be done within a reasonable time and cannot be postponed indefinitely.\n\nSecondly, we want a record of the physical characters of typical\ntribes and castes for those parts of India which are not covered by existing investigations.\n\nThirdly, we want a series of permanent photographs of the typical tribes and castes of each Province and Native State.\n\nFourthly, we want those who are engaged on similar inquiries in Europe to recognise that India is full of survivals, which are none the less instructive because the people among whom they occur are in no sense moribund and are ready enough to avail themselves of the material advantages which an alien civilization places within their reach. It was with this object that I referred just now to the bearing of Indian Ethnographic data on the question of the origin of totemism and exogamy, and that I drew attention in last year's address to some parallels between the domestic life of the Greeks and Romans and that of the people of India at the present day. It may be that I exaggerate the importance of things Indian\u2014if so I am content to err in such good company as Sir Henry Maine, Herr Bachofen, and M. Fustel de Coulanges\u2014but in any case the matter seems to deserve serious examination and cannot be brushed aside lightly with the remark that there is nothing primitive in India.\n\nAll members of the Society will hear with regret that his Grace Archbishop Goethals, who till lately was one of our Vice-Presidents, is about to leave India. The Archbishop's superb library, and his wide knowledge of all branches of literature bearing on India and the East, have always been at the disposal of students, and I am proud of being one of the many who have profited by his advice and guidance in matters of research.\n\nThere is no need for me to ask you to join with me in welcoming Sir John Woodburn as the next President. His sympathy with the ways of thought of the natives of this country, his knowledge of their traditions and usages and his familiarity with their village life\u2014the real life of the people of India\u2014furnish the best guarantee that under his auspices the lines of inquiry on which we are now proceeding will be developed and extended.\n\nI will now ask His Excellency the Patron to address the Society on Ancient Buildings in India. Those of us who are acquainted with Lord Curzon's interesting study of the architecture of Kedleston House, the prototype of Government House, Calcutta, will know that His Excellency has made this fascinating subject peculiarly his own.\nHis Excellency Baron Curzon of Kedleston, Patron of the Society, spoke on the subject of\n\nANCIENT MONUMENTS IN INDIA.\n\nI hope that there is nothing inappropriate in my addressing to this Society a few observations upon the duty of Government in respect of ancient buildings in India. The Asiatic Society of Bengal still, I trust, even in these days when men are said to find no time for scholarship, and when independent study or research seems to have faded out of Indian fashion, retains that interest in archaeology which is so often testified to in its earlier publications, and was promoted by so many of its most illustrious names. Surely here, if anywhere, in this house which enshrines the memorials, and has frequently listened to the wisdom of great scholars and renowned students, it is permissible to recall the recollection of the present generation to a subject that so deeply engaged the attention of your early pioneers, and that must still, even in a breathless age, appeal to the interest of every thoughtful man.\n\nIn the course of my recent tour, during which I visited some of the most famous sites and beautiful or historic buildings in India, I more than once remarked, in reply to Municipal addresses, that I regarded the conservation of ancient monuments as one of the primary obligations of Government. We have a duty to our fore-runners, as well as to our contemporaries and to our descendants,\u2014nay our duty to the two latter classes in itself demands the recognition of an obligation to the former, since we are the custodians for our own age of that which has been bequeathed to us by an earlier, and since posterity will rightly blame us if, owing to our neglect, they fail to reap the same advantages that we have been privileged to enjoy. Moreover, how can we expect at the hands of futurity any consideration for the productions of our own time\u2014if indeed any are worthy of such\u2014unless we have ourselves shown a like respect to the handiwork of our predecessors? This obligation, which I assert and accept on behalf of Government, is one of an even more binding character in India than in many European countries. There abundant private wealth is available for the acquisition or the conservation of that which is frequently private property. Corporations, societies, endowments, trusts provide a vast machinery that relieves the Government of a large portion of its obligation. The historic buildings, the magnificent temples, the inestimable works of art, are invested with a publicity that to some extent saves them from the risk of desecration or the encroachments of decay. Here all is different. India is covered with the visible records of vanished dynasties, of forgotten monarchs, of persecuted and sometimes dishonoured creeds.\nThese monuments are, for the most part, though there are notable exceptions, in British territory, and on soil belonging to Government. Many of them are in out of the way places, and are liable to the combined ravages of a tropical climate, an exuberant flora, and very often a local and ignorant population, who see only in an ancient building the means of inexpensively raising a modern one for their own convenience. All these circumstances explain the peculiar responsibility that rests upon Government in India. If there be any one who says to me that there is no duty devolving upon a Christian Government to preserve the monuments of a pagan art, or the sanctuaries of an alien faith, I cannot pause to argue with such a man. Art, and beauty, and the reverence that is owing to all that has evoked human genius, or has inspired human faith, are independent of creeds, and, in so far as they touch the sphere of religion, are embraced by the common religion of all mankind. Viewed from this standpoint, the rock temple of the Brahmans stands on precisely the same footing as the Buddhist Vihara, and the Mahomedan Musjid as the Christian Cathedral. There is no principle of artistic discrimination between the mausoleum of the despot and the sepulchre of the saint. What is beautiful, what is historic, what tears the mask off the face of the past, and helps us to read its riddles, and to look it in the eyes\u2014these, and not the dogmas of a combative theology, are the principal criteria to which we must look. Much of ancient history, even in an age of great discoveries, still remains mere guess work. It is only slowly being pieced together by the efforts of scholars and by the outcome of research. But the clues are lying everywhere at our hand, in buried cities, in undeciphered inscriptions, in casual coins, in crumbling pillars, and pencilled slabs of stone. They supply the data by which we may reconstruct the annals of the past, and recall to life the morality, the literature, the politics, the art of a perished age.\n\nCompared with the antiquity of Assyrian or Egyptian, or even of early European monuments, the age of the majority of Indian monuments is not great. I speak subject to correction, but my impression is that the oldest sculptured monument in India is the Sanchi Tope, the great railing of which cannot possibly be placed before the middle of the 3rd century before Christ, although the tope itself may be earlier. At that time the palaces of Chald\u00e6a and Nineveh, the Pyramids and the rock tombs of Egypt, were already thousands of years old. We have no building in India as old as the Parthenon at Athens; the large majority are young compared with the Coliseum at Rome. All the Norman and the majority of the Gothic Cathedrals of England and of Western Europe were already erected before the great era of Moslem architecture in India had begun. The Kutub Minar at Delhi, which is the finest\nearly Mahomedan structure in this country, was built within a century of Westminster Hall in London, which we are far from regarding as an ancient monument. As for the later glories of Arabian architecture at Delhi, at Agra, and at Lahore, the Colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, which we regard in England as the last product of a dying architectural epoch, were already grey when they sprang, white and spotless, from the hands of the masons of Akbar and Shah Jehau; while the Taj Mahal was only one generation older than Wren's Renaissance fabric of modern St. Paul's.\n\nThere is another remarkable feature of the majority of Indian antiquities\u2014of those at any rate that belong to the Musalman epoch\u2014that they do not represent an indigenous genius or an Indian style. They are exotics, imported into this country in the train of conquerors, who had learnt their architectural lessons in Persia, in Central Asia, in Arabia, in Afghanistan. More than a thousand years earlier a foreign influence had exercised a scarcely less marked, though more transient, influence upon certain forms of Indian architecture. I allude to the Greek types which were derived from the Greco-Bactrian kingdoms, that were founded upon the remains of Alexander's conquests, and which in the centuries immediately preceding the Christian era profoundly affected the art and sculpture of North-West India, and the Punjab. Indian sculptures or Indian buildings, however, because they reflect a foreign influence, or betray a foreign origin, are not the less, but perhaps the more interesting to ourselves, who were borne to India upon the crest of a later but similar wave, and who may find in their non-Indian characteristics a reminiscence of forms which we already know in Europe, and of a process of assimilation with which our own archeological history has rendered us familiar. Indeed a race like our own, who are themselves foreigners, are in a sense better fitted to guard, with a dispassionate and impartial zeal, the relics of different ages, and of sometimes antagonistic beliefs, than might be the descendants of the warring races or the votaries of the rival creeds. To us the relics of Hindu, and Mahomedan, of Buddhist, Brahmin, and Jain are, from the antiquarian, the historical, and the artistic point of view, equally interesting and equally sacred. One does not excite a more vivid, and the other a weaker emotion. Each represents the glories or the faith of a branch of the human family. Each fills a chapter in Indian history. Each is a part of the heritage which Providence has committed to the custody of the ruling power.\n\nIf, however, the majority of the structural monuments of India, the topes, and temples, the palaces, and fortresses, and tombs be of no exceeding antiquity in the chronology of architecture, and even if the\ngreater number of those at any rate which are well known and visited, are not indigenous in origin, it remains true, on the other hand, that it is in the exploration and study of purely Indian remains, in the probing of archaic mounds, in the excavation of old Indian cities, and in the copying and reading of ancient inscriptions, that a good deal of the exploratory work of the archaeologist in India will in future lie. The later pages of Indian history are known to us, and can be read by all. But a curtain of dark and romantic mystery hangs over the earlier chapters, of which we are only slowly beginning to lift the corners. This also is not less an obligation of Government. Epigraphy should not be set behind research any more than research should be set behind conservation. All are ordered parts of any scientific scheme of antiquarian work. I am not one of those who think that Government can afford to patronise the one and ignore the other. It is, in my judgment, equally our duty to dig and discover, to classify, reproduce, and describe, to copy and decipher, and to cherish and conserve. Of restoration I cannot, on the present occasion, undertake to speak, since the principles of legitimate and artistic restoration require a more detailed analysis than I have time to bestow upon them this evening. But it will be seen from what I have said that my view of the obligations of Government is not grudging, and that my estimate of the work to be done is ample.\n\nIf then the question be asked how has the British Government hitherto discharged, and how is it now discharging its task, what is the answer that must be returned? I may say in preface that were the answer unfavourable\u2014and I will presently examine that point\u2014we should merely be forging a fresh link in an unbroken historic chain. Every or nearly every successive religion that has permeated or overawed this country has vindicated its own fervour at the expense of the rival whom it had dethroned. When the Brahmans went to Ellora, they hacked away the features of all the seated Buddhas in the rock-chapels and halls. When Kutub-ud-din commenced, and Altamsh continued, the majestic mosque that flanks the Kutub Minar, it was with the spoil of Hindu temples that they reared the fabric, carefully defacing or besmearing the sculptured Jain images, as they consecrated them to their novel purpose. What part of India did not bear witness to the ruthless vandalism of the great iconoclast Aurungzeb? When we admire his great mosque with its tapering minarets, which are the chief feature of the river front at Benares, how many of us remember that he tore down the holy Hindu temple of Vishveshwar to furnish the material and to supply the site? Nadir Shah during his short Indian inroad effected a greater spoliation that has probably ever been\nachieved in so brief a space of time. When the Maratha conquerors overran Northern India, they pitilessly mutilated and wantonly destroyed. When Ranjit Singh built the Golden Temple at Umritsar, he ostentatiously rifled Mahomedan buildings and mosques. Nay, dynasties did not spare their own members, nor religions their own shrines. If a capital or fort or sanctuary was not completed in the life-time of the builder, there was small chance of its being finished, there was a very fair chance of its being despoiled, by his successor and heir. The environs of Delhi are a wilderness of deserted cities and devastated tombs. Each fresh conqueror, Hindu or Moghul or Pathan, marched, so to speak, to his own immortality over his predecessor's grave. The great Akbar in a more peaceful age first removed the seat of Government from Delhi to Agra, and then built Fatehpur Sikri as a new capital, only to be abandoned by his successor. Jehangir alternated between Delhi and Agra, but preferred Lahore to either. Shah Jehan beautified Agra, and then contemplated a final return to Delhi. Aurengzeb marched away to the south, and founded still another capital, and was himself buried in territories that now belong to Hyderabad. These successive changes, while they may have reflected little more than a despot's caprice, were yet inimical both to the completion and to the continuous existence of architectural fabrics. The British Government are fortunately exempt from any such promptings, either of religious fanaticism, of restless vanity, or of dynastic and personal pride. But in proportion as they have been unassailed by such temptations, so is their responsibility the greater for inaugurating a new era and for displaying that tolerant and enlightened respect to the treasures of all, which is one of the main lessons that the returning West has been able to teach to the East.\n\nIn the domain of archaeology as elsewhere, the original example of duty has been set to the Government of India by individual effort and by private enthusiasm; and only by slow degrees has Government, which is at all times and seasons a tardy learner, warmed to its task. The early archaeological researches, conducted by the founders and pioneers of this Society, by Jones, Colebrooke, Wilson, and Prinsep, and by many another clarum et venerabile nomen, were in the main literary in character. They consisted in the reconstruction of alphabets, the translation of manuscripts, and the decipherment of inscriptions. Sanscrit scholarship was the academic cult of the hour. How these men laboured is illustrated by the fact that Prinsep and Kittoe both died of overwork at the age of 40. Then followed an era of research in buildings and monuments; the pen was supplemented by the spade; and, in succession, descriptions, drawings, paintings, engravings, and in later days\nphotographs and casts gradually revealed to European eyes the precious contents of the unvisited quarries of Hindustan. In this generation of explorers and writers, special honour must be paid to two names, to James Fergusson, whose earliest work was published in 1845, and who was the first to place the examination of Indian architecture upon a scholarly basis, and to General Sir A. Cunningham, who only a few years later was engaged in the first scientific excavation of the Bhilsa topes. These and other toilers in the same field laboured with a diligence beyond praise; but the work was too great for individual exertion, and much of it remained desultory, fragmentary, and incomplete.\n\nMeanwhile the Government of India was concerned with laying the foundations and extending the borders of a new Empire, and thought little of the relics of old ones. From time to time a Governor-General, in an access of exceptional enlightenment or generosity, spared a little money for the fitful repair of ancient monuments. Lord Minto appointed a Committee to conduct repairs at the Taj. Lord Hastings ordered works at Fatehpur Sikri and Sikandra. Lord Amherst attempted some restoration of the Kutub Minar. Lord Hardinge persuaded the Court of Directors to sanction arrangements for the examination, delineation, and record of some of the chief Indian antiquities. But these spasmodic efforts resulted in little more than the collection of a few drawings, and the execution of a few local and perfunctory repairs. How little the leaven had permeated the lump, and how strongly the barbarian still dominated the aesthetic in the official mind, may be shown by incidents that from time to time occurred.\n\nIn the days of Lord William Bentinck the Taj was on the point of being destroyed for the value of its marbles. The same Governor-General sold by auction the marble bath in Shah Jehan's Palace at Agra, which had been torn up by Lord Hastings for a gift to George IV., but had somehow never been despatched. In the same r\u00e9gime a proposal was made to lease the gardens at Sikandra to the Executive Engineer at Agra for the purposes of speculative cultivation. In 1857, after the Mutiny, it was solemnly proposed to raze to the ground the Jumma Masjid at Delhi, the noblest ceremonial mosque in the world, and it was only spared at the instance of Sir John Lawrence. As late as 1868 the destruction of the great gateways of the Sanchi Tope was successfully prevented by the same statesman. I have read of a great Mahomedan pillar, over 600 years old, which was demolished at Aligarh, to make room for certain municipal improvements and for the erection of some bunias' shops, which, when built, were never let. Some of the sculptured columns of the exquisite Hindu-Mussulman mosque at Ajmere were pulled down by a zealous officer to construct a triumphal\narch under which the Viceroy of the day was to pass. James Ferguson's books sound one unending note of passionate protest against the barrack-builder, and the military engineer. I must confess that I think these individuals have been, and within the more restricted scope now left to them, still are inveterate sinners. Climb the hill top at Gwalior and see the barracks of the British soldiers, and the relics, not yet entirely obliterated, of his occupation of the Palace in the Fort. Read in the Delhi guide-books of the horrors that have been perpetrated in the interests of regimental barracks and messes and canteens in the fairy-like pavilions and courts and gardens of Shah Jehan. It is not yet 30 years since the Government of India were invited by a number of army doctors to cut off the battlements of the Fort at Delhi, in order to improve the health of the troops, and only desisted from doing so when a rival band of medical doctrinaires appeared upon the scene to urge the retention of the very same battlements, in order to prevent malarial fever from creeping in. At an earlier date when picnic-parties were held in the garden of the Taj, it was not an uncommon thing for the revellers to arm themselves with hammer and chisel, with which they wiled away the afternoon by chipping out fragments of agate and carnelian from the cenotaphs of the Emperor and his lamented Queen. Indeed when I was at Agra the other day, I found that the marble tomb of Shah Jehan in the lower vault, beneath which his body actually lies, was still destitute of much of its original inlay, of which I ordered the restoration.\n\nThat the era of vandalism is not yet completely at an end is evident from recent experiences, among which I may include my own. When Fergusson wrote his book, the Diwan-i-Am, or Public Hall of Audience, in the Palace at Delhi was a military arsenal, the outer colonnades of which had been built up with brick arches lightened by English windows. All this was afterwards removed. But when the Prince of Wales came to India in 1876, and held a Durbar in this building, the opportunity was too good to be lost; and a fresh coat of whitewash was plentifully bespattered over the red sandstone pillars and plinths of the Durbar-hall of Aurungzeb. This too I hope to get removed. When His Royal Highness was at Agra, and the various pavilions of Shah Jehan's palace were connected together for the purposes of an evening party and ball, local talent was called in to reproduce the faded paintings on marble and plaster of the Moghul artists two and a half centuries before. The result of their labours is still an eyesore and a regret. When I was at Lahore in April last, I found the exquisite little Moti Masjid, or Pearl Mosque, in the Fort, which was erected by Jehangir exactly three hundred years ago, still used for the profane\npurpose to which it had been converted by Ranjit Singh, viz., as a Government Treasury. The arches were built up with brick-work, and below the marble floor had been excavated as a cellar for the reception of iron-bound chests of rupees. I pleaded for the restoration to its original state of this beautiful little building, which I suppose not one visitor in a hundred to Lahore has ever seen. Ranjit Singh cared nothing for the taste or the trophies of his Mahomedan predecessors, and half a century of British military occupation, with its universal paintpot, and the exigencies of the Public Works Engineer, has assisted the melancholy decline. Fortunately in recent years something has been done to rescue the main buildings of the Moghul Palace from these two insatiable enemies. At Ahmedabad I found the mosque of Sidi Sayid, the pierced stone lattice-work of whose demi-lune windows is one of the glories of India, used as a teahalder's kutcherry, and disfigured with plaster partitions, and the omnivorous whitewash. I hope to effect the reconversion of this building. After the conquest of Upper Burma in 1885, the Palace of the Kings at Mandalay which, although built for the most part of wood, is yet a noble specimen of Burmese art, was converted by our conquering battalions into a Club House, a Government Office, and a Church. By degrees I am engaged in removing these superfluous denizens, with the idea of preserving the building as the monument, not of a dynasty that has vanished never to return, but of an art that, subject to the vicissitudes of fire, earthquake, and decay, is capable of being a joy for ever. There are other sites and fabrics in India upon which I also have my eye, which I shall visit, if possible, during my time, and which I shall hope to rescue from a kindred or a worse fate.\n\nThese are the gloomy or regrettable features of the picture. On the other hand, there has been, during the last 40 years, some sort of sustained effort on the part of Government to recognize its responsibilities and to purge itself of a well-merited reproach. This attempt has been accompanied, and sometimes delayed, by disputes as to the rival claims of research and of conservation, and by discussion over the legitimate spheres of action of the Central and the Local Governments. There have been periods of supineness as well as of activity. There have been moments when it has been argued that the State had exhausted its duty or that it possessed no duty at all. There have been persons who thought that when all the chief monuments were indexed and classified, we might sit down with folded hands and allow them slowly and gracefully to crumble into ruin. There have been others who argued that railways and irrigation did not leave even a modest half a lakh of rupees per annum for the requisite establishment to supervise\nthe most glorious galaxy of monuments in the world. Nevertheless, with these interruptions and exceptions, which I hope may never again recur, the progress has been positive, and on the whole, continuous. It was Lord Canning who first invested archaeological work in this country with permanent Government patronage by constituting in 1860, the Archaeological Survey of Northern India and by appointing General Cunningham in 1862 to be Archaeological Surveyor to Government. From that period date the publications of the Archaeological Survey of India, which have at times assumed different forms, and which represent varying degrees of scholarship and merit, but which constitute, on the whole, a noble mine of information, in which the student has but to delve in order to discover an abundant spoil. For over 20 years General Cunningham continued his labours, of which these publications are the memorial. Meanwhile orders were issued for the registration and preservation of historical monuments throughout India, local surveys were started in some of the subordinate Governments, the Bombay Survey being placed in the capable hands of Mr. Burgess, who was a worthy follower in the footsteps of Cunningham, and who ultimately succeeded him as Director-General of the Archaeological Survey. Some of the Native States followed the example thus set to them, and either applied for the services of the Government archaeologists, or established small departments of their own.\n\nIn the provinces much depended upon the individual tastes or proclivities of the Governor or Lieutenant-Governor, just as at head-quarters the strength of the impetus varied with the attitude of successive Viceroys. Lord Northbrook, who was always a generous patron of the arts, issued orders in 1873 as to the duties of Local Governments; and in his Viceroyalty, Sir John Strachey was the first Lieutenant-Governor to undertake a really noble work of renovation and repair at Agra\u2014a service which is fitly commemorated by a marble slab in the Palace of Shah Jehan. The poetic and imaginative temperament of Lord Lytton could not be deaf to a similar appeal. Holding that no claim upon the initiative and resources of the Supreme Government was more essentially Imperial than the preservation of national antiquities, he contributed in 1879 a sum of 3\u00bd lakhs to the restoration of buildings in the North-Western Provinces; and proposed the appointment of a special officer, to be entitled the Curator of Ancient Monuments, which, while it did not receive sanction in his time, was left to be carried out by his successor, Lord Ripon. During the three years that Major Cole held this post, from 1880 to 1883, much excellent work in respect both of reports and classification was done; and large sums of money were given by the Government of India, inter alia, for repairs in the Gwalior Fort and at\nSanchi Tope. But at the end of this time succeeded a period of some reaction, in which it appeared to be thought that the task of the Central Government, in the preparation of surveys and lists, was drawing to a close, and that Local Governments might, in future, be safely entrusted with the more modest, but, I may add, not less critical, duty of conservation. More recently, under Lord Elgin's auspices, the archaeological work of Government has been placed upon a more definite basis. The entire country has been divided into a number of circles, each with a surveyor of its own, and while the establishment is regarded as an Imperial charge, the work is placed under local control and receives such financial backing as the resources of the Local Governments or the sympathies of individual Governors may be able to give it. In the North-West Provinces, where I was recently touring, I found Sir A. MacDonnell worthily sustaining, in point of generous and discriminating sympathy, the traditions that were created by Sir John Strachey.\n\nFor my part I feel far from clear that Government might not do a good deal more than it is now doing, or than it has hitherto consented to do. I certainly cannot look forward to a time at which either the obligations of the State will have become exhausted, or at which archaeological research and conservation in this country can dispense with Government direction and control. I see fruitful fields of labour still unexplored, bad blunders still to be corrected, gaping omissions to be supplied, plentiful opportunities for patient renovation and scholarly research. In my opinion, the tax-payers of this country are in the last degree unlikely to resent a somewhat higher expenditure\u2014and, after all, a few thousand rupees go a long way in archaeological work, and the total outlay is exceedingly small\u2014upon objects in which I believe them to be as keenly interested as we are ourselves. I hope to assert more definitely during my time the Imperial responsibility of Government in respect of Indian antiquities, to inaugurate or to persuade a more liberal attitude on the part of those with whom it rests to provide the means, and to be a faithful guardian of the priceless treasure-house of art and learning that has, for a few years at any rate, been committed to my charge.\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nOF THE\n\nASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL,\n\nFOR MARCH, 1900.\n\nThe Monthly General Meeting of the Society was held on Wednesday, the 7th March, 1900, at 9-15 p.m.\n\nH.H. Sir John Woodburn, M.A., K.C.S.I., President, in the Chair.\n\nThe following members were present:\u2014\n\nMr. J. Bathgate, Rai Bahadur Chuni Lal Bose, Dr. T. Bloch, Dr. A. Krafft von Delmensingen, Mr. W. Dods, Mr. W. K. Dods, Mr. T. H. Holland, Mr. Chas. Michie, Baba Panchanan Mukerji, Mr. L. de Nic\u00e9ville, Mahamahapadhyaya Hara Prasad Shastri, Mr. E. Thornton.\n\nVisitors:\u2014Capt. Allanson, R.A., Rai Sohan Lal, Mr. A. Shrager, Mr. A. E. Westerhout.\n\nThe minutes of the last Monthly General Meeting and of the Annual Meeting held on the 3rd January and 7th February, 1900, at 9 p.m., respectively, were read and confirmed.\n\nNinety-one presentations were announced.\n\nRai Bahadur Chuni Lal Bose, M.B.; Mr. Chas. Michie; Mr. David Robb Wallace; and Dr. A. Krafft von Delmensingen, were elected Ordinary Members of the Society in accordance with Rule 7 at the Council Meeting held on 19th January, 1900.\n\nMr. A. U. Fanshawe, C.S.I., I.C.S.; Mr. W. S. Meyer, I.C.S., and Pandit Yogesha Chandra Shastree, were balloted for and elected Ordinary Members.\n\nMr. J. Kennedy, Mr. F. H. Harding and Mr. B. De, have expressed a wish to withdraw from the Society.\n\nThe President announced that in accordance with Rule 38 of the Society's Rules, the names of the following gentlemen had been posted\nup as defaulting members since the last Monthly General Meeting, and will be removed from the Member List and the fact published in the Proceedings.\n\nBabu Krishna Gopal Bhakta.\nRai Khirod Chandra Chowdhuri.\nBabu Gopal Ballabh Das.\n,, Mahendra Nath Ray.\n,, Suresh Chundra Samajpati.\n\nThe President also announced:\n\n(1) That the Council had offered their cordial thanks to Mr. E. Thornton for his report on the Survey of the Society's premises which was ordered to be communicated to the General Meeting.\n\n(2) That the Council had elected Mr. L. de Nic\u00e9ville as Natural History Secretary in the place of Mr. F. Finn, resigned.\n\nReport on the Society's Premises.\u2014By E. Thornton, A.R.I.B.A.\n\nThe structure shows signs of having suffered during the earthquake of 1897, but certain repairs were then undertaken which have rendered the building generally secure for the present. The chief structural defects noticeable at present are the bad state of the pillars supporting the roof over the staircase, and the bad state of certain beams and burgahs. I have had the whole of the beams and burgahs examined by competent masters and have ascertained the extent of the repairs necessary. There need be no fear of immediate danger from either of the above defects, except in the event of earthquake. The cost of putting the whole premises in reasonable structural and decorative repairs, would be according to my estimate about Rs. 9,000. This would include:\n\n1. Securing the staircase columns with iron bands and tie rods.\n2. Replacing defective beams with rolled steel joists and renewing burgahs.\n3. Repairing arches where defective.\n4. Repairing roofs where necessary.\n5. Renewing and repairing woodwork of doors and windows.\n6. Recolour-washing inside and outside throughout both main buildings and offices and making good plaster.\n7. Repainting and regilding.\n8. Making good broken glass and other petty repairs.\n\nIn conclusion, I would advise the Committee to set aside something yearly towards a \"Repair Fund\" so that at the end of four or five\nyears a round sum would be in hand to meet the cost of repainting and colour-washing, and any structural repairs that might become necessary. Rs. 1,000 yearly would, in my opinion, fully cover any ordinary re-decoration and repairs, and would, I think, leave over a substantial balance at the end of every four or five years to meet any unforeseen expenditure.\n\nMahamahopadhyaya Hara Prasad Shastri exhibited and described a Turquois Gane\u00e7a, and made the following remarks on it.\n\nOn the 6th February Mr. Hill, Librarian to the Imperial Library wrote to me a letter, enclosing a drawing from a carved piece of Turquois belonging to the Under-Secretary, Revenue and Agricultural Department, and expressing a hope that I might furnish him with an explanation of the details.\n\nOn examination the drawing proved to be that of Gane\u00e7a with the following curious features: (1) he has four faces; he rides on a lion; he has a \u00c7akti on his left in an amorous position; his legs are short and thick set.\n\nThe figure of Gane\u00e7a, as we ordinarily find it, has one face, the head of an elephant; with a proboscis, a pot-belly, with two, sometimes with four hands, painted bright red with one tusk, riding on a rat. In the grand image of Durg\u0101 and her family worshipped in October we find a plantain tree placed by the side of Gane\u00e7a covered over with a bright red-bordered cloth, ordinarily called \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0940 (the wife of Gane\u00e7a represented by a plantain tree); but really it is not intended as Gane\u00e7a\u2019s mate. It is in Sanskrit called \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0940, nine leaves, the real essence of Durg\u0101.\n\nThe drawing differs so greatly from our ordinary idea of Gane\u00e7a that I began searching on all sides for an explanation of the distinguishing features, and this was furnished from the Commentary by R\u0101ghava Bhatta on \u00c7\u0101rad\u0101tilaka, a well-known T\u0101ntrika work, in which 50 names of Gane\u00e7a and 50 names of his \u00c7aktis are given. Most of these names are names taken from his attributes, and two of these names are important for our purposes, namely, \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0940 and \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0940. The first epithet means that he rides sometimes on an infuriated animal and the second says he often has six heads. Now the word \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u0940 may mean any infuriated animal and in the drawing the lion with its mouth gaping wide open and with tail raised high up seems to be in fury. This furnished explanation on one of the points of detail. The other epithet \u201cwith six heads\u201d explains the fact that in the drawing, Gane\u00e7a has only four; because six heads all round, will show\nonly four when drawn on a plain surface. In Benares, I am told, the great Gane\u1e63a Dhan\u1e0dhir\u0101ja has replaced a six-headed figure of the same deity.\n\nAfter giving the fifty names of the \u00c7aktis of Gane\u1e63a the commentary proceeds to say that all the \u00c7aktis have some common attributes, two of which are to the point in this connection here, namely, that the \u00c7aktis sit, on the lap of Gane\u1e63a and that they are furnished with wreathes of red flowers; now, here the \u00c7akti is on the left lap of Gane\u1e63a the appropriate seat for a wife. One of Gane\u1e63a's thick set feet is outside her figure. The flower wreath is very prominent on her chest. She has a separate lotus seat. This furnishes a complete explanation of the details as given in the drawing.\n\nBut on an examination of the original Turquois figure Gane\u1e63a seemed to possess eight hands four on each side. In Bengal Gane\u1e63a has four and sometimes even two hands. But in Nepal the number of hands depends on the imagination of the Carver who may attribute any number of attributes to his deity. I have seen Gane\u1e63a with 18 hands and other deities, too, with any even number of hands.\n\nThe short and thick set legs pointed out to me that the Turquois figure was made in Nepal for in Northern India the limbs have a human proportion and in South India the most prominent feature of Gane\u1e63a is his belly. In fact, when I stood in front of a huge figure of Gane\u1e63a at the outer entrance of the great Temple of V\u012bra\u1e47a Ka\u015bc\u012b my guide, naively, told me \"what you do not seem to recognise this god, he is our great Belly God, Gane\u1e63a.\"\n\nMr. Maconochie, the Under-Secretary to the Revenue and Agricultural Department has subsequently assured me that his vendor got the figure from Nepal. He deserves the thanks of the Society for lending his valuable stone for exhibition to-night.\n\nThe following paper was read:\n\nOn the manuscript of a work on the biography of one of the P\u0101la-Kings of Magadha, R\u0101m P\u0101l.\u2014By Mahamahopadhyaya Hara Prasad Shastri, M.A.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nR\u0101macarita by Sandhy\u0101kara Nandi, Eleventh Century.\n\nR\u0101macarita may be said to be one of the most interesting finds. It is the first really historical manuscript found in Eastern India. It treats of the life and times of R\u0101map\u0101la Deva one of the P\u0101la Kings of Ga\u1e47\u1e0da. R\u0101map\u0101la is known from inscriptions to have been the son\nof Vigraha P\u0101la III. He was the youngest and ablest of three brothers Mahip\u0101la, \u012a\u015burap\u0101la and himself. The manuscript treats of R\u0101map\u0101la\u2019s wars with the rebellious Kaivartta King of V\u0101rendra named Bhima Divoka. In one sense the manuscript is a very difficult work as it is written throughout in double-entendre. Explained one way every verse gives some portion of the Story of R\u0101ma of the R\u0101m\u0101yana. Explained another way the same verse gives the history of R\u0101map\u0101la Deva. Had it not been accompanied with a Commentary it would have been almost impossible to understand the work. Unfortunately, however, the Commentary breaks off almost at the beginning of the second Canto and I purpose in this abstract to give the history of R\u0101map\u0101la\u2019s reign as far as it can be gleaned from the portion of the work covered by the commentary. The manuscript has been obtained from Nepal. It now belongs to the Government collection.\n\nThe manuscript of the Text is written in old Newari but the Commentary is written in old Bengali,\u2014much older than the character as revealed in the Bengali manuscripts written in 1198 and described in Professor Bendall\u2019s catalogue of manuscripts in Cambridge. The Author of the Text is Sandhy\u0101kara Nandi, the son of Praj\u0101pati Nandi the Minister of Peace and War of R\u0101map\u0101la Deva. The Author lived at the capital of the V\u0101rendra country, conquered by R\u0101map\u0101la, namely, in the city of Paundravardhana, which Dr. Blochmann identified with Pandua; but the identification has not yet been accepted as final. So the Author had very great opportunities of knowing what he writes about. The name of the Author of the Commentary is not given.\n\nWe come to know for the first time from this MS. that the P\u0101la Kings considered themselves as descendants of the Ocean God\u2014a fact which shows that they came from the sea-shore. We have Bengali works which state that Dharmap\u0101la and his descendants had relatives in the districts of Midnapore and Howrah.\n\nVigrahap\u0101la, the father of R\u0101map\u0101la, made a successful war against Kar\u1e47a King of D\u0101hala who belonged to the Chedi race and had his R\u0101j in what is now known as the Rewa territories. Kar\u1e47a was worsted in war and had to make peace by giving his daughter in marriage to his conqueror Vigraha who, thereupon, reinstated him. Now Kar\u1e47a of D\u0101hal is known to us from inscriptions. He is said to have established a new capital for his R\u0101j in a more inaccessible part of the Vindhya Mountains, owing it appears to the constant trouble he had from his powerful neighbours, the P\u0101las.\n\nMahip\u0101la, the elder brother of R\u0101map\u0101la, was a weak and impolitic Prince. His high-handed proceedings led the Kaivartta King of V\u0101rendra to rebel. His successful rebellion led to much loss of territory\nto the P\u0101la Empire. Mahip\u0101la fought against the rebels, was taken prisoner and put to death. \u010c\u0101rap\u0101la's reign was weak and inglorious. Then came R\u0101map\u0101la who made extensive preparations to crush the audacious Bh\u012bma. His maternal Uncle was Mathana or Mahana belonging to the R\u0101strak\u016bta race who held a high office under R\u0101map\u0101la's Government. His two sons were Maham\u0101ndale\u00e7varas and his nephew \u0100\u015bv\u0101r\u0101ja was the Mah\u0101pratil\u0101ha the Commander of Household troops. He was R\u0101map\u0101la's right-hand man. He went into V\u0101rendra to reconnoitre and then made great preparations. He summoned all the P\u0101la feudatories. Among these was the lord of the D\u0101ndabhukti. The word bhukti means province. We have in Sena inscriptions Pan\u1e0dravardhanabhukti and Vikramapurbhukti. We have Jej\u0101bhukti in the Mahoba territory and Tirabhukti the modern Tirhut. Now the question is what Province is known as D\u0101ndabhukti? I believe the Province of which the capital was Dandapura, modern Beh\u0101ra, as identified by Sir A. Cunningham, was D\u0101ndabhukti. The R\u0101j\u0101 of D\u0101ndabhukti had previously defeated Kar\u1e47a Ke\u00e7ari the R\u0101j\u0101 of Utkala. What strikes me as very curious is the fact that among the numerous feudatories there was a R\u0101j\u0101 of Magadha, Bh\u012bmaja\u00e7as by name, who routed the cavalry of the King of Kanoj. The cradle of the P\u0101la Empire was Magadha. Why should there be a feudatory R\u0101j\u0101 there is not clearly explained. The other feudatories were, Viraguna the R\u0101j\u0101 of Pi\u1e6dhi, described as the lord of the south. Vikrama, R\u0101j\u0101 of Devagr\u0101ma. Lak\u1e63hm\u012b\u00e7ura the R\u0101j\u0101 of the Forest region and of the Mand\u0101ra Hills; \u00c7ikhara of the race of Tail\u0101kampa and an expert in war with elephants and Bh\u0101skara Prat\u0101pa \u00c7\u012bla. Two great warriors are also mentioned, not as feudatories; one is Devaraksita of Pi\u1e6dhi and the other Sindhur\u0101ja.\n\nThey crossed the Ganges and entered the V\u0101rendra country. Bh\u012bma fought as R\u0101vana fought against R\u0101ma but was at last defeated and made a prisoner. The army of Kaivarttas was dispersed and Bh\u012bma was reduced to a very miserable condition. Here the Commentary breaks off. The Poem has four Cantos, namely\u2014\n\n1. \u0100rambhar\u0101ma, the commencement of the career of R\u0101ma.\n2. \u0100suricakra, the circle of Demons.\n3. R\u0101mapraty\u0101gamana, the return of R\u0101ma.\n4. Ramottaracarita, the last part of R\u0101ma's career.\n\nThe information most interesting to students of Buddhism is that R\u0101map\u0101la checked the progress of a religious revolution and led his people into the path ' pointed out by the good ' and this is the time, we know, when Mah\u0101y\u0101na doctrines received a fresh start and the Commentary on the Bodhicaryyy\u0101vatara and many other works were written.\nI have seen manuscripts of the A\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 copied during R\u0101map\u0101la's reign.\n\nMuch curious information is likely to be obtained from the rest of the poem if only the mystery in which it is enveloped could be solved without the aid of a Commentary.\n\nThe paper will be published in full in the Journal, Part I.\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nOF THE\n\nASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL,\n\nFOR APRIL, 1900.\n\nThe Monthly General Meeting of the Society was held on Wednesday, the 4th April, 1900, at 9-15 p.m.\n\nH.H.

Hamilton, I.C.S., who had been elected a Member of the Society on the 1st November, 1899, having not paid his Entrance fee, his name has been removed from the list according to Rule 9.\n(2) That in accordance with Rule 38 of the Society's Rules, the names of the following gentlemen had been posted up as defaulting members since the Monthly General Meeting held in January last, and will be removed from the Member List and the fact published in the Proceedings.\n\nMunshi Aziz-ud-din Ahmad,\nRaja Baikunta Nath De Bahadur,\nMaulvie Khuda Baksh Khan Bahadur,\nRai Rajkumar Sarvadhikari Bahadur,\nBabu Narendra Nath Sen,\nRaja Bhupendra Singh Bahadur.\n\nThe President also announced that the Council had resolved that a Monthly General Meeting of the Society be held in Simla on the first Wednesday in September next (on which day no meeting is held in Calcutta) for the convenience of members in Northern India and that the meeting be devoted to the reading of papers, the general business of the Society being conducted as usual in Calcutta.\n\nMah\u0101mahop\u0101dhy\u0101ya Hara Prasad \u010c\u0101stri exhibited a manuscript of Kul\u0101lik\u0101mn\u0101ya\u2014a Tantric work in Gupta character of the seventh century and made the following remarks on it.\n\nIn exhibiting this manuscript he offered the following observations:\n\n(1) It has been obtained from Nepal.\n\n(2) There are 77 leaves in the MS. in Gupta and one in Nev\u0101ri character. Seventy-two of the leaves are in tolerably good preservation, five being dilapidated. Leaves 34, 40 to 49, 69, 72 to 84, 86 to 89, 94, 96, 97, 100 to 104, 106 to 109, 111 to 165, 167 to 187, 189 to 259 are missing. The highest number marked 260. The leaves have holes for the string not in the middle but slightly to the right as in the Bower MSS.\n\n(3) The character is Gupta. I have carefully compared the letters with charts of Gupta Alphabet and I believe that in pronouncing it to belong to the seventh century I have erred rather in making it more modern than it really is. The shape of letters agree more with those of Horiuzi Palm-leaves than with any other and the age of the Horiuzi Palm-leaves has been set down at 550 A.D. As they are said to be in Japan since the year 609 A.D. The most useful criterion in determining the age of an old manuscript, is to see how many letters have open tops. The proportion of open tops in the present MSS. appears to be much larger than in the ninth century Gupta Palm-leaves photographed in Professor Bendall's Cambridge Catalogue.\n(4) In the Colophons the work Kul\u0101lik\u0101mn\u0101ya is said to be a part of a larger work on Tantra entitled Kubjik\u0101mata. The extent of Kubjik\u0101mata is said to be 24,000 \u0101lokas and that of the Kul\u0101lik\u0101mn\u0101ya 6,000 only. Fortunately I brought some portion of the Kubjik\u0101mata from Nepal last year and on comparison I find that some verses of this work are identical with some verses of that. Both have the same interlocutors, namely, Bhairava and the Devi. The scene is laid in both on the Himalayas at a place named Sant\u0101napura a triangular city with three walls, three door-keepers, three gates. It is a rich city inhabited both by celestials and terestrials.\n\n(5) The Tantras are regarded as very recent works. Some distinguished orientalists have pronounced them to belong to the fourteenth century. The appearance of this MSS. disproves that assertion. But I will not say anything on this topic today as I purpose to read a paper on the Tantrika MSS. in Gupta character at an early date.\n\n(6) The pagination is curious. At the right hand side of each leaf there are four letters one below the other. The top letter is \u00c7ri. Below it is the figure. Below the figure is Ma and below it S. The whole seems to be an abbreviation of \u00c7ri mate Sat\u0101hasre, page \u2014, i.e., page so and so in the compilation running through 6000 verses of the School of the Goddess \u00c7ri.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1.

On a Supplement of the Celebrated Lexicon Amarakosa by a Buddhist author in very ancient Bengali character.\u2014By Mah\u0101mahop\u0101dhy\u0101ya Hara Prasad \u010c\u0101stri, M.A.\n\nOf this supplement which seems to have run through about one hundred leaves we have got only the first, the eighty-fourth the eighty-fifth with distinct page numbers and another with the page number broken off. But all the leaves are precious the first leaf specially.\n\nThe Amarakosa is very well-known. It was composed by Amarasimha one of the nine gems of the Court of the legendary Vikram\u0101ditya who seems to have flourished by the middle of the Sixth Century A.D. The Author was a Br\u0101hma\u1e47a and a worshipper of \u015aiva. But he subsequently became a Buddhist and is said to have built the great Temple at Bodh Gay\u0101. His invocation at the beginning of his Kosa though thoroughly Buddhistic in tone does not name any deity and so it has been variously interpreted by commentators of different persuasions.\n\nBut the Author of the Supplement had no reason to keep the name of his deity in the background. He boldly makes his obeisance to the Munindra and to such Hindu deities as have their place in the Buddhist Pantheon. In the second verse he says his attempt is confined to such names as were not used by people when Amara wrote but which have come into use since his time. He retains the arrangement and the technicalities of Amara and makes it in every sense a supplement.\n\nThe character (Bengali) is much more archaic than that of the palm-leaves photographed in Professor Bendal's Cambridge Catalogue. In fact it is intermediate between Gupta and old Bengali. If my memory serves me right I saw something like it in Dharmaditya's Copper-plate Grant obtained from Barisal. There is one feature in these leaves which is absolutely unique; I mean the use of something like commas and semi-colons. Each word is separated from its neighbour by a comma or rather a slanting stroke resembling the Bengali h\u0101santa mark. Unlike the European comma it has not the point and the curve but it does all the work of a comma in separating various synonyms. Where one set of synonyms end within a verse there are two slanting strokes doing the duty of a semi-colon. The use of these signs makes the reading of the work comparatively easy.\nPurusottama, the Author of the supplement, has not only retained the arrangement, the division of chapters, &c., of Amara but has also followed his order of words, adding new synonyms where necessary and putting in new words and sets of synonyms where, had these been in use, Amara would have put them. Amara makes a distinction between Buddha and \u010c\u0101kyamuni the former meaning a hypothetical being and the latter the great reformer of the sixth century B.C. Of the first Amara gives 18 synonyms and Purusottama adds 37 new names. Amara gives only four names of Buddha of the sixth century B.C. Purusottama adds four more, Savarhasiddha, Mah\u0101\u00e7ramana, Kulicasana, and Gope\u00e7a. He adds the names of the members of Gautama's family such as Yo\u00e7omati, R\u0101hula, Devadatta and so on. He also adds the name of Avalokite\u00e7vara and gives many synonyms, one of which is Padmap\u0101ni. In the names of the Sungod Purusottama adds new words one of which is Padmap\u0101ni. This will explain the fact that the figures of Avalokite\u00e7vara and of the Sungod are often confounded. Both have almost the same figure in Nepal. In Bengal too I have seen images of Avalokite\u00e7vara worshipped as the Sun by Hindus in shrines which are undoubtedly Buddhistic. My only regret is that we have got only four-leaves. I propose to publish these leaves with notes in the Journal.\n\n5. Note on a method of detecting free Phosphorus.\u2014By P. B. Mukerji, B.Sc., Professor of Chemistry, Presidency College, Calcutta.

Note on the Plague in India during the reign of the Emperor Aurangzeb.\u2014By Maulavi Abdul Wali.\n\nIn two notes on Tulsi-D\u0101s and the Plague in Benares published respectively in the Proceedings of the Society for March and May, 1898, Dr. Grierson says that the Plague, which raged in India in the reign of Jah\u0101ng\u012br, was probably the cause of the death of the poet Tulsi-D\u0101s. Dr. Bloch, in a supplementary note to the first paper of Dr. Grierson, adds that the Plague broke out in March, 1616 A.D., and lasted eight years.\n\nOne of the symptoms of the disease, mentioned by the Emperor in his Tuzuk-i-Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b, and by the poet Tulsi-D\u0101s in his R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, (according to the above notes) was the extremely painful boils and bubos which appeared in the groins or armpits. The Plague first appeared in the Panj\u0101b, spread in all the towns and villages in the neighbourhood of \u0100gra, but there was no trace of it at F\u0101\u1e6dhpur-Sikri. The disease again increased in the cold weather.\n\nAnother most terrible outbreak of the Plague or T\u0101'\u016bn occurred in the thirty-second year (1100 A.H. = 1688-89 A.D.) of the Emperor Aurangzeb's reign at Bij\u0101pur, and is mentioned in the Ma'\u0101\u1e63ir-i-'\u0100lamg\u012br\u012b. The following are the particulars:\n\nIn Muharram of the year 1100 A.H., (=October-November 1688 A.D.) the pestilence, Plague, broke out in a virulent type at Bij\u0101pur, at a time when the Emperor and his army were encamped at that city. It burst forth suddenly, and spread rapidly. A terrible mortality ensued, and it struck terror into every heart. All ceremonies of pleasure were abandoned. The world sat bewailing. Verily it was the Day of Judgment (qiyy\u0101mat) that came upon the people, or an annihilating blast that was about to sweep away the human species.\n\nUnder the armpit or in the groin a boil appeared, fever and delirium (madh\u016bgh\u012b) of such a peculiar type came upon the patient that no treatment gave him relief. The patient died of the pestilence generally in a day or two and sometimes in three days. Those who were so fortunate as to remain safe from its attack, were so much frightened that they considered themselves as dead. In fact, it came to such a pass, that none would care for the other. The cry of nafsi, nafsi, (myself, myself), was heard everywhere. Nim-J\u0101n\u0101n, i.e., those who were half dead with fright and consternation, having forsaken their everyday business, were only waiting for the hour of death. The maid-of-honour of Her Majesty Aurang\u0101b\u0101d\u012b Mahal (the Empress), Mu\u1e25ammadi R\u0101j, son of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Jaswant Singh, F\u0101\u017cil Kh\u0101n, the \u1e62adr, and a host of other nobilities succumbed to the\nPlague. The middle class as well as the masses died in large numbers. Their number was estimated to be about 100,000 (one lak). The eyes, tongue and ears of those whose head or brain was affected, became useless. Gh\u0101zi-d-Din Kh\u0101n Bah\u0101dur Fir\u016bz Jang also had an attack of the Plague. Though he recovered, he lost his eyesight.* It is useless to speak of the public. In fact no old men, nor any of the chroniclers can ever give an instance of such a terrible outbreak of the pestilence, or such a heavy mortality and the commotion caused thereby. The Plague lasted for two months. Its fury stopped after a week.\n\nIt is curious that the t\u0101r\u012bkh (date) of this outbreak was\u2014\n\n\u0642\u06cc\u0627\u0645\u062a \u0628\u06cc\u062f \u0634\u06cc\u0631 \u0648 \u0628\u0648\n\n\"Was it the Day of Judgment, or the commotion caused by the pestilence.\"\u2020\n\nHis Majesty relying on God and maintaining the presence of his mind and his indomitable will, was a looker-on of the doings of the destiny. He left Bij\u0101pur in Rabi'-u-l-awwal, and proceeded on to invade the territory of the Marhatta Sambh\u0101, who was taken prisoner immediately.\n\nFrom the above facts, we may conclude\u2014\n\n1. That the Plague now invading India for the first time, during the sovereignty of the British, is not a new visitor to India. It broke out in the reigns of the Mughal Emperors Jah\u0101ng\u012br and Aurangzeb and probably in other periods especially during the rule of the later Mughals.\u2021\n\n2. That the present epidemic of Plague is undoubtedly more severe and widespread in the Bombay Presidency than in other parts of\n\n* Vide Ma'\u0101\u1e63iru-l-Umar\u0101 (Bib. Ind. Ed. Vol. II, p. 875).\n\n\u2020 The Mi\u1e63ra' Qi\u1e0d\u0101mat b\u0101d y\u0101 \u1e0dh\u016br-i-wab\u0101 b\u0101d gives 1101 A.H. instead of 1100 A.H. The Ma'\u0101\u1e63iru-l-Umar\u0101 (Vol. III, pp. 32-33), says that F\u0101\u017cil Kh\u0101n Sh\u0101h\u012bn Makhd\u016bm \u1e62adr died of the pestilence that had broken out in the Lashkar (army) of '\u0100lamg\u012br in the 32nd year of His Majesty's reign, corresponding with 1099 A.H. It appears that the author while correctly quoting the regnal year, was misled from the heading of the Chapter in the Ma'\u0101\u1e63ir-i-'\u0100lamg\u012bri, which gives both the regnal and Hijri years. But the regnal year did not end till Rama\u1e0d\u0101n, while the Hijri year ended in Zul-Hijja, hence the discrepancy. Again, '\u0100lamg\u012br reached Bij\u0101pur on the 22nd Jum\u0101d\u0101 I. 1099 A.H. He celebrated his next Jul\u0101s in Shaww\u0101l, and did not leave the city till Rabi' I. A.H. 1100. The Plague broke out while the Emperor was in the city, in the middle of Mu\u1e25arram. So the year cannot but be 1100 A.H. or 1688 A.D.\n\n\u2021 It is stated that Ahmad Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101n\u012b had to leave Hindust\u0101n on account of the pestilence (Wab\u0101) that broke out in his army (Lashkar) in the neighbourhood of Akbar\u0101b\u0101d (\u0100gra) in or about 1173 A.H. Was this the Plague? I have no material at present to prosecute an enquiry on the subject (vide M. Umar\u0101 II, 720 and III, 892). But \u1e6ca'\u016bn and Wab\u0101 very often mean the same disease.\nIndia, as the Plague in the same tract in the reign of the Emperor Aurangzeb was far more severe than the one that had broken out in Jah\u0101ng\u012br's time.\n\n3. That the symptoms of the disease stated are on fours with those of the pestilence now raging in India.\n\nNo record of an outbreak of the Plague in Bengal is to be found.* The present outbreak has shown that Bengal is not the place where the disease can take a firm hold. Had there been no railways or steam-ships, or were not Calcutta the Capital of Hindust\u0101n, it is likely that Bengal would have escaped entirely this time also.\n\nIt is for the leisured antiquarians to find out, from the extant records and Chronicles, of the past, if there were other outbreaks of the disease in India in pre-British times.\n\n2.

The relationship of drinking water; water-logging and the distribution of Anopheles Mosquitoes, respectively to the prevalence of Malaria North of Calcutta.\u2014By Leonard Rogers, M.D., M.R.C.P., I.M.S., Professor of Pathology, Medical College, Calcutta.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn February last (1900), I carried out an inquiry into the health of the tract of country just North of Calcutta and extending up along the east bank of the Hooghly as far as Naihati, some 25 miles, with special reference to the prevalence of malaria. The percentage of people with enlarged spleens was taken as the most reliable test, and over 5,000 persons were examined by myself, the degree of enlargement of the organ being noted. The ground water levels were taken in as many wells as possible, as the unhealthiness of this part has for years been considered to be due to water-logging. The drinking water supply was also noted, and the monthly number of admissions for fever in 10 of the principle dispensaries for the last six years was compared with the monthly rainfall the order to ascertain the seasonal influences. Lastly, some observations were made on the distribution of the anopheles mosquito larva.\nThe following table shows the percentage of persons found to suffer from enlargement of the spleen in each municipality. They are arranged in order from above downwards as they are situated on the map from north to south, while the westernly ones which lie on the east bank of the Hooghly are placed above, and the easterly ones, which lie at a little distance from the river are placed below in the following table:\n\n### TABLE I.\n\n| Municipality          | Spleen Percentage |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|\n| Naihati               | 19\u00b79              |\n| Bhatpara              | 20\u00b70              |\n| Garnlia               | 33\u00b78              |\n| North Barrackpore     | 36\u00b75              |\n| Titagarh              | 37\u00b78              |\n| South Barrackpore, West| 25\u00b72             |\n| Kamarhati             | 18\u00b78              |\n| Baranagar             | 17\u00b78              |\n| Chitpore-Cossipore    | 11\u00b72              |\n| **Average**           | **24\u00b75**          |\n\n(Gobardanga) ... ... ...

The question arises is to whether the riverine parts are exceptionally healthy or the inland portions especially unhealthy for this part of Bengal, and in order to settle this I examined several hundred people in Basirhat and Gobardanga, which are situated some 25 miles further to the east, and found their spleen rates to be over 50 per cent. It is evident, then, that the riverine portions are\nexceptionally healthy for Lower Bengal, but the reason remains to be found.\n\nOne very marked exception will be found to the above rule, namely, that Maniktolla although at some distance from the river, yet has a very low spleen rate, the lowest of all the thirteen areas except Chitpore-Cossipore, facts which can only be explained as being due to these two municipalities being the only ones of the lot which have a full filtered water supply. Moreover, this low rate occurs in spite of these two places being the most water-logged in the whole area, their ground water levels being but from 4 to 5 feet below the surface in the dry season, and from 1 to 2 feet down only during the rains.\n\nThis result was somewhat surprising in view of recent work on malaria, so advantage was taken of the fact that certain wards of some of the municipalities were partially supplied with filtered water from standpipes provided by certain of the mills within them to examine more closely into the question. The result was ample confirmation of the relationship of the water supply to the spleen rate, illustrative examples of which are as follows. Naihati is divided up into five wards, beginning from the south. The first three are mainly inhabited near the river, and their spleen rates are 19\u00b75, 10\u00b78 and 19 respectively. The very low rate of Ward II coincides with a partial filtered water supply from a mill, which is the only difference between them that can account for the figures. The two most northernly wards are mainly inhabited at a distance of about two miles from the river, and their water supply is mainly from tanks, and although their ground water level is slightly lower than that of Ward III, yet their spleen rates are 22\u00b77 and 27\u00b79. The water supply of Wards I and III is mainly from the Hooghly. Still more striking are the figures for Garulia, in the northern portion of which is a mill which has been supplying filtered water for two years only, during which time the number of cases of fever treated at the local dispensary has fallen to about one-third of what it was before the filtered water came into use, and the greatest improvement took place in the very year that every other dispensary in this area show a great increase of fever. As, moreover, the native inhabitants were very positive that those who drunk the filtered water suffered much less from fever than those who did not, I decided to examine 100 people near the mill, about 80 per cent. of whom had drunk filtered water, and another series at a short distance away, but within one mile of the former, and living under identical conditions, but who differed from the former in not having been accustomed to drink filtered water. The spleen rate was found to be 21\u00b71 per cent. in the former, and 55\u00b75, or\nmore than two and a half times as great in the latter, which strikingly confirms the local opinion as to the relative immunity of filtered water drinkers from malaria.\n\nTittagarh, two out of the four wards of which have a partial filtered water supply from mills, afforded a good opportunity of putting the matter to a crucial test, so a note was made of the water drunk by nearly all the people examined. The results are shown in the following tables.\n\n**TABLE II.**\n\n**Ground Water Level.**\n\n| Area     | February | Rains, 1899 |\n|----------|----------|-------------|\n| Ward IV. | ...      | 10 ft. 1 in.| 1 ft. 3 in. |\n| Ward III.| ...      | 10 ft. 6 in.| 1 ft. 6 in. |\n| Ward II. | ...      | ........    | ........    |\n| Ward I.  | ...      | 18 ft. 4 in.| 6 ft. 0 in. |\n\n**Drinking Water Supply.**\n\n| Drinking Water Supply | Spleen Percentage |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|\n| River and tank water  | 48                |\n| One-third drank filtered water | 30 |\n| 82 per cent. drank filtered water | 19 |\n| River and tank water  | 54\u00b78              |\n\nThe much lower spleen rates in Wards II and III which had a partially filtered water supply, and that too in proportion to the number of persons examined who had drunk the filtered water is evident. But this is not all for it will be seen from Table III below that the spleen rate among 140 filtered-water drinkers is 26\u00b74 per cent., that among 179 river-water drinkers was 41\u00b78, while out of 55 tank-water drinkers (who it should be noted form a minority here), it was no less than 67\u00b72 per cent. Further, only 38 per cent. of filtered water drinkers in which the spleen was enlarged, was it considerably (two finger-breadths below the ribs) or markedly so, while in 62 per cent. it was only just felt between below the ribs. In river-water drinkers it was much enlarged in 67 per cent. and slightly so in 43 per cent., while in tank-water drinkers it was much enlarged in 73 per cent., and slightly so in only 27 per cent. Not only, then, is the spleen much more frequently enlarged in river and tank water drinkers than in those who drink filtered water, but the degree of enlargement is also much greater in the former than in the latter.\nTABLE III. ENLARGEMENT.\n\nSpleen Percentage and Water Supply.\n\n| Filtered water | River water | Tank water | Total |\n|----------------|-------------|------------|-------|\n| Spleen not enlarged | 108         | 105        | 18    | 226   |\n| Spleen just felt   | 23 (62%)    | 32 (43%)   | 10 (27%) | 65    |\n| Spleen considerably enlarged | 9 (24%) | 26 (36%) | 15 (40%) | 50    |\n| Spleen markedly enlarged | 5 (18%) | 16 (21%) | 12 (33%) | 33    |\n| Total examined     | 140         | 179        | 55    | 374   |\n\nPercentage of enlarged spleens: 26.4%, 41.8%, 67.2%, 39.5%\n\nIf now the spleen rates for the different municipalities as shown in Table I (and in the Map), be now examined in the light of the figures just given it will be evident that the difference in the water supply will explain all the facts in a way that no other hypothesis will do. Thus, Chitpore-Cossipore has the lowest spleen rates, and it has the double advantage of both a full filtered water supply and close proximity to the river. The influence of the latter is well illustrated by the fact that the spleen rate of the two riverine wards is only 7 per cent., while that of the other two wards which are from one to two miles from the river, is 15 per cent., or just about the same as that of Maniktolla, which is similarly situated. The obvious explanation is that those who do not take the trouble to get the filtered water will drink river water in the wards on its bank, while in those at a distance they will drink tank water. The same point is illustrated by the differences between the spleen rates of the western portions of Kamarhati and South Barrackpore and the eastern portions of the same municipalities, the former with a water supply from the river having just about half the spleen rate as the latter with only tank water for drinking purposes. In short the much lower rate of the riverine parts is due to the difference in the water supply, for as will be shown presently, there is no essential difference in the ground water level which can explain this distribution. The good effect of even a partial water supply is once more shown by the ward variations of the spleen rate in Baranagar and South Dum Dum. In the former the lowest spleen rate, namely, 11.6, is met with in the most southerly of the riverine wards, which borders on Cossipore, and I found that many of the inhabitants of the small ward were getting their filtered water from Cossipore. Again the only ward which is at a little distance from the river in this municipality has the highest spleen rate, being dependant on tank water to a great extent.\nSouth Dum Dum is divided into three wards, and one of these which borders on Cossipore, from which many of the people whom I examined were accustomed to get filtered water had only a spleen rate of 11\u00b78, against one of 35\u00b74 and 45\u00b73 in the other two wards which had only tank water, although in all other respects I could find no difference between the wards. The very fact of the people taking the trouble to carry filtered water from a distance, and their robust belief that they to a large extent escape fever by so doing, must be allowed some weight in favour of the correctness of their belief. The whole of the evidence, then, points to the water supply as the determining factor in relationship to the relative amount of malaria in this tract of country, but other possible factors must be considered, the most important of which is water-logging.\n\n**Water-Logging and the Railway.**\n\nIt has already been pointed out that Maniktolla and Chitpore-Cossipore are the most water-logged parts of the whole area, and yet they are the least malarious, owing to their filtered water supply. Further, an examination of the spleen rate and the ground water level ward by ward shows that there is no relationship between the height of the ground water level and the percentage of inhabitants with large spleens. At first sight the fact that the bank of the Hooghly river is very slightly higher than the surrounding country, so that the drainage flows away from the river and eventually finds its way back through khals, or runs into the Great Salt Lake to the East of Calcutta, might appear to indicate that the eastern portions of this area must have a higher ground water level than those near the river bank. Measurements in the wells, however, do not bear this out, for there is very little difference in this respect, while what little there is is rather more frequently in favour of the eastern portions than against them. Further if different wards of the same municipalities are compared no definite or constant relationship between the slight variations in the ground water level which are met with and the spleen rate is found, as a study of the tables in the full paper or the map will show.\n\nThe Eastern Bengal Railway, which runs from north to south through this area, and together with the grand trunk road roughly divides the western and eastern portions, has frequently been held to be responsible for the unhealthiness of the country, for it lies across the line of drainage. As, however, the drainage flows from west to east it is obvious that if it materially obstructs the drainage the part to the west of its course should be the more unhealthy, while precisely the opposite is the case. Moreover, in places in which wells were\nfound on either side of the railway, although not very near it, there was no marked or constant difference in the ground water levels on either side of the railway. The differences in the spleen rates in this tract of country cannot, then, be explained on any theory of waterlogging, or interference with drainage by railways or roads, although the natural drainage of places is certainly bad, as in North Dum-Dum.\n\nAgain, it might be thought that the lower rate in the western parts might be due to greater density of population, and consequently less fever breeding grounds for the anopheles mosquitos. With regard to the former it may be pointed out that there was practically no difference in the spleen rate of the densely populated western portion of Maniktolla and the very sparsely populated and somewhat more water-logged eastern part of the same place, both having a filtered water supply, and other similar instances could be given. Further the great differences in the spleen rates of the contiguous wards of the same municipalities in which every condition except the water supply are precisely similar, which have already been detailed, cannot be explained on any theory of varying density of population, or of mosquito breeding grounds.\n\n**Distribution of the Anopheles Mosquitos.**\n\nThe question of the relationship of the anopheles mosquitos to the prevalence of malaria remains to be considered. It must now be taken as proved that malaria may be communicated to man through the bites of mosquitos which have some days previously bitten another case of malaria, but it still remains to be proved whether this is the only or even the most common cause by which this protean disease is communicated. The point is one of the utmost importance to Bengal, one of the principal homes of malaria, for if the disease is only communicated by the bites of these tiny pests, and they only breed in certain small pools, namely, those which are too small to harbour fish, yet not so small as to dry up in a day or two, as Major Ross states is the case, then by searching out these breeding grounds and destroying the larvae in the pools we may hope with Ross to at least rid towns or small areas of malaria. Unfortunately I have not been able to confirm these last statements of Ross, for both at Gobardanga and at Maniktolla, which are at the extreme of the tract of country under observation, I easily found numerous anopheles larvae both in tanks and in smaller pools all of which contained very numerous fish. As it was impossible to minutely examine 100 square miles or so of this area I determined to map out and closely search all the pools and tanks in\na small area of the Maniktolla Municipality. The results which were obtained are as interesting as they were unexpected. I much regret that I have not been able to confirm Major Ross' observations as to the very localised and small number of the breeding places of anopheles mosquitos. On the contrary I found them very commonly in large tanks, and that too in spite of most of them swarming with fish. In fact in the dry season when small pools are few in number the tanks are the common breeding place. Further, although I found them in two out of three very small pools (from two to five yards in diameter), and with but some two inches of water in them, these pools also contained small fish, which during some time that I watched them did not touch one of the anopheles larvae which floated temptingly past their noses, although they eat several small beetles, which they appeared to prefer. If then, the larvae can survive in spite of fish in such tiny pools is it any cause for wonder that they live in tanks.\n\nThe question then arises as to whether there is any relationship between the number of anopheles and the amount of fever, in order to test which I resolved to make a monthly examination of some thirty tanks, together with any pools near them in a small area of Maniktolla. These observations will have to be continued for a year, but it may be mentioned here that during the dry season, when malaria fevers were at a minimum, from one-third to two-thirds of the tanks have been found to harbour the anopheles larvae, and that too at a time when three visits to the local dispensary, after having given notice that all fever cases were to be kept for me to see, I failed to obtain a single case. Yet some of the tanks were estimated to have contained over one million larvae, so thickly were they lying near the leeward bank in particular. In short it would have taken a very large number of the small pools to harbour as many larvae as one of these tanks, so that in this area the tanks form the principal breeding ground in the dry season at any rate. It will be very interesting to see what happens in the rainy season, but I may mention that after the recent heavy rain the larvae nearly disappeared from the tanks, and were enormously reduced in numbers in spite of several new small infected pools having appeared, so that further observations promise to be of interest.\n\nThe importance of the above observations lies in the impossibility of destroying all the anopheles larvae in even a very small area in Bengal, for the thirty tanks mentioned above all lay within an area of one-sixteenth of a square mile, and formed but a small fraction of those of the very small municipality of Maniktolla, so that unless some very much more potent method of destroying mosquitos is discovered I\nfear that Bengal will not have its malaria much reduced by Ross' ingenious suggestions. If, too, all malaria is due to the bites of these mosquitos and they are present in such great numbers in the minimal fever season, how many will be found in the maximal fever period, and how great will be the difficulty of destroying them?\n\nIt may be objected that possibly many of the anopholes found by me in the tanks were varieties which do not carry malaria, but until we know which are harmless and can easily distinguish them at a glance, this will not lessen the difficulty of destroying the really dangerous ones, if indeed any of them are harmless.\n\nThe importance of the action of a filtered water supply in greatly reducing the amount of malaria, which has been demonstrated in this paper, is enhanced by the great difficulty of destroying the malaria-bearing mosquito, and also raises the question as to whether these insects may not carry the infection from cases of fever back to the water of tanks, etc., and the disease may not commonly be obtained by drinking such infected water, which has for centuries been considered to be a frequent medium through which the disease may be obtained. This important question can only be settled by experiment, which I hope shortly to be able to undertake.\n\nLastly, many charts have been made showing the monthly number of fever cases treated in the dispensaries of this area together with the monthly rainfall. It appears from these that the conditions which influence the amount of fever in different years is a general one, for all the dispensaries show very similar curves in the same year (except when the water supply has been materially altered as in the case of Garulia) so that some general cause must have been in operation. On the other hand, there is no definite relationship between low or heavy annual rainfall and the amount of fever, as I have shown elsewhere is the case on laterite soil with rapid ground water variations. There does, however, seem to be some relationship between the daily distribution of the rain and the amount of fever, but my observations on this point are not sufficiently advanced to allow of any definite statement on the subject at present.\n\nThe broad result of the present inquiry, then, is simply that there is a very definite relationship between the drinking water and the amount of malaria, as judged by the spleen rate in this alluvial area.\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nOF THE\n\nASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL,\n\nFOR AUGUST, 1900.\n\nThe Monthly General Meeting of the Society was held on Wednesday, the 1st August, 1900, at 9.15 P.M.\n\nMajor A.

It is a work on the treatment of fever and other diseases by medicine, incantation and charms. It is addressed to Bibhisana the brother and successor of Ravana. Bibhisana is said to be immortal and the work is addressed to him. This work is to be differentiated from the celebrated work entitled Lankavatara s\u016btra of the\nBuddhists. This is Hindu and tantra written in verse and that is Buddhistic sutra work written in verbose prose and verse.\n\nI examined another work entitled Ni\u1e63v\u0101sa-tattva-samhit\u0101 at the same Library, written in a Gupta character older than the preceding. This is perhaps the first time that an important original tantrik work has been found complete. It bears no date but it must be more than a century older than the other. The scene is laid in the Naimis\u0101ranya the traditional home of the Puranas and the interlocutors are R\u1e63is or Ancient Indian Sages. The subject of their conversation is the dik\u1e63\u0101 or initiation other than Vaidic. The R\u1e63is wonder how can there be such a thing as dik\u1e63\u0101 without any reference to the Vedas. But the eldest among them explains to them that even the great Gods like Brahma, Visnu and others received non-Vedic dik\u1e63\u0101 at the very spot they were sitting upon.\n\nThe third T\u0101ntrik work in Gupta character has been very recently acquired for the Asiatic Society. It is a fragment written in character older than the preceding. It is a portion of the Kulalik\u0101m\u0101ya which again is a part of a much larger work entitled Kubjik\u0101mata. I exhibited this work at the April meeting of the Asiatic Society which was presided over by His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal.\n\nThe discovery of these three works pushes back the antiquity of the tantras to about the fifth or sixth century A.D., the time of Asanga, credited by the Buddhists with the introduction of Tantra into their religion (see page 208 Buddhism by Rhys Davis).\n\n(2). The other discovery I have made is not so much from books and MSS. as from actual observation in Nepal. It was always a puzzle to me that the pure metaphysical religion of Buddha could be made the medium of practising immoral and obscene rites. The Buddhist Trinity Dharma (Religion) Buddha and Sangha (Buddhist monastic congregation) are merely abstract ideas personified. All the three words are in masculine gender. How can there be the introduction of female divinities and subsequent obscene rites? But on entering the Holiest of the Great places of Pilgrimage in Nepal, the Svambhu Ksetra, I was struck with a female figure labelled or inscribed as Namo dharmaya. I at once enquired from the Residency Pandit, a Buddhist high-priest himself and the descendant of the most learned of Buddhist Pandits ever met with by the English in Nepal. He coolly said Dharma is nothing else but Praj\u00f1\u0101. I had often read in Buddhist works the phrase Prajnop\u0101yasa\u1e41v\u0101din or svar\u016bp\u0101ya. I know that Buddha is never an object of worship. His image is kept in monasteries simply for the purpose of keeping his noble example always present before the aspirers to Nirv\u0101\u1e47a, and so he is the Up\u0101ya or means to Nirv\u0101\u1e47a. I also knew that Praj\u00f1\u0101 or true knowledge is the great goal of those who aspired to Nirv\u0101\u1e47a. But none ever suspected that Dharma and Praj\u00f1\u0101 are\nidentical. This identification introduced a female deity into the Buddhist Trinity and she at once became the mother of all Bodhisattvas, beings representing the sangha or the Buddhist congregation. In a MS. in the Durbar library belonging to the K\u0101lacakra School I subsequently saw illustrations of Buddha and Praj\u00f1\u0101 in the unspeakable situation begetting Bodhisattvas. This information led to the explanation of many facts and symbolisms unexplained before. Buddhism subsequently became closely allied to \u00c7akti worship and its later development ran in parallel lines with that of \u00c7akti cult.\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nOF THE\n\nASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL.\n\nFOR OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER, 1900.\n\nA General Meeting of the Society for the reading of papers was held at Simla on the 5th October, 1900, at 5 p.m.\n\nH.

Description of a new Himalayan genus of Orobanche\u00e6.\u2014By J. S. Gamble, M.A., F.R.S., and Major D. Prain, I.M.S., LL.D.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis new genus Gleadovia Gamble and Prain, is dedicated to Mr. F. Gleadow who first actually found it. It has the facies of\na *Christisonia* but differs from that genus in having both anther-cells perfect; the corolla 2-labiate and the stigma equally 2-lobed.\n\nIt is nearest to *Conopholis* with which it agrees as to corolla and stamens but from which it differs as regards calyx and stigma. From *Boschniackia* it differs somewhat as regards corolla and greatly as regards stamens. From *Xylanche* (*Boschniackia himalaica*) it further differs in having 2 carpels not 3. From all three genera it differs as regards inflorescence which is spicate in those but paniculate in *Gleadovia*.\n\n(2). *The Humours of Coin-collecting.*\u2014By R.

The endowment for these prizes is based on the Will, dated 27th November 1895, of the late Dr. A. B. Nobel, engineer, who stipulated as follows:\n\n\"The remainder of the fortune which I shall leave shall be disposed of in the following manner: The capital, converted into safe investments by the executors of my Will, shall constitute a fund the interest of which shall be distributed annually as a reward to those who, in the course of the preceding year, shall have rendered the greatest services to humanity. The sum total shall be divided into five equal portions, assigned as follows:\n\n\"(1). To the person having made the most important discovery or invention in the department of physical science.\n\n\"(2). To the person having made the most important discovery or having produced the greatest improvement in chemistry.\n\n\"(3). To the author of the most important discovery in the department of physiology or of medicine.\n\n\"(4). To the author having produced the most notable literary work in the sense of idealism.\n\n\"(5). To the person having done the most, or the best, in the work of establishing the brotherhood of nations, for the suppression or the reduction of standing armies, as well as for the formation and the propagation of peace conferences.\n\n\"The prizes will be awarded as follows: For physical science and and chemistry, by the Swedish Academy of Sciences; for works in physiology or medicine, by the Carolin Institute of Stockholm; for literature, by the Academy of Stockholm; finally, for the work of peace, by a committee of five members, elected by the Norwegian Storting. It is my expressed will that nationality shall not be considered, so that the prize may accrue to the most worthy, whether he be a Scandinavian or not.\"\nEach of the annual prizes established by the Will will be awarded at least once in the course of every period of five years, commencing with the year immediately following that in which the Nobel endowment enters on its functions, and the sum total of a prize thus awarded will in no case be less than 60 per cent. of the part of the yearly revenues disposable for the distribution of the prizes; neither can it be divided into more than three prizes at the most.\n\nThe first distribution of prizes for all sections will take place, if possible, in 1901. From the endowment resources will be deducted: First, a sum of 300,000 crowns (16,000l.) for each section\u2014that is, 1,500,000 crowns (80,400l.) in all\u2014which, with the interest commencing from January 1, 1900, will be used to cover, in proportion, the expenses of the organisation of the Nobel institutes in addition to the sum the board of administration shall judge necessary for the acquisition of a special site destined for the administration of the endowment and including a hall for its meetings.\n\nThe right of presenting proposals for prizes belongs to\u2014\n\n(1). Native and foreign members of the Royal Academy of Sciences. (2) Members of the Nobel committees for natural philosophy and chemistry. (3) Professors who have received the Nobel prize of the Academy of Science. (4) Ordinary and extraordinary professors of natural sciences and chemistry in the Universities of Upsala, Lund, Christiania, Copenhagen and Helsingfors, in the Carolin Institute of Medicine and Surgery, the Superior Technical Royal School, as well as to the professors of the same sciences in the Stockholm High School. (5) Incumbents of corresponding chairs of at least six universities or high schools, which the Academy of Science will select, taking care to divide them suitably between the different countries and their universities. (6) Learned men, to whom the Academy shall judge proper to send an invitation to this effect.\n\nThe invitations will be sent every year in the month of September. Proposals for the prize must be made before February 1 of the following year. They will be classified by the Nobel committee and submitted to the college of professors. The Nobel committee will decide which of the works presented shall be submitted to a special examination. The college of professors will pronounce definitely on the distribution of the prize in the course of the month of October. The vote will be taken in secret; if necessary, the question may be decided by drawing lots.\n\nThe right to present candidates for the Nobel prize belongs to the members of the Swedish Academy, the French Academy, and the Spanish Academy, which resemble the Swedish Academy in their\norganisation and aim; to the members of the literary departments of other academies, as well as to the members of literary institutions and societies analogous to academies; to professors of aesthetics, of literature and of history in the universities. This order must be published at least every five years.\n\nThe proposal to alter the status of the Society of which intimation had already been given by circular to all resident members in accordance with Rule 64 A., was brought up for discussion previous to further circulation under Rule 64(e).\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. Note on 'Abdul Qadir Badayuni's place of burial.\u2014By H. Beveridge, Esq.\n\nMr. Blochmann in his valuable paper on Bad\u0101oni and his works (J.A.S.B., Vol. XXXVIII, Part I, p. 144) says \"Mr. Harrison (of the Barqilly College) informs me that a gentleman in Bad\u0101on has been at some pains to discover among the numerous and decaying tombs of 'At\u0101pur' the grave which encloses the remains of 'Abdul Qadir, but that his efforts have not been successful. It would be anything but antiquarian sentimentality to renew the search for the resting place of a man who has left us not exactly the fullest, yet the most original and independent history of the great Emperor.\"\n\nThis was published in 1869, and I am happy to be able to inform the Society that Badayuni's grave is still extant, and that it was pointed out to me on the 12th December, 1899, by Q\u0101zi 'Ali Ahmad Mahm\u016bd Ull\u0101h Sh\u0101h, a resident of Badaun and a gentleman who is interested in historical studies.\u00b9\n\nThe grave lies in a field about two miles east of the town of Badaun and on the left hand side of the road leading to Sh\u0101hjah\u0101npur. There are at least six tombs there, and none has any name or date, but tradition identifies one of them as Badayuni's. The others are those of members of his family. They are in a small patch of waste land, raised above the level of the rest of the field, and covered with clumps of the long grass (elephant-grass?) from which M\u00fcnj-Matting is made. The village of 'At\u0101pur,' where Badayuni is said to have been buried, has ceased to be inhabited or to be remembered, and the field is reckoned\n\n\u00b9 It is Tufail Ahmed a brother of this gentleman and a pleader of the Badaun Court, who has repaired the Chief Mosque of Badaun.\nas included in the village of Mujhia. It seems desirable that steps should be taken to preserve the graves and also to mark the one which is Badayuni's.\n\nAt p. 134 Mr. Blochmann says that it was the transfer of Badayuni's grant of land from Bisawar to Badaun which has procured for him the name of Badayuni. But the local account is that Badaun was the home of his ancestors, though he himself was born at Tunda near Bisawar on the road from Agra to Ajmir. The quarter of the town of Badaun where his ancestors lived is still pointed out.\n\nThere is an excellent account of Badayuni in Maulvi Muhammad Husain Shams-al-Ulam\u0101's Darb\u0101r-i-Akbari (Lahore 1898), and at p. 461 of it there is a reference to the grave. The author there quoted under the takhallus of Khushg\u014d is, I presume, the Rai Bakh\u1e6d\u0101war Singh whose Chronicles of Badaun were published at Bareilly in 1868. Muhammad Husain adds that Badayuni is said to have left a daughter whose descendants still live in Khasiasbad in Oude.\n\nIt will be observed that I have written the name, Badayuni. This is in accordance with the Gazetteer of the N.W. Provinces, and the Darb\u0101r-i-Akbari, and also with the pronunciation of some native gentlemen. Others seem to pronounce it Badauni, i.e., with the u short. But the town is always spelt Badaun, and the o of Badaoni seems wrong, unless merely intended to prevent the a being pronounced as a diphthong. See however Mr. Blochmann's Note on the point.\n\n2. Abul Fazl's account of the Sarkar Multan in the third book of the Ain-i-Akbari.\u2014By E. D. MacLagan, Esq., I.C.S.\n\nThe field seems to be known to the villagers as the \"Field of the Vizier\" but is called by Q\u0101si Ahmed the Milkiyat and the Nirkh\u012bya\u1e47 ki Khet.\n## INDEX\n\nTO\n\nPROCEEDINGS, ASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL,\n\nFOR 1900.\n\n| Page | Page |\n|------|------|\n| Abdul Karim (Maulvie) ... 87 | Bhakta (Krishna Gopal) ... 68 |\n| 'Abdul Qadir Badayuni's place of burial ... 110 | Bhattacharyya (Charu Chandra) ... 108 |\n| Abdul Wali (Maulvie) ... 83 | Bibliotheca Indica ... 18 |\n| Abstract of Proceedings of Council during 1899 ... 16 | Bingham (Col.

Alcock, I.M.S., The Hon. Mr. E. N. Baker, Mr. J. Bathgate, Dr. T. Bloch, Rai Chunilal Bose Bahadur, Babu Nagendra-nath Bose, Mr. B. Chaudhuri, Mr. J. Eliot, F.R.S., Mr. A. U. Fanshawe, Mr. C. L. Griesbach, C.I.E., Surgeon-General R. Harvey, Mr. E. B. Havell, Col. T. H. Hendley, C.I.E., Mr. S. C. Hill, Mr. T. H. Holland, Mr. D. Hooper, Dr. A. von Krafft, Mr. G. W. K\u00fcchler, Mr. W. A. Lee, Mr. L. de Nic\u00e9ville, Mr. J. D. Nimmo, Mr. F. E. Pargiter, Mr. A. Pedler, F.R.S., Captain L. Rogers, I.M.S., Mr. C. Saunder, Mr. I. G. Schwaiger, Mr. M. J. Seth, Mahamahopadhyaya Haraprasad Shastri, Pandit Yogeshchandra Shastri.\n\nVisitors:\u2014Babu Bhubanmohan Chatterjee, Babu Nandalall Chatterjee, Mr. E. C. Cotes.\n\nThe President in an opening address expressed on behalf of the Society the feeling of sorrow with which they had learned of the death of Her Majesty the Queen. His Honor briefly reviewed the work of the past year, and then called upon the General Secretary to read the Annual Report.\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1900.\n\nThe Council of the Society have the honor to submit the following Report on the state of the Society's affairs during the year ending 31st December, 1900. As regards the work accomplished during the year, time only will permit of judgment; but with regard to the two essential conditions in the life of every association, namely, membership and finances, the Society is to be congratulated on a state of affairs more satisfactory than has been the privilege of Council to report for very many years.\n\nMember List.\n\nOur number of Ordinary Members now stands at 311, which is higher than in any year since 1887.\n\n44 Ordinary Members have been elected, but we have at the same time lost 34, namely, 9 by withdrawal, 5 by death, 4 by removal under Rule 9, 14 by removal under Rule 38 and 2 by removal under Rule 40. At the close of the year there were also 7 gentlemen's names before the Society as candidates for membership. According to the operation of Rule 5 it sometimes takes nearly two full months between the date of application and the election of a member, which is sometimes an inconvenient amount of delay. As the main loss has been due to the removal of names of members who have been in arrears for some years, the actual change of membership is more satisfactory than appears in the tabular comparison of the last with the previous six years.\n\nThe following table gives the statistics for the last six years:\n\n| Year | Paying | Non-Paying | Grand Total |\n|------|--------|------------|-------------|\n|      | Resident | Non-Resident | Foreign | Total | Life | Absent | Special Non-Subscribing | Total |\n| 1895 | 108     | 122        | 12       | 242   | 23   | 31     | 1               | 55    | 297 |\n| 1896 | 106     | 119        | 11       | 285   | 23   | 35     | 1               | 59    | 294 |\n| 1897 | 106     | 115        | 9        | 230   | 22   | 35     | 1               | 58    | 288 |\n| 1898 | 122     | 108        | 11       | 241   | 23   | 35     | 1               | 59    | 300 |\n| 1899 | 120     | 119        | 13       | 252   | 21   | 27     | 1               | 49    | 301 |\n| 1900 | 116     | 124        | 18       | 258   | 22   | 30     | 1               | 53    | 311 |\nThe names of the Ordinary Members whose death we regret are, Dr. John Anderson, F.R.S., Babu Aghore Chandra Bhaduri, H.R.H. The Duke of Edinburgh, Babu Rajani Kanta Gupta and Babu Guru Prasad Sen.\n\nWe have to lament also the death of a very distinguished Honorary Member, Professor The Right Hon. F. Max M\u00fcller.\n\nThe lists of Special Honorary Centenary Members, Corresponding Members and Associate Members continue unaltered from last year, their numbers standing at 4, 1 and 12 respectively.\n\nDuring the year two members, Sayid Ali Bilgrani, A.R.S.M., LL.B., F.G.S., and Mr. J. W. A. Grieve compounded for their future subscriptions.\n\nIndian Museum.\n\nMr. R. D. Oldham ceased to be a Trustee under section 3, clause 5, of the Indian Museum Act IV of 1887 and was succeeded by Mr. T. H. Holland. The other Trustees who represent the Society are Mr. A. Pedler, F.R.S., Dr. Mahendralal Sircar, C.I.E., Mr. G. W. K\u00fcchler, M.A., and The Most Revd. Archbishop P. Goethals, S.J.\n\nFinance.\n\nThe Accounts of the Society are shown in Statement No. 1 in the appendix under the usual heads.\n\nStatement No. 8 contains the Balance Sheet of the Society and of the different Funds administered through it.\n\nThe Budget Estimate for 1900 was taken at the following figures:\u2014Receipts Rs. 16,730-0-0; Expenditure 16,078-0-0. The actual results were found to be:\u2014Receipts Rs. 20,530-5-3; Expenditure Rs. 12,790-7-10.\n\nThe receipts thus show an excess of Rs. 3,800-5-3, while the expenditure shows a saving of Rs. 3,287-8-3 on the Budget Estimate. In addition to this an unusually large sum, Rs. 1,700, has been added to the Reserve Fund on account of the exceptional number of entrance fees paid during the year.\n\nThere is an increase in Receipts under the heads of Subscriptions, Sale of Publications and Government Allowances. Subscriptions were estimated at Rs. 7,000 while the actuals were Rs. 8,852-1-6, the excess being due to some of the arrear subscriptions from members having been realized. Owing partly to the sale of the Society's Journal, Part I, Extra No. 2 of 1899 (Dr. M. A. Stein's Memoir on Maps illustrating the Ancient Geography of Kashmir) Sale of Publications shows an increase of Rs. 237-15-6. During the year, two years' contribution by the\nAssam Government towards our Anthropological publications were received, and there is thus an increase of Rs. 2,000.\n\nOn the Expenditure side the items of Lighting, Municipal Taxes, Meetings, Books, Journal Part II and Printing Circulars, show an excess. Owing to the settlement of some old outstanding gas-bills Lighting shows an increase of Rs. 15. Municipal Taxes were estimated at Rs. 846, while the actuals have been Rs. 884-4. This was due to the increased valuation of the Society's premises and the increased assessment. Charges for Meetings show a slight excess of Rs. 6-13 due to advertisement charges for the Simla Meeting. Owing to the adjustment of certain old bills from Messrs. R. Friedl\u00e4nder & Sohn, for supplying publications to the Society the account for new Books shows a slight increase of Rs. 35-2-2. Journal, Part II, has exceeded the budget by Rs. 172-7. This is due to the payment of printing charges for certain numbers of 1899. During the last year a number of circulars were printed in connection with the proposed reorganization of the Society and thus there is an excess of expenditure of Rs. 86-6 under the head Printing Circulars.\n\nThere were three extraordinary items of expenditure during 1900, under the heads of Furniture, Royal Society's Catalogue and Catalogue of Coins not provided for in the Budget. Rs. 265-10 was spent in cleaning and renovating certain pictures belonging to the Society, and the cost of a platform for the Society's Meetings. The expenditure on the Royal Society's Catalogue has been Rs. 382-13. The balance of Rs. 362-8 for cataloguing the Society's coins by the late Mr. C. J. Rodgers was paid to Mrs. Rodgers. Out of Rs. 1,000 budgetted for the Society's Library Catalogue, Rs. 100 has been paid to Mr. H. B. Perie, the compiler, on account. Owing to extra work involved, it may be necessary to enhance the compiler's remuneration to possibly Rs. 1,300, and the balance, Rs. 1,200, has consequently been budgetted for as an extraordinary expenditure. Besides, Rs. 6,000 has been budgetted for Repairs to the Society's premises under the same head. To meet this expenditure permission has been given to draw Rs. 10,000 from the Reserve Fund; but the savings of the past year will to a great extent meet this call without trespassing on the Reserve Fund.\n\nThe Budget Estimate of probable ordinary Receipts and Expenditure for 1901 has been fixed as follows:\u2014Receipts Rs. 17,430; Expenditure Rs. 16,126-4. On the receipt side Government Allowances have been increased by Rs. 1,000, being contribution due from the Assam Government for our Anthropological publications. The item Miscellaneous receipts is based upon the actuals of the last year.\n\nOn the expenditure side, the estimate under the head of Salaries\nhas been increased by Rs. 363-7 owing to certain increments sanctioned to the office staff. Municipal Taxes and Meetings have also been slightly increased. A sum of Rs. 15 has been allotted for Registration fee for 1900 and 1901, covering the fee for filing a copy of the Society's revised rules.\n\n### BUDGET ESTIMATE FOR 1901.\n\n#### Receipts.\n\n| Item                  | Estimate | Actuals | Estimate |\n|-----------------------|----------|---------|----------|\n| Subscriptions         | Rs. 7,000 | 8,852   | 7,000    |\n| Sale of Publications  | 600      | 837     | 600      |\n| Interest on Investments| 5,500    | 5,530   | 5,530    |\n| Rent of Rooms         | 1,200    | 1,200   | 1,200    |\n| Government Allowances  | 2,000    | 4,000   | 3,000    |\n| Miscellaneous          | 400      | 110     | 100      |\n| **Total Rs.**          | 16,730   | 20,530  | 17,430   |\n\n#### Expenditure.\n\n| Item                  | Estimate | Actuals | Estimate |\n|-----------------------|----------|---------|----------|\n| Salaries              | Rs. 3,600 | 3,436   | 3,800    |\n| Commission            | 425      | 416     | 425      |\n| Pension               | 52       | .52     | 52       |\n| Stationery            | 120      | 113     | 120      |\n| Lighting              | 60       | 75      | 60       |\n| Municipal Taxes       | 846      | 884     | 884      |\n| Postage               | 550      | 445     | 550      |\n| Freight               | 70       | 32      | 60       |\n| Meetings              | 50       | 56      | 60       |\n| Contingencies         | 300      | 295     | 300      |\n| Books                 | 1,500    | 1,535   | 1,500    |\n| Binding               | 750      | 495     | 750      |\n| Journal, Part I.      | 2,100    | 346     | 2,100    |\n| \u201d, II.                | 2,100    | 2,272   | 2,100    |\n| \u201d, III.               | 2,000    | 1,275   | 2,000    |\n| Proceedings           | 1,000    | 652     | 1,000    |\n| Printing Circulars, &c.| 200      | 236     | 200      |\n| Registration Fee      | 5        | ....... | 15       |\n| Auditors' Fee         | 100      | 100     | 100      |\n| Petty Repairs         | 250      | 69      | 50       |\n| **Total Rs.**          | 16,078   | 12,790  | 16,126   |\nExtraordinary Expenditure.\n\n| Item                        | Amount |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| Library Catalogue           | Rs. 1,000 0 0 |\n| Repairs                     | ....... |\n| Furniture                   | ....... |\n| Royal Society's Catalogue   | ....... |\n| Catalogue of Coins          | ....... |\n| **Total Rs.**               | **Rs. 1,000 0 0**\n\nAgencies.\n\nOur London Agency is still in the hands of Messrs.

The value of the publications sent to them during the year amounts to \u00a324 representing 300 numbers of the Journal and Proceedings and Rs. 350-14 representing 503 components of the Bibliotheca Indica. From them we have received books and papers of the value of \u00a339-19-2.\n\nOur Continental Agent is Mr. Otto Harrassowitz to whom we have sent publications valued at \u00a327-14 and Rs. 282-6 of which \u00a318-10-10 and Rs. 149-11-10 have been recovered by sales.\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe total number of volumes or parts of volumes added to the Library during the year was 2,328, of which 705 were purchased and 1,623 presented or received in exchange for the Society's publications.\n\nIn consequence of enquiries made by the Government of Bengal, the General Secretary examined the records of the Society for the purpose of ascertaining the exact terms under which the valuable collection of manuscripts and books were transferred to the Society on the break-up of the Fort William College Library in 1836. As it required some considerable time to trace the history of the transaction, it will probably be of use to the members to record briefly a summary of the facts so far as obtainable:\u2014The Asiatic Society having learnt that it was the intention of Government to transfer the major part of the Library of the College of Fort William to the Curators of the Calcutta Public Library, wrote to Government on the 8th (6th) of February, 1836, offering accommodation for the remainder, namely, the oriental works in the Fort William College Library; and, on condition that Government gave assistance towards the staff necessary to keep the collection in order, agreed (1) to provide for the accessibility of the books to students whether or not members of the Society, and (2) to\nrecognize the Government's proprietary right to the volumes in question.\n\nOn the 24th February, 1836, Mr. Secretary H. T. Prinsep wrote to the Society to state \"that the Governor of Bengal accepts the offer of 'the Asiatic Society to provide rooms for the accommodation of, and 'to hold accessible to the public, the oriental portion of the late 'Library of the College of Fort William, and has ordered the books 'to be made over on the following conditions:\u2014The books are to be 'the property of the Government until the Honourable Court of Direc- 'tors shall decide whether they shall be made over absolutely or not, 'the Society to be ruled of course by their decision. The Government 'to allow the Asiatic Society a monthly sum of Rs. 78 (stated by the 'the Secretary of the College to be the minimum expense for custody 'of the books), in consideration of the Society providing for estab- 'lishment and keeping the books clean and in proper repair. All 'other charges to be provided by the Society. The above allowance to 'cease, in case of the property in the books being made over to the 'Society.\"\n\nArrangements were consequently made for the reception of the books by this Society, and our Secretary was requested to take measures for receiving the books and granting receipts for the same in the course of their daily transfer, which took place during the month of March, 1836. On the 6th of April the Secretary of the Society announced that he had received 1,130 Sanskrit and 2,676 Arabic and Persian volumes from the Fort William College; but the only catalogue then in existence was that which had been prepared by the College officers, and which, having been checked by the Secretary of the Society, was returned to Captain Ouselay, Secretary to the College of Fort William, with a covering letter, dated 18th April, 1836. The Secretary of Government was informed of this transaction in a letter from the Secretary of the Society, dated 4th June, 1836, which was acknowledged by Government letter No. 836 of the 15th June, 1836.\n\nSubsequently the Court of Directors, through the Government, requested the Society to send them the duplicates of the manuscript works which were previously in the possession of the Society, and the Secretary of the Society consequently selected and packed, for transmission to the Court of Directors, the duplicates of the Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian manuscripts transferred from the College Library. The Secretary of the Society in advising the despatch of the three cases of these manuscripts in a letter to the Secretary, Government of India, dated 7th April, 1837, transmitted also a catalogue of the duplicate manuscripts pointing out at the same time that the general catalogue of late\nCollege Library was already in the possession of Government. In 1838 complete catalogues of the manuscripts in the Society's Library were prepared and printed, but they included the works previously in the possession of the Society as well as those obtained from the College of Fort William, and no mark was made in these catalogues to distinguish the former from the latter collection.\n\nThe whole of the above transactions had reference to the transfer of manuscript books from the College to this Society. But at about the same time the Society, having learnt that a number of printed oriental books had been transferred from the College Library to the Calcutta Public Library, approached the Curators of the latter institution for the purpose of securing the transfer of such printed books to this Society, and the transfer having received the sanction of Government, the books, to the number of about 300, were transferred; and the list of them forwarded by the Deputy Librarian of the Public Library having been checked, signed and receipted by the Secretary, was returned to the Curators of the Public Library with a covering letter dated 27th July, 1836. These books were received by the Asiatic Society on terms precisely similar to those already agreed to in connection with the manuscript works, and the Society continued to receive the Government grant of Rs. 78 per month until August, 1846, when the Court of Directors approved of the transfer of the whole collection of books to the Asiatic Society and the monthly grant of 78 Rupees, allowed by Government for the custody of the books, was withdrawn. The books and manuscripts have ever since been maintained in order at the expense of our members.\n\nThe compilation of a new edition of the Society's Library Catalogue having been completed, the Council referred the manuscript to a Sub-Committee composed of Major A. Alcock, Dr. T. Bloch, Mah\u0101mahop\u0101dhy\u0101ya Haraprasad Shastri, Mr. S. C. Hill and Mr. T. H. Holland to make a detailed inspection of the work before printing. The Sub-Committee has not yet completed its task.\n\nOn the recommendation of the two Philological Secretaries, Babu Charu Chandra Bhattacharya was appointed Pandit for the Oriental Library in the place of late Pandit Annada Prasad Sarasvati, deceased.\n\nProposed Reorganisation of the Society.\n\nAt the instance of Col. T. H. Hendley, I.M.S., C.I.E., the following five proposals were laid before the Council Meeting of March 28th.\n\n1. That two of the monthly meetings of the Society, viz., on the\nfirst Wednesdays in September and October (on which days no meetings are held in Calcutta) should be held in Simla.\n\n2. That these meetings should for the present be ordinarily devoted to the reading of papers, the general business of the Society being conducted as usual in Calcutta.\n\n3. That Rule 1 of the Society, which shows that almost all branches of knowledge relating to the Eastern Hemisphere were included in its original operations, should be interpreted in its widest sense, and that papers and discussions should therefore be welcomed on such subjects as Indian Art, Forestry, Horticulture, &c., which have lately been either ignored or have been dealt with elsewhere.\n\n4. That in order to make the Journals more popular and interesting to the general public, they should appear regularly and contain extracts from, and abridgments of, current literature.\n\n5. That if these suggestions are approved they should be brought before the next monthly meeting of the Society and a Sub-Committee be then appointed to give practical effect to them.\n\nThe first two proposals were carried, but the discussion on the rest opened wider questions, and the following Committee was appointed to consider them:\u2014Col. T. H. Hendley, C.I.E., I.M.S., A. Pedler, Esq., F.R.S., F. E. Pargiter, Esq., I.C.S., T. H. Holland, Esq., F.G.S., with subsequent addition of Major A. Alcock, I.M.S., L. de Nic\u00e9ville, Esq., and Mah\u0101mahop\u0101dhy\u0101ya Haraprasad Shastri. As a result of the deliberations of this Committee and subsequent discussion in Council, it was decided to submit a scheme for the reorganization of the Society to the general body of Ordinary Members. The scheme, outlined by 9 definite proposals, was discussed at the General Meeting of the 5th December, and afterwards circulated in the usual way to the members, whose votes will be counted at the Annual General Meeting to be held in February next.\n\nRepair of Premises.\n\nAt the request of the Council, Mr. E. Thornton kindly made a survey of the Society's premises and submitted a report to Council. The Council having agreed with Mr. Thornton as to the necessity of immediate repairs, appointed a Sub-Committee consisting of Major A. Alcock, Mr. C. L. Griesbach, Mr. E. Thornton, Mr. W. K. Dods and Mr. T. H. Holland to determine the details more urgently necessary, and to discuss the question of establishing a permanent Repairs Fund for future contingencies. The Committee having submitted a report the Council laid the question before a General Meeting and at the same time requested permission to withdraw Rs. 10,000 from the Permanent Reserve.\nFund for present repairs and for the purpose of starting the proposed \"Repairs Fund.\" The proposal was submitted to the whole body of ordinary members under rules 64(c), 64A and 65 and the votes recorded were 111 \"for\" and 1 \"against\" the proposals. Messrs. Martin & Co. submitted an estimate for repairing the Society's premises, which was accepted as revised by the Repairs Committee, Rs. 6,000 being assigned, and the work, which was taken up at once, has now made considerable progress.\n\nOn account of the marked improvement made in the financial position of the Society during the past year, the Council thinks the scheme for a Repairs Fund can this year be definitely shaped, and that we shall be in a position to devote the amount, Rs. 1,200, now received annually as rent for rooms leased to the Photographic Society, towards keeping the premises in an efficient state of repair. The Council takes this opportunity of thanking Mr. Thornton for his assistance and advice.\n\nOn a report of an inspection of the Society's pictures kindly made by Mr. E. B. Havell, and the Honorary General Secretary, Council ordered the picture of a \"Ghat at Benares\" and the portraits of D. J. Patterson, F. Stoliczka and Dwarkanath Tagore to be repaired and varnished at a cost of Rs. 97.\n\nExchange of Publications.\n\nDuring the last year, the Council accepted four applications for exchange of publications with other Societies, viz., (1) from the Naturhistorische Gesellschaft, N\u00fcrnberg, the Society's Journal, Parts II and III, being exchanged for their Abhandlungen, (2) from the Illinois State Laboratory of Natural History, the Society's Journal, Part II, and Proceedings being exchanged for its Bulletin, (3) from the Berliner Entomologischer Verein, the Society's Journal, Part II, being exchanged for their Journal, (4) from the Seminar f\u00fcr Orientalische Sprachen, Berlin, the Society's Journal, Part I, and Proceedings being exchanged for its Mittheilungen.\n\nSecretaries and Treasurer.\n\nThere were two changes among the officers of the Society. Mr. F. Finn resigned the office of Natural History Secretary in February and Mr. L. de Nic\u00e9ville was appointed. Lieut.-Col. L. A. Waddell requested to be relieved of the duties of Anthropological Secretary on his transfer from Calcutta, and Mr. F. E. Pargiter, I.C.S., kindly consented to undertake the work of editing Journal, Part III. The\nunavoidable interruption in the publication, of this part of the Journal will, it is hoped, not be repeated in future, and the Editor has now in the press a series of papers which it is anticipated will fulfil our obligations to the Local Governments which have generously guaranteed a grant for publishing papers on Anthropology.\n\nThe duties of the Philological Secretary have been shared during the year by Dr. T. Bloch, in charge of Journal, Part I, and the Coins, and Mahamahopadhyaya Haraprasad Shastri in charge of the Bibliotheca Indica and the work of collecting Sanskrit and Vernacular Manuscripts.\n\nThe office of General Secretary has been held throughout the year by Mr. T. H. Holland, whilst the Society is indebted to Mr. W. K. Dods for continuing the duties of Treasurer during the period under report.\n\nPublications.\n\nThere were published during the year ten numbers of the Proceedings (Nos. 10 & 11 of 1899 and Nos. 1-10 of 1900), containing 160 pages of letter-press; one number of the Journal, Part I (No. 1 of 1900), containing 92 pages of letter-press; four numbers of the Journal, Part II (No. 4 of 1899 and Nos. 1-3 of 1900), containing 580 pages of letter-press and a plate of 1898. There were also published a catalogue of the Society's Sanskrit books and MSS., Part II, and the Index to Journal, Part II for 1899.\n\nJournal, Part I.\n\nOf the first part of the Society's Journal only two numbers have been published during the past year, each of about a hundred pages. Of these, No. 1 was issued in August last, and No. 2 is just being printed off and will shortly be published.\n\nIt is in keeping with the traditions of our Society that of the papers published during the last year, not less than five deal with inscriptions. Of these inscriptions, three are published for the first time, while the remaining two are second and improved editions of documents already known. The first paper to be noticed is an edition by Babu Nagendranatha Vasu of a new copper-plate inscription of Madanap\u0101la the original of which was presented to our Society by Mr. N. K. Bose, C.S., and exhibited to the Society at its Annual Meeting in 1899. The plate was found in the Dinajpur District, the old stronghold of the P\u0101la Kings of Bihar and Western Bengal. It gives us a long list of kings belonging to this dynasty, not less than seventeen, down to Madanap\u0101la, who must have lived somewhere near the beginning of the 12th century A.D. It was a happy coincidence that some of the names of these kings, all previously unknown to us, were\nfound at the same time in an interesting literary work, the discovery of which is due to Mahamahopadhyaya Haraprasad Shastri. This work is called R\u0101macaritam and is a poem of double meaning, each verse being applicable both to the history of the mythical hero R\u0101ma and also to the historical kings R\u0101map\u0101la and his predecessors. Its value lies in this that it is the first historical poem found in Eastern India, being of the same class as the biography of Har\u1e63a of Kanauj by Bana, the history of the Param\u0101ra king Navas\u0101hasanaka of Malwa, and the poem written by Bilha\u1e47a, a Kashmiri pandit, in honour of the C\u0101lukya king Vikram\u0101ditya, all of which come from the West. It is hoped that the learned discoverer will soon find leisure to publish this most valuable find of his.\n\nThe copper-plate of Madanap\u0101la which has just been referred to is interesting also from a sociological point of view. We know that all the P\u0101la Kings were followers of the Buddhist religion and that it was during their reign that Buddhism flourished for the last time in India. Now, the grant recorded in the plate was made by Madanap\u0101la to a Brahman as a dakshin\u0101 or honorarium for having read the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata to the queens of the king's harem. This is one more fact, in addition to others previously known, showing the intimate connexion that existed in the time of those Buddhist kings between Buddhism and Hinduism, a connexion that resulted in the former losing more and more its ground against the latter, and that thus prepared the way for the final destruction of Buddhism by the Muhammada invaders.\n\nDuring the last decades of the reigns of the P\u0101la kings, there rose to power in Bengal another family of Hindu princes who came from the South and were K\u1e63atriyas of the Lunar race, the Sena kings. Of them Lak\u1e63manasena, the great friend of poets, still lives in the memory of the people. Of him, too, a new copper-plate inscription was published in the Journal of last year by Babu Akshay Kumar Mitra. It is interesting as a document coming from this famous king, but does not add much new information to what we already know with regard to his period and history. The third inscription belongs to a king Jayaditya who lived in the 9th century A.D. Its discovery is due to Dr. Hoey; and it has been published by Dr. Bloch in an Appendix to a paper by Dr. Hoey, which is referred to below. The plate was found in the Gorakhpur District, and to the north of this district we have to look for the dominion of this king, as in an inscription of his father\u2014the only other document of this dynasty known to us\u2014his capital, Vijayanagara, is described as situated on the slopes of the Himalayas. As with other dynasties of Indian kings, scarcely more than the names of the kings of this dynasty are known to\nus, and we must await further discoveries before we can say anything with regard to their history, the extent of their dominions, and their relations with other contemporary rulers.\n\nWith regard to these matters the case stands much better in Orissa. There from the time of the conquest of that country by the Ga\u1e45ga kings, who came from the south, history begins to dawn, and a complete series of historical data is known to us both from inscriptions and other sources. Babu Mano Mohan Chakravartti, who, having been stationed in Orissa for some years, has made this part of Indian history his special study, has again in the Journal of last year contributed a new and valuable addition to our knowledge of Orissan history in a paper in which he publishes a long inscription of Kapilendra Deva, one of the Orissa kings\u2014by the way, the earliest known specimen of writing in modern Oriya character\u2014and in which he deals with the chronology of the last rulers of that country up to Mukunda Deva who was overthrown by Kalapahar, the general of the Afghan king Sulaiman. The same learned author, when stationed at Gaya, took the opportunity to procure a good copy of an inscription at the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Dv\u0101rak\u0101 temple there, and has contributed his reading and translation of the same to our Journal. The inscription refers itself to the time of Nayap\u0101la, one of the predecessors of Madanap\u0101la who is referred to above. It has now been read completely, while previous editors were able to decipher only portions of it.\n\nMore general questions touching on Epigraphy and Palaeography are dealt with in a paper by Dr. Hoernle which was read before the Society as long ago as 1898. Dr. Hoernle has made a searching inquiry into the various writing materials used in India, vis., Palm-leaf, Birch-bark, and Paper, and it led him to certain conclusions as to the localities and times in which these materials were in use. From this he proceeds further. It is now generally accepted that the ancient Indian alphabet, as we find it first in the inscriptions of A\u015boka, was borrowed from the Phoenicians. The date fixed for this is approximately the 8th century B.C. Now, as certain changes, which the Phoenician letters had to undergo when taken over by the Indians, are best explained if we suppose that they were adapted to a writing material such as palm-leaf, and, moreover, as we know the palm-tree, the leaves of which were used for writing purposes, is indigenous in Southern India, Dr. Hoernle concludes that it was the South, and not the North, of India, where the Phoenician alphabet first came into use. There certainly existed an ancient trade through the Arabian Sea between Phoenicia and Southern India, witnesses of which are some words of Dravidian origin that crept into the ancient languages of Western Asia.\nat an early date, and Dr. Hoerlile's theory is in keeping with this fact and contributes to it some additional strength.\n\nThe paper by Dr. Hoey mentioned above takes us into another department, the ancient Geography of India. Dr. Hoey tries to fix the sites of some places famous to us from Buddha's history, especially Vesali and the place where Buddha entered Nirvana, Kusinara. He believes he has found those sites in the modern districts of Champaran and Saran. The latter place, Kusinara, he identifies with a locality now called Sewan in the Saran District. This would lead us much further south than where Kusinara is now generally searched for. After the identification of the true site of Buddha's birthplace, Kapilavastu, by the help of the Asoka pillar discovered in 1896 near Paderia in the Nepalese Terai, it is now generally believed, on the strength of the directions given in the Chinese itineraries, that Kusinara will be found in the Terai somewhere to the north of the modern district of Champaran, but we must await further discoveries before the point can be definitely settled, and we have to thank Dr. Hoey, who has rendered many valuable services to Indian Archaeology, for having given the discussion a new start.\n\nOf the last four papers to be mentioned two are devoted to the later Muhammadan period of Indian History, while the other two deal with the non-Aryan languages of India. The first is by Mr. Irvine, the great authority on the history of the later Mughal Emperors. It is an edition and translation of a Hindi poem composed by a Brahman of Allahabad, by name Sridhar Muridhar, describing the struggle between Farrukhsiyar and the other pretenders to the Mughal throne that ended in the success of the former. Mr. Beveridge has contributed a short note on the tomb of Badaoni, the famous historian of Akbar, which he was successful in discovering when he visited Badoni in December 1899. The tomb was pointed out to him near the village of Atapur, but it is a plain tomb, without any inscription, and only tradition still preserves the memory of it.\n\nTo the knowledge of the non-Aryan languages of India, the Revd. H. Francke, a Moravian Missionary at Leh in Ladakh, has contributed an interesting collection of Tibetan proverbs obtained by him in Ladakh, which are of value, not only to the student of folk-lore, but also to the linguist, being, specimens of a little known dialect of the Tibetan language. Lastly, mention should be made of a paper contributed by the Revd. F. Hahn, a German Lutheran Missionary at Lohardagga, on the language of the Asurs. They are a small aboriginal tribe in Chutia Nagpur, consisting of not more than 2,500 persons, and speaking a language of their own. He has also contributed, in\nthe introduction to his paper, an interesting note on their social habits and religious beliefs.\n\nJournal, Part II.\n\nFour parts containing over 500 pages of the Journal, Vol. lxix, Part II, which is devoted to Natural Science, were issued during the current year. They comprise nineteen papers, and fully sustain the high scientific value of the Journal of the Society.\n\nThe first paper of 87 pages is No. 11 of Sir George King's \"Materials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula,\" and contains an account of the order Melastomaceae. One genus, Sonerila, has been written by Dr. O. Stapf, First Assistant in the Royal Herbarium, Kew. The sub-orders Melastomeae, Astronieae and Memecyleae are characterised. No new genera, but 61 new species and 11 new varieties are described. All the previously described species in the orders are re-described by Messrs. King and Stapf, the paper thus forming a complete monograph of the order.\n\nWith No. 2 was issued a coloured plate of certain larvae and pupae of butterflies, from the Ke Archipelago, to illustrate Mr. de Nic\u00e9ville's paper on the butterflies of those islands published in Vol. lxvii, Part II, of the Journal for 1898.\n\nThe second paper by Mr. W. P. Masson deals with four rare mammals occurring in the neighbourhood of Darjeeling.\n\nThe third paper is by Babu Promothonath Dutt, and is entitled \"On a new method of treating the properties of the circle and analogous matters,\" and is illustrated by five woodcuts in the text.\n\nThe fourth paper is a \"Note on a method of detecting free Phosphorus\" by Professor P. Makerji, who gives an account of the apparatus used and the method of carrying out the test.\n\nIn the fifth paper Captain H. J. Walton, I.M.S., records the occurrence of the Desert Rose-Finch (Rhodospiza obsoleta, Licht.) in the Tochi Valley, which is the first record of the occurrence of this bird within the limits of the Indian empire.\n\nIn the sixth paper Col. C. T. Bingham and Mr. H. N. Thompson give a list with copious and very interesting notes of the Birds collected and observed in the Southern Shan States of Upper Burma. Three hundred and one species are catalogued. No new species are described.\n\nThe seventh paper is by Mr. F. Finn, and is devoted to redescribing the form of Cormorant inhabiting the Crozette Islands. The bird was first described by Mr. Blyth in our Journal, and the type specimen is still in the collection of the Indian Museum, Calcutta. Mr.\nFinn points out that if the species is a distinct one it will stand as *Phalacrocorax melanogenys* (Blyth).\n\nIn the next paper Mr. Finn in conjunction with Lieut. H. H. Turner gives a note on two rare Indian pheasants from the Chin Hills of Upper Burma.\n\nIn the ninth paper Mr. Finn records \"Notes on the Structure and Function of the Tracheal Bulb in male Anatidae.\" He describes the structure of the trachea in four drakes, and the sound made by both sexes of nine species of ducks.\n\nIn the tenth paper Mr. Lionel de Nic\u00e9ville records a \"Note on Calinaga, an aberrant genus of Asiatic Butterflies.\" Different structural characters are described, and notes on the geographical distribution of the five known species are added. He thinks it probable that the genus should be placed in the family Nymphalidae, and in the subfamily Danainae, near the genus Radana.\n\nThe eleventh paper is by Captain H. J. Walton, who gives copious notes on 157 species of birds collected or observed by him in Kumaon in the months of April to July.\n\nMajor D. Prain in the twelfth paper describes twelve new plants from Eastern India, and in the thirteenth gives a list of the Asiatic species of Ormosia. A key to these plants is given, also a table of distribution of the South-Eastern-Asiatic species of the genus, 22 in all.\n\nThe fourteenth paper is by Mr. Lionel de Nic\u00e9ville, and consists of a list of the known food-plants of the butterflies of the Kanara District of Southern India, and a revision of the species of butterflies there occurring. In part I, 194 species of plants are named, and the names of the butterflies which feed on them in the larval state are given under each. In part II, 245 species of butterflies known to occur in Kanara are listed, with the plants noted under each name on which their larvae feed. This is the first time such lists have ever been published out of America, and should prove of interest both to the botanist and to the entomologist. Incidentally a list of the butterflies of the family Lycaenidae is given which in the larval or pupal stages or both are attended by ants, 27 species of butterflies in all. Descriptions are also given for the first time of the transformations of many of the butterflies. Similar lists are given of a few butterflies and their food-plants from the Western Himalayas and Kashmir.\n\nIn the fifteenth paper the editor of this part of the Journal gives a note on the synonymy of the avian genus *Harpactes*, Swainson, which name, being pre-occupied, will have to fall before *Pyrotrogon*, Bonaparte, when used for birds.\n\nThe sixteenth paper of 177 pages by Major A. Alcock entitled\n\"Materials for a Carcinological Fauna of India, No. 6. The Brachyura Catometopa, or Grapsoidea.\" The paper, like its predecessors, not only contains descriptions of all the families, genera, and species of Indian Catometopa, but is also a systematic monograph of the genera of the entire group. The Catometopa are here divided into nine families, all of which are newly characterized, and among them the Palicidae, the systematic position of which has long puzzled carcinologists, are included. 136 species are described, 31 of which are new to science: they fall into 55 genera, of which 8 are new. The large number of new species is probably explained by the fact that the paper covers the large collections of the R.I.M. Survey Ship \"Investigator\"\u2014collections made for the most part in depths that lie outside the reach of ordinary collectors. By the publication of this paper the total number of species of Brachynrons Crustacea recorded for the Indian region is raised to 606, exclusive of the freshwater Telphusidae.\n\nThe seventeenth paper by Captain L. Rogers, M.D., I.M.S., is a very important one, and is entitled \"The relationship of the water-supply, water-logging, and the distribution of Anopheles Mosquitos respectively, to the prevalence of Malaria north of Calcutta.\" This paper is illustrated by a map, which unfortunately is not ready, but will be issued with a subsequent number of the Journal. The conclusions Dr. Rogers arrives at are that the quality of the water drunk by the people has chiefly to do with the prevalence of malaria in them, and that in India at any rate mosquitos by their bites or stings are not the prime cause of malaria, though they may play a part by taking the malarial parasite back from their human hosts to the water drunk by the people, but that a good water-supply is an important prophylactic measure in lessening the prevalence of malaria.\n\nDr. P. C. Ray contributes the eighteenth paper, \"Further Researches on Mercurous Nitrite and its Derivatives,\" and \"On Mercurons Iodide and a new Method of its Preparation.\" A woodcut is given of the apparatus used for the first of these experiments.\n\nThe nineteenth and last paper is by Mr. J. S. Gamble and Major D. Prain, and describes a new genus and species of plant of the Western Himalayas of the order Orobancheae, the genus being named Gleadovia after the first finder of it, Mr. F. Gleadow.\n\nJournal, Part III.\n\nThe number of papers read in the Anthropological Section during the year was three, and they were on\u2014\"The Coorgs and Yeruvas, an ethnological contrast\" by Mr. T. H. Holland, 'The Vslam\u0101 Caste in Berar' by Captain Wolseley Haig, and 'Ancient Stone implements in\nthe Santal Parganas' by Rev. P. O. Boddington. The first was read at the January meeting, and the two others at that in November.\n\nIn the first paper Mr. Holland gives details of measurements made on the two largest tribes in the province of Coorg, and compares them with previously published results for other tribes in South India. The Yeruvas, like the Kurumbas, Irulas, Paniyans and other aboriginal tribes, are thick-lipped, wavy-haired, black-skinned, platyrhine and short of stature. The Coorgs, on the contrary, stand out amongst the people of South India by reason of their comparatively fair skin, great stature (168-5 cm.), mesorhine (72-1) nose, sub-brachycephalic cranium (79-9) and in many physical characters generally presented by races of the so-called higher types. The much disputed question of Coorg caste is discussed, and, assuming the Brahmins of South India to represent the highest caste, that is, to lay claim to the purest Aryan relationship, the Author recommends the Coorgs to follow Mr. Richter's advice and despise all notions of caste.\n\nIn the second paper Captain Haig describes a caste, which is numerous in the north-eastern districts of the Madras Presidency and in the Nizam's Dominions, and has spread into Berar, and which, though agricultural now, claims a war-like ancestry.\n\nMr. Boddington narrates in his paper how he chanced to discover the existence of ancient stone implements among the Santals under the name of 'thunderbolts.' They believe that such stones fall from the sky with lightning and attribute great medicinal virtues to them. He describes with the aid of plates the stones which he has succeeded in collecting and explains their supposed virtues. His discovery is interesting in that it furnishes a ready clue towards finding similar articles elsewhere, by enquiring simply about 'thunder-bolts.'\n\nThe publication in the Anthropological or Third part of the Journal for the year 1900 will be that of one paper, Col. Waddell's 'Wild Tribes of the Brahma-putra Valley.' It was read at the November meeting in 1899, but there has been a most regrettable delay in issuing it, for, when the paper was being printed, the Author was ordered away to join the expedition to China during the middle of the year and has been absent ever since, and the publication has been greatly impeded. It is hoped, however, that he will be able to finish it soon. The paper gives a description of the tribes, their divisions, manners, customs and religious ideas, and also copious anthropometrical information; and it will be embellished with a large number of photographic illustrations.\n\nThe difficulty which has attended this paper has delayed other papers, but they will be issued early during the present year.\nCoins.\n\nDuring the last year the Society has been presented with 30 new coins. Of these, 15 are small pieces of lead, with hardly any mark on them, so that one is led to question their nature as coins. The Society possesses already a large number of similar pieces. One gold coin is a so-called *padma\u1e6dak\u0101* (because it is shaped like a lotus). It has been attributed to the K\u0101damba kings of the North-Western Dekhan and Northern Mysore, of about the 5th or 6th century A.D., but the shape of some N\u0101gar\u012b characters occurring on it leads one to put it down to a considerably later period. From Southern India also came 8 small gold coins, so-called *janams*, presented to us by Lieut.-Col. Bain. It is difficult to say to which dynasty or period they belong, and very little is known about them. Lastly, we have received 6 Muhammadan coins, viz., 1 each of Al\u0101uddin Khilji and Ghiy\u0101suddin Tughlaq and 2 of Muhammad ibn Tughlaq, all Delhi Emperors of the 13th and 14th centuries A.D., and one rupee each of the Mughal Emperors Muhammad Sh\u0101h and Sh\u0101h \u0100lam, the former being from the Surat Mint.\n\nBibliotheca Indica.\n\nTwenty fasciculi have been published during the course of the year at a cost of Rs. 8,780-4-9. Of this sum the printing charges amount to Rs. 5,380-12-9 and the editing charges to Rs. 3,399-8-0, the average cost of publishing each fasciculus being Rs. 439. Of these twenty fasciculi, one is in the Tibetan and nineteen in the Sanskrit Series; none is in the Arabic-Persian series. The following is a descriptive catalogue of the works which have been either commenced or finished during the year.\n\nWorks that have come to a close.\n\nTibetan Series.\n\nSher Phyin is a literal translation of the \u00c7atas\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101-p\u0101ramit\u0101 in Tibetan. Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 is the great work of the Mah\u0101-y\u0101na School. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, the great preacher of Mah\u0101y\u0101na, who flourished in the second century of the Christian Era is said to have brought the Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 from the nether regions. It has several recensions of various extent. One is called the Svalp\u0101ksar\u0101, a recension in a few words very recently discovered in Nep\u0101l. The second is in seven hundred \u00e7lokas known as Saptacatik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101. The third is \u0100\u1e63\u1e6das\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 in 8,000 \u00e7lokas. This has already been published in this series. The fourth is Pa\u00f1cavim\u00e7atis\u0101hasrik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101-p\u0101ramit\u0101 in 25,000 \u00e7lokas. The fifth and the largest is the \u00c7atas\u0101hasrik\u0101\nPraj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101, and of this the work published is a Tibetan translation. The work has been edited by Babu Prat\u0101pacandra Ghose, a gentleman whose connexion with the Society began in the early sixties. He has successfully brought the difficult and arduous work he had undertaken to a successful close, and the credit of editing and publishing the largest work in Tibetan belongs to him. This is perhaps the first time that a Tibetan work on Buddhism has been published in its entirety.\n\n**Sanskrit Series.**\n\n*Tattvacint\u0101ma\u1e47i,* the great work of the Amalgamated Ny\u0101ya-vai\u015be\u1e63ika School, which is the property and glory of Eastern India and which has been exercising an immense influence on the brahmanic mind for the last seven or eight centuries, has been practically completed during the year. The last fasciculus containing indices has been printed but not yet published. It is in four parts called Kha\u1e47\u1e0das, each part treating of one pram\u0101\u1e47a or method of proof. The pram\u0101\u1e47as, according to this school, are four, namely, perception, inference, analogy and testimony; and there are parts treating of each of these. The second part, that on inference, has a subdivision entitled \u012a\u015bvar\u0101num\u0101na, i.e., inference of the existence of a Creator. The work has been edited by P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dita K\u0101makhy\u0101tha Tarkav\u0101gi\u00e7a, the Professor of Hindu Philosophy in the Sanskrit College, Calcutta, on whom an appreciative Government has recently conferred the title of Mah\u0101mahop\u0101dhy\u0101ya. The work has taken about 18 years to complete.\n\n**Works that have been commenced.**\n\n**Sanskrit Series.**\n\nThe \u0100\u015batapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a was published about forty years ago by Professor Weber of Berlin, but it was without a commentary and without that system of elaborate indices without which Vedic works are of little value to scholars. It was for this reason that the Council of the Asiatic Society of Bengal accorded their permission to the publication of the work with S\u0101ya\u1e47a\u015b\u0101carya's commentary and indices to \u0100c\u0101ryya Satyavrata \u015a\u0101ma\u1e47ami who had already practically completed his edition of the Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a with a commentary and indices. The work has been taken in hand and two fasciculi have already appeared.\n\nThe \u010clokav\u0101rtika in verse and the Tantrav\u0101rtika in prose complete the great work of Kum\u0101rila on the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 School of Hindu Philosophy, which concerns itself with laying down principles and rules for the interpretation of the Vedas. This great work was written in the seventh century and was the first great polemical work which, by refuting other systems, established one system of Hindu faith. \u010cakraka\ncame after Kum\u0101rila and Udayana after him. An English translation of the \u010clokav\u0101rtika has been undertaken by Babu Gayg\u0101n\u0101tha Jh\u0101n, Librarian of the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja's Library, Darbhanga, a young graduate of the Allahabad University of great promise. One fasciculus appeared during the year under review.\n\nThe manners and customs of the Hindus will for a long time remain an interesting subject of study for scholars and the great repositories of these are the Sm\u1e5bti works, especially the compilations. They exhibit the rituals in a variety of forms in different countries and at different times. Gad\u0101dhara, who flourished in the fourteenth century, made a Sm\u1e5bti compilation which has peculiar interest from the fact that Orissa had not then succumbed to Muhammedan influence. Pandita Sad\u0101\u015biva Mi\u1e63ra of Puri was therefore permitted to bring out an edition of Gad\u0101dhara's compilation known as Gad\u0101dharpaddhati. He has published one fasciculus during the year.\n\nPingala is reputed to be the originator of the science of Prosody among the Hindus. His S\u016btras in Sanskrit were published long ago by the Society and his work in Pr\u0101k\u1e5bt appeared from various places. The edition of the Pr\u0101k\u1e5bt work attributed to him, however, did not satisfy the needs of scholars. Therefore Babu Caudramohana Ghose, who had already distinguished himself by his excellent work on the Chandas entitled Chandah-s\u0101ra-samgraha, was permitted to bring out an edition of Pr\u0101k\u1e5btapainjgala with several commentaries and with indices and mathematical calculations. He has already published three fasciculi.\n\nObituary.\n\nThe Right Hon. Prof. F. Max M\u00fcller.\n\nThe Right Hon. Professor Dr. F. Max M\u00fcller, whose death occurred at Oxford in October, 1900, has been an Honorary Member of our Society since 1860. He was born at Dessau in Anhalt, Germany, on the 6th December 1823. His father Wilhelm M\u00fcller, a teacher and librarian at the Gymnasium, has made himself famous by his lyric poems, some of which are still much admired and often sung in Germany. By his mother M\u00fcller was descended from Basedow, the famous philanthropist and friend of Goethe. M\u00fcller was educated at Leipsic, where he also began his University course. Here it was Hermann Brockhaus, the editor of the Kath\u0101sarits\u0101gara and the Diw\u0101n of H\u0101fiz, who turned his mind towards the study of Oriental languages. He continued these studies at Berlin under Bopp and R\u00fcckert, and also went through a philosophical course under Schelling. Already at the age of twenty, he made himself known by a German translation of the Hitopade\u00e7a. After taking his degree of Ph.D. at Leipsic, he went to\nParis, then the centre of Oriental learning, where he studied under the famous Sanskrit scholar Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf, and the great Chinese scholar Stanislas Julien.\n\nAt that time to a young Sanskrit scholar a visit to England was indispensable. A very small portion only of Sanskrit texts was then available in print, but the libraries at London and Oxford contained vast treasures of Sanskrit manuscripts. It was for this reason that, in 1846, M\u00fcller decided to go to England. Here he was introduced to Bunsen, then the Prussian ambassador at London, and himself an enthusiastic admirer of Oriental thought and literature.\n\nThis event became decisive for his future career. It was through the mediation of Bunsen that the Court of Directors of the East India Company undertook to publish the edition of the Rg-Veda with the commentary of \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a, which M\u00fcller planned at that time, and for which it would have been impossible to find a private publisher. Through Bunsen also M\u00fcller was introduced to influential circles of English society and induced to settle finally in England. Here, at Oxford, he was appointed Professor of Modern Languages at the Taylorian Institute and elected a fellow of All Souls College. When in 1860 H. H. Wilson died, M\u00fcller was not, however, on account of his liberal views in theological and religious matters, elected as his successor to the Boden Professorship, although by his eminent work done in the field of Sanskrit studies he would have seemed to possess a strong claim to that post, and it was only in 1868 that he was appointed Professor of Comparative Philology. When, after the Franco-German war, the German Government reorganized the University at Strassburg, efforts were made to bring M\u00fcller back to his fatherland, and a professorship at the new University was offered to him. He did not accept it, however, partly in order to have more leisure for his literary work, and partly because England had become a second home to him from which he did not wish to separate; but he consented to deliver a course of lectures on Comparative Philology at the new University, and be granted a sum of money, the interest of which was to be given yearly as a prize for an essay on Vedic literature, the subject of which was to be determined by the University of Strassburg.\n\nHis distinguished career in England is too well known to be further detailed. Here intimate friendship connected him with many eminent men of his time. He had mastered the English language so thoroughly that he was able, within a few years after his arrival in England, to undertake for the first time an English translation of Kant's Kritik der reinen Vernunft, a very difficult task, as will be understood by every one who has tried to find his way through the writings of the great philosopher.\nof K\u00f6nigsberg. Although he never visited India, he had many friends and admirers among the natives of this country. By the simple pandit as well as by the nobleman he was looked upon with equal veneration as a friend and lover of India, who was always eager to impress upon Western minds what its ancient philosophy and literature can still teach us. The second edition of the Rg-Veda received a grant-in-aid from Indian princes, and the King of Siam enabled M\u00fcller to add to his Sacred Books of the East a second series devoted entirely to English translations of Buddhist scriptures. In India and all over the civilized world his name stands foremost in all matters connected with the study of languages and religions.\n\nM\u00fcller's literary and scientific work has been principally devoted to three branches: Sanskrit, especially Vedic literature, Comparative Philology, and the history of Religion. In the first of these three branches, the great edition of the Rg-Veda with the commentary of \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a, which has been already alluded to, is by far his most eminent work, and although less known to the general public than his literary essays, it has gained for him an everlasting place in the history of philological research.\n\nAt the time when Max M\u00fcller began his Oriental studies, the importance of the Veda had just dawned upon the mind of the then living generation of Sanskrit scholars. The early pioneers of Sanskrit studies had entirely contented themselves with the classical literature and almost totally neglected this earliest literary document of the Indo-European race. Even Colebrooke found its meanings too obscure, and its language too difficult, to expect that it would repay a careful study, and in his Essay on the Veda, published in 1805, he warned others against wasting any time on it. But in the forties of the last century matters had already changed. Friedrich Rosen had begun to publish a small portion of the Rg-Veda, which, however, had come to an early end by his sudden death in the prime of life. In Paris the great Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf, although his own publications dealt with the Avesta and Buddhistic literature, pointed out the great importance of the Veda. It was in Paris, too, that Rudolf Roth collected the materials for Vedic lexicography, which he incorporated later on into the great Petersburg dictionary, jointly edited by him and B\u00f6htlingk, and upon which he based his important book on the literature and history of the Veda. At that time the treasures of Vedic literature were still lying buried in manuscripts, and the first task accordingly was to publish the Vedic texts. Thus Benfey in G\u00f6ttingen brought out an edition of the \u015a\u0101ma-Veda, while Albrecht Weber in Berlin undertook to edit the voluminous \u010c\u0101kha of the White Yajur-Veda according to the recension of the V\u0101ja.\nsaneyi school, a work full of difficult discussions on intricate points of Vedic ritual.\n\nThe oldest and most important Vedic book, the Rg-Veda, was entrusted to Max M\u00fcller. It has already been related how he found an opportunity of publishing such a voluminous work. As he himself tells us, during the time he was engaged with this task, from 1850 up to 1875, he had to prepare for the press in each year 35 formes in large quarto size of a text full of intricate matter, requiring a thorough mastery of the language as well as of all other points connected with its interpretation. His edition of the Rg-Veda, which was published a second time some years ago, is universally acknowledged to be a standard work of its kind; and at present, where the interpretation of the often obscure hymns of the Vedic Rsis tends to vindicate to the commentary of S\u0101yana a greater value than originally had been given to it, he will be thanked for having spared no trouble in completing the often tedious task of preparing an edition of the entire commentary, instead of giving only abstracts, as had been done in similar cases.\n\nM\u00fcller's next valuable publication in the same branch is his History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature. In this book he attempts to lay open the subsequent strata of the vast bulk of Vedic writings. He begins with the latest of them, the S\u016btras, or ritualistic manuals, and shows how this class of literature presupposes an older one, the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, devoted to speculations on the various sections of the sacrifice, and on the meaning of the spells used in connexion with it. The Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, again, had before them collections of mantras or spells, which must go back to a remoter time, and these collections of mantras often exhibit a misunderstood and conventional use of hymns, which had been composed in a previous time, the period to which the oldest parts of Vedic literature go back. He thus distinguishes between four consecutive periods, which, in the order they followed one another, he calls the chandas-period or the period in which the Vedic hymns were composed, the mantra-period or the period in which they were put together into collections intended for sacrificial purposes, the br\u0101hma\u1e47a-period or the period of sacrificial speculation, and the s\u016btra-period or the period in which correct rules for the ritual were laid down. To each of these periods he attributes a certain amount of time, and starting from the supposition that the latest, or S\u016btra period, had come to a close some hundred years before the rise of Buddhism, he arrives at the year 1500 B.C. as the approximate beginning of Vedic literature. It has recently been attempted, on the strength of astronomical data contained in the Veda, to push this time about two thousand years further back, but these attempts cannot be\nsaid to have met with any general approval among competent authorities, while, on the other hand, the division of the four successive periods of Vedic literature is now universally accepted, and has been corroborated by further details brought to light by later researches.\n\nIn connexion with M\u00fcller's Sanskrit publications, his book on \"India, what it can teach us?\" also deserves mention. It originated from lectures delivered by him to the candidates of the Indian Civil Service at Cambridge, the object of which was to direct the interest of the future administrators of India towards the value which its literature, history, and antiquities still possess for us. In addition to those lectures he published an appendix detailing his views on the history and chronology of Sanskrit literature. His principal theory here is that of a revival of Sanskrit literature. He believes that after the Vedic and Epic periods the development of Sanskrit literature had been interrupted in the first centuries of the Christian era, while the greater part of India was under the sway of foreign invaders, Turanian princes, who imported foreign habits and were more addicted to Buddhism than to the promoters of Sanskrit literature, the Brahmans. The revival began in the fifth century, when princes of Indian blood again acquired a footing over their country and drove the strangers back, and it was at that time that classical Sanskrit literature sprung up. This theory is at present hardly any more accepted, but its value lies in formulating the problem and raising the discussion.\n\nIn speaking of M\u00fcller's literary works devoted to Comparative Philology and the history of Religion, I must not be misunderstood if I say that, wherever his work in this connexion is looked upon as original research, its due merit is not given to it. His Lectures on the Science of Language, published between 1861 and 1863, have certainly had a far reaching influence. Many a young student, fascinated by the masterly manner in which M\u00fcller understood how to handle the most tedious problems, owes to this book the first turn of his mind towards those studies, and it is greatly due to it that Comparative Philology became so popular not only in England but also on the Continent, as it was in the seventies and eighties of the last century. But although, at the time of its first appearance, it met only with isolated criticism from experts, such as Professor Whitney, yet now-a-days it is hardly spoken of any more. The progress of Comparative Philology in later years has been entirely ignored by M\u00fcller. His subsequent publications scarcely anywhere refer to new theories and discoveries, of which a great number have sprung up since 1875 so as to change the entire aspect of this science. By saying this, I do not wish to detract anything from his great merits. I readily admit that he has done more to promote the study of languages\nthan many a learned and most original publication but he has done so, not by adding any new and original results to this science, but by opening the eyes of the public to its value and importance.\n\nThe same must be said in regard to M\u00fcller's work on the history of Religion. Here we owe to him that most important publication, the Sacred Books of the East, a collection of English translations of the standard works of all the great religions of Asia. It exhibits in a singular manner his great talent as an organizer. He himself contributed a translation of the Dhammapada and of the Upanishads, and he acquired for it the co-operation of first class authorities in each respective branch. Thus, whoever is interested in Oriental religions has now an easy access to the standard works of Hinduism, Buddhism, the religions of Jains and Parsis, the philosophies of Confucius and Lao-tse, all laid before him in thoroughly trustworthy translations, which are equally valuable to the specialist as they are interesting to an amateur. But I regret to be unable to express the same opinion on M\u00fcller's own Essays on the history of Religion. His mythological theories are now happily discarded by most authorities, and if one tries to read through some of his later books, such as Physical Religion, Anthropological Religion, or whatever its name may be, one rests surprised to find under the glittering garment of a brilliant style so little that is new, nay, even so little that one does not recollect to have met with somewhere else in M\u00fcller's earlier books. He certainly was a most brilliant writer, and as his books, too, originated from lectures delivered by him, not before experts, but before a larger circle of amateurs, one may even say that he was under a certain necessity to please his hearers rather than to feed them on the dry fare of new facts and theories.\n\nThus, while M\u00fcller stands foremost among the pioneers of Vedic studies, his work in connexion with other branches of the study of languages and religion does not excel by original research, and yet has greatly helped to promote their popularity. But the advancement of science rests upon both, and he who endeavours to spread the knowledge found by others acquires no little merit. And the student who has made the study of Oriental languages and religions his life-work, ought never to forget the amount of gratitude he owes to the late Max M\u00fcller for the reputation in which this branch of learning has been and still is held.\n\n[T. Bloch.]\n\nJohn Anderson, M.D., F.R.S.\n\nBy the death, on August 15th, 1900, of Dr. John Anderson, the Society has lost one of its oldest and most distinguished members, whose connexion with the Society dated from January, 1865.\nDr. Anderson was born on the 4th October, 1833, and graduated M.D. in the University of Edinburgh in 1861, his graduation thesis which was entitled \"Contributions to Zoology,\" indicating the natural bent of his mind.\n\nBefore this he had already carried out some successful dredging operations off the coast of Scotland, and about this time he initiated his long series of Zoological publications with two papers On an Apparently New Form of Holothuria, and On the Anatomy of Sacculina, which appeared in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History for 1862.\n\nAfter holding the Professorship of Natural Science in the Free Church College at Edinburgh for two years, he came to Calcutta, where his name is permanently associated, monumentum aere perennius, with the foundation of the Indian Museum and with the origins of our zoological knowledge of Upper Burma and Mergui.\n\nHe will also be remembered as one of the earliest advocates of a Zoological Garden for Calcutta, and as one of the experts who greatly assisted in giving shape to that Institution when it was started.\n\nDr. W. T. Blanford, than whom there is no one more competent to speak at first hand, has already, in \"Nature,\" given a review of his scientific work, from which the following paragraphs are extracted:\n\n\"His arrival in Calcutta was at a fortunate time. The Asiatic Society of Bengal had gradually come into the possession of a large collection, not only of the archaeological remains, manuscripts, coins and similar objects, for the study of which the Society was originally established, but also of zoological and geological specimens in large numbers. In the course of the preceding quarter of a century the collections had increased, chiefly through the work of Edward Blyth, the curator, until the Society's premises were crowded, and the Society's funds no longer sufficed for the proper preservation and exhibition of the specimens collected. After long negotiations, interrupted by the disturbances of 1857, arrangements were completed in 1864 by which the archaeological and zoological collections of the Society (the geological specimens had been previously transferred) were taken over by the Government of India, who undertook to build a new museum in Calcutta, of which the Society's collections would form the nucleus. The trustees appointed by the Government to manage the new museum asked the Secretary of State for India to select a curator, and Dr. J. Anderson was nominated for the post early in 1865. His status was changed, a few years later, to that of superintendent of the museum, and in addition to his museum work he became Professor of Comparative Anatomy at the Medical College, Calcutta. He held both offices until his retirement from India in 1886.\"\nThe time at which Dr. Anderson arrived in India was fortunate in another respect. It coincided with a great impulse given to Indian zoology by the publication of Jerdon's \"Birds of India,\" the last volume of which appeared in 1864, and with the presence in Calcutta of a larger number of men interested in the study of the fauna than were assembled there at any time before or since. Amongst these men were Jerdon himself, Ferdinand Stoliczka, Francis Day, and Valentine Ball, all of whom have now passed away. Probably at no time has so much progress been made in the study of Indian Vertebrata as in the years 1864-74, and in this work Dr. Anderson took an important part.\n\nThe new Indian Museum, which now towers over the other buildings of Chowringhee, was not ready for occupation till 1875, but meantime Dr. Anderson had been busily engaged in adding to the zoological collections and in getting them into order. One of his first tasks was the bringing together of an ethnological series, for which the conditions of Calcutta are favourable. Amongst other important additions made by him was that of a fine series of human skulls representing various Indian races. Another very valuable museum series brought together by him consisted of a good collection of Indian Chelonia: skeletons, carapaces and stuffed specimens.\n\nThe work in Calcutta was interrupted by two important expeditions to Upper Burma and Yunnan, to both of which Dr. Anderson was attached as naturalist and medical officer. Both expeditions were designed to pass through China to Canton or Shanghai, but in neither case was it found practicable to carry out the original plan. The first expedition, commanded by Colonel E. B. Sladen, left Calcutta at the end of 1867, proceeded as far as Momein in Yunnan, and returned to India in November 1868; the second, under the command of Colonel Horace Browne, left in January 1875, but was treacherously attacked by the Chinese before it had proceeded more than three marches beyond the Burmese frontier, and compelled to return, Mr. Margery, of the Chinese Consular Service, who had been despatched to accompany the mission, and who had preceded it by a march, being murdered with several of his followers. The difficulties experienced by both missions from the time they crossed the frontier between Burma and China, and the opposition of the inhabitants of the country, seriously interfered with zoological observations, and the collection of specimens was generally impossible; but still some important additions were made to the previous knowledge of the fauna. A full account of the journey was given in Dr. Anderson's reports and in a work by him, entitled \"Manday to Momein,\" published in 1876. The detailed observations on zoology, supplemented by important notes on some Indian and Burmese\nmammals and chelonians, were published in 1878-9, under the title of \"Anatomical and Zoological Researches, comprising an Account of the Zoological Results of two Expeditions to Western Yunnan in 1869 and 1875, and a Monograph of the two Cetacean Genera, Platanista and Orcella.\" The work appeared in two quarto volumes, one consisting of plates. Dr. Anderson was the first who succeeded in obtaining specimens of the porpoise (Orcella) inhabiting the Irrawaddi, and the examination of this previously undescribed form led him to make a thorough anatomical investigation of an allied species occurring in the Bay of Bengal and in the estuaries of rivers flowing into the bay, and also of the remarkable cetacean, Platanista, inhabiting the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Indus.\n\nThe only other important collecting expedition undertaken by Dr. Anderson during his tenure of the superintendentship of the Indian Museum was to Tenasserim and the Mergui Archipelago in 1881-2. This journey was chiefly, though by no means exclusively, undertaken for the collection of marine animals, and the descriptions of the results, to which several naturalists contributed, were published first in the Journal of the Linnean Society, and subsequently as a separate reprint in two volumes, under the title of \"Contributions to the Fauna of Mergui and its Archipelago.\" This appeared in 1889. Dr. Anderson's share was the description of the Vertebrata and an account of the Selungs\u2014a curious tribe inhabiting some of the islands; but in connection with his visit to Mergui, and as part of a general description of the fauna which he had at first proposed to publish, he prepared an account of the history of Tenasserim, formerly belonging to Siam. This historical r\u00e9sum\u00e9, which deals especially with British commercial and political intercourse with Siamese and Burmese ports, was compiled mainly from the manuscript records of the East India Company, preserved in the library of the India Office, and was published in 1889 in a separate volume, entitled \"English Intercourse with Siam.\" The book forms a well-written and interesting chapter of the history of British progress in Southern Asia.\n\nBesides the works already mentioned and many papers, descriptive of mammalia and reptiles, which were published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal and in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, Dr. Anderson wrote two catalogues on very different subjects for the museum under his charge in Calcutta. Of these, one was the first part of the \"Catalogue of Mammals,\" published in 1881, the other the \"Catalogue and Handbook of the Archaeological Collection\" which appeared in 1883.\n\nDr. Anderson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1879,\nand retired from the Indian Service in 1886. He had married a few years previously, and after retiring he travelled with his wife to Japan. Finally he settled in London, but for the remainder of his life his health was somewhat precarious, and he passed several winters in Egypt. Here he took up the study of the mammals and reptiles, which had received but scant attention since the early part of the century, when the great and superbly illustrated French work on Egypt appeared\u2014a work which, brilliantly begun by Savigny and others, was never adequately completed.\n\nTo the work of collecting, examining, figuring and describing the Mammalia, Reptilia and Batrachia of Egypt, the later part of Dr. Anderson's life, when he was well enough for work, was mainly devoted. He also paid some attention to the fauna of the neighbouring countries, and in 1898 published \"A Contribution to the Herpetology of Arabia,\" founded on the collections of the late Mr. J. T. Bent and others. The first part of the important work he had intended to produce on the zoology of Egypt, containing an account of the physical features of the country and descriptions of Reptilia and Batrachia, appeared in 1898. It is a fine quarto volume with excellent figures, many of them coloured. He had made large collections and notes for the volume on Mammalia, and these it is hoped will be published in due course.\n\nOne of the last undertakings in which Dr. Anderson engaged, as soon as the Upper Nile valley was once more thrown open to civilisation, was the systematic collection and description of the fish inhabiting the river and its tributaries. That this important work (of which a notice appeared in NATURE of February 23, 1899) is now being carried out with warm interest and assistance from the Egyptian Government, must be attributed to Dr. Anderson's foresight, zeal and skilful advocacy. Both in our Indian Empire and in North-Eastern Africa, Dr. Anderson contributed much to the solution of one the chief biological questions of the present day, an accurate knowledge of the distribution of animal life.\"\n\n[A.

E. Drake-Brockman, I.M.S., and Dr. F. Noetling were ballotted for and elected and re-elected respectively Ordinary Members.\nA vacancy having occurred owing to the death of the Right Hon. Prof. F. Max M\u00fcller, the Council recommended Prof. J. W. Judd, C.B., LL.D., F.R.S., for election as Honorary Member at the next meeting. In accordance with the provisions of Rule 13 the Secretary read the following note on Prof. Judd's work.\n\nDr. Judd commenced his study of Science by entering the Royal School of Mines as a student in 1863, when he was already 23 years of age, having previously been engaged in teaching and literary work. Notwithstanding, a long and serious interruption, due to being disabled in a railway accident, his brilliant geological work secured for him an admission to the Royal Society in 1877 at an unusually early age, soon after he had been selected for the chair of Geology at the Royal School of Mines in succession to Sir Andrew Ramsay. In 1885, he presided over the Geological Section of the British Association, and in 1886 was elected President of the Geological Society of London, serving at the same time on the Council of the Royal Society. In 1891, the Geological Society recognised his scientific work by conferring on him the highest honour at their disposal, namely, the Wollaston medal. In 1895, Prof. Judd was appointed Dean of the Royal College of Science as successor to the late Right Hon. Prof. Huxley, and in the same year was created a Companion of the Order of the Bath.\n\nCommencing work on the Geological Survey of England by mapping the Mesozoic rocks of Lincolnshire and Rutland, Professor Judd passed on to the secondary rocks of Scotland, where contact with a large number of igneous rocks led him to take up the then comparatively new study of microscopic petrography, and to apply the new methods to a systematic study of the volcanoes of Hungary and the Mediterranean islands. To his extensive papers on these subjects the rapid development of microscopic petrology was largely due. During recent years Prof. Judd has turned his attention to mineralogy, studying especially the nature of etch-figures and the internal structure-planes of crystals. Some of his papers on these subjects had been based on Indian material, and to him we are indebted for a study of amblystegite from the Nilgiris, tourmaline and corundum from Mysore and Rewah, and, finally, an exhaustive memoir on the ruby and its associates in the crystalline limestones of Burma. Not the least amongst the debts which India owes to Professor Judd will be found in the work of a large number of pupils in different parts of the country, with whom this our tribute to the value of his work will be specially popular.\n\nThe General Secretary reported the presentation from the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, of a gold coin found in the Bijapur District.\nThe General Secretary announced that Mahamahopadhyaya Haraprasad Shastri, Joint Philological Secretary had been appointed to officiate as Philological Secretary during the absence of Dr. Bloch.\n\nThe proposal to alter the status of the Society of which intimation had already been given by circular to all members was brought up for final disposal. The votes of the members were laid on the table and the President requested any Resident members who had not expressed their opinion to take the present opportunity of filling in voting papers. 3 such papers were filled in and with the 98 returned by members were scrutinized, the President appointing Mr. F. E. Pargiter, Mr. W. A. Lee, and Mr. A. Pedler to be Scrutineers. The Scrutineers reported as follows:\n\n**PROPOSALS.**\n\n(1) To emphasize the fact that the Society was founded to investigate all branches of knowledge, and to advance research in and culture of all forms of learning, that its work should be carried on under three main heads, namely:\n\n1. Literature.\n2. Science.\n3. Art.\n\nFor ... ... 79\nAgainst ... ... 18\n\n(2) To appoint Fellows and Associates in order that the Society may have at its disposal the means of showing its appreciation of good work done by its members, and thereby also attracting persons to join its ranks especially from the provinces and from affiliated societies.\n\nFor ... ... 66\nAgainst ... ... 80\n\n(3) That the number of Fellows should be limited to a maximum of 36; and that the number of Associates should be double that of the Fellows. The Fellowships and Associateships should be allotted to the three branches, Literature, Science and Art, in the proportion of 2, 3 and 1 respectively as nearly as possible, this being approximately the ratio of the relative dimensions of these branches.\n\nFor ... ... 68\nAgainst ... ... 26\nProposal to alter the status of the Society.\n\n(4) That any existing society in India which has been established for the promotion of knowledge may be invited to become affiliated to this Society, and should, if it accepts affiliation, receive, on the payment of a general contribution; the publications of this, the chief Society, permission for its members to attend meetings of the Society, and to share in the awards of Fellowships and Associateships, provided that on election all Fellows and Associates join the Society as Members.\n\nFor ... ... 74\nAgainst ... ... 22\n\n(5) That the rates of subscription should be changed to suit members who prefer to take only special parts of the Society's publications. The following scale is suggested to replace the present system of charging Resident and Non-Resident Members respectively Rs. 36 and Rs. 24 a year:\n\nMembership (Resident) with Proceedings, Rs. 24 per annum.\nDo. (Non-Resident) do., 16 do.\n\nReceiving Journals also\n\n| 1 Part. | 2 Parts. | 3 Parts. |\n|---------|----------|----------|\n| Resident | Rs. 30   | Rs. 36   | Rs. 40   |\n| Non-Resident | \u201e 22 | \u201e 28 | \u201e 32 |\n\nFor ... ... 68\nAgainst ... ... 22\n\n(6) That abstracts of current literature, of immediate interest to the members, such as are made in many Asiatic Societies, as well as in Societies devoted to Natural Science and Technology, should be published at frequent and regular intervals in each division, and that attempts should be made to make the publications of the Society more generally interesting and useful to workers, especially to those who live at a distance from the capitals. The advantages of this are obvious.\n\nFor ... ... 90\nAgainst ... ... 8\n\n(7) That the name of the Society should be changed to \"Royal Society of India for the promotion of Literature, Science and Art.\"\n\nFor ... ... 55\nAgainst ... ... 40\n(8) That a Charter or an Act of Incorporation be applied for Royal Charter from the Crown through the Government of India, and with propriety a regular grant may be asked for from the latter, and possibly also from the Local Governments.\n\nFor ... ... 86\nAgainst ... ... 10\n\n(9) If the Society is re-constituted and its aspirations and usefulness expanded, its government must be changed. It is suggested that this may be effected (a) by adding to it a Patron, who would it is hoped be the Viceroy and Governor-General and 5 Vice-Patrons, who would be Governors, Lieutenant-Governors, Chief Commissioners and Indian Princes elected for a term; (b) by retaining the President, who should be a Fellow, and the 3 Vice-Presidents, who may be Fellows, Associates, or perhaps Ordinary Members; (c) by retaining the Council, which would be composed of the President, Vice-Presidents and a certain proportion of Fellows, Associates and Members who might be elected (as at present) as being likely from their residence in Calcutta to assist in the business of the Society; and it may be useful to have members of Council also in other large towns or centres who would preside over branch meetings such as for example is held this year in Simla; and (d) by appointing additional Secretaries and other officers of sections as may be required, and a General Secretary.\n\nFor ... ... 78\nAgainst ... ... 14\n\nThe voting shows a three-quarters majority in favour of proposals Nos. (1), (4), (5), (6), (8) and (9), whilst there is an insufficient majority in favour of Nos. (2), (3) and (7).\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nOF THE\n\nASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL,\n\nFOR MARCH AND APRIL, 1901.\n\nThe Monthly General Meeting of the Society was held on Wednesday, the 6th March, 1901, at 9 p.m.\n\nF.

Prain, I.M.S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe writer, who has for the past four years been engaged in his spare time in studying the species of Dalbergia of S.-E. Asia with a view to publishing a monograph of the genus has been able to study the material contained in the following herbaria (1) Calcutta, (2) Kew, (3) British Museum, (4) Herb. Wallich, (5) Herb. Linn\u00e6us, (6) Herbarium of M. Drake del Castillo, Paris, (7) Herb. Peradeniya, Ceylon, all of which he has visited. The following collections of Dalbergia have also been sent to him for study in Calcutta, (8) Herb. Berlin, lent by Prof. Engler, (9) Herb. Leiden, lent by the late Prof. Saringar, (10) Herb. De Candolle, Geneva, lent by M. de Candolle, (11) Herb. Boissier, Geneva, lent by M. Barbey, (12) Herb. Beccari, Florence, lent by Sig. Beccari, (13) Herb. Buitenzorg, lent by Dr. Treub, (14) Herb. Paris, lent by M. Bureau, (15) Herb. Saharanpur, lent by Mr. Duthie (16) Herb. Hongkong, lent by Mr. Ford. Specimens of the only Dalbergia in Herb. Brisbane have also been sent by Mr. Bailey. Circumstances rendering it necessary to forego, for the moment, the publication of the projected monograph the writer has drawn up a hand list of the 74 known Asiatic Species of Dalbergia with a tolerably complete bibliography and a full record of their distribution as indicated by specimens in the sixteen herbaria whose collections have been studied. In all except the very common and salient species reference is made to the field-numbers on the various specimens in order that the list may be of use not only to members of our Society and to those who may study the specimens in the herbaria the writer has examined, but also to those who may work in other herbaria not yet visited by the writer in which duplicates bearing these numbers are preserved.\n\n3. Marriage customs of the Khonds.\u2014By J. E. Friend-Pereira, B.A. Communicated by the Anthropological Secretary.\n4. Materials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula, No. 12.\u2014By Sir George King, K.C.I.E., LL.D., F.R.S., &c., late Superintendent of the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe paper contains descriptions of all the species of the Natural Order Myrtaceae known to be indigenous to the Malay Peninsula, to the Straits Settlements and to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands; and it has been prepared after examining the rich collections contained in the Herbaria of the Royal Botanic Gardens of Kew and Calcutta and of the Government Gardens at Singapore and Penang. The species described in it amount to 122 and these are distributed amongst 11 genera. This proportion closely resembles that obtaining for the same family in Sir Joseph Hooker's Flora of British India, in which there are described 157 species belonging to practically the same genera, for Pseudo-Eugenia (the additional genus given here) has been carved out of Eugenia since Hooker's Flora was completed. In both Floras the largest genus is Eugenia, of which there are 131 species given in Hooker's work as against 96 in the present paper. Of these 96 no fewer than 50 are here described for the first time. And, as the Malay Peninsula and the adjacent islands fall within, the limits of British India (as understood by Hooker, the Eugenia of British India now stand at 181. Besides the 50 new species of Eugenia, there are described in the paper 4 new species of the beautiful littoral genus Barringtonia\u2014plants which, in addition to possessing handsome flowers, are remarkable for their curious fruits. Novelties are also described under the genera Tristani, Pseudo-Eugenia and Planchonia.\n\nThe total known number of species of Myrtaceae is very great, being estimated at about 2,300. These are distributed chiefly over the warm parts of Asia, Australasia, Africa and America, only one (the common Myrtle) being indigenous in Europe.\n\nThe Myrtaceae are most abundant in South America, and they make a large proportionate part of the vegetation of Australia in which island very large and important forests consist for the most part of species of Eucalyptus.\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nOF THE\n\nASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL.\n\nFOR JULY, 1901.\n\nThe Monthly General Meeting of the Society was held on Wednesday, the 3rd July, 1901, at 9.15 p.m.\n\nMajor A.

The temple, they say, is situated 'on the far side of Gujar\u0101t.'\"\n\nI would suggest that the place intended is Hingl\u0101j in Makr\u0101n, which is shown on the map in Sir Thomas H. Holdich's \"The Indian Borderland\" (London, Methuen & Co., 1901). On p. 206 Sir T. Holdich say \"the most ancient and honourable ziarat of Hingl\u0101j is hidden away in the clefts of the mountains (a ziarat so ancient that both Hindus and Mahomedans claim it, without recognising its almost prehistoric Persian origin).\" This Hingl\u0101j (=Hingl\u0101j) may be described as on the \"far side of Gujar\u0101t;\" it being over two hundred miles west of the most western part of Gujar\u0101t.\n\nMajor A. Alcock, F.R.S., exhibited models of snakes and of a deep-sea fish Odontostomus atratus which had swallowed a cuttle fish of considerably greater diameter than itself.\n\nThe following paper was read:\u2014\n\nThe growth of Calcareous Tufa in the Rivers of the Shan States, Upper Burma.\u2014By T. H. D. La Touche, B.A.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe formation of beds of calcareous tufa in countries where limestone is the prevailing rock is a well-known natural phenomenon. Rain water containing a small proportion of carbonic acid derived from the atmosphere, flowing through crevices in the rock, is enabled to dissolve a certain amount of it, and on reaching the open-air this is deposited as the water evaporates.\n\nIn many of the rivers of the Shan States in Upper Burma, where the hills are largely composed of limestone, large masses of calcareous tufa are deposited, forming regular dams across the river often 20 feet or more in height. These are built up wherever the water is in violent motion, as at the heads of rapids, where it seems improbable that the\nparticles of carbonate of lime could be retained, if the process of deposition were merely mechanical. The growing surface of the deposit is always covered with a growth of bright green algae and it is well-known that chlorophyll bearing algae have the power, under the influence of light, of directly assimilating the carbon contained in carbonic acid. It seems probable therefore that these algae which naturally grow most rapidly in position where there is a considerable rush of water, bringing an abundance of their natural food, assist in the deposition of the carbonate of lime by destroying the carbonic acid which holds it in solution; while the felted mass of fibrous algae affords a means of retaining the minute particles of calcite and allowing them to grow together into the granular crystalline deposit of which the dams are built up.\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nOF THE\n\nASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL.\n\nFOR AUGUST, 1901.\n\nThe Monthly General Meeting of the Society was held on Wednesday, the 7th August, 1901, at 9-15 p.m.\n\nTHE HON.

Communicated by the Anthropological Secretary.\n\nMajor Alcock read the following paper, by Miss Nelly Evans, upon the habits of the common grey mosquito of Calcutta. The paper is interesting as giving detailed evidence, with regard to the female of this species of mosquito, (1) that it may live, in its adult or imago stage, for nearly five weeks, (2) that during its adult life it may feed as many as five times, and (3) that it does not feed indiscriminately, but has a preference for the blood of the house-sparrow, refusing that of Java-sparrows, larks, rails, and white rate.\n\nAll these facts, but the last one in particular, favour the possibility of the insect being a carrier of a definite blood-infection, and support the conclusions of Ross based upon experiments with this species of mosquito.\n6. Some Observations on the Life-history of Culex fatigans, the Common Grey Mosquito of Lower Bengal.\u2014By NELLY EVANS.\n\nThis investigation was carried out during February and March, in the Indian Museum, Calcutta.\n\nCulex fatigans will live for about a month if fed on fruit only, but the female does not lay eggs unless she has a meal of blood. A few individuals were kept without food of any kind and some of these lived as long as ten days. Culex fatigans feeds readily on the common house-sparrow, but it was found that the insect would not bite Java-sparrows or larks or rails or white rats, all of which were tried. The common house-sparrow was therefore used to supply the necessary meal of blood.\n\nThe female mosquito lays its eggs from four to six days after feeding, and the time seems to depend on the amount of blood taken. It was noticed that if the insect gorged itself the eggs were laid on the fifth day or sooner, whereas if less blood was taken, the time between feeding and laying the egg-boat was longer, sometimes as long as ten or fourteen days; and if very little was taken a second meal of blood was required before the eggs were laid. The female mosquito feeds again on the sparrow the night after laying her eggs, and will lay a second batch of eggs at the end of five days, so that if she is always able to obtain a meal of blood, she will lay a batch of eggs about every five or six days or roughly once a week.\n\nOf fourteen female mosquitos kept to ascertain the duration of life, and number of repasts of blood, and number of egg-boats laid, two lived for twenty-eight and twenty-nine days respectively and each fed five times on the sparrow and laid five egg-boats; one died after twenty days, after feeding three times and laying three egg-boats, and one died after eighteen days having fed three times and laid two egg-boats. All the others were either lost or were killed accidentally, some after having laid two or three batches of eggs and having lived thirty and thirty-three days. In those that lived as long as thirty and thirty-three days the time between feeding and laying the eggs was more than five days and in one case was as long as fourteen days. In all these experiments a male was kept with the female during feeding as well as before and after.\n\nAnother experiment was tried to see if the female will lay eggs if fed apart from the male. Ross states in his West African Report that the female will not lay eggs unless fed in the presence of the male, that is, that fertilisation takes place after feeding. If the meal of blood is required for the nutrition of the eggs it would seem more reasonable to suppose that the insect's instinct would be to seek the\nanimal food after fertilisation, not before. To decide this point ten females were put alone in the net with the sparrows, all having previously been with males. Of these ten, only four fed, and these four were removed to another cage. They were watched from day to day, and it was noticed that the blood gradually disappeared from the abdomen, which in all but one assumed the white opaque appearance generally characteristic of mosquitos which are going to lay eggs. In the exception, the abdomen looked transparent and empty. Six days passed and no eggs were laid, and on the seventh day, no mosquitos could be found at all and there were no egg-boats. No dead mosquitos were found either. So that the experiment failed.\n\nLater on, the same experiment was tried with two mosquitos one of which was lost, while the other laid eggs on the fifth day.\n\nThe eggs are generally laid at night, and the following night the larvae hatch out. Some mosquitos were reared from the egg in the laboratory: the larval stage lasted at least twenty days, and the pupal stage four days. The larvae and pupae were very small and the mosquito was only a third or fourth the size of those reared naturally out of doors, while some of the larvae reared in the Museum had not changed to pupae as late as forty-seven days after the eggs were laid. It was found that dessication of the egg-boat for one day was generally sufficient to prevent the larvae from hatching out though one or two larvae did hatch out of an egg-boat which had been dried for six days.\n\nThe egg-boat has been described so often that it is unnecessary to go through its description again. There is, however, one part of the individual egg which has never been described and that is the structure forming part of the lid. This is best seen in the egg obtained by dissection of the gravid female mosquito, but only after it has reached a fair size, that is two or three days after the insect has fed. The eggs so obtained will be seen to be capped at the larger end by a transparent dome-shaped structure which is a continuation of the shell of the egg, but not of its whole thickness. It is a very delicate structure and gets damaged very easily. The whole cap is easily broken off and for this reason is rarely seen in eggs after they have been laid, as the caps get broken off in removing them from the water. The function of this cap is probably to act as a float, and to keep that end of the egg in contact with the water. Inside and at the base of this dome-shaped cap and in contact with the end of the egg is another peculiar structure. This is a cup-shaped cell, with a hole or depression in the centre, which fits on to a projection at the end of the egg shell, and radiating filaments at the circumference which turn up into the float.\ncap and lie in contact with the sides of it. When the float cap breaks, the cup-shaped cell comes away and becomes flattened out and then looks like a star. The end of the egg shell itself which forms the lid is ornamented with what appears to be radiating knobs, larger at the centre than at the circumference. The lid of the egg can be well seen in an empty egg-boat. The egg-boat when empty presents a very different appearance from that when it is full. To the naked eye the latter looks compact and neat, whereas the former has an untidy and rough appearance; it is also lighter in colour than the other. Under a magnifying glass the eggs of the empty boat are seen to be opened at the large end which rests on the water, and the lids of the eggs forming the sides and ends of the boat can be plainly seen as they lie open at right angles to the length of the egg and the ornamentation of the lid is well shown. If the unhatched egg-boat is taken from the water and left on a slide till it has become dry, and then removed, a pattern is seen on the slide formed by the star-shaped bodies which have become detached from the ends of the eggs and are stuck to the glass.\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nOF THE\n\nASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL.\n\nFOR NOVEMBER, 1901.\n\nThe Monthly General Meeting of the Society was held on Wednesday, the 6th November, 1901, at 9 p.m.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. C. W. Bolton, C.S.I., Vice-President, in the chair.\n\nThe following members were present:\n\nMajor A. Alcock, I.M.S., Mr. C. G. H. Allen, Major W. J. Buchanan, I.M.S., Mr. I. H. Burkill, Mr. H.

B. H. Panton, I.C.S., and Major W. J. Buchanan, I.M.S., were elected Ordinary Members during the recess in accordance with Rule 7.\n\nMr J. J. Cotton, and Shams-ul-Ulama Mahomed Zakaullah have expressed a wish to withdraw from the Society.\n\nThe Secretary reported the death of Dr. A. von Krafft, an Ordinary Member of the Society.\n\nThe Chairman announced that in accordance with Rule 38 of the Society's Rules, the names of Dr. Sarat Chandra Laharry, Mr. R. Mitra,\nMr. D. Sunder, and Pandit Mahendra Nath Vidyanidhi had been posted up as defaulting members since the last meeting and will be removed from the Member List.\n\nThe General Secretary reported the presentation of the following coins:\n\nFrom the Government of N.-W.P., one silver and one copper coin.\nFrom the Madras Government Museum, two silver and two copper coins.\nFrom the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, one gold coin.\n\nMr. I. H. Burkill exhibited some seedlings of *Eugenia jambolana* from seeds which had passed through the intestine of a Flying-fox.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. *On Variation in the Flower of Ranunculus arvensis: A study of Flower Symmetry.*\u2014By I. H. BURKILL.\n\n2. *A short notice of a Persian MS. on Gaur.*\u2014By H. BEVERIDGE, I.C.S. (retired).\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper draws attention to a Persian MS. in the India Office Library, containing an account of the buildings and inscriptions at Rajmahal, Gaur, and Panduah. It is the result of local investigations made by Shy\u0101m Prasad in November and December, 1810, when he visited Gaur in attendance on Major Francklin. The report was drawn up for Major Francklin and appears to be the source of the information given in Francklin's Journal, of which good use has been made by Mrs. Ravenshaw and Mr. Grote, in Ravenshaw's Gaur. The really new part in Shy\u0101m Prasad's report, according to Mr. Beveridge, seems to be his first chapter which gives an account of Rajmahal. Mr. Beveridge recommends the publication of the report.\n\n3. *A short note on the date of the death of Nur Qutb 'Alam.*\u2014By H. BEVERIDGE, I.C.S. (retired).\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nMr. Beveridge was the first to point out that according to a history written some 20 years ago by Ilahi Bakhsh, a school master of Maldah, the death of Nur Qutb 'Alam, the famous saint of Panduah, occurred on the 7th Zilgad 818=A.D. 1416, 8th January. This date fits best\nwith what history tells about that saint. For he is said to have been a fellow-student with the Bengal King Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah, who was still alive in 814, but must have died soon afterwards. It is accordingly interesting to find the same date recorded in a MS., in the British Museum, called the Mirat-ul-Asrar. The only difference, as Mr. Beveridge points out, is that in the latter place the day is the 10th, instead of the 7th Zilgada.\n\n4. New species of Indian Hymenoptera.\u2014By Major C. G. Nurse.

Notes on two coins of the Sunga Dynasty.\u2014By Colonel C. E. Shepherd. Communicated by the Philological Secretary.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe coins dealt with in this paper belong to a well-known class of Ancient Indian Copper Coins, which are generally attributed to the so-called Sunga Kings, who ruled in northern India from B.C. 176-66. The two specimens described by Col. Shepherd exhibit two new names, viz., Dhruva Mitra and Rudra Gupta, but nothing beside their names is known with regard to those two Kings.\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nOF THE\n\nASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL.\n\nFOR DECEMBER, 1901.\n\nThe Monthly General Meeting of the Society was held on Wednesday, the 4th December 1901, at 9 p.m.\n\nTHE HON.

Communicated by the Philological Secretary.\n\n(Abstract).\n\nThis is the third paper under this heading, the first being published in 1891 and the second in 1894. The second paper brought the History of Ladakh down to the Dogra conquest in 1822 and the settlement of the country under Wazir Zorawar Singh. The present paper gives the history of the attempts made both by the Tibetans and the Ladakhis to make Ladakh independent. Though at first successful, their combined army had at last to give way before the superior force of the Kashmirians. The paper ends with the final settlement of the country under Gulab Singh, Rajah of Kashmir.\n\n5. On the authenticity of the two newly discovered Manuscripts of the Vall\u0101lacarita by Ananda Bhatta, and their importance in tracing the History of the Caste System in Bengal. Part I.\u2014By Mahamahopadhyaya Haraprasad Shastri.\n\n(Abstract).\n\nBall\u0101la Carita means the Biography of Ball\u0101l Sen, the greatest King of the Sen Dynasty in Bengal, in the 12th century. Two com-\nplete MSS. have been obtained written in different parts of Burdwan, one in 1707 A.D., the year of Aurangzebe's death, and the other in 1198 of the Bengali era.\n\nThe book was composed in 1432 by Ananda Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, a descendant of Ananta Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, whom Ballal Sen settled in East Bengal by a grant of land. It was written at the court of Buddhimanta Khan, the R\u0101ja of Navadvipa, a great admirer of Caitanya, who flourished about this time.\n\nAnanda Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da's book is based on three previous works by three writers, contemporaries of Ballala Sen, viz., (1) the Vy\u0101sa Pur\u0101\u1e47a by \u015ai\u1e43ha Giri, a \u0100\u015bva monk from Vadarik\u0101\u1e47\u1e0drama in the Him\u0101layas, who converted Ball\u0101l into the \u0100\u015bva faith; (2) Ball\u0101la Carita by \u010car\u0101\u1e47a Datte, one of the great poets under the same dynasty; (3) Jayamangala G\u0101th\u0101 by K\u0101lid\u0101sa Nandi, mentioned in Ba\u1e6du D\u0101sa's Anthology, compiled in 1205 A.D. The information given in Ananda Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da's work agrees, to a great extent, with the results of modern historical researches, and so it can be accepted as an authentic record of Ball\u0101la's reign.\n\nThe present paper ends with the proofs of the authenticity of the work, and in the next paper will be given the caste precedents in Bengal as settled by Ball\u0101la.\n\n6. A Note on the existence of the Magi, the Median Priesthood in India, at the present day.\u2014By Mah\u0101mahop\u0101dhy\u0101ya Harapras\u0101d Sh\u0101stri.\n\n(Abstract).\n\nAt the end of the enumeration of the subdivisions of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a caste in India in the 16th chapter of the Ball\u0101la Carita there occurs a curious verse which translated into English would run thus:\u2014\n\n\"The Magas, i.e., Magi, too, are Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, who issuing from the disc of the Sun and shining like the blazing Sun, dropped in the \u010cakadvipa\"?\n\nThere are throughout India Br\u0101hma\u1e47as known as \u010c\u0101ka-dvipi or \u010c\u0101kala-dvipi, who like the Magi generally devote themselves to Astrology, Divination, Propitiation of Planetary Deities, and similar subjects. When engaged in their proper work they are respected as Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, but when not so engaged they are not so regarded.\n\nIt is not difficult, therefore, to identify these \u010c\u0101ka-dvipi Br\u0101hma\u1e47as as the Magi of old, and we have the high authority of \u015ai\u1e43ha Giri, the Guru of Ball\u0101la, in our support.\n\nNow the question is, when did the Magi come into India, and who they were? They are said to have been Zoroastrian priests, but this statement is to be taken with reservation. In the G\u0101th\u0101s of the Avesta\nthere is no mention of any Priesthood. In the Y\u0101shnas they are called the Athravans. In the Vendidad, for the first time we find divination, foretelling and other things of similar nature, so repugnant to the founder of the religion, first introduced into the religion of Zoroaster. And this is said to be through the influence of the Magi, who had their home in Western Iran and were strongly imbued with the civilization of Chaldea and Assyria in which astronomy and astrology play an important part.\n\nSome say the Magi were originally Chaldean priests. They were very powerful during the ascendancy of the Medes; under the Persians, too, they retained their influence to such an extent that Herodotus considered them to form the sixth tribe in the empire, with a sacerdotal capital, independent of the control of the Emperor, like Rome of medi\u00e6val Europe.\n\nThey lost much of their influence during the Greek and Parthian rule of Persia, but under the Sassanides they rose to great power and were organised as a second estate in the realm and were very powerful till the Monarchy and the Church were both swept away in 632 by the Saracen conquest.\n\nDuring this long interval from 600 B.C. to 632 A.D. the Persians twice came into intimate connection with India, once in the 5th Century B.C. and once in the 5th Century A.D.\n\nTheir intimate connection, by conquest, with India in the 5th Century B.C. is attested by various documents discovered by Cunningham and others, and lately by Dr. Stein, in Central Asia, written in their official character, the Kharosthi, written from right to left\u2014the Urdu of those days.\n\nThe story of their intimate relation with Western India in the 5th Century A.D. will be found in the works of Todd and others.\n\nTheir Priesthood must have come into India with them during these two periods, and remained behind after the loss of their political power. Their knowledge of Astrology, etc., entitled them to great respect, and they remained as a part and parcel of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a caste, though in a qualified way.\n\n\u00c7aka-dvipa is generally translated by the word Scythia, i.e., lands unknown to the Hindus, as Scythia was the land unknown to the Greeks. It included every region beyond the ken of the Hindus then and included Iran and Turana alike. So there is no difficulty in finding Persians styled as \u00c7aka-Dvipi by Indians.\n\nI have got a suggestion to make here. Some of these Br\u0101hma\u1e47as call themselves \u00c7aka-dvipi, the others \u00c7akala-dvipi. It appears to me that those who came earlier are known as \u00c7aka-dvipi, and those\nwho came later, i.e., after the Indo-Scythians had established their Capital at \u00c7akala in the Punjab, \u00c7akala-dvipa.\n\nIn this connection, I should like to mention that Vedic Astronomy concerned itself with the determination of time for sacrifices and so it was purely mathematical, but latterly Hindu Astronomy is said to have three branches: Astronomy, Astrology, and Horoscopy. My theory is that Astronomy, as we had in the Vedic times, was a home development; Astrology we got from the Magi, whose descendants are still the Astrologers in India, and Horoscopy has been pronounced by Kern as a Greek art, and I have shown elsewhere that one of the oldest books on Horoscopy is a translation from Greek into Sanskrit.\n## INDEX\n\nTO\n\nPROCEEDINGS, ASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL\n\nFOR 1901.\n\n| Page. | Page. |\n|-------|-------|\n| Abdul Aziz Khan (Maulvie) ... 63 | Buchanan (Major W.
