O'Brien, Esq., C. S. (Ordinary Member).\nMajor-General Sir A. Cunningham, K. C. I. E., C. S. I. (Honorary Member).\n\nDr. A. F. R. Hoernle read an obituary notice of the death of Major-General Sir Alexander Cunningham:\u2014\n\nThe Society has sustained the loss of one of its most distinguished members in the death, on the 28th November last, of Major-General Sir Alexander Cunningham, the news of which was received early in December. He was born in London in 1814, the son of a distin-\nguished father, Allan Cunningham, the Nithsdale poet, and assistant of Chantrey. He was educated at Christ's Church Hospital, and after passing through Addiscombe, obtained his commission as second-lieutenant in the Bengal Engineers in June 1831. From the first he seems to have held good appointments, being on the staff of the Governor-General, Lord William Bentinck in 1834, and afterwards employed on special duty in Oudh. He was no less fortunate in taking part in the hard fighting of those days. He was present at the battle of Punniar, and played a prominent part as field engineer in both of the Sikh wars. In 1846 he was appointed commissioner to demarcate the boundaries of Kashmir on the Tibetan side. During the Mutiny he found himself in Burma, whence he was summoned to be chief engineer in the North-Western Provinces, after the pacification. He retired from active service in 1862. But his connection with India was not yet ended. He now took the lead, officially, of those undertakings, in which he had already been privately engaged for many years, and with which his name will remain prominently and permanently connected. In November 1861, he had laid before Lord Canning a memorandum on the investigation of the archaeological remains of Upper India. This led, early in 1862, to his appointment as Archaeological Surveyor to the Government of India. Though, in a cold fit of parsimony, the department was abolished in 1866, it was fortunately re-established in 1870 in a much more extended form, and General Cunningham, who had spent the intervening period in England, was recalled to be at the head of it as Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India. In this post he served in India till 1885, when he finally retired to England after a total service of more than fifty years.\n\nThe results of the labours of himself and his assistants to the Archaeological Survey were published in twenty-three volumes of reports, to which was added, in a separate volume, a general index, compiled by Mr. V. A. Smith. But these voluminous reports by no means exhausted his energy. Besides numerous contributions to the Journals of this Society and the Numismatic Society of London, he published in 1854, a description of the Bhilsa Topes or Buddhist monuments of Central India, with an account of the opening and examination of the various groups of Topes around Bhilsa, and in 1871 his Ancient Geography of India of which, however, only the first volume has appeared, dealing with the Buddhist period, and including the campaigns of Alexander and the travels of Hiuen Tsiang. In 1877 he brought out\u2014what was again intended to be the first of a series under the title of Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum\u2014an edition of the Inscriptions of Asoka; in 1879, a handsome quarto, with plates, on the Stupa of\nBarhut which he assigned to the third century B.C.; in 1883 a Book of Indian Eras, with tables for the calculation of dates; in 1891 a description of the Coins of Ancient India, dealing with classes of coins that were practically unknown to any one but himself; and in 1893, another handsome quarto, with plates, on the Mahabodhi or the great Buddhist Temple under the bodhi-tree in Buddha-Gaya, which he minutely described from its first foundation under Asoka about B.C. 250.\n\nIt is, however, on his discoveries in a particular branch of archaeology, that Sir Alexander Cunningham's fame will most securely rest. In general archaeology his work was that of a pioneer, and much of it had and will have to be done over again. But in Numismatics he will ever be an undisputed authority. He had made it his especial study, and his experience in it was absolutely unrivalled, and his judgment almost infallible. His contributions to the knowledge of Indian coins, published from time to time, at first in the Journal of this Society and afterward in the Numismatic Chronicle of the Numismatic Society of London, are some of the most valuable on record.\n\nIt does not appear that he ever was an ordinary member of the Society. But through his association with James Prinsep in the latter's memorable discoveries in Indian Epigraphy and Numismatics, he entertained a kind of informal connection with it almost from the beginning. His share in those discoveries is recorded in a number of papers published in the Journal of this Society, the earliest of which \"On some new Bactrian coins\" he contributed in 1840. On the 5th of February 1868 he was elected an Honorary Member of the Society.\n\nTo the last he remained the same indefatigable and devoted student of his favorite subject of Indian Numismatics. Those who had the good fortune of his personal acquaintance will ever remember the ardour of his enthusiasm in that cause, and the generosity of his disposition with which he was always ready to communicate his knowledge and assist fellow-workers. His name will always stand foremost in the honour-roll of those who created and organised Indian Archaeology.\n\nThe Chairman announced that he had received five Essays for the \"Elliott Prize for Scientific Research\" for the year 1893.\n\nThe Secretary reported that Pandit Beni Madho Tribedi had not paid his admission fee, and in accordance with Rule 9 of the Society's Bye-laws his election as a Member of the Society was cancelled.\nDr. Hoernle exhibited a silver coin supposed to be one of Muhammad bin S\u00e1m sent by Mr. Rodgers, and read the following note by the latter:\n\n\"I enclose a coin which I cannot quite make out. You may show it to the Asiatic Society and see what learned men can make out of it. Its weight is 52 grs. and size '85 of an inch. So far as I know it is unique.

I had never read it. I kept it until one of the last and, of course, had to puzzle it out. There is no one here to help me, so the above is my own solution. The coin belongs to Muhammad S\u00e1m I think. But no coin of his at all like this has been hitherto published. The titles are those of this king found on the Qutb at Delhi, except \u0645\u0644\u06a9\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 and \u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 Abul Quhar is new too.\n\n\"Perhaps the Masters of the Madrasah may be able to throw more light on the legends. Could an enlarged photograph of it be made? I think a coin like this is worth some extra trouble.\"\nDr. Hoernle said that he had shown the coin to the Head Manlvi of the Madrasah, who, however, was unable to add anything to Mr. Rodgers' information.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. Tibetan Jails and Criminal Punishment.\u2014By Babu Sarat Chandra Das, C.I.E.\n\nThere are two kinds of jails in Tibet called Zang-tson (mild jail) and Ts'on. The former is prison for light punishment, where the prisoner is provided with food by the State, or by his friends, and the latter is jail proper where the prisoner is not allowed food from the State.\n\nA person suspected of a serious crime or caught red-handed in its perpetration, is sent up to the lock-up which is in the Ts'on or prison. A prisoner suspected of a light guilt is sent to the Zang-tson, and there watched as to his manners and movements. He is at first treated kindly, and interrogations put to him in a kind manner by the investigating officer. When this state has passed away he is subjected to a mild but minute interrogation called Jamti (\u091c\u092e\u094d\u0924\u093f), his depositions called Shu-va (\u0936\u0941\u0935\u093e) being noted down. In the third stage he is subjected to a stricter examination called the Tsan-di (\u0924\u094d\u0938\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940) harsher interrogation, when at intervals he is whipped in the way of a reminder that he has not been telling the truth, or not confessing his guilt. At first five or six stripes are served on him, and then he is again interrogated by the court about his guilt. He who makes any kind of confession, either truly or falsely, is subjected to a prolonged examination and whipping, which generally terminates in tortures. The greatest importance is attached to one's personal confession, evidence being considered of secondary importance in a Tibetan court of trial. The prisoner that makes the least confession, however serious the charges against him, may be, is dealt with rather lightly. The prisoner who confesses his guilt but partly and gradually, is subjected to tortures of various kinds.\n\nTortures\n\nAt Lhasa nowadays, various Chinese tortures are used, besides the national tortures which though rude are simple in their nature.\n\nIn the first instance the prisoner is ordered to walk kneeling on the floor, which is spread over with small, sharp splintered flint or granite. This is called the torture on gravel-bed or karkong (\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0915\u094b\u0902\u0917). When this does not answer well the court tries the torture called Do-shra (\u0926\u094b\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e stone cap), in which a heavy block of stone, of the weight of two to three hundred pounds, with a depression made in it to fit the head of\nthe prisoner, is placed on his head, so that under its crushing weight his brains are pressed out through the sockets of his eyes.\n\nIn serious cases the torture called the Nam-tag, i.e., hanging by the thumbs, is resorted to. The thumbs of the prisoner are tied together by a strong string, the ends of which are fastened to the beam of a house or to a gibbet. Then the supports being removed the prisoner is allowed to swing in the air. When this too fails, he is subjected to the torture called Gyaab Namtag. In this process the prisoner's arms are twisted round on his back, and then his thumbs are tied together to be suspended by a string from the beam of a house. The support being removed, he is let hang. Some bricks one after another are placed on his back, so that his arms may be dislocated under the crushing weight of himself and the bricks.\n\nMabchya-gokor.\u2014This torture is so called on account of the prisoner being required to stand on his breast like a peacock, after his long flowing locks have been tied to his feet, his legs being bent backward like a bow.\n\nThe kind of torture called un-d\u00e9 (un-d\u00e9) at Lhasa and Dang-shol (Dang-shol) in Tsang, consists of two notched wooden racks, in which the legs and feet of the prisoner are fastened to prevent him from struggling to run away or to move under the pain of whipping.\n\nThe torture called Laug-d\u00e9 (Laug-d\u00e9), or fastening of the arms in a notched wooden rack, so that they may not be moved under exertion.\n\nLang-d\u00e9 dah (Lang-d\u00e9 dah), is the kind of torture in which the iron handcuffs of the prisoner are secured to the iron collar which is put round his neck by two short iron rods, about a foot long. This is done to prevent his committing suicide.\n\nThe most excruciating torment called the \"shin-tsi\" is used in very serious cases. In this the finger joints and wrists are cracked by a machine altogether at one time, and the flesh of the fingers is severed out of the bones.\n\nIn Tibetan courts the greatest punishment is given to the prisoner before he is found guilty, in consequence of which people seldom prefer any complaint for redress in a Criminal Court, the plaintiff as well as the defendant are both ruined when involved in criminal cases. The prisoner, after he has been subjected to any of these tortures, is sent to the jail to wait for the sentence. In ordinary cases great delay is made in delivering a judgment. In ninety-nine out of a hundred cases bribes expedite the passing of a decision, diminishing the severity of a sentence.\nIn every serious case in which the Government becomes a party, the court of the Kalons (Ministers) suggests, to the Gyal-tehab, (Regent) which is the highest court of the country, that one of the three punishments mentioned in the decision may be approved of. In a case of murder, dacoity, or high treasons death by drowning, beheading, or strangling is suggested. In a less heinous case, they suggest that the culprit may be blinded, or his hands or legs mutilated. In a still less severe case, the culprit is recommended for imprisonment for life in a dark hole six feet square, called the Po-go-dag-jar, i.e., the cell with but one hole, large enough to throw food inside it; or to be consigned to a prison for life in some remote part of the country, after a collar of wooden board, about 18 inches square has been fixed to his neck and chains put round his legs; or to brand his forehead with a burning seal of steel containing the name \u0f42\u0f7c\u0f0b (dog), this punishment being called \u0f42\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f51\u0f58\u0f0b or dog-seal. The Regent (Gyal-tehab) puts a red mark called Chyag-dags (\u0f46\u0fb1\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f51\u0f42\u0f66\u0f0b) sign manual, or the kind of punishment he approves of, and the culprit is dealt with accordingly. The Regent has not the power of mitigating the sentence, or reversing it, or commuting it, such powers lie with the Dalai Lama himself, who can exercise his mercy on the convict.\n\nAt Lhasa there are two principal jails, called the Naagtse-shar and Dikiling. The former is situated in Lhasa Thil, the middle of the city, and the latter at Potala Sho, i.e., the town at the foot of Potala, the residence of the Dalai Lama. Eight or nine years ago the castle of Panding, about 100 yards from Dikiling, where the mint is now located, was the Jail. In the ground floor of the castle of Dikiling, which is now the residence of the Lord Chancellor (Changoi-chenpo), there are several lime godowns and cells, in some of which prisoners are confined. Some of the cells are only six feet square, called Domkang dub-ths, where prisoners are confined before trial.\n\nNang-tse shar is in fact the Chief Central Jail of Lhasa, where prisoners under trial are put to torture. It is under the supervision of the Mi-pon (\u0f58\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f54\u0f7c\u0f53\u0f0b), the sheriff of Lhasa. The Government does not provide the prisoners with food, but it does not object to food being supplied to them by their relations, friends, and outsiders, who may take pity on them. The Mussalman merchants and traders, both from China and Kashmer, residing at Lhasa, generally send food and eatables to the wretched starving prisoners of Nang-tse shar. Pious pilgrims who happen to visit Lhasa, and religiously disposed people also send them food and money occasionally. Some kind people, occasionally, offer to ransom their lives by paying what is called the life-money or fine.\nAt Shiga-tse there is only one Jail. It is called the Til-bu Tsing-tsing (the house of the ringing bell), on account of the tinkling of the heavy chains and hand-cuffs worn by the prisoners. There are Zang-tson in almost every town and large village where there is a magisterial court. Local life prisoners are not kept in any of these. Life convicts are transferred from one prison to another.\n\nThe custom of sending failing debtors to jail does not prevail in Tibet. Prisoners who are invariably life convicts are not allowed to do any kind of work. In fact there are no short-term prisoners in Tibet. Women, like men, are also sent to jail for the same kind of offences. In many of the prisons where women have been confined with men as life convicts, children have been born and reared.\n\n2. Short Note on the Golden Book of Buddha's Ordination.\u2014By Babu Sarat Chandra Das, C.I.E.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n3. Three documents relating to the History of Ladakh: Tibetan Text, Translation, and Notes.\u2014By the late Dr. Karl Marx, Moravian Missionary at Leh, Ladakh. Communicated by the Philological Secretary.\n\n(Abstract).\n\nThis is a continuation of a paper by Dr. Marx, published in Part I. of the Journal of the Society for 1891. The author died (before that communication was published) at Leh, on the 29th of May 1891, at the early age of 34 years. His lamented death left a serious gap in the ranks of Tibetan scholars. In the former paper the history of Ladakh was carried down to the end of the reign of the 22nd king Senge-man-gyal, and the present one commences with an account of his successor De-lan-nam-gyal and goes down to the beginning of the Dogra invasions in the first quarter of the present century. It has been sent to the Society by the author's brother, the Rev. Dr. Gustaf Dalman of Leipzig. It will be published in full in the Journal, Part I.\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in December last:\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS, AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBatavia.

A. ELLIOTT, K.C.S.I.,\n\nPRESIDENT, in the Chair.\n\nThe following members were present:\u2014\n\nDr. A. W. Alcock, Babu Gyanendra Kumar Rai Chandhuri, Babu Hara Chandra Rai Chandhuri, E. C. Cotes, Esq., Sir A. W. Croft, Babu Sarat Chandra Das, Babu Bhupendra Sri Ghosha, His Grace The Most Rev. Dr. Paul Goethals, G. A. Grierson, Esq., Dr. A. F. R. Hoernle, T. H. Holland, Esq., The Rev. Father E. Lafont, W. A. Lee, Esq., H. Luson, Esq., C. J. Lyall, Esq., J. Mann, Esq., C. R. Marriott, Esq., L. de Nic\u00e9ville, Esq., Mahamahopadhyaya Mahesachandra Nyayaratna, M. H.

Simmons, Esq., Lieutenant F. W. D. Trotter.\n\nAccording to the Bye-Laws of the Society, the President ordered the Voting papers to be distributed for the election of Officers and Members of Council for 1894, and appointed Messrs. E. C. Cotes and M. H. Oung to be Scrutineers.\n\nThe President then called upon the Secretary to read the Annual Report.\n\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1893.\n\nThe Council of the Asiatic Society have the honour to submit the following Report on the state and progress of the Society's affairs during the past year.\nMember List.\n\nDuring the year under review 28 Ordinary Members were elected, 17 withdrew, 8 died, one being a Life Member, 3 were removed from the list under rule 40, being more than 3 years absent from India, and 2 were struck off under rule 9, not having paid their admission fees. The total number of members at the close of 1893, was thus 308 against 310 at the preceding year; of these 116 were Resident, 123 non-Resident, 12 Foreign, 22 Life, 33 absent from India, and 2 Special non-subscribing members, as will be seen from the following table, which also shows the fluctuations in the number of Ordinary Members during the past six years:\n\n| Year | Paying | Non-paying |\n|------|--------|------------|\n|      | Resident | Non-Resident | Foreign | Total | Life | Absent | Special Non-Subscribing | Total | Grand Total |\n| 1888 | ...     | 98         | 136     | 15    | 249   | 20     | 84       | 2       | 56       | 805     |\n| 1889 | ...     | 108        | 135     | 18    | 256   | 22     | 27       | 2       | 51       | 807     |\n| 1890 | ...     | 105        | 140     | 10    | 255   | 21     | 25       | 2       | 48       | 803     |\n| 1891 | ...     | 101        | 134     | 10    | 245   | 21     | 27       | 2       | 50       | 895     |\n| 1892 | ...     | 115        | 127     | 11    | 253   | 22     | 33       | 2       | 57       | 810     |\n| 1893 | ...     | 116        | 123     | 12    | 251   | 22     | 33       | 2       | 57       | 808     |\n\nThe eight Ordinary Members, the loss of whom by death during the year we have to regret, were Nawab Bahadur Abdul Latif Khan, Mr. Henry F. Blanford, Lieutenant-General George Byres Mainwaring, Mr. E. O'Brien, Babu Upendra Chundra Roy, Pandit Haridas Sastri, Maharaja Sir Harendra Kishore Singh, and Mr. James Wood-Mason.\n\nThere were three deaths amongst the Honorary Members, viz., Major-General Sir A. Cunningham, Monsieur E. Renan, and Professor J. O. Westwood. The number now stands at 20.\n\nThe lists of Special Honorary Members, Corresponding Members, and Associate Members, continue unaltered from last year, there having been no casualties. Their numbers stand at 5, 6 and 10, respectively.\n\nDuring the year one member, His Highness the Maharajah Scindia, compounded for his future subscriptions.\n\nIndian Museum.\n\nNo presentations were made over to the Indian Museum.\n\nThe Trustees on behalf of the Society were:\u2014\n\nDr. A. F. R. Hoernle.\nA. Pedler, Esq.\nDr. D. D. Cunningham.\nC. Little, Esq.\nDr. Mahendra Lal Sarkar.\n\nFinance.\n\nThe accounts of the Society are shown in Statement No. 1, in the Appendix under the usual heads.\n\nStatement No. 8, contains the balance sheet of the Society, and of the different funds administered through it.\n\nThe Budget Estimate for 1893, was taken at the following figures:\u2014\nReceipts, Rs. 16,326. Expenditure, Rs. 15,698.\n\nThe actual results were found to be:\u2014Receipts, Rs. 18,270-10-6. Expenditure, Rs. 12,556-13-2.\n\nThe receipts thus show an increase of Rs. 1,944-10-6, and the expenditure a decrease of Rs. 3,141-2-10, on the Budget Estimate, leaving a balance in favor of the Society of Rs. 5,085-13-4.\n\nThe increase in receipts is under the heads of \"Subscriptions\" and \"Government Allowance.\" \"Subscriptions\" were estimated at Rs. 7,400, whilst the actual sum was Rs. 8,307-5-0, the increase being due to some of the arrear subscriptions from Members having been realized. \"Government Allowance\" shows an increase of Rs. 1,500. During the year Rs. 1,000 was received from the Government of North-Western Provinces, as a contribution to the Society's Journal, Part I, for the publication of Mr. Hoey's paper on \"S\u0113t Mah\u0113t,\" of which 150 copies were sent to them, and Rs. 500 from the Government of Madras towards the publication of Part III of the Society's Journal.\n\nMessrs. Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner and Company, have not submitted their accounts, and thus there appears a reduction of Rs. 118-5-6 under the head of \"Sale of publications.\" \"Rent of Rooms\" is also below the estimate, but this is due to the non-receipt of rent, the Treasurer of the Photographic Society having been away from Calcutta, during the two last months of the year.\n\nOn the expenditure side, the items of \"Commission,\" \"Contingencies,\" \"Journal, Part I,\" and \"Printing Circulars,\" etc., show an increase. The first was due to the arrear subscriptions realized. No extraordinary expenditure was contemplated during the year, and Rs. 150 were set aside for contingent charges. But during the year it was found necessary to purchase scales for numismatic purposes, waterproofs for peons, Secretaries' despatch boxes, etc., and to pay Rs. 102 for professional opinion on the question of the Society's boundary wall, and hence Rs. 321-7-3 was spent under this heading. The Budget Estimate\nfor Journal, Part I, has been exceeded by Rs. 983-1-6, a sum which is more than covered by the special grant from the Government of North-Western Provinces for the publication of Mr. Hoey's paper on \"S\u00eat Mah\u00eat.\" Owing to a new edition of the Society's Bye-laws being printed, there is a slight increase of Rs. 36-12-0, under the head of \"Printing Circulars,\" etc.\n\nAn expenditure of only Rs. 242-7-0 appears under the head \"Books,\" in consequence of the non-receipt of Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner and Co.'s accounts, the books purchased through our London agents amounting to \u00a371-16-5.\n\nOwing to extensive repairs to the Society's buildings and to the complete change of gas fittings, the accounts show an extraordinary expenditure of Rs. 9,674-1-3, a sum which is below the estimate.\n\nThe actual expenditure on the Journal and Proceedings was as follows:\n\n|                | Re. A. P. |\n|----------------|-----------|\n| Journal        |           |\n| Part I.        | ...       | 3,083 1 6 |\n| Part II.       | ...       | 1,876 3 6 |\n| Part III.      | ...       | 212 1 2   |\n| Proceedings    | ...       | 902 4 0   |\n| Total          | ...       | 5,573 10 3 |\n\nThis is less than the Budget Estimate by Rs. 1,626-5-10, but the bills for the printing of Part III, during the past year have not yet been submitted.\n\nThe Budget Estimate of ordinary receipts and expenditure for 1894 has been fixed as follows:\u2014Receipts, Rs. 17,576. Expenditure, Rs. 16,993.\n\nOn the receipts side, there is an increase under the head of \"Government Allowances\" owing to grants of Rs. 1,000 and of Rs. 500 made by Governments of Assam and Madras, respectively, for Part III of the Society's Journal dealing with Anthropology, Ethnology and Folk-lore. The estimate for \"Miscellaneous Receipts\" has been reduced by Rs. 250 as the sum actually received under this heading was little more than Rs. 100 during the past year.\n\nOn the expenditure side the items \"Stationery,\" \"Postage,\" \"Freight,\" \"Contingencies,\" \"Journal, Part III,\" and \"Printing Circulars,\" &c., have been increased. \"Stationery\" has been increased by Rs. 50, owing to the compilation of Society's Library Catalogue. The item of postage has been increased by Rs. 50. This will cover the despatch of those numbers of the Journal of 1893 which have been\nrecently issued. \"Freight\" has been slightly increased owing to the continental agency.\n\nThere will, however, be an extraordinary item of expenditure for the year 1894 on account of Part I of the Journal.\n\nThe details of the Budget Estimate are as follows:\n\n**Receipts**\n\n| Description            | Amount |\n|------------------------|--------|\n| Subscriptions          | Rs. 7,400 0 0 |\n| Sales of Publications  | Rs. 400 0 0 |\n| Interests on Investments | Rs. 5,456 0 0 |\n| Rent of Rooms          | Rs. 720 0 0 |\n| Government Allowances   | Rs. 3,500 0 0 |\n| Miscellaneous           | Rs. 100 0 0 |\n\nTotal Rs. ... 17,576 0 0\n\n**Expenditure**\n\n| Description            | Amount |\n|------------------------|--------|\n| Salaries               | Rs. 3,400 0 0 |\n| Commission             | Rs. 400 0 0 |\n| Pension                | Rs. 48 0 0 |\n| Stationery             | Rs. 150 0 0 |\n| Lighting               | Rs. 50 0 0 |\n| Municipal Taxes        | Rs. 819 0 0 |\n| Postage                | Rs. 650 0 0 |\n| Freight                | Rs. 15 0 0 |\n| Meeting                | Rs. 80 0 0 |\n| Contingencies          | Rs. 200 0 0 |\n| Books *                | Rs. 1,800 0 0 |\n| Local Periodicals      | Rs. 31 0 0 |\n| Binding                | Rs. 500 0 0 |\n| Journal, Part I        | Rs. 2,100 0 0 |\n| \" Part II              | Rs. 2,100 0 0 |\n| \" Part III             | Rs. 3,500 0 0 |\n| Proceedings            | Rs. 1,000 0 0 |\n| Printing Circulars, &c.| Rs. 150 0 0 |\n\nTotal Rs. ... 16,993 0 0\n\n* In addition to Rs. 480 which remains unexpended from the grant of last year.\nEXTRAORDINARY EXPENDITURE.\n\nFor printing the remaining portion of Major Raverty's article on the \"Mihran of Sind and its Tributaries.\" ... Rs. 1,265 0 0\n\nPress Bills for Journal, Part I, Nos. 2-3 of 1893. ... Rs. 856 0 0\n\nTotal Rs. 2,121 0 0\n\nLondon Agency.\n\nMessrs. Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner and Co., not having submitted their accounts with the Society during the year, nothing can be said about the sales made by them of the Society's publications, or of the amount due to or by the Society. No remittance was made to them during the year.\n\nThe number of copies of parts of the Journals, of the Proceedings, and of the Bibliotheca Indica sent to the Agents during 1893 for sale, were 308, 110, and 178, valued @ \u00a3 48-1-6d., \u00a3 8-5-0d., and Rs. 106-4-0, respectively.\n\nSeven invoices of books purchased and of publications of various Societies sent in exchange were received during the year. The value of the books purchased amounted to \u00a3 71-16-5.\n\nContinental Agency.\n\nMr. Otto Harrassowitz, Bookseller, Leipzig, newly appointed by the Council as agent to the Society, received during the year, 299 copies of Journals, 273 copies of Proceedings, 843 copies of Bibliotheca Indica valued @ \u00a3 44-17-0d., \u00a3 9-11-8\u00bdd., and Rs. 483-8-0, respectively, and the other books for sale amounting to Rs. 69-8-0.\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe total number of volumes or parts of volumes added to the library during the year was 2,053, of which 660 were purchased and 1,393 presented or received in exchange for the Society's publications.\n\nA new edition of the Society's Library Catalogue has been taken in hand and the compilation has been entrusted to the Assistant Secretary of the Society.\n\nPublications.\n\nThere were published during the year, ten numbers of the Proceedings (No. 10 of 1892 and Nos. 1 to 9 of 1893) containing 210 pages of letter-press; four numbers of the Journal, Part I (No. 4 of 1892 and\nNos. 1 to 3 of 1893) containing 381 pages of letter-press and 9 plates; four numbers of the Journal, Part II (No. 3 of 1892, Nos. 1 to 3 of 1893) containing 264 pages of letter-press, and 13 plates; two numbers of the Journal, Part III (Nos. 1 and 2 of 1893), containing 94 pages of letter-press; an extra number of the Journal, Part I for 1892, containing 64 pages of letter-press and 30 plates. Indexes to the Journal, Parts I and II for 1892, were also published.\n\nBuilding.\n\nAlthough Rs. 2,428 was spent on the building in 1887, extensive repairs were found necessary during the year. They were carried out by Messrs. Mackintosh Burn & Co., at a cost of Rs. 9,674-1-8.\n\nAnthropology.\n\nIn August 1892, the Monthly General Meeting resolved that a third section dealing with Anthropology, Ethnography and Folk-lore, should be added to the Society's Journal, and that the Council should be authorized to enter into negotiations with the Government of Bengal in order to obtain a grant in connection therewith. An application was addressed to the Government of Bengal, and they were pleased to sanction a grant of Rs. 2,000 a year for the purpose of enabling the Asiatic Society of Bengal to add such a third section to their Journal. During the year 1893, the Government of Assam sanctioned a grant of Rs. 1,000 a year and the Government of Madras Rs. 500 for the two official years 1893\u201394 and 1894\u201395, for the same purpose.\n\nElliott Prize for Scientific Research.\n\nDuring the year 1892, the Hon'ble Sir Charles Elliott created an endowment for the encouragement of original research in Physical Science in Bengal and for this purpose invested the sum of Rs. 5,000 in Government 4 per cent. promissory notes, yielding an annual return of Rs. 200. The scheme proposed was that a prize should be awarded from the annual sum received as interest, whether in cash, or partly in the form of a gold medal and partly in cash, for any original essay giving the result of original research or investigation in any branch of Physical, Chemical, Mathematical or Natural Science. The Trustees appointed to administer the property were the President of the Asiatic Society, the Vice-Chancellor of the Calcutta University, and the Director of Public Instruction, Bengal.\n\nThe Council of the Asiatic Society have authorized the President to act as a Trustee, and have agreed to the prize being awarded at the Annual General Meeting.\nCoin Cabinet.\n\nDuring the year 71 Coins were added to the Society's Cabinet, of which 6 were of gold mixed with some other metal; 39 were of silver and 26 of copper. They belong to the following classes: Bactrian (Apollodotus) 8, Kaninda 5, Andhra 13, Chedi 6, Pathan 13, Bengal (independent Sultans) 7, Moghul 16, Kuch Bihar 4, Jayantipur 1, Assam 1, Nepal 2. Under the Treasure Trove Act were acquired 63 of these coins; viz., 59 through the Governments of the Bengal Presidency, and 4 through the Government of Bombay. 8 coins were presented by Mr. E. A. Gait, C.S. With the exception of the Andhra and Chedi coins, they all belong to well-known types, and detailed notices of them are published in the Society's Proceedings for March, June and August, 1893.\n\nOffice of Secretaries.\n\nMr. G. A. Grierson carried on the duties of Philological Secretary and Editor of the Journal, Part I, during the year, except for three months from August to October, when he was absent on leave, and Dr. A. F. R. Hoernle took charge of the work.\n\nPandit Hara Prasad Sastri continued Joint Philological Secretary throughout the year.\n\nDr. J. H. Tull Walsh carried on the duties of Natural History Secretary and Editor of the Journal, Part II, throughout the year.\n\nThe Hon'ble Mr. H. H. Risley carried on the duties of the Anthropological Secretary and Editor of the Journal, Part III, during the year.\n\nDr. W. King carried on the duties of Treasurer up to August when he resigned, and Mr. C. Little was appointed in his place.\n\nMr. C. R. Wilson carried on the duties of the General Secretary and Editor of the Proceedings during the year, except for two months, May and June, when he was absent on leave, and Dr. J. H. Tull Walsh took charge of the work in addition to his duties as Natural History Secretary to the Society.\n\nMr. J. H. Elliott continued Assistant Secretary and Librarian throughout the year.\n\nThere were no changes in the posts of Assistant Librarian, Cashier, Pandit and Copyist which were held by the permanent incumbents, Babu Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee, Babu Nritya Gopal Bose, Pandit Hari Mohan Vidhyabhushan and Babu Nani Lall Manna.\n\nBibliotheca Indica.\n\nNine fasciculi were issued during the year, of which one is in the Arabic-Persian, seven in the Sanskrit, and one in the Tibetan Series.\nThey belong to eight different works, two fasciculi being issued for one Sanskrit work only, namely the Tattva Cint\u0101ma\u1e47i. Only two works came to a close, namely, the Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a and the Madana-P\u0101rij\u0101ta.\n\nThe Philological Secretary exercised complete control over the publication. No new fasciculus was taken in hand without his sanction. The result of this vigilance has been the liquidation of old debts and the restoration of the solvency of the Fund. By the middle of the year it was found that the Society was in a position to commence new publications, at least, some of those that were stopped for want of funds. But it was also recognised that care should be taken not to overdo the work and not to fall into debt. At the suggestion of the President, therefore, a Budget was prepared by the Philological Committee, and the Secretary was asked to strictly adhere to the Budget. The Budget included the names of publications taken in hand, the names of publications which would be taken in hand as soon as funds were available, and the names of publications approved and sanctioned. Any new work when sanctioned should be first entered into the third list and should gradually rise to the first and be taken in hand.\n\nThe expenditure of the Oriental Publication Fund during the year 1893 is Rs. 7,831-6-0, which includes the printing charges for 16, and editing charges for 14, fasciculi, giving the average of Rs. 522 for each fasciculus. This leaves a balance of Rs. 5,571-15-11 to the credit of the Fund at the end of the year.\n\nThe following is a descriptive list of the publications issued during 1893:\n\nA. ARABIC-PERSIAN SERIES.\n\n1. \u0100in-i-Akbar\u012b, the constitutional history of the Mughal Empire in Akbar's time by Ab\u016b-l-fa\u017cl, one of the most learned men of his court.

The same\npatron of letters got a Vaidyaka work similarly compiled in his court. That work also was named after himself like this. It has been called Madana-Bin\u015bda-Nighan\u1e6du. He flourished about the middle of the fourteenth century of the Christian era.\n\n3. Var\u0101ha Pur\u0101\u1e47a under the editorship of Pandit Hrishike\u015ba S\u0101str\u012b, one of the Junior Professors of the same College, advanced by one fasciculus No. 829, Fasc. XIV. The work comes to a close in this fasciculus.\n\n4. Tattva-Chint\u0101ma\u1e47i, the standard work on the Ny\u0101ya Philosophy in Bengal, composed seven hundred years ago in Mithil\u0101 by G\u0101\u1e45g\u0113\u015ba Up\u0101dhy\u0101ya, has advanced by two fasciculi, Nos. 830 and 832, Vol. III, Fascs.

E., Tibetan Translator to Government, and Pandit Harimohan Vidy\u0101bh\u016bshan, Oriental Librarian of the Asiatic Society. The work is so printed that one page contains the Tibetan metrical translation and the other the Sanskrit text. It has been so designed to help the study of Tibetan through the medium of Sanskrit. The work was composed in K\u0101shmir during the eleventh century by the poet named Kshemendra, and is now the Standard Buddhist work in Tibet, read both in original and in translation.\nList of all

Crooke was asked if he would be willing to act temporarily as Anthropological Secretary.\nIn reply to a letter of enquiry the Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Public Works Department, was informed, that the Asiatic Society was not in a position to afford any definite opinion as to the extent in India generally, and in Bengal especially, of the untouched epigraphical work which should be undertaken by official agency, nor as to the period for which such agency should be maintained; nor had the Society any agency to collect and record information on the subject. They believed, however, that there were sufficient epigraphical materials to fully employ two whole-time epigraphical officers for a number of years, one for the North Indian area and the other for South India.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Natural History Secretary, a copy of the new edition of J. H\u00fcbner's \"Sammlung Exotischer Schmetterlinge,\" was ordered to be purchased for the Library.\n\nThe appointment of Babu Sarat Chunder Biswas on Rs. 13 for six months for the purpose of putting the stock in order, was sanctioned.\n\nWith reference to a suggestion of Colonel H.

Constable and Co., and to circulate them to Council for approval, together with the existing terms with Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner and Co.\n\nA letter from the Hon'ble Mr. H. H. Risley to the effect that he had withdrawn Pt. III, No. 1, of the Society's Journal and completely re-arranged the matter, was recorded.\n\nThe list of petty charges submitted by the Baptist Mission Press, not formally accepted by the Society, was referred to the Finance Committee.\n\nIt was agreed at the suggestion of the General Secretary that Dr. A. W. Alcock should be offered a seat on the Council of the Society in the place of Mr. E. C. Cotes, resigned.\n\nIt was agreed to lend \"Maitr\u0101ya\u1e47i \u00c7akh\u0101\" and \"M\u0101nava \u00c7ulva S\u016btra,\" two Sanskrit Manuscripts, to Prof. Dr. F.

Lethierry and G. Severin, was ordered to be purchased for the Library.\n\nOn the recommendation of the General Secretary the purchase of a copy of Major-General Malcolm's \"Life of Lord Clive\" for the Library was agreed to.\n\nMr. G. A. Grierson returned from leave and relieved Dr. Hoernle of the Philological Secretaryship to the Society.\n\nDecember 28th, Ordinary Meeting.\n\nWith reference to the request of the President of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Science that the Asiatic Society of Bengal should memorialize the Government for the transmission of objects of Natural History to the Union countries at the rate of 'samples of merchandise,' and not at 'letter rates,' which are ten times greater than those of samples of merchandise, it was resolved to forward a copy of the Circular to the Trustees of the Indian Museum, with an intimation that if they were of opinion that a memorial should be framed, the Asiatic Society was willing to co-operate.\n\nA letter from the Hon'ble Major E. Noel, to the effect that he must give up the translation of the \"Muntakhabu-t-Taw\u0101rikh\" for the Bibliotheca Indica, as he was going on a year's leave to England, and may not return to India, was referred to the Philological Committee.\n\nDr. A. W. Alcock's acceptance of the seat on the Council of the Society was recorded.\n\nThe acknowledgment from Professor Dr. R. Semon of the sum of\n\u00a35-11-7, subscribed by the members of the Asiatic Society towards the Haeckel Memorial Bust was recorded.\n\nThe question of filling up of the vacancies in the Honorary Membership of the Society caused by the deaths of the late Professor Westwood, and Monsieur Renan, deferred at the July Meeting of Council, was ordered to be circulated to the Council with the previous papers, and a list of the present Honorary Members.\n\nWith reference to an offer from Mr. B. D\u00e9, to edit the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i-Rashidi for the Bibliotheca Indica, it was resolved that the proposal should be considered when drawing up the Bibliotheca Indica Budget for next year.\n\nThe question of publishing the remaining portion of Major Raverty's article on \"The Mihr\u0101n of Sind and its Tributaries,\" was referred to the Finance Committee.\n\nWith reference to letters from the Superintendent of the Baptist Mission Press dealing with the subject of the Anthropological portion of the Society's Journal, and enclosing copies of instructions received from the Hon'ble Mr. Risley, it was resolved to ask Dr. A. W. Alcock to take up the work of the Anthropological Secretaryship, and to inform Mr. Risley that, finding difficulties in the arrangement suggested by him, the Council had recommended Dr. Alcock to be elected Anthropological Secretary for the ensuing year under rule 44.\n\nThe Report having been read the President invited the meeting to put any questions or to offer any remarks which any member might think necessary in connection therewith.\n\nNo remarks having been offered, the President moved the adoption of the Report. The motion was carried unanimously.\n\nThe President then read the Report of the Trustees of the \"Elliott Prize for Scientific Research.\"\n\nReport on the \"Elliott Prize for Scientific Research.\"\n\nThe Trustees have received essays from the following competitors for the prize:\n\n(1.) Babu Asutosh Mukhop\u00e1dhy\u00e1ya, M. A., F. R. S. E. (three essays):\n\n(a) On an application of differential equations to the theory of plane cubics;\n\n(b) Researches on the number of normals common to two surfaces, two curves, or a curve and a surface;\n\n(c) On the application of Gauss' theory of curvature to the evaluation of double integrals.\n(2.) Babu Jn\u00e1n Saran Chakravarti, Student, Presidency College:\u2014\nA chapter on the general equation of the second degree.\n\n(3.) Babu Brajendranath Seal, M.A., Principal, Berhampore College.\nNew methods of determining some fundamental definite integrals, being a chapter in the integral calculus; with an introductory section containing new formul\u00e6 for the summation of series, together with their applications.\n\n(4.) \"S. L. S.\" Student, Presidency College:\u2014\nA deduction of the properties of prime and composite numbers from those of recurring decimals and their equivalents in other scales of notation.\n\n(5.) Babu Chandra Kanta Basu (Sub-Overseer, Madaripur):\u2014\nMathematical investigations, and their practical applications, if possible, for the determination of a sound-generating spot, where sonorous vibrations commence and afterwards produce the sensation of sound, from the data of observed differences of times in which the same report is heard from several places fixed in position.\n\nThe Trustees, after consulting experts, as provided in the scheme, adjudge the prize for the year 1893, to Babu Chandra Kanta Basu, Sub-Overseer, Madaripur (No. 5, in the foregoing list.)\n\nC. A. Elliott.\nA. Croft. { Trustees.\n\nCalcutta, the 31st January, 1894.\n\nThe President also read a short account of Babu Chandrakanta Basu's paper, kindly furnished by Mr. A. M. Nash.\n\nSome years ago a Committee was appointed by the Asiatic Society of Bengal, to investigate the causes of the natural phenomenon commonly known as the \"Barisal Guns\", but owing to the insufficiency of the information on the subject, no definite conclusion could be arrived at. It is clear that if the spot from which the sounds originate could be accurately determined, the difficulty of the investigation would be materially lessened, and this is the problem which the writer has attempted to solve. The principle upon which he has based his solution is the following:\u2014\n\nAssuming that the velocity of sound is known and constant, if the same sound is heard at two different places, the difference between the distances of those places from the spot where the sound originated can be calculated, being equal to the velocity of sound\nmultiplied by the difference between the times observed. From the well-known property of the hyperbola that the difference between the focal distances of any point of the curve is constant, it follows that the sound must come from some point of a hyperbola having the two observing stations as its foci, or, if allowance be made for the curvature of the earth's surface, from some point of a hyperboloid of revolution. When there are several observing stations, each pair of stations gives a definite locus for the origin of the sound, and if the point common to all these loci can be determined, this point must be the one required.\n\nIt is unnecessary to enter into the details of calculations necessary for the determination of this common point, which are given at considerable length in the essay. The writer has also given the modifications of the calculation caused by the variations of the velocity of sound and other causes.\n\nBabu Chandrakanta Basu being present in the meeting, the President presented him with the medal and prize money, adding a few words of congratulation and encouragement.\n\nThe President then delivered an address.\n\n(The Address has been printed separately from the Proceedings).\n\nA cordial vote of thanks was proposed by Sir A. W. Croft to the Hon. Sir C. A. Elliott for his address and for his services to the Society, which was carried by acclamation.\n\nThe President announced that the Scrutineers reported the result of the Election of Officers and Members of Council to be as follows:\n\nPresident:\nC. J. Lyall, Esq., M.A., L.L.D., C.S.I., C.I.E.\n\nVice-Presidents:\nDr. A. F. R. Hoernle,\nSir A. W. Croft, M.A., K.C.I.E.\nThe Hon. Sir C. A. Elliott, K.C.S.I.\n\nSecretaries and Treasurer:\nG. A.

Jarrett.\nDr. Mahendralal Sarkar, C.I.E.\nColonel J. Waterhouse, B.S.C.\nThe Hon. Mr. Justice Amir Ali, C.I.E.\nMahamahopadhyaya Mahesachandra Nyayaratna, C.I.E.\nA. Pedler, Esq., F.R.S.\nDr. W. J. Simpson.\nJ. Mann, Esq., M.A.\n\nThe meeting was then resolved into the Ordinary General Meeting.\n\nC. J. Lyall, Esq., M.A., LL.D., C.S.I., C.I.E.,\nPresident, in the Chair.\n\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nSixty-six Presentations were announced, details of which are given in the Library List appended.\n\nThe following gentlemen are candidates for election at the next Meeting:\u2014\n\nHis Highness Raja Vishwanath Singh, Bahadur, Chief of Chhaturpur, proposed by V. A. Smith, Esq., seconded by C. R. Wilson, Esq.\n\nW. M. Osmond, Esq., proposed by T. H. Holland, Esq., seconded by C. R. Wilson, Esq.\n\nThe Council reported that in consequence of the deaths of Monsieur E. Renan, Professor J. O. Westwood, Major-General Sir A. Cunningham, Dr. Aloys Sprenger, Dr. Warner Siemens, Professor H. Milne-Edwards, there were now eight vacancies in the list of the Honorary Members. The Council therefore recommended the seven following gentlemen for election as Honorary Members at the next Meeting:\u2014\n\nSir William Henry Flower, the present Director of the Natural History Departments of the British Museum, who as Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy in the Royal College of Surgeons distinguished himself by his researches on the Comparative Anatomy and Osteology of the Mammalia, especially of the Whales. His work on the homologies and succession of the teeth of mammalia is classical, as is his \"Introduction to the Osteology of the Mammalia.\" Sir William Flower is also well known as one of the leaders of the modern anthropometric school of exact Anthropology.\n\nDr. Edward Frankland, D.C.L., F.R.S., &c., one of the leading English Chemists, who by his researches has largely helped to place\nthe science of Modern Chemistry in its present position. His discoveries have been made in the various branches of Pure, Physical, Applied and Analytical Chemistry. By his isolation of the Alcohol Radicals (Ethyl was isolated in 1848), he not only did much to establish the Theory of Radicals on a sound basis, but also from his theoretical reasoning on these bodies, and from other similar researches on the Organo-Metallic bodies, he was able to lay the foundation of the Modern Theory of Atomicity. Indeed Frankland may be said to have been the originator of the doctrine of the saturation capacity of elementary atoms. Shortly after he had isolated the radicals, he also by his discovery of the Organo-Metallic bodies placed a new and most powerful instrument of research in the hands of Chemists, and was able to utilise this method himself in the discovery of many new substances, and in the determination of the constitution of many classes of compounds. Amongst his many investigations, the synthetical researches on the acids of the fatty or acetic series, on the lactic series, and on the acrylic series, are most valuable. Indeed his researches in these directions were not only most prolific in themselves, but they also pointed the way to the discovery of vast numbers of other new substances in the hands of other Chemists.\n\nIn his researches on Physical Chemistry, he has put forward an entirely new theory as to the source of light in luminous flames, and as to the influence of varying atmospheric pressure on combustion. Also in conjunction with Mr. Lockyer, he published many papers, and made many discoveries with reference to the Chemistry and the Physical conditions of the Sun's Atmosphere.\n\nIn Applied and Analytical Chemistry he invented an improved apparatus for the analysis of gases, and in the case of water analysis he revolutionized the whole process, and placed it upon a sound basis. As a member of the River's Pollution Commission, too, his contributions to our knowledge of methods of treatment of sewage, and foul waste-liquids from factories, &c., which liquids were formerly allowed to pollute the running streams in Great Britain, have been most valuable.\n\nIn addition to the above summary of his work in Chemistry, it may be mentioned that he has contributed largely to our knowledge on such various subjects as \"The Source of Muscular Power,\" \"Measurement of Solar Intensity,\" \"The Physical Cause of the Glacial Epoch,\" &c., &c.\n\nMonsieur Louis Pasteur, to whose world-wide reputation\u2014a reputation based as much upon his wonderful biological discoveries as upon his own remarkable application of them for the benefit of mankind\u2014it is almost superfluous to refer.\n\nHaving early achieved the highest distinction as a chemist, and then approaching Biology from the chemical side, M. Pasteur made his\nname for ever illustrious by his masterly researches into, and luminous interpretations of the phenomena of the zymotic diseases of living beings. To the genius of M. Pasteur we owe the great and prolific generalization that the chemico-vital changes that constitute zymotic disease are, in principle, fermentations,\u2014the recognition and application of which forms the largest and most promising volume of the pathological researches of these times.\n\nM. Pasteur's own practical applications of his own fertile generalization are too numerous to relate: those which saved the silk-worm industry of Europe; those which practically abolished anthrax as a fatal epidemic; and those which promise to deprive hydrophobia of its terrors, are historic.\n\nSir George Gabriel Stokes, Bart., F.R.S., &c., who after a most distinguished academical career, at once turned his attention to original investigation, and in the course of a very few years had achieved such success that the President of the Royal Society, when awarding the Rumford Medal forty-two years ago, expressed himself as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Your discoveries in Physical Optics during the last few years, which have shown in so striking a manner the powers of analysis in bringing the abstruse phenomena of light within the domain of theory, have been crowned by a discovery even more important. That the refrangibility of light should be actually changed by dispersion within certain media, and that the invisible rays of the spectrum should thus be rendered visible, is a discovery as curious, perhaps as important, as any to be found in the recent history of Optical Science.\"\n\nThe hope at the same time expressed that a career commenced so brilliantly might be distinguished by other discoveries has not been belied. Mr. Stokes continued his never-ceasing labours, and published many original papers in various Journals. It is impossible to give briefly a sketch of these papers, but a large proportion of them dealt with subjects connected with Light, Sound, and Hydro-dynamics.\n\nMah\u00e1mahop\u00e1dhy\u00e1ya Chandrak\u00e1nta Tark\u00e1lankar, in recognition of his eminent services to Sanskrit learning. He is well known to scholars in Europe for his learned publications, as he is to scholars in India. He has written some original works in Sanskrit, such as the Mah\u00e1k\u00e1vyas, Satipari\u015baya and Candravam\u015ba, and the Drama, Kaumudi Sudh\u0101kara, and likewise several commentaries on ancient Sanskrit works, such as the Gobhi\u015ba Grihyas\u016btra, the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika Dar\u00e7ana, and the Kusum\u0101\u00f1jali. Some of the Society's publications, too, have been learnedly edited by him, and he is the author, besides, of a Bengali prose work called \u00c7iksha. In consideration of his high Sanskrit scholarship, the Government of India has conferred on him the title of Mah\u00e1mahop\u00e1dhy\u00e1ya.\nProfessor Theodor Noeldeke of the University of Strassburg, one of the most distinguished Arabists of Germany\u2014perhaps, since the death of H. Fleischer, H. Thorbecke, and August M\u00fcller, the most distinguished\u2014, the author of numerous works dealing with the language, literature, religion and history of the Arabs. But he is not only celebrated as an Arabist. In Syriac also he is one of the chief authorities in Europe, and has explored the many dialects of that widely spread form of Semitic speech, of which his grammars are the standard authority for the Mandean, or language of the Gnostics or Sabians of the Kur\u2019an, the northern or Edessan Syriac, the Palmyrene of the inscriptions of Tadmur, and the dialects spoken by the Christians of Palestine. In the Pahlavi of the Sasanian kings also he has greatly advanced our knowledge, and has edited a work in that language, one of the few remnants of the literature which was swept away by the Muhammadan conquest, containing a romance or legendary history dealing with Ardashir Papakan, the founder of the Sasanian dynasty.\n\nDr. Reinhold Rost, the late Librarian of the India Office, a post from which he retired a few months ago after an incumbency of 24 years, who is regarded with respect and affection throughout the entire world of Oriental studies. Himself the most many-sided student in all branches of that department of learning\u2014even the most remote, such as the dialects of Indo-China and the vast tract occupied by the Malay languages on the one side, and the Swahili of the African coast on the other\u2014he has been always ready to place his great stores of knowledge at the service of other members of the craft, and to help forward the advancement of science wherever he found an opportunity. Yet, though his favourite studies lay in somewhat out-of-the-way regions, he has by no means neglected the better-known fields of Oriental letters, and he has long since won his place among solid scholars in Sanskrit.\n\nHe has been honoured by the University of Oxford with his honorary degree of M.A., by that of Edinburgh with the degree of LL.D., and by the Government with the Companionship of the Indian Empire. The members of this Society, in whose work he has always felt the warmest interest, recognize that in enrolling him among their Honorary Members they are doing no less honour to themselves than to him.\n\nThe following gentlemen have expressed a wish to withdraw from the Society:\u2014\n\nMoulvie Golam Sarwar.\nRai Bahadur Dhanapati Singh, Dugher.\nR. Sewell, Esq., C.S.\nThe Secretary reported the death of the following Honorary Members:\n\nDr. Aloys Sprenger.\nDr. Warner Siemens.\nProfessor H.

(Retd.)\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis account of Gaur was a report submitted to the Court of Directors in the year 1812, by Major Francklin, entitled \"Journal...\"\nof a route from R\u00e1jmah\u00e1l to Gaur, A.D. 1810\u201d\u2014By Major William Francklin, Regulating Officer at Bh\u00e1galpur.\n\nThe author was, like Warren Hastings and Impey, a Westminster boy, and was an officer in the army of the East India Company. He was the son of a Clergyman named Thomas Francklin, who was a man of some note in the Literary world, but who, unfortunately, got confounded with his more celebrated namesake, Benjamin Franklin. Macaulay corrects the mistake, and impales his unoffending countryman on the point of a Greek epigram. The son is well known as the Biographer of George Thomas, and as the author of a work on the site of Palibothra, in which he endeavours to identify that city with Champ\u00e1nagar, near Bh\u00e1galpur. But the most picturesque circumstance in his life was a tour which he made in Persia in 1786, when he was an ensign and only three-and-twenty years of age. On this occasion he lived for about six months at Shir\u00e1z as a member of a Persian family. He became Major in 1810, and a Lieut.-Col. in 1814. For some years he was Regulating Officer of Bh\u00e1galpur. Bishop Heber met him at that station so late as 1824, and describes him as being a very agreeable and communicative old man, and as the possessor of curious and interesting collections. Francklin retired from the service in 1825, and died in April 1839 at the age of 76. At the time of his death he was Librarian to the R.A.S.\n\nThe existence of the report was first brought to notice in late years by Mr. Grote, who recommended Mrs. Ravenshaw to utilise it in editing her husband\u2019s work on Gaur. Afterwards Mr. Grote took upon himself the task of annotation, and added many notes from Francklin to Ravenshaw\u2019s text. A few years ago, our Society applied to the India Office for the MS., with the view of printing it, if this should seem worth while. The Secretary of State for India referred the matter to Dr. Burgess, who gave it as his opinion that all the valuable information in Francklin\u2019s report had been already extracted by Mr. Grote, and, in consequence, the MS. was not sent to our Society.\n\nSince then Mr. Beveridge has examined it and compared it with Ravenshaw\u2019s Gaur, and agrees with Dr. Burgess. He therefore cannot recommend that it should be published, though it does seem hard that a report submitted to the Court of Directors in 1812, should have been neglected till 1878, and then be superseded by the pith of it being put into another\u2019s book.\n\nMr. Beveridge then discusses various points of detail in regard to Gaur, touched on by Major Francklin. The most interesting fact noted is that the Chronological Table of the Muhammadan rulers of Gaur, and the Historical Memorandum about them given by Buchanan Hamilton, and reproduced in Montgomery Martin\u2019s \u201cEastern India,\u201d are word for\nword the same as a similar Table and Memorandum given by Major Francklin. An examination of the Buchanan MSS. shows that he obtained his copies from that gentleman. Francklin tells us that they are translated from some MS. materials procured through the kindness of Mr. Ellerton, of the Indigo Factory at Goomaki, near Gaur, whom he describes in terms of old-world courtesy as \"a gentleman who unites business with service and love of the arts, and whose polite hospitality to us during our stay at his mansion entitles him to every consideration and thanks.\"\n\nThe paper will be published in full in the Journal, Pt.

Pedler, Esq., F.R.S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nOf late years a belief has been gaining ground in Calcutta, Bombay, and in many other important towns in India\u2014not apparently without reason\u2014that wholesale adulteration is practised in many of the common articles of diet, notably in ghee, butter, milk, mustard oil, &c. The present investigation was undertaken with a view to throw some light on these points, and it embodies the result of the work carried on at intervals during the last four years.\n\nPRELIMINARY.\n\nAs butter largely enters into the dietary of the people of Europe and America, abundant work has been done by Chemists on its analysis. It is, however, well known that the composition of milk and of the butter made from it is, within certain limits, dependent on the breed, climate, method of feeding the cows, period of lactation and so on; the standard for genuine butter, as generally accepted in England, especially at Somerset House, cannot therefore be always accepted as a safe guide in this country.\n\nThe analysis of the fixed oil of mustard, and the various other oils with which it is generally sophisticated, also presents considerable difficulties. Not much work has been done in this field. The history of the substances which have been subjected to analysis is seldom given, and the experimental methods are not generally described in sufficient detail to enable the results to be compared. While the information available is meagre, on the one hand, the results published from time to time are in themselves, in some cases, contradictory. It was thus found to be necessary to work out, in the first instance, a series of constants, for\nsuch Indian Foodstuffs as mustard oil, butter, ghee, &c., which might be of some help in deciding cases of falsification.\n\nParticular care was taken in procuring genuine samples of substances. The oils were in many cases expressed under direct supervision from seeds carefully selected, so that the purity of the products was unquestionable. A sample of pure mustard oil was also obtained through the courtesy of the Superintendent, Alipur Jail, and another of coconut oil from the officer in charge of the Kopra works, Viper Island, Port Blair, with a certificate from him guaranteeing its purity and stating it to be a standard sample.\n\nThe preliminary examination of fats and oils is much helped by the application of certain physical tests, e.g., melting point, specific gravity, index of refraction, &c. The work is at present confined solely to the chemical methods. The determination of the physical constants has been reserved for a future occasion.\n\nThe fats and oils are simply combinations of certain acids, the so-called fatty acids, e.g., butyric, stearic, oleic, palmitic, &c., with glycerin; hence they have been named the glycerides. By estimating the amount of either or both of these constituents of fatty substances, valuable information is often obtained as to their nature. Now, if a fat be treated with an alkali, the fatty acids contained in the former, combines with the latter, resulting in the formation of an alkaline salt, commonly called a soap, and the separation of glycerin. It so happens, however, that the molecular weights of some of these fatty acids vary within wide limits. Thus, butyric acid, occurring in butter-fat, has a molecular weight equivalent to 88, while erucic acid, a component of mustard oil, has a molecular weight of 338. A molecule of caustic potash weighing 56, will exactly neutralise 88 parts by weight of butyric acid, or 338 parts by weight of erucic acid. Hence a given weight of butter-fat will require a far larger proportion of caustic potash to convert it into soap, to saponify it, as it is called, than the same weight of mustard oil. Koettstorfer has made use of this principle. It has, in fact been found by actual experiments, that while 100 grammes of butter-fat require very nearly 20 grammes of caustic potash for saponification, the same weight of mustard oil requires only 17 grammes of the alkali. The amount of glycerin also will vary in the same manner. Again, butyric, caproic, and other volatile acids, present in coconut oil, butter-fat, &c., may be easily separated from the non-volatile acids by distillation, and their amount ascertained by their potash neutralising power. Upon this principle is based the well-known Reicherts' test. The amount of iodine absorbed by different fats and oils also lies within wide limits. The iodine absorption has been employed with remarkable success by Baron H\u00fcbl in deciding cases of adulteration.\nThe following processes have been made use of:\n\n1. Direct titration of the fats and oils by alcoholic potash\u2014Koettstorfer's test.\n2. Estimation of the amount of glycerin.\n3. Iodine absorption\u2014Test of H\u00fcbl.\n4. Estimation of the volatile fatty acids\u2014Reichert's test.\n\nFor convenience of reference the results obtained are presented below in a tabulated form:\n\n| Nature of fat or oil | Saponification equivalent | Glycerin, per cent. | Iodine absorption, per cent. |\n|----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Mustard              | 172\u2013176                   | 8\u00b75                | 97\u00b70                        |\n| Niger-Seed           | 190\u00b70                     | 10\u00b78               | 120                         |\n| Cocoanut             | 258\u00b70                     | \u2026\u2026                | 6\u00b79                         |\n| Ghee                 | 218\u2013222                   | \u2026\u2026                | 38\u00b75\u201339\u00b74                   |\n| Mowa-fat             | 199\u00b73                     | \u2026\u2026                | 61\u00b78                        |\n| Mutton-tallow        | 195\u00b76\u2013206                 | 10\u00b75               | \u2026\u2026                         |\n| Sesam\u00e9               | 189\u00b79                     | \u2026\u2026                | 104\u00b75                       |\n| Lard                 | 195\u00b74                     | \u2026\u2026                | 50\u00b70                        |\n| Earthnut             | 195\u00b70                     | \u2026\u2026                | 98\u00b70                        |\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION.\n\nIt would thus appear that as the saponification equivalents of niger-seed oil, mowa-fat, mutton-tallow, sesam\u00e9 oil, lard and earthnut oil are very close to one another, their admixtures in considerable proportions cannot be detected by Koettstorfer's test. Even the saponification equivalent of ghee is not far removed from that of lard or tallow. The saponification equivalents of mustard oil and cocoanut oil are, however, highly characteristic. The iodine numbers on the other hand afford us valuable hints as to the nature of adulteration, the most remarkable features being the exceedingly low numbers for cocoanut oil and for ghees. The results of the application of Reichert's test will be communicated later on.\n\nThe paper will be published in full in the Journal, Part II.\n\n6. Fading Histories.\u2014By S. E.

Most of them have punch-marks\n(perhaps shroff-marks) impressed on their edges, as a rule only from\none to three; but there are four among them, which have their edges\nentirely covered with a series of such punch-marks, about one dozen;\nand it is interesting to notice that some of these punch-marks much\nresemble certain marks on the well-known (so called) Old Hind\u016b\nPunch-mark Coins.\n\nIX.

Notes on Chil\u00e1s traditions.\u2014By Lieutenant J. A. Douglas. Communicated by the Philological Secretary.\n\nThe only connected traditions now current in the Chil\u00e1s neighbourhood, date back no further than the invasion of the country by the Shins. Before this everything is ascribed to \"Devs\" deities, of whom little more than the names survive. Narun was the original founder of Chil\u00e1s, and Taib\u00e1n is said to have founded Gor. The Shins of Chil\u00e1s trace their origin back to R\u00e1n\u00e1 D\u00e1s, a son of the Rajah of Pakli, who invaded Chil\u00e1s some 500 years ago.* At that time the whole of Shink\u00e1ri was governed by a king spoken of as Chachai R\u00e9. After some fighting, Chachai R\u00e9 was defeated; he himself, all his family, and many of his followers were killed, and R\u00e1n\u00e1 D\u00e1s ruled the country\u2014R\u00e1n\u00e1 D\u00e1s was a Hind\u00fa. On his death the people refused to elect a new king, and from that time Chil\u00e1s has been a republic.\n\nR\u00e1n\u00e1 D\u00e1s left two sons, Bhoto and Machuk, and from them sprang two tribes, the Bhote and Machukai.\n\nThe last event of which there is any record is the quarrel between the Bhote and Machukai, which has already been referred to by both Col. Biddulph and Dr. Leitner. The Machukai were expelled from the country and migrated to Hunza, Astor, and other places in the neighbourhood. This is said to have taken place 200 to 250 years ago.\n\nA little later (7 generations, perhaps 200 years ago), the first introduction of Muhammadanism into the country took place. This was effected by Sh\u00e1h Zam\u00e1n, a Saiad from Kag\u00e1n, and an ancestor of the present Kag\u00e1n\u00ed Saiads. He entered Chil\u00e1s with an army, and, presumably by force of arms, converted the inhabitants. They say that after this they gave up burning their dead, though it is probable that the custom lingered for some years later. Sh\u00e1h Zam\u00e1n with his own hand laid the foundation stone of a new fort into which the people moved. And which they continued to inhabit until it was taken and destroyed by the K\u00e1shm\u00edr army in 1851. As an instance of their prosperity at this period, they relate that Chil\u00e1s contained 500 weavers. For many years after this the Chil\u00e1s\u00eds paid tribute to Kag\u00e1n, and the people of Bunar do so still.\n\nThe next invasion of the country was by Shaikh Am\u00e1n\u00ed'd-d\u00edn H\u00e1kim of K\u00e1shm\u00edr, under Ranjit Singh. He was driven out after 18 days fighting. Shortly afterwards, in 1851, the army sent from K\u00e1sh-\n\n* My informant, an old man of about 70, gave me his pedigree back to R\u00e1n\u00e1 D\u00e1s. This included 17 names, but he himself said it was 20 generations ago, which, at 25 years to a generation, would be 500 years.\nmir by Maharajah Gul\u00e1b Singh entered Chil\u00e1s by the Kamukdori Pass, at the head of the Niat Valley, while a small force, probably auxiliaries, crossed over from Astor by the Mazeno and Tosho Passes. Chil\u00e1s was taken after a siege of some months, and many of the people were killed.\n\nThe Chil\u00e1sis say that, at the time of the K\u00e1shmir invasion, they could muster 1,200 fighting men from the fort of Chil\u00e1s alone; now it is doubtful whether they could raise 120 among the remains of the Bhote, or people of Chil\u00e1s proper. They can give no satisfactory explanation of what has caused this rapid diminution of their numbers, attributing it entirely to sickness. There are said to have been two bad epidemics of cholera, within the last 30 years, besides periodical outbreaks of small-pox. A good many families have also emigrated of late years to more fertile districts. Numerous ruins of forts; land, which must have cost years of labour to terrace, now deserted and uncultivated; broken watercourses; their own traditions, and the reputation of daring raiders,\u2014which they have obtained among their neighbours,\u2014all testify to the fact that the country must formerly have been much more thickly populated than at present. It is only of recent years, too, that the neighbouring valleys of Thak, Bunar, &c., have ceased to pay annual tribute to Chil\u00e1s.\n\nThe people of the Thak Valley call themselves Khanai. They trace their descent to Khanu, who is said to have come from Chil\u00e1s. Khanu had a son called Timru, who migrated to the adjacent valley of Niat, where the ruins of his fort, called Timrukot, may be seen close to the village of Theh. In the same way, the people of Bunar are called Bagote. They say that their ancestor Bagotu came from Khanb\u00e1ri 24 generations ago. The people of Hodar are Hodure, and of Thar, Hannke. In the Khinarg\u00e1h Valley, which belongs to Chil\u00e1s, are two ruins of forts, called Khinukot and Shering\u00e1h. These are said to have been strongholds of two kings, called Khinu Sh\u00e1h and Sheo Sh\u00e1h, of whom nothing else appears to be known. (In the Shina language, Khina means black, and Sheo white).\n\nThe so-called \"Horse of Taib\u00e1n\" in Gor, situated on the steep, scarped, rocky side of Chahm\u00fari Peak, which overlooks the Gor Valley. Though the people say it is cut in the rock, as seen from below it appeared only to be a rough outline, the dark lines being formed by water which had found its way through crevices in the rock, and it is only by the exercise of strong imagination that any resemblance to a horse and man can be made out. Its position is almost, if not quite, inaccessible, but the story is that Taib\u00e1n rode up there, and that he and his horse were turned into stone. Lower down in the Gor Valley\nis a spot known as Taib\u00e1n's Garden. It consists only of some trees (ilex) and rocks. A small uncultivated patch in the midst of cultivation. Formerly the people believed that anyone cutting these trees would die at once, but the spirit of scepticism has spread even to Gor, and they believe it no longer. The Gor people say that they became Muhammadans only three generations ago.\n\n2.

F. R. Hoernle, Vice-President, in the chair.\n\nThe following Members were present:\u2014\n\nDr. A. W. Alcock, Babu Gyanendra Kumar Rai Chowdhuri, G. A. Grierson, Esq., T. H. Holland, Esq., Babu Sarat Chunder Lahary, W.A. Lee, Esq., Kumar Rameshwar Maliah, C. R. Marriott, Esq., C. R. Wilson, Esq.,\n\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nThirty-eight presentations were announced, details of which are given in the Library List appended.\n\nThe following gentleman is a candidate for election at the next Meeting:\u2014\n\nShams-ul-alam Maulavi Muhammad Shibli Nomani, Professor of Arabic in the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, Aligarh, proposed by Sir Syed Ahmed, seconded by T. W. Arnold, Esq.\n\nThe Secretary reported the death of the following Member:\u2014\n\nBabu Yadulal Mullick.\n\nThe Chairman announced that the Council had elected Mr. A. Pedler, to officiate as Treasurer in the place of Mr. C. Little.\n\nDr. Alcock shewed a number of relics (small metal images, &c.) obtained by Babu P. C. Mukherji, in the Bhagalpur District, and\nstated to have been exhumed from a kunker quarry at Chandipur, near Patharghatta.\n\nPatharghatta (vide Cunningham, Archaeol. Survey Reports, Vol. XV, 1882, p. 36) is situated near Kolgong, on the Ganges, and is remarkable for some sculptured caves. Near Kolgong also are rock temples and ruins.\n\nThe most perfect of the relics was an eight-petal lotus, each petal sculptured in high relief on the inside and opening and folding on a hinge, the whole enclosing a central many-armed female figure.\n\nThis was considered by experts to be late, and corrupt, Buddhistic.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. Note on an Inscription from Shamsabad, Farrukhabad District, N.W.P.\u2014By William Irvine, Esq., B.C.S., (retired.)\n\nThe accompanying copy of an inscription has been lying by me for a good many years. It was prepared by my order and sent to me on the 11th February 1878, by Munshi Ibrar Hasan Khan, then Tahsil-dar of Qasimganj. It is taken from a stone on a mosque upon the kot (site of the old fort) at Shamsabad Khur, a town near the Ganges, in pargannah Shamsabad West, Farrukhabad District. From the copy the stone appears to be 51 inches x 22 inches, the letters seem to be raised, and the verses are arranged in two rows of three misr'd each, having a row of scroll ornaments between them. If the words Khana-i-Iahi (702 H., August 1302 to August 1303 A.D.), are taken as yielding the date, the mosque is a comparatively ancient building. In any case, the Mohammad Khan named in the first line can have nothing to do with Mohammad Khan, Bangash, the founder of Farrukhabad (Born c. 1660, died 1743 A.D.).\n\nI have referred to Dr. Fuhrer's volume containing lists of inscriptions in the N.-W. Provinces, and I find no mention of the one of which I now send you a copy, for publication, if thought of any value.\n\n[The following transcription and translation has been furnished by Maulawi 'Abdu-l-haqq 'Abid:\u2014\n\n1. \u062f\u064a\u0646 \u067e\u0631\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0644\u0646\u062f \u0631\u062a\u0628\u0647 -\n2. \u0628\u0631\u062f\u0647\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0648\u06cc \u062f\u0631\u0644\u06cc\u062a \u0628\u0627 \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0686\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0646 -\n3. \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0686\u0648 \u0630\u0631\u0642 \u0637\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0622\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0647 -\n4. \u062a\u0631\u0628\u06cc\u062a \u062f\u0627\u062f \u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u0631\u0646 \u0644\u0637\u0641 \u0628\u0632\u062f\u0646\u0627\u0646 -\n5. \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0622\u0646 \u0631\u0641\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u062c\u0633\u062a \u0627\u0632 \u062e\u0631 (\u062f) \u0628\u06af\u0641\u062a\u0627 -\n6. \u0634\u062f \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u06cc \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f \u062e\u0627\u0646 -]\n1894.] U.

On a New Copper-plate Grant of Dharmapala.\u2014By Umesh Chandra Batabyal, Esq., C.S.\n\nAbstract.\n\nThe Honorary Philological Secretary, in drawing attention to the interest which attached to this discovery, said that the members present would remember that our knowledge of the history of Bengal during the 9th and 10th centuries depended almost entirely on a few inscriptions. The first king of the P\u00e2la dynasty, Gop\u00e2la I, was represented by one\nshort inscription dated in the seventh of his reign. His successor Dharmap\u0101la, who came to the throne about 830 A.D., has hitherto also been represented by a single Epigraph at Bodh Gay\u0101, the contents of which give us little information. The present copper-plate grant which has been found by Mr. Umes Chandra Bataby\u0101l close to the ancient city of Gaur, and in which Dharmap\u0101la makes a grant of certain land, was therefore of more than usual importance. The plate carries our knowledge of the P\u0101la family two degrees above that of Gop\u0101la. Mr. Bataby\u0101l reads the name of the grantee as Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dan\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, which is the same as that of one of the five Br\u0101hma\u1e47as brought into Bengal by \u0100di C\u016bra. If it is the same Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dan\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, then the question of the date of \u0100di C\u016bra may be taken as approximately fixed, and we may be certain that \u0100di C\u016bra preceded, instead of following, the P\u0101la dynasty.\n\nThere has not been sufficient time yet to have the plate examined by experts, but a full account of it will be published in the Journal in due course.\n\n3.

Hoey, I.C.S., and read the following notes on the same by Dr. Hoey and Mr. V. A. Smith, I.C.S.\n\nNote on the Sohgaur\u0101 Copper-Plate\u2014By Dr. W. Hoey, I.C.S.\n\nShortly after the Rapti river passes Gorakhpur city it makes a series of rapid bends, and one of these occurs just after it has been joined by the Ami river. It is about a mile-and-a-half across the neck of this bend, and the whole length is a series of mounds, more or less continuous, and these give their names to the homesteads or villages, beginning with Tikar on the North, then Kaithauli, Sohgaur\u0101;\nGurmhi, Malauli, and finally Sahri\u0101, or Sah\u0113riy\u0101, on the South. I have visited all these places, and I believe there was at one time a very large town or city here. The mound, viewing it as a continuous remain rather than a series, is highest at Tikar and S\u014dhgaur\u0101. Buddhist coins are picked up in great numbers at these places, and some old terra-cotta heads are occasionally found. Tikar obviously means only what the place reveals, a mound of 'potsherds;' but down several feet inside I have found large bricks of the Buddhist age.\n\nI have seen the spot where this copper-plate was found, and it is in S\u014dhgaur\u0101, the middle of the long mound of remains. The man who found it is old now. He was digging for a foundation for his house, and he unearthed this plate, thirty or more years ago. He gave it to the zemindar who laid it up in his house. About fifteen months ago, I visited this ancient spot and heard of this plate. The zemindar had died, but his son promised to hunt for the plate, and after a couple of months he produced it and gave it to me. I have reason to think that another plate may have been found in this locality.\n\nGurmhi is the name of the tapp\u0101 in which these villages lie, but the plate was found at S\u014dhgaur\u0101, and as the first name given to any find must be descriptively accurate, I beg that the plate may be described as 'the S\u014dhgaur\u0101 plate,' and on no account as the Gurmhi plate. We must not mislead. Gurmhi has the remains of a \u010caivic temple, and a lingam stands shewing that that place is not Buddhist. The end of the high ground at Sah\u0113riy\u0101 contained remains a few years ago, but the river has cut away what was most interesting. Gold coins of the later Guptas have been found at Sah\u0113riy\u0101. It was a modern place compared to S\u014dhgaur\u0101.\n\nS\u014dhgaur\u0101 is not without significance; for the first component S\u014dh enters into the names of other very ancient places in this district, such as S\u014dhn\u0101g. We may need to note this, because I have found curious things at S\u014dhn\u0101g which I propose to submit.\n\nI have visited the locality of this find twice, and intend to repeat my visit. Should I discover anything more, I shall communicate it to the Society. This 'S\u014dhgaur\u0101 plate' I present to the Society.\n\nNote on the same\u2014By Vincent A. Smith, I.C.S.\n\nDr. William Hoey, I.C.S., Magistrate and Collector of the Gorakhpur District, has been fortunate enough to procure a small inscribed copper-plate of great interest, which he has kindly placed in my hands with permission to publish a preliminary notice of it.\n\nThe plate is rectangular, $2\\frac{1}{8}$ inches long, and $1\\frac{1}{8}$ inch broad, and about $\\frac{1}{8}$th of an inch thick at the edges. A circular hole has been pierced\nnear each corner, and it is evident that it was intended to attach the plate by rivets to some other object. The upper portion of the plate, to the extent of about one-third of the surface, is occupied by symbols, such as are commonly called Buddhistic, and the remaining two-thirds of the surface are covered by an inscription in four lines. Both symbols and letters are cast in high relief, and are in a state of almost perfect preservation. The back of the plate is rough.\n\nThe symbol to the left is a conventional representation of a tree, consisting of a stem and three leaves with stalks, standing inside a railing. The next object may be described as a pavilion with curved convex roof resting on four pillars, and surmounted by a duplicate similar curved roof, resting on three supports, and topped by three short poles.\n\nNext in order comes an object like a long-handled spoon, with a knob at the end of the handle, standing on the knob. The fourth symbol is the so-called conventional \"Buddhist caitya,\" formed of three curves, surmounted by a crescent, with a ball enclosed. The fifth symbol, placed above the line, consists of a disc or ball (the sun), with a crescent (the moon), placed obliquely above it.\n\nThe sixth symbol is a curved tree-stem, without leaves, standing in a railing. The seventh and last symbol is a repetition of the second, namely, the two-storied pavilion.\n\nThe tree of the first symbol may be intended for a sal (Shorea robusta) tree. The leafless tree cannot be identified, nor can I explain the spoon-like object. The shape of the roofs of the pavilions suggests that the figures are intended to represent buildings constructed of wood and bamboos.\n\nThe number of characters (ak\u1e63ara) in the inscription is as follows:\n\n| Line   | Characters |\n|--------|------------|\n| First  | 19         |\n| Second | 19         |\n| Third  | 17         |\n| Fourth | 17         |\n\nTotal 72\n\nThe characters are ancient N\u0101gar\u012b, of the Maurya period, and appear to me not to differ materially from those used in A\u015boka's Girn\u0101r inscription, as given by Dr. Burgess in Plate V of Vol. IV of the Archaeological Survey Reports of Western India.\n\nAlmost every letter is perfect, and can be read at sight without doubt or hesitation.\n\nThe only exceptions are as follow:\n\nLine 1, character 11. This character is blurred, but seems to be a v\u012bra. The dot on it seems to be anusv\u0101ra.\nTHE S\u00d4HGAUR\u00c2 COPPER-PLATE.\n\nFull-size\nLine 3, character 9. This letter is slightly damaged, and may be either \u0935 c, or \u0930 r.\n\nThe last letter in line 1, is plainly \u0932 k, though of small size, owing, apparently, to want of space. Most of the letters are about $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch in height.\n\nThe language seems to be P\u0101li, but I am unable to translate the document. The initial \u0936 s in line 2, and the initial \u0905 a in line 4, certainly make the beginnings of words.\n\nThe plate was found several years ago during the excavation of the foundations of a house at S\u014dhgaur\u0101 near Gurmhi, the seat of a considerable ancient town in the Gorakhpur district. Gurmhi is about eighteen miles distant from Gorakhpur, a little east of south.\n\nThe genuineness of the plate is beyond question.\n\nNo copper-plate inscription of nearly equal antiquity has ever been found, so far as I am aware, and the discovery now announced is, therefore, of considerable interest and importance.\n\nThe transliteration of the S\u014dhgaur\u0101 copper-plate as read by me is as follows:\n\n\u0936\u0935\u0924\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092e\u0930\u0923\u0947\u0928\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0927\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902\n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0924\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0937\u0915\u092e\u0947\u0935\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0926\u093f\u0935\u0947 \u091c\u094b\u0921\u093c\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\n\u0932\u093f\u0916\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f\u092e\u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091a\u0923\u094d\u0921\u092e\u0947\u0935\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f\u092e\u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091a\u0923\u094d\u0921\u092e\u0947\u0935\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\n\nNote on the same\u2014By Dr. A. F. Rudolf Hoernle.\n\nThere are some more letters in this inscription which appear to me doubtful.\n\nLine 1, letter 7, may be \u0917 gh; and letter 11 appears to me rather to be \u0936 sa. The dot above it is attached to the letter, and may be merely one of the unevennesses of the cast. There are numerous (apparently) meaningless dots on the surfaces of the plate, being the result of the plate having been cast in a sand-mould of imperfect smoothness; such dots, e.g., are seen to the left of letters 3, 4, 5, in line 1. The word here intended may be sasana (Skr. p\u0101sana). The length of vowels does not seem to be always indicated.\n\nLine 2, letters 1 and 2 are not quite clear. Letter 2 may be \u0924 t, though there are traces of a left-hand tail, scarcely visible in the facsimile plate, which suggest the reading \u0924\u094d\u0935 tv. Letter 6 is probably only \u0927 dha. Letter 10 is probably only \u0935 va; the dot is attached to the letter, and is probably not an anusvara; but one of the above-noted imperfections of the cast. Letter 13 is not \u0926\u093f di, but \u0926\u0941 du. The words here are \u090f\u0924\u0947 \u0926\u0941\u0935\u0947 \u0915\u094b\u0925-\u0917\u093e\u0932\u093e\u0928\u093f (Skr. k\u014d\u1e6dh-\u0101rgal\u0101ni or perhaps k\u014d\u1e6dh-\n\u0101g\u0101r\u0101\u1e47i), i.e., 'these two bolts of storehouses' (or 'these two store-houses.') They would seem to refer to the two houses, depicted above the writing.\n\nLine 3, letter 11, may be \u1e0da\u1e41; there is a distinct dot on the right of the top; though this again may be merely one of the imperfections of the cast. Letter 14 is uncertain; it looks like \u1e6d l with its left (smaller) limb crossed by a straight line. It can hardly be \u1e63 l\u0101, as read by Mr. Smith; the stroke for the vowel \u1e63 would be attached to the left side of the right (longer) limb of the consonant l. It is just possible, that there are really two letters; viz., \u1e63 n\u0113, made very minutely, and \u1e63 ra. There are several letters, in this inscriptions, made smaller than the rest. The last letter \u1e6d k in the first line, is another instance of such a minute letter. These minute letters may have been originally omitted, and were afterwards inserted in the available space. Other rather smaller letters are No. 2, \u1e6d gh, in line 3, and below it No. 2, \u1e6d k, in line 4. The smallness of these appears to be due to the hole between them.\n\nLine 4, letter 1, is in all probability \u1e6d s (not \u1e6d p). The left (longer) limb and its tail are clearly traceable in the original, and can be just distinguished in the facsimile plate. Letter 6 may be \u1e6d am. In the original there is a distinct dot to the right of \u1e6d a, just discernible in the facsimile. This would give the word am\u1e6diy\u0101 (antiya). Letter 14 has a curious form; the body of it is clearly \u1e6d h, and the mark attached to the top of it, is the usual mark of the vowel \u1e63, but in a reversed position; moreover, there is a dot within the angle of this mark.\n\nThe meeting resolved that a vote of thanks be given to Dr. Hoey for the copper-plate.\n\nThe Natural History Secretary exhibited a Diorite plug, forwarded by Mr. J. Cockburn, Opium Department, and read the following note that accompanied the specimen:\n\n\"Some years ago, probably in 1880, I presented a specimen of a polished celt of Deorite to the Indian Museum. The specimen was from the Banda District, and is remarkable for having a perforation through it which would at first sight lead to the inference that it had been hefted in the modern way, that is, with the handle through an eye in the head of the hatchet, instead of the head being put through an eye in the handle, which was the usual pre-historic method.\n\nAs there has been no known instance of a perforated celt having been found in India, the specimen in question ought to be extremely valuable, were it genuine. This unfortunately it is not, and the\nenclosed core has been drilled out of it and ought to fit the perforation.\n\nTo begin with, the celt itself is a genuine antique\u2014but the perforation is a forgery. This specimen was brought for sale to a gentleman in the Archaeological Survey at Banda by an agate lapidary named, Kiratally, who died lately, so there is no harm in mentioning his name.\n\nThe perforation in the celt was smeared with red-lead, and on examining the specimen carefully, I at once pronounced it a forgery. To begin with, the perforation was at right-angles to the edge, and the implement did not look like an adze.\n\n2ndly. I considered the perforation too small to admit a moderately strong and practicable handle\u2014though there are specimens of European perforated axes in which it is not much larger.\n\n3rdly. On removing a portion of the pigment which had been freshly applied, I at once said that the boring had been recently done. However I purchased the specimen as a forgery, for 8 or 10 rupees, and presented it to the Museum\u2014as such.\n\nOn my return to Banda, in 1883 or 1884, Kiratally presented me with the accompanying core, which he said he had himself bored out of the celt he sold me. The semi-polished facet at one corner of the angular end shows the original weathered surface of the celt.\n\nThe flat end shows where it was broken off, when it stood up as a pillar after the boring had been nearly completed.\n\nThe fragments were probably knocked out from the opposite end with a chisel, hence the pillar in its length will not correspond with the celt in thickness, though it ought to nearly do so in diameter, the difference being due to the loss of material which has been bored away.\n\nI have not been able to fit the plug to the specimen in the Museum, but there can be no doubt as to the authenticity of the fragment. Application might be made to the authorities of the Indian Museum to exhibit the celt at the meeting of the Society at which the paper is read. I propose to present the plug to the Indian Museum after the Society has done with it.\n\nThe method of boring adopted is very ancient and very effective. A tube of copper, brass, or tinned sheet-iron is used as a drill, the cutting edge being charged with finely powdered emery powder. The emery is from the mines of Pipra, in Rewah, which would appear to have been worked for the past 2,000 years.\n\nMr. Flinders Petrie, in his paper on \"The Mechanical Methods of the Ancient Egyptians,\" has proved by partially bored specimens, that the Egyptians perforated hard rocks in this way.\nI may mention that I met at the shop of Kiratally, one of the most enterprising native Coin Collectors in India, a man from Kanouj, who, when he obtained a rare coin, always carefully copied it, and sold his copies to the public. I have seen numbers of his forgeries. Kiratally was a perfect Flint Jack, and could turn out flint flakes, cores, and arrowheads which could hardly be distinguished from genuine. He was a first-rate workman, and had there been a larger field in India for the sale of stone implements might have emulated that misguided individual.\"\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1.

I have just come across a passage in the \"Tozuk-i-Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b\" which I marked years ago, but which had quite escaped my memory when I wrote my \"Catalogue of the Coins of the Mogul and S\u016br\u012b Emperors of India,\" for the Panjab Government. It is in the chapter headed \u062c\u0634\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0632 \u0634\u0634\u0645 \u0627\u0632 \u062c\u0644\u0648\u0633 \u0647\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0648\u0646 and runs thus, at page 96 of the 'Aligarh Edition of 1864, edited by the Hon'ble Sir Sayid Ahmad, K.C.I.E.\n\nThis passage is exceedingly valuable. At page 5 he gives an account of the coins he ordered to be struck. The silver coins he mentions are of 100 tolas, 50 tolas, 20 tolas, 10 tolas, 5 tolas, 1 tola, \u00bc tola, (nig\u0101r) \u00bcth of a tola. He does not mention any coin of more than a tola, except multiples. Now, in all Coin Catalogues there are rupees of Jah\u0101ng\u012br weighing from 210 to 221 grains; whereas his usual rupees weigh only about 176 grains. The Mohurs of his early years, too, run up to 210 grains, as against the usual weight of 168 grains. The change made by the Emperor dates from the 11th of Ardibhi\u0101ht,\nof the 6th year of his reign. In my catalogue, a mohur of Farwardin of year 6, weighs 218 grains, but it has a loop attached and would probably weigh but 210 grains without it. Another mohur of Di, the same year, weighs 168 grains, Di being the tenth month and Farwardin the first; while Ardibihisht is the second month of the year. Of rupees of the 6th year in my list is one struck in Ardibihisht weighing 217 grains; one of L\u0101hor, of Tir 217, and one of L\u0101hor, of Amard\u0101d, of 175 grains. Tir is the fourth month, and Amard\u0101d is the fifth, so that we see that the orders of the Emperor reached L\u0101hor after the striking of these two rupees. They did not reach Kashmir and Qandah\u0101r, however, so easily, for in my catalogue are 3 rupees of Kashmir of the 7th year, weighing 209\u00b75, 210 and 211 grains, and one of Qandah\u0101r weighing 209\u00b75.\n\nThere is a difficulty, however, in the passage. It says that the increase in the mohur and rupee was only three ratis. Now, three ratis is an ordinary variation in rupees from wear and tear, as can be seen by a casual glance at any Coin Catalogue, and such a small increment would not inconvenience anybody. The word for 3 in Persian is \u06f3. I propose to change it to \u06f3\u06f0 or 30. I find that 30 rati seeds gathered by me on the field of Karukhshestra weigh 44 grains, and 44 is the difference between 176 and 220. I find, however, that 30 rati seeds gathered by me at N\u016brp\u016br in the Kangra District weigh 54 grains, so that we must know what kind of ratis were in use in Agra, where probably Jah\u0101ng\u012br held his Court.\n\nSuppose we alter the word rati to m\u0101sha, then three m\u0101shas are equal to 24 ratis. Now, 24 of the N\u016brp\u016br ratis draw exactly 44 grains. Some time ago I obtained from the b\u0101z\u0101r a stone weight, a m\u0101sha, it weighed 9\u00bd ratis. This is the m\u0101sha in use amongst jewellers and sellers of precious stones.\n\nI think the word should be m\u0101sha, and not rati. Ratis are never used for weighing things that are a m\u0101sha in weight, only for weighing fractional parts of the m\u0101sha. Both methods of correcting the text agree with the weights of rupees in our collections. I have not any other edition of the Toznk. The Urdu translation gives 3 ratis, so I presume it was made from the \u0100l\u012bg\u0101r\u1e25 Edition.\n\nThe difference in the weights of the mohurs is not the same as the difference in the rupees 210\u2014168=42 grains. It is, however, near enough. Some of the early mohurs were only 202 grains. As those in the Lahore Museum are as fresh as if they had come from the mint yesterday, we may say that that was their original weight. Afterwards they rose to 210 grains.\n\nI believe this is the only passage in which Jah\u0101ng\u012br notices his\nheavy mohurs and rupees. It gives us the key, however, to his early coinage. Perhaps in the Library of the Asiatic Society there is a good manuscript of the Tozuk-i-Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b. The passage certainly needs correction.\n\nII. In the Tozuk-i-Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b, \u0100l\u012bg\u0101r\u012b Edition of 1864, by \u201cSyud Ahmad,\u201d at p. 207, we have the following:\n\nIn the Urd\u016b translation of the Tozuk, printed at the Niz\u0101mi Press, Cawnpore, in 1291 H. (1874 A.D.), the first part of this extract is thus translated.\u2014p. 154, &c.,\n\nIn the Persian we read that the weights of the tankas were to be ten, twenty times the weights of the mohurs or rupees. In the Urd\u016b we read they were to be halves of the same, and the new coins are termed tangas not tankas.\n\nAgain in the latter part of the Persian we read \u201c\u0641\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0632 \u0645\u0633\u201d this has no meaning. It ought to be \u201c\u0641\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0632 \u0645\u0633\u201d \u201cbesides copper.\u201d\n\nI would remark that the tangas were siyah and sufed, the siyah were of billon, and the coins of the Lodis, and of Firoz Sh\u0101h Tughlaq were nearly all of this kind. The sufed tankas were silver, and this name was given to the coins which were struck by B\u0101bar and Hum\u0101-y\u016bn, and their forefathers. The tangas were always fractional parts of a rupee: they were never heavy coins, or valuable coins.\n\nMy object in drawing the attention of the members of the Society to this passage, is to obtain various readings of the parts overlined. There must be manuscripts of the Tozuk-i-Jah\u0101ng\u012br\u012b, by the dozen, in different libraries in India. Will members kindly assist in ascertaining the true readings.\nNo coin with these legends have yet been found. They may be in existence in either Ahmadabad, Cambay, Surat, Ahmadnagar, or Bombay.\n\n3.

Holland, Esq., Kumar Rameshwar Maliah, J. Mann, Esq., Pandit Haraprasad Sastri, The Rev. H. Whitehead, C. R. Wilson, Esq.\n\nVisitors:\u2014H. V. Elliott, Esq., The Rev. W. Field.\n\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nTwenty-six presentations were announced, details of which are given in the Library List appended.\n\nThe following gentlemen duly proposed and seconded at the last meeting of the Society were ballotted for and elected Ordinary Members:\u2014\n\nSurgeon-Captain D. M. Moir, I.M.S.\nKunwar Kushal Pal Sinha, M.A.\n\nThe following gentleman is a candidate for election at the next meeting:\u2014\n\nM. N. Chatterjee, Esq., Professor of Philosophy, Maharaja's College, Patiala, proposed by Pandit Haraprasad Sastri, seconded by Babu Panchanan Mukhopadhyaya.\n\nThe following gentlemen have expressed a wish to withdraw from the Society:\u2014\n\nColonel H. S. Jarrett.\nDr. William King.\nThe Secretary reported the death of the following members:\u2014\nMahamahapadhyaya Kaviraja Shyamaladas (Ordinary Member).\nB. H. Hodgson, Esq., (Honorary Member).\n\nThe Secretary reported that Mr. E. D. Maclagan had compounded his subscription as a non-resident member by the payment in a single sum of Rs. 300.\n\nDr. Alcock exhibited and remarked upon some marine Invertebrates lately dredged at a considerable depth by the survey ship 'Investigator.'\n\nThe first specimen exhibited was a new species of Brachiopod, of the genus *Terebratula*, remarkable for its huge size, and in being slightly inequilateral; as well as from the depth of its habitat (719 fathoms), and from the fact that it was one of the first species of the genus recorded from Indian waters.\n\nThe species will be described and figured in Pt. II. of the Journal.\n\nThe second specimen exhibited was the curious Thalassinid Crustacean, *Calocaris macandreae*, Bell, lately dredged in the Laccadive Sea at a depth of 636 fms., the bottom temperature being about 44\u00b0 Fahr. This species was interesting on account of the wide extent of its range. First dredged in Loch Fyne, off the south-west coast of Scotland, at a considerable depth, and subsequently in Scandinavian waters, it was next reported from the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and then from the antipodes of New Zealand. It is now recorded as an addition to the Indian fauna.\n\nThe third specimen exhibited was a new species of Crab of the genus *Calappa*, specially noticeable, first for its large size, and secondly for the depth (112 fms.) at which it occurred.\n\nThe species of the numerically small genus *Calappa* were as a rule littoral in habit, but this species belonged to the fauna of the deep sea, although it exhibited no conspicuous structural modifications for life at a depth. The specimen will be described in *Journal* Part II, and will be figured in an early issue of \"Illustrations of the Zoology of the R. I. M. S. Investigator.\"\n\nThe following papers were read:\u2014\n\n1. *On some Behari Customs and Practices.*\u2014By Babu Sarat Chandra Mitra, M.A., B.L. Communicated by Pandit Haraprasad Sastri, M. A.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIn Behar a wife's elder sister is regarded as a superior member of the family who is to be approached in a respectful attitude; while in Bengal, she is regarded, as a boon companion, with whom one is at liberty to crack\njokes. Mother's brothers wife is regarded as a superior in Bengal, but she is not so regarded in Behar.\n\nTo beat with a broken cooking-vessel is regarded as a great insult in Behar and if the vessel be covered with soot it is doubly insulting.\n\nThe Behari women, when they meet after a long time, give vent to their feelings in loud lamentation and take each other in their arms.\n\nThe Beharis greet their friends by saying \"R\u0101m R\u0101m.\" The Hanuman, is regarded in Behar as a sacred animal, and is never molested though it often commits mischief.\n\nThey think that they get looseness of the bowels when these are displaced, and the best remedy for looseness among them is rubbing the abdominal parts.\n\nBehari women are fond of wearing brass ornaments. They often have to invoke the assistance of ironsmiths to fit these on their person. People suffering from severe illness often take a vow of measuring the whole distance from their home to a sacred place with their person and often raise a standard in honor of the Monkey-god.\n\n2. North Indian Folk-lore about Thieves and Robbers.\u2014By Babu Sahat Chandra Mitra, M.A., B.L. Communicated by Pandit Haraprasad Sastri, M.A.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe Thieves and Robbers in India are said to be under the special protection of a female deity, who is known under various designations: as K\u0101l\u012b, in Bengal; Dev\u012b or M\u0101t\u0101 in Hindustan; and Bhar\u0101n\u012b among the Thugs. The images of this goddess in the immediate neighbourhood of Calcutta, namely, that at K\u0101ligh\u0101t and that at Chitpore, used to be greatly honored by Dacoits before the English became the rulers of Bengal. There are many protectresses of robbers known all over Bengal as D\u0101k\u0101te K\u0101l\u012b; at Manas\u0101 Devi, near Kalka, a fair is still held in honor of a robbers' deity though the fair has at present changed its character very materially. The Bengal collection of proverbs are full of allusions to thieves, dacoits. No fewer than fifteen have been given in the paper. There was a curious way in which the thieves used to get the instruments of house-breaking made by the blacksmiths. They used to go, secretly, at dead of night, to the blacksmith's shop and deposit a piece of iron and a few pice by way of wages, and, the next night at that very hour they used to get the instrument deposited there. There is a proverb in Bengal that the thief and the blacksmith never meet and yet the instrument for housebreaking is at work.\n\nRemarks:\u2014In the Mriceha katika, the god K\u0101rtika, the General of the Gods, is regarded as the patron of thieves and the originator of the\nart of stealing, an art which used to be taught carefully to the upper classes of the Indian Society, as a part of liberal education. See Da\u00e7a-kum\u0101racharita.\n\nThe papers will be published in full, in the Journal, Part III.\n\n3. Note on the stridulating powers of the Ocypode Crab (Ocypoda cera tophthalma, Pall).\u2014By Surgeon-Captain A. R. Anderson, B.A., M.B., Surgeon-Naturalist to the Marine Survey.\n\nThe papers will be published in the Journal, Part II.\n\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in June last:\u2014\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS, AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nAngers.

F. Peppe, Esq.\nThe following obituary notice was read by Dr. A. F. Rudolf Hoernle*:\n\nIn Brian Houghton Hodgson the Society has to deplore the loss of one of its oldest and most distinguished members. He joined the Society on the 24th April, 1833, as an Ordinary Member, and on the 6th July, 1858, he was elected an Honorary Member. He was, probably, the largest contributor that the Society ever possessed. The papers published by him in the \"Society's Asiatic Researches\" and \"Journal\" amount to a total of 112; besides, he made large donations of exceedingly valuable manuscripts and specimens of Natural History. In fact, the progress of the Society during the whole period of his residence in India, was intimately connected with him, and the Society showed its appreciation of his services by voting him a bust on the eve of his departure from India, on the 6th February, 1844. He first came out to India in 1818, \"the year of Warren Hastings' death; his term of service was finished before Lord Hardinge became Governor-General, and he survived into Viceroyalty of the second Earl of Elgin, dying on the 23rd May of this year, in the ninety-fifth year of his age. Almost all his period of public work was spent in Nepal, where he was appointed Secretary in 1820, and Resident in 1831.\" There, \"by his profound knowledge of the people, their country, language, and religion he succeeded in making the British name not only feared but respected.\" In 1843 he resigned the service, and returned home. Two years afterwards, however, he came back to India, where he settled at Darjeeling to continue his researches, till 1858, when he finally retired to England.\n\nBrian Hodgson's chief merit lies in having utilised, with extraordinary zeal and industry, the unique opportunities which he enjoyed for the collecting of materials that helped to advance our knowledge of India in the widest sense. Nor was his interest in things Indian limited to any one department of science. Most of our knowledge of Nepal we still owe to him. Though he was not allowed to explore that country himself,\u2014any more than Europeans are to this day,\u2014yet \"by his personal influence with the governing class, by interviewing all strangers who visited the Court and sacred places of Nepal, and by sending out native collectors in every direction, he was able to accumulate an immense store of trustworthy information about the people and the country. The results are to be found partly in the numerous papers which he contributed to this Society; but still more in the invaluable collections of manuscripts, and specimens of Natural History with which\n\n* See also an obituary notice by J. S. C. in The Academy, June 2, 1894.\nhe enriched the museums of Europe as well as of India.\" \"It was from the MSS. he then sent to Paris that Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf was enabled to undertake the first accurate examination of the origin of Buddhism;\" and equally important was his acquisition of the great Tibetan Encyclopaedia, in 334 volumes, which now repose in the library of the India Office. He was also the first to collect vocabularies of the unwritten dialects of the hill tribes throughout India, from the Himalayas to Ceylon. But he was no less devoted to Natural History. The pages of the Journal of this Society bear full witness to his researches. No less than eleven species of the Mammalia and one genus of the Aves of India are named after him; and both the Indian Museum and the British Museum owe many of their specimens to his generosity. To the solution of practical questions, too, he contributed his share of pioneer-work: such as the possibilities of commerce between Nepal and British India, the policy of enrolling Gurkha battalions in the native army, the suitability of the Sub-Himalayas for sanitariums, and others.\n\nThough Brian Hodgson received no mark of distinction from his own Government, our Society\u2014his own Society\u2014gave him (as already stated) a bust, placed in the room in which we meet to-day, the Royal Society made him a Fellow, and the Oxford University gave him the D. C. L. degree. France also gave him the Legion of Honour, a medal specially struck by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique, and the Corresponding Membership of the Institute. But his real distinction is his works, of which three collected volumes were published in 1874 and 1880.\n\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited an old Assamese Gold Coin, and read a note on the same, by E. A. Gait, Esq., C. S.\n\nThe note will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\nThe following papers were read:\u2014\n\n1. Abstract Contents of one of the Ahom Pathis of Asam.\u2014By E. A.

Ancient Bengali Literature under Muhammadan Patronage.\u2014By Pandit Hara Prasad Shastri, M.A.\n\nAla-Uddin Husain Shah was one of the greatest Sovereigns of Bengal. He rose from the humble position of a menial servant to a Kayastha officer, of the later Illias Shahi Dynasty of Bengal. It is said that his Master, Subuddhi Khan, did not scruple even to beat his humble Muhammadan Servant. The secret of Hussain's success appears to have been his conciliatory policy towards the Hindus. He gave high offices under the State to learned Brahmins and shrewd Kayasthas. R\u00fcp and San\u00e4ton were his ministers. Hiranya and Gobardhan held under him the Viceroyalty of the whole of Satgaon. The family\nof Narottom D\u0101s rose to eminence during his reign. He tolerated the Hindu religion. Chaitanyaism flourished and spread during his time. Sanskrit learning revived during the prosperous period of the rule of his dynasty.\n\nFollowing the example of their Noble Master, the Provincial Governors and Generals also assumed a conciliatory policy towards their Hindu subjects. This enabled Husain to make extensive conquests in every direction. He conquered a portion of Tripura, and the greater part of Chattag\u0101ram. He destroyed the powerful dynasty of Kamtapur, in the north, and led several expeditions against the King of Orissa. He afforded an asylum to the last fugitive King of Jaunpur, and thereby risked the displeasure of the powerful Lodi King of Delhi. All this he was enabled to do because the Hindus were friendly towards him, and he had nothing to fear at home.\n\nOne of the means by which he and his Generals conciliated the Hindus, was the encouragement of their Vernacular literature. Before Husain's time the Bengalis possessed a Vernacular literature. The R\u0101may\u0101na had been translated by Kirttiv\u0101sa and the Bh\u0101gavat by Gu\u1e47ar\u0101j Khan. There were innumerable popular versions of the stories of Manas\u0101, Mangalac\u0101ndi, and Dharmar\u0101j. The Manas\u0101 Mangal, by Bipra D\u0101s, was composed in 1495. But it appears that as yet the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rat had not been translated. It was a great desideratum. Popular Hinduism can scarcely do without a Bengali version of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rat, and a Muhammedan General of Husain Shah undertook to have it translated under his own patronage. His name was Par\u0101gol Khan. I do not know how the name will spell in Persian. Par\u0101gol was the Laskar or General of Husain Shah, and held his Court at Chittagong. (1) He employed a native bard Param\u0113\u00e7var, who was dignified with the title of Kavindra. (2) The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rat that was translated was\n\n(1) \u092c\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0928 \u091c\u0935\u0947\u0928 \u0938\u093e\u0927 \u0930\u0925 \u092e\u0927\u093e\u0932\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0925\u092e \u092e\u094b\u0921\u093c\u0947 \u092c\u0930\u094d\u0924 \u092a\u0930\u092e \u0935\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0924\u093f\u0965\n* * * \u092a\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0915\u093e\u0932 \u092e\u0927\u093e\u0932\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0902 \u0935\u0938\u0928 \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925 \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924 \u092e\u0924\u093f\u0965\n\u092c\u093e\u0939\u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924 \u0928\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092a \u092f\u093e\u0926\u0935\u093e * * * \u091a\u093f\u0915\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0938\u093e\u0964 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u093f\u092a\u093e\u0932 \u091a\u093f\u0915\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0938\u093e * * * *\u0965\n* * \u0930\u093e\u0927 \u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0936\u093e\u0928 \u092e\u0927\u093e\u0932\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u0909\u0930\u093e\u0927 \u0927\u0941\u092e\u0928 \u0928\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092a \u092c\u0930\u094d\u0924\u092a\u093f\u0924 \u091a\u0932\u093f\u0965\n\u092c\u093e\u0939\u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924 \u092e\u0927\u093e\u0932\u094b\u0915 \u091a\u0932\u093f \u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0926\u0924\u093f\u0964 * * * * \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924\u0915\u093e\u0932 \u0927\u0941\u092e\u0928\u0965\n\u0915\u094b\u091c\u0932\u0924\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0947 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u093e\u092f \u0930\u093e\u091c\u092d\u093e\u0932\u0940\u0964 leaf 1\n\n(2) \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092f\u0941\u0932 \u092a\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0915\u093e\u0932 \u092a\u0936\u094d\u091a\u093f\u092e\u0940 \u092d\u093e\u0937\u094d\u0915\u0930\u0964 \u0915\u0935\u0940\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0915\u0935\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924 \u0927\u0941\u092e\u0928 \u0915\u0932\u094d\u0915\u0930\u0965 leaf 55\n\u092c\u094b\u0927\u093e\u092f\u0928\u0947 \u092f\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925 \u0927\u0941\u092e\u0928 \u0930\u0938\u0938\u094d\u092f\u0964 \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924 \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u0965 leaf 96\n\u092c\u093e\u0939\u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924 \u092a\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0915 \u0927\u0941\u092e\u0928 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u093e\u092f\u0964 \u0915\u0935\u0940\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u092a\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0915\u0947 \u0930\u091a\u093f\u0924 \u092a\u0925\u093e\u0930\u0965 leaf 291\nJaimini's and not Vaisamp\u0101yana's. Janamajaya seems to have incurred the wrath of a Rishi, who cursed him, and the curse produced leprosy. The king in distress sent for Vy\u0101sa, who ordered the king to hear from his pupil, Jaimini, the story of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. The interlocutors are Janamajaya and Jaimini. It is curious that the Jaimini Bh\u0101rata is not to be found in its entirety in Sanskrit. The only Parva, that is extant, is the \u0100gama\u1e47\u1e0dha Parva. But the Bengali version contains the whole of the Jaimini Bh\u0101rata. From this it appears certain that 400 years ago, in Hussain Shah's time, the Jaimini Bh\u0101rata was procurable in its entirety. I have procured a copy of Par\u0101gol's Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, very nearly complete, at Komilla, from a shopkeeper who came from Chittagong.\n\nAt the end of the \u0100gama\u1e47\u1e0dha Parva of this work which runs through 12 leaves only, there is a curious passage to the effect that Par\u0101gol's son, Chuti Khan, had ordered \u010crikar Nandi, another poet, to give a full account of the wars described in that Parva. This stimulated my travelling Pundit Binod Vih\u0101ri K\u0101vyatirtha to see if Chuti Khan's \u0100gama\u1e47\u1e0dha Parva was procurable. After a diligent search in Tripura during the last rainy season his exertions were rewarded with marked success. He found in the collection of Babu Anukul Chandra Ray, a landholder in the vicinity of Komilla, a copy of Chuti Khan's work, complete in 87 leaves. He has brought a complete notice of the work, from which it appears that Chuti Khan was as great a patron of\n\n(1) See Notices of Sanskrit Mas. by Raj\u0101 Rajendralal Mitra vol vi page 219.\n\n(6)\nBengali literature as his father. After the usual benedictory verses, the work gives some account of Nasrat Shah, the son of Husain Shah, the Sultan of Bengal. Chuti Khan was a general of Nusrat Shah. He invested Tripura and compelled its King to abandon his capital in the plains and to retire to the hills and there found a new city, perhaps, Udayapura.\n\nChuti Khan loved his father tenderly, and received from the Sultan many marks of distinction. His father's Jagir was Charlol a little to the North of Chittagong, in the beautiful Mount Candra \u00c7ekhara. The land was surrounded on all sides by the river Funi. (6)\n\nAs already mentioned, the poet who wrote the A\u00e7vamedha Parva, under the patronage of Chuti Khan, was \u00c7rikar Nandi or \u00c7rikaran Nandi. (?) He treats his work as a supplement to the greater work of Kavindra Paramesvara. The language of the work is very good Bengali. There is no pedantic use of Sanskrit words, and is completely free from Persian influence. There are, indeed, such forms as \u0936\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0928, \u0935\u093f\u0935\u0947\u091a\u0928, \u0926\u0941\u0903\u0916\u0940 \u092c\u093e\u0932\u0915, &c., the old Pali and Prakrit forms which have not yet been eliminated from the language. A study of these works is likely to remove that misapprehension about the poverty of the Bengali language, which has induced some of the Bengali writers to coin new words, and to make the modern Bengali style jar in the ears of the Bengali public.\n\n(6) \u0905\u091a\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0927\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0924\u093e\u0932 \u091a\u0924\u093f \u092e\u0927\u093e\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0964 \u0930\u093e\u092e * * \u092a\u093e\u0915\u0947 \u091a\u0935 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0964\n\n\u091a\u092a\u0924\u093f \u0921\u0942\u092c\u0947\u0928 \u0927\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0925\u0947 * \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u091a\u093e\u092e\u0926\u093e\u0928 \u0926\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u093e\u0916\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u0939\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0940\u0964\n\n\u0924\u093e\u0930 \u090f\u0915 \u092c\u0947\u0928\u093e\u092e\u0924\u093f \u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930 \u091a\u091f\u0940\u091a\u093e\u092e\u0964 \u091a\u093f\u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0930 \u0909\u092a\u0930\u093f \u0915\u0930\u093f\u0915 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0924\u093f\u0964\n\n\u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930 \u092c\u093e\u0930\u0947\u0902 \u0928\u093f\u0915\u0932 \u091a\u0909\u0930\u0947\u0964 \u092a\u093e\u0916\u0947 \u091a\u091f\u0940\u091a\u093e\u092e \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0902 \u091a\u0909\u0930\u0947\u0964\n\n\u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0924\u093f \u091a\u0948\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930 \u091a\u092a\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u093f \u0930 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0924\u093f \u0932\u093e\u0915\u0947 \u091a\u093f \u091a\u092a\u0924\u093f \u091a\u092a\u0924\u093f\u0964\n\n\u092a\u093e\u0916\u0947 \u091a\u093e\u092e \u0917\u0926\u0940 \u092c\u0947 \u091a\u0947\u0924\u093f\u0924 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u093f\u091a\u093e\u092e\u0964 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093f\u0915\u0947 \u092e\u0927\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0915\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0930 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u093f\u091a\u093e\u092e\u0964\n\n\u091a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930 \u092a\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0915 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u093f\u091a\u093e\u092e \u0938\u0924\u092f\u0964 \u091a\u0909\u0930\u0947 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0924\u093f \u091a\u0941\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u091a\u093e\u092e \u092e\u0927\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0915\u0964\n\n\u091a\u093f\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u091a\u092a\u0924\u093f \u092f\u093e\u0930 \u091a\u0930\u0947 \u091a\u0941\u0921\u093c\u0947 \u0926\u0947\u0936\u0964 \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u0902 \u091a\u0909\u0930\u0947 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u093f \u091a\u0930\u093f\u0915 \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u092e\u0964\n\n\u091a\u093e\u092e\u091a\u093e\u092e \u091a\u093e\u0930\u093f\u091a\u093e\u092e \u091a\u0930\u093f\u0915 \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u092e\u0964 \u091a\u093e\u092e \u091a\u093e\u092e\u091a\u093e\u092e \u0938\u0924\u0947 \u091a\u0941\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0924\u093f\u0964\n\n\u0924\u093e\u0930 \u091a\u093e\u092e \u091a\u093e\u092e\u091a\u093e\u092e \u0938\u0924\u0947 \u091a\u0941\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0924\u093f \u091a\u093e\u0930\u093f\u091a\u093e\u092e \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u092e\u0964\n\n(7) The Colophon of Chuti Khan's work has this:\u2014\n\n\u091a\u093e\u092e\u091a\u093e\u092e \u091a\u093e\u092e \u091a\u093e\u092e\u091a\u093e\u092e \u0938\u0924\u0947\u0964 \u091a\u0941\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0924\u093f \u091a\u093e\u092e\u091a\u093e\u092e\u0964\n\n\u091a\u093e\u092e\u091a\u093e\u092e \u091a\u093e\u092e\u091a\u093e\u092e \u0938\u0924\u0947\u0964 \u091a\u0941\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0924\u093f \u091a\u093e\u092e\u091a\u093e\u092e\u0964\n\n\u091a\u093e\u092e\u091a\u093e\u092e \u091a\u093e\u092e\u091a\u093e\u092e \u0938\u0924\u0947\u0964 \u091a\u0941\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0924\u093f \u091a\u093e\u092e\u091a\u093e\u092e\u0964\n\n\u091a\u093e\u092e\u091a\u093e\u092e \u091a\u093e\u092e\u091a\u093e\u092e \u0938\u0924\u0947\u0964 \u091a\u0941\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092a\u0924\u093f \u091a\u093e\u092e\u091a\u093e\u092e\u0964\nThe Codex belonging to Babu Anukul Chandra Ray was copied on the 24th of Crabon, in the 1585th year of the Caka era, that is, 233 years from this date.\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the Meeting held in August last:\n\nTransactions, Proceedings, and Journals,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBaltimore.

Beveridge, Esq., late C. S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nMr. Beveridge's paper consists of an analysis and partial translation of the Bengal chapters of Il\u0101hi Bakhsh of M\u0101dah's M. S. work called the Khurshid Jah\u0101n Num\u0101. Il\u0101hi Bakhsh gives a detailed account of the antiquities of Gauf and Pandu\u0101 and copies of the inscriptions to be found there. He began his book so long ago as 1853, but it has never been published, and so most of his inscriptions have appeared already in the Society's Journal, and in Ravenshaw's Gauf. Five inscriptions however, appear to be new, viz., those of 711, 913, 943, 1000, and 1059 A. H. He has also given chronograms of the deaths, &c., of the Saints of Pandu\u0101 viz., Jal\u0101lu-d-din Tabrizi, \u2018Al\u012bn-l-Haqq, and N\u016br Qutb and much curious and novel information about their shrines, &c. He has also described a coin of Mahm\u016bd Shah of 944 A. H.\n\nMr. Beveridge recommends that the Society should publish Persian extracts from Il\u0101hi Bakhsh's work, viz., pp. 4 and 5, so far as they describe the composition and contents of the Khurshid Jah\u0101n Num\u0101, and pp. 145 (beginning with the account of Pandu\u0101)\u2014224, omitting the plans and certain portions. It does not appear necessary to print the rest of the volume except portions of pp. 246 and 286, and the author's account of himself from p. 497 to the end. Mr. Beveridge has given translations of the important parts of the book. By referring to them the council will be able to judge what portions of the text should be printed.\n\nThe date, 738 A. H. or 1337, given by Il\u0101hi Bakhsh for Jal\u0101lu-d-din's departure from Pandu\u0101 is very interesting as it agrees with Ibn Batut\u0101's account. That traveller saw Jal\u0101lu-d-din in Sylhet or Assam about 740 A.H., and before Jal\u0101lu-d-din had gone to the Maldives. Mr.\nBeveridge has also given an extract from the translations of the Bombay Geographical Society confirmatory of the tradition that Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn is buried in the Maldive islands.\n\nThis paper will be published in full in the Journal, Part I.\n\n4. Discovery of the remnants of Buddhism in Bengal.\u2014By P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dit Harapras\u0101d \u010c\u0101stri, M. A.\n\nDharma-worship prevails in Western and Southern Bengal. It has the following noteworthy features which distinguish it from other forms of Hind\u016b worship.\n\n1. The name of the deity is either Dharm\u0101-r\u0101j or simply Dhamma. His worship is called Dhamma p\u016bj\u0101.\n\n2. His temples face either East or South. But he is often worshiped under a tree and sometimes in the open mayad\u0101n.\n\n3. Where he has a permanent habitation he is represented by a piece of round stone with one or two brass nails, called \"t\u014dp,\" driven through it. In other places he is worshiped in the form of a gh\u0101\u1e6da, or earthen jar, full of water.\n\n4. His priests are D\u014dms, P\u014dds, B\u0101gdis, and men of other low castes. Br\u0101hma\u1e47as rarely worship him as Dharma.\n\n5. Daily worship is not insisted upon. The worship is mostly of a votive character.\n\n6. The annual festival, which is generally held on the full moon in the month of Vai\u015b\u0101kha, is a time of great rejoicing for the lower classes, from which the higher classes generally hold aloof.\n\n7. The principal feature of this annual festival was the athletic feat of swinging on a lofty pole which was put a stop to in 1868 under orders of Government.\n\n8. At this festival a long poem is recited which goes under the name of Dharma m\u0101rgal or Dhamma Th\u0101kur\u0113r G\u0101n.\n\n9. Dhamma is worshiped with mantras which appear to be very curious.\n\nThere are reasons to think that this is a remnant of Buddhism, and all the nine points enumerated above lead to the same conclusion.\n\n1. The name of the deity is Dharm\u0101-r\u0101j. This is another name of Buddha for the Amara K\u014d\u1e63a says:\u2014\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c\u0903 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0923\u094b \u091a\u0942\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c\u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0903 Dharm\u0101 is also the first of the Buddhist Triad. Buddhism was itself known to its followers by the name of Sad-Dharm\u0101 or simply Dharm\u0101. Babu \u010carat Candra D\u0101s quoting from an unpublished work of the Tibetan T\u0101r\u0101n\u0101th, says, that after the destruction of Higher Buddhism by the Mu\u1e25ammadans, the popular and t\u0101ntrik Buddhism remained in Bengal and was known under the name of Dharm\u0101.\n2. Dhamma is popularly said to be a form of \u015aiva. This is disproved by the fact that his temples face the East while \u015aiva temples face the West. The worship under a tree reminds one of the worship of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as of the Buddhists or of the Bodhidrums.\n\n3. The brass nails on the stones representing Dhamma are said to be his eyes. Now, in the Buddhist Triad Dhamma used to be represented by a st\u016bpa with two eyes on the neck, i.e., just where the stone umbrellas begin, and the st\u016bpa was the great object of worship in a Buddhist Vih\u0101ra.\n\n4. Dhamma is perhaps the only deity, who is worshiped by other castes than Br\u0101hma\u1e47as. The \u0100guris, Go\u015b\u0101s, Mayar\u0101s, B\u0101ruis and others may be priests of Dhamma. But Doms are regarded as particularly fit priests for the deity. Now Doms have not as yet admitted br\u0101hma\u1e47as to be their domestic priests. There are Pandits among Doms who perform all their religious ceremonies for them. Dhamma is said to have given the Doms a boon that they should be his constituted priests and that they should be allowed to drink wine and eat hog's flesh.*\n\nBabu \u010carat Candra Das quoting from an unpublished work of T\u0101r\u0101n\u0101th says, that during the reign of Nasiruddin, a Dom Buddhist obtained siddhi or final success and organized t\u0101ntrik Buddhism then still prevailing in Bengal.\n\n5. Wherever a Buddhist ruin has been explored, the explorer has been rewarded with a number of votive st\u016bpas in clay or stone. Wooden st\u016bpas in the form of kau\u1e6dhas or wooden caskets with high steeples are still to be found gracing Dhamma trees. Horses of burnt earth are offered more frequently than kau\u1e6dhas. Some of the Dhamma Th\u0101kurs are said to be Jigrata or wide-awake and that their favour always grants success to the worshiper. Numbers flock to some of Dhamma temples and offer him P\u016bj\u0101 for recovery from diseases, gaining advancement in life and so forth. The offerings are made over to the priest of the temple, a Dom or Mayar\u0101 or Teli, and he presents it to the deity. But proud br\u0101hma\u1e47as when they offer any votive offering disdain to have it presented by a low fellow and so they bring their own priests. In some temples in the vicinity of large br\u0101hma\u1e47a population, there are two priests, one low born, and the other br\u0101hma\u1e47a for presenting votive offerings. In one case the br\u0101hma\u1e47a has completely supplanted his low born rival, and he now worships the deity with \u015aiva mantras and looks upon him as \u015aiva. But in the daily worship he divides the naivedya, or rice offering, placed on a brass plate in the shape of a cone, into two semi-cones making a trench with his finger, and offers the joint naivedya to the joint deity saying \u0928\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e \u092d\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0930\u093e\u092e \u0928\u092e\u0903\u0964\n\n* See page 385a of Dharma M\u0101rgal published at Calcutta in B.S. 1295.\n6. The annual festival in honour of Dhamma takes place on the Vai\u015b\u0101khi P\u016br\u1e47im\u0101, the birth-day of Lord Buddha.\n\n7. Athletic sports were a principal feature in ancient Indian festivals.\n\n8. The long poem that is recited at the annual festival is an attempt to prove the B\u0101rmati of Dhamma. Now the word B\u0101rmati was a great puzzle to me, but looking more carefully into the book I found that it is often replaced by the word Brahmati, i.e., Brahmatva. The poem therefore attempts to prove that Dhamma is Brahma, or the Supreme Being, above Bidhi, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and \u015aiva. The scene of the story, given there, is placed in Western Bengal, in Ga\u1e47\u1e0d and in K\u0101mar\u016bpa, at a time when the son of the great Buddhist king Dharmap\u0101la was reigning in Ga\u1e47\u1e0d. The Doms figure in the work largely, and obtain the boon mentioned above. The recension of the work that has been printed was made in 1710, A.D., and is therefore much mixed up with later ideas. But the book itself speaks of older recensions, which I am searching for, at present, and hope to get at no distant future.\n\nThe mantra with which Dhamma is worshiped is this\u2014\n\nThe Sanskrit is absolutely un-grammatical, but there is no doubt that it refers to Buddha. No Hindu would ever conceive any deity as \u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dha\u1e25: or void, while the Buddhists of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na school were \u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dha\u1e25, that is, they thought that after Nirv\u0101\u1e47a, the Bodhisattva remains in a condition of \u0100rya, that is, an inconceivable condition of which neither existence, nor non-existence, neither a negation of the two nor a combination of the two, can be predicated: \u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dha\u1e25-\u0101rya\u1e25-\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101\u1e25. Then Dhamma is said to be \u0101rya\u1e25 and one of the synonyms of Buddha is Munindra; \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101: \u0101rya\u1e25: \u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dha (\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u091f \u0915\u094b\u0923:) The word \u0928\u093f\u0926\u093e\u0928\u092e\u094d is a Buddhist technical term, and it has been recently so expounded in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nThe translation of the mantra will run thus:\u2014\n\nHe who has no beginning, no middle and no end, he who has neither legs nor hands, he who has no germ of a body, he who has no frame and no form, and no birth, may that Lord of sages approachable only through knowledge, the pervader of all living beings, the Lord of all the worlds, the spotless, the giver of boons to mortals, the void, may he protect you.\nThe name of the deity, his lowly priesthood and the story of the Dharma Mangal raised a strong presumption in my mind in favour of the Buddhist origin of the worship. In reviewing the work \"Dharma Mangal\" published by the Bayavasi Press, I wrote in one of the annual reports of the Bengal Library that the Dharma cult might either be a remnant of decayed Buddhism or that it might be some form of non-Aryan worship. But the discovery of the mantra and the fact that the annual festival is held on the birth-day of Buddha leave little doubt of the Buddhistic origin of this cult.\n\n5.

A short note on the food-insects of the mantis Hierodula bipapilla, Serv.\u2014By Edward Barlow, Entomology Assistant, Indian Museum.\n\nAbout the beginning of the month of November last, I received two living specimens of a Mantis, Hierodula bipapilla, Serv., from an employee of the Museum, Munshee Kassimuddin, who had captured them at night in the vicinity of Harrison's Road where they had been attracted by the glare of the electric light. The morning after their capture they were as lively as ever, evidently not having suffered much from being confined the whole night in a closed paper bag; and so, being curious to witness what I had previously read about the life history and voracity of these insects, I confined them in a large glass rearing-cage, especially selecting this kind of cage as being large and easily seen into without disturbing the insects. The insects on being transferred from the paper bag to the rearing-cage showed signs of great delight, evidently thinking that they had gained their liberty. On the first day of their confinement I placed a dozen living specimens of a fly (Musca sp.) commonly found among kitchen refuse and other rubbish, and patiently waited to watch their manoeuvres. The mantises on perceiving the flies were at once on \"the alert,\" putting themselves into their characteristic attitude; and when the flies settled within reach of their formidable enemies they were seized with unfailing exactitude and promptness between the two forelegs, and devoured with great avidity, not immediately, but after the lapse of a few minutes.\n\nI kept feeding the two mantises on flies of the same kind only\u2014each devouring about seven flies a day; and when the supply of these was nearly exhausted, I put in a few specimens of the common large green blow-fly (Lucilia sp.). These the mantises did not seem to relish\nmuch, for they attacked them with great reluctance\u2014appearing to be almost frightened of them\u2014and only devoured them when they could get nothing else.\n\nThe 7th and 8th of November being holidays, I did not attend office, consequently the insects were left without any food. Attending the Museum on the 9th instant, my first thought was of the mantises, and on going up to the cage I beheld a sight which fully illustrated the voracious nature of these insects, for during my absence the stronger one of the two, not finding other food, had deliberately made a meal of his weaker companion, devouring the entire abdomen, leaving the wings, legs, &c., of his unfortunate victim strewn about in the cage.\n\nMy next experiment on the remaining mantis was to find out if there were any kinds of insects that it would not eat, and having read that these raptorial Orthoptera have been noticed by different observers to devour caterpillars, grasshoppers, butterflies, beetles, and even small birds, I placed in the cage two living specimens of a bug (*Cyclopetia* sp.), which had been sent to the Museum from Poona as infesting *Leguminosae* and other species of *Erythrina*. Previously the mantis had been kept without food for two days as a just punishment for its crime, so on perceiving the bugs it seized the one nearest to it with great eagerness, and, turning the head from side to side, made two attempts to bite its victim, the taste of which, however, it appeared to dislike, showing signs of its dislike by wiping its mouth against its right foreleg several times. I watched the mantis, off and on, for about two hours, but excepting the two attempts it had made to eat the bug it never moved, till its victim lay dead between its two forelegs, when it let it drop.\n\nThe next day I placed in the cage some specimens of another kind of a bug (*Physomerus* sp.), which had been sent to the Museum from Poona as infesting *Convolvulaceae*. The flesh of this bug also appeared to be distasteful to the mantis, and though it destroyed several specimens, it would not eat them. Considering its condition at the time having been without food for several days\u2014I am inclined to think that bugs do not form the food of *Mantis*; but to prove this many more experiments would be necessary. Unfortunately my observations had to be abandoned here, as the mantis died soon after its refusal to eat the bugs, from sheer starvation I think.\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in December last:\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS, AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nAmsterdam.
