Materials for a Third Part are already in the hands of the Council, and it is believed that a new impetus will be given to the operations of the Society under the new President, who has both the means and the desire to forward the objects for which it was established.\n\nThe present Part is almost entirely occupied with A brief Notice of \"A new Arrangement of the Chronicles of Tsien,\" and a Key to its 329 Woodcuts of the Coins of China and neighbouring Nations, by C. B. Hillier, Esq., Chief Magistrate of Hongkong,\u2014a work in great repute among the Chinese, and which must prove interesting to antiquaries and numismatists of other countries. It has been brought out under the superintendence of Dr Harland, the Secretary at the time the work was presented to the Society, but for whose zeal it might have been much longer delayed. As the virtual editor, he desires not to be held responsible for the orthography of the Chinese names as given by the Translator. Those accustomed to the ordinary mode of representing Chinese sounds by means of the Roman Alphabet, will perceive that the letter r inserted throughout the work should in all cases be omitted. For the very beautiful and accurate Woodcuts, the Society is altogether indebted to the kindness of Dr Hobson of Canton, under whose care the blocks were engraved by a Chinese artist.\n\nThe only other paper contained in the present Transactions is a notice of the Manufacture of Magnetic Needles and Vermilion, (extracts from the Tung-teen-shaou,)\u2014by Dr W.

B. HILLIER, Esq.\n\nThe work appears to have been published by Wun Seang-shih about A.D. 1830, but to have been compiled by Charng Le-ying. It consists of a preface by Tarng-loh, written four years previously, of fifteen rules comprising the mode of compilation; of an enumeration and brief description of ten other Chinese works on Coins; of a general idea, of twenty books, forming the body of the work; and of a short account how the work came to be published. The wood-cuts and descriptions of Coins are arranged in order under headings of the Sovereigns of each dynasty or independent state, from the time of Yaou, B.C. 2356, to the close of the Ming dynasty in A.D. 1644\u2014a period of 4000 years; those of each reign being preceded by a summary of the leading events of the time. The wood-cuts are said to be fac-similes of the Coins they represent, carefully collated for the most part with the originals. It is interesting to trace in them the gradual improvement of the Chinese character from its rude pictorial to its present symmetrical, and as some think\nvery elegant form. The descriptions are principally made up of quotations from other books. In some the dimensions of the Coins are given, in some the weights, in some the amounts they were intended to pass current for, and in some all these and other particulars.\n\nThe inscriptions of the Coins are simple. In many cases they are made up of the name of the period or epoch of the reign (concerning which some explanation will be given,) and words signifying \"current money,\" or some such plain device: they are seldom abbreviated. The almost entire absence of legends perpetuating the features of celebrated persons, the likenesses of cities, places, or things, and of allegorical representations\u2014all so serviceable to literature in the case of other ancient Coins\u2014detracts much from the interest of the Coins of China. The importance of medals as collateral proof of the authenticity of history seems not to have occurred to the mind of our compiler; though this, if it have contracted his researches, may give additional weight to the testimony that he unconsciously records. The Coins, so far as one can judge from their representations, exhibit a low state of art; all seem to have been cast, none struck; and we see nothing like the refinement as well in art as in sentiment, which would have secured to other nations the unanimous admiration of posterity had their medals been the only relic of their greatness. The rough representation of a tortoise, a snake, a dragon, a bird, or a horse, and in three doubtful cases of men (in two of which the men might be mistaken for monkeys) seems to have exhausted the talent of the Chinese mints. The devices of the tortoise, the horse, and the indented mark, correspond curiously with those on the ancient Greek Coins. The horse was the symbol of Thessaly, the tortoise of the Peloponnesus; and the most ancient Greek Coins have an indented mark on one face and the figure of a tortoise on the other. Du Halde says, \"La Torture * * marque cela qui rampent \u00e0 terre; le Cheval d\u00e9signe cela qui y trennent moins, et qui s'\u00e9l\u00e8vent de temps en temps: et le Dragon volant est une image de cela qui sont tout \u00e0 fait d\u00e9tach\u00e9e de toutes les choses terrestres * * le Dragon est le symbol de la nation Chinoise de m\u00eame que l'Aigle etoit le symbol des Romains.\" He also gives an amusing reason why the Chinese have not as other nations placed the heads of Emperors on their Coins. \"Ce seroit, selon le genie de cette nation, une chose indecente et peu respectueuse pour la majest\u00e9 imp\u00e9riale, que le portrait du Prince pass\u00e2t continuellement par les mains des marchands et de la plus vile populace.\"\nBut however inferior in other respects, Chinese Coins yield to none in antiquity, if we are to believe that those of Yaou and Shun, (B.C. 2356) now exist. How they have been handed down to the present time is rather unaccountable, as it does not appear that the custom of burying money with the dead was ever prevalent in China. The Emperor Kang-he (A.D. 1662) is said to have made a collection of Chinese Coins, and to have made the series complete from Yaou to his own time. The most ancient medal of other countries now extant is supposed to be one of Alexander the First of Macedonia (501 B.C., about the time of Confucius); this is comparatively modern; and our earliest English Coins\u2014of the time of the Heptarchy\u2014sink into insignificance in point of antiquity. The existence of the alleged representations at least of such early Coins strengthens the opinion held by some that coined money had its origin in the remotest antiquity, in opposition to others who assign to it a much later date.\n\nThe epoch alluded to above is called \u570b\u865f (the national mark) or \u5e74\u865f (the year mark.) Previous to the Ming dynasty, it was not unfrequently changed several times during a reign. Thus in the reign of Kaou-koong of the Targ dynasty we find 14 different periods, each consisting of several successive years. The first period of this reign was named Yoong-hway, and consisted of six years; the second, called Heen-shing, lasted five years; so that the first year of the reign would be the first of Yoong-hway, the seventh the first of Heen-shing, and so forth. From the establishment of the Ming dynasty to the present time, one epoch only for each reign has been used; such is that of the present reigu Tau-kwarng. The names of these epochs seem to attach to the Emperors themselves, who have also their private and their posthumous names: an arrangement tending not a little to confuse Chinese history.\n\nWhen the metal of which the Coins are made is not mentioned, it seems to be generally taken for granted that it is copper, or some compound of which copper is the basis: the word \"copper\" is used throughout the work as the generic term for all such mixtures, \"red copper\" for the pure or nearly pure metal, \"yellow copper\" for a compound assimilating to our common brass, and \"white copper\" for tutenaugue. Iron Coins seem to have been first used in the reign of Woo-te of the Leang dynasty, A.D. 502. Lycurgus coined iron money about 884 B.C.\nThe Coins were issued from the mints bearing a nominal value fixed by the Emperor in reference to some given standard nowhere mentioned in the work under consideration. It seems that this standard accorded with the name of the Coin, (as formerly in the cases of the English pound and Roman as.) It was most likely a tsien weight of copper of ordinary purity, considered equivalent to a le weight of silver; that is, the proportional value of silver to copper was as 100 to 1. The denomination of the Coin generally far exceeded its actual value; in some reigns so much so as to render the Coins little better than tokens of value.\n\nThe rulers of China seem to have resorted to much the same unworthy expedients to raise money as the rulers of Western nations; altering the denomination or weight of the Coin, degrading the standard, or confiscating property dedicated to religious uses; nor does the true nature of money, as a valuable commodity and not the mere representative of value, appear to have been better understood. In the reign of She-tsoo of the Yuen dynasty, (Coblo\u00ef-khan A.D. 1280,) the device of Government paper was hit upon, and produced much confusion and ruin. Towards the close of the dynasty the currency became utterly valueless, and barter was the only mode of exchange practised.\n\nOn the whole, the book furnishes very little information; all worth recording, and I fear much more, has been extracted. The bulk of it is occupied with the historical events to be found in other works, and the remainder is little more than a dry description of the Coins now extant.\nWEIGHTS.\n\nAncient.\n\nAs mentioned in the work.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n10 \\text{ Shoo (grains of millet)} & = \\text{one Luy}. \\\\\n10 \\text{ Luy} & = \\text{one Choo}. \\\\\n8 \\text{ Choo} & = \\text{one Taze}. \\\\\n24 \\text{ Choo} & = \\text{one Leang}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nModern.\n\nAs mentioned elsewhere.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n10 \\text{ Le} & = \\text{one Fun}. \\\\\n10 \\text{ Fun} & = \\text{one Tsien}. \\\\\n10 \\text{ Tsien} & = \\text{one Leang}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nA leang (tael) \\(= 1\\frac{1}{2}\\) oz. avoirdupois.\n\nMEASURES.\n\nThe Tsun \\(= 1.4625\\) inches\n\nor \\(1.3125\\) inches\n\nor \\(1.27\\) inches\n\nor \\(1.333\\) inches\n\nor \\(1.265\\) inches\n\naccording to the standard used.\n\nThe Fun (part) \\(= 1/10\\)th Tsun.\n\nCAPACITY.\n\nThe Hwuh containing 10 Tow, the Tow containing about 12 catties (the catty equalling \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\) lb avoirdupois) of grain.\n\nThe dates taken from Medhurst's \"China, its state and prospects,\" and not calculated from the Cyclic years mentioned in the work.\n\nNOTE.\u2014In the descriptions of the Coins, the name of the Coin is printed in Small Capitals; the Dynasty within parentheses (); and the name of the Monarch in whose reign coined in Italics.\nNo. 1.\n\n1.

The first edition was published in Canton in 1816, and the latest in 1837. It contains a most miscellaneous variety of information, from the rearing of various domestic animals, fish included, to the preparation and grinding of pigments, preservation and beautifying of the hair and teeth; after which come various metallurgic and chemical processes.\n\n(1.)\u2014To make Needles point towards the South.\n\nTake of Vermilion, Orpiment, and Iron filings, of each, several Fun, (one Fun=6.4 grs. avoirdupois), reduce them to an impalpable powder, and mix together with blood from the comb of a white cock. Twenty or thirty needles are to be mixed up with this composition, well folded in paper, and placed in a furnace where they are to be exposed to the highest heat of a charcoal fire for seven days and seven nights. They are then to be taken out and folded up in a piece of flesh for three days, after which they may be removed and placed on the surface of water to ascertain whether they turn towards the South, and are fit for use.\u2014(Vol. 2, chap. 10, p. 3.)\n\nOf this method of making Magnetic Needles it may be observed, that, supposing the process to have the effect represented, it is probable that the continued heat alone is the active agent, and that the strange composition of vermilion, orpiment, iron filings, and blood, perhaps serves to protect the needles in some measure from the destructive action of a long-continued fire. The folding up in a piece of flesh certainly cannot have any effect.\n\n(2.)\u2014To make Vermilion.\n\nTake of Mercury 16 taels, and of Sulphur, (previously reduced to fine powder) 4 taels, put them into an earthenware jar, and cover them with a layer of moist salt 3 inches thick:\u2014when the materials are dry, the jar is to be placed in an iron pot. Take an iron lamp-cup and put it over the mouth of the jar, and at the place where it joins, bore a small hole with an iron wire, that the salt may not be too long in drying.* Now place the whole in a furnace, and having ready about 120 catties of Charcoal, at about 8 o'clock in the morning, light the fire, and extinguish it early on the following morning: at about noon, when the furnace is cool, take out the iron pot, and after breaking the earthenware jar, remove the melted mass. The mass must be ground exceedingly fine with about 30 pints of water, and then put into a basin, where it may be ground again; after it has completely subsided the water must be removed. The upper-\n\n* Or, in other words, to allow the escape of vapours given off when the mixture is heated.\nmost layer is called Pan-hung \u677f\u7d05; the second Te-urh-hung \u7b2c\u4e8c\u7d05, and the lowest, Sin-hung \u5fc3\u7d05. These layers may be separated by a knife and then dried in the sun. The Vermilion is now ready for packing away.\u2014(Vol. 3, chap. 12.)\n\nNotwithstanding the refinements of modern chemistry, no satisfactory reason has been given for the superior colour of Chinese and Dutch Vermilion, though various explanations have been suggested. In my opinion the beauty of this, as of many other Chinese pigments, is chiefly, if not entirely, owing to the excessive care and labour bestowed by them on the long-continued grinding and frequent elutriation with water.\nJOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.\n\nFEBRUARY 1st, 1848.\n\nThe Honourable A.
