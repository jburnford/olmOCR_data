H. M. S.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\nCANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY.\n\nLICENSE TO LAY PIPE UNDER RIGHT-OF-WAY.\n\nPERMISSION is hereby given by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company (hereinafter called the \"Company\") to His Majesty The King in right of the Dominion of Canada represented herein by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs (hereinafter called the \"Licensee\") to lay one inch pipe under the Company's right-of-way at a point near Fort Fraser Station, British Columbia, as shown by the red line on the plan hereto annexed (which is hereby declared to be a part hereof), to be used only for the purpose of conveying water to Fraser Lake Indian School:\n\nON THE FOLLOWING TERMS, which the Licensee hereby accepts and agrees to perform and abide by:\n\n1. The said pipe shall be of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineer's standard, properly fastened at the joints and the top of said pipe shall be below the frost line and not less than four feet below the base of rail.\n\n2. All work in connection with the laying, maintaining, renewing and repairing of said pipe and the continued supervision of the same, shall be performed by, and all costs and expenses thereby incurred be borne and paid by the Licensee, but no\nwork at any time shall be done in any manner so as to obstruct, delay or in any way interfere with the operation of any of the trains or traffic of the Company or any other Railway Company using the said railway.\n\n3. The Licensee shall at all times maintain the said pipe in good working order and condition and so that at no time shall any damage be caused to the property of the Company, or any of its tracks be obstructed or the usefulness or safety of the same for railway purposes be impaired or the full use and enjoyment as heretofore by the Company, or any other Railway Company using the said railway, be in any way interfered with.\n\n4. Before any work of laying, renewing or repairing the said pipe is begun, the Licensee shall give to the Local Superintendent of the Company at least ninety six (96) hours' prior notice thereof in writing so as to enable the Company to appoint an inspector to see that the work is performed in such a manner as in all respects will comply with this License. The wages of such inspector shall not exceed eleven dollars ($11.00) per day, to be paid by the Licensee, such payment to cover both wages and expenses. PROVIDED that the Company may at any time at the cost of the Licensee repair said pipe, or any part thereof, without notice to the Licensee should the Company's superintending official deem such repairs necessary or expedient, and the Company will render a bill to the Licensee for the cost.\nsuch work, based on reasonable rates to be fixed by the Company and the Licensee shall pay the same forthwith.\n\n5. The Licensee shall not have any claim against the Company for loss or damage by whomsoever caused to the property of the Licensee, whether due to the negligence of the Company, its employees, agents or otherwise.\n\n6. The Licensee shall indemnify and save harmless the Company of and from all damage or injury which may be caused to or sustained by the Company's roadbed, or any part thereof, or any of the rolling stock or other property of the Company, by reason of anything done or omitted to be done whether negligently or otherwise or in any manner based upon or arising out of or connected with this License and the Licensee shall indemnify and save harmless the Company from all claims, demands, actions, suits or other proceedings by whomsoever made, brought or prosecuted in any manner based upon, arising out of, or connected with this License, or anything done or left undone or maintained in any manner hereunder and notwithstanding that the same may be caused by or attributable to the negligence of the Company, its servants or otherwise.\n\n7. The Licensee shall pay to the Company for the privileges hereby given the sum of one dollar ($1.00) per annum and the said rental shall be due and payable in advance on the first day of November in each year during the continuance hereof.\n\n8. This License may be cancelled at any time upon one month's notice in writing signed by any\nsuperintending official of the Company being given to the Licensee. Upon the expiry of the notice period the Licensee shall disconnect the pipe and remove the same from the Company's property, and upon failure of the Licensee to do so forthwith the Company may remove said pipe at the cost of the Licensee.\n\n9. Neither this License, nor any right or interest thereunder is subject to any assignment or sub-lease without the consent in writing of the Company.\n\n10. Should any default be made by the Licensee in the payment of any money or the performance of any work or the fulfilment of any condition due hereunder the Company may cancel this License forthwith without notice and may disconnect said pipe or remove same from the right-of-way, and may collect the cost of such disconnection or removal from the Licensee.\n\nDATED this 22nd day of October A.D.1923.\n\nGRAND TRUNK PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY.\n\nWITNESS to signature of Licensee:\n\nLicensee.\nSir,\n\nIn connection with the new water system at the Fraser Lake Indian School and facilities for fighting fire I have been in consultation with the Principal, Rev. rather Coccola and we decided it was very desirable that at least two and preferably three hydrants should be installed on the outside of the building.\n\nI am advised by Mr Skelton, the foreman in charge of the present work, that these could be very easily installed at the inspection joints already provided in the pipe line.\n\nI may state that the boilers are fired with wood largely, and there has to be a large supply kept on hand and there is more or less danger of fire during the hot summer days from this source. Even a fire within the building might be more conveniently fought from the outside.\n\nI would therefore urge the Department to favourably consider this suggestion and have instructions given to enable the hydrants to be installed.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nReferring again to your letter of Sept 19/23 No 163/1/5 I beg to report further progress in connection with the installation of the new water system at the Fraser Lake Indian School as follows:\n\nThe concrete slab has been laid in the pump house, the pumps installed and water was delivered at the school on the 20th of January. Work is now proceeding on the storage tank, the heavy framed timber support above concrete foundation is all completed and the outside housing of the tank is well under way. When the housing is completed the tank timbers (all on the ground) will be assembled and the connection made with the pipe line which is all completed to the tank site.\n\nAt the lake shore work is proceeding to connect the lake water with the seepage bed and reservoir. This has been the most difficult undertaking of the whole system but with the lake at its very lowest point success is now assured. The foreman advises me that he expects to have the iron pipe rolled into position within two weeks when an abundant supply of water will be available at any season of the year.\n\nTrusting you will consider this progress satisfactory I have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir:\u2014 I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 21st, No. 163-1-5 and in respect to certain Vouchers sent in for payment in connection with the water system being put in at the Fraser Lake Industrial School by R. Moncrieff, Contractor. I beg to submit herewith all the received accounts for Voucher No. 1026 submitted on December 15th, which I trust are satisfactory.\n\nI am submitting also another Voucher No. 1056 with accounts all receipted. The Voucher mentioned in your letter, No. 1039 and amounting to $3335-22, receipted accts. will be sent forward in a few days as I have one account which I have not yet got a receipt for. As soon as this is received it will be forwarded on. However I am of the opinion that it will be perfectly satisfactory and perfectly in order to forward a cheque to Mr. Moncrieff covering this Voucher as I can assure you that everything is in order.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWJMOA/L.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inclose herewith documents and plan received from the Canadian National Railway Superintendent at Prince Rupert these being permission to lay a pipe under the Canadian National Railway track on the No. 4 Indian reserve at the Indian School near Fraser Lake. I trust that these will all be found satisfactory and in order.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWJMcA/L.\n**GOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA**\n\n**Department of Indian Affairs, British Columbia**\n\n**Stuart Lake, AGENCY.**\n\n**To R.

I am very pleased that the water system promises to be so satisfactory. I shall keep in mind your requirements in regard to accommodation for stock, grain products, and for the housing of farm employees.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. N. Coccola,\nIndustrial School,\nFraser Lake, B.C.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nSeldom if ever has it been my good fortune to write a letter which affords me such real pleasure, as does this occasion. It is therefore with a feeling of distinction, that I choose this opportunity to convey my sentiments towards you in particular and the Department of which you are the efficient head in general.\n\nUnder your able administration you have given a large amount of thought to this Institution of which I am the local incumbent and just at present we are once again experiencing the exemplification of your untold consideration for our Indian children at Fraser lake in the way of the up-to-date water system now installed.\n\nAs you are aware work started last fall under the management of Mr. Moncrief, who substituted to one Mr. R. Skelton and I wish to say that I do not think that the work could have been put in better hands. He Mr. Skelton was assisted by Indians with two exceptions and the work was rushed at such a rate, that on the declining days of last month water at the great joy was pumped direct from the lake into the main building.\n\nThe equipment on the lake shore is efficient in every way while the house is most picturesque. The water filtering through a sand and gravel bed and coming from three hundred feet from water edge gives an abundant supply and is of the very best.\n\nThe tank and tower on the hill is being rushed to completion and\nwe confidently expect that the water supply will be taken from it with the next few weeks.\n\nOn the completion of the work I doubt if any place in this fair Dominion can be found a water system superior to the one which your Department is now installing for this Institution.\n\nWhile we are most grateful for all that you have done and are doing I am ever mindful, as I am certain you are, of the pressing needs of a barn and proper accommodations for the working men for the coming summer.\n\nLast year we cut sufficient fodder to feed 22 head of cattle and five horses, besides thrashing some 575 bushels of grain, all of which had to be placed in a stack as we had no barn room.\n\nYou will readily see how badly we need this building and in such a time as to take of the fall harvest. This year our harvest will be much larger as a greater portion of the farm will be under cultivation. I would earnestly pray you to have the barn and employees quarters erected in proper season.\n\nOnce again asking you to accept my sincere appreciation to which I have the honor as well as the pleasure to include each and every ward beneath our roof.\n\nI am very gratefully yours,\n\nH. Coccola\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nIndian Affairs Ottawa\nOttawa, Feb. 12, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 5th instant suggesting that hydrants be installed on the grounds outside of the Fraser Lake Indian School for fire protection, I have to request that you furnish me with an estimate of the cost of having these hydrants installed.\n\nYou might also state what you consider the best means of having the work done. It will of course have to be withheld until the Spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. J.

The engineer at the school recommends three hydrants with 200 feet of 4 ply hose, two play nozzles, 4 hose wrenches, one hose reel on wheels.\n\nThe hydrants would cost about...........$85-00 each.\nThe hose about $1-00 per foot..\nThe nozzles $10-00 each.\nHose wrenches $1-00 each....\nHose reel on wheels. $59-00....\nHousing for hose reel. $50-00\nFreight about $10-00.\nInstalling hydrants etc....about $100-00.\nOr a total cost of about $770-00 including 10% added for emergencies.\n\nI would be glad if the Department would give this matter their consideration. The work I might say could be done at almost any time. There is very little frost in the ground now. I would be glad to have your instructions in this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWJMcA/L.\nOttawa, March 15,\n1924.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 28th ultimo with reference to the eaves troughs on the Fraser Lake School, I would ask you to please advise me if the Principal would undertake the work of removing the eaves troughs if same is authorized by the Department, providing any new materials required are furnished him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. McAllan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Fraser,\nB. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise you of the following: When I was up at the Industrial School the other day it was pointed out to me that the guttering on the edge of the roof of the building becomes clogged with snow and ice; the pipes running from various portions of the gutter become filled with ice and then the water overflows running down the pipes and freezing to the brick walls. There was quite a large amount of ice accumulated around each of the overflow pipes when I was there. I called Mr. Skelton in consultation in the matter and we came to the conclusion that if this condition was allowed to occur that in another year or two the portions of the brick walls would become very much deteriorated and it was decided to recommend to the Department that the whole of the guttering around the roof and overflow pipes be entirely removed. Perhaps the architects of the Department might know of some better solution of the trouble and if so it should be applied before another winter comes or the wall will certainly be injured. Discoloration is now in evidence where the ice thaws and breaks away. I would be glad if the Department would take this matter into consideration and issue instructions to remove the trouble before another winter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWJMOA/L.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of January 21st, No. 163-1-5 and in the matter of the account of R.

OF INDIAN AFFAIRS, APR 15, 1924, ARCHITECT]\nOttawa, April 8, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 10th instant advising me of the necessity of installing three fire hydrants outside the Fraser Lake Industrial School, together with 200 feet of fire hose with nozzles, reels, and other required accessories, at an approximate cost of $800.00, I beg to say that you are authorized to purchase the above mentioned articles on a competitive price basis, and arrange for the installing of the hydrants where already provided for on the water mains outside the building.\n\nIt is understood that the merchants who are to be invited to furnish quotations should be supplied with uniform specifications of the various articles to be ordered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLennan,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. J. Moillen, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Fraser,\nB.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, March 21, 1924.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Scott.\n\nThe Department was advised by Indian Agent McAllan of Fort Fraser, that it is very desirable that the Fraser Lake Industrial School be provided with reliable fire protection.\n\nAfter consulting with the Principal of the School it was considered that the installation of three water hydrants with 200' of hose would be sufficient to provide adequate protection against fire. The cost of this apparatus and its installation would amount to approximately $800. The apparatus would be installed on the outside of the building, and, in case of fire, would be very useful as fire is sometimes more conveniently fought from the outside of the building than the inside.\n\nProviding funds are available I beg to recommend that this request be given favourable consideration.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nYou have asked me to prepare a memo to the Minister requesting authorization for the above mentioned expenditure. Before I do this I beg to advise you that the necessary authority has already been obtained on the 10th of September last, for the complete installation of a water supply system, including an adequate fire protection system, at an estimated cost of $10,000 which amount would also provide for the installation of three hydrants referred to in my memorandum.\n\n[Signature]\nSir:\u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 13th, No. 163-1-5 and in the matter of removing the eaves troughs from the Industrial School at Fraser Lake, I had a conversation over the phone with the Principal and he says that he is not able to undertake the work as there will be some high scaffolding to do and he has not men available to do the work. I would suggest that Mr. Skelton who is presently working on the water system be requested to undertake the work as he was Foreman when the school was erected and is thoroughly acquainted with the character of the work and would take all necessary precautions to remove the eaves troughs without accident and without damage to the building. I would be glad of your further instructions in the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWJMcA/L.\nSir:\n\nAttached please find progress accounts amounting to $1341-62 in favour of R. Moncrieff in connection with the installation of the new water system at the Fraser Lake Industrial School.\n\nIn connection with this work I may say that the whole system is now almost completed. I think an additional $500-00 or $600-00 should complete the whole work.\n\nIn connection with the account for drain tiles and cement tiles in the Gayer & Connelly account for $69-90 I may say that they were used in the seepage bed connecting the pipe in the lake to the reservoir. I think that possibly that is the only item that needs special explanation.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWJMcA/L.\nOffice of the Stuart Lake Indian Agency,\n\nMarch 20th, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 1093, 1342, 62,\namounting to $1342.62 in favour\nof R.

(RG 10, Volume 6444, file 881-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Office\n\nFort Fraser May 16 1924\n\nReferring to the second last paragraph in your letter of the 7th inst No 163/1/5 requirements of barn would be accommodation for 24 head of cattle and six horses. A harness room and feed room for the horse stable. A silo of about 75 tons capacity. Loft to be as roomy as possible for hay and grain crop storage and fitted with hay fork and traveller. If possible a large cellar or basement should be provided beneath the main floor to store roots for cattle feed. Present water system should be connected up with barn nearest joint about 700 ft distant.- 2 inch galvanized pipe would do.\n\nSite chosen is fairly level but slope for good drainage near by.\n\nAttached are plans of a cattle barn which give a general idea of the class of building required but they would have to be modified to suit the requirements of both cattle and horses. I trust the Department can have this done. The ground measurements of the building would be roughly 35ft by 75 ft.\n\nTrusting I have given sufficient information for your purposes.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nP.S. When through with the blue prints submitted I would be pleased if you would return them as they are only loaned to me.\nIndian Office Ft Fraser P.O.\n\nMay 16 1924\n\nSir,\n\nAnswering your letter of the 7th inst No 163/1/5 I beg to state that I have just returned from a consultation with the Rev Father Coccola, Principal of the Fraser Lake Residential School, in which the various matters mentioned in your letter were discussed.\n\nWith reference to the plumbing fixtures, also cupboards, tables etc it is the Principals desire that these installations should have priority over the erection of a combined carpenter and blacksmith shop and I so recommend, but the erection of the latter should not long be delayed as the Indian parents are demanding more mechanical and technical instruction for the boys and in my opinion they are right.\n\nRe the erection of a barn\u2014the purchase of the various materials and supervision could be jointly undertaken by the Principal and myself provided we could engage the services of a competent and reliable foreman. In this connection I have spoken to Mr Rupert Skelton who has just completed the new water system under Mr Moncrieff. He is waiting for a few days to install the hydrants and outside fire protection system authorised by Department but this work will only keep him a very short time. If the Dept. could wire me to start preliminary work I could retain him\u2014for instance, it would be necessary to connect the present water system with the barn for which nearly 700 ft of 2 inch galvanized pipe sunk 5 ft in the ground would be necessary. Perhaps foundation work could be started while plans for superstructure were being prepared. Kindly wire me in this matter as competent men are difficult to get and being absent so much from the work I would not care to be responsible for its proper fulfillment unless I had confidence in the man in charge. With an efficient foreman the work could be satisfactorily handled on a day labour basis.\n\nBarn items are made the subject of a separate letter.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would also be glad to have your recommendation as to where advertisements should be placed when inviting tenders.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. J. McAllan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Fraser, B.C.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of March 11th, 1924, No. 163-1-5, granting authority to purchase certain building material for an ice house and wood shed at the Fraser Lake Industrial School. I beg to state that when the authority was received the Principal had already commenced work and had purchased considerable material, as it was necessary to have the building ready to receive the ice before the thaw took place. I therefore decided to allow the Principal to purchase the rest of the material required for the building. Some I think had been paid for and it was decided that the best plan would be to allow him to pay for the whole thing and send in accounts covering the $800.00 allowed by the Department for material for the building. The whole cost of the material amounted to much over $1000.00. The whole cost of the building including labour is well over $2000.00.\n\nOne of the accounts submitted contains an item for interest. Evidently Father Coccolo had not paid the bill within the time limit. I am instructed by the Principal to say that if it is contrary to the practice of the Department to pay interest on an overdue account he is quite willing that the Department should deduct this item of interest from the account. Trusting the Department will favourably consider this account even although the instructions in your letter were not; for reasons already stated carried out.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\n\nWJMcA/L.\nINDUSTRIAL SCHOOL\n\nFraser Lake, B.C.\n\nMay 16th, 1924\n\nW.J. McAllan Indian Agent,\nFort Fraser, B.C.\n\nRe Ice or Meat house, Wood shed combined with an Upstairs.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe building marginally quoted for which the Department allowed an expenditure of $800.00 for the material is touching completion.\n\nThe construction 20 x 52 stands on cement post four feet in the ground that is below frost, beautifully painted and entirely in harmony with other buildings.\n\nThe total cost of the building is estimated at $2200.00.\n\nThe Meat house 20 x 22 has three ply of lumber with space of 3 inches and tarred paper between. The Ice room is lined with galvanized iron on each side of the ice space of 30 tons capacity.\n\nThe Meat room is 8 x 10 with walls 9 feet high with a ventilator in the ceiling; the doors are air tight and we hope that the difficulty we had in past summers to keep meat for days is over.\n\nThe Wood shed is 20 x 30 with an Upstairs which could be used for carpenter shop or for bed room for the employees during the summer months, to that purpose we put in it a brick chimney. The steps leading to the entrance of the said upstairs are on the outside.\n\nI had to employ a skilful mechanic besides the foreman and the boys to assure complete satisfaction to the Department and myself.\n\nEnclosed find bills for materials of the construction.\n\nAmount $800.18.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nL.M. Coccollo\nPrincipal.\nOffice of the Stuart Lake Indian Agency,\n\nJune 12th, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 1160, amounting to $805.00 in favour of Rev. Father Gonzalo, Principal, Fraser Lake Industrial School, Lejco, P.O., B.C. (Ice house)\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 163-1-5 dated March 11th, 1924.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n## LOCAL PURCHASE\u2014ABSTRACT OF TENDERS\n\n**Tenders called:** Feb. 15th 1924 by letter phone.\n\n**Due:** April 1st, 1924\n\n**Opened:** Feb. 12th, 1924 by Rev.

If you consider it is essential that these stoves be installed, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the same and also for any stove pipe that may be required. They should be installed with a view to a minimum amount of fire risk. If possible, competitive prices should be obtained and the stoves purchased from the firm quoting the lowest price.

McAllan, Fort Fraser, B.C., for (School Supplies) (Fraser Lake Indian Residential School).\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 163-1-4 dated July 15th, 1924.

C. LaTrace, Prince Rupert, B.C. $5,250\n- A. P. Anderson, Prince Rupert, B.C. $4,976\n\nThe undersigned would recommend, pursuant to the requirements of Sub-section 2 of Section 36 of the Public Works Act, that the contract be awarded to the lowest tenderer, Mr. A. P. Anderson, for the amount of his tender as above cited, namely, $4,976.00 the same being reported by the architect of the Department as a fair and reasonable price for the work, funds for this purpose being available from Parliamentary appropriation.\n\nThe Board concur in the above report and recommendation, and submit the same for favourable consideration.\n\n[Signature]\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of Sept 17 No 163-1-5 in connection with the erection of a barn at the Fraser Lake Residential School it would appear to me from the plans that provision has not been made for the draining and flushing of the gutters in either the horse or cattle stables. The over accumulating liquids should have a ready getaway at all times, flushing with water is necessary also once a day.\n\nIt would not be advisable to have the liquids running out at any or either end of the building where main doors are.\n\nThe building stands east and west with cattle stalls east. Ground declines north about one foot in sixteen. I suggest four inch tile drain between cattle and horse gutters, connected up with both and continued under north side footing and beyond for about 70 feet. Subsoil is very hard clay. I have had no time or opportunity to make enquiries as to cost of tiles but think job can be done efficiently for between one hundred and one hundred and fifty dollars. Kindly wire instructions.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nW.J.

D.I.A.\n\nOttawa, Oct. 13, 1924.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of May 7th, #163-1-5 and the last paragraph thereof dealing with my letter of the 28th of April, and an application to have the eaves troughing removed from the new School building as the overflow pipes were accumulating vast quantities of ice during the winter and endangering the walls of the building. I beg to say that the carpenters are now at work at the school barn and would do what removing is to be done on a basis of current wages for time occupied. The Contractor, Mr. Anderson suggests that instead of removing the whole troughing that the pipes or conduits where they connect with the eaves should only be removed and the apertures plugged with wood or other substance. This would distribute the water and the same end would be attained as if all the troughing was removed. I suggest his plan should be adopted as it will be I think fully as effective as my original suggestion and will entail infinitely less expenditure. Kindly advise by return mail if I may undertake this work.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWJMcA/L.\nSend the following Night Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, Oct. 22,\n1924.\n\nW.J.

Principal at the School and myself are asked to be inspectors of the construction on the barn now building. I beg to say that the Rev. Father Coccolo is at present convalescing at Vancouver and I have asked the Assistant Principal to undertake the duties of inspector along with myself and issue certificates of payment on the work. I am therefore to enclose certificate No. (1), dated Oct. 15th, asking for a payment of $2000.00.\n\nI might say that the work is going on well. The most of the material is on the ground, the foundation all in and studding erected for the whole building and part of the rafters in place. I therefore trust that the Department will forward the amount asked for to the Contractor at Prince George, B.C.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nW.J.McA./L.\nRev. Father Plamondon,\n\nSir\n\nI have inspected the Septic Tank, and find it in first class condition, but an improvement can be made at the end of the Outlet Pipe.\n\nFollowing is a description in detail.\n\nThe first Tank contains 6 ft of water covered with about 3 inches of seam, which is in a state of fermentation, there is about 3 inches of soft sediment at the bottom.\n\nThe second portion of the Tank carries 3 ft 4 in. of water, and is free of seam and sediment, the water level is the same in both sections of the Tank, but the depth of the tanks is not equal. The water leaves the outlet pipe at the same rate at which the water enters the Tank and the height of water does not vary.\n\nThe Tank is placed at the top of a bank, being well protected from frost. The Outlet Pipe empties about 20 feet below the Tank the end being placed in a bed of natural gravel. Rocks were laid at the end of the pipe and this allows some water to come to the surface where it runs on top about 10 feet before soaking in the ground again, this allow a bad smell to pass off. The greater portion of the water soaks through the gravel to a lower level, this water is perfectly filtered and free from smell.\n\nI would suggest that three short trenches should be dug in the gravel and filled in loose, taking the form of a broad arrow. The gravel at the end of the pipe should be covered with a layer of clay tamped down to prevent the water coming to the surface. Clay for this purpose is available within a few yards of the job. Should this method be followed the water would be filtered and should be perfectly free from smell.\n\nThe natural lay of the ground with a deep layer of gravel gives an opportunity to make a first class filter bed at a very low cost, and makes it possible to dispose of sewerage water for a number of years with an entire absence of smell.\n\nI would suggest that this information be forwarded to the Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\n(Signed) Yours respectfully,\n\nH.

Unfortunately the snow came on quicker than we anticipated and it was quite impossible for the Contractor to complete the painting of the roof but that is the only uncompleted portion of the work. This they will do in the spring.\n\nThis present certificate calls for $2600-00. This will make a total of $4400-00 paid the Contractor, leaving $576-00 to pay for the painting of the roof of the barn, besides which I suppose the Department will hold the deposit of the Contractor. The labour and material required to complete the contract; that is the painting of the roof would be $160-00.

Father Coccolo, Principal of Fraser Lake Residential School, Lejac, P.O., B.C. I would strongly recommend that the Principal's request be granted as the roof of the boiler room is far too flat. The estimated cost of this work would be in the neighborhood of $250-00.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nFor Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nWFM/L.\nSir,\n\nCOPY\n\nIndustrial School,\nLejac, B.C.\n\nMay 18th, 1925.\n\nMr. W.J. McAllan,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Fraser, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter the conversation with regard to the roof over the boiler room broken in by the ice falling from the roof of the main building, I had a carpenter to look at it who said, after inspection, \"that the roof was too flat\", and \"having only a 2\"x 4\" rafters 18 feet long and covered with rubberoid could not stand pressure.\"\n\nI asked him what could be done to repair and consolidate it.\n\nHe answered that the only way for a cheap job would be to raise the roof to its level then new rafters 2\"x 6\", and galvanized roofing should replace the rubberoid and if that is not done at once the old roof will collapse on the pipes and cause much damage.\n\nShall I bring to your attention the condition of the eave troughs which keep the ice on the edge of the roof and forced the water back between the walls of the central building and the wings so much so that the water damaged the rooms on the first floor.\n\nThe eave trough have to be removed before the cracking of the walls will take place.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nN. Coochoo,\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 17th ultimo with reference to the extension of the water supply system to the barn at the Fort Fraser Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I am pleased to advise you that you may arrange to have this work performed in accordance with your estimate and recommendation submitted with your letter.\n\nAs it is not the intention of the Department to assume any responsibility with regard to charges for clerical work in connection with this work, it is desired that the amount of $700 provided be not overexpended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJo D. McLean,\nAste. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFort Fraser, B.C.\nMay 4, 1925.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nThere is no water in the barn at the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School and the stock must cross fields under cultivation to secure a drink. A proper water supply was provided two years ago for this school, but the barn has never been connected up. I wish to recommend that water be placed in the barn, on a day labour basis, under the supervision of the Indian agent. The cost is estimated at $700.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir,\n\nI have received a letter from Rev. Father [Name], Principal of the Fraser Lake Residential School which I quote in full as follows:\n\nRe Water To Barn:\nHaving reference to the marginal noted, I take this occasion once again to place before you for your consideration the matter of water in the stable. The necessity of having water in the barn is now evident as the snow is now leaving and the stock must cross the road on their way to water which are hay lands and I am certain that you will readily perceive the destruction they are doing, which could be avoided by bringing the water into the barn. Undoubtedly it is the intention of the Department to do this at some time, if so, why not at once, which would mean considerable less destruction and a large amount of unnecessary work.\n\nTo this end I am making the liberty to attach an estimate of cost of labour and material and would add that I am in a position to superintend this work if the Department so desires.\n\nI would suggest that a two inch pipe be run from the water tank to a point some thirty feet from the barn, at said point, place a hydrant for fire protection, then reduce to one inch to a point six feet inside the barn underground, then carry a pipe to ceiling thence to water troughs, one for the cows and one for the horses, thus arranged to drain as to prevent freezing. A one inch branch pipe could be taken from the two inch pipe to supply the engineer's offices and other buildings which may be erected in the future.\n\nTrusting that you will bring this matter to the attention of the Department at once, \"I am,\n\nYours truly,\nN. Coccolo,\nPrincipal.\n\nI would strongly recommend that the Department undertake this work as it is really very necessary if the hay lands are to be protected.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWPM/L.\nESTIMATED COST OF LABOUR & MATERIAL TO PLACE WATER IN THE STABLE.\n\nDigging 203 yards of trench 5 feet deep........$410-00\n\nMan hole. 25-00\nHydrant. 12-00\n350 ft. 2\" Galvanized Pipe. 129-00\n350' ft 1\" \" \" 59-00\n20 ft 3/4 \" \" 2-50\n20 ft. 1/2 \" \" 1-70\n5 Brass Water Taps 15-00\nOne stop and Waste Valve with rod. 8-00\n26 assorted pipe fittings 6-00\n12 assorted nipples 1-50\n50 Hours work for Pipe Fitter. 50-00\n50 hours work for helper. 25-00\n10% to cover clerical work etc. 74-50\n\nTotal.... $620-00\n\nNote:- Prices are taken from Crane Co.

A lumber building 16' X 50' would give accommodation for about 300 hens and would not cost a great deal of money. I would be glad if the Department could put in their estimates an amount to cover this matter. However I wish to advise the Department that the Blacksmith Shop and the Carpenter Shop is the first movement that I want to see erected at the school, but if the Department can see their way clear to put in the estimates a sufficient amount to cover the erection of a chicken house I would be pleased.

Having no granary we stored it in a corner of the barn, the steam from the stock caused the grain to germinate. You see at once by that the imposing necessity of a granary.\n\nSame must be said for what happened to our roots. It is true 4 years ago we built a small temporary cellar, now that the area of cultivated land has tripled and we intend to develop it farther on, we need a permanent and larger cellar capable of containing the returns from the garden.\n\nWe think that to save expenses and to have things at hand a granary with a cellar underneath communicating with the barn could be built attached to the said barn on the North side according to sketch here enclosed for the cost of $900.00\n\nPlease return the sketch.\n\nHoping that you will give consideration to this matter,\n\nI remain your humble servant.\n\nA. Coccoloa O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 23, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing a plan of a granary and root cellar which is desired for the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School. I note you estimate the cost at $900. Before giving consideration, the Department would be pleased to have a statement from you and one from Mr. Indian Agent Moore, concerning what are the most important needs at your institution this year. At the time our Estimates were prepared, your requirements were listed by the Church representatives as follows: Completion workshop, erection of silo, cow shed, hogpen and root cellar. Certain funds will be available for these purposes. I should be pleased if you and Mr. Moore would make a joint recommendation concerning these improvements, listing them in order of their relative importance and estimating their costs.\n\nThe Indian Agent is receiving a copy of this letter for his information and guidance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. N. Coccolin, S.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nFraser Lake Indian Res. School,\nLejac, B.C.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your communication of the 23rd ult. to the Rev. Father Coccolo, Principal of the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School, File No.163-1-5 copy of which I have received I beg to inform you that I have gone into the matters mentioned in your letter with the Rev. Principal and beg to advise as follows:\n\nIn going over the most important requirements of the Fraser Lake School this year I find that a set of new batteries for the lighting plant is the outstanding one. The present batteries which were put in when the school was built have been in constant use for the last five years, apparently these batteries were just large enough to supply the needs of the school alone without taking in the barn or any of the other out buildings, in fact Mr. Allen the Engineer informed me that the batteries have been carrying a maximum load and that when asked to do that their life is considerably shortened. The battery question was brought to my attention last fall by the Principal and after discussing the matter with him and the Engineer we thought that they would last for at least another year, however they have been getting worse during the winter until now they are far from satisfactory and the light in the school is anything but good. To my mind the batteries at present in use are too small and for that matter were too small right from the beginning except for the main building but when we consider that the barn is not lighted by electricity owing to the fact that the batteries are not strong enough to carry the additional load we can readily see how the fire risk is increased by using oil lamps around hay and straw, in fact during my first visit to the school after my appointment as Indian Agent I mentioned the fact of the barn not being lighted by electricity to Father Coccolo and asked him why it was so which he replied that his batteries could not supply any more lights than were being used in the School Building. I understand that a set of batteries suitable for a plant such as the Fraser Lake Indian School will cost in the neighborhood of $2000-00. This amount may seem large but a new set of batteries will be necessary before next fall and I think it wise to put in a set that\nwill carry the full load and supply the barn and other out buildings as well, rather than purchasing a set the same size as in use now for it will only mean a repetition of the trouble in another few years as well as not giving power enough to light the barn etc.\n\nThe next item in importance is the completion of the Carpenter and Blacksmith Shop started last year and still in an unfinished condition. The amount necessary for this work will be approximately $800-00.\n\nNext in importance is a granary with root cellar underneath. I saw the plans of the proposed granary as submitted by Father Coccollo to the Department and think it a good one and one that should meet with the approval of the Department. No doubt you are aware that a good root cellar is a very important item in an institution such as the Fraser Lake School, especially in a climate such as the one we have in this district. The cost of this granary and root cellar will be in the neighborhood of $1000-00.\n\nThe next item of importance is the erection of a silo and one large enough to fill the want will cost around $400-00 including the cement foundation.\n\nThe erection of a hog pen is next in importance and one large enough to house six brood sows with litters and a boar with a feed room at the end should be something along the plan adopted. No estimate on this work has been given.\n\nThe completion of the cow shed which was started by Father Coccollo last fall is next in line. This building is close to the barn and is used for young and dry stock to feed and stay in during the winter with free access to water and pasture. To complete this building will cost about $500-00.\n\nIn conclusion I would strongly recommend that the above items be granted in the order they are given.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nyour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nLejac, B.C.\n\nJuly 17th, 1925.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nIn Account With:\nH.G.

Kindly attach them to a statement which should show the amount of the advance and the expenditure incurred as per receipts, vouchers and cheques. The statement should be certified by you and should be forwarded to the Department together with the other papers.\n\nI have to point out that seemingly the charges for services of pipe fitter and helper are incorrect.

A cheque, No. 1111 for $700.00 in favour of the Bank of Commerce, went forward to Vanderhoof on the 11th June to meet expenses.\n\nI have to request that you will be good enough to see that the $700.00 mentioned is accounted for without delay. Proper vouchers should be submitted to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paret\nChief Accountant.\n\nR.H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nOttawa, March 23, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your S-2 of the 15th instant and I note that manual training instruction cannot be given the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School pupils until the shop building is completed and tools are provided. As soon as the new Vote is available, instructions concerning the electric light batteries and completion of the workshop will be directed to you. I note your estimate of $750 for manual training tools. This seems quite excessive and the Rev. Principal should be informed that the school will have to provide whatever is necessary to commence the instruction in carpentry.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Fraser, B. C.\nOttawa, March 19, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, recapitulating the most important needs at the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School. The Department is glad to have this information, and, if an appropriation for this school is made by Parliament, instructions concerning what can be allowed will be directed to the Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. M. Coccola, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nFraser Lake Indian Res. School,\nLejac, B.C.\nSir:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 23rd ult. File No. I68-I-5, we discussed with our Indian Agent Mr. Moore the most important needs of our Institution.\n\nFirst. We found the necessity of renewing the battery for the lighting plant.\n\nLast year we noticed that the lights were dim but we hoped to overcome the trouble by overhauling the cells. In doing it we found them to contain a thick sediment and the disintegration of the Positive plates to be too far advanced to allow repair. At present the light is very poor.\n\nThis battery when first installed was to supply light for the main building the only one standing then, but when the Laundry and the Chapel were built it became too small for the number of lights in service and was overtaxed.\n\nNow as the light is to be extended to the barn and workshop and other outside buildings the size of the battery has to be increased also. A battery of 320 Ampere Hours would be more economical to operate and should have longer life.\n\nOur engine is IO H.P. Special Electric and our generator is 5 Kilowatt at 125 Volts. The switch board has two Amperage Rheostats and it is so arranged that we could charge the large battery successfully to supply light for Barn and other buildings all at the cost of about $2000.00.\n\nI suggest that the firm who is to install the new battery should send a competent man electrician and guarantee the work.\n\nSecond. The next improvement of importance would be a Granary with Root cellar underneath as per plan sent for about $900.00.\n\nThird. Then the completion of the workshops for about $750.00.\n\nFourth. A hogpen to cost about $1000.00.\n\nFifth. And last the completion of the cowshed which I began to build last Fall to be finished as to be in harmony with the other buildings with paint and shingle roof, it would cost $600.00.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN. Coccola\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6444, file 881-5, part 3)\nOttawa, March 17th, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your J-5 of the 8th instant, recapitulating the needs at the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School.

The battery consists of 50 cells, 240 amp. hr. The positive and negative plates as well as the separators are all spoiled, I have been thus informed by Mr. Allan the Engineer. As explained in my letter of March 8th last to the Department, I am satisfied that the batteries at present in use at the School are too small even though they were in first class condition, because they are and have been carrying the maximum load which has a bad effect on any battery and tends to shorten its days of usefulness to a considerable extent. The Rev. Principal has informed me that he has been in communication with an Electrician called Mr. Alex Nash of Prince George on the matter and Mr. Nash has guaranteed to give the Principal satisfaction should he be allowed to install a new set of batteries. It seems desirable that this man should, if at all possible, get the work as he is in business locally and can give better service on that account. I would be pleased if the Department would take this matter into consideration at the earliest possible date and advise what action they wish to take.\n\nRegarding the cost and necessity of providing a granary and root cellar as more important to the satisfactory conduct of the School than the completion of the Work Shop, I beg to inform you that I went into this matter with the Principal and he is still of the opinion that the granary and root cellar should be attended to first. I can easily see the Principal's point in this case as he is naturally looking to the most economical way of operating the school, if the granary and root cellar is completed this summer it means that the Principal will have a place to store...\nSir,\n\nhis grain, roots and vegetables for winter consumption, while on the other hand if it is not completed he will have to do the same as he has been doing, viz., buy these commodities wherever he can and at whatever price offered.\n\nOn the other hand, completing the Carpenter Shop is just as vital, from the point of view of satisfactory manual training to the boys at the School. As you know this building was started last year and partially completed and while admitting the necessity of the granary and root cellar, I am still of the opinion that the Department should try and finish one job before starting another. So far as the Principal and myself agreeing on which of these buildings should be completed this year I am afraid it cannot be done, for as I have already explained, the Principal is looking at it from one angle and I from another. I am just as anxious as the Principal is to see the granary and root cellar completed but in fairness to the Department and the pupils I think that as the Carpenter Shop was considered to be of first importance last year it should still keep its place.\n\nIf the Department could see its way clear to complete both these buildings this year it would be filling a long felt want in the successful operation of the Institution as both buildings are of equal importance depending on which view point one wishes to take.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nRHM/L.\nSend the following Day Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nCanadian Fairbanks-Morse Company,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nQuote lowest price f. o. b. Vancouver for replacing positive and negative plates and separators in fifty-six cell two hundred and forty ampere hour storage battery which I understand you supplied in October nineteen twenty-one to Contractor Moncrieff for installation Indian residential school at Lejac, Fraser Lake.\n\nJ. D. McLEAN,\nIndian Affairs.\nOttawa, May 31, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your S-2 of the 19th instant, with reference to improvements at the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School. The Department will arrange in the immediate future with the Fairbanks-Morse Company of Vancouver, to ship, freight prepaid, to the Rev. Principal at Endako, positive and negative plates and separators for the present storage battery at the school. Our Architect considers that this battery is large enough, if properly used. You may arrange to have Mr. Alex. Nash, Electrician, of Prince George, install the batteries and see that the system is in good working order. The account for the batteries should be certified by you, after the equipment is received and found to be in satisfactory condition. You should prepare a voucher in favour of Mr. Nash, when the installation is properly completed.\n\nI note that the Rev. Principal urges the provision of a granary and root cellar as more important than the completion of the carpenter shop. You should have him prepare a list of the materials necessary to erect the building, as shown on the plan he submitted to the Department in February, last. The construction is to match the present barn, to which the root cellar and granary would be attached. He should also estimate the cost of the expert labour that will be necessary.

Principal yesterday when I was at the School and we came to the conclusion that it might be unsatisfactory to get the supplies for the batteries from one Company and ask another to do the labour and install the batteries, owing to the fact that in case the batteries were not satisfactory when installed that one could blame the other and the Department would be left, as it were, between two stools. Therefore I would respectfully recommend that the Department instruct Fairbanks ore to do the installing as well as supplying the new parts for the battery. I would like to point out that the Rev. Principal told me yesterday that there would be about six new jars necessary as well as both positive and negative plates and separators, apparently the jars have been broken, one now and another again, until there are six new ones required at the present time. I would therefore suggest that these six jars be purchased at the same time as the other material.\n\nThe Rev. Principal is going to give me a list of the materials necessary to build the granary and root-cellar. The estimated cost of the skilled labour will also be included. In this connection I would like to mention that the school closes on July 20th, next for six weeks and that unless work is got under way very soon we will derive little or no benefit out of the School Staff and older boys for the unskilled labour necessary for the erection of this building.\n\nI note your remarks re the finishing of the Carpenter Shop which will stand in abeyance for the time being.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nHon.

Box 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nMarch 1, 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen I paid my last visit to Fraser Lake School last fall, the Reverend Principal, Father Coccola pointed out to me that the cold storage building was not working very satisfactorily. It is, of course, important that this storage plant works well, as this particular school has to keep considerable quantities of stores on hand at one time, owing to their not being able to purchase locally. The following is an extract from a letter from the Reverend Principal regarding the installation of a refrigerator plant at the school:\n\n\"Knowing as you do the necessity of a refrigerator plant I wrote to Edmonton and Vancouver for plans. After much correspondence the Linde Co., of Vancouver are willing to install a plant for $1465.00, ourselves to supply the three horse power engine necessary to run it and which we have on hand. The building to be used will be our present meat house with some modifications, but that can be done by our carpenter instructor, and the boys. The advantage of a plant at once is to save putting up ice which costs us $300. every year. If the Department has not the funds available at present to go ahead with this work, I would like authority to do the work with my own funds and then be reimbursed by the Department as soon as the new appropriation is available.\"\n\nMr. Moore, Indian Agent, in commenting upon this matter states that he can appreciate the position that the Principal is in, and if there is any possible way that this addition can be made with the present equipment of the school, he would certainly recommend that it be done. Mr. Moore states that when he submitted the estimates for his Agency for 1927-28 to Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn, he included the sum of $1400.00 for a plant of this nature. He stated that if the Department would agree to this disbursement and give the Reverend Principal reasonable assurance that the item in question would be available later on, that the job be commenced right away.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, I certainly think that the installation of a refrigerator plant at the school would be a great improvement, and I should certainly like to see it done some time or other. However, I do not wish any of these estimates to upset the possibility of the work commencing on the Lytton School, or the final wing of the Kamloops School. Having in view the fact that the Reverend Principal states that he would save $300.00 every year, some agreement might be made whereby the school, having in view the fact that they are saving this money, contribute something towards the cost, apart from the fact that they are willing to contribute the work, and of course, the cost of running the engine. However, it is not a very large sum in question, and possibly the Department might see fit to pass this estimate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6444, file SS1-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 19th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, relative to the extra desks required for the use of the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School and explaining the need for this equipment. It is noted that the half-day system is not in use at this school but that the pupils attend classes throughout the day and that you are satisfied that twelve extra desks are necessary. The Department will approve of the purchase of this number of single desks, size No. 4.\n\nThe desks at present in use at the school were obtained from the Globe Furniture Company Limited, Waterloo, Ontario. The British Columbia agents of this firm are Messrs. Clires Ltd., 1150 Hamilton Street, Vancouver. You may place the order with this firm for the above number and size of single school desks. You should give them full particulars as to shipping directions, etc., and obtain accounts from them in duplicate, covering the cost. Please arrange with them to include in their price for the supplying of the desks the freight charges and, when the desks have been received, if in good condition, you should certify the same and send to the Department for payment. Please give the matter of the purchase of these desks your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo File No. 163-1-5 for which I thank you.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter I beg to advise that the half-day system has not been adopted so far at the School. The Principal informs me that owing to the fact that the children first go to School without any knowledge whatever of English that he finds that it is necessary for them to be in the class room twice daily to show any progress at all, he also adds that the majority of them do not remain long enough in the School as the parents always find some reason to get them away as soon as they are big enough to be of any use.\n\nI asked the Principal if it was possible for him to get along without the desks asked for, quoting the remarks contained in the last paragraph of your letter, but he told me that he requires at least one dozen single desks right away to accommodate the present number of pupils. Consequently I am satisfied that the desks are necessary in view of the information given me by the Rev. Principal and I would recommend that twelve desks instead of twenty-four be sent to the Principal as soon as possible.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 9, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to confirm the following night letter to you of yesterday's date:\n\n\"Inspector Pragnell reports that repairs are urgent behind eavetroughs at Fraser Lake School. You may incur expenditure approximately $275 in this connection. Get competitive prices for materials and keep time sheets in duplicate for labour engaged.\"\n\nInspector Pragnell states that there is some faulty construction at the Fraser Lake School, and that this is causing considerable trouble and annoyance as well as destruction every spring. He also states that immediately behind the eavetroughs there are certain boards missing, and that on account of the thawing and freezing each spring the eavetroughs fill up and then back up under the eaves and down inside the walls, damaging the plaster. He recommended that, in order to avoid a recurrence of the existing conditions this coming spring, the repairs required to the eavetroughs be immediately carried out. As instructed in the telegram above referred to, you should arrange to have these repairs to the eavetroughs carried out at the earliest possible date that weather conditions will permit.\n\nYou should purchase any materials required, after obtaining competitive prices, and you should keep time sheets, in duplicate, for the labour engaged. The total expenditure should not exceed the amount stated. When the work has been completed, please forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the material and time sheets for the labour employed, which should also be certified by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

On account of the thawing and freezing, every Spring the eaves troughs fill up and then back up under the eaves and down inside the walls, doing considerable damage to plaster and everything else. It was not noticed that these boards were missing until one of the eaves troughs was removed for some purpose or other.\n\nMr. Agent Moore informs me that he has asked for an estimate and finds that it will run between $250.00 and $300.00 to have it done. He states that he included this expenditure in his estimates which he sent to Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn last September. He has heard nothing further in the matter and he wants to avoid the recurrence of the flooding and damage to the kalsomine and plaster which occurred last Spring, by dealing with the matter immediately. I consider the matter urgent and should be done straight away, and I shall be much obliged therefore, if you see fit, if you would authorize this. I think it would be best if you would communicate with Mr. Moore direct, probably by wire, as Spring is coming and it should be done before a thaw occurs.\n\nI would have written you before upon the matter, but I have been laid up for the last week, sick with Flu, and could not, therefore, deal with the matter.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo.

I would like to advise you that this matter has brought home to me, very forcibly, the fact that some system of \"follow up\" will have to be adopted by myself in the office to prevent a recurrence of a like nature.\n\nYou can readily see that in the case of the above letter, how easy it was for me to overlook the matter altogether, having not received a reply to my first letter to the Roadmaster and it is to prevent such a thing happening again that I am writing you.\n\nI am of the opinion that the Department have a system of their own and which would be applicable to Agency Offices. If so, I would be grateful to have any information you might care to give me on the matter, as well as any suggestions or advice that you might give. I understand that the \"Desk Calendar Pad System\" is very good and would, I think, be just the very thing for the office and if these could be procured from the Department of Printing and Stationery, I am sure that it would supply my requirements. However, I will be guided by your advice and instructions in the matter and any information you might care to give will be gratefully received.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

File No. 163-1-5 regarding an account from the Canadian National Railways covering the cost of clearing snow from the switch at the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School. I very much regret not having replied to the letter written under date of August 30th last regarding the same matter but in explanation thereof I am attaching hereto copies of correspondence that I have sent to the Roadmaster of this Division regarding the above account and which I have not as yet received a reply to. Please note that I have sent another letter to him by even mail asking for the desired information as soon as possible.\n\nAs explained to the Roadmaster in my letter, I found that on checking the account over with the Rev. Principal at the School we were both of the opinion that the account had been paid by the Principal himself for he informed me that previously he was in the habit of paying this expense himself, consequently I wanted to find out from the Roadmaster if there had been a duplication before sending in a Voucher for the amount or replying to your letter. However, the matter escaped my memory owing to the fact that a reply had not been received from the Roadmaster. I am still of the opinion that the account has been duplicated but as soon as I hear from the Roadmaster I will immediately take whatever action is necessary.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nRHM/L.\nSir,\n\nI wrote you under date of September 15th last regarding an item of $5-68 for clearing snow at the spur at the Indian School at Fraser Lake during the month of January 1926. As no reply has been received from you to this letter I am again requesting that you look into this matter and advise at the earliest possible date.\n\nA copy of my previous letter is presented herewith:\n\n\"I have received a bill from the Department which was sent to me by the Canadian National Railways for clearing snow from the switch at the Indian School during the month of January 1926. The account amounts to $5-68 and the bill No. is 1256. In going into this matter with the Rev. Principal Cocolo he showed me an account for the same amount which was paid by him to the Agent at Eniako Mr. Kyle for work that was supposed to have been done in February 1926. It seems to us that this account was duplicated although the number of the account paid by Father Cocolo was 1256. I would be pleased if you would kindly look into this matter and if these are two separate accounts please advise us at your earliest convenience when the January account will go through for payment.\"\n\nKindly look into this matter at your earliest convenience and advise if there has been a duplication of accounts in this case for it seems to me that there has, for owing to the exceptionally light snow fall last winter I cannot see why it should be necessary to clear the snow off the switch so frequently.

The Principal's proposal to have the installation made at the present time, so that a saving of approximately $300 per year in the matter of ice supply can be made, commends itself to the Department. Before approving of the scheme, however, and making an offer of reimbursement for this expense, I should be glad if you would let me have without delay literature or other information concerning the nature of the installation proposed by the Linde Company, of Vancouver.

SCOTT.\n\nA few weeks ago, Mr. Inspector Pragnell strongly recommended a refrigerator plant at the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School. The Rev. Principal wishes to proceed with the installation of an ammonia freezer, at a cost of approximately $1700. The plant, itself, is worth $1465; doors, etc., for the cold storage room, approximately $250. The Principal hopes that the scheme will effect a saving of about $300 a year in the matter of ice supply. Mr. Orr recommends the scheme.\n\n$1600 is available for improvements at this school this year. It is the intention to erect a small hogpen, a silo and a cow shed. In a letter dated the 24th ultimo, the Rev. Principal states that the refrigerator plant is the most urgent of all their requirements. In view of these recommendations, I have to suggest that the Rev. Principal be informed that the Department will give a grant of $1600 if he meets the entire cost and forwards to us receipted accounts. He would be given to understand that the construction of the small outbuildings cannot go forward this year.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nMarch 30th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI have received a letter from Colonel Pragnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies, with reference to the installation of a refrigerator plant at the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nApparently the Department wish certain information on the plant which the Rev. Principal had in view as a suitable one for the Institution and Inspector Colonel Pragnell instructed me to get all the Information that I could from the Principal and forward it direct to the Department and quote your letter to him of March 8th, File No. 165-1-5.\n\nUpon receipt of the Inspector's letter I immediately wrote to the Principal and by last mail I received from him a letter, copy of which I attach herewith, as well as plans specifications etc of the plant proposed.\n\nI would respectfully draw the attention of the Department to the last paragraph of the Rev. Principal's letter wherein he asks for the sketch to be returned as soon as the Department is through with it and hoping that the Department can see its way clear to take this matter into consideration at an early date.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCOPY\n\nIndustrial School,\nLejac, B.C.\n\nMarch 24th, 1927.\n\nR.H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just come back from Prince Rupert and find your letters of March 14th, D-2 and March 19th, S-2.\n\nAt your request I am enclosing the specifications and tenders of the Linde Co which sums up the correspondence I had with the Company. The reason why I signed them is that if approved by the Department they could be forwarded direct to the head office. We have here another copy of that contract.\n\nI have to say that the present cold storage building with some alterations can be used and our instructor with the older boys may do the greatest part of the work.\n\nWe thought at first that we could secure at our saw mills dry shavings for the insulation, but after inquiries, we found that the shavings from the surrounding mills are not perfectly dry. So we will have to use quilts instead. Also two doors and frames will have to be made in Vancouver in order to give sure satisfaction. This of course will again increase the first figures of $1455-00 a little. The engine we have on hand has been used for some time and as a matter of prudence some parts will have to be renewed. We will have to buy about 3000 feet of lumber for the insulation walls that will cost approximately one hundred dollars.\n\nWill you kindly point out to the Department that amongst the various improvements needed around here, that is; silo, pigery, cow shed, installation of electricity in the outside buildings, completion of the building for the employees' quarters, refrigerator plant, this last one is the most necessary and the most urgent of all.\n\nWe would like the Department to return the sketch showing the dimensions of the proposed plant.\n\nYours truly,\n\nN. Coccolo, C.M.I.\nOttawa, April 14, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your S-2 of the 30th ultimo with enclosures, including a copy of a communication from the Rev. Principal, relative to a refrigerator plant at the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School. This scheme commends itself to the Department and I have to advise the Rev. Principal to proceed with it, on the understanding that when it is entirely complete and in satisfactory running order, if he presents receipted accounts for the activity, the Department will make a grant of $1600. All bills are to be paid by the Rev. Principal and receipts should be forwarded, in duplicate, for our attention. I am enclosing the sketch requested by Father Coccolo.\n\nPlease inform the Rev. Principal that he must not connect up this refrigerator plant in any way with the electric lighting system or generator, i.e., the power must be provided by gas engine. When the request is made for the Department's grant, the papers that I am returning should be redirected to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Peck, V.C., M.P., on the subject of erecting a building for the boarding school at Stuart Lake. The erection of a residential school for these Indians was promised them during a visit which they made to Ottawa in the year 1906. The Department of Fisheries had been having a great deal of trouble with them, on account of their methods of taking fish, and a promise and an arrangement was finally arrived at, and one of the items in the understanding or agreement was the provision of this residential school. In the first place we postponed it until the Grand Trunk Pacific should be completed, shortly after the war broke out, and we made that an excuse for a further postponement. Now Bishop Bunoz, the Roman Catholic Bishop of that diocese, is insistent that we should put up the school at once, and, by so doing, implement our promise to the Indians.\n\nColonel Peck is anxious to be able to send a favourable reply to the Bishop, who has communicated with him. I am in correspondence with the Indian Agent of the district on the subject of the proper location of the school, and the cost of materials, etc., and will submit a further report.\n\nI would beg to recall our conversation of a short time ago, when you decided to recommend provision of funds for four new residential schools, one each for the\nfour denominations interested in Indian education. The Roman Catholic school was to be erected on the Peigan reserve, Southern Alberta. In consideration of the definite promise that has been made, it might be held that we should erect the Stuart Lake school first, although the conditions at the Peigan reserve are almost insupportable. The building of a school in this remote district is sure to be a heavy expense, but the Bishop is now very urgent about it, and I think it would be as well if you were to allow me to include an item in the Estimates for this school as well as $20,000.00 or $30,000.00, with which we might make a start and put in the foundation this summer.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOffice of the Stuart Lake Indian Agency,\n\nMay 5th, 1927\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 2132, amounting to $176-20 in favour of Rev. N. Coccolo, O.M.I., Lejac, B.C. (Removal of Eave troughs) for Fraser Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 163-1-5 dated Feb. 9th, 1927.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPrince Rupert, B.C. May 31st, 1919\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott, Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI would be very thankful if you would let me know at your earliest convenience whether work will be started on the Fraser Lake school this Summer as I would to take account of this in my programme of visitation in that section of my diocese.\n\nI must state that I was amazingly surprised to hear that through political pull another school had been placed on the estimates in preference to Fraser Lake school. After all the promises I had that the Fraser Lake school would be the first built after Kuper Island I would never have expected such a treatment; besides the fact, the undeniable fact (and I know British Columbia) that there is no other school so necessary for the good of the Indians and so strictly due to them by the Government of Canada as the school of Fraser Lake which has been put off for the last nine years and which may have to make room now for another which is almost like a palace compared to Stuart's Lake.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Kindly furnish the particulars for which request was made on the 31st May, and, if a refund is due the Department, the money should be forwarded.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H.

File No. 163-1-5 relative to an error in the pay lists which I submitted under date of the 23rd. of May. It seems that the Rev. Principal only sent one copy of the pay list and it was forwarded to the Department so that I am not able to check up on the matter here until I get the list in question.\n\nWould you kindly return the time sheets and I will check them over to find out where the error is.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa 31st May, 1927\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 23rd instant, with enclosures regarding work performed at the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School, I beg to say that according to the pay-lists the number of hours worked by Mr G. Venanzio was 145 3/8, and by Mr Z. Martin 120 hours. If the men worked 8 hours per day for 6 days of the week, but if they only worked 4 hours on Saturday Mr Venanzio's time would be 133 3/8 hours and Mr Martin's 112 hours. In the Voucher (No 2132) which has been paid 166 hours were charged for Mr Venanzio at 70 cents per hour and 150 hours were charged for in the case of Mr Martin, at 40 cents per hour.\n\nKindly furnish explanation in this matter and if an overpayment has been made, as would appear refund of the amount should be obtained and forwarded to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.H.

Principal did not complete them and it meant that a certain delay occurred before I got them in this office.\n\nI have received these time sheets from the Rev.

PRATT,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 4th instant, regarding construction work last year at the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School, I have to report that a new granary, a new root cellar and the completion of the carpenter and blacksmith shops were the only building activities undertaken by this Department. The materials were purchased, after competitive prices, by the Indian Agent, and the work was done on a day labour basis, under the supervision of the Rev. Principal. I understand a little expert labour was engaged.\n\nThe Rev. Principal, at the expense of the school management, erected three small outbuildings during the year, the total cost of which was approximately $750. The outbuildings referred to are a post office, a recreation room and an implement shed.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMay 4th, 1927\n\nDR.

May 21st 1900\n\nDuncan C Scott Esq\nDeputy Supt General\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt has come to my knowledge that the Indian Dept contemplate erecting a school at Stuart Lake. I respectfully make application for the position of Inspector of Construction.\n\nI trust my services in the past have given satisfaction to you and the Dept. As Inspector of Construction at Hope Island Industrial School and on the Building work in progress at Alberni it was and is my endeavor to get efficient work at the same time conscientiously guarding the interests of the Dept without fear or favour.\n\nThis School will be completed about August. I trust my application will receive favourable consideration, as I should like to continue my services with the Indian Dept.\n\nI remain\nYour obedient servant,\nMyles Morley\nInspector of Construction\nJune 2, 1920.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Mr. Neighen,\n\nI beg to report that it was owing to your direction that tenders were asked for the erection of a boarding school building for the Indians of Stuart Lake, in the Babine agency, B.C.\n\nI attach hereto a report from the Architect on the tenders received. The lowest is that of R. Moncrieff, of Vancouver.\n\nThe Architect makes the recommendation that the building should be finished in brick veneer, which would make the cost $174,400.00. Our estimated cost of the building was $175,000.00.\n\nIn submitting this matter for your consideration, I would make the following remarks:\n\nThis school was promised to the Indians in 1906; on their agreeing to do away with aboriginal methods of fishing which had brought them into collision with the fisheries overseers. The erection of the building was postponed from time to time for two main reasons: first, it was decided to wait until the Grand Trunk Pacific was built, and second, to wait until the war was over. The obstacle which now may be considered to lie in the way of the fulfilment of the promise is the excessive cost at the present time.\n\nThe proposed building is shorn of all luxuries and is completely economical. All that is provided in the Estimates is $80,000, and the vote will not bear any additional charge for this building. It will, therefore, be necessary to\nhave a supplementary appropriation of $95,000.00.\n\nAs it would be a disappointment to the ecclesiastical authorities who have been conducting the school for some years in temporary quarters if the work is not gone on with, I would ask for your best consideration. I may suggest that perhaps under all the circumstances, the best plan would be to submit the tenders with a full memorandum to His Excellency in Council, recommending the acceptance of the tender and the provision of the necessary amount.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMay 28, 1920.\n\nDear Colonel Griesbach,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of May 22, with reference to Mr. H. G. McDonald & Company, Contractors, Edmonton, who intend to submit a tender in connection with the contract for building the Stuart Lake Indian school.\n\nIn reply I have to say that I have noted your remarks on their behalf.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent-General.\n\nLt.-Col.

They have not yet passed, although I believe the Minister has approved of the item for the construction of the school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nLt. Col. C.W. Peck, V.C., M.P.,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nHon. Mr. Neishen -\n\nStuart Lake Roman Catholic Boarding school building.\n\nPlans and specifications for the above building are now ready and I have a telegram from Col. Peck, M.P., asking whether we have advertised for tenders. Col. Peck is very much interested in the erection of this school and he and Bishop Tunoz expect that we will advertise for tenders immediately. Before doing so I wish to say that we have prepared plans for a building to accommodate 150 pupils. Due economy has been shown and the construction is in no way extravagant or beyond our needs for that number of pupils.\n\nThis school is to be erected on an Indian reserve on the south side of Fraser Lake, midway between the stations of Fraser Lake and Encomb, B.C. Our architect estimates the cost of the building as it stands at not less than $149,000.00. In my memorandum on the estimates, submitted on the request of Sir Henry Drayton that we should cut them down, I mentioned that we had simply asked for the same amount as last year and of this amount I had allotted $80,000.00 for the building at Stuart Lake. I do not think it proper even to advertise without letting you know the situation. If we advertise and find that our estimate is correct we will have to decide to provide for the difference before letting the contract.\n\nIf you think well I will ask for tenders and upon their receipt you can give the matter further consideration and come to a decision.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nTelegram.\n\nPrince Rupert, B.C., Feb. 2.

The cylinders being cast separately are securely and accurately bolted to the compressor base, therefore can be easily removed and replaced.\n\nCylinders\u2014To be water-jacketted, each cylinder to have a diameter of 3\u00bd inches and a stroke of 4 inches.\n\nSafety Heads\u2014Each cylinder to be supplied with a safety head so that in case any foreign matter, or a rush of liquid should enter the cylinders, the safety heads will lift, thereby preventing as far as possible any damage.\n\nValves (patents pending)\u2014Are so constructed that they can be readily withdrawn and examined by removing the cylinder covers. The valves are guaranteed to work mechanically silent.\n\nPistons\u2014To be supplied of our double trunk construction, accurately turned and fitted with metallic rings.\n\nConnecting Rods\u2014To be supplied of steel with anti-friction metal bearings. The construction to be such that both bearings can be easily adjusted after removing the compressor base cover.\n\nCrankshaft\u2014To be made of steel and to pass through a stuffing box on the compressor base.\n\nFlywheel\u2014To be supplied turned and faced suitable for belt drive and to be 24 inches in diameter by 4 inches face, and to weigh about 200 pounds.\n\nLubrication\u2014The compressor base is made hollow and filled with a special nonfreezing oil so that the main bearings and connecting rods are running in oil. The base cover is fitted with an oil gauge.\n\nOil Trap\u2014One to be supplied by us.\n\nScale Trap\u2014One to be supplied by us.\n\nRelief Valve\u2014One to be supplied of the automatic safety type to prevent damage in case of excessive pressure due to failure of water supply, etc.\n\nPacking\u2014Compressor gland to be provided with flexible, semi-metallic packing.\nAMMONIA CONDENSER\n\n(Double Pipe)\n\nTo be of our latest Double Pipe Type, and to consist of one section, each section to contain two double pipes about 12 feet long over all.\n\nConstruction\u2014The Construction of this double pipe condenser is that a 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch water pipe is placed inside of a special 2 inch lapwelded ammonia pipe. The water for condensing purposes passes upwards through the 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch pipe and the ammonia gas to be condensed passes downward between the outside surface of the 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch and the inside of the 2 inch pipes.

Moore  \nIndian Agent  \nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHerewith I submit the Quarterly Report ending Sept. 20, 1927.\n\nThe pupils enjoyed their holidays, though some of those who spent them at home are not so healthy looking as they were in leaving school, likely for want of proper food or regularity.\n\nAs usual we had to go around the camps to gather them, the generality of parents do not appreciate yet the advantage of education; they would rather keep their children with them.\n\nThe refrigeration plant has proved satisfactory during the exceptionally hot summer.\n\nWe purchased a truck to haul freight from the station so necessary when north trains bring perishable goods. A garage for same was also erected.\n\nAt present the electric light is extended to the barn and outside buildings.\n\nHaving to break new ground we have ordered a tractor with necessary attachments for the purpose, besides it will give our boys a general knowledge of farm implements.\n\nThe crops are better than we expected, having had no rain to speak of all this summer. For same cause the potatoes are rather small.\n\nIt will take a few weeks more for the pupils to settle down and give entire satisfaction.\n\nHoping that you will appreciate the efforts made to improve the coming generation in your Agency\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. N. Coccolia O.M.I.\n\nPrincipal\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, October 22nd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, informing the Department that there are about 19 school desks at the old Mission school at Fort St. James, the property of the Department, and recommending that they either be transferred to the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School, where they could be utilized, or sold.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if these desks can be used at the Fraser Lake School, you may arrange to have them transferred to that school. The Department would pay the cost of cartage, which it is hoped will be kept as reasonable as possible, and you may forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the transportation after the work has been completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAas't. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nOctober 15th 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been informed that there are about 19 School desks still left at the Old Mission School at Fort St. James the property of the Department and as the building that these desks are in is not quite weather proof I felt that the Department should be notified so that if the Department wishes the desks in question could either be sold to the local schools or shipped direct to the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School where I understand they could be used. If the Department decides on the latter course I would be pleased to receive the necessary authority to move the desks right away before they go through another Winter in a building that is not rain proof. If this authority is granted I would respectfully request that cartage charges on the desks be allowed as the move is about 100 miles by road and would have to be done by motor truck and the sum of thirty-five or forty dollars would be necessary to cover the dray man's charges.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nRHM/L.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nAugust 30th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th inst. File No. 163-1-5 and am returning herewith cheque No. 2137 for $176-20 as requested.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nRHM/L.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSIR,\n\nInclosed you will find an official cheque of this Department in payment of the account or service shown upon its face. It should be presented at the Bank for payment as soon as it is received by the person in whose favour it is drawn. If any correspondence becomes necessary with reference to this payment, kindly refer to the number, amount and date of the cheque, and address your communication to \"The Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Construction will be on a day labour basis, under the supervision of Mr. T. P. Smithers, of Vanderhoof. The materials will be purchased by yourself, after consultation with Mr. Smithers.\n\nIf a more expensive building is desired by the Rev. Principal, the school management will have to pay the balance of the cost. The expense can be kept at a minimum if the older boys and the manual instructor at the school are employed in the work, without cost to the Department other than the regular salary of the instructor. Labour returns, in duplicate, should be forwarded, showing the receipts of the men engaged. An accountable cheque for this purpose will be directed to you upon application.

You will please remember that Mr. Smithers was in charge of the work done last year at the School and he proved very satisfactory, hence my recommendation that he be employed again this year.

That a new root cellar be provided.\n2. Fire extinguishers refilled and the boys trained in their use.\n3. Stove pipes from the jacket heater, which are in a dangerous condition, having eight bends from the heater to the exit, should be made safer and given better draft.\n4.

The older boys should receive instruction in their use, and fire drills should be given the pupils.\n\nPlease report regarding the other recommendations of the Inspector, giving an estimate of the cost of any work you would recommend be carried out. Full particulars should be given regarding the root cellar and the replacing of the present steam boiler in the laundry by a larger boiler.\n\nThe school authorities should change the present location of the jacket heater and adjust the stove pipes therefrom in order that there will be no danger from fire.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to hear from you regarding the matters referred to at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nINSPECTION REPORT ON STUART LAKE AGENCY (NO.7) AUG 26, 1929.\n\nI visited and went over Le Jac Residential school at Fraser Lake. Holidays were on but I met the Principal, Rev. Father Cocoola. The crops were excellent. I also saw the new pig pens. The barn was also in first class condition and I saw the new pedigree bull. A new root cellar is badly needed. The Manual training shop is working well and some very good work is being turned out by the boys. I also went over the main building with Mr. Moore and the Principal. The Fire extinguishers want refilling and the boys trained in their use. Mr. Moore is going to test their fire drill when school reopens. The stove pipes from the Jacket heater are dangerous. It is too far to its exit, and takes too many bends, about eight. This can be rectified at little cost, made safer, and with better draft. The heater is also too close to the gasoline engines to be safe. The steam boiler in the laundry is now too small for the work required. It cannot supply enough steam for the washing machines, and drying machines in the laundry, especially in winter. It should be replaced by a larger boiler.\n\nC. S. PRAGNELL.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, September 11th, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your S-2 of the 31st ultimo, with reference to the proposed hog pen at the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School. In view of your representations, the Department approves of the plan submitted by the Reverend Principal, which is returned herewith. $1,500 will be allowed towards this improvement and, when you are arranging for the work, please be guided by the instructions in my letter of the 14th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nSir:\n\nIn acknowledging receipt of your letter of the 14th inst., File No. 163-1-5 relative to the erection of a hog pen at the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School, I hereby state that I forwarded a copy of your letter to the Principal so that he would understand and give the views of the Department in the matter.\n\nIn reply to this I received a letter from the Principal, copy of which I attach hereto along with the Blueprint of the proposed Piggery, and you will see from these that the amount allowed by the Department is just about half enough, however, I must say that I feel very much the same way about the Building as the Reverend Principal does and would prefer to see a Piggery built that would be in keeping with the other buildings already on the ground. Furthermore, material is much more expensive here than in more accessible places owing to the high freight rates which prevail along this line of Railway, and should we erect an $800.00 building it would not begin to accommodate the number of pigs that are usually kept at the School and for your information I would respectfully point out that there are on an average of four brood sows with their litters always on hand as well as a Boar and some ready for killing. However, I am also enclosing the blueprint sent by the Principal and I think you will agree with me that the proposed building is not only substantial but will also be a credit to the School and to the Department.\n\nPlease do not misunderstand my action in again bringing this question before the Department, but I feel that I would not be doing the right thing to the Department were I to commence building before laying all the facts before you. Consequently, I would respectfully suggest that you please take this matter into consideration again, going over the plans carefully and if possible raise the appropriation by as much again. I fully understand the difficulties that you have to contend with insofar as finding funds to cover all these different improvements, but in case funds are not available this year could the Principal advance an equal amount with the Department on the understanding that he would be reimbursed after April 1st, 1930. If so I am sure that he would be willing to go ahead. In closing please allow me to again thank the Department for the many kindnesses and considerations allowed me on behalf of this Agency on previous occasions and it is knowing the consideration you have always given my recommendations before that make me hesitate before asking you to again consider this question. Trusting to hear from you favourably in this regard at your early convenience.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir:\nYour obedient servant;\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S.

In this connection I wish to point out that I made a regular visit to the School last week and took the different items mentioned in your letter, up with the Principal and we arrived at an understanding on each of them, the result of which I would respectfully submit here-with for your consideration.\n\n(1): New root cellar can wait until next year.\n\n(2): Fire extinguisher refills have been ordered by the Rev. Principal and instruction and fire drill are given the children once a week.\n\n(3): The location of the Jacket heater should be moved outside entirely where there is an ideal place for it in an alcove between the main building and the chapel, owing to the fact that I have not got a plan of the school where the alcove in question is shown I am unable to explain its exact location so that you would fully understand but it is a good location and should prove satisfactory, all it needs is a small room built in brick and roofed which will cost approximately $450.00. There is no other place where the heater can be changed to without having just as much stove pipe and alcoves as there are at present owing to the distance away from the chimney.\n\nThe steam boiler in the laundry is much too small and we got a price on one that is large enough from the Fairbanks-Morse Co. amounting to $555.00 plus $150.00 for freight charges and pipe connections and fittings. It can be installed by the engineer without any cost to the Department and if the Department would kindly take this matter into consideration at an early date and advise what action you wish me to take, I would greatly appreciate it as it is getting late in the year and the work should be done as quickly as possible.\n\nI would also respectfully suggest that arrangements be made at an early date to provide Fire Gongs for the school, the one in use at the present time is much too small and cannot be heard all through the building. I would recommend that four be purchased, one for each floor, and connected up in such a way that they can be rung from any floor and will ring at once on all the floors. These gongs should be a reasonable size so that they will be heard above any other noises that may be happening. I did not get a price on the gongs but no doubt you could get an approximate cost from one of the stores in Ottawa.\n\nTrusting that the several points mentioned in your letter are fully covered so that you will understand them, and that I will hear further in the near future.\n\nYours obedient servant;\n\nThe Secretary:\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am noting for next year's Estimates the advisability of providing a root cellar and changing the location of the Jacket Heater. There is, however, an urgent need in the laundry. The boiler is too small, and the school management offers to make the installation if the Department will purchase a larger one, at a cost of $535, plus approximately $150 freight charges. There should also be approximately $100 expended on the fire gong system, and, as funds can be found now, I wish to recommend these improvements to your favourable consideration.\n\nRussell A. Sevier\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, November 2, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your S-2 of the 21st ultimo, with reference to improvements at the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School. The advisability of providing a new root cellar next year has been noted for estimates. I have also placed an item in the estimates for a new space for the jacket heater.\n\nYou may purchase a new steam boiler for the laundry, at a cost of $535, plus approximately $150 for freight charges and connections.

That saved the expense of hiring Mr. T.P. Smithers by day labour and made it possible to have the building completed this year. The only outlay for labour was for digging the water mains and sewer trench which amounted to $177.00 and which was paid for by the Reverend Principal at the time and which amount he is asking to have repaid as per attached Voucher. All the material in the building, with the exception of some small items, amounted to $159.15 for which Vouchers have gone forward and which leaves a balance of $140.85. The Voucher attached for $177.00 will overdraw the amount allowed but I am sending it in and should you not be able to meet the few dollars extra kindly deduct from the amount of the Voucher, but to show you that we did the best we could under the circumstances to keep the expense within the amount allowed and still build a structure that will be in keeping with the other buildings, I am also attaching a letter from the Rev. Principal which is self explanatory.\n\nYour obedient servant;\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nResidential School, Lejac, B.C., Jan. 3d, 1930\n\nR.H.

The total cost of material and the digging of trenches for foundations and water pipes amount to $1,685.40. The work on the building was done by our men and the boys under the direction of the manual training Instructor.\n\nHere are the details:\n- Lumber from Fraser Lake Sawmills Co.: $357.37\n- Cement from A.P. Andersen: $273.40\n- Nails from A.H. Ashdown: $17.01\n\nTotal: $647.78\n\nThis amount was paid direct by the Department.\n\nHog pen equipment from Alberta dairy supplies, &c.\n\nDigging trenches for foundations &c.: $264.50\n\nTotal: $912.28\n\nThis amount I paid myself waiting for the Department to refund kindly find bills receipted.\n\nThe accessories for which I am not sending bills having been paid by our savings from the capita grants:\n- Pipes galvanized: $52.68\n- Extra lumber and shingles: $73.10\n- 12 Windows: $43.44\n- Paints: $12.52\n\nTotal: $181.78\n\nEnclosed find the bill of the Instructor.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Coccolo, O.M.I., I would respectfully refer you to your letter of May 21st, last in which you authorised the sum of $450.00 for this work. Upon receipt of your letter I wrote the Principal acquainting him with the contents, and under date of May 29th, I received a letter from him in which he stated that owing to other work of an important nature that he was not quite ready to proceed, but when convenient he would get prices on the materials etc. and let me know. This happened last May and as nothing had been done about it, so far as I knew, on the 5th, of the present month, I wrote the Principal again pointing out that I had not been advised of what he proposed doing or the prices obtained, and suggesting immediate action be taken so that the work would be completed before the cold weather. I received a reply to that letter, from the Principal in which he stated \"that the surest way to find out the cost was to go ahead and build it, this work has been done and in the near future he would send on bills for labour and material which he had already paid.\" In due course these arrived and as I thought the carpenter work should have been done by the Manual Training Instructor at the School I wrote the Principal and asked for an explanation why this was not done to which he replied under date of the 25th, inst., copy of which is also attached. I trust that the above explanation will be satisfactory and that a cheque in favour of the Rev. Principal will be sent him in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOffice of the Stuart Lake Indian Agency,\n\nSeptember 18th, 1930\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 4352, amounting to $483.62 in favour of Rev.

Our Manual Instructor was supervising the work and working at the same time to complete the installation of the Jacket in the shortest time as hot water was always needed. That is what made the cost of the improvement to amount to the enclosed figure.\n\nThe help of a competent Plumber was also required to make a safe and sanitary job.\n\nHoping that these explanations will make matters clear.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned:\n\nN.

W. Irwin, ........ Fort Fraser, B.C.\nRichards and Black, ...... Vanderhoof, \"\n\nActing D. S. G. I. A.\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nJune 22nd, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I have this day received a letter from the Rev. Principal of the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School, which says in part:\n\n\"I have to bring to the attention of the Department that our lighting battery is in bad condition and should be rebuilt as soon as possible. I would suggest that the necessary material be supplied and the work done during the vacation period by our Engineer. We have obtained competitive prices from two firms in Vancouver and the cost of material will be about $500.00. If repairs are delayed it may become necessary to renew the battery.\"\n\nFor the information of the Department I wish to point out that the set of batteries in question was installed at the School in June 1926, and from information I got, I understand that the average life of a set of batteries, such as we have at the School, lasts about six years. The batteries cost $1145.00 at the School siding so that to have them rebuilt will cost almost half of the original cost. If the price of batteries has gone down anything worth while we might be able to get a new set for very little more than it would take to rebuild the old set. However, I can not get that information here without sending out for it, but you might be able to get it in Ottawa, so if you would kindly take the matter into consideration at your early convenience and advise if we may incur the necessary expenditure this year. I might add that when the estimates were made last summer this battery was in good shape, but they go in a hurry once they start.\n\nYour obedient servant:\n\nR.H.

I regret, therefore, that the Department will be unable to provide, this year, the expenditure required in the erection of the root cellar.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

C.\nMay 26th, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to attach hereto a letter received from the Reverend Principal of the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School, which is self explanatory.\n\nIn this connection I would respectfully refer you to your letter of May 21st, 1930, File No. 163-1-5 in which you advised that no funds were available for this work last year, or in other words in the estimates of 1930-31. However, I included this amount again in the estimates for 1931-32 which went forward from this Office to Mr Commissioner Ditchburn under date of July 12th, last.\n\nIn the above connection I would like to add to the representations made by the Rev. Principal, that the Cellar is a necessity, and I sincerely hope that the Department may be able to see its way clear to have this amount available for the construction of the Cellar this year.\n\nTrusting to have a favourable reply in this connection, so that I may be able to inform the Principal, I might add that the work should be done during the holidays, or at least a start made on it so that it could be completed before the vegetables are taken out of the ground this Fall.\n\nYour obedient servant;\n\nR.H.

The present cellar, too small, built ten years ago is caving in, repairs were made at different times but now is threatening a complete ruin and dangerous for anyone going in.\n\nWe need a larger cellar than the old one, in proportion of the development of farm and garden and the number of pupils at the present time.\n\nTo be lasting and convenient the cellar should be in concrete at the cost of about $2000.00.\n\nHoping that the Department will come to our help.\n\nYours truly;\n\nSigned: N.

Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nOttawa, December 3, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for the Province of British Columbia, in a report on his recent inspection of the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School, recommends that 100 yards of half inch wire cable for the hay fork in the hay barn be supplied. He states that the present rope breaks constantly and is a danger to the children working with the hay, and that this cable would cost approximately $50. You may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the above quantity of wire cable.\n\nMr. Barry also states that one new set of drills for mending farm machinery and one complete set of taps and dies are required for the use of the blacksmith shop, and that the drills would cost approximately $10 and the taps and dies about $15. You may arrange for the purchase and delivery of these tools.\n\nHe recommends that a guard rail be placed around the extractor in the laundry to protect the pupils from walking or backing into the moving parts of the machinery. He states that he discussed this matter with the engineer and that the guard rail may be installed before this date, as the necessary materials were available at the school and the engineer was quite able to do the work, which should be carried out without expense to the Department.\n\nYou should make the above authorized purchases from indicated sources of supply, obtaining accounts, in duplicate, which you should attached to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nA cement cellar is required for the storage of fruit and vegetables. The old one is not much further use as it has fallen in. A cellar big enough to store carload lots of fruit and vegetables is required. I understand from the Principal that such a cellar will cost between $2000 and $3000 to construct. I wish to recommend that a large enough cellar be authorized; but I do not know just how correct the Principal is in his estimate of the cost. It is, of course, essential that in this cold part of B.C. some satisfactory method of storage of roots, etc., be authorized.\n\nThe Pig Pen has a concrete and rail interior. It has been well built. I have been asked to recommend that tiles be supplied to construct a drain from the Pig Pen to the top of a hill, from which there is a large natural fall in the ground, which would drain off all water. The length of such a tile drain would be about 100 yards. I think that a wooden box drain would be satisfactory here. The important thing is to have it deep and well covered, so that the water in it will not freeze in the winter. This would probably be much less expensive than a tile drain. Some sort of well protected drain is necessary as the water freezes and will not run off. More and more collects in the Pig Pen and this too freezes.\n\nI wish to recommend the supply of 100 yards of half inch wire cable for the hay fork on the Hay Barn. The present rope breaks constantly and is a danger to the children working with the hay. The cable now recommended would cost about $50.00.\n\nIn the Blacksmith's Shop the following are required and their supply is recommended:- One new set Drills for mending farm machinery (one sixteenth inch to one inch are required). This set of drills will cost about $10.00. - One complete set of Taps and Dies are also very badly needed, as the old ones are now completely worn out and quite useless. This set will cost about $15.00.\n\nLaundry:- I wish to recommend that a guard rail be placed around the extractor. This will keep a child from walking or backing into the moving parts of the machinery and is, I think, very necessary. The engineer will probably have done this work by now, as we had a talk about its necessity when I was at the school. The materials are available at the school and he is quite able to do the necessary work of installing such a guard rail.\nOttawa, November 16, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, regarding the repairs required to the drain from the piggery at the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School. In this connection it is noted that you authorized the Principal to dig a drain to a depth below frost level and to supply the necessary lumber, nails, etc.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the action taken by you in having this drain placed in a suitable condition is approved. I would request, however, that, in future, before authorizing any expenditure which the Department will be called upon to provide, you first report the matter and receive the necessary authority, except in case of an emergency, when you should report your action, giving full particulars as to the nature of the work authorized and the cost involved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof,\nB. C.\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nNovember 6th, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI would respectfully refer you to previous correspondence in connection with the new pigery that was built at the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School about two years ago. At the time no provision was made for a drain to take off the water from the building except for a short distance below it, which answered the purpose for a time but this fall the water is starting to run over the grounds and to insure against disease among the children, I made arrangements with the Rev. Principal to go ahead and dig a drain from the Pigery to a point about 100 yards below which is well out of reach of the School yard and buildings. This drain I arranged to be deep enough so that it would not freeze and would consist of a box drain set at the bottom of the ditch that is now almost dug. All it would cost would be the price of the lumber and nails. We require approximately three thousand feet of 2\" rough lumber and one keg of nails. The lumber sells for about $30-00 per thousand and the nails at about $8-00 per keg. $100-00 would cover the job and as it is most important to get the drainage away from the play grounds and buildings, I took it upon myself to order the material so that the work could be completed before the ground freezes. Kindly give me the necessary authority for this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nSeptember 10th, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge with thanks receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, file No. not given, authorising necessary repairs to be made to the Lighting Plant at the Fraser Lake Indian Residential School, and that prices for same be obtained from Richards & Black of Vanderhoof and E.W. Irwin of Fort Fraser. In this connection, I wish to attach hereto certain correspondence given me by the Rev. Principal which explains the matter insofar as he is concerned, and I am taking the liberty to attach hereto voucher No.5291 for the sum of $395.36 in favour of Rev. N. Coccolo.\n\nInsofar as getting prices from the firms above mentioned, I would just like to say that they are small garage owners and if asked to quote on a job of this kind they would have to order the materials from the wholesaler, or the manufacturer as the case might be, have them shipped to Ladac direct where they would be taken over by the Engineer at the School and the necessary repairs made. This is just what the Rev. Principal did, in fact he ordered, as you will see by the letter, from the Manufacturer at exactly the same price that the Garage men could get, (in fact a little better as they usually order from the wholesaler and would have to pay his profit) with the exception that no profit had to be paid as would have been the case had the order gone through the local garage, for its only natural that they would expect some profit should it only be 10%. The point I wish to make is, this work was done before your letter of authority arrived as the Principal had to assure himself of light for the School before the end of the holidays, hence his hurry in having the work attended to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary:\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Principal on the subject.\n\nApparently when the present plant was first installed, it was just large enough to carry the load of the School alone, since then the load has been increased every year with new lines being run to the outbuildings etc., so that now the plant is most unsatisfactory. About a year and a half ago, we had the present batteries rebuilt after five years service, thinking that we would save the cost of a new set, as the cost of rebuilding was only a fraction of the cost of a new set. However, the batteries after about a year's running (after being rebuilt) commenced to go down again and would not hold a charge at all, until now the plant has to be run almost day and night to keep them even half charged. This is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs and the light is getting worse and worse. I send a copy of the Rev. Principal's letter now to you and would suggest that if at all possible that arrangements be made this fall to install a new plant large enough to carry the required load, or else buy a new set of batteries. The drawback about installing new batteries is that, the present generator is too small, so that we would only have the same thing to contend with again in the near future. I would respectfully urge that early action be taken in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant;\n\nThe Secretary;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAllow me to bring to your attention to the unsatisfactory lighting condition in our school, remarked by Inspector Barry in his inspection last October.\n\nThe battery is worn out, the present engine 10 H.P. Z type by Fairbanks-Morse has been obsolete for 10 years and the 5 K W Generator is too small to charge a battery rated at 240 Ampere hours.\n\nThe cost of a new battery is almost equal to the cost of a Diesel direct connection lighting plant, which a firm is prepared to install in the School for the sum of $2875-00, sales tax extra.\n\nBy use of a Diesel Lister Lighting Plant we would need no Battery which cost $2200-00 delivered, we would have better light and save an outlay of about $400-00 per year in battery maintenance and fuel, in fact this is a low estimate of the probable reduction of operation cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned: H. Coccolo, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nKamloops, B.C., June 15th, 1932.\n\nINSPECTION REPORT STUART LAKE AGENCY No. 10.\n\nI visited LeJac Indian Residential School. There were 163 children there at the date of my visit. I found everything neat and clean and went over the whole school. Fire equipment was in good order and the chemical extinguishers had been properly refilled. The children were having fish, soup, potatoes and bread for dinner, and were getting plenty of milk to drink. The shingle roof of the building should be painted. The Rev. Principal contends that the summer holidays should officially be made two months and Mr. Moore is inclined to agree with him. Apparently, owing largely to long distances travelled to their homes, and the fact that having in the agency takes place late, it is almost impossible to get the children back at the prescribed time.\n\nG.S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, March 4, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your report for the month of February, last, on the Lejac Indian Residential School, with reference to the fire escapes, I have to say it is noted that these escapes become covered with ice, caused by the snow melting on the roof of the building, and that you recommend a wooden roof be built over the escapes all the way down.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department is not prepared to incur the expenditure required in supplying materials to build a roof over the fire escapes. The school authorities should have a member of the staff or some of the older boys keep the ice removed from these fire escapes each day. If this was carried out from day to day, or as occasion demanded it, the condition referred to by you would be overcome.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nEXTRACT from Indian Agent Moore's Report for the month of February, 1932, regarding the LETAC INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 163-1-7.\n\nSuggestions:- That more attention be paid to the farm in connection with the school; this could be done by appointing a Farm Manager, who would be capable of lecturing to the pupils in the class room, as well as attending to the general Farm work.\n\nWith reference to the fire escapes at the school, I might say that there is no covering of any kind over them and during this season of the year they get covered in ice caused by the snow on the roof of the building melting during the day, freezing in the evening and during the night, the result being that oftentimes the steps are very slippery and there is usually some difficulty in getting the pulleys to work that are on the bottom of the escape and that lifts up off the ground. This is the first year that we ever had any difficulty in this regard and so far as I can see the only way to overcome it would be to have a wooden roof built over the escape all the way down. No doubt the Department have had the same conditions existing at some of the other schools and were able to make certain improvements, which could be done in this case too. I could not give you an estimate of what the work would cost, but I would suggest that if the Department decide to go ahead with the work that I be allowed to take a carpenter to the school and get him to give me an estimate on what work would cost. On second thought, I could use the Manual Training Instructor who should be able to give me a close estimate on what the work would cost, at least the cost of the material, the work could be done by him and some of the older boys.\nLejac Residential School, B.C.\n\nFeb. 15, 1932\n\nSir;\n\nReferring to your circular to principals of Indian Residential Schools dated Feb. 5 No. I-I-5, we note all what it is said about danger of fire.\n\nOur fire escapes are kept in repair, freshly painted. Snow is removed after every storm, but it is not so easy to keep them free from ice, the droppings from the eaves and hanging ice from the roof interfere with the blocks to which the fire escapes are attached. What we will have to do is to prevent that trouble.\n\nFire drill is practised according to the weather, the fire extinguishers are kept at the strategic places, some of them have been refilled last year.\n\nThe night watchman makes the regular rounds, we are all interested in preventing accidents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

There will also be required some changes and additions in the switch board for the operating of the 3 K.W. generator in addition to the one that is already installed. Before authorizing the work, however, I would ask you to kindly obtain and forward to the Department prices for this installation from Mr. B. W. Irwin, of Fort Frances, B.C., and Richards and Black, Vanderhoof.\n\nI would ask you to also kindly furnish me with a list of the maximum number of lights that are in operation at one time, also any other electrical appliances that are being used in the school, such as heaters, motors, etc. When this information is received you will be further advised.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

There are, however, 275 light sockets and there are not any other electrical appliances being used.\n\nI am attaching a copy of a letter sent to the Rev. Principal by Mr. Allen, the Engineer at the School, which is self explanatory and which may throw some further information on the matter. Please advise further in this connection what your wishes are.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRHM/L.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nenclos. (1).\nResidential School,\nLejac, B.C.\nNov. 9th. 1932.\n\nRev. Father Coccolo, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nLejac, B.C.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to letter No. 163-1-5, referring to lights at this school, I would say that the plan referred to is not practical. We could not operate a 5 K.W. generator in addition to our 5 K.W. generator, as our 10 H.P. engine has not power to run them. In its present condition the engine is fully loaded running a 5 K.W. generator.\n\nThe engine is a 10 H.P., R.Z. type by Fairbanks Morse, the type has been obsolete for 6 years. The number of lights in use is kept down to the smallest number and will average about 90 lights of 40 watt capacity. The load including loss in lines shows 35 Amps at 110 volts on the switchboard.\n\nIt would be possible to get over our present difficulty by installing a battery of 160 Amp hour capacity, without the 5 K.W. generator but with the addition of a new switchboard to control charging, this would however be a very temporary arrangement, as we are 600 miles from a reliable source of repair parts (Vancouver and Edmonton) train and mail service will not allow of any orders being filled in less than 10 days. A battery of 160 hour capacity would run out in 3 days and would be dead in 10 days, that is, after standing 7 days after being exhausted. The fact that we have carried on for 11 years without mishap is no guarantee, but only shows we are nearing the time when accidents can be expected.\n\nI cannot recommend dealing with Fort Fraser or Vanderhoof people in this matter as they are not in a position to render service.\n\nI would respectfully urge that our application for Lister equipment be given careful consideration. These plants are as near fool proof as they can be made, and are used all over the world, often being successfully operated by Peons and natives.\n\nThe first cost of the Lister plant is low. The elimination of a battery is good economy. The cost of operation is very low, and the system of using 2 small units of different size will give 3 load variations.\n\nThis is good practice.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nSigned:- Harold Allen, Engineer in charge.\nOttawa, December 10, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication from the engineer in charge, relative to the lighting system at the Lejac Indian Residential School. In this connection it is noted that you were unable to obtain prices from the firms from which you were requested to obtain quotations for the installation of a generator and battery.\n\nThe Department has no funds available this year to provide the cost of installing Lister equipment. It is hoped, therefore, that the present lighting system can be kept in a condition which will be satisfactory during the balance of the present school year. An amount will be included in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year to cover the cost of new lighting equipment, but no definite assurance can be given as to whether the item will be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Burghy,\n\nSince writing my memorandum of the 2nd of May with reference to the installation of an electric lighting plant at the Lejac Indian Residential School, at Fraser Lake, B.C., I have received a letter from the Indian Agent in which he states that the Principal is prepared to pay $1,500.00 towards the cost of the lighting plant, the total cost of which will be $3,500.00.\n\nThe Principal wishes to install a Lister automatic plant, and has obtained a price from the John Redden Company of Vancouver, the representatives of the Lister Company. The above mentioned figure is their quotation completely installed and tested at the school. I would recommend for your consideration that the installation of this plant be authorized.\n\nThis plant is entirely British made, and $3,000.00 is provided in this year's vote for Indian Education for this work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir:\n\nI thank you for your letter of the 12th., inst., File No. 163-1-5 regarding the installation of a new lighting plant at the Lejac Indian Residential School as well as need for a new bake oven and painting of the roofs of the School Buildings.\n\nWith reference to the lighting plant, I beg to attach hereto correspondence received this morning from the Rev. Principal which is self explanatory. After perusal please return the letters to me. I would also ask that you write me in this connection after reading the Principal's letter.\n\nRegarding your remarks about the bake oven and the repainting of the roofs, I wish to say that your instructions in this regard will be communicated to the Rev. Principal, but as the Rev. Principal is willing to stand the sum of $1500-00 for the lighting plant I thought that I would wait until I heard from you as to whether or not this offer of the Principal's would make a difference in so far as your decision goes about incurring the expense of the oven and the repainting of the roofs.

Would you please give me the names of additional firms from whom prices may be obtained.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, April 12, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, regarding the providing of new lighting equipment at the Lejac Indian Residential School and also the need of a new bake oven and the repainting of the roofs of the school building.\n\nIn reply I have to say that there is an amount included in our Estimates for the current fiscal year for new lighting equipment; but, until the funds are provided by Parliament at its present session, the Department will be unable to authorize the purchase. However, the matter will be kept in mind and you will be advised at a later date.\n\nWith reference to the purchase of a bake oven and the providing of a quantity of shingle stain, oil, etc., for the repainting of the roofs, I have to say that we will have no funds available for these services this year. Our Appropriation has been very considerably reduced, and, unless the school authorities themselves can provide the funds to purchase the oven and the shingle stain, etc., required, these items will have to stand over for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof,\nB. C.\nSir:-\n\nI would respectfully direct your attention to your letter of December the 10th., 1932, File No. 165-1-5 relative to the lighting system at the Lejac Indian Residential School, and more particularly to the last sentence of your letter which says in part:- \"An item will be included in our estimates for the coming fiscal year to cover the cost of new lighting equipment, but no definite assurance can be given as to whether the amount will be allowed.\"\n\nIn the above connection I wish to point out that this expenditure is an urgent necessity and I sincerely hope that I will receive the necessary authority to purchase the new plant as outlined in the Rev. Principal's letter of January the 30th. last, copy of which was sent to the Department, at an approximate cost installed of $2875-00.\n\nI would also request authority to expend the sum of $450-00 for a new bake oven for the School which is also badly needed, and the sum of $225-00 which is the estimated cost of shingle stain, oil etc. for the repainting of the roofs of the School buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.

Jennings, B.C.P. Police and Myself on all patrols to the Fort St. James District for the discovery of the remaining (3) Frames. Cst. Jennings reports that whilst on Provincial Police investigations, North of Ft. St. James, he made a close check of the windows in the cabin where the missing Frames were asserted to be by Father Allard, and although these Frames were similar, the search proved futile.\n\nDuring visits to Indian Houses at Neoselie Indian Reserve and the surrounding district the people assured me that the Complainant was exceptionally fortunate in having the (13) Frames restored, as all of these would have long since been destroyed by stones from the Indian Children, had not Leon Prince acted as Caretaker to safeguard this, for which he did not receive any payment.\n\nLeon Prince was emphatic in stating that the remaining (3) Frames had been destroyed several years ago otherwise they would have been returned by Indians who were assisting in the recovery to the fullest extent. In view of these circumstances, also that Father Allard, the Complainant and only witness who could identify the missing Frames has been transferred to the Arctic Regions, I would respectfully request that this Case be concluded, as it is impossible to prove any charge of Theft in this connection.\n\nThe Commissioner,\nR.C.M.P., Ottawa.\n\nL.F.

Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 16, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received the report of the Engineer of the Public Works Department on his inspection of the boilers and machinery at the Lejac Indian Residential School. He recommends that a solution of 1 lb. sal soda to 3 gallons of clear lime water be used, using one gallon of the solution every three weeks and blowing two inches of water from the boiler every week, in order to overcome the pitting of the tubes.\n\nWith reference to Boiler No. 22461, he stated that one of the tubes started to leak. This tube must be renewed or a bolt tube stopper be used for the next firing season. He recommends that 6 bolt tube stoppers be secured so that, if any tubes started to leak, repairs can be made in a few minutes by the staff, instead of shutting down the plant for perhaps weeks until new tubes can be obtained. The seat cover and water gauge should be overhauled and repacked. The main stop valve should be repacked and the fusible plug renewed.\n\nRegarding Boiler No. 44411, he states that several tubes were leaking at the top tube sheet. These should be re-expanded and will last a little longer. The internal condition of this boiler was very poor. It had the appearance of being badly used. He further states that the boilers at this school have been neglected but that better results are expected with the new engineer.\n\nConcerning the laundry equipment, he recommends that a new pipe guard be placed around the slit end of the washing machine. Materials for the purpose are at the school and the work can be done by the staff.\n\nFresh water Service. The Engineer reports as follows: \"The water supply is pumped from the lake. The pumps are connected together and have independent shutoff valves on the discharge line, but there are no relief valves between the shutoff on the discharge end the pumps. One should be installed, as these valves are closed and the pumps started, a serious breakdown of the pump might occur.\" At present,\n\n- the pump house\n\nR. H.

The Engineer states: \"The expansion mains have been allowed to get badly corroded and there is an ammonia leak in the Fresh Meat Room. These must be attended to, the mains cleaned off and painted with black Asphaltum.\"\n\nYou should draw to the attention of the Principal the report of the Engineer, regarding the boilers and equipment at this school. He should arrange to have the engineer at the school carry out the repairs and suggestions mentioned. Any cost must be met by the school authorities, from their per capita or other receipts. This Department has no funds available to pay any cost involved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nPublic Building,\nVictoria, B.C.,\nAugust 31st, 1933.\n\nC.F. Dawson, Esq.,\nDist. Res. Architect,\nDept. Public Works of Canada,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Inspection of Boilers and Machinery,\nIndian Residential School, Lejac, B.C.\n\nOn July 29th and 30th, 1933, I made an inspection of the mechanical plant of this school which consists of:\n\nTwo Horizontal return tubular boilers, 60 in. in diameter by 16 ft. long, containing 75 3\" x 16\" tubes, longitudinal joint, 3 rivetted lap. Nos. 22460 and 22461 B.C., rated at 104 H.P., each and built in 1923, making them ten (10) years old.\n\nOne Vertical tubular boiler, 28 in. in diameter by 67 in. high, containing 36 3\" x 36\" tubes, longitudinal joint, double rivetted lap. No. 44411 B.C., rated at 6.9 H.P. and built in 1929, making it now 4 years old.\n\nTwo 3-1/2\" x 6\" Duplex pumps belt driven by a 10 H.P. Fairbanks-Morse Z Type Gasoline Engine, used for fresh water supply.\n\nOne 2-1/2\" x 4\" Ammonia Gas Compressor, driven by a 3 H.P. Fairbanks-Morse Z Type Gasoline Engine.\n\nOne 6 H.P. Fairbanks-Morse Z Type Gasoline engine, operating the Laundry Machinery.\n\nOne 7 H.P. Gasoline Engine, operating the wood cutting plant.\n\nA new Lister cold starting Diesel lighting plant of one 5 K.P. Diesel Engine direct connected to a 2.5 K.W. Generator and one 9 H.P. Diesel Engine direct connected to a 4.5 Generator is being installed.\n\nBOILER NO. 22460.\n\nI gave this boiler a careful hammer test and found that all stays, rivets and plates in good condition. I then gave it a Hydrostatic Test of 40 lbs. per sq. in. and found it quite tight.\n\nThe internal condition of this boiler is very fair. There is some pitting started on the plates and tubes, which must be treated.\n\nThe test cocks, water gauge and blowdown cock are in good condition. The main stop valve is to be overhauled. The blowdown pipes are fair. The fusible plug is to be renewed. The steam gauge is 1 lb. light. The Safety Valve works freely and blows off at 5 lbs. pressure.\nBOILER NO. 22461 B.C.\n\nThis boiler is in a similar condition to No. 22460, but the pits are more pronounced. During the Hydrostatic Test, one of the tubes started to leak. An attempt to stop the leak with some patent preparation had been tried but without success. This tube must be renewed, or a bolt tube stopper be used for the next firing season. Owing to the very isolated position of this plant, I would recommend that 6 bolt tube stoppers be procured so that if any more tubes start to leak, repairs can be made in a few minutes by the Staff instead of shutting down the plant for perhaps weeks until new tubes arrive from the Coast. Owing to the pitting, leaky tubes must be expected until the pitting has been arrested. If this had been reported sooner, measures could have been taken to prevent it.\n\nI would recommend that a solution of 1 lb. Sal Soda to 3 gallons of clear lime water be used, using one gallon of the solution every three weeks and blowing two inches water from the boilers every week.\n\nThe test cocks and water gauge must be overhauled and repacked. The main stop valve must be repacked. The fusible plug must be renewed. The Steam Gauge is correct. I have issued a Certificate allowing a steam pressure of 5 lbs. and condition, on account of pitting, fair.\n\nBOILER NO. 44411 B.C.\n\nI gave this boiler a careful hammer test and found that all stays, rivets and plates were in good condition. I then gave it a Hydrostatic Test, but could not complete it as several tubes were leaking at the top tube sheet. These must be re-expanded and will last a little longer.\n\nThe internal condition of this boiler is very poor. It has the appearance of being badly used. Steam must have been raised too quickly as the tubes have the appearance of being badly burnt and will require renewing next summer.\n\nThe test cocks, water gauge and blowoff cock are in good condition. The Safety Valve works freely by hand.\n\nI must now state that the boilers of this plant have been neglected, but better results are expected with the new Engineer.\n\nI have issued a Certificate allowing a steam pressure of 125 lbs., but condition fair.\n\nLAUNDRY.\n\nIt consists of one large double washing machine and one 26\" Hydro extractor. These are in good condition, but a new pipe guard must be placed around the belt end of the washing machine. The materials are at the School and the work can be done by the Staff.\n\nFRESH WATER SERVICE.\n\nThe water supply is pumped from the Lake. The pumps are connected together and have independent shutoff valves on the discharge line, but there are no relief valves between the shutoff on the discharge and the pumps. One should be installed, as if these valves are closed and the pumps started, a serious breakdown of the pump might occur. At present, the pump house, pumps and gasoline engine are in a very dirty condition which will contaminate the drinking water if not attended to.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6444, file 881-5, part 4)\nCOLD STORAGE.\n\nThis is of the direct expansion type. The expansion mains have been allowed to get badly corroded and there is an ammonia leak in the Fresh Meat Room. These must be attended to, the mains cleaned off and painted with Black Asphaltum.\n\nELECTRIC LIGHT PLANT.\n\nA new plant is being installed, but upon looking at the specifications I noticed that there is no guarantee of performance except a 48-hour run after installation.

F.

John Redden Company, Limited, 1294 Granville Street, Vancouver, B.C., has given no guarantee for a year or any period on this plant except that the firm undertakes to operate the plant for 40 hours after its installation at the end of which time the firm's responsibility for the plant's efficiency ceases. Mr. Arnall considers that a clause should have been inserted in the agreement whereby a guarantee would be given for a period of one year from the date of its installation so that any defects therein might be remedied thereafter.\n\nIn view of the fact that this matter has not been dealt with through this office and I have no copy of the specifications for the above mentioned plant, all I am able to do is to call the Department's attention to Mr. Arnall's representations. It is understood from Mr. Arnall that he mentioned the matter to Dr. McGill during the recent interview with him at Alert Bay and it is possible that Dr. McGill may have taken a note of this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas.

I also beg to attach hereto a letter which I have received from the Rev. Principal which deals particularly with the offer of his predecessor stating that the School authorities would stand a proportion of the total cost of the plant, their offer being $1500-00. I would respectfully refer you to your letter of June the 9th., last File No. 163-1-5 authorising the purchase of the plant on the understanding that the School authorities would put up the $1500-00. However, the Rev. Principal, the Rev. L.H. Rivet states quite frankly in his letter that they have not got money to do this and furthermore that Father Coccolo did not have the authority to make such an offer, owing to the fact that he knew at the time that a new Principal was to be appointed.\n\nUnder the circumstances I am submitting this Voucher in its entirety to the Department for consideration and if possible payment as it will not look well to the Redden Company should payment be withheld. My suggestion would be that the account in question be paid and then to get the School authorities to pay their share as soon as their finances will permit.\n\nI might say in closing that I happen to know that financial conditions at the School are not good, in fact there is an overdraft at the Bank and it would appear that all available funds had been expended prior to the date at which the present Principal took charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.

I was more than surprised; for at that time, Father Cocoola was notified that a new Principal was appointed. Therefore, Father Cocoola was not qualified and had no authority at all to make such a promise.\n\nI asked him the other day where he would have found the money! But no answer. We owe over $4000.00 at present, I have not paid the men for the last month. I had to foot up the bill for a carload of potatoes with my private money; the potato crop in this district has been a complete failure.\n\nYou know, my dear Mr. Moore: I am very interested in the school work, I want to cooperate with the Government as far as possible and show results. But I am not going to stand for any foolish promise of my predecessor. If the Government insist and want the Lejac School to pay that $1500.00 towards the Light Plant, Ottawa is better to look for another Principal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Principal had to make arrangements to have some repairs done to it before the pupils returned to School, the results being that after his mechanic had disassembled the oven he found the trouble and it was discovered that in so far as the oven proper was concerned it was just as good as the day it was first installed, with the exception of the smoke pipes, dampers and other parts of a similar nature, these were all burned out and the Principal replaced them, had them installed and now the oven is as good as ever and is giving satisfactory service, as it did in the beginning, or when it was new.\n\nAll this is leading up to the fact that I beg to attach hereto a Voucher in favour of the Rev. Principal for $53.21 being in payment of the repairs which he put into the oven. He submitted those accounts to me with the request that I forward them to the Department pointing out that by his action it will not be necessary to replace the bake oven for several years, and the Department for that reason will save considerable money owing to the fact that a new oven was included in the estimates this year.\n\nIf the Department can see its way clear to pay this Voucher to the Rev. Principal at this time I would be greatly obliged, if not please advise if it could and will be paid next spring as soon as the new estimates are brought down.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.

The leaky tube reported last year has\nbeen renewed. The brickwork is under repair and when\nfinished will be in good condition.\n\nThe Safety Valve is set to blow off at the required\npressure. The Steam gauge is 2 lbs. light.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure\nof 15 lbs. and condition good.\n\nBoiler #22461.\n\nOn the same date I gave this boiler a similar\ninspection and found it in the same condition as Boiler\nNo. 22460. The steam gauge is 1 lb. light.\n\nI have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure\nof 15 lbs. and condition good.\n\nBoth these boilers are very much improved over last\nyear.\n\nWhilst I was there, the question of hot water for the\ndomestic supply was raised. I recommended that a\nsteam coil be installed in the storage tank and steam\nbe supplied from the main boilers. If this is done,\nit will help the situation considerably.\n\nThese boilers are high pressure boilers with a special\nlow pressure spring on the safety valves. If new\n25 lb. springs were procured and a pressure of 25 lbs.\ncarried on them and a reducing valve installed on the\nsteam heating mains, then all the hot water required\nin the building and laundry would be available and\nmost of the excessive load on the laundry boiler would be easily relieved.\n\nBoiler No. 44411.\n\nOn the same date I gave this boiler a careful internal and external inspection and found it in very good condition. This boiler has been retubed since my last inspection.\n\nI gave it a Hydrostatic Test of 195 lbs. and found it perfectly tight. This boiler is much too small for the amount of work required and if my suggestions are adopted will last for some years. If not, then a new boiler will be required in a very short time.\n\nI set the safety valve to blow off at 130 lbs. The steam gauge is correct. I have issued a certificate allowing a steam pressure of 130 lbs., and condition good.\n\nAuxiliary Machinery.\n\nThe new Lister semi-diesel electric lighting plant is installed and working fairly satisfactory, but considerable trouble is experienced with carbon deposits in the exhaust pipes which necessitates frequent cleaning. With a slight alteration of the exhaust pipe, it will be helped.\n\nThis unit is on the small side and will need enlarging in the near future or a peak load unit installed.\n\nAll the recommendations of my last report have been carried out, the new guards installed, the water pumps cleaned, etc. In fact, I was very much pleased upon the whole condition of the plant. From appearances, this plant will be in splendid condition in the near future.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.J.

Rivet, O.M.I., Principal of the Lejac Indian Residential School which has to do with the new root cellar at that Institution. In this connection I would refer you to the 1934-45 Estimates from this Agency, page 8, in which $2000-00 was requested for the purpose of constructing a cellar for roots and fruit. This cellar has been required for some time in the very worst way. I would respectfully request that you advise me at the earliest possible date if we may expect the money to construct the cellar this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nEnclosure.\nMr. R. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore,\n\nSince taking over the principalship of the Lejac Indian School in August 1933, it has come to my attention that in past years there has been practically no vegetable crops grown on our property. This seems very strange insomuch as surrounding farmers manage to produce successfully and sufficiently both for their own needs and for marketing. It would therefore appear that poor management has, in the past, been responsible for the failures along this line.\n\nWith so many mouths to feed and so many extra necessities required, it is quite evident that a radical change is needed and the school produce its own necessities of life. I am fully convinced that what others can do so can we with proper care and management. This year I have a certificated gardener in charge of the garden and I am very determined to see my desires accomplished; that is, to have an over supply of vegetables to carry the school over the next winter. We already have 22 acres of ground in preparation for vegetables alone.\n\nHowever, there will not be much sense in producing the crop if we have no place in which to store it. For that reason I write to solicit aid from the Department in the construction of a new root cellar. As you already are aware, ours is in a very poor condition. It is constructed in a rather haphazard way which will result in its one day caving in and perhaps causing injury to limb or body. Many of the logs used were poplar and as you well know Poplar wood will not stand the weather conditions and soon decay. Besides its improper construction will not allow for our zero weather and only with much difficulty do we manage to keep our vegetables from freezing.\n\nA larger root cellar is also a necessity insomuch as, as I represent the Department here, they expect me to get results and for the same reason I am determined to see the ambitions of the Department realized and the school's good name re-claimed.\nAt an earlier period in the school's history, the Department contemplated allotting sufficient funds for the erection of a concrete cellar. I disfavor this move because concrete is a conductor of cold and in our northern country such a building would not be advisable. Secondly, a building consisting of the dimensions we require, in concrete would cause the Department an outlay in the vicinity of from 10 to 12 thousand dollars. The same building could be erected from logs properly hewed and seasoned for about two thousand dollars. A properly constructed root cellar will give many years of service and there is no danger of freezing nor cracking caused by the frosts.\n\nThe building we will require would be 100 ft. long by 32 ft. wide, dug into the ground and timbered with 6 bins along each side and a 6 ft. aisle in the centre. Each bin will have a separate ventilator extending through the roof which will be 5 ft. above the ceiling.\n\nThe school is not in a position to meet the cost of constructing such a building and our present cellar will not suffice for another year. It seems a pity that for lack of accommodation we are compelled to harvest a smaller crop than will supply our own requirements when we have the land, the time, and the ability to produce our own needs.\n\nI would, therefore, greatly appreciate your co-operation in presenting our cause to the Department and, if possible, obtaining their help in our need for a new root cellar.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nRev.

He recommends that a steam coil be installed in the storage tank and steam be supplied from the main boilers. If this is done, it will help the situation considerably.\n\nThe Engineer states, further, that if new 25 lb. springs were procured and a pressure of 25 lbs. carried on them and a reducing valve installed on the steam heating mains, then all the hot water required in the building and laundry would be available and most of the excessive load on the laundry boiler would be easily relieved.\n\nThe Engineer says that he was much pleased with the whole condition of the plant.\n\nI would request that you draw the suggestions of the Engineer to the attention of the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I must say that this is one of the best Schools I have yet visited. The principal, from all accounts, has money of his own, and has apparently spent a considerable amount of it for repairs and improvements. He feels that the Department is not supporting him as well as we should. However, I convinced him otherwise.\n\nI authorized Mr. Moore to buy paint to the value of $250.00. This is the only amount specially provided in this year's appropriation for this School.\n\nHowever, they really require a building to store their flour and other food-stuffs. As you are aware, this School is located in a very inaccessible place and they are obliged to carry heavy supplies of food and, as a result, a suitable storeroom is absolutely necessary. Mr. Moore states that if he were authorized to incur an expenditure of $1,000.00 for lumber and other material, a suitable building could be built. All the labour would be supplied by the School staff. While this amount is not provided in this year's vote, I feel that it is an expenditure that should be incurred - not only because it is required, but also it will show the principal that the Department wishes to co-operate with him in the splendid work that I feel that he is doing. I should therefore appreciate if you would take up this matter at once, and if the necessary authority can be secured Mr. Agent Moore should be advised. You can depend on Mr. Moore to handle the matter in a proper manner.\n\nThe principal also requested 300 sq. ft. of Battleship Linoleum, and 3 new sewing machines. No doubt you can arrange to have these purchased.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Principal made a request at that time that the Department supply battleship linoleum for the kitchen floor at the School. This floor is cement and apparently it is very hard on the feet of the cooks and it was felt that if linoleum was put down it might correct the situation. I do not remember exactly what Mr. Phelan said but I am inclined to think that he suggested that I write about this for the necessary authority sometime in August.

Parts missing off both and of no further use at the school and will lose what little value it now has. Purchasers want to know your decision, by wire.\"\n\nMr. Moore is being informed that the matter has been turned over to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Parker,\nActing Secretary.\n\nLt.

However, Mr. Barry visited the School this fall, (the first time in three years) and apparently gave the Rev. Principal hopes that the cellar would be authorised this fall on his recommendation. Please write me in this regard as Mr. Barry's promises seems to have raised high hopes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nNOTE:- For attention of Mr. Phelan.\nOttawa, October 11, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing copy of letter received from the Principal of the Lejac Indian Residential School with reference to the root cellar. As you are aware, the Department has expended considerable money at this school this year, and our Appropriation will not permit supplying the funds required for the erection of the root cellar.\n\nInspector Barry had no right to encourage the Principal in thinking that the root cellar would be allowed this year.\n\nFor your information, I may say that new instructions regarding his duties have recently been issued to Mr. Barry. In future, Mr. Barry will not be required to report on the maintenance and repairs of buildings. The Indian Agent, in future, will be expected to make recommendations in this regard. Mr. Barry will confine his efforts to the assistance of teachers and general inspection of the operation of the schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nMr. R.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nInasmuch as the season for harvesting our vegetable crops is close at hand, it is well that we again present our cause for a new root-cellar to the Department. Weather conditions have been most favourable resulting in an abundant yield, which, unless we receive some consideration, will be left a prey to the winter's cold and frosts.\n\nAs you are aware, the housing capacity of our present root-cellar is inadequate and will not answer our requirements for space needed to cope with the vegetable returns from our gardens. Also, were it possible to store the entire returns, we could not hope to keep them from freezing and thereby losing the profits of a whole season's labour.\n\nWith an ever vanishing hope in view, that we may expect the Department to lend an ear to our cause, we have from year to year repaired and re-repaired our present cellar trusting that the winter would not be too severe. However, after the resulting affects from the past winter we deem it useless to add further expense to a cellar which will not suffice to meet our needs and unless we may expect the necessary aid from the Department it is ridiculous for us to utilize soil in raising vegetables which might otherwise be put to good advantage.\n\nOn the recent visit of Mr. Barry, inspector, to our school, he strongly recommended the need of a new and larger root-cellar. With his recommendation going forth I feel certain that our cause will at least meet with success.\n\nOn Mr. Barry's suggestion I am taking the liberty of again bringing this matter to your attention and feel confident that I may expect the usual careful co-operation from your part.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nSigned: M.M. Rivet, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\nVanderhoof, B.C., September 23rd, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI would respectfully direct your attention to your letter of July 2nd, last File No. 167-1-5 wherein you authorize the expenditure of certain monies for improvements at the Lejac Indian Residential School. In the second paragraph of your letter you instructed that all labour was to be supplied by the School Staff without expense to the Department. This I can assure you was the intention and the understanding that was arrived at when Mr. Phelan was here but it so happened that the Rev. Principal found it necessary to bring back some of the more advanced Indian boys who were home on holidays to assist on the work on the understanding that they would be paid one dollar per day. While this work was good training for the boys it was not possible to postpone the building of the store room until the School opened again at the end of August as the supplies would arrive about the middle of August and consequently some place had to be prepared, hence the rush. The rest of the labour in connection with the building was done by the School Staff and I would recommend that these boys be paid as per the attached account. If you would have cheques made out in favour of the boys whose names are shown here and sent to the Rev. Principal, I could deliver them to those concerned.\n\nLabour return forms are also attached which I trust you will find satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.H.

C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn several occasions in the past, the school has asked the Department for a new root cellar and Piggery. Our need for these two buildings has been explained and re-explained in each requisition but as far as we seem able to get is the more exacting of a promise that our requirements will receive consideration.\n\nLast fall we stored a sufficient quantity of roots and vegetables to carry the school over the entire season; but with the disadvantages to be gained by storing in a rather improvised cellar resulted in the ruin of at least one third of our crop.\n\nIn order to cultivate sufficient vegetables and roots to cover the needs of both the school and the stock, we require more and better storage room and, consequently, as well as a new cellar being sorely needed so also is a larger one.\n\nDue to the loss of our piggery by fire, we deemed it advisable to butcher a number of brood sows we were considering keeping for the purpose of increasing our stock. Housing accommodation is scarce and if the Department does not soon see fit to grant the construction of a new piggery we shall have to dispose of our entire stock of hogs.\n\nThe foundation of the burned pig-sty can yet be used to raise a new building upon, while the stanchions, though burned and twisted, can be straightened and will again serve the purpose of serviceable pens. The only extra cost would be the enlarging to accommodate two extra pens.\n\nWe estimate that the total outlay, to cover both buildings, will be between $3500 and $4000 and should it occur that the Department's intentions have grown beyond the verge of a promise we should greatly appreciate knowing, at once, so that excavation work may be commenced as soon as the ground thaws.\n\nTrusting to be favored with your co-operation in this matter which means so much to the school, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nL.

H. Rutt\nSir:\n\nI would respectfully direct your attention to your letter of October the 21st, ultimo, File No. 163-1-5, relative to the sale of an engine and generator from the Nasko Indian Residential School to Taylor Brothers of Vanderhoof, and to my reply of November the 9th inst., with attached cheque for $100-00 covering the price offered.\n\nIn the above connection I beg to attach hereto a letter received from this firm and which I trust you will find self explanatory. I might say that I was very much annoyed when I found the condition of the crank shaft of this engine as it was nothing but wanton destruction for any man to hammer a shaft the way this one had just to get the fly wheel off. Unfortunately it was not possible to detect the damage until after the engine was put in running shape with the wheels etc. on. So, naturally Taylor Brothers could not tell whether it was damaged or not. This has been an unfortunate condition as the Firm seem to think that they got the worst of a bad bargain and while they realise that it was their own offer which the Department accepted they are not complaining.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would suggest that the Department would go fifty-fifty with Taylor Brothers in the price of a new shaft. Of course I cannot let you know what the shaft would cost as Taylor Brothers have not found out themselves. Please advise in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure.\nNovember 18th 1935\n\nThe Department Of Indian Affairs,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nAttn R.H.Moore.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRecently we purchased from your department a F.M. 10 H.P. type Z engine and a F.M. 5000 watt generator in a knocked down condition it being understood by us that this machine was in running condition before disassembly.\n\nWe examined the various parts of this machine as far as was possible allowing of course for a certain amount of replacement of worn bearings, piston rings etc to put the machine in good mechanical condition. A certain amount of the parts had to be taken on good faith since we had not the means of testing.\n\nWe have now assembled the motor and find that the crankshaft is sprung evidently done in dissembling, the shaft shows hammer marks which were noticed before but were not considered of serious import since it is hard to believe that any mechanical person would sledge a crankshaft to remove the flywheels but this seems to have been done.\n\nThe above condition could not have been detected without putting the shaft in a lathe or assembling the motor and testing since there is not a lathe, of sufficient size to swing this shaft, available in this community and we are unable to tell how much the shaft is out of true but it is sufficient that the bearing on one side cannot be fitted and consequently means the purchase of a new crankshaft since the hammering was done on the side of the crank-arm and has probably thrown the connecting rod also out of line.\nThe expense to date for parts for this machine has reached the sum of $95.00 which includes a new magneto that we had to purchase.\n\nThe above is for your information only.\n\nYours truly,\nTaylor Bros.\n\nPer.\nVanderhoof, B.C., November 18th, 1955.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nAttn R.H.

In this connection I would request that you will state if you disposed of this equipment to Taylor Brothers. If so, you should forward, as soon as possible, the amount of $100.00, which the above firm agreed to pay for the engine and generator.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof,\nB. C.\nOttawa, October 31, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Lejac Indian Residential School, in which he reports on the recent fire which resulted in the burning of the piggery and contents.\n\nThe loss occasioned the school by the destruction of this building is regretted. The Department will have no funds during the present fiscal year, to provide the cost of erecting a new piggery. When our Estimates are being prepared for the next fiscal year, consideration will be given to providing the funds required in the erection of a new piggery and also a root-house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof,\nB. C.\nVanderhoof, B.C., October 21st., 1935.\n\nSir:-\n\nI beg to attach hereto a letter from the Rev. Principal Rivet regarding a fire at the Lejac Indian Residential School recently, and which burned the piggery.\n\nFor the information of the Department I wish to advise that I have already investigated the cause of the fire and its origin, and from information received I feel that it was caused through the chimney being cracked above the ceiling and below the roof. There had been a lot of cooking done for the pigs in the building the day of the fire and I think that the chimney got over heated and possibly smouldering set in somewhere and eventually broke out in flame. I am satisfied that no blame can be attached to anyone as it was purely an accident.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nEnclosure.\nMr. R. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nHerewith, I beg to submit the report of the recent fire which resulted in fatal damage to the school piggery.\n\nAt 12:25 A.M. on the morning of October 9th, 1935, the blaze was first noticed by one of the employees who immediately sounded the alarm. The school fire alarm system was set into motion and it was at first taken as a night fire drill. Within two minutes the school was cleared of all occupants and upon ascertaining the cause the bigger boys were immediately put to work in an effort to keep the fire under control, while the girls and smaller boys were rushed back into their dormitories.\n\nWithin four minutes all forms of fire-fighting apparatus were on the site of the conflagration where boys and employees were working heroically to keep the blaze under subjection. Much effort and attention had to be centered on the surrounding buildings in order to avert other casualties and only due to the calmness of the weather and the concentration of the fire-fighters were we able to save them.\n\nHowever, due to the fact that before being noticed, the fire had gotten away to a good start it was impossible to save the piggery from complete demolition.\n\nCoincident with the loss of the building were 2 small week old pigs; 4 chickens; and about 4 tons of threshed oats which were being stored in an upper storey of the piggery.\n\nThe foundation is still in perfect shape and though the iron stanchions are badly burned and twisted, it is considered they can be straightened and re-used.\n\nThis catastrophe leaves the school without housing accommodation for its hogs and it is to be hoped that we may soon be allowed a grant from the Department covering the $1000.00 which is estimated to be necessary to rebuild our loss.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nL.

In discussing this matter further with the Rev. Principal we felt that the cost of the linoleum would take too much out of the $300-00 approved and there would not be enough left out of it to do the other repairs and make new benches and cupboards. I might say that it is my intention to buy the material for this and have the work done at the school. There is however quite a lot of plastering to be done where the plaster has broken and crumbled away, then of course all of it will have to be resurfaced. In the meantime it might be well to allow the linoleum to stand unordered, unless, of course the Department could see its way clear to providing that over and above the $300-00 allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRmk/L.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 17, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, please let me know the length and width of the boys' recreation hall. The linoleum for this room will be ordered direct from the Department, as we can secure same at a reasonable cost.\n\nRegarding the new benches and cupboards, is it your intention to buy the material and have these made at the school? If so, you may purchase the material required from firms on the approved list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nVanderhoof, B.C., July 9th., 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI would respectfully direct your attention to Official letter of April the 9th. last File No. 163-1-5 relative to the question of repairs and improvements at the Lejac Indian Residential School. In regard to the last paragraph of your letter I wish to advise that after discussion with the Principal we decided that the $300-00 available for repairs should be expended in the boys' recreation hall to provide new benches, cupboards and battleship linoleum on the floor. The Rev. Principal would appreciate an early reply to this request so that the necessary repairs may be made during the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 9, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the first instant, enclosing communication received from the Principal of the Lejac Indian Residential School, requesting authority to proceed with the erection of a new piggery. It is noted, from the Principal's letter, that he estimates the total outlay covering the cost of the building required at $3,500.\n\nThe Department realizes that the buildings requested by the Principal are, no doubt, necessary in the best interests of the school, but, at the same time, it must be realized that the Department is unable to proceed with considerable necessary work, due to present economic conditions, which make it impossible for us to secure an appropriation sufficiently large to cover all the expenditures that we are requested to make. It is regretted that the funds for the buildings at the Lejac School could not be provided in the current year's appropriation, but the Principal and yourself will understand that this was due to circumstances over which we have no control.\n\nThe only amount available in the current year's appropriation for the Lejac School is the sum of $300.00 for miscellaneous repairs. You might let me know how you consider this amount should be spent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoef, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to attach herewith a letter just received from the Rev. Principal of the Lejac Indian Residential School which I trust you will find self explanatory.\n\nIn the above connection I wish to point out that the information contained in Official Letter of October 31st, 1935 File No. 163-1-5 was conveyed to the Principal at that time. He is however, (as you will note from his letter) very anxious to be advised as soon as possible whether or not it will be possible to have both buildings, root house and piggery, built this year. I can understand this as naturally there would be little use in planting vegetables and roots this Spring unless he knows that he will have someplace to store them next winter.\n\nIf you would be kind enough to advise me in this connection as soon as you know what we may expect, I would greatly appreciate your kindness.\n\nYour obedient servant;\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary:\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nVanderhoof, B.C., February 1st, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to attach hereto two letters received from the Principal of the Lejac Indian Residential School which I trust you will find self explanatory.\n\nIn connection with the one referring to fire equipment I wish to advise that I know from the recent inspection made by myself that the fire hose was replaced and that some of the rest of it not yet replaced, should be. It would appear that the material in the pipes has naturally deteriorated, whether from lack of use, or from being stored near the fire risk in a building that might be too warm. The Principal thinks, however, that these two lengths of hose already purchased by the Principal were required and three more lengths should be purchased as soon as possible.\n\nRegarding the rooms for the disciplinarians in the boys' and girls' dormitories, I would recommend that the material necessary to put up thin frame partitions around the beds in the dormitories, be approved. I know that the rooms provided for the disciplinarians have not been used for years but I did not know until a few days ago that they had been condemned as unfit to sleep in. Who did the condemning? I don't know. If the Department can see its way clear to approve of the purchase of the material necessary for this purpose, I would be greatly obliged.\n\nThe Principal advises me that the cheque for the Per Capita Grant for the School arrived a few days ago but it was almost $600-00 short. It would appear as if the cheque should have amounted to $7224-00 and the amount received was $6620-00. The Principal has asked me to explain the difference. Please advise me in this connection also.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRHM/L.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnclosures.\nOttawa, January 27th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 21st instant, you may forward, for payment, a voucher amounting to $45.45 covering the cost of the material purchased for repairs to the recreation hall at the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. H. Moore Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nVanderhoof, B.C., January 21st, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI would respectfully direct your attention to official letter of July 31st last File No. 165-1-5 authorising an expenditure of $300-00 for repairs at the Lejac Indian Residential School. Two Vouchers were submitted for material for these repairs, one in favour of McLennan, McFeely & Prior; Voucher No. 8923 amounting to $200-49 and the other in favour of The Fraser Lake Sawmills, Ltd.; Voucher No. 8924 amounting to $99-43, both these Vouchers were paid and with the exception of eight cents, the total amount was used up.\n\nHowever, the Rev. Father Rivet, then Principal of the School, purchased further material from the Fraser Lake Sawmills to complete the work amounting to $45-45 which the Principal planned to pay for himself rather than leave the work uncompleted. However, before the Rev. Father Rivet could give the matter his attention he was relieved of the Principalship of the School and moved to another part of the Dominion, the result is that this account for $45-45 is still unpaid. I did not know until today that this account was unpaid and consequently have not had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the present Principal to say whether or not he will carry out Father Rivet's intention. Should he not be prepared to do this I would request the Department to advise me if they would assume payment, for really the material was needed and went into the recreation hall at that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.

Our funds for this purpose are entirely assigned and it is considered that, with the exercise of reasonable care by the Principal and staff, there should be no danger of fire at this school, as it is a modern, semi-fireproof building. However, should the Principal desire to have a night watchman, the Department would have no objection but we would be unable to provide any part of the cost of salary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore,\n\nYou will remember that I called your attention to the fact that the rooms for the disciplinarians in the dormitories for the boys and the girls have not been used for some years as they were found to be unfit for the purpose for which they were intended. No outside window, no proper ventilation and no heating are the outstanding objections. At present those in charge of the dormitories have to content themselves with curtains round their beds. It would be quite easy without interfering with the necessary air-space for the dormitories, to provide a little room which would overcome these inconveniences, give the necessary privacy to those in charge and remove from the children the temptation to steal little things when an opportunity occurs.\n\nThe carpenter and the boys would do all the work and all that the Dept. would have to pay for would be the actual material used.\n\nI would be glad if you could take this up with the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore,\n\nShortly after my arrival at the School, I made an inspection of the fire-fighting equipment and found that the fire hose was so worn out that it would not possibly stand up under pressure. Rather than risk being caught unprepared, I decided to order two lengths (50 feet each) for the boys' dormitories and to ask for permission afterwards. At the same time two fire-alarm bells for the boys' dormitories were ordered. According to the catalog of McLennan, McFeely and Prior of Vancouver, the hose will cost $67.75 and the bells $12.86, making a total of $80.61.

If you consider that the additional hose, viz., 3 - 50 ft. lengths with necessary couplings, is absolutely required, you may arrange for its purchase.\n\nThe Department approves your supplying the material required to place thin frame partitions around the beds used by the disciplinarians. It is expected, of course, that you will keep the expenditure as low as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to attach hereto two letters received from the principal of the Lejac Indian Residential School which I trust you will find self explanatory.\n\nIn connection with the one referring to fire equipment I wish to advise that I know from the recent inspection made by myself that the fire hose was replaced and that some of the rest of it, not yet replaced, should be, as it would appear that the material in the pipes just naturally deteriorated; whether from lack of use, or from being stored on the fire rack in a building that might be too warm. The principal thinks, however, that these two lengths of hose already purchased by the principal were required and three more lengths should be purchased as soon as possible.\n\nRegarding the rooms for the disciplinarians in the boys' and girls' dormitories, I would recommend that the material necessary to put up thin frame partitions around the beds in the dormitories be approved. I know that the rooms provided for the disciplinarians have not been used for years but I did not know until a few days ago that they had been condemned as unfit to sleep in. Who did the condemning I don't know. If the Department can see its way clear to approve of the purchase of the material necessary for this purpose, I would be greatly obliged.\n\nThe principal advises me that the cheque for the Per Capita Grant for the School arrived a few days ago but it was almost $600-00 short. It would appear as if the cheque should have amounted to $724-00 and the amount received was $640-00. The principal has asked me to explain the difference. Please advise me in this connection also.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nRm/L.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnclosures.\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\nLEJAC, B.C.\n\nJune 9th 1937\n\nMr. R.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to the letter of May 7th from the Department concerning the pumping system and the septic tank, I am now in a position to give you the results of the enquiries I have made.\n\n1. With regard to the pumping system, nothing can be done at the present moment to install the proper piping between the lake and the pumps. This will have to be attended to when the lake level drops next fall. In the meantime we have managed to make temporary repairs so that the water is brought in from some distance from the lake shore and the water is therefore fit to use without being boiled.\n\n2. With reference to the septic tank and the proposal to install a grease trap to prevent the soap from the laundry going into the septic tank, I have had an opportunity of discussing the whole question with the school engineer and a competent plumber and this is what we would recommend for the consideration of the Department.\n\n   1. We would like to have the plans of the sewer system of the whole school. I suppose these must be in Ottawa.\n   2. It seems probable that drain pipes from the heating system of the school run underneath the septic tank and it would be a simple matter to connect the waste pipes from the laundry to these drain pipes and obviate the necessity of having a grease trap either inside or outside the building.\n   3. At present the drain pipe from the heating system is blocked and we hope in a short time to have the trouble located. This will be done as soon as we have been able to make a few minor repairs to the septic tank outlet. If the stoppage is due to a cave-in, it will require a certain amount of work to find the trouble as the pipes are two feet lower than the furnace room and are therefore ten or twelve feet below the ground. The Engineer tells me that the pipes from the heating system will have to be fixed up anyway before the Boiler Inspector comes, sometime next month. We cannot empty the boilers until we have located and remedied the stoppage.\n\n4. If our information is correct, we would then suggest connecting the laundry waste pipes with the heating system and if necessary divert the flow off from the septic tank. I am told that this would not be very difficult. The plumber tells me that this is the easiest and best remedy for our present difficulties. What we need is the authorisation to have the pipe from the heating system...\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\nLEJAC, B.C.\n\nexamined and if necessary, dug up and repaired. There is a distance of about four hundred feet between the boiler room and the septic tank and the pipe is blocked somewhere between these two points. If it is blocked or caved in near the septic tank, not much digging will be required. It may be possible to clear the pipes by water pressure but so far we have not succeeded and every attempt we have made to empty the boilers has resulted in the basement of the school being flooded. As I have already pointed out this will have to be looked into even if we do not use this pipe for the laundry water.\n\nI hope I have succeeded in making clear the remedy we recommend. I imagine that it will be quite easy to follow after the plans of the school sewer system have been studied.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRev. W. Byrne-Grant, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, May 7th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 19th ultimo, enclosing letter received from the Principal of the Lejac Indian Residential School with reference to the pumping system.\n\nAfter carefully considering the Principal's letter, it is felt that the following improvements to the pumping system should be made at once:\n\n(1) The tile pipes at present used to convey the water from the iron pipes in the lake to the pumps should be removed and replaced with sealed joint metal pipe.\n\n(2) If further investigation shows that the intake pipe is cut off close to the shore, this pipe should be extended several hundred feet into the lake.\n\n(3) With regard to the laundry and kitchen outlets and the interruption of the normal action of the septic tank, the only remedy is installation of grease traps. Two types of traps are possible:\nFirst, a trap of concrete construction for installation outdoors. Such traps have to be cleaned frequently and, therefore, should be located at a point where the loose earth or cover may be removed and replaced without trouble. Within reason, this trap should be located as far as possible from the building and to the leeward to minimize objectionable odours.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\nodours which always follow the grease trap cleaning operation.\n\nThe second type, and possibly the most economical for this case, is the installation of a metal trap indoors on the waste line of the lines carrying grease or oil. This does not mean the main sewage line but only the branch wastes from the kitchen sink and laundry. If these two sources are united before reaching the main waste, one trap would serve the purpose. These indoor traps offer greater convenience for cleaning and may be used if the odour arising during their cleaning operation is not a serious objection.\n\nIt is not possible for the Department to decide which type of trap is the most economical or the most applicable in the case of the Lejac Indian Residential School. This will have to be decided by the Principal and yourself after consulting a competent plumber.\n\nProvision has been made in the current year's appropriation for the sum of $300.00 for miscellaneous repairs at the Lejac Indian Residential School. It is considered that the above work can be done for less than this amount. You may, therefore, proceed with the work on this understanding but, if preliminary estimates show that the cost involved is more than the amount mentioned, you should communicate with the Department before proceeding.\n\nIf the above work is done promptly, it is hoped that it will result in an improved quality of water. In the meantime, the water used for drinking purposes should, of course, be boiled.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hosey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\nRe Water Supply\n\n1. The portion of supply pipe should be removed and replaced with sealed joint metal pipe.\n\n2. If contaminated water & purification, this matter should be taken up with Dr. Stone.\n\n3. If intake is cut off close to shore, this should be extended several hundred feet.\n\nWith regards to the Laundry & Kitchen outlets & the interruption of the normal action of the siphon tank, the only remedy is the installation of grease traps.\n\nTwo types of traps are possible:\n\n1. Concrete traps constructed for installation outdoors. These traps have to be cleaned regularly frequently.\n\n2. The first type should be located at a point where the main sewer or drain may be opened & repaired without trouble. Within reason, this trap should be located as far as possible from the building so as to be removed to minimize objection to the odor which always follows the grease trap cleaning operation.\n\nThe second type, and possibly the most economical in this case as it is a metal trap installed indoors at the angle line of the lines carrying grease water. This does not mean the main sewage line but only the waste wastes from the kitchen sink and laundry. If these two wastes are united before reaching the main waste, one trap would serve both purposes.\n\nThis offers greater convenience for cleaning, and may be used if the housewife wishes their cleaning operation is not a serious objection. Consideration as to the most economical applicable type of traps would have to be made at this juncture.\nVanderhoof, B.C., April 19th, 1937.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to attach herewith a letter received from the Rev. Principal of the Lejac Indian Residential School which I trust you will find self explanatory.\n\nWith reference to this matter I wish to advise that it has been discussed off and on once or twice a year for the past three or four years but unfortunately no definite solution could be arrived at, and temporary measures were taken to allow the system to function for the time being.\n\nIt would appear now that something definite will have to be done and I personally am not qualified to give an intelligent estimate on what the work will cost, in fact I am not sure that I know just what will be necessary, although I think that if new pipes were laid farther out in the lake that it would answer the purpose and relieve us of all future trouble, providing of course, that the pipes laid were of the proper material. At all events I think that the best plan would be to have some contractor from Prince George to look the situation over and give us what he considers the best idea of what would be the right thing to do and its approximate cost.\n\nIf you consider that the septic tank should be attended to at the same time you might please advise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclos.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\nLEJAC, B.C.\n\nApril 16, 1917\n\nMr. R. H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou will remember that on more than one occasion we discussed the trouble that we were having with the pumping system for the water supply. Matters came to a head with the spring thaw and we were obliged to make some temporary repairs in order to keep the pump working and to prevent too much ground water getting into the well. In doing this work our engineer discovered that the pipes used to convey the water from the iron pipes in the lake to the pumps were in a very unsatisfactory condition. Apparently the pipes are the ordinary tile pipes used for drainage; they are porous, merely laid end to end without any covering for the joints and are therefore no use as protection from contamination from the surface water.\n\nAs the overflow from the septic tank, which is not functioning well, drains in the direction of the pump house and as the surface soil in the vicinity of the pump house is exposed to contamination from various sources, I think it is duty to point out that under present conditions, the water supplied to the school cannot be considered safe, and I should be glad if you would kindly lay this matter before the Department at your earliest convenience and ask for instructions.\n\nIt would seem that the first step would be to obtain some chemicals that would make the water fit for drinking and cooking purposes. After the immediate danger has been removed, it would be well to consider having a thorough cleaning or thorough disinfection of the intake system. I understand that several hundred feet of two inch piping have been damaged by the action of the wind and waves. These pipes are now lying at the bottom of the lake. The water pumped to the house is therefore taken near the shore and quite likely to be contaminated.\n\nThe engineer is not prepared to say what it would cost to make the necessary repairs. I believe it would be worth while asking the Department to send a competent man who would be able to make a complete report on the water supply and the septic tank. I understand that the big trouble in connection with the septic tank is that no provision was made for a separate outlet from the laundry and the kitchen, with the result that the scum and fats cling into the septic tank as well as the heavy flow of water from the laundry, preventing the normal functioning of the tank, with the resulting contamination of the field below and the foul smell which comes from the tank. I believe that it has been suggested that there would be no trouble from the tank if it were cleaned out at regular intervals, but experience has proven that this is not the case and the only remedy seems to be to have a separate outlet from the laundry. I do not know whether the foul odors from the tank are dangerous as far as the health of the children is concerned. The boy's playground is near the tank, and they are constantly breathing the contaminated air, and on certain days when...\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\nLEJAC, B.C.\n\nthere is little wind the whole grounds and even the interior of the school is affected by the odor. I do not know whether the attention of the Department has been called to this situation. I feel that is one that should be looked into without delay.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nRev. W. Byrne Grant, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOffice of the Fraser Lake Indian Agency,\n\nFeb. 10th, 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 3469, amounting to $85.45, in favour of Fraser Lake Sawmills, Ltd., Fraser Lake, B.C., for repairs to boys' recreation hall (At the Indian School).\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 163-1-5 dated Jan. 27th, 1937.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 518\nVanderhoof, B.C., June 22nd., 1937.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th ultimo, File No. 162-1-5 relative to the pumping water system, and the sewerage system at the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I gave your letter to the Rev. Principal of the School and asked that he get a plumber to go over the system thoroughly and advise me the results of their examination and what should be done to remedy the matter. The Principal consequently got a plumber in and after examination and deliberation he wrote me giving the results as he saw it of their examination, as well as a possible remedy.\n\nI might say that prior to the date of receipt of your letter temporary arrangements had been made at the School to guard the water supply, which I personally inspected and found that it was perfectly satisfactory until next fall when the lake level lowers and further work can be done.\n\nIn so far as the sewerage system is concerned it was thought that a plan of the whole system at the school would be on file at Ottawa and which the Department might forward to me so that we would not be proceeding with our investigation blindfolded. If this plan does exist and you would be kind enough to send it to me the matter will be further investigated and definite recommendations made later on. The Rev. Principal's letter is enclosed herewith for your information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.

I inspected the kitchen, which was clean and in good order. The children were having for their meal, soup, fish, potatoes, bread and butter.\n\nAll fire appliances were in position and in good order. Dormitories were in good order, and lavatories clean. The septic tank, however, is not working properly, and the overflow smells badly. This, I think, is due to the laundry waste flowing through the same system. As 1500 gallons is used on washing days, soap etc., prevents the correct bacterial action of the septic tank. The laundry waste could be connected, at not too great cost, with the boiler line overflow which empties over some low lying ground. Further, the iron pipe into the lake, from whence the school obtains its water supply, would seem to have got disconnected. This will mean no water supply in the winter and should be investigated and the necessary repairs made. Possibly ice last winter caused this break.\n\nA pig pen is required on the farm. I should suggest that material be supplied and the boys erect the same as part of their manual training.\n\nGeo. S.

H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nRe: Septic Tank and Water Supply.\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence and our recent conversation concerning the water supply and the Septic Tank I beg to report as follows:\n\nWATER TANK.\n\nYou will recall that early this spring before the break up of the ice our engineer installed a box reservoir in order to prevent sand and dirt from entering into the pipes leading into the pumps. Further work was prevented by the break-up of the ice and the subsequent rise of the lake level now that the water has gone down we are in a position to report on the steps necessary to safeguard the purity of our water supply.\n\na. It will be necessary to dig a trench 6' deep and 36' long between the pump house and the reservoir.\n\nb. Another trench 30' long will be required to reach the end of the pipe now lying at the bottom of the lake. We estimate that this will require one week's work for one man.\n\nThe material required will be 30' of the special pipe recommended by the Department and 30' of six inch iron pipe to connect with the 300' now at the bottom of the lake. I have been unable to find any estimate of the cost of these pipes in any of our catalogues.\n\nOnce these two pipes have been installed I think that the purity of our water supply will be assured.\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\nLEJAC, B.C.\n\n(2)\n\nSEPTIC TANK\n\nTo remedy the defect in our septic tank caused by the action of the laundry water, we recommend the following solution:\n\nThe drain pipe of the laundry can be connected with the drain from the boiler room which runs from the school to the hillside without passing through the Septic Tank. To do this it will be necessary to break up 4-10 feet of the cement floor in the basement so as to bring the laundry drain outside the building and to dig a trench one hundred feet long and eight feet deep from that point to the drain from the boiler room. The material required will be one hundred and ten feet of four inch iron pipe which according to the catalogue would be worth about $1.25 per foot.\n\nI believe that counting labour and material this work would cost about $175.\n\nYou will recall that the Department instructed us to refer these questions back to them if the estimate of the costs should be over $300. We have already expended close to $200 this summer in connection with the Septic Tank and Water Supply, the chief item being the services of an experienced Plumber for seventeen days at $2.00 a day and the purchase of a Diaphragm Pump and twenty five feet of hose at the cost of $70. If the Department is prepared to include these two items in their estimate of the cost of the necessary repairs to the two systems I believe that the total cost would be in the neighbourhood of $600 and I feel that the expenditure of this amount would be well justified since it would mean the permanent of a problem that has been a source of trouble for many years past.\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\nLEJAC, B.C.\n\nThe only problem untouched would be that of the accumulation of foul smelling water in the pasture field below the Septic Tank. Possibly this problem will no longer exist if the Septic Tank functions properly and nothing but pure water flows from its second chamber. I understand that according to the original plans the water from the Septic Tank was to be conducted underground to the ditch along the railway tracks but perhaps because the pipes were not laid deep enough to withstand the heaving caused by the frost this pipe system has never functioned and part of the pasture used by the dairy cows of the school has always been a foul smelling bog. Certain amount of criticism has been made on this point and I suppose that the Department should be informed of this situation.\n\nI hope that the details contained in this report will be sufficient to enable the Department to understand the solution that we recommend.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRev.

Byrne-Grant, C.M.I.\nPrincipal\n\nWBC/HB\nOttawa, July 20, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your 23/49530 of the 3rd instant regarding the water, sewerage and heating systems at the Lejac Indian Residential School, it is noted that the Boiler Inspector, Mr. T.

H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nI am enclosing for your information a draft of our estimates for the construction of a new pigery at the school.\n\nOur estimates are based on the experience we had with the building which burned down three years ago and the careful analysis of our books to show the amount of pork and pork products used at the school during the past year.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRev. W. Byrne-Grant, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nPROPOSED PIGERY AT LEJAC SCHOOL\n\nThe figures included in these estimates are based on three major considerations:\n\n1. The quantity of pork and pork products consumed at the school.\n\n2. The climate with its long and severe winter.\n\n3. The probable wishes of the Department that the new building be permanent, well equipped and in keeping with the other farm buildings.\n\n1. The quantity of pork and pork products consumed at the school. A study of our books shows that the consumption of pork can be grouped under three headings:\n   A. Fresh pork, ham and bacon consumed in the school.\n   B. Lard and other by-products\n   C. Bacon and lard given to the Indians in payment for work done.\n\nThese three items work out at about 30lbs a day. During the past year we have purchased nearly one thousand pounds of lard, and an average of one hundred pounds of ham and bacon per month.\n\nSome of this goes to the Indians who work for the school from time to time. Experience has proven that this system is far better than that of paying cash to the Indians since in most cases the cash is usually wasted. This heavy purchase of pork and pork products shows that to meet the requirements of the school at least eight sows are required. The four sows that we keep at present do not supply half our needs.\n\n2. The climate with the long and severe winter. The climate affects both the size and cost of the building.\n\nA. The size, because without adequate protection it is impossible to have more than one litter a year from each sow instead of the two litters required for economical production.\n\nB. The cost, because experience has proven that the concrete footings and foundations usually found in the plans and specifications for buildings of this kind are not deep enough or strong enough to withstand the severe frost and the resultant heaving which takes place in the spring. We find that we use double the amount of cement and gravel in order to assure foundations strong enough to withstand the rigors of our climate.\n\nnew build the probable wishes of the Department that the new building\nPage 2 cont.\n\n4. The probable wishes of the Department that the new building be permanent, well equipped and in keeping with the other farm buildings.\n\nWe have already several fine looking buildings on the farm including a big modern barn, three poultry houses and a calf barn. These are good buildings, well put up, and nicely painted. The new pigery therefore, we think should be built along the same lines and with the same pleasing appearance.\n\nCONSTRUCTION\n\nWe therefore recommend to the Department the construction of a building somewhat larger than the one which was burnt down three years ago. This building was thirty by forty and was far too small for our needs. Unless trouble was caused by having to constantly change the pigs from one pen to another and the crowding together of so many pigs in one small building caused a very high mortality among the young pigs at farrowing time.\n\nDIMENSIONS\n\nDimensions: 38 X 70 X 16 Gable Roof.\nCapacity: 8 Breed Sows and 40 Fattening hogs.\n\nConcrete footing and foundations:\n\nCement 112 sacks @ $1.50 = $168.00\nGravel 50 Cubic yards @ $3.00 = $150.00\n\nFloor:\n\nCement 182 sacks @ $1.50 = $273.00\nGravel 50 Cubic yards @ $3.00 = $150.00\n\nLumber: 10000 feet @ $0.10 per 100 = $100.00\n\nRoofing:\n\n3 ply best quality 50 rolls @ $1.10 = $55.00\n\nNails: 800 pounds @ 7\u00a2 = $56.00\n\nPlumbing and water connections: $100.00\n\nHeating, cooking and interior fixtures, ventilators etc.: $300.00\n\nPaint: $50.00\n\nTotal: $1520.10\n\nP.T.V.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Expensive fittings are not by any means necessary.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Department will only have available in next year's appropriation an amount of $500 which can be allowed the Lejac School, but we have some funds in the current year's appropriation which we could use, if you consider it advisable.\n\nI note in the Principal's letter that approximately a carload of cement will be necessary.

Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nThe Principal's letter refers to the necessity of purchasing sixteen feet of lumber.

Material needed for refilling for present equipment\n   a. Two gallons of Co-mercial Sulphuric Acid.\n   b. Fifty pounds of Bi-carbonate of Soda.\n\n2. New Equipment.\n   a. Half dozen Pyrene Extinguishers without wall brackets.\n   b. Six\u2014fifty feet lengths of ordinary 4 inch Garden Hose with Nozzles and Faucets.\n\nThis garden hose is for the four dormitories and the two recreation rooms which are some distance from the main fire hoses and the engineer feels that these extra hose are really needed in order to have water available in every part of the building.\n\nc. Fifty feet of one and a half inch fire hose with couplings and water valve for girls side of building on second floor to correspond with same equipment on boys side. At present to use the equipment now stationed on boys side in case of fire on the girls side it would be necessary to break through two doors or through the wall.\n\nd. Three hydrants with two inch connections.\n\nOne of these hydrants is needed to replace one broken by the frost. The other two will be used for the barn and out buildings.\n\ne. Twelve fire axes, about one and three quarter pound, and handles to be enclosed in glass faced box for school and out buildings, and twelve fire pails for the same purpose.\n\nRecently a fire occurred in one of the poultry houses and as the fire was inside the walls a considerable occurred in extinguishing it on account of the lack of the axes and water pails.\n\nf. One of the problems that has always worried us in connection with fire escapes is that during the winter months the dripping of melting snow from the roof not only covers the fire escapes with a sheet of ice but also completely seals the windows leading on to the fire escape, prevents the lowering of the bottom landing and on the North side of the building covers the ground at the bottom of the fire escape with sheer ice. The result is that it is impossible to have cont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This would mean the construction of four roofs, each one approximately thirty by eight.\n\nOn more than one occasion the question of this melting snow has been discussed but I do not know whether the suggestion of building roofs over the fire escapes has ever been submitted to the Department.\n\nRev.

Principal which is, I trust, self explanatory. I might say that I discussed this matter at some length with the principal but felt it desirable that the gist of our conversation be submitted in writing so that the Department would have first hand information on the views of the principal.\n\nI think that the various points mentioned in the Department's letter are covered fully by the principal, especially in so far as the storage of the cement and the purchasing of the 1600 feet of lumber is concerned. I would, however, respectfully point out that no intention of erecting an elaborate or showy building is anticipated, but rather one that will be serviceable and give protection to the pigs during the winter months. It was not intended to include the expensive fixtures mentioned in the original report of the principal but rather to show what these fixtures would cost if procured, however, we can get along just as well and just as efficiently by using ordinary wooden gates, feeding troughs and partitions, and the 1600 feet of lumber will be sufficient for that purpose.

Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter enclosing one dated Jany. 22nd concerning the construction of a new piggery.\n\nIn this letter the Department suggests a less expensive building than the one recommended in the original report.\n\nThe original report suggested a building at an estimated cost of $1820 and while reference was made of the estimates furnished by the Beatty Co. of $1200 for modern interior fixtures this item was not considered as part of the original recommendation. By striking out this item altogether the building would cost only $1820.\n\nThis estimate is not high and perhaps the Department would be willing to go as far as possible in contributing towards this amount and the school would pay for the balance out of its own funds and possibly the Department could see its way to reimburse us next year or before the end of the fiscal year 1938-39.\n\nAnother solution would be to figure that on the basis of $1820 for a building 70 feet long, the cost would be $260 for every ten feet and the length of the building could be limited to the amount of money available and provision made in its construction for an increase in length at a latter date.\n\nIn these estimates there is nothing included that could be considered to be showy or unnecessary and the plans therefore would meet the wishes of the Department on this point.\n\nWith regard .......\nWith regard to the storage of cement we are fortunate in having a warehouse that is well suited for this purpose and there would be no difficulty in storing the quantity we would need.\n\nThe sixteen thousand feet of lumber can be purchased at a mill four miles from the school. It is known as the Fraser Lake Sawmills, Fraser Lake, B.C., and the manager is Mr. M. M. Connelly, M.L.A., the provincial member for the Omineca riding.\n\nI hope that this additional information and suggestions will be sufficient to enable the Department to come to a decision.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"W.

W. Byrne-Grant, C.M.I.\nPrincipal\n\nWBG/HB\nVanderhoof, B.C., February 28th, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to attach hereto a letter with certain recommendations by the Principal of the Lejac Indian Residential School regarding necessary improvements to and additions to the fire fighting equipment at Lejac.\n\nIn commenting on the various points mentioned by the Principal I would respectfully point out that the icy condition of the fire escapes seems to be the worst feature that the successive Principals at the School have had to deal with over a period of years. It was thought that by keeping the snow swept off the fire escapes themselves that we would overcome some of the difficulty but the continual dripping of the roof made the fire escapes next to impossible to use except in case of emergency. However, if the emergency did arise the children could always get down although one or two of them might happen to fall and get hurt; but to use the escapes for fire drill during winter months it is not considered advisable and is not necessary. With reference to the windows which lead unto the fire escapes; these did get sealed up with ice but like the escapes in the case of an emergency the windows would be broken anyway as no one would take time to open them.\n\nNo doubt a similar situation to this must exist in some other schools and I would appreciate information from the Department as to what would be the best procedure to follow during fire drill.\n\nWe did put in some new fire fighting equipment at the School about a year ago but from the information given by the Rev. Principal it would appear as if we should replenish and replace some of the equipment that is faulty and out of condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H.

H. Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nI am enclosing the estimates submitted by Mr. M.M. Connelly, M.L.A. for the lumber required for the new pigsty.\n\nAt first sight the estimate seems to be considerably higher than the item of 15,000 ft of lumber first submitted to the Department but in fact it includes several items listed separately in the original estimate.\n\nIt includes for instance the roofing, I had suggested three ply roofing but I have been informed by the carpenter that roofing will not stand up under the freezing and thawing of our severe winters and is easily torn if snow has to removed from the roof. We have therefore substituted shingles.\n\nIn our first list I had forgotten altogether about doors and windows and this item is found in the enclosed estimates.\n\nMr. Connelly has also included the lumber necessary for the interior fixtures which was listed as a separate item in the original list.\n\nI am today writing to Marshall-Wells to ask them to quote a price for the pipe and drain tile required for the drainage and water fixtures.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. W. Byrne-Grant, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nVanderhoof, B.C., March 1st, 1938\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th ultimo, File No. 163-1-5 with reference to the erection of a piggery at the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply to the last paragraph of your letter I wish to enclose herewith estimates supplied by the Fraser Lake Sawmills Limited, for the lumber and other building material necessary to the construction of the piggery. I am also enclosing herewith a letter from the Rev. Principal which is self explanatory. You will please note that the total estimate amounts to $1127-77.

Principal which I trust you will find self explanatory. I am also enclosing an estimate of the plumbing and water fixtures in connection with the piggery. I thought it advisable to send you this quotation now so that you will be in a better position to know the exact material that is required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnclosures.\nLEJAC INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nUnder direction of the Oblate Fathers\n\nLejac, B.C.\n\nMarch 8th., 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Moore:\n\nWith reference to the estimates for plumbing submitted by Marshall-Wells, the reason for the increase over the original estimate is due to the fact that in my first figures I did not allow for the necessary drain pipe and water pipe to connect the new piggery with the existing water and drainage system.\n\nIt was only when we began to consider the details that I discovered that the building would be 200 feet away from the water and drainage system and that the extra pumping would have to be allowed for.\n\nNow that we have gone into the details, the figures read something like this:\n\n1. Lumber and bricks ......................... $1100-00\n2. Plumbing .................................. 350-00\n3. Gravel and cement .......................... 680-00\n\nTotal $ 2130-00\n\nIf this is more than the Department can see its way to spend, we can fall back on one of the suggestions already made to the Department, viz., to shorten the building, or let the school absorb the difference out of the current revenue, with the possibility of being reimbursed later.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSigned:- W.

The Dept. has already received the estimates for the plumbing as submitted by Marshall-Wells. The amount of sand and gravel is indicated in the original estimates sent to the Dept. It can be brought to the school by C.N.R. freight car or by truck. We usually get it through Mr. Connelly of Fraser Lake Saw Mills to whom the Dept. already gave the contract for the lumber. His price is $3.50 per yard delivered at the school. This would be better for us than to get it by C.N.R. as we would not have to haul it up from the station.\n\nWe have already purchased the brood sows and we shall be in a quandry this winter, if permission to go ahead with the building is not given soon. You know how early our winters come. Would it be possible to hasten action by telegram so that we can get started?

The following supplies were purchased by the Department during the month of March: lumber $1187.77, cement $168.30, with freight charges amounting to $275.70. The Principal's letter to Mr. Phelan dated August 9, 1936, was the first communication received by the Department since March, with respect to the construction of the Lejac pigery. In the absence of any letters, the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch were naturally under the impression that the pig pens had either been completed or were at least in the process of construction. We still find it somewhat difficult to understand why construction work was not started toward the end of March or early in April.\n\nIn a departmental letter dated August 24, the Indian agent was informed that the sum of $500.00 was included in this year's estimates for repairs and improvements at the Lejac school. The agent was informed that this amount could be utilized for the installation -\n\nJ. G. Turgeon, Esq., M.P.,\n124 Pacific Building,\nVancouver,\nB.

It is possible that action has already been taken. If they do not start work on the pig-pen very soon, it will be too late for this year as the cement foundations and the cement floor should be in before any heavy frost occurs.\n\nWould you kindly make enquiries and if definite instructions have not already issued, will you please do what you can to hasten the matter.\n\nWith best personal regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd.)

Cost would be very slight and should not exceed $5.00.\"\n\nMr. Arnall does not state the exact machine to which he refers but no doubt you are aware of this and the repairs recommended by Mr. Arnall should be made at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Since receipt of your letter the Principal's suggestion has been discussed on several occasions with the Engineering Branch. However, it is difficult at this distance to decide whether or not the erection of roofs over the fire escapes would remedy the difficulty that has been experienced. You might review this matter again with the new Principal and if you consider that this work would be a permanent improvement you should let me know the probable cost that would be involved. Possibly if the Department supplied the material the school staff could do the labour. In this event full particulars should be given with regard to material required as, if the cost exceeds $50.00, purchase will have to be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.

Arnall in connection with the machinery at the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nIn the above connection I wish to point out that these repairs have already been attended to by Mr. Leslie, the School Engineer. It was not necessary in this case to have the shaft in question sent out to be turned down.\n\nWhile on the matter of this inspection of Mr. Arnall's I would like to point out that the boiler in the laundry at the School was much too small for all practical purposes, and it was suggested by Mr. Arnall that the size of the boiler which would be suitable would be 18 or 20 horse power, and of the horizontal, tubular, locomotive type. The present boiler is much too small to heat water and work the clothes dryer, whereas if it was the proper size it would carry the clothes dryer as well as being capable of handling a sterilizer, which I think you will agree is a necessity in an institution where children subject to tuberculosis are in attendance, as well as the odd case of trachoma. Please take this matter into consideration at your convenience and advise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI would respectfully refer you to Rev. Father W.

Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Official Letter No.163-1-5 of August the 24th, ultimo with reference to previous correspondence in connection with the construction of a pigery at the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nOwing to the fact that this letter arrived during my absence from the Agency I did not have an opportunity of discussing it with the Rev. principal at the time of its arrival. In doing so since, however, the Rev. Father has agreed to proceed with the construction of the pig pen immediately, having in mind the sum of $500.00 which will be available from the Department to assist in the work. The amount necessary over and above this $500.00 will be put up by the School authorities with the hope that it can be reimbursed to this extent out of the new funds next spring.\n\nI feel that this suggestion by the School Principal is only fair and have no hesitation in recommending that the Department be good enough to agree to this arrangement. In the meantime construction will proceed as rapidly as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.H.

Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 12, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Turgeon:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of August 31, in which you intimate that the Reverend W. Byrne Grant is anxious to proceed with the construction of a piggery at the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nThe records here indicate that the Principal of the Lejac School was authorized to proceed with the construction of a piggery in the early months of this year. The following supplies were purchased by the Department during the month of March: lumber $1127.77, cement $165.30, with freight charges amounting to $273.70. The Principal's letter to Mr. Phelan dated August 9, 1938, was the first communication received by the Department since March, with respect to the construction of the Lejac piggery. In the absence of any letters, the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch were naturally under the impression that the pig pens had either been completed or were at least in the process of construction. We still find it somewhat difficult to understand why construction work was not started toward the end of March or early in April.\n\nIn a departmental letter dated August 24, the Indian agent was informed that the sum of $500.00 was included in this year's estimates for repairs and improvements at the Lejac school. The agent was informed that this amount could be utilized for the installation -\n\nJ. G. Turgeon, Esq., M.P.,\n124 Pacific Building,\nVancouver,\nB. C.\ninstallation of plumbing, etc., at the piggery, but that any additional amount required would have to be provided from school funds. It is altogether likely that the construction of this building has already been started and that the work will be completed prior to the approach of the winter season.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Deputy Minister.\n\nRAH\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant with reference to Mr. Arnall's report regarding the machinery at the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nOur funds at the present time will not permit the purchase of a new boiler. However, I presume that the present boiler will be sufficient for the coming winter and if funds are available next year we will purchase a new boiler.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nR. H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B. C.\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\n\nLEJAC, B.C. October 25th, 1938.\n\nDr. W. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner For B.C.\nP.O. Box 8,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to apply for formal permission to move our two electric generators from the room in the basement, in which they are now located, to a small and separate building behind the main building of the school.\n\nThere are several reasons which prompt this request:\n1. Due to the proximity of the new root cellar to the power room, the exhaust pipe, instead of being in a horizontal position, has to be raised about twelve feet into the air; the resulting back pressure cuts the efficiency of the engines by at least ten per cent, and the engine becomes fouled very quickly.\n2. Due to the position of the exhaust pipe, the silencers cannot be used, and the resulting noise is a great nuisance.\n3. When the generators are running there is a great deal of vibration and noise in the chapel, which is situated directly overhead.\n4. When the generators are removed we will have a good sized room in which to store cordwood for the furnaces. At present this wood has to be stored very close to the fireboxes, thereby causing a serious fire hazard, which was remarked upon by the Inspector on his recent visit.\n\nSince this is a comparatively small undertaking we do not ask any special financial assistance from the Department in order to carry it out; we can do the whole thing by ourselves. The separate building already exists and needs very little alteration to fit it for its new use.\n\nCaptain Barry, who was here last week, heartily endorses this proposal; as also does our engineer, Mr. Leslie.\n\nIn order that we may go ahead with the job, an early reply will be greatly appreciated.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRev. Alex R. Simpson, O.M.I.\n\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nVanderhoof, B.C., October 26th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to attach hereto in duplicate a letter received from the Rev. A.R. Simpson, Acting Principal of the Lejac Indian Residential School, which I trust you will find self explanatory.\n\nAs the proposed change in the location of the two Diesel engines does not entail any expense to this Department and as it is a change that is long over due anyway, I would respectfully request you to authorise the Rev. Principal direct to go ahead and have the change made with as little delay as possible so that it will be completed before the cold weather sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for, B.C.,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nEnclosures.\nOttawa,\nNovember 7, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo regarding removal of two electric generators from the basement of the Lejac Residential School to a small building behind the school.\n\nThe Department concurs in the action you have taken in approving the above change.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:-\n\nI am forwarding herewith a copy of a letter received from Mr. Indian Agent Moore, regarding removal of two electric generators from the basement of the Lejac Indian Residential School to a small building behind the School. A copy of Reverend Father Simpson's letter in connection with the matter is also attached, for your information.\n\nAs Capt. Barry, in his report, recommended that the change suggested be made, and also that same was endorsed by Mr. Moore, and in view of the near approach of cold weather, I authorized the Reverend Principal to proceed to make the change and trust the Department will approve of the action taken.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

The requisitions that you have forwarded amount to $406.20 and the Purchasing Agent is being requested to secure the material.\n\nThis will mean that there will be approximately $343.80 remaining. Owing to the present setup of our appropriation it is impossible to exceed in any fiscal year the amount specifically provided for any residential school.

At present the walls are in bad repair where the plaster has chipped and fallen leaving large patches of bare lath showing.

McGeachy of Vanderhoof for an additional amount for the linoleum he supplied to the Lejac Indian residential school.\n\nIn this regard I may say that Mr. McGeachy has already written to our Purchasing Branch and he was sent the following reply on September 19:\n\n\"I have your letter of the 11th instant, advising us of an error in your quotation and requesting extra payment of an additional $105.00 for the 50 lineal yards of linoleum. To allow you this additional $105.00 would bring your quotation much above that of your competitors and would be unfair to them.\n\n\"Taking all the facts into consideration we are prepared to allow you the difference between the total amount of your tender $241.15 and the next lowest tender, this amounts to $35.10.\n\n\"It will be in order for you to invoice accordingly, quoting our Purchase Order No. 26445.\"\n\nYou will note from the above that the Department offers to allow him an additional amount of $35.10.

McGeachy of Vanderhoof supplied fifty yards of linoleum to the Lejac Indian Residential School. He tendered for this linoleum at $105-00 but claims that he stands to lose $105-00 on the deal as he thought he was tendering for linoleum one yard wide, whereas, the linoleum called for in the tender was two yards wide. I explained to Mr. McGeachy that the tender clearly called for linoleum two yards wide and that the account had already gone forward for payment. I also told him that I did not think that his claim for an additional $105-00 would be favourably considered by the Department. He insisted, however, that I take the matter up with the Department. In this matter I would respectfully refer you to Voucher No. 250 which went forward from this office under date of August 17th, 1939, in favour of Mr. E.C. McGeachy for a total amount of $241-15.

Lacey,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your above mentioned letter of the 28th ultimo. I have received authority from the Department since the receipt of your letter to have a competent local contractor give a price on the erection of a new chimney and wire them at once. Mr. A.F. Andersen went to the School yesterday and looked the situation over and then returned to Prince George to make his estimate on the cost. I have just received his estimate by wire and have now sent the information on to the Department at Ottawa by wire copy of which is attached. I believe Mr. Andersen's estimate to be the best possible to obtain and if he does the job it will be done right. What he means by \"both chimneys must be built at the same time\" is that he will first construct the new chimney and it will take care of both boilers until he takes the old chimney down and constructs another new one in its place. Inspector Barry has explained why this is necessary in his report. The Rev. Principal has also recommended the same procedure in his report which I am returning herewith. If Mr. Andersen only build one chimney and then had to return at another time with his men to build the second one he would of course have to charge more for the work.\n\nTrusting that this report is satisfactory,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJas. H.F. Lacey,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for, B.C.,\nBox 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOctober 13, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing receipt of report from Acting Agent Lacey on the fire which recently occurred at Le Jac Indian Residential School, I immediately instructed him to obtain an estimate of costs involved in rebuilding the existing chimney and the construction of a new chimney. I informed Mr. Lacey that Mr. H. P. Anderson of Prince George was fully competent to make the necessary survey and give an estimate of costs.\n\nI understand that Mr. Lacey has submitted the necessary information direct to the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nVanderhoof, B.C., Oct. 5th, 1939.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT ON STUART LAKE AGENCY FOR SEPTEMBER.\n\nOn the 25th of the month I investigated a fire at the Lejac Indian school in company with Constable Rae. I made a special report on this fire and have also submitted a report by the school principal. The Inspector of Indian school was at the Institution at the time of the fire and he has also made a full report of the occurrence to the department. Early steps will be taken to see what can be done to remedy the fire hazard.\n\nJ.H.F. Lacey,\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 11, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Lejac Indian Residential School,\nElectoral District of Cariboo,\nStuart Lake Indian Agency,\nProvince of British Columbia.\n\nThere was a fire on September 24 at the above-mentioned school due to a defective chimney but no heavy damage was done. Reporting on this fire the Principal wrote as follows:\n\n\"Once more I am obliged to send you a report of a fire having broken out in this school. The cause is substantially the same as that which caused the fire reported in my letter to the Department on December 19th., 1938, namely the high-pressure boiler for the laundry.\n\n\"After the previous fire I moved this boiler to another location, and piped it into the flue intended for the hot water heater and the bakery ovens. But this additional load has proved to be too much for the chimney and it overheated, cracked in many places, and had already charred the roof and the shingles when it was discovered. The house became filled with smoke that escaped through the cracks and holes in the chimney this morning, during the washing, and when we investigated we discovered the above mentioned condition.\n\n\"The chimney is built of home made brick, made of the local clay, and is not suitable for standing the heat from the fires. It is our opinion that the only\n\"permanent solution for the removal of this fire hazard is to tear down the whole chimney and rebuild it with high quality bricks. Also, a separate chimney should be erected on the other side of the building for the high pressure boiler and the hot water heater recommended by the Inspector of Schools.\"\n\nThe Indian Agent was requested by wire to advise the cost of erecting two new chimneys at this school. On the recommendation of Commissioner MacKay he secured the services of a competent contractor, Mr. A.P. Andersen, who has quoted as follows:\n\n1. New chimney 18 x 18 flue with 8\" wall lined with firebrick -- 60' high .................. $1,080.00\n\n2. Tear down old chimney and rebuild 12 x 12 flue to be lined with ordinary flue lining ...... $580.00\n\nThe above quotations have been supplied on the understanding that both chimneys will be built at the same time and the prices include concrete foundations for the chimneys.\n\nThe Lejac residential school was constructed in the fiscal year 1921-22 at an approximate cost of $185,000.00. In view of the two fires that have occurred as a result of the defective chimney it is considered that it would be advisable to erect two new chimneys immediately. The officers of the Surveys & Engineering Branch were consulted this morning and they expressed the opinion that the prices quoted by Mr. Andersen are reasonable.\n\nFunds for the erection of the chimneys can be provided from the appropriation for the current fiscal year and I should appreciate receiving the approval of the Minister to accept Mr. Andersen's tender for the immediate construction of these two chimneys.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The cause is substantially the same as that which caused the fire reported in my letter to the Department on December 19th, 1935, namely the high-pressure boiler for the laundry.\n\nAfter the previous fire I moved this boiler to another location, and piped it into the flue intended for the hot water heater and the bakery ovens. But this additional load has proved to be too much for the chimney and is overcrowded and cracked in many places, and had already damaged the roof and the stables when it was discovered. The house became filled with smoke that escaped through the cracks and holes in the chimney this morning, during the washing, and when we investigated we discovered the above mentioned condition.\n\nThe Inspector of Schools, Captain Barry, was here at the time and was a witness of the whole affair; which I am sure he will describe at length in his report.\n\nThe chimney is built of homemade brick, made of the local clay, and is not suitable for standing the heat from the fires. It is our opinion that the only permanent solution for the removal of this fire hazard is to tear down the whole chimney and rebuild it with high quality bricks. Also, a separate chimney should be erected on the other side of the building for the high pressure boiler and the hot water heater recommended by the Inspector of Schools.\n\nFor the present, however, in order that we may carry on, we will make temporary repairs with cement wherever possible. Inside the attic, for example, we found less than thirteen holes in the brickwork of the chimney, these can be stopped up, for the present, with cement. But, until this matter is remedied, it will be a constant source of danger to the building; and an anxiety to us.\n\nTherefore, I beg that you will give this matter your prompt attention. I would suggest that a competent person be sent here to make a first hand investigation of the situation; and make suggestions that will entirely remove any danger of a third, or perhaps more serious, fire from the same source.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSigned: Rev.

The following is a report of the condition of the system. This report includes general information pertaining to the septic tank, a description of the condition of system at the time of inspection and suggested alterations. A detailed estimated cost of the proposed alterations is appended.\n\nGENERAL\n\nThe Lejac School, built in 1920-21, is situated on the south side of Fraser Lake, a few hundred yards from the C.N.Railway track. The school is of considerable size and this year there are about 200 persons in residence, including students and staff. Water for the institution is obtained from Fraser Lake.\n\nAccording to the school caretaker, approximately 3500 gals. are used in the school during an average day. A large percentage of this water is used for baths and for the flush toilets. There are approximately 20 flush toilets, 6 baths and 6 showers located in various parts of the building. On Saturdays, bath day at the school, 600 gals. of water are used in a period of 4 hours.\n\nWaste water from the kitchen passes through a grease trap before reaching the septic tank. An inspection showed that the trap was working satisfactorily.\n\nC.E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer\nDominion Water & Power Bureau,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nThe following disinfectants are used:\nLysol for disinfecting baths and sinks, chloride of lime for cleaning sinks and toilets and drain cleaner elsewhere.\n\nSeveral years ago a bunkhouse was built for the farm and school workmen. This building is situated about a hundred yards west of the school. Approximately 10 years ago two flush toilets were installed and a four inch sewer laid from the bunkhouse to a point 180 feet from the school septic tank.\n\nCONDITIONS AS FOUND ON DECEMBER 22, 1939.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe condition of the sewage disposal system of the school is not satisfactory. The filter bed is not operating and the effluent flows over the surface of the ground. Although the septic tank is functioning fairly well it can be improved. No objectionable odor was noticed in the vicinity of the septic tank at the time of inspection. Raw sewage from the bunkhouse is deposited on the ground within 250 feet of the school. Following is detailed description of the condition of the system and suggested improvements.\n\nSEPTIC TANK AND FILTER BED\n\nThe capacity of the septic tank is rather small for an institution housing 200 people. However, the tank will operate satisfactorily if it receives reasonable attention.\n\nAt the time of inspection the septic tank was in an unsatisfactory condition. This condition was due partly to the need of cleaning. According to the school caretaker it was cleaned in July, 1938, seventeen months ago, which under normal conditions may\nnot be too long a period. Under the circumstances this is too long an interval and in the future it would be advisable to clean the tank more frequently.\n\nThe installation of a distribution gallery and baffle suggested later in the report, will improve the action of the tank and may lengthen the interval between cleanings.\n\nMeasurements were made of the thickness of scum and depth of sludge. There were two feet of scum on top and about three feet of sludge at the bottom of the tank. The sludge was in a well decayed condition and of good color.\n\nAn inspection showed the effluent compartment to be fairly clean and the effluent clear.\n\nFor the past six years the Miller syphon in the effluent compartment has not been operating and last year it was removed. The outlet was plugged with cement and now the effluent passes through the overflow pipe. The present state of the tank is shown on the attached whiteprint.\n\nThe filter bed has not been functioning for the past six years. Effluent runs from the tank to the distribution chamber at the head of the filter bed and then flows over the surface of the ground.\n\nSEWAGE FROM THE BUNKHOUSE\n\nThere are two flush toilets in the bunkhouse. Sewage from them is carried in a 4\" pipe and deposited on the ground at a point approximately 180 feet from the septic tank. This highly unsanitary condition has existed for the past ten years. The location of the sewer from the bunkhouse is shown on the attached whiteprint.\nCHANGES IN SYSTEM\n\nThe following changes have been made in the system since it was installed:\n\n1. Removal of Miller syphon last year.\n2. Filter bed no longer operating.\n3. Formerly the waste from the laundry passed through the septic tank but last year the pipe from the laundry was connected to the boiler blowdown pipe and laundry wastes no longer go through the tank. As 2500 gallons of water are used in the laundry over Monday this change should improve the action of the septic tank.\n\nSUGGESTED ALTERATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS\n\n1. Sewage from the bunkhouse should either be carried to the school septic tank or treated in a separate tank. Owing to the long distance from the bunkhouse to the school tank it would be advisable to install a small septic tank adjacent to the bunkhouse even though the cost is slightly greater. The effluent may be carried to the proposed drain from the school septic tank by extending the present 4\" sewer a hundred feet. The proposed extension of the drain is shown on the attached blueprint. A detailed drawing of the proposed septic tank is appended.\n\n2. Install a distribution gallery and baffle board in lieu of present inlet to the school septic tank. This would reduce the inlet velocity and consequently there would be less disturbance of the sludge during periods of heavy flow. The action of the septic tank would be improved by the proposed distribution gallery.\n\n3. Replace the manhole over the sludge compartment with a cleanout opening the full width of the tank. If the proposed distribution gallery is installed the existing manhole will have to be moved.\nRather than build the same size manhole a larger opening would be advisable. With the larger opening the tank could be cleaned more easily. A detailed drawing of the proposed distribution gallery and cleanout opening is appended.\n\n4. At the present time the effluent from the septic tank is running over the surface of the ground. This condition could be remedied by reconditioning the filter bed and replacing the Miller syphon. If this policy were followed the system would operate satisfactorily until such time as the filter required further attention. Cleaning a filter 75 ft. x 50 ft. every few years would be expensive and consequently it may be advisable to dispose of the effluent by other means.\n\nProposed method of disposing of effluent:\n\nLay a 4\" vitrified pipe from the existing 6\" effluent drainpipe to a point about 500 feet away. The 4\" drain should have about 4 feet of cover. (The location of this pipe is shown on the attached whiteprint). From the end of the drain the effluent would be carried in a shallow trench and distributed over a ploughed area. Two acres would be a large enough area. It would be advisable to build a fence around the ploughed area to prevent the school children from coming in contact with the contaminated soil. The effluent should be distributed over one part of this field for a few months and then over another part. The proposed disposal field would be entirely satisfactory and would not cause any objectionable nuisance.\nThe only attention required would be blocking off the distribution ditch every few months to allow the effluent to run over a new area and ploughing the field every year.\n\n5. Large quantities of disinfectant hinder the action of the tank. The school authorities should be requested to use disinfectant in weak solutions which are quite effective.\n\nThe suggested alterations can be made at an estimated cost of $884.00. A detailed estimate of the proposed alterations is appended.\n\nIf the proposed alterations are made it would be advisable to do the work during the month of May or during the period September 1st to October 15th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWOM Donald\n\nList of photographs - taken on December 22, 1939.\n1.

Later we arranged with the Surveys & Engineering Branch to have one of their officers visit the school and he reports that certain work is necessary at an estimated cost of $884.00. We are, therefore, instructing the Surveys & Engineering Branch to proceed with this work and this expenditure will exhaust practically all the funds provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school.\n\nWe have also included an item of $750.00 for a high pressure steam boiler. Possibly some other equipment is more necessary. In any case you should consult the Principal and let me have your recommendation regarding what should be supplied. Detailed information should be given in connection with any equipment in order that the matter may be handled by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nAs you state in the last paragraph of your letter it is necessary for all officials to keep expenditures as low as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. Robt.

McDonald, of our engineering staff at Vancouver, following an inspection he made of septic tank facilities on December 22nd last. Mr. McDonald's report contains photographs and a sketch plan.\n\nHis recommendations have been concurred in by our Chief Engineer, and are also approved by the undersigned. His recommendations might be summarized as follows:\n\n(1) While the septic tank for the school is small, it will operate satisfactorily if given reasonable attention, and if the filter bed is put in proper condition.\n\n(2) Local conditions make possible the construction of a small septic tank adjacent to the bunkhouse which can be connected to a disposal pipeline which will carry the effluent from the school septic tank as well. The disposal area would be divided in two lots which would be used alternatively.\n\nOur Chief District Engineer at Vancouver, Mr. Webb, also approves of Mr. McDonald's recommendations.\nThe estimated cost of the work is $884.00, and should be given consideration in the estimates for 1940-41.\n\nThe work should be done during the month of May or early in the fall. In the latter case it should be commenced not later than September 1st.\n\nDirector.\n| Date       | Description                                                                 | Amount   |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| July 31    | To 1 only 15 H.P.

WARREN\n\nLejac, B.C.,\nAugust 17, 1940\nLejac, B.C.,\nAugust 17, 1940.\n\nSir:\n\nWhile carrying out work on the sewage system of the Lejac Indian School, which was completed on the above date and left in good order, I took occasion to inspect the other services at the school and in this connection I wish to report as follows.\n\nWater Supply\n\nWater is obtained from Fraser Lake, situated about 1 mile from the school. The water is good and the supply abundant. The supply is pumped to an elevated tank situated about 2 miles from the lake and about 1000 feet from the school, through a 4 inch wood stave pipe. Originally the installation was made with 2 pneumatic tanks, 1500 gallons normal capacity, situated in the basement of the school, probably about 1923, but was altered to the elevated tank at a later date, pressure about 40 pounds static.\n\nThe pumping plant consists of 2 Fairbanks Morse horizontal type double acting 3\" x 6\" stroke pumps, #116995 and #99463 - belt connected to each side of Fairbanks Morse, 10 H.P., 350 RPM \"Z\" type horizontal gas engine C26287, pulleys 16\" long to 23\" pump. Plant will deliver 100 U.S. g.p.m. against 100 lbs. pressure. Pump house is frame building on concrete foundation over concrete well - 15 feet deep and on bedrock, into which a 6 foot pipe line leads from the lake.\n\nC. E. Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nThe intake is situated at a distance of about 350 feet from pump house and lake depth at intake was 9 inches on August 15th. Normally the pipe line extends about 300 feet into the lake. There is a screen on the intake. A wooden settling box, 5 feet by 20 feet, is situated on the intake line a short distance from the pump house, to interrupt the flow of sand into the well by wave action. Pumping is not done when the wind is blowing if sufficient supply can be maintained. It is necessary to heat the pump house in winter. This is done by means of a stove.\n\nIt was noted that the gear covers on the pumps were missing. These should be replaced to guard against accidents. It was also noted that hold down bolts on one pump had no nuts, and that one bearing on #95465 pump had a broken housing cover, also that the crank guard on the engine was missing. This should be replaced.\n\nStorage Tank\n\nWooden storage tank, 20000 gallons capacity, built on wooden tower about 20 feet high, all enclosed in frame building, provided with stove for heating in winter. Tank building appears to be in good condition, no leaks evident. Ashes are allowed to accumulate around the wooden pedestals supporting the tank and the walls of the building. These should be removed to prevent decay.\n\nFire Protection System\n\n3 outside fire hydrants and about 200 feet of 2 inch cotton rubberlined hose on a reel. Inside hydrants and hose, also hand bomb fire extinguishers.\nAll appear to be kept in fair order. Iron fire escapes appear to be in good order - said to be dangerous due to ice and snow in winter.\n\n**Heating System**\n\nThis is said to be operating satisfactorily. Wood fuel used. There is thought to be a leak in return line to boilers under concrete floors, possibly due to corrosion. This probably needs replacement as shows no signs of replacement in approximately 20 years school has been built.\n\n**Electric Light Plant**\n\nConsists of 1 - 6 horsepower and 1 - 9 horsepower Lister oil engine generator plant. Connected for individual or multiple operation, with switchboard. Appear to be in good operating condition.\n\n**Laundry Machinery**\n\nThe laundry machinery consisting of a horizontal barrel washer and an extractor appear to be operating satisfactorily. A new 15 horsepower steam boiler was being installed at the time of my visit.\n\n**Refrigeration Plant**\n\nThis plant was not in operating condition at the time of my visit although work was being carried out to put it in operating condition in part. It consists of 1 ton ammonia plant with 2 cooling chambers. Congealing tank and coils of larger chamber in bad condition. Leaks were evident in the high pressure circuit as well. There should not be the necessity for a plant of this nature at Lejac as there is always an abundance of ice.\nin Fraser lake about \u00bd mile from the school which, with adequate storage capacity, should provide for all cooling requirements of the school probably at less cost than for artificial cooling.\n\nThe school building appears to be in good condition and reasonably well maintained. Outside painting will probably be necessary within the next two years.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.C. Warren\nOttawa,\nOctober 9, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Principal last July and may say that I concur fully with their views in this regard.\n\nThe old ammonia plant is not in working order and the cost of repairs and maintenance is excessive therefore would recommend the present plant be replaced with an ice house. Construction has commenced on the foundation of the ice house as it is desirable to pour concrete before frosty weather.\n\nThe building will be of frame construction 12'x20'x18' outside and 11'x18'x18' inside inside lined with asbestos felt and walls and ceiling filled with shavings, concrete foundation and floors with shingled roof. Total cost approximately $400.00. I understand, however, that the Rev.

It is noted that you recommend the abandonment of the present ammonia plant and the construction of a new ice house.\n\nThe Department will allow an amount of $250.00 toward the cost of the items. It is presumed that this amount will be spent in the purchase of materials and you should issue the necessary purchase order for what is purchased and attach same to your voucher.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn his report dated August 17, 1940, on the Lejac Indian Residential School, Mr. W. C. Warren of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau made the following comment on the refrigeration plant:\n\n\"This plant was not in operating condition at the time of my visit although work was being carried out to put it in operating condition in part. It consists of one ton ammonia plant with two cooling chambers. Congealing tank and coils of larger chamber in bad condition. Leaks were evident in the high pressure circuit as well. There should not be the necessity for a plant of this nature at Lejac as there is always an abundance of ice in Fraser Lake about one-quarter mile from the school which, with adequate storage capacity, should provide for all cooling requirements of the school probably at less cost than for artificial cooling.\"\n\nThe abandonment of the existing ammonia plant and its replacement by an ice house with adequate storage capacity was discussed a short time ago with Rev. Father Simpson, Principal of Lejac School, when he called at this office. Ammonia plants are not generally regarded as satisfactory nowadays and it is highly doubtful if the Department would be justified in making any large outlay in putting the existing plant in shape in view of the opportunity to secure the service required by the erection of a non-expensive ice house and storage of ice from Fraser Lake.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIt is...\nIt is estimated that the costs of the proposed ice house would be $400. Of this amount the Department is asked to provide $250, the balance to be furnished by the school.\n\nI would recommend that the existing plant be abandoned and that the Department assist in the construction of an ice house to the extent of $250.00.\n\nA copy of a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Howe relating to the matter is enclosed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Howe, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Howe:\n\nI wish to make formal report of a fire which occurred here last night. About ten-thirty one of the farm help discovered that the chicken house was on fire and gave the alarm. The fire had already taken firm hold of the west end of the chicken house, and our efforts had to be confined to trying to save as much of the remainder as possible.\n\nAbout two thirds of the building was totally destroyed. The third section of the building was slightly damaged. We had been preparing the buildings in order to put the chickens inside for the winter and had started a fire in the stove to dry out the interior of the chicken house. Somehow, we cannot determine exactly just how it happened, the roof caught fire and the blaze spread very rapidly, despite all of our efforts to check it.\n\nOur estimate of the damage is about $1200.00 for the buildings, and about $350.00 for equipment. The chickens were still on summer range, so none of them were lost. Rebuilding will have to be done immediately, so as to provide shelter for our 1100 birds before freeze-up.\n\nThis represents quite a serious loss for the school. We have found chicken and egg producing to be quite profitable, and of great assistance to the school. Will you kindly bring this matter to the attention of the department at once; and earnestly request that we might obtain some assistance in making good the loss that we have suffered through this unfortunate fire?\n\nThanking you for your valued cooperation in this matter,\n\nI remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nRev.

Attached hereto is a report from the Rev. Principal covering the fire.\n\nAccording to my investigation the fire started about 10-30 P.M. on the 17th. The alarm was sounded immediately and a fire hose from the nearest hydrant brought into action. Apparently a strong wind was blowing and they were only able to save a part of the section. The other two sections were totally destroyed. The cause of the fire is difficult to determine. There is no doubt it originated from the stove which had been lighted to air the house ready for transfer of the chickens from the summer pens to winter quarters. The stove is encased in cement with an iron firebox door and about three lengths of 6\" stove pipe to brick chimney. It is quite possible the fire started from a loose stove pipe connection or the fire box door may have been carelessly left ajar.\n\nThe building destroyed measured 120' X 30' X 8' built in three sections 40 feet to a section of frame construction, double sheeting with sawdust filling, Ruberoid roofing and concrete foundation which is undamaged.\n\nThere is no other building available to house the chickens for the winter. It is therefore necessary to rebuild immediately. The damage is estimated at $1550-00. This sum includes $350-00 for loss of equipment, brooders, incubators, troughs, etc.\n\nThe Rev. Principal earnestly requests some financial assistance from the Department to make good the loss. No definite amount is stated in his letter but would recommend that an amount equivalent to half the damage sustained be granted for rebuilding purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Copies of letters from Reverend Father Simpson and Inspector Larry relative to the matter are attached.\n\nReverend Father Byrne-Grant was greatly interested in poultry raising and it was under his Principalship that the school went into the business on a fairly large scale. I am under the impression that the cost of the buildings, extensions and equipment was met from school funds.\n\nIt would appear from Principal Simpson's letter that the business was quite profitable.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I consider the school should be required to meet the costs of replacement without Departmental assistance.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

As stated in my letter of October 28, 1941, an amount of $1000.00 has been included in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school. At the time the estimates were prepared the amount stated was included as we were informed by the Agent that the roof required considerable repairs. However, in view of your letter it now appears that the providing of new tubes is very urgent. On referring to your letter of October 22, 1941, it is noted that you estimate the cost of the tubes at $700.00. It will be necessary to make this purchase through our Purchasing Branch and consequently you should forward detailed information regarding the size and type of tubes required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6444, file 881-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith requisition for a proposed expenditure of $1985-00 for much needed repairs to the exterior of Lejac Indian Residential School Block. The repairs considered necessary are itemised on the requisition.\n\nThe roof and exterior of the School has not been painted since construction over 20 years ago. Quite a number of the shingles are rotted and curled up. The outside casings, eaves troughs and drain pipes are badly weathered and practically devoid of paint. Mr. Engineer Warren of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau in the last paragraph of his report dated August 17th, 1940 mentions that the repairs in question should be undertaken within the space of two years.\n\nAttached hereto a tender from Mr. P.A. Andersen, General Contractor, Prince George, B.C., who, as far as I can ascertain is the only Contractor in the District equipped and capable of handling this class of work. Mr. Andersen built the chimneys at the School in 1939 and other buildings in previous years. His services were considered very satisfactory.\n\nIncluded in the tender are two alternatives, 1st. one coat of paint on casings, roof, and shingle replacements at a cost of $190-00. 2nd. shingle replacements and two coats of stain on roof only $765-00. In the opinion of Mr. Andersen and the writer the first alternative should be ruled out completely. A single coat of paint on the roof and casings in its present condition would be ineffective.\n\nHowever, if the amount $1985-00 for shingle replacements and two coats of paint throughout is not available it is recommended that the second alternative be accepted for repairs to roof only. This is considered urgent, as yet no leaks have been noted, but unless repairs to the roof are carried out soon leakages can be expected. You will note from a letter attached to the requisition that Mr. Andersen will probably be able to do the job, but due to the scarcity of labour and circumstances beyond his control would not care to guarantee it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosures.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the current year's appropriation an amount of $1000.00 was provided for repairs, improvements and new equipment for this school. We have already authorized an expenditure of $424.70 for boiler tubes. This leaves less than $600.00 still available in the amount specifically provided for Lejac. However, we have a small unallotted amount in our appropriation and we can handle the expenditure of $765.00 which, it is noted from Indian Agent Howe's letter, will repair the roof and allow for two coats of stain.

Vancouver.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, it is difficult for me to see how we can do other than proceed with these repairs. I should point out, however, that there is an amount of $1,000 for repairs and equipment at the Lejac School in the estimates of this year. We have already expended $1,200, so that it is difficult for me to discover a source from which this repair bill can be paid. Such repairs, of course, are a necessity and are inevitable in the very nature of things. It would be appreciated by the officials here, however, if we could get, prior to the preparation of our estimates each year, a fairly accurate estimate of the amounts needed for such repairs at our schools. It so happens that this year the cost of repair work at practically all our schools is in excess of the amounts provided.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.

Equipment Company dated the 3rd instant, from which it will be observed that the cost of this work will amount to $235.00, f.o.b. Vancouver.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would kindly confirm by airmail your approval of this expenditure.\n\nIt has been found that the work of the Company has been very satisfactory and I consider the engine worth the expenditure.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

MacKay,\nRE: Lejac Indian School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease refer to your favor of July 28th, file 215-13-9514, on the subject of inspection of the 5 H.P. Lister Engine which was sent in from the above school.\n\nWe have now received a report from our Diesel Mechanic, who has dismantled this engine completely, and we are able to give below, an estimate on the cost of re-fitting.\n\nWe are glad to report that the crankshaft, and main bearings appear to be in good shape, as we cannot detect any deflection, so that it would appear to be profitable to rebuild the engine.\n\nThe cylinder head has a crack along side one of the valve seats, and the cost of replacing this head is $60.00.\n\nAnother large item is the reboring of the cylinder and fitting an oversize piston, and it will be necessary to make a pattern for the piston. After these repairs are completed, the engine could be expected to give satisfactory operation for a number of years.\n\nWe would quote as follows:\n\nOverhauling and refitting 5 H.P. Diesel Engine, supplying new head, reboring cylinder and making and fitting new piston, complete with rings; overhauling fuel pump and atomizer; making and fitting new flywheel keys; repairing governor, building up and replacing parts on same; supplying new gaskets, assembling and testing on the load -\n\nP.T.O.\nOttawa,\nJuly 21, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, an accountable cheque for $64.00 will be forwarded to Indian Agent Howe to cover the cost of the labour in installing the new tubes in the boiler at the Lejac Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your second letter of the 15th instant, authority is granted for shipment of the Lister engine and generator from the Lejac School to Vancouver in order to have it overhauled. Please keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

Lister Engine and generator, is in bad shape and needs immediate repairs.\n\nThe main shaft is bent, and the cylinder needs to be honed out and fitted with new piston. I would suggest that this engine be sent down to Hoffars in Vancouver and given a complete overhaul.\n\nThis work should be considered in the nature of emergency repairs, and should be done as soon as possible. For a great deal of our work we use only this small engine, and while it is out of commission we shall have to use the larger one, thereby consuming quite a lot more diesel fuel than would otherwise be necessary.\n\nTherefore, will you please take the necessary steps to have this work authorised as soon as possible by the Indian Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Alex. R. Simpson, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nDear Sir:-\n\nI would refer to your letter of May 18th, file 163-1-5 with reference to retubing the boiler at the Le Jac Indian Residential School the cost of the material for which amounted to $475.02 including freight and cartage and, to advise that it has now been found that the school Engineer does not possess the necessary equipment or experience to install these tubes, in consequence of which Mr. Indian Agent Howe has requisitioned, as per the attached letter of the 8th instant, for the work to be done by Mr. J. Leslie, at a cost of $64.00.\n\nIt would be appreciated if this additional outlay could be authorized.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor: D. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the installation of 74 boiler tubes for use in boiler No. 22460 #2 right hand at the Lejac Indian Residential School, the Rev. Principal now advises that Mr. Leslie, the Engineer at the School has neither the experience nor the equipment to install boiler tubes and that it is necessary to employ an experienced man for this work.\n\nIt is suggested that Mr. J. Leslie, Engineer at the Fraser Lake Mills and son of the Engineer at the School be engaged. Mr. Leslie Jr. advises that he has the necessary equipment and experience to install boiler tubes. Mr. Mark Connelly his employer also advises that this Engineer is quite capable of doing the work.\n\nIt is anticipated it will take about eight days to install the tubes at a daily rate of $8.00, $1.00 per hour. Total expenses $64.00. Experienced men for this type of work are extremely scarce and I think we would be well advised to employ Mr. Leslie.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRobert Howe,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRH/L.\n\nMajor D.M.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa,\nMay 28, 1943.\n\nMr. R. Howe, Indian Agent, Vanderhoof, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, addressed to Indian Commissioner MacKay, the Department approves an expenditure of $92.50 for labour in removing the old tubes and installing new ones in boiler No. 22461 at the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for, B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThe Rev. Principal of the Lejas Indian Residential School reported on the 27th inst. that the sewage disposal system at the School is out of order and that immediate repairs are necessary. It was also reported that underpinnings supporting the water tank are rotten and should be replaced.\n\nI inspected the sewage system yesterday and it would appear the field pipe from the cesspool is broken, probably at several points, causing a leakage in two places about 150 yards from the School building. The stench is horrible and certainly not sanitary.\n\nThe 12\" X 12\" underpinnings supporting the water tower are quite decayed at the ends and should be either spliced or replaced altogether. The tank holds a heavy load of water and is liable to collapse if repairs are not done in the near future.\n\nMr. Engineer Warren of the Dominion Water Power Branch repaired the sewage system at the School three years ago and I would suggest he be sent to Lejas as soon as possible to inspect and report on the system and the water tower.\n\nAt the same time I would like to have a report on necessary repairs to the foundation of the girls' playroom in the main school building. This item was included in the estimates for the current year.\n\nR. Howe,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter received from Mr. Indian Agent Howe wherein he requests that an examination be made of the sewage disposal system at the Lejac Indian Residential School by the Vancouver division of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, and also that a report be made on the repairs required to the foundation of the girls' playroom in the main building at the same time. It would appear that these matters require immediate attention and I would recommend that same be referred to the Surveys and Engineering Branch for investigation and report.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa,\nJune 4, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, enclosing copy of letter received from Indian Agent Howe. I am bringing the contents of this letter to the attention of the Surveys & Engineering Branch, as it is evident that the sewage disposal system and the underpinning supporting the water tower will have to receive immediate attention. For your information I may say that in the current year's appropriation an amount of $875.00 was provided for repairs, improvements and purchase of new material at this school. We have already either authorized or expended the following amounts:\n\n1. Repairs to Lister engine ...........$ 66.55\n2. Purchase of new boiler tubes ......... 615.76\n3. Taking out old tubes and installing new tubes .................................. 92.50\n\nYou will note from the above that the amount specifically provided for this school has practically been expended. We are only allowed a very small amount for unforeseen expenditures and consequently it is only possible to do the most urgent work this year.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJune 4, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Lejeu Indian Residential School\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter from the Indian Agent regarding the above-mentioned school.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would arrange to have one of your staff visit this school at an early date with reference to the sewage disposal system and the underpinning supporting the water tank.\n\nThe funds at our disposal are limited and consequently, if it is cheaper to splice the underpinning and if your officer feels that this would be satisfactory, I suggest that the replacement of the underpinning be deferred to a later date. As soon as your officer visits the school I would appreciate having his report.\n\nDirector.\nPRINCE GEORGE, B.C.\n\nMay 26th 1943\n\nR.

Regarding the water tank supports Mr. Warren considers that they should be repaired at once and that as labour is very scarce in the locality, the work should be done by a local contractor in accordance with specifications to be prepared by him. We concur in this and suggest that the Indian Affairs Branch be advised so that arrangements may be made to provide the $500.00 which will be required.\n\nJ. M.

In this connection I wish to report as follows:\n\n**Sewage System:**\nThe system has been thoroughly cleaned and is now working satisfactorily. The Rev. Principal has been instructed to clean the system at intervals of not more than two years, as recommended by Mr. Warren.\n\n**Basement wall, girls playroom:**\nThe repairs to the basement wall and the grading recommended will be carried out as soon as possible by the school staff.\n\n**Water tank foundations:**\nIt is noted Mr. Warren recommends that repairs to the water tower foundation should be carried out in July, at an approximate cost of $500.00. It is suggested that tenders be obtained from local contractors for this work.\n\nOn receipt of the specifications tenders may be obtained from Mr. S. W. Cocker, Vanderhoof, B.C., and Mr. O. J.

The Indian Agent reports that the work has been well done and he considers the account very reasonable. It would, therefore, be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid. The coding is as follows: 881-76-10-591.\n\nR.A.

Telford, Fraser Lake, B.C., for cutting out old tubes and replacing new tubes in the boiler at Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Telford's tender and the authority granted was for $92-50 for completion of this work. However, as Mr. Telford points out in the attached letter unforeseen difficulties were encountered and the work took twice as long as formerly anticipated.\n\nTaking the hours of work expended by Mr. Telford installing the tubes his wages are very low indeed. I would strongly recommend that the account be paid in full.\n\nI might add that failing to obtain Mr. Telford's services it would have been necessary to send to Vancouver for a mechanic at double the present cost.\n\nRH/L.\n\nEnclos.\n\nR.

When you obtain the quotations they should be submitted to Indian Commissioner MacKay for his decision regarding what firm is to do the work.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Lejac (Fraser Lake)\nIndian Residential School.\n\nIn accordance with your notation dated the 22nd instant on a copy of a memorandum to you dated the 20th idem from Dr. McGill, Director of the Indian Affairs Branch, I am enclosing herewith, specifications and blueprint, covering the repairs to the water tank supports of the above school.\n\nIt would appear that this method of repair, if carried out in accordance with these specifications, will be satisfactory.\n\nKne.\n\nJ.

However, before obtaining the quotations he is awaiting the specifications and, as the summer is advancing, it would be appreciated if the latter could be forwarded to me at an early date.\n\nDirector.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI would refer to your letter of the 2nd instant file 163-1-5 regarding repairs to the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection, I enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Howe's letter of the 8th instant advising that the sewage system is now working satisfactorily after being cleaned in accordance with Mr. Warren's instructions. Mr. Howe also advises that repairs to the basement wall and the grading will be carried out by the school staff as soon as possible.\n\nIn connection with required repairs to the water tower foundation at a cost of about $500.00, it is suggested that tenders be obtained from local contractors as soon as specifications are available.\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Aug. 28 | Lejac Indian Residential School: To taking out 74 boiler tubes and installing 74 new tubes in boiler at Lejac Indian Residential School.

Howe,\nIndian Agent.\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nNovember 13, 1943.\n\nMr. Robert Howe,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to our conversation re your Department seeking a detailed statement of extra costs for work done at LeJac Indian School water tower I now submit the following:\n\n| Item                          | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| Extra Bolts & Washers         | $16.00 |\n| Trips to Vanderhoof for same  | $16.80 |\n| @ $.10 per mile               |        |\n| hrs. labour @ $1.00 and $1.25 | $54.00 |\n| per hour                      |        |\n| Supervision fee               | $10.00 |\n\n$96.80\n\nIf there is to be further unnecessary delay in payment of the above extra costs would you please have your Department issue a separate voucher for the original contract price of $460.00 as I have already paid all labour charges and other bills in connection with this job. Then the $55.00 extra charge could by your officials be considered later.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nS.W. Cocker.\nVanderhoof, B.C.,\nNov. 1, 1943.\n\nRobert Howe Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to our conversation re your Department wishing a detailed statement of my extra costs in connection with job at LeJac Indian School, I would first state that the sum of $460, my original tender was not a liberal amount for that work.\n\nI did inspect the work in a general way before pricing the job, more particularly with respect to suitable gravel and dry jackpine poles for false work etc. From the look of the country one would expect to get eighteen poles twenty feet long in that district, but found I had to haul them a distance of twenty-five miles. The gravel at the beach looked o.k., but upon closer examination found it too dirty for cement work, so had to cut out an old gravel road some ten miles away.\n\nThe additional cost, as explained in my last letter, was caused by the extra bolts, both top and bottom. The bottom, because of the small space to work in, and the top caused additional staging, for the reason that I could not swing the braces as I had figured, but had to take the entire brace off.\n\nI naturally figured the job from the plan and specification.\n\nI had to make two trips to Vanderhoof with a truck (the only unit I had on the job) to get the extra bolts.\n\nThe shortage of labor was an important factor in the additional costs. I paid three carpenters $1.25 per hour to do this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"S. W. Cocker.\"\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nEngineering & Surveys Branch.\n\n744 W. Hastings St.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOctober 23, 1943.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq., Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Water Tank - Lejac Indian School.\n\nWith reference to your inquiry of October 13 regarding additional work on the above performed by contractor S.V. Cocker, there is no doubt that the plan is misleading in that it showed only one bolt where two existed. However, the difficulties mentioned by Mr. Cocker would likely only be encountered at the four lower corners next to the concrete pedestals and would not apply to all joints. If Mr. Cocker inspected the work to be done before making his tender he no doubt made an estimate of all of the material to be supplied and work to be performed and consequently noted the deficiency referred to.\n\nAlthough the estimate of $500.00 for the work is considered liberal, I would suggest that if Mr. Cocker supplies a statement showing the outlay for labour and material on the whole job and what he asserts was extra to the contract in support of his claim, as well as a statement that he did not inspect the work to be performed before signing a contract, I believe you would be fully justified in recommending his claim for payment.\n\n(SGD.) C. E. Webb\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nPer: W.C. Warren.\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for, B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith Voucher No. 115 for $545-00 in favour of Mr. S.V. Cocker for repairs to the supporting framework of the water tower at the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Cocker tendered to complete the work according to specifications for $60-00 but additional labour and material entailed, as described in the attached letter, which was not included in the specifications or shown on the sketch plan.\n\nMr. Cocker had to pay extremely high wages for three skilled men to assist him in this work and there is no doubt that considerable extra time was spent in removing the bolts referred to.\n\nI inspected the work on the 28th. inst. and am pleased to report the results are very satisfactory.\n\nI would recommend payment of the account in full.\n\nR. Howe,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure.\nVanderhoof, B.C.\nSeptember 27, 1943.\n\nR. McWe, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am pleased to be able to report that my contract to repair water tank supporting framework at Lejac Industrial School is now completed.\n\nYou will observe from Drawing No. 202 from which I estimated this job that the ends of all braces and girts, only one bolt is shown, but when I arrived on the job, to do the work, I found two bolts at ends of all braces and girts. This entailed considerable extra work as the water tank supporting framework was of course erected before the tower was built, and many of the bolts were driven from the inside, so that at the bottom we had to hacksaw off the heads of the bolts.\n\nTo drive those bolts (which for the most part were badly rusted) from their original awkward position, took considerable time and since I had to pay my carpenters $1.25 per hour, I respectfully request that you recommend to your Department an extra sum of Eighty-five ($85.00) dollars to cover this extra work and additional bolts.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.)

Once again we have to face the winter with a building that is almost impossible to heat due to the looseness of windows and doors. For several years we have been trying to get the exterior wood surfaces of the house painted, but have been unable to do so owing to the shortage of labour.\n\nWe find that our electrical output is now insufficient for our needs, and suggest that a larger Diesel generator be obtained by the Department from the War Assets Corporation. An output of at least 15 kw. would be desirable.\n\nThe boiler inspector made certain recommendations regarding our hot water supply which I hope will be accepted, because we are woefully short of hot water on bath days.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to Canadian National Railways,\n\nAddress C/o P.S.

Simpson, O.M.I., principal of the above school, in which he requests me to ask for a dough mixer for his school.\n\nThe authorized pupilage of this school is 160 and if we add the staff and the personnel, along with the extra pupils that they always have, the number of persons for whom the baking is done, is at least 200. That number corresponds with the figures of 1200 lbs. of flour which is being used weekly in the school. As baking four times a week is about the general practice in our residential schools, I believe that a dough mixer capable of handling three bags of flour, would be the proper one to buy.\n\nThe older girls of the school were in the habit of doing all the work in the baking room but due to war conditions the girls are now much younger and unable to perform this task satisfactorily. I, therefore, hope that you will be able to meet with Father Simpson's wishes in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O.

Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nLooking west along Fraser Lake from Fort Fraser.\nVancouver, B.C.\nDecember 29, 1945.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nRe: Water Supply, Lejac Indian Residential School, Lejac, B.C.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFollowing instructions received in your letter of November 14, 1945, I made an inspection of the intake and pumping plant at Lejac Indian Residential School on November 21.\n\nPresent Water Supply\n\nLejac Indian School is situated on the shore of Fraser Lake about three miles east of Fraser Lake railway station and about ten miles east of Endeko, a divisional point on the Jasper-Prince Rupert Branch of the Canadian National Railway. The water supply for the school is obtained from the lake by means of pumps which pump the water from a well on the lake shore to a 20,000 gallon elevated wood stave tank situated about 1,000 feet from the school and a half-mile from the lake.\n\nThe pump house is of frame construction on a concrete foundation over a concrete well thirteen feet deep to bed rock. The pumping is done by two Fairbanks Morse horizontal type double-acting 3\u00bd\" x 6\" stroke pumps, belt connected to each side of a 10 H.P. Fairbanks Morse horizontal gas engine. This plant will deliver 100 U.S. gallons per minute against 100-pounds pressure.\n\nThe water enters the pump house well through an intake pipe, the screened intake being in the lake about 300 feet from the well. On the intake line and about 40 feet from the well is a wooden settling box, 5 feet wide and...\n16 feet long to interrupt the flow of sand and gravel into the well. From this box the water is carried into the well by an 8-inch pipe.\n\nThe intake system has been working satisfactorily and ordinarily there is no drop in the water level of the well when both pumps are operating.\n\nReason for Inspection\n\nOn November 8 of this year the Principal of the School reported to the Indian Agent at Vanderhoof that owing to the low level of Fraser Lake, the intake pipe from the lake was exposed to frost and there was a grave danger of the domestic water supply for the school being cut off completely by freezing in the near future.\n\nInspection November 21, 1945.\n\nOn examining the well I found it to be 14\u00bd feet deep, measured from the floor of the pump house, with a depth of water of 8\u00bd feet. There appeared to be gravel on the well bottom.\n\nBoth pumps were put in operation and after about an hour's pumping the water in the well had been lowered eighteen inches and the pumps were starting to suck air. I was informed that the intake pipes from the pumps used to extend deeper into the well, but were shortened because of the tendency to suck up gravel from the well bottom. As this shortage of water coming into the well could only be caused by a plugging up of the intake pipe from the lake, and as under those circumstances the school did not have adequate water for fire protection, I suggested that the intake pipe be uncovered without delay so that the obstruction could be found and removed.\nAn examination of the intake showed the following arrangement (see plan attached):\n\n1. A wooden settling box 5 feet wide and 16 feet long, divided into two 5 x 8 sections by a cross partition, is placed on the intake line about forty feet from the pump house. The box was originally eight feet deep but during the high water of last spring floating logs knocked off the top two feet and the plank cover. The bottom of the box was 4\u00bd feet below the water surface. This box is necessary to allow the sand which is stirred up by wave action to settle out before the water goes into the well.\n\n2. The settling box was connected to the pump house well by an 8-inch iron pipe about four feet below the water level.\n\n3. An 8-inch iron pipe about 200 feet long extended out into the lake with a screen arrangement on the lake end. It was difficult to see exactly what the intake arrangement was but the screen appeared to be partially blocked with fungus and slime. The water was 3.5 feet deep at the intake, with the top of the pipe 2.6 feet below the surface. All of this pipe except the last sixty feet in the lake was underground and it is presumed that this was originally laid level, but that the shore end has gradually been heaved up by the frost since at this end the top of the pipe is only 1.6 feet below the water surface.\n\n4. Between the shore end of the iron pipe and the settling box was a space of about twenty feet, which I was informed was left as a filter. Subsequently this was opened up and there was found to be a wooden box pipe made of 2 x 10 plank between the end of the iron pipe and the settling box, but though it was connected to the box, there was no connection with the iron pipe; the ends of the two being separated by about three feet of gravel. This wooden box pipe was 21 inches below the level of the water.\nInspection November 26.\n\nAnother call was made at the school on November 26. In the meantime the wooden box pipe between the iron intake pipe and the settling box had been opened up and was found to be blocked up with gravel. This condition had been corrected and the water was running freely into the well. As this part of the intake was definitely subject to freezing during a severe winter it was decided to cover it over with a big bank of snow for protection until the system could be put into proper working order at a later date.\n\nFrom these inspections it was evident that the iron intake pipe in the lake was not functioning at all, the water evidently entering the settling box through the wooden box pipe which, being unscreened, eventually became full of sand and gravel.\n\nInspection of Lake Outlet\n\nWith the idea of determining whether or not it might be feasible to raise the level of Fraser Lake by a small dam at the outlet and also to find out how much lower the lake could drop, an examination was made of the lake outlet.\n\nThe water leaves Fraser Lake in two channels, separated by a low willow-covered island, evidently flooded at higher stages. (See attached sketch plan). The right hand channel was about 700 feet wide at the narrowest point, with a maximum depth of 0.3 feet. The left hand channel was 164 feet wide, with a maximum depth of 2.8 feet. The bottom was sandy for one to one and a half feet, and below that was hard blue clay.\n\nThese two channels come together into one stream about three-quarters of a mile below the lake outlet and just above the highway bridge. Here the stream is about 200 feet wide with a maximum depth of three feet. The fall\nfrom the lake outlet to the highway bridge is 0.4 feet. An excellent aerial view of this outlet is shown in the attached photograph from \"Report on Aerial Reconnaissance of Water Resources in the North Pacific Region\", by C.E. Webb and dated February 12, 1944.\n\nPrevious Reports\n\nIn a report by Mr. E.H. Trederoft, dated June, 1923, he proposes a well and pumping plant similar to that now in operation, with an intake from the lake, but no details of the intake are given. The system was apparently installed along the lines of this proposal in the latter part of 1923, under the supervision of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nRecommendations\n\nSince the present system has been working satisfactorily except for the accumulation of gravel in the wooden box pipe (which can be cleaned without any great difficulty) the only requirement is to adequately protect the intake system from frost. This could be accomplished in two ways:\n\n1. Raising the lake level\n2. Changing the intake layout.\n\nThe first of these alternatives is not recommended because of the expense of building and maintaining the necessary dam, the possibility of interfering with the movement of spawning fish and the possible objection of farmers who have hay meadows on the lake shore.\n\nI would therefore recommend that the intake be remodelled in the following manner (see plan attached):\n\n1. Discard the iron pipe in the lake. The system has been working satisfactorily without it and it is therefore not necessary. It is also likely that this pipe would fill with sand and would require flushing out from time to time.\n2. Repair the present settling box by replacing the part that has been broken off.\n\n3. Place or drive ten 2-inch sand points horizontally toward the lake and connect each one to the settling box by a 20-foot length of 2-inch galvanized iron pipe. By this means the necessary volume of water will be supplied to the settling box, from which it will enter the well by the present installation.\n\nThis work should be undertaken during the present low water and after the extreme cold weather.\n\nEstimate of Cost\n\nThe total cost of this work is estimated at $625.00. Details of the anticipated expenditure supporting this estimate are shown in Appendix I.\n\nT.H.

Boyd, dealing with suggested changes in the intake works for the water supply from Fraser Lake serving the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nIt would appear that the present water supply is being successfully obtained from the saturated gravel along the shore of the Lake. It is proposed to eliminate the intake pipe which is not connected directly to the intake well, and substitute a battery of ten sand points to draw and conduct the water into the settling box and thence via the present pipe to the intake well. The settling box is also to be repaired.\n\nThe sand points are to be placed about a foot lower in elevation than the present entrance to the settling box, which should give extra protection from the effects of frost.\n\nThe cost of the work is $625.00, and we concur in the proposal to carry out the work as soon as the present severe weather moderates.\n\nJ.

This equipment was reported to be in good operating condition at that time.\n\nIt is noted from your memorandum that Mr. T.J. Arnall, Boiler Inspector for the Department of Public Works, has recommended the installation of a new unit consisting of a 14 h.p. diesel engine with a 7 kw. D.C. generator. This would double the capacity of the plant.\n\nWe have no information as to the load the power plant has to carry at the present time, nor what additional amounts of electrical power may probably be required in the near future. We are, therefore, not in a position to assume responsibility as to whether the size of the additional unit recommended by Mr. Arnall is the size that should be secured.\nIf, however, you will advise us that responsibility for selection of the proper size of the unit has already been assumed, we will be glad to make a recommendation as to which unit of those offered by various firms, should be purchased.\n\nJ.

C.\n\nDear Sir: Re: Mechanical and Electrical Plant -\nIndian Residential School, Le Jac, B.C.\n\nWith reference to the letter of March 13th, 1946 from Mr. D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., enclosing letters from Survey and Engineering Branch, dated February 11th and March 7th, 1946, regarding the above and requesting further information, I beg to report as follows:\n\nThis plant was installed in 1933 and at that time, the estimated peak load was 6 K.W. What the actual peak load at the present time is, I cannot definitely say, but would be safe in assuming an increase of 30%. This will bring the present peak load to 7.8 K.W.\n\nWhat the future requirements will be is quite hard to say, when you take into consideration an institution of this type where the student body and staff numbers over 100, and all modern appliances are electrically operated. You can readily assume that the electric load will gradually increase until it reaches the capacity of the supply.\n\nWhen I recommended a 14 H.P. cold starting Diesel and a 7 K.W. 120 V. D.C. generator, I took the following into consideration:\n\nIn my report, dated August 29th, 1934, after the first season's operation, I pointed out that the plant was too small for peak load requirements. It has been operating under these conditions for the past 13 years.\n\nThe present plant is of English manufacture, and I doubt if there is a new spare part available at the present time anywhere in Canada or even at the factory. It has given remarkable service and reflects great credit on the manufacturer and the operating Engineer, but has reached the stage where a complete overhaul and renewal of parts are required.\n\nI recommended the 7 K.W. plant because when it is running in conjunction with either of the two present units, it will give a 9\u00bd or a 11\u00bd K.W. electric supply and in case either of the present units are out of commission, could take most of the load.\n\nI must also call your attention to the very isolated position of this school. The nearest point where supplies can be obtained is Edmonton, Alberta \u2014 30 train hours away and Vancouver, B. C. \u2014 58 train hours.\n\nYou can readily see the importance of getting a new unit, even if it is a K.W. or two over my recommendation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. J. Arnall\n\nT. J. Arnall,\nS.P.P.

The hot water supply is absolutely inadequate for the needs of the children.\n\n2. Additional space is required at this school in the form of more dormitory and dining-room facilities; and a hall for indoor recreation. All this could be taken care of by the addition of a single wing to the present building.\n\n3.

In your memorandum of January 31 you requested that the tenders be referred to the Surveys and Engineering Branch for consideration and recommendation.\n\nYour suggestion has been put into effect, but there has been some delay, due to the fact that we had to obtain additional information for the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nI now submit a memorandum from the Director of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, dated April 9 and recommending purchase of the unit offered by Vivian Engine Works, Limited. I also enclose the original tender and I would appreciate it if you would proceed with the purchase.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nApril 9th, 1946.\n\nMr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Mechanical and Electrical Plant,\nLejac Indian Residential School,\nStuart Lake Indian Agency,\nProvince of British Columbia.\n\nReference is made to your memorandum of March 22nd last, with attachments, and to previous correspondence relative to the above.\n\nThis matter was taken up with our Engineering and Construction Service and with regard to the tenders for equipment our Chief Engineer, Mr. Mills, states in part:\n\n\"In discussing the tenders submitted it should be borne in mind that no details of the existing electrical plant installation are available, other than the capacity of the generators, and it is assumed that all units tendered on, will fit the installed equipment in every respect.\n\n\"We consider that of the units for which tenders were received, the Vivian Gas Engine Works, Limited, offers that best adapted to the conditions at this school. This opinion is based on a consideration of the capacity and speed characteristics of the units described in the tenders. The Vivian plant using a 10 K.W. generator has, in itself, a capacity which is 3 K.W. in excess of the present undersized electrical plant, and provides flexibility in that an 18 K.W. generator may be connected to the prime mover (Diesel engine) at any time in the future when the load warrants it. This is a definite advantage in view of the fact that, as indicated in Mr. Arnall's report, the units...\"\nnow in operation, will not be of much further use, and in case of breakdown the entire load might have to be carried by the new plant. Should such a condition arise, the Vivian unit would only require that the 10 K.W. generator be replaced by an 18 K.W. generator using the same prime mover, thus saving the extra expenditure involved in obtaining a complete new unit. Maintenance is a prime factor when considering the isolated location of the school and, in our opinion, the heavier Vivian prime mover operating at a speed of between 500 and 600 R.P.M. driving a 10 K.W. generator will require less maintenance than the light weight Atlas prime mover operating at 1800 R.P.M. driving a 9 K.W. generator.\"\n\nIn view of Mr. Mills' report, as quoted above, it is recommended that the tender of the Vivian Gas Engine Works Limited be accepted.\n\nThe tenders, etcetera, are returned herewith.\n\n(sgd.)

Webb to which is attached a report covering an inspection of the above, as requested in our memorandum of May 11, 1946. We would direct your attention to Mr. Hoey's memorandum of April 26, 1946, in which complaints re the lack of hot water are outlined along with a request from the Principal to convert from wood fuel to oil.\n\nMr. T.H. Boyd, who made the inspection, submitted a report which has been condensed as follows, for your information:\n\n1. There are 2-50\" diameter x 14'-8\" long horizontal return tubular brickset heating boilers and they are in first class condition. Either boiler should be able to handle the load.\n\n2. Wood is used as fuel and Mr. Boyd states that 300 cords are used during the heating season; which is obtained at a cost of $5.00 per cord. Wood is plentiful but labour conditions make it difficult to arrange for cutting.\n\n3. The report states that a low grade coal is obtainable from the mines at Telkwa, about 160 miles away, and could be supplied to the School at $8.00 per ton.\n\n4. Oil is also available, but owing to the electric plant at the School being fully loaded, No. 1 grade oil or a distillate product, would have to be used. This would cost about fourteen cents per gallon. Please note that in order to burn the cheaper grades of oil, electric pre-heaters are required as part of the oil burning equipment.\n\n5. Regarding complaints of an inadequacy in the domestic hot water supply, the report states that a jacket heater of 350 gallon capacity is used in connection with a 600 gallon storage tank.\n\n6. Other items in the report giving data on the high pressure boiler and laundry service, do not enter into the picture. It can be stated that the report gives sufficient data to enable us to comment on the existing conditions and to recommend revisions to the plant which should overcome existing complaints.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6444, file SS1-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRegarding the Principal's request that the boilers be converted to the use of oil, the following analysis is submitted:\n\nThe school has a heating load of 6000 square feet of equivalent direct radiation. This figure was obtained from a survey of the original drawings. Forecasting fuel requirements for oil, based on the latest available data and figured from 0\u00b0 Fahrenheit to 70\u00b0 Fahrenheit, it would seem that 45,000 gallons of oil would be required. This oil would have to be No. 1 or Diesel oil and is priced at fourteen cents per gallon, which would make the season's fuel bill $6,300.00. Combustion efficiencies of about 75 per cent could reasonably be expected.\n\nIf coal, of a type available were used, it is anticipated that 450 tons would be required for the season, which, at a cost of $8.00 per ton would amount to $3,600.00. Using coal, hand fired, combustion efficiencies of about 55 per cent could be expected. Comparing the costs, therefore, we have:\n\n- 300 cords of wood @ $5.00 per cord (Mr. Bury's figures) $1,500.00\n- 45,000 gallons No.1 fuel oil @ .14\u00a2 gallon $6,300.00\n- 450 tons low grade coal (assumed output 10,000 B.T.U. per lb.) @ $8.00 $3,600.00\n\nIt should be borne in mind that to convert to oil it is estimated that equipment including tanks, burner for one boiler; and pumping apparatus (oil must be pumped from railway siding 1000 feet away) would cost about $6,000.00. No mention is made in the report of the type of pump or its drive required to do this work.\n\nIt is also pointed out that if coal is used, apart from some relatively minor expenses in connection with possible new grates and ash removal facilities, there would be no major items. It is roughly estimated that $1,000.00 to $1,500.00 would cover such changes.\n\nIt is our opinion that until such time as electric current can be supplied to the building by a Power Company, it would be uneconomical to use oil. Heavy grades of oil are cheaper than No. 1 distillate but they require electric pre-heating and as previously stated, the School's electrical plant being already fully loaded could not provide current for this purpose.\n\nRegarding the lack of hot water, it appears, after a study of the data contained in the report, that the present method of heating the water is at fault. A careful analysis reveals that a peak demand of 500 gallons of water per hour must be met according to accepted principles. One jacket heater, stated to be good for a 350 gallon tank, is in use in connection with a 600 Imperial gallon storage tank.\n\nSince there is more than ample boiler capacity, it is recommended that an indirect steam fed heater having a capacity to heat 600 Imperial gallons of water per hour through a 100 degree raise, be provided. The existing storage tank should be retained but should be fitted with a new hot water self-contained regulating valve.\n\nFor summer.........\nFor summer service, one new high-test jacket heater, capable of raising 450 gallons per hour through 100\u00b0 raise when hand fired with coal or wood, should be provided. Some revisions of a relatively minor nature to the piping will be necessary.\n\nBelow is a summary of the recommendations with an estimate of the cost involved:\n\n(1) Provide new grates for boilers, ash disposal facilities and accessory items - $1,500.00\n\n(2) Provide one new indirect steam fed heater with cast iron shell and removable copper tube element - $500.00\n\n(3) Provide hot water self-contained regulating valve with accessory piping connections, etc. - $150.00\n\n(4) Provide one new high-test jacket heater - $300.00\n\n(5) Pressure relief valve, piping and fittings - $50.00\n\nTotal - $2,500.00\n\nLabour - $1,000.00\n\nTotal - $3,500.00\n\nContingencies 10% - $350.00\n\nTotal - $3,850.00\n\nMr. Boyd's report goes on to state that some difficulty is experienced in properly heating the top floor and the reason given is that the windows are poorly fitted.

Howe, Indian Agent, Vanderhoof, B.C.\n\nThe Department is now in receipt of a report from the Surveys and Engineering Branch regarding their recent inspection of the mechanical equipment at the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nThey have stated that the cost of heating the school and forwarded the following estimate:\n\n1. 300 cords wood at $5.00 a cord (Mr. Boyd's figure) $1,500.00\n\n2. 45,000 gals. fuel oil @ .14\u00a2 a gal. 6,300.00\n\n3. 430 tons low grade coal @ $.80 3,440.00.\n\nYou will note from the above that the cost of heating is much cheaper with wood than with either oil or coal.\n\nThe change from the present heating system to either oil or coal would cost approximately $3,850.00.\n\nAt the present time we are not in a position to favourably consider the expenditure that would be requested and as there does not appear to be any necessity for immediate action it has been decided to postpone further consideration until next year.\nIt has been reported that some difficulty has been experienced in properly heating the top floor. The reason given is that the windows are poorly fitted. The Surveys and Engineering Branch state that this can be remedied by weather-stripping being placed on the windows.\n\nThe work of putting on the weather-stripping could be done by the school staff and it is presumed that the cost of material would not be excessive. You may, therefore, purchase what is required.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSup't of Welfare & Training.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Improvements at Lejac Indian Res. School, B.C.\nAttention: Mr. F. Phelan.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI found Lejac to be a modern and up to date school, in good condition. It is certainly a credit to your Department.\n\nThe following have been requested by the principal and I hope that his requests will be favourably considered:\n\n(1) The pupilage is now 170. The principal has had at least 185 on the roll and he now asks that the pupilage be increased by at least 15. In his case, as well as in the case of all the B.C. principals, it is becoming impossible to keep children for whom no grant is received.\n\n(2) This school is without any battery and the engine has to be started every time lights are needed. The engine, therefore, is running during the whole night. Consequently, this is very expensive and is also a fire hazard which should not exist.\n\n(3) The school never had a frigidaire and should be provided with one out of the 1946-47 vote. One similar to that provided for Beauval, or St. Phillips would be sufficient.\n\n(4) You have been mailing, for several years past, the school cheque to the bank manager at Prince George. This is useless and is only causing delay and annoyance. I know that you are not to blame for this but you will want, I am sure, to correct this strange anomaly.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ. J. Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa, 10 December 1946\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant regarding the installation of the new generating plant and switchboard at the Lejac Residential School, the Department approves you engaging the installation expert from the Mott Electric Company, Prince Rupert.\n\nWe will be responsible for his wages at the rate of $17.50 per 8 hour day and travelling expenses. It is felt that the school management should be prepared to supply the man with room and board without cost to the Department.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAirmail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Neary's letter of August 1st authorizing the purchase of a switchboard for the new generating plant at Lejac Indian residential school and in addition the expenditure necessary for the installation of the plant.\n\nThe switchboard and plant have now been delivered at the school, but despite various inquiries we have found it impossible to secure even an estimate of the cost of installing the equipment. The most attractive offer that we have had so far is from the Mott Electric Company, Prince Rupert, who have agreed to send an installation expert to Lejac to install the plant at a cost of $17.50 per 8 hour day, plus board and accommodation and travelling expenses. It is not thought that we will be able to secure a better offer than this and I would recommend the Department authorize me to instruct the Mott Electric Company Limited to proceed with the work on this basis. I may say Mr. Indian Agent Anfield secured the information for us with respect to the service of this Company.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, 4 December 1946.\n\nVivian Engine Works Limited,\n1100 West - 6th Avenue,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nRe: Purchase Order No. 10441\n\nDear Sirs:-\n\nThis order was issued on Apr. 27th, 1946, and covered a generating plant for the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nWe understand that the plant has not yet reached the school. Please let us know when you will be able to ship it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, 13 September 1946.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant with reference to the Lejac Residential School.\n\nYour recommendation regarding an increase in the pupilage and also with reference to supplying a frigidaire will be carefully considered when we are preparing our appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48.\n\nIt may interest you to know that several months ago we placed an order for a new generating plant for this school at an approximate cost of $3,000. Owing to conditions beyond our control, there has been a considerable delay in shipping the plant but we have been assured that it will reach the school in the near future.\n\nWith reference to the per capita allowance cheque, our records show that the Indian Agent wrote to us on October 11th, 1938, stating that in future Rev. Father Simpson requested that this cheque be forwarded each quarter to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Vanderhoof, B.C. We have carried out his request ever since and our file shows that the cheque has been sent as stated in the previous sentence. Consequently we don't understand your reference to Prince George. If Father Simpson wishes the cheque sent to any other address, we will be glad to do so on receipt of notice from him to that effect.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

The last temporary certificate which was issued on his behalf expired on March 16, but, owing to the fact that some additional work had to be done, which was not foreseen, it was necessary to retain his services to May 31. He was written to, however, and advised that his services must cease on that date.\n\nYesterday we received a telegram to the effect that a fire had broken out in the Fraser Lake school, which had caused about $1500.00 worth of damage, and, as immediate steps had to be taken to have the repairs made, we instructed Mr. Morley to proceed to the school, and to superintend the carrying out of the necessary work by day labour. I am making the extension to cover the period for which Mr. Morley has been employed, and the time we expect it will take to repair the school.\n\nI note from your letter of February 12, last, your file IA-IA2-362, that, if Mr. Morley's services are again to be utilized, you would like the position advertised, if considered necessary by the Commission, but it would be impossible for us to make a contract for the work, owing to the isolated location of the building and the fact that we do not call for tenders for repairs.

He was written to, however, and advised that his services must cease on that date.\n\nYesterday we received a telegram to the effect that a fire had broken out in the Fraser Lake school, which had caused about $1500.00 worth of damage, and, as immediate steps had to be taken to have the repairs made, we instructed Mr. Morley to proceed to the school, and to superintend the carrying out of the necessary work by day labour. I am making the extension to cover the period for which Mr. Morley has been employed, and the time we expect it will take to repair the school.\n\nI note from your letter of February 12, last, your file IA-IA2-362, that, if Mr. Morley's services are again to be utilized, you would like the position advertised, if considered necessary by the Commission, but it would be impossible for us to make a contract for the work, owing to the isolated location of the building and the fact that we do not call for tenders for repairs. The case is very urgent, and, as we know of no one available in British Columbia as well qualified to do the work as Mr. Morley, we trust you will favourably consider his appointment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWm.

(RG 10, Volume 6445, file 881-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAuditor General's Office, Canada\n\nOTTAWA, February 26th, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to ask your attention to the payments made by you to Mr. Myles Morley, as Inspector of Construction at the Fraser Lake Indian Boarding School, since July, 1922.\n\nMr. Morley was paid during the fiscal years 1922-23 for 224 days at $6 a day, being for every day included in the period from July 16th, 1922, to February 26th, 1923, with the exception of 4 days in July. During the current fiscal year he has been paid continuously at the same rate from March 1st to May 31st. On looking over the returns for previous years I find that Mr. Morley was paid continuously at the same rate, from October 15th, 1919 to February 26th, 1922, while engaged on inspection work on other schools.\n\nThe rates established in the Classification List for the position of Inspector of Construction are:\n\nMonthly - $100, 105, 110, etc., to $140.\nDaily - Prevailing rates not exceeding $7 for services as required.\n\nI understand this to mean that when the employment is not continuous the inspector may be paid up to $7 a day for those days only on which he is actually engaged on the work, but that when the employment is continuous the monthly rates shall apply. The prevailing rates paid during any month should not exceed the maximum monthly rate of $140.\n\nI should\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nI should also like to ask your attention to the dates on which the certificates for Mr. Horley's employment were issued by the Civil Service Commission. On February 9th, 1928, a certificate for his employment for six months from July 16th, 1927, was issued, and on the same date a second certificate extending his employment to March 16th was issued; again on June 15th a certificate was issued further extending his employment to July 16th. As Mr. Horley received his pay regularly month by month it would appear that his pay cheques were issued in a number of cases prior to the authorisation of his employment. I trust you will take steps to prevent the recurrence of a like irregularity in the future.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nas, Auditor General.\n\nJWA/MVT\nFebruary 27, 1924.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, with reference to payments made by this Department to Mr. Myles Morley as Inspector of Construction at the Fraser Lake Indian boarding school since July, 1922. I have noted what you say, that is, that when an Inspector of Construction is employed continuously during the month his services should be paid at the monthly rate.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the certificates of temporary appointment were issued by the Civil Service Commission for certain specified periods with remuneration at the rate of $6.00 per day. No mention was made of a monthly rate, and the Department paid at the rate which was provided for in the certificates. However, in the future we will be guided by your interpretation of the regulations, and, in employing men as Inspectors of Construction, we will specify that they are to be paid at the rate of $6.00 per day, but that their monthly remuneration must not exceed $140.00, the maximum provided under the classification schedule.\n\nThe last paragraph of your letter has been noted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWm.

We found that practically every seam, both inside and outside the sections, were open, and definitely beyond repair. I am enclosing Voucher No. 146 for $10.50, in favour of Mr. Patterson, for wages in this connection.\n\nThe second-hand replacements were formerly in use at the Prince George Military Camp for two seasons only, and they are in excellent condition, and very reasonably priced compared to new radiators which are practically impossible to obtain.\n\nA Voucher covering the freighting of the radiators from Prince George to the Lejac School will be submitted shortly.\n\n(Sgd.

Re-puttying all windows and cracks and additional storm windows are urgently required in order to prevent a recurrence of conditions during the sub-zero temperatures last winter, when 15 radiators were frozen beyond repair and had to be replaced at considerable expense.\n\nThe roof of the School building was given two coats of stain 5 years ago, but judging from its appearance, it is considered another coat is essential while the painters are on the job.\n\nWe have been endeavoring for the past 4 years to obtain Tenders for this work, but due to circumstances beyond control, we were unable to interest any Firm in the work, until this year. As far as I am aware the G.H. Adomeit Company is the only competent Firm available for this type of work in the entire district.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 11th instant with reference to exterior painting and supplying of storm windows at the Lejac Residential School.\n\nOn September 3rd, 1946, we forwarded to you a copy of our letter of the same date to Indian Agent Howe with reference to a report submitted to this office by the Surveys and Engineering Branch in which they suggested major changes in the mechanical equipment at the Lejac school, involving an expenditure of $3,850.\n\nIf we proceed with the work suggested by the Surveys and Engineering Branch, the funds provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school will be completely used and we would not have funds available for the work mentioned in your letter of April 11th.\n\nBefore making a decision on your letter of April 11th, we thought you might like to communicate with Indian Agent Howe with a view to ascertaining what work is considered most urgent by the Principal of the Lejac School and Mr. Howe.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nAIR MAIL.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Howe's letter of March 31st, and Tender from G. H. Adomeit & Company, for exterior painting and the supply of fifty storm windows for the Lejac Indian Residential School, at a total cost of $3,206.00.\n\nAn amount of $1,275.00 was provided in the 1947-48 estimates for exterior painting and a further amount of $980.00 for other repairs, a total of $2,255.00. It is noted that the exterior facings on the building have not been painted since the school was built in 1921 which indicates, without doubt, that in order to protect the department's investment the matter should be attended to as soon as possible. As Mr. Howe states that G. H. Adomeit and Company, is the only competent firm available to do the work, I would recommend that Mr. Howe be authorized to instruct them to proceed with the painting and other repairs in accordance with their Tender when weather conditions permit.\n\nIf the full amount of $3,206.00, is not available, I should appreciate being advised just what funds are available so that Mr. Howe can secure from the Company information as to what painting and repairs can be completed for this amount.\n\nD.

Although an order was placed with the Electric Equipment Co. Ltd., Edmonton, the motor was unavailable prior to the end of the fiscal year. Mr. Howe has now secured a quotation on a used 5 H.P.

Equipment Company Ltd., Vancouver who state that the motor and rheostat are in first class shape and are practically as good as new. The price asked by the Company is $200.00 and as it appears that new motors will not be available for at least three months I would recommend that authority be granted to purchase the used motor above referred to.\n\nfor D.

It is therefore recommended that the tender of G. H. Adomeit & Company, in the amount of $2,751.00, covering exterior painting be accepted and if funds are available that authority be granted for the purchase of 50 storm windows from the same Company at a cost of $475.00.\n\nA copy of Mr. Howe's letter of May 3rd and a copy of a letter dated April 30th from the Reverend Principal in connection with these matters are enclosed for your information.\n\nfor D.

During the cold spell of last winter we were seriously considering the possibility of having to send a number of the children home; parts of the building being absolutely uninhabitable.\n\nMr. Boyd, the engineer who made the survey of the heating system, stated that the heating system of the building proper was adequate, and I agree with him. I would not expect the Department to spend $10,000.00 here to install an oil-burning system. Last winter, at our own expense, we converted one of the heating boilers from wood to coal. This boiler consumed about 200 tons of coal during the winter. The other boiler burned about 150 cords of wood, and was only fired when the coal burner was unable to heat the building alone.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Alex. R.

The account was mislaid and was only forwarded to us within the last few days and you will note that it totals $3,265.36. The reason for the difference in the size of the account is explained by requisition of July 16th, 1946, covering generator control for the machine.\n\nWe authorized this purchase and would, therefore, appreciate it if you would revise the purchase order so that we may pay the account in the amount now submitted, namely $3,265.36.\n\nBernard F.

On receipt of your letter, I made inquiries and apparently, Father Simpson had filed the account, and forgotten all about it.\n\nMay I suggest in future, that Purchase Orders indicate accounts be rendered direct to this office rather than to the Principal of the School.\n\nR.

(RG 10, Volume 6445, file 881-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nLejac Indian Residential School  \nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers  \nLejac, B.C.\n\nOct. 27 1947\n\nMr. R. Howe  \nIndian Agent  \nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am submitting a request for an increase in grant and my reasons are as follows.\n\n1) FARMING. In this locality, according to meteorological reports, there is an average of sixty-five frost-free days a year. This does not give sufficient time for crops to mature. During the past four years there have been two complete crop failures. In 1945 $4000 was spent for feed for the stock at this school. The cash crop for farmers in the Prince George area is grass seed but it is not a practical crop for an Indian school. The grant given to schools that have farms is always smaller but in this case I think consideration should be taken of the fact that this farm is north of the fifty-fourth parallel where farming is not a paying proposition.\n\n2) FREIGHT RATES. The cost of bringing one hundred pounds of repacked groceries from Vancouver is $2.67 or $3.40 a ton. For sacked grain or vegetables it is $1.69 per cwt. or $35.20 a ton. It strikes a medium of over $40.00 a ton. This is in comparison with $7.00 a ton to the Sechelt, Port Alberni, Christie and Alert Bay Schools.\n\n3) CLOTHING. More warm clothing must be supplied in this area than on the coastal schools or those in the southerly parts of the country. In this backward district where the parents do not willingly send their children to school they do not furnish any of the clothing at all.\n\n4) VACATION. Many of the children come from far off places and do not go home during the holidays. There were over forty children here for the holidays last year. At other schools the vacation time is the period when finances can be recuperated for the remainder of the year.\n\n5) WAGES. Wages have increased during the past year. In this isolated spot inducements must be offered to the men and we have to compete with the logging camps in the vicinity. For the four men on the farm, manager, barn man, gardener and labourer the yearly wage is $5040. For engineer, carpenter and disciplinarian the yearly wage is $4020. This does not include other staff members.\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\nLejac, B.C.\n\n6) FIRE LOSS. A fire which took place last week destroyed $3000 worth of feed and $500 worth of barn equipment. The weather in this country was so rainy during the harvest months that the hay could not be properly cured. This condition was probably the cause of this loss.\n\nThe school is gradually going deeper into debt every year and it cannot keep on at this pace. In September when I took charge there was a deficit at the bank of $11000 and outstanding bills of approximately $3000. Would it be possible for the auditor to come here in the near future and audit the books having in view an estimation of the cost of running the school. Using these figures as a basis for setting an equitable grant.\n\nHoping this will meet with favourable consideration.\n\nYours truly\n\nLEJAC INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

C.\n\nFROM: The Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nRE: Lejac Indian Residential School\nApplication for increased grant\n\nI refer to Mr. Indian Agent Howe's letter of November 6th and the attached letter from the Principal of the above mentioned school. I feel that I am not in a position to make any recommendation with regard to the amount of any increase that might be allotted to this school. This should be based upon the per capita cost of operation and I have no information as to how much this is. At the present time there are three schools in this Province which exceed the per capita grant of the Lejac Residential School. These are: The Alberni Residential School - per capita grant, $225, The Christie Residential School - per capita grant, $235, and the Crosby Girls home - per capita grant $245. The present per capita grant for the Lejac School is $220. Due to the size of the Crosby Girls home it is not a satisfactory basis for comparison. There is no doubt in my mind that the cost of operating the Lejac School is higher than either of the other two schools which may be compared with it. The reasons for this are set forth clearly in the Reverend Principal's letter.\n\nAt the present time I understand there is a debt of approximately $14,000. This undoubtedly handicaps the operation of the school which is in need of a number of improvements. It is extremely doubtful if the principal will be able to effect these improvements as long as he is handicapped by a large deficit. Whether or not this deficit is the result of higher per capita costs or because of the loss involved in the operation of rather an extensive farm I am not prepared to say. I do believe however that some assistance should be given the school to enable it to free itself of its indebtedness and I recommend that consideration be given to the request of the principal that an auditor visit the school in the near future in order that some sound basis of assistance might be arrived at.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDist. Inspector of Indian Schools.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, November 19, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn a letter dated October 25th Indian Agent Howe advised us that the barn at the LeJac School had been completely destroyed by fire on October 23rd. In addition to the loss of the barn and silo, 110 tons of hay and alfalfa, 15 tons of grain, milking machine, grinding machine, 2 sets of harness and assorted implements were also destroyed. The estimated loss of feed is approximately $3,000 and the equipment, $500.00.\n\nIn a recent letter Indian Agent Howe advises that the principal has secured several thousand feet of lumber and renovated an old building to provide accommodation for the stock during the coming winter. Indian Agent Howe recommends that we grant an amount of $3,500 to replace the hay, grain and equipment lost in the fire.\n\nIt has not been our practice in the past to make such a grant but there may be special reasons why this action should be taken in regard to the LeJac School.\n\nPlease let me have your recommendation in the matter.\n\nBernard F.

The Principal has secured several thousand feet of lumber and renovated an old building to provide temporary accommodation for the Stock for the present season.\n\nThe most urgent need at present is the replacement of hay, grain and equipment amounting to approximately $3,500.00, lost in the fire. I would recommend that a special grant be made available at the earliest possible date for this purpose.\n\nI would also recommend that the Principal be reimbursed for the material purchased for the temporary accommodation, at a cost of $350.00.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\ncc: Major D.M.

Howe, Indian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nWe received your letter of the 25th ultimo and regret very much the loss sustained at the Lejac school by the destruction of the barn by fire.\n\nWe are prepared to ask the Minister's office for funds to replace the barn but before doing so we would like to know if a new barn could be erected at the present season of the year, even if funds were made available.\n\nPlease let me have your reply by air mail.\n\nBernard F. Henry\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MSD\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI regret to report that the Cow Barn at the Lejac Indian Residential School was completely destroyed by fire of unknown origin, at 3:40 P.M., Oct. 23rd last. I am enclosing herewith, a report from the Reverend J.P. Mulvihill, Principal, giving the details.\n\nThis is indeed a severe loss to the School, and places an additional burden of debt on the new Principal's shoulders. I would strongly recommend that a special grant be made to cover the loss of Hay, Grain and equipment destroyed.\n\nIn view of the circumstances, it is difficult to define the cause of the fire. Personally, I am inclined to believe it was spontaneous combustion in the hay loft.\n\nR. Howe\nIndian Agent\n\ncc: Major D.M. Mackay.\nReport of fire at Lejac School - Cowbarn and silo\n\nAt 3:40 P.M. on Oct. 23rd the farm manager, Mr. J. Farrell noticed smoke coming from the loft of the barn. He gave the alarm and the workmen and boys rushed over. The cows and horses were put out. The smoke was too dense in the loft to get a hose up from the inside so a hole was chopped in the roof and the hose was inserted. Water was played on the blaze which had started near the angle of the roof and floor of the loft. Within three or four minutes flames were leaping from both ends of the loft and an intense heat had developed. It was too late to save the barn then so I ordered them to hose the adjacent buildings. The silo which was attached to the barn burned but some of its contents were saved. The staff worked admirably, one of them a Polish Veteran manned the hose in such intense heat, saving the other buildings, that water had to be thrown on his clothing to prevent them from catching on fire.\n\nThe water pressure was sufficient but a dozen streams of water would not have quenched the fire three minutes after we had an opening made to reach the flames. The pressure at first was directly from the water pump but after half an hour it started to suck mud and sand from the lake bottom so we turned it over to gravity feed from the water tank.\n\nThe loss in addition to the barn and silo included 110 tons of hay and alfalfa, 15 tons of grain, milking machine, grinding machine, two sets of harness and assorted implements. The estimated loss of feed would be approximately $3000 and $500 in equipment.\n\nThe probable cause of fire\u2014It was either spontaneous combustion or defective wiring. I cannot be certain but I would favour defective wiring. The lighting plant had been on less than ten minutes when the smoke was noticed. The origin of the fire was in the loft in the vicinity of the fuse box. On the other hand the blaze developed so rapidly that it might suggest spontaneous combustion.\nStuart Lake Agency,\nVanderhoof, B.C.,\nNovember 8th, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M.

(RG 10, Volume 6445, file 881-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of November 19th in connection with the loss sustained by the Lejac Indian Residential School when the barn and silo were destroyed by fire, Mr. Indian Agent Howe has been forwarding copies of his communications to you to this office and the question of replacement of the loss has been under consideration in conjunction with an application from the Reverend Principal for an increase in the per capita grant. I am enclosing for your information a copy of Mr. Indian Agent Howe's letter of November 6th and application from reverend Father Mulvihill for an increased grant, together with a memorandum from District School Inspector Davey dated November 18th. You will note that when Father Mulvihill assumed his duties as Principal of this school last September the school had a bank deficit of $11,000 and outstanding accounts totalling $3,000 and if we add to these amounts the value of buildings, equipment and forage destroyed by fire it is obvious that the school cannot possibly meet the indebtedness from the present per capita grant.\n\nAuditor's reports received from year to year indicate that the school farm has never been a financial asset and it is possible that the cost of operating the farm is largely responsible for the present indebtedness of the school. School Inspector Davey suggests that favourable consideration be given to the Principal's request that an auditor visit the school in the near future with a view to determining a sound basis on which financial assistance might\nbe given and although this suggestion is recommended I feel that in the interval if funds can be made available the Department should come to the assistance of this school with a grant to replace the hay, grain, and equipment lost in the fire.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, November 28, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Lejoe Indian Residential School,\nProvince of British Columbia.\n\nThe above is a Government-owned school with an authorized pupilage of one hundred and seventy five.\n\nOn October 23rd, 1947, the barn at this school was destroyed by fire. We have been in communication with the Indian Agent and also with Indian Commissioner MacKay regarding the matter and we are advised that temporary accommodation has been provided for the live stock during the coming winter. However, with the destruction of the barn and silo, the school management lost 110 tons of hay and alfalfa, 15 tons of grain, milking machine, grinding machine, two sets of harness and assorted implements. Indian Commissioner MacKay states that the cost of the feed that was destroyed by fire is approximately $3,000, and the cost of the equipment $500, or a total loss to the school management of $3,500.\n\nIn order to permit the school to continue efficient operation, it will be necessary to replace the feed and equipment at the earliest possible date. This is a special case and Major MacKay considers that we should reimburse the school management to the extent of $3,500.\n\nAt the present time we are paying the school an Emergency Grant of $35. If we allow this school an Emergency Grant of $55, for the calendar year 1947 it would mean an extra payment to them of $3,500, as their average\npupilage is one hundred and seventy five.\n\nFunds for this payment are available in the current year's appropriation and I would appreciate it if you would approve the above mentioned extra payment being made.\n\nPP/MJD\n\nDirector.\n| Item Description                          | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| 0-150 D.C.

He recommends a new pump at the building itself. Under the present system in case of fire we have to run a quarter of a mile to turn on the pump at the lake then go another quarter of a mile in another direction to shut off the valve at the water tank. By this time the fire could be out of control.\n\nHe recommends a starter for the Diesel engine; the present system is very dangerous.\n\nHe recommends emergency repairs to be done at once on the main water line at the tank.\n\nHe finds the piping and woodwork in the laundry in bad shape.\n\nThe heating system is badly in need of repairs. The installation of this system twenty-five years ago could not have been done according to contract. The return pipes were placed in such a way that it is impossible to prevent air locks. At present it is impossible to heat one wing of the building properly. The pipes in some places are paper thin, the fittings on the radiators are so badly corroded that half of them do not function properly. The Dunham Company of Edmonton states that the system is too antiquated to procure parts and suggest that it be modernized.\n\nIn view of these facts, some of an emergency, would it not be possible to send a Heating Engineer to examine the system and take some steps to put it in working order. It is twenty-five years old. In view of the fire hazard I think that it should be done with the least possible delay.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Upon his return he is to be requested to prepare his report and forward same to this Division without further delay.\n\nWe have reason to believe that the mechanical services at the above school are in need of a major overhaul and extensive replacements. When Mr. Unsworth's report is received and studied, it may indicate the necessity of a survey being made by our Heating Engineer.\n\nThis school is one of the projects on the list for attention by the Donald Inspection Company but it may be considered necessary to carry out repair work, etc., to the mechanical services before their report is received.\n\nWhen Mr. Unsworth's report is received and analyzed, you will be further advised.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.

The principal's letter reads as follows:\n\n\"In reply to your letter concerning the estimate for a new barn I have gone into the question with a competent builder and find that the cost of materials for a barn 36 x 60 together with cost of construction would be very close to $15,000. To keep sufficient cows milking to supply the needs of the school we would need a barn 36 x 60 as a minimum. The cost of a barn in this cold climate is higher than it would be in other parts of the Province. It would be very poor economy to build a smaller barn that would not take care of our needs. I hope that this request will be granted.\"\n\nWe would appreciate it if you could have your agricultural supervisor advise what size barn he considers should be erected at the Lejac school.

His report will enable us to decide whether or not it will be necessary to send our Mr. Hargreaves to the school before a final and complete recommendation can be made by this Division.\n\nConsequently, we are writing to Mr. Webb and requesting him to have a preliminary inspection carried out at once, and upon receipt of his reply, you will be further advised.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A.

Yesterday I wired Mr. Arnell and he replied that there was no report ready from that Branch.\n\nThe engineer told me that he was recommending a stoker for the boiler and an electric pump located on the school for the main water supply. You can see from the previous correspondence that the fire fighting set up is very poor. At present the pump house at the edge of the lake is under water and we have to pump the water with a hose to the main supply tank. The main pipe from the water tank is in very poor condition; this was mentioned as an emergency repair in the inspectors report. The radiators, according to the engineer, are 75% defective.\n\nAny Building and Repairs grant for this year should be used for these repairs especially for a stoker. The cost of wood in this district and in these times of inflationary prices is prohibitive.\n\nWould it be possible for you to see if some action could be taken in this matter before it is too late as I don't think that we can carry on for another winter under the present conditions.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention in the past.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.P. Mulvihill\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\nLejac, B.C.\n\nJan. 9th 1948\n\nMr. R. Howe\nIndian Office\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to the Boiler Inspectors report-\n\nThe fire pump which is also the main water supply pump is out of date and in very poor repair. He recommends a new pump at the school building itself. Under the present system in case of fire we have to run a quarter of a mile to start the pump and then run another quarter of a mile in another direction to shut off the valve at the water tank. By this time the fire could be out of control.\n\nHe recommends a starter for the Diesel lighting plant, the present system is very dangerous.\n\nHe recommends emergency repairs to be done at once on the main water line at the tank.\n\nHe finds the piping and woodwork in the laundry in bad shape.\n\nThe heating system is badly in need of repair. The installation of this system twenty-five years ago could not have been done according to contract. The return pipes were placed in such a manner that it is impossible to prevent air locks. At present it is impossible to heat one wing of the building properly. The pipes in some places are paper thin, the fittings on the radiators are so badly corroded that half of them do not function. The Dunham Company of Edmonton states that the system is so antiquated that parts are no longer procurable. They suggest modernizing the system.\n\nIn view of these facts, some of an emergency nature would it not be possible to send a heating engineer to examine the system and some steps be taken to place it in working order. In view of the fire hazard I think that it should be done with the least possible delay.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This document is a twenty-eight (28) page treatise, and the author has presented a great deal of information which will take some little study to digest. Two drawings and a map showing the location of the school are attached to the report.\n\nA preliminary analysis shows that vitally essential data necessary to make definite recommendations are lacking, and this statement is in no way intended to reflect on Mr. Unsworth's effort.\n\nBefore a recommendation calling revisions or additions to the equipment can be made, it is felt that we should await result of the Donald Inspection Company's report.\n\nIn the meantime, we will prepare an interim recommendation based on Mr. Unsworth's data with reference to the possibility of increasing the efficiency of operation of the present system and we expect to submit this within the next few days.\n\nFrom a preliminary study of Mr. Unsworth's report, it can be inferred that poor attention to the operation of the mechanical services, particularly the heating equipment, is responsible to some degree for lack of heat in some parts of the building.\n\nR.A.

Until we have this report, no action will be taken.\n\nBernard F.

It is noted that you have written to the Donald Inspection Limited and that you will advise us further when you receive their report.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/MGD\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Lejeu Indian Residential School,\nStuart Lake Agency, B.C.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of July 7th with reference to the report submitted by Mr. A. Unsworth of Mr. Webb's office, the following preliminary analysis is presented for your information and transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIt can be assumed from the report that the building is equipped with a Dunham Return Heating System, and that the rear section of the installation was not installed to this principle, which has resulted in an unsatisfactory distribution of heat to this area.\n\nThe report goes on to state that the ground floor of the front section of the building is satisfactorily heated, but that difficulty is experienced with the upper floors.\n\nIt is also reported that a pressure of eight ounces per square inch is carried in the boilers. This would be in order if the piping was of consistent good design and if the firing periods were not spaced too far apart. Since no mention is made of a condensation pump, it may be assumed from Mr. Unsworth's description of the system that in addition to air eliminators, return traps is used. This trap is not mentioned in the report and it is likely that when revisions are made a condensation pump will be found necessary.\n\nOn January 9th, Reverend J.P. Mulvihill, Principal of the school reported that the Edmonton office of the C.A. Dunham Company stated that the system was too antiquated to procure replacement parts, and suggested that it be modernized. The Principal also stated some of the piping was \"paper thin\". These points were not commented on in Unsworth's report. The report does state however, that some radiator valve handles are missing and that some valves are damaged and are in a locked position either open or closed or partially open. The radiator traps are said to be in good condition as far as can be observed. In addition to the foregoing, it is pointed out in the report that some rooms are overheated with all the radiators turned on while others are cold with some radiators turned off. This would indicate that either the valves are not easy to operate or that little or no attempt is made to operate them. It is evident from Mr. Unsworth's report that extensive alterations and replacements will be required to put this system into good operating condition.\n\nIn delivering coal to the boiler room from the outside, an old cauldron on a rope sling is used and is manned by the older boys. This operation takes place daily and results in the outside door being left open for approximately three hours.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6445, file 881-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThis is a source of great heat loss from the building and on occasions has caused the blow-down piping from the gauge glass on one of the boilers to freeze. It is stated that a small storage bin is being prepared to eliminate the present system of sealing.\n\nThe boilers are subjected to uneven firing and as a result a great deal of condensation forms in some parts of the system and until this is cleared by the traps and the air eliminators, steam for heating can not be satisfactorily distributed. Many other items can be cited to further explain the general unsatisfactory state of the heating system.\n\nWhile there is a great deal of meticulous and detailed information in the report, some vitally essential observations are missing and lacking these data, it is not possible to definitely recommend extensive changes to the present installation.\n\nSumming up, it can be stated that one stoker should be installed, the air eliminators removed and one condensation pump be provided. It is also likely that much of the piping will have to be replaced and some parts of the system will require redesigning. The installation is twenty five (25) years old and of a design now considered to be more or less obsolete and it can be expected that a general deterioration will have taken place.\n\nHowever, until more detailed technical data is available, it is not possible to prepare a design showing the full extent of the revisions which may be necessary and it is suggested that the Donald Inspection Limited's report should be available before a commitment is made by this Division.\n\nWe are writing to the Donald Inspection Limited and requesting them to amplify certain phases of Mr. Unsworth's report and to provide this Division with the necessary technical data in order that we may prepare a recommendation.\n\nWhen the Donald Inspection Limited's report is received, and analyzed, you will be further advised.\n\nChief Engineer.\nAugust 24, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMAJOR MacKAY\n\nFormer Agency Boat - \"Takulli\".\n\nPlease find attached two self-explanatory letters advising that Reverend Father Mulvihill has decided that the upkeep and responsibility of the boat would involve too great a financial burden for the school.\n\nIn view of the information contained in these two letters, I would recommend that this boat be declared surplus to our requirements.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFN/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: your file 163-1-5(E)\n\nI wish to refer to your letter dated July 28th, 1948, to the Reverend J.P. Mulvihill, Principal of the Lejac Residential School advising that the Agency Boat \"Takulli\" has been transferred to the Education Division for use of the Lejac Residential School.\n\nI am enclosing herewith, a copy of a letter received from the Reverend Principal advising that he is now of the opinion the upkeep and responsibility of the boat would involve too great a financial burden for the School.\n\nIn view of this I would recommend the boat be placed in the hands of the Salvage Division for disposal. I believe if the boat is advertised for sale, Tenders will be submitted from several of the local residents at Fort St. James.\n\nThe boat is stored in the boat house which will be required for the new boat in October, it will therefore be appreciated if the Department will take prompt action to dispose of the \"Takulli.\"\n\nAugust 17, 1948\n\nP.M.

Mulvihill, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nLejac Indian Residential School,\nLejac, B.C.\n\nDear Father Mulvihill:\n\nIn the absence of Colonel Neary on a business trip, I discussed yesterday with the Acting Director, Major MacKay, the situation at the Lejac School as regards the barn.\n\nIndian Commissioner Arnell has forwarded us a tender for the erection of a new barn at an approximate cost of $16,000.00.\n\nNo funds were specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for this amount, which would likely be exceeded before the building was finally completed.\n\nIf we decided to proceed with the building now, it would be necessary to secure an Order in Council and transfer funds, all of which involves considerable time, before we could definitely advise the contractor to proceed with the work.\n\nIn view of the above, we would be delayed in a manner beyond our control and as a result, it might be too late to do concrete work this fall.\nWe are anxious to know if you could get along for this winter with what accommodation you have available. If so, we will be able to provide the funds in the regular way and proceed with the erection of the barn as early next spring as building conditions will permit.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\no/c to Mr. Arneil.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Barn-Lejac Residential School\n\nFurther to my letter of September 3rd, Superintendent Rowe, reference his letter of September 17th and enclosures attached, has secured a tender from Bovill & Hann, Contractors, Smithers, B.C., covering the supply or materials and the erection of the above mentioned building, at a cost of $14,661.65, which amount includes the provision of concrete which will necessitate, in the event that their tender is accepted, an adjustment for sand and gravel already delivered to the site.\n\nMcLennan, McFeely & Prior Ltd., reference their quotation of July 30th attached, are in a position to supply the steel barn equipment and it is apparent from all this information that the cost of the building complete and including preparation of the site will be almost $16,000.00.\n\nLittle time remains for completion of the concrete work prior to frost and if the necessary funds can be made available I would recommend immediate acceptance of the tender from Bovill & Hann and that they be instructed to proceed with the work. In the event that their tender is accepted further information will be secured for them regarding specifications for the silo.\n\nW.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n-mh\nencls.\nW.S.

Indian Affairs\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRE: Barn - Lejac Residential School\n\nWith reference to Superintendent Howe's letter of August 26th attached, it is presumed that authority for securing the sand and gravel required for the above-mentioned barn will be contingent upon funds being made available for the structure this year which, in turn, will depend entirely on the cost of the building, an estimate of which is not immediately available.\n\nI would suggest, however, that if there is any possibility of construction being proceeded with this year that you authorize Mr. Howe by wire to secure the sand and gravel at a cost of $370.00, which amount includes removing the old concrete from the barn site.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nEncl.\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., VANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nRe: Barn - Lejac Residential School\nYour file No. 14-11-3\n\nWith reference to your letter dated August 4th, I am having difficulty obtaining local tenders for material and labour for constructing the new barn at the Lejac School, however, I hope to have results in the near future.\n\nIn the meantime, immediate authority is requested for an expenditure of approximately $370.00 for the following:\n\n60 cu. yds. gravel delivered at Site @ $3.00 per yd. $180.00\n30 cu yds. sand \" \" \" @ $3.00 per yd. 90.00\nHire of Bulldozer removing old concrete from Barn site -approx. 100.00\n\n$370.00\n\nThe Reverend Principal agreed to supply the sand and gravel, but he advises that he was under the impression it could be obtained on the lakeshore near the school. Apparently the sand and gravel available at the lake shore is not suitable for concrete and it is necessary to haul the gravel from a pit 8 miles away. The Principal states that the financial circumstances of the School will not permit the expenditure.\n\nAt the present time, the Provincial Department of Public Works have a gasoline Shovel, Dump-trucks and Bulldozer working at the pit, and the local Superintendent has agreed to haul the gravel and Bulldoze the concrete from the old Barn site at the price mentioned above.\n\nIt will be appreciated if authority for the expenditure may be wired to me as the equipment will be moved within 10 days, and will not be available again for several months.\n\nIf this work has to be done by hand labour, I feel sure the cost will be double, at least.\n\n[Signature]\nHowe,\nSuperintendent.\n\nBY AIR MAIL\nPAR AVION\nAugust 31, 1948.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. W.S.

(RG 10, Volume 6445, file 881-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nType of Heating:\n\nThe building is heated by two horizontal return tubular boilers of (?) 104 h.p. each. This system is the Dunham type. It is obsolete, and consists of steam traps at each radiator and a separate line for the release of the condensate by gravity to the boilers. (This is called the line, and a separate line for discharging the air from the system is called the dry line). This system does not operate satisfactorily, and appears to have been messed up so that nobody seems to know where it is.\n\nWe noticed also that the inlet valves for the steam are connected at the top of each radiator instead of at the bottom.\n\nI suggest that every steam trap in this building be examined, as we are sure all are not functioning properly; do away with the air line and run wet return back to a receiving tank and vacuum pump, which will make this system less complicated, and still sufficient heat to make the building comfortable. You will note that this does not make very much change in the present system as the steam traps are already installed, and the only thing to be done is to disconnect the air pipes and remove them entirely; connect the steam inlets to the bottom of the radiator and run the existing wet return to the receiving tank, which is part of the vacuum pump mentioned above. The most satisfactory pump that I know of is the Skidmore pump, which is mounted on a receiving tank and which has a vacuum pump for drawing out the condensate, and a feed pump which pumps the condensate back into the boiler.\n\nFather Mulvihill has talked about the installation of a mechanical stoker, but at the moment it would not be possible for him to get ready to put the stoker in before the cold weather is here. For one thing, the distance between the floor and the bottom of the boiler drums is not sufficient to permit stoker being installed. The only way that this could be done would be to dig a water-proof pit two feet minimum below the existing floor. By this means the combustion chambers of the boiler would be big enough to burn the amount of coal which the stoker would supply. These boilers are fired, one with coal and the other with wood. Natural draft is used.\n\nVentilation:\n\nThere are two large ventilators on the roof. These ventilators are piped from the various rooms, such as toilets, dormitories, etc. The main ventilators are supposed to revolve with the wind so that proper ventilation can be obtained. We found on examining these, however, that the ventilators could not turn and, probably, have not turned for years, as the wheels on which they are supposed to revolve were rusted and had evidently never been greased or oiled since they were put in. I would suggest that the existing wheels be removed and that wheels with ball-bearings be installed in their stead. With such an arrangement the wind would be able to turn the ventilators, and we are of the opinion that proper ventilation could be obtained. If this is not sufficient, then we would suggest that exhaust fans be placed in each of these ventilators which are about three feet in diameter inside. An 18\" exhaust fan would be ample (1 for each ventilator).\nWater Supply:\n\nThis water is pumped from Fraser Lake to an elevated tank about 2,100 feet distance from the pump to the tank. The school at which the pump connection is taken off is about 1,200 feet from the pump and 900 feet from the tank. The total head from the pump to the tank is approximately 102'. A pressure of about 40 lbs. is maintained at the school.\n\nWith regard to the statement that some of the pipes were paper thin, this, as far as we can see, only applies to two or three small pieces of pipe. These places, particularly where galvanized pipe is used, have been allowed to leak slightly and corrode. In any event, we do not think these places are numerous. The only thing to do is to replace them with black iron pipes when leaks show up.\n\nIt will be noted that the water is slightly acid.\n\nYou will note on the plans that there are two tanks which were installed for domestic hot water. These tanks are not in use, and the domestic water is heated by two water jackets and two vertical tanks. The suggestion is made that these tanks, which are now in use, should be removed from their present location and installed in the place which is now used as a coal bunker. There are also in the same place two large tanks which are not in use.\n\nThe idea is to get a larger bunker in which to store coal. As it is now, the coal is dumped just outside the boiler-house with a wooden shed covering it. This wooden shed we consider a fire hazard, and should certainly be removed. As a matter of fact, we have noticed in all the schools that wooden stacks are built in close vicinity to the school. We believe that the Department should take the necessary steps to see that this is not done in the future, and that the existing ones are removed.\n\nThe blue prints enclosed herewith show exactly how the pipe for the heating system should be installed, but, as stated previously, it has been so messed around by one and another that no one seems to know here it is.\n\nWith regard to the eliminators in the boiler room. We would say that these connections are practically as shown on the blue prints, with the exception of the fourth one from the left, which is 15\" higher than the others. As stated previously all these so-called air pipes should be removed and a vacuum pump installed, when the trouble with the heating system would cease.\n\nPlease note that the pump on the edge of the lake which pumps water to the elevated tank, as heretofore mentioned, is old and should be renewed.\n\nThey have at present one 10 k.w. one 2-1/2 k.w., and one 4-1/2 k.w. generator. The small generator has a burnt-out bearing, but we understand from Father Mulvihill that a new bearing has been ordered, and as soon as it arrives it should be put in working order.\nDecember 1, 1948.\n\nMr. Robert Howe,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nWe have recently received the report of the Donald Inspection Limited on the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nAttached are two copies of extracts from their report.

That first aid fire extinguishers be thoroughly checked and serviced.\n2. That the main interior stairways be fully enclosed.\n3. That access to the metal fire escapes be at floor level and through standard doorways.\n4. That the outside fire escapes be protected from the weather. (At the time of inspection, certain of the escapes were useless owing to the heavy deposit of ice.)\n5. Either properly protect or seal off the dumb waiter.\n6. Install a direct means of egress from the following classrooms to the fire escapes:\n\n   Primary\n   Grade 3 and 4 classroom\n   Grade 2\n   Senior Classroom\n\nThis may be accomplished by partitioning off the Hallway at each end of the building and installing additional doorways from the classrooms where required to give access to the fire escape opening.\n\n7. The present means of escape from the High Dormitory (girls) which at present is through the supervisors room, should be altered to allow a direct access to the escape.\n8. That the escape facilities from the North Dormitory (girls) be increased by installing an additional fire escape to lead directly to grade.\n\n9. That the present furnace chamber be equipped with a standard fire door and standard fire door hardware.\n\n10. That the boiler in the Laundry room be enclosed in a standard furnace chamber.\n\n11.

S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nExtract from report of Inspector Davey on the Lejac Residential School dated October 20th and 21st, 1948. Original on file 881-6.\n\nThe dormitories are definitely overcrowded and in two of these several double deck beds of the type formerly used by the army are in use. It is believed that the authorized enrolment at this school should be only 150. The construction of a day school at Ft. St. James which is proposed for the coming fiscal year will help to relieve the demand for admissions to this residential school and it is hoped, reduce the enrolment.\nOttawa, December 4, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Director,\nLands and Development Services Branch\n\nRe: Lejac Residential School - Donald Inspection Company Report\nRef: Your I.A. 1772-2 of November 23\n\nA careful study of this report would indicate that the main problem in this school is the installation of a new heating system. The other two problems, namely, those of ventilation and water supply would seem to be capable of local repairs providing the necessary instructions were issued.\n\nI would like to recommend that a meeting be held in the near future with officials of our Education Division and of your Engineering and Construction Service in order that a decision can be reached as to the best way of bringing this school into an effective state of repair.\n\nIt would also seem necessary to include a sum in our 1949-50 Supplementary Estimates for the carrying out of these repairs.\n\nActing Director.\nGORDON & BELYEYA LIMITED\nWHOLESALE HARDWARE AND SHIP CHANDLERY\nBuilders' Hardware, Sporting Goods, Mechanics' Tools, Electrical\nEngineering, Logging, Mill, Mine and Waterworks Supplies\n101 POWELL STREET\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nDATE OF INVOICE JAN 10/49\n\nSOLD TO:\nDOMINION GOVERNMENT DEPT MINES & RESOURCES\nR HOME INDIAN AGENT\nVANCOUERHOOF BC\n\nDATE SHIPPED\n\nTERMS:\n\n2 30 NET 13 10\n\nOUR INVOICE NO. 9658\n\nYOUR ORDER NO.\nYOUR S.T.L.

In this connection, he is referring to a 10 K.W.

The Reverend Principal advises that this is all the School management can do towards meeting the Fire Marshall's recommendations.\n\nMr. E. Hann, a local building contractor and myself, inspected the proposed alterations recommended by the Fire Marshal and it is our opinion they are extensive, intricate and costly, and would require the services of a fully qualified Construction Engineer.\n\nRegarding item No. 8 - installation of new fire escape in the Girl's North Dormitory. If this is necessary, then another escape should be installed in the Boy's North Dormitory, which is similar to the Girl's Dormitory.\n\nI understand that new steel fire escapes are very difficult to obtain. It has occurred to me that second-hand equipment of this nature may be obtained from the old Hotel Vancouver, which is now under demolition. Mr. C.E.

You will note that an official of this Division will visit Lejac as soon as his other duties will permit.\n\nBernard F. Neery,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nPP/ST\nAttach.\nOttawa, March 17, 1949.\n\nRe: Lejac Indian Residential School,\nStuart Lake Agency, B.C.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of February 24th, 1949, and to previous memoranda from Major MacKay bearing your notations in connection with the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nWe have reviewed and considered the correspondence and reports received from Mr. Webb's office early last year on which Indian Affairs took no action and the Donald Inspection Company report prepared as part of their assignment last fall. Conflicting opinions as to the condition of the heating system and the proposed remedies, raise doubts regarding the technical value of the recommendations.\n\nMr. Unsworth's report dated June 8th, 1948, states that the piping is of good design. This is not borne out by his detailed description of the distribution system and the application of various traps and other accessories. In one instance, it is stated that \"thermostatic traps are used to drip the ends of various steam mains. Such traps are not considered satisfactory for this application.\"\n\nIn a letter dated July 13th, 1948, to the Donald Inspection Company, we requested them to have their inspecting engineer clarify and amplify several phases of the work in connection with the heating system. Their report is along general lines and the specific questions raised in our letter, are not dealt with. However, their engineer describes the system to be \"messed up so that nobody seems to know where it is\".\n\nFrom a study of the Unsworth and Donald Inspection Company's reports, we gather that the system is a complicated arrangement of several composite designs, and that in itself would indicate faulty distribution and unequal heating.\n\nIt is our considered opinion that the reports are inconclusive and that in spite of the amount of information received, many essential data are lacking. As a consequence, it is not possible to offer recommendations which would correct the present installation.\n\nIt can be expected however, that as the system has been installed for twenty-five years and taking into consideration that during this time, it has given a great deal of trouble, nothing short of major changes can be expected to bring about an improvement.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIt is felt that in order to make an intelligent recommendation, an officer from this Division should be sent to the school as soon as he can be spared from the office for the required time. As the situation stands at present our one heating engineer has just returned from an inspection trip of residential schools at Sioux Lookout, Saginaw, Marie and Kenora, which occupied his time for as long as his office duties permitted him to be absent from Ottawa.\n\nAs you are aware, priority projects, such as the work on the Wabasca Residential School, the Bay Lakes Residential School, and heating designs for other Indian Affairs and Parks buildings, present difficulties in assigning this officer to distant inspections at any particular time, a situation we hope to remedy as soon as additional assistance can be obtained.\n\nThe matter has been discussed with officers of the Indian Affairs Branch, who realize that the western inspections they have requested must be fitted into our programme to the best advantage.\n\nWe will endeavour to make the best arrangements we can, but we are unable at present to say just when the inspections will be carried out.\n\nChief Engineer.\nStuart Lake Agency,\nVanderhoof, B.C.,\nMarch 17th, 1949.\n\nChief, Education Division, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to your inquiry of March 3rd, 1949, regarding Purchase Order No. 35421 - Stoker, etc. for Lejac I.R.

The Stellako and Endako Rivers, which are the chief sources, flow into the lake from the west. Water from Ormonde Lake enters the north side of the lake at a point opposite the Le Jac school. The Nechako River drains the lake at its west end. Fraser Lake is approximately 12 miles long and has an average width of 1\u00bd miles.\n\nDescription of Water System\n\nGeneral - the water system was installed in 1923 one year after construction of the school was completed. Water flows by gravity from the lake through a system of pipes and settling chamber to the pumphouse well and is then pumped through a main to an elevated storage tank. Water used at the school is tapped from the main and received on the first floor of the school at an average pressure of approximately 48 p.s.i.\n\nIntake - water enters the screened intake through 207 ft. of 8-inch iron pipe and then flows through 18 ft. of 10-inch by 10-inch wooden box pipe to a timber settling chamber. The chamber is 16 ft. long, 5 ft. wide, and 8 ft. deep and is composed of two 8 ft. sections in series. After having the heavy sand particles removed by the settling chamber, the water passes through 32 ft. of 8-inch iron pipe to a concrete well located below the pumphouse. Water can rise in the well to a maximum depth of 13 ft. without flooding.\n\nPumphouse - the 10 ft. by 14 ft. pumphouse is of frame construction on a concrete foundation. Pumping equipment includes one 10 H.P. Fairbanks Morse horizontal gasoline engine, belt connected on each of its sides to two 3\u00bd\"\u00d76\" stroke, double-acting, horizontal Fairbanks Morse pumps which are rated to deliver a total of 100 gallons per minute under a pressure of 100 p.s.i. Actual pressure during pumping varies between 66 and 73 p.s.i. depending on the elevation of the water in the storage tank.\n\nStorage Tank - Water is received at the elevated storage tank through 2,100 ft. of 4-inch wood stave main. The tank is supported by 21 ft. timber bents which sit on concrete pedestals that rise 2 ft. above the ground's surface. A 4-inch galvanized iron pipe connects the storage tank with the main. The tank is 16 ft. deep and 16 ft. in diameter, giving a storage capacity of 20,000 gallons.\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\n1. The Fraser Lake water supply appears to be of good chemical quality.\n\n2. The negative results obtained from the bacteriological analysis cannot be interpreted as meaning that the water supply is safe at all times of the year.\n\n3. The Stellacoo and Endeko Rivers are open to contamination but some natural purification by storage takes place since the supply intake is situated 5\u00bd miles from the rivers' entrance to the lake.\n\n4. It seems improbable that the current caused by the water's entrance to and exit from the lake would be strong enough to carry any appreciable amount of pollution to the school's intake.\n\n5. A regular shore line on the intake side of the lake aids in preventing the formation of stagnant water areas.\n\n6. Animals should be kept from grazing on the school's pasture land at the edge of the lake to minimize chance pollution from surface drainage.\n\n7. Bathing in the lake should not be allowed above a point located at least \u00bd mile from the downstream side of the intake.\n\n8. It is recommended that arrangements be made for taking water samples from the intake and water supply during the summer months for bacteriological analysis. The results of these will indicate the necessity or otherwise of disinfection of the supply.\n\nField Work by Mr. M.J. Stewart, Asst. Sanitary Engineer.\n\nA.H.

That tender was considerably higher than the amount we found possible to include in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50.\n\nThe amount we have available for the erection of a new barn is $12,000.00, and it would be appreciated if you would make immediate enquiries from the Reverend Principal with a view to ascertaining if he can supply any labour without cost to the Department.\n\nBovill & Hann in their letter referred to Beatty Bros. Plan AF.5937. If possible, we would like to receive a copy of this plan.\n\nFor your information, I may add that from reports received it is evident we will be obliged to spend a considerable amount of money at Lejac this year to improve the heating system.\n\n......2\nIt is for that reason in particular that Mr. Hargreaves intends to visit Lejac, as he is the heating engineer in the Lands & Development Services Branch.\n\nWe are advising Father Mulvihill that we have written to you, and that he will be hearing from you in the near future.\n\nBernard F.

We anticipate that it will be possible to make arrangements for a Western trip at the end of July, following the processing of plans and specifications necessary for carrying out the electrical work at Cape Croker Indian Reserve, together with other work pending which, we expect will be in hand and demand attention in the near future.\n\nIn connection with this proposed Western trip, it is noted in Major Mackay's memorandum to you of December 4th last, that the electrical system at Kootenay Residential School, is in need of attention and that the existing direct current battery charging generating system will be replaced by alternating current service, provided by the local power company. This will involve considerable work in rewiring and lighting improvements recommended by the Donald Inspection Company and, as indicated in Major Mackay's memorandum, an inspection and subsequent preparation of plans and specifications will be necessary.\n\nIt is our suggestion that this work be carried out in addition to any other investigations that the Indian Affairs Branch are considering in British Columbia at the same time our officer visits Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nChas.

Mulvihill\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe duly received your letter of the 10th instant, and we note that you are interested in two washers similar to the one which we supplied recently to St. John Hospital at Vanderhoof.\n\nYou mention that you will not need motors as you have a 5 HP DC electric motor on your old machines, and we are taking it for granted that you also have the necessary line shaft and belting which will be required to drive these machines from your motor. That being so, we are giving you the price on the washer itself, fitted with end header and suitable for belt drive.\n\nWe can supply you with two of these Canadian Globe Wood Washers with 36\" x 36\" Inner Cylinder for a price of $750.00 each, or $1500.00 for the two, Dominion Government Sales Tax of 8% included in the above price, F.O.B. Factory, Toronto.\n\nEach machine weighs approximately 1600 lbs., so that your freight on a total of 3200 lbs., which you would pay to the railroad in addition to the above price, should be approximately $220.00, as near as we can estimate it. You will be subject to the 3% Provincial S.S. & M.A. Tax payable on the F.O.B. factory price of $1500.00, and this would be shown as a separate item for Government purposes.\n\nWe can make shipment of these machines promptly from the factory.\n\nWe hope that you will be able to place the order with us, and you can rest assured we will give it our very best attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSTANLEY BROCK LIMITED\n\nW.

(RG 10, Volume 6445, file 881-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 7, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nLANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH\n\nRe: Lejac Residential School\n\nYour file I.A. 1772-2\n\nWe are in receipt of your memorandum of July 5th with reference to the recent inspection trip of your Heating Engineer.\n\nIt is noted that the improvements to the heating system at this school will necessitate the expenditure of $12,000. to $15,000.\n\nFunds for this purpose are available in the current year's appropriation, and it is hoped that you will find it possible to have the work carried out before the heating season commences.\n\nActing Director.\n\nPP/PM\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, July 5, 1949.\n\nRe: Lejac Indian Residential School,\nBritish Columbia.\n\nOn his recent inspection trip through British Columbia and Alberta, our heating engineer visited the above and surveyed the mechanical services.\n\nThe school is heated by a two pipe gravity low pressure vapour steam heating system, powered by two horizontal return tubular brick set boilers, each rated at 104 horsepower. These boilers are over 26 years old. Up till recently wood had been the principal fuel used, but some coal was burned last year which resulted in a slight improvement in the efficiency of the heating system. The use of coal even though hand fired, naturally brought about a somewhat steadier pressure.\n\nThe condensation is returned by gravity through a system of wet and dry return piping and is admitted to the boilers through combination air eliminators and boiler return trap. This combination is badly rusted and is not in satisfactory operating condition.\n\nThe piping connections at the boilers is of extremely poor design, resulting in a contribution to faulty circulation and unsteady water-line. The boiler shells, independently suspended by steel members, are in fair condition, but the brick work is in an exceptionally poor state of repair and the top covering of the exposed part of the shells, is practically non-existent.\n\nThe piping distribution system is more or less correctly laid out, to what is known as a vapour system, but is not the correct design for a building of this size. There are no traps at the end of the mains and branch mains. In lieu of traps, these mains are dripped at the end by means of bleeder connections into the wet return and in some cases by dry returns overhead back to the boiler return trap and it is this phase of the design which is responsible for a major part of the faulty circulation. In addition, run-out connections from risers to radiators and from mains and risers to first floor radiators, are all badly graded. This is due in part to the settlement of the building through the passage of time. These improperly graded run-outs and spring pieces form pockets where the condensation and air collect and circulation to the radiators is very difficult to obtain. When the pressure is raised in the boilers to overcome these conditions, short circuiting results, and the steam, taking the line of least resistance, travels back to the boilers through the return piping instead of passing through the radiators as it should.\n\nTo complete the picture, it is judged that 90% of the radiator traps and valves are defective, which also contributes to short circuiting in many areas.\n\nGenerally speaking the building is in a fairly good state of repair and appears to be well looked after especially on the inside.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThe domestic hot water service is inadequate to meet the needs of the pupils and staff. Two small jacket heaters and two domestic hot water storage tanks connected in series have capacities which are far short of the requirements.\n\nIt can be stated however, that in spite of previous pessimistic reports submitted in the past, the heating and domestic hot water systems are by no means so far gone that satisfactory revisions are impossible short of a complete re-installation. All the previous reports having been considered together with the survey carried out by our officer, would lead to the following recommendations.\n\n(a) Install some additional radiation where required.\n\n(b) Re-grade mains where necessary and re-grade all laterals and spring pieces to risers and radiators throughout the building.\n\n(c) Provide new float and thermostatic traps on ends of all steam mains and connect to return mains as will be detailed on drawing.\n\n(d) Provide new horizontal condensation pump to replace old and worn out boiler return trap and air eliminator assembly.\n\n(e) Make necessary piping revision at the boiler as will be detailed on drawing.\n\n(f) Provide one new steel portable fire box type low pressure steam heating boiler and make repairs to brick setting on remaining existing boiler.\n\n(g) Install new stoker (at present in storage at the school) under new boiler.\n\n(h) Provide new domestic hot water storage tank of 900 gal. capacity.\n\n(i) Provide new indirect steam fed heater consisting of cast iron shell and copper tubes with self contained regulating valve.\n\n(j) In addition to the above, it will likely be found that some sections of piping will have to be replaced as the work is in progress. This can only be determined when the work actually gets under way. Owing to the nature of this work and to the somewhat isolated location of this school, it is expected that contractors would be willing to submit a firm tender. It is felt that this particular work should be awarded on the basis of cost plus, which in our opinion, would result in a more favourable cost to the Department than a firm tender.\n\nThe foregoing recommendations can not be closely estimated, until the layout has been prepared, but it is felt that the sum of $12,000.00 to $15,000.00 will be required.\n\nUpon receiving approval and the instructions to proceed with the layout, we will prepare plans and specifications and call for tenders.\n\nChas. H. Buck,\nFor Chief, Engineering and Construction Division.\nAIR MAIL\n\nJune 22, 1949\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Lejack Indian Residential School\nYour File No. 14-11-3 (163)\n\nWe have your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing a requisition for certain equipment requested by the principal of the above school. We approve the purchase of 15 gallons of gray floor paint, as it is presumed that it is required for interior paint, and that the labour will be done by the school staff as you did not request any expenditure for labour.\n\nAs you mentioned in your letter, it is expected that Mr. Hargreaves report will recommend considerable expenditure. Consequently, it has been decided to defer action on the request for the range and the washers until we have received the complete report from Mr. Hargreaves.\n\nI suggest that you communicate with us again about the equipment by July 15th. At that time you might mention if the range or the washers should receive priority.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\n\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP: MMcN\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

Howe, reference his letter of June 6th and enclosure attached, has requisitioned for a new institutional range, two washing machines and 15 gallons of floor paint, which items are available at a cost of $2091.75.\n\nI understand from Mr. Hargreaves that fairly extensive changes and improvements are required to the heating system at Lejac and it may be that the Department will wish to first determine the cost of these changes before approving other expenditures but I would recommend that consideration be given to the attached requisitions at an early date as replacement of the range, installation of the washing machines and painting of the floors should be carried out during the months of July and August.\n\nW.S.

It would make a great difference in the warmth of the building this winter. If the Department would put through this part of the cost and furnish the insulation we could lay it ourselves.

Bovil & Hann, Contractors, Smithers, B.C., who submitted a tender which was forwarded to the Department with my letter of September 23rd, 1948, wherein the estimated total cost of the barn was approximately $16,000.00. This tender was not accepted due to no funds having been appropriated for this purpose for the 1948-49 fiscal year.\n\nHaving been advised that $12,000.00 had been appropriated for the 1949-50 fiscal year, tenders were again called for in the area; two were received, one from Bovil & Hann, Smithers, B.C., for approximately $19,000.00, and one from A.P. Anderson, Prince George, B.C., for approximately $20,100.00. The above figures include the cost of the steel barn equipment which was to be supplied by the Department at a cost of approximately $1,500.00. The above contractors have since advised that they could not start construction until 1950.\n\nThe B. & A. Power and Construction Company, of Vancouver, were asked to submit a tender, which has just been received, amounting to $23,522.00, plus the cost of the steel equipment.\n\nAs the above tenders are exceedingly high and as it is\nessential that construction be completed as soon as possible, the following alternative proposal is submitted for your consideration and approval:\n\n(1) Convert present piggery into a dairy barn and build silo.\n(2) Convert present implement shed into a granary.\n(3) Build new piggery.\n(4) Build new implement shed.\n\nOur Regional Supervisor, Mr. W.J. McGregor, investigated and discussed this proposal on the ground with Father J.P. Mulvihill and Superintendent Howe and he definitely recommends that it be carried out.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Superintendent Howe's letter of August 25th, 1949, and attached tenders and plans in duplicate submitted by Father J.P. Mulvihill, for remodelling the present piggery for use as a dairy barn, constructing new piggery, remodelling present implement shed for use as a granary and building new implement shed as well as a new silo, for the overall sum of $8,500.00, excluding steel barn equipment, which it is estimated will cost approximately $1,800.00, total expenditure of $10,300.00.\n\nFather J.P. Mulvihill is the Principal of the Lejac Indian Residential School at Lejac, a practical man, and we are confident that he can secure the necessary carpenters and labourers locally and that the construction can be carried out successfully, under the supervision of Superintendent R. Howe.\n\nThe Finning Tractor & Equipment Company, of Vancouver, are sending their Prince George representative to Lejac immediately. He will submit a complete quotation on the steel equipment and hardware which will be forwarded to the Department when received.\n\nIt is recommended that each of the enclosed tenders totalling $8,500.00 be approved and that $1,800.00 be set aside to cover the cost of the steel equipment. As little time remains for the completion of the concrete work prior to frost, I would appreciate receiving your instructions by wire as soon as possible.\n\nW.S.

Arnell, Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, B.C. Of the three firms invited to bid on this work, only two were in a position to submit a price. The prices received are as follows:\n\nMitchell Brothers Limited,\n1990 Burrard Street,\nVancouver, B.C. .................. $26,923.00\n\nBarr and Anderson Limited,\n1060 Homer Street,\nVancouver, B.C. .................. $28,300.00\n\nEach of these firm tenders was accompanied by a security deposit for ten per cent (10%) of the tender price in accordance with the requirements of the tendering documents.\n\nThese prices are considerably higher than our rough estimate of $12,000.00 to $15,000.00 mentioned in our memorandum of July 5th. After the complete analysis of field notes and inspection data had been made, it became apparent that more extensive operations would be involved than originally anticipated, if the mechanical services were to be brought up to acceptable standards.\n\nThis added work, together with the remote location of the school, which involves unusual transportation difficulties, would in a large measure account for the difference between our estimate and the lowest tender of $26,923.00.\n\nIt is felt that if the Indian Affairs Branch decide to proceed with this work, consideration should be given to Mitchell Brothers Limited tender. If advised that this work is to be undertaken, we will prepare a Memorandum to Council and Contract Agreements and will arrange to have operations started.\n\nR.A.

With my letter I submitted quotations on 2\" Rock Wool, which is the thickness asked for by the Principal and, as a matter of fact, we are not aware that there is such a thing as 3/4\" insulating batts; these come in 2\" and 3\" sizes and in British Columbia, there is very little demand for the 3\" size.\n\nWe have been informed of previous instances where the Purchasing Agent requested Vancouver firms to quote on materials which were already covered by quotations to this Office, which quotations were forwarded to you, and it appears to me that we are wasting not only our time but the time of local firms if the quotations secured by us are not acceptable to the Purchasing Agent, as a basis for the issuance of a Purchase Order. I should like to be advised if in future we should secure quotations on materials, the ordering of which must necessarily be referred to the Purchasing Agent, or if we should leave it to him to call for tenders. In the case of the Insulation for the Lejac School, I have suggested to the Reliance Lumber Company that they quote to the Purchasing Agent on 3\" Battts.\n\nfor W.S.

Mulvihill, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nLejac Indian Residential School,\nLejac, B.C.\n\nLejac Indian Residential School\n\nDear Father Mulvihill:\n\nAs you are probably aware, I have been absent from my office inspecting schools and am just now beginning to answer some of the accumulated correspondence.\n\nI was sorry to read of the difficulties encountered in securing tenders for the erection of the barn and Father Birch spoke to me about your tender. (Since withdrawn due to the lateness of the season.)\n\nWhen I last discussed this matter with him, I suggested that we prepare a bill of materials for the building which you intend to erect. This requisition could be submitted through Mr. Arnell to here and we could get the Departmental Purchasing Agent to work on it immediately. I presume that all of the materials, with possibly the exception of the cement, could be stored at your school until spring permits erection of the barn.\n\nWe will include an amount for labour in our next year's Estimates so that, with the materials on hand, work can begin early in May or as soon as weather conditions permit.\n\nI would suggest the hiring of a foreman carpenter as was done by Father O'Grady at Kamloops. With the materials already on hand, the building could then be erected without delays.\n\n......2\nduring the spring and summer.\n\nI am sending copies of this letter to both Mr. Howe and Mr. Arneil so that they will be aware of our plans. In fact, we would like to expend as much as possible of the funds available for this project before the end of the fiscal year and naturally the best way to do this is by the purchase of all materials.\n\nIn fact we could order the cement for delivery by the 20th of March and still be within this year's vote.\n\nI understand that the Lands and Development Services Branch have just made a submission to Council recommending the acceptance of the lowest tender submitted by the firms bidding on the revisions and additions to the plumbing and heating at this school. This amounts to very close to $27,000.00 and should put your school in good condition. With regard to the other items, I believe that Purchase Orders have been issued for the potato peeler, the two laundry washers and the commercial range.\n\nBernard F.

This requisition should also include such items as electrical wiring, hay chute, stanchions, aluminum sheet roofing, insulation, drinking bowls, litter carrier, etc.\n\nI would suggest that the requisition be divided into separate sections covering the following items:\n\n(a) lumber and building materials\n(b) standard hardware\n(c) barn hardware such as drinking bowls, stanchions, etc.\n(d) paint\n\n.....2\nIn this way the Purchasing Agent will be able to approach directly the firms who will wish to tender on these various projects.\n\nBernard F.

Neary\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThank you for your letter of Nov. 5th. I did not know that you were absent on an inspection tour until I received your letter.\n\nYesterday I was speaking to Mr. Howe and he suggested that I should write to you and have this point clarified. The materials to be purchased\u2014Are they for the plan that I suggested in my tender or for a new barn? I think that it would be a great deal cheaper to build according to the plan I submitted and also it would be more servicable to the school.\n\nI had already drawn up a list of materials for this project and if it is the mind of the Department then I will submit this list to Mr. Howe and discuss the matter with him. I am firmly convinced that this plan of building will be of greater service to the school.\n\nMr. Kosmar, the electrical engineer, has just completed a survey of the building. He feels that we should not install a stoker in the proposed heating boiler until some changes are made in the electrical system. Things get more complicated as we go along.\n\nI was very pleased to hear that there would be some action on the heating system. However the tenders seem to be very high.\n\nThank you for all your kindness and attention.\n\nYours very truly\n\nJ.P.

Howe\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Lejac Indian Residential School,\nLejac, British Columbia.\n\nIn connection with Major MacKay's memorandum of December 7th bearing your marginal notation of the 8th instant you are advised as follows:\n\nMr. Webb brought up the question of re-locating the boilers in his letter of November 25th and we replied on December 2nd fully explaining our reasons for locating the new boilers in the position shown on our drawings. It would appear that Mr. Webb's response to our letter has been directed to Major MacKay through Mr. Arneil.\n\nWe have wired Mr. Webb pointing out that boiler manufacturers' drawings must be submitted for approval by this office before the units are shipped. We have specified the type and capacity of the boilers required for this work and any proposed changes should of course be submitted to this Division for final analysis and approval before being proceeded with.\n\nAn examination of the original building plans shows that insufficient fuel storage and boiler room space was provided in the original design and there is evidence that a change was made at a later date in an attempt to improve the situation. Owing to the character of the building as now constituted, major basic changes to the structure involving an unwarrantable sum of money would be necessary in order to bring the fuel storage facilities up to a reasonable capacity.\n\nTherefore it is highly important from our viewpoint that no encroachment of the boiler room itself be made without approval from this Division which can only be given following a full consideration of all features involved.\n\nWhen the boiler manufacturer's drawings have been received and analyzed, we will be in a position to judge whether or not it will be possible to re-locate these units closer to the rear wall of the boiler room. At such time you will be further advised.\n\nChief, Engineering and Construction Division.\n\nR.A.

It will be permissible to move the boilers back\ndependent upon proper erection of the smoke breeching. This\nis detailed on the accompanying sketch. Please note that the\nminimum distance from the rear wall to the back of the boiler\nbase is 79 inches and that the inside radius of 30 inches on\nthe bend of the smoke breeching must not be altered.\n\nWe note that the new position of the boilers will\ninterfere with the piping as shown on our design, however,\nany changes in this piping must be carried out within the\nscheme shown in the isometric detail.\n\nYour letters infer that boiler room space is to\nbe used for coal storage.

Webb.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR\n\nLejac Indian Residential School,\nLejac, British Columbia.\n\nFurther developments in the matter as to boiler location in the revisions now being effected at the above school, have led to our final decision as noted in the attached copies of our letter to Mr. Webb. Also attached are copies of our letter to Mr. Arneil. One copy of each is for transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nChief.\n\nMajor MacKay:\n\nThe attached for your information.\n\nDirector,\n4-1-50\n3 January, 1950.\n\nLejac Indian Residential School,\nLejac, British Columbia.\n\nEnclosed is a copy of our letter to Mr. Webb for your information. May we add that any money that the Principal intended to spend on making a coal storage bin in the boiler room might better be spent in putting the original fuel storage room back into commission.\n\nUnauthorized construction is not only hazardous but generally poorly planned. It is plainly evident that this is the reason that the original fuel storage room is not being used as such today.\n\nC. Victor F. Weir,\nChief.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nPost Office Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nEncl.\nAIR MAIL\n\n3 January, 1950.\n\nLejac Indian Residential School,\nLejac, British Columbia.\n\nYou will have received our Army Message of the 23rd of December last which, in the main answers your letter of the same date.\n\nHaving full boiler data for the above project, we now are able to furnish definite comment regarding boiler location. It will be permissible to move the boilers back dependent upon proper erection of the smoke breeching. This is detailed on the accompanying sketch. Please note that the minimum distance from the rear wall to the back of the boiler base is 79 inches and that the inside radius of 30 inches on the bend of the smoke breeching must not be altered.\n\nWe note that the new position of the boilers will interfere with the piping as shown on our design; however, any changes in this piping must be carried out within the scheme shown in the isometric detail.\n\nYour letters infer that boiler room space is to be used for coal storage. It appears that due to changes and allocation of space by the school officers to purposes other than intended, and whereby considerable fire hazard has already been created, no alternative exists, unless steps are taken to restore the original fuel storage room to its proper use. We must state emphatically that we do not approve of any encroachment on the boiler room space.\n\nThe above and the fact that 11'-0\" must be left clear in front of the boilers to permit withdrawal of the stoker worm, should be brought to the attention of those concerned.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch and W.S. Arneil, will receive copies of this letter.\n\nC. Victor F. Weir,\nChief.\n\nC.E.

(RG 10, Volume 6445, file 881-5, part 10)\nDuring our exchange of correspondence with regard to the necessity for an additional generating unit at the Lejac School or alternatively the repair of the S.H.P. Lister previously used, either the school management or Superintendent Howe shipped the S.H.P. plant to Hoffers Ltd. and presumably instructed them to submit an estimate of the cost of overhauling the unit. Due to some misunderstanding, however, the Company proceeded with repairs and when Mr. Kosner, Electrical Engineer from the Land and Development Services Branch, made inquiries about the plant it was found that the repairs had been completed.\n\nWe are not aware of what Mr. Kosner intends to recommend in regard to the electrical requirements of the school, but the Lister plant is now in good shape and if not required at Lejac can possibly be traded in on a larger plant if necessary or used elsewhere, in view of which I would recommend payment of Hoffers' account as covered by Voucher No. 174 attached.\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, on the assumption that you will wish to maintain this crossing, also attached, in triplicate, is Agreement for New License, indicating the new rental.\n\nIt will be appreciated if you will arrange for this latter document to be signed in the space provided on the Form and return prior to the termination date of existing License.

I will be able to secure the services of an expert carpenter who has just completed a school for the Provincial Government in this district. I would employ local labour and quite a lot of work could be done by the boys as a manual training programme. This would cut the cost of construction considerably.\n\nYou have a copy of the details of construction sent to your office last Autumn. These details would be under the supervision of Mr. Howe.\n\nWould it be possible to start the construction and submit vouchers for the pay-roll. If the money is not available yet could I pay it from school funds and be reimbursed later on when the vouchers are presented. This should all go through Mr. Howe's office.\n\nIf this plan is acceptable would you let me know as soon as possible.\n\nI wish to thank you for the generous increase in the per capita grant.

Robinson. You will note that the Rev. Principal of the school took it upon himself to issue instructions to the contractor which prevented him from completing the work. I am writing to Father Mulvihill informing him that he has exceeded his authority in this regard and that the changes presently being made to the boiler room by the school management must be discontinued until his proposals are submitted to us in detail and approved but in the meantime I feel that it would only be reasonable to consider Mitchell Brothers contract as satisfactorily completed.\n\nI might mention that the Rev. Principal notified us by wire on March 23rd that the 13 valves and traps referred to in Mr. Martin's memorandum were installed.\n\nThe work of which the Principal has relieved the contractor of responsibility consists of:\n\n(1) Patching the holes in the walls\n(2) Painting of hot water storage tank and heater.\n(3) Closing of opening in wall of boiler room.\n\n(Sgd) W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nMemorandum to Mr. Arneil:\n\nRe: Lejac Indian Residential School Inspection Report\n\nAttached is a memorandum by Mr. R.M. Martin based on his recent inspection of the mechanical services revision at the above mentioned school now being carried out by Mitchell Brothers of Vancouver.\n\nYou will note that there are four parts of the work that are not completed. Three of these, namely, 1st, patching of the holes in the wall, 2nd, painting of hot water storage tank and heater, 3rd, closing of opening in wall of boiler room, should have been completed.\n\nAs on a previous inspection, Mr. Martin had left instruction with the Contractor to have these repairs made as they fall within the scope of the Contract. However, the Principal of the institution had, on his own responsibility, made arrangements with the Contractor that he would look after this work. Although there is probably nothing serious in this arrangement, it is certainly a practice that should be discouraged. This type of interference prevents the inspecting engineer from making a concise report on final inspection and leads to general dissatisfaction and misunderstanding between the inspector and the Contractor.\n\nYou will also note that the Principal of the school is carrying out alterations to the boiler room. I am not aware on what authority these alterations are being made, but in this particular instance the alteration will interfere with removal of the coal stoker worm provided the coal bin, which is now being built, is full or only partially full of coal.\n\nAs a general rule it would not be advisable for the local school authority to make changes or alterations to these buildings without first referring the subject to some authority on such matters.\n\nEnc. (Inspection Report) (Sgd) Norman P. Robinson\nMarch 23, 1950.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Robinson:\n\nRe: Lejac Indian Residential School\nInspection Report\n\nOn March 21 I made an inspection of the heating installations put in by Mitchell Brothers Limited.\n\nThis contract is now complete except for the following:\n\n(1) Patching of holes in walls.\n(2) Painting of hot water storage tank and heater.\n(3) Closing of opening in wall of boiler room.\n(4) Installation of 13 valves and traps in the sleeping quarters.\n\nAn arrangement has been made between the contractor and the Father in charge of the school for the Father to complete the first three items.\n\nThe 13 valves and traps were to be installed on March 22 and the Father will notify this office by wire when this is done.\n\nIn addition to the contract, the following extra work has been satisfactorily completed.\n\n(1) Installing 8\" main steam valve.\n(2) Installing by-pass system on condensation pump.\n(3) Installing condensation drip line in laundry corridor.\n\nAt the present time the Father is carrying out alterations in the boiler room. A coal bin is being constructed with concrete walls. There is a wall being constructed just clear of the hopper of the stoker with an opening for withdrawal of the worm. If the bin is full of coal, difficulty would be encountered removing the worm. It is the intention of the Father to close the existing boiler room entrance on the outside wall. I do not think it wise to do this.\n\n(Sgd) R.M.

Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDevelopment Services Branch,\nDepartment of Resources and Development,\nNorlite Building, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nRe: Lejac Indian Residential School\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of April 4th in which you mention that the Principal of the above school made certain changes in the boiler room layout without receiving approval.\n\nOn receipt of your letter, the following telegram was sent to the Principal on April 20th:\n\n\"We are informed you are making alterations to boiler room Lejac School. Would appreciate your advising immediately your reasons for proceeding with work without first securing official authority. Structural alterations to government owned buildings should not be made without first receiving our approval.\"\n\nToday we received the following reply:\n\n\"Retell what constitutes structural change. If building a coal bin in unused part of furnace room without change to foundation or walls is structural change, then I have overstepped regulations. This work completed three weeks ago. Commissioner told me to stop March 27th work completed then. Letter following.\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nLejac Indian Residential School\nUnder Direction of The Oblate Fathers\nLejac, B.C.\n\nApril 20th 1950\n\nMr. B.F. Neary\nSupt. of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nIn further reference to your telegram of April 20th, I wish to quote the last paragraph of Mr. Arneil's letter of March 27th. \"I NOTE ALSO FROM MR. MARTIN'S REPORT THAT YOU ARE CARRYING OUT CERTAIN ALTERATIONS IN THE BOILER ROOM. THE LEJAC SCHOOL IS A DOMINION GOVERNMENT BUILDING AND NO ALTERATIONS MAY BE MADE THERETO WITHOUT SPECIFIC AUTHORITY FROM THE DEPARTMENT. I HAVE THEREFORE TO REQUEST THAT YOU DISCONTINUE THE WORK AND IN THE MEANTIME PROVIDE COMPLETE DETAILS OF THE CHANGES YOU PROPOSE IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY BE REVIEWED BY OUR ENGINEERING STAFF.\"\n\nI replied to this letter on March 28th stating, \"IN YOUR LAST PARAGRAPH YOU ADVISE ME TO DISCONTINUE THE WORK ON THE COAL BIN. THAT WORK HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND I AM ENCLOSING A SKETCH OF THE WORK DONE. THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGES MADE TO THE FOUNDATIONS NOR HAVE ANY PARTITIONS BEEN REMOVED. THERE HAD TO BE SOME PROVISION MADE FOR COAL STORAGE, SO FAR IT HAS BEEN PILED OUTSIDE IN THE YARD OPEN TO THE WEATHER AND A GREAT EYESORE.\"\n\nI do not know what report Mr. Martin made to the Department but it seems to me to be greatly exaggerated from all the excitement it is causing. I waited two years from the time Mr. Unsworth made his recommendations for changes in the heating system until the work was started. If I had to wait two years more for a simple matter of a coal bin it would be ridiculous.\n\nAccording to Mr. Arneil's letter no alterations can be made without specific authority from the Department. Does this mean that a floor cannot be repaired or a wall painted without specific authority from the Department? I brought Major Davies down a few weeks ago to look at the coal bin and explain the matter to Mr. Arneil. He did not think that any grave breach of Red Tape had been made. I had intended to do some painting this summer and patch up walls where the plaster has fallen off. The cement floors in the basement need repairing but if this work has to be delayed by the Engineering Department there is little hope of having it done this year.\n\nThe work on the coal bin has been completed three weeks ago so there is nothing much I can do at present except await further developments.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.P.

Howe,\nIndian Office,\nVANDERHOOF, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am submitting a request for a new Lighting Plant for this school.\n\nWe have a 10 K.W. Plant at present but during the winter the Heating plant was changed and a 3 H.P. motor was installed on the stoker and a 3/4 H.P. on the return pump; this has placed too heavy a load on our present plant.\n\nWith the present installations and the number of lights in the building we need an 18 K.W. Plant to prevent overloading.\n\nThis building was inspected by an electrical engineer from the Department on November 11th, 1949, and his report will confirm this necessity. In fact he told me that he would not let them install the stoker with the present Plant but this did not take effect and the contractors installed the stoker.\n\nThis engineer investigated the possibility of a Power Line passing through this part of the country, but I have been informed by the Provincial Member of Parliament that this will not be in effect for some years yet.\n\nThe present Plant is a Vivian Diesel installment with 10 K.W. DC rating. For the most economical operation this plant can be used during the daytime when the load is light and an 18 K.W. plant operated at night when the load is too heavy for this smaller unit. Therefore, I think that a Vivian Plant would be the most suitable for the 18 K.W. unit. However the electrical engineer has all the data on this school and will be able to recommend the proper installment.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"J. P. MULVIHILL\"\nOttawa, June 13th, 1950.\n\nR.A.

Moore,\nIndian Agent,\nWanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHerewith I beg to submit the report for the quarter ending June 31st, 1938.\n\nHEALTH. The General health of the children has been very good. There have been two or three cases of active T.B. and the children were sent home at once.\n\nTrachoma. We were worried about the possible spread of this disease among the children but the report of Dr. Wahl was very encouraging. He finds a marked improvement among the children and feels that if the present treatment is continued, most of the children will leave the school practically cured.\n\nDiscipline. Apart from the restlessness at the approach of the holiday season, we are well pleased with the conduct of the children. There have been no runaways and the children seem quite contented.\n\nVISITS OF PARENTS. In previous reports I have called attention to the necessity of stricter regulations to control the visits of the parents and other Indians to the school. The Department approved of the regulations submitted for this purpose and I am glad to be able to report that since the regulations have been in force, we have had no trouble at all. All that is needed now in order to have complete control of this point, is a house near the school for Indians coming from a long distance during the winter. At present there is no building available except the railway station and I do not think that the C.N.R. officials take very kindly to the use of the station for this purpose.\n\nClassrooms. The program of studies has been followed closely and we hope that the Inspector will find that the matter covered has been well learned by the children. One of the great difficulties we have is to get the children to speak correct English. The majority of the children come to the School without knowing any English at all and the result is that the English spoken during recreation is so poor that the standard is lowered for the whole School. I believe that it might be well to suggest to the Inspector certain modification in the amount of matter to be covered during the school term, so that more time could be devoted to the teaching of correct speech. No doubt the Inspector has met this problem before and would be able to make practical suggestions.\n\nManual Training. We have not done as much this year in this Department as we had hoped. We only had about a dozen big boys altogether and by the time they had been divided up for the various works, it was extremely difficult to give the Manual Training Instructor sufficient time with each group. However, of the twelve big boys at least nine were able to learn a great deal about practical carpentry, cement and concrete work etc. Two of the boys have become quite proficient in this work.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6445, file 881-10, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDOMESTIC SCIENCE. As the girls are more numerous it has been easier to divide them into fairly large groups and the work has been very successful. To the usual program two new items have been added, the preparation of wool from our own sheep and the knitting of Indian woolen sweaters from natural wool prepared at the school. This is just a beginning. The girls are also learning to make mattresses from Sheep wool. This year we have had for this purpose about 250lbs of wool and as our flock increases, we hope to develop this branch of the training given to the girls.\n\nImprovements. We are expecting the final approval of the specifications for the new piggery and this work will be started as soon as the permission is given.\n\nWe are planning this year to make the grounds as attractive as possible. A nicely decorated gate has been built on the Highway and we are hoping to be able to plant trees and shrubbery from the Highway to the School. A great deal of fencing is being done and every effort will be made this summer to make the whole farm and the outbuilding look as neat as possible. Each year there seems to be an increase in the number of visitors during the summer months and the School is looked upon by many as a kind of experimental farm.\n\nAgriculture. A week ago it looked as if our crops were going to be a complete failure. We had no rain for ninety days and nothing was growing except the Alfalfa and it was beginning to turn yellow. However, we had a good heavy rain four days ago and things look more hopeful. It is doubtful if we shall be able to thresh any grain as the season is now very late and the oats and wheat are barely out of the ground. But we shall have plenty of green feed if we get a little more moisture.\n\nThe experience we have had this spring has naturally turned our thoughts to irrigation. We had already begun to build and install the necessary flumes to irrigate the potatoes when the rain came. Everyone agrees that in most years we could almost double our Alfalfa and other crops, if we had irrigation. The official statistics give the annual rainfall for the district as 12 inches, which means that the school is situated in what is known as the semi-arid part of British Columbia. This means that no matter how well we may prepare the land in the spring or no matter how good the seed may be, we cannot under normal conditions expect sufficient rain at the right time to guarantee a good crop. Our land is easy to irrigate, we have a huge lake at our front door, we have the water tank necessary for irrigation but we lack a pumping system sufficiently economical for the purpose. If it were possible to change our present pumping system and install a modern diesel engine, it would be easy for us to irrigate the whole farm at a very reasonable cost. Our present main costs $50 an hour to pump 100 American gallons a minute and I am told that the modern diesel engine could do the same or even better work for \u00a31.00 a day. It would be a big saving even in the cost of supplying the water required for the daily use of the School.\n\nThe various branches of the farm work are doing well. The Dairy, the poultry, the sheep and beef cattle are all helping to provide the school with good wholesome food and even the bees (we have twelve hives) are contributing their share. We have started in a small way to develop an interest in rabbits so that the children, when they leave school, will have seen the many ways in which they can help to provide food and recreation for themselves later on.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. W. Byrne-Grant, O.M.I.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nSir,\n\nUpon my recent visit to the Atlin end of the Agency, the affairs of the Davey Johnson Family was again gone into and found to be even worse than ever. Drink has been the ruination of this family.\n\nIn this family however are two children: Elizabeth age 10 years, very fine little girl, and clean - and her brother Dick age 7 years, also well worth saving. The older daughter has now two illegitimates, and the other children (three) are under school age.\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Bunoz O.M.I. has requested that the above two children be sent to LEJACK Indian School, and as the case is so drastic, your agent wishes to back up his application. These youngsters must be sent out of that district if more trouble is to be avoided as they grow up, and Lejack seems to be the only place to send them.\n\nTherefore, their papers were made out and signed by Dr Roth, M.D. of Atlin, who was warned to take every effort to find traces of T.B. He states they are clear and can be sent to school. The papers were then forwarded to His Lordship Bishop Bunoz, requesting him to forward direct to The Department, two copies and the third copy to be sent to this Office.\n\nThis copy has not yet arrived, no doubt His Lordship has not yet returned from his Yukon Inspection, but the other two copies might have arrived in Ottawa by now.\n\nThis is to request that authority be allowed at once to move these youngsters out of Atlin and to Lejack School, and that all necessary paper routine be caught up with at a later date. The reason for such hurry being that the Fall is fast approaching and transportation is shutting down.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSylvester Patrick, an Indian of the Fort Fraser Reserve, has approached me with the request that I take his two young children into the school. The children are Elizabeth, 6 years old, and Holland, about 5 years old.\n\nAs you are aware, Amelia Patrick, the mother of the children in question, died last May; so there is no one in the family who can give proper care to the children. Sylvester, of course, has to work and is away from home the greater part of the time.\n\nHowever, I told Sylvester that I would refer the case to you. At the present time we have 169 children residing at the school, $ over our per capita allowance; and there is the probability that this number will be increased by the return to the school of some of the children who did not come back after the holidays.\n\nNevertheless, I would be willing to accept these two children if the Department will give me some monetary assistance in taking care of them.

In this event you should forward the application form and certificate of health to the Department for our approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\nOttawa,\nNovember 17, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to the pupilage at the Lejac Indian Residential School.\n\nI note your recommendation that the pupilage be increased to 175. No provision was made in the current year's appropriation for this increase nor was it found possible to provide grant for an increased pupilage at this school in our estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40. However, if you consider that the two children of Sylvester Patrick require institutional care you may place them in the school provided the Principal has accommodation for them and is willing to accept them. Supernumerary grant will be allowed for these two children from the date of their admission to the end of June, 1939. At that time in view of pupils being discharged it should be possible to absorb them among the regular grant earning pupils. In the event of the children entering the school a special note should be made on the December, March and June returns quoting the date and file number of this letter authorizing payment of supernumerary grant for them.\n\nWith special reference to the second paragraph of your letter I am writing to Indian Agent Mortimer advising him that in future he should not apply for admission of children to the Lejac Residential School until he has first written to the Principal and ascertained if accommodation can be provided for them. This procedure will permit the Principal to first provide for the children from the Stuart Lake Agency.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.H. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nVanderhoof, B.C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nVanderhoof, B.C., November 3rd, 1938.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to bring the attention of the Department to the condition of affairs which exists at the Lejac Indian Residential School this year in so far as the number of pupils attending the school is concerned.\n\nAt present the school authorities receive a grant for 160 children while at the present time there are 168 there and several more who should be there and whose parents have asked that they be accepted. The point that I wish to bring to your attention is the system which exists at present whereby the Department authorises Agents of other Agencies to send children from their Agencies to school and which I know nothing about until after they arrive. I refer particularly to six or eight children whose applications for admission were sent in by Agent Mortimer and approved by the Department, and again in the case of Agent Reed of the Stikine Agency having received authority direct from the Department to send two children from his Agency down here.\n\nThe point is that these children from other Agencies come to school and owing to the fact that the school is not receiving a grant for a large enough number of the children of this Agency are being allowed, of necessity, to remain at home with their parents or guardians when they really should be at the school. The school authorities are not against taking a certain number of children over and above the number that they are given a grant for but it is unreasonable to expect them to take too many, especially as crowding is likely to result.\n\nPersonally I am of the opinion that we could handle comfortably at the school a maximum number of pupils totaling 175 and I feel that of that number the Department would only be doing the right thing to the school authorities, as well as the children themselves, if you could see your way clear to raise the per capita grant from 160 to 165. It is either a case of doing that or else not allowing children from other Agencies to go to the school unless the time arrives when this Agency cannot keep up the quota required.\n\nHaving this in mind I wish to attach hereto a letter received from the Rev. Principal which I trust you will find self explanatory. The two children of Sylvester Patrick mentioned in the Principal's letter should really be at the school, although one of them is only five years old. There was T.B. in this family on both of the parent's sides and while these children are perfectly healthy with no sign of T.B. it will only be a matter of time until they are affected unless properly cared for, and this cannot be done by their father alone and there are no suitable relatives on the father's side to look after them and certainly none on the mother's side.\n\nI would be greatly obliged if you would kindly give this question consideration and advise me fully on the subject. At the moment I am not taking any action in so far as these two children, mentioned by the Rev. Principal, are concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.H. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRHM/L.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

C.\nIn the Agency's Monthly Report for February, the sad case of the Davey Johnson Family of Atlin B.C. was mentioned. Therein is mentioned the fact that it was necessary to send two of their children to Lejack Industrial School in the Fall of 1936\u2014which turned out to be the correct action, to have been taken. Since then the mother with her twins have died, leaving the distracted father Davey Johnson with his eldest daughter and her three illegitimate children, and also the above very nice little lad\u2014on his hands to maintain.\n\nTherefore His Lordship Bishop Coudert, O.M.I., was asked if he would accept the lad at Lejack School, so that he could be there with his brother and sister\u2014providing of course that the Doctor in Atlin can pass the lad as entirely free from T.B., etc. His Lordship's reply was as follows:\n\n\"In regard to Davey Johnson's boy, I think for the time being it is certainly a wise move to have the said child sent to the Lejack School, providing his admittance is arranged by you with the Department, as I have nothing to say in the matter. I know that actually the school is crowded to capacity with an excess number of more than ten children; the Principal however will always be glad to harbour\u2014even free of charge, such orphans as the one you are referring to.\"\n\nThe Principal of the Lejack was also written to, explaining the matter to which no reply has as yet been received, but there is little doubt but what room will be made for the above lad, if required.\n\nTherefore may the necessary authority be granted for the above lad to be removed from Atlin B.C. and placed within the Lejack Industrial School. Such movement will take place when some white person from Atlin B.C. will be able to see the lad down to Prince Rupert, on their way to Vancouver B.C. for business purposes.\n\nThe necessary papers will of course have their due attention over the movement.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is understood, of course, that he will be pronounced physically fit before being sent to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek, B. C.\nSir,\n\nIn the Fall of 1932, whilst in Atlin B.C. an Indian youngster was found about the Town that was not on our Census. Going into this matter it was found that an Indian Telegraph Jack had brought him in by way of the Taku River - from Juneau, S.E. Alaska, with any authority what-so-ever.\n\nAn effort was made to send him back to Juneau, but the lad about 10 years old, was taken out into the bush for the winter. Later the Jack Family somehow or another managed to have Father A Allard then in charge of Atlin R.C. Missions, send the lad to Lejack School.\n\nAs far as is known no papers have ever been signed to cover this lad, as he was a U.S.A Citizen. Much correspondence has passed over the matter with the Lejack School Authorities, and no definite reply has been received as to if the papers were ever signed or not. Might this matter be looked into.\n\nTo day the School Authorities wish to return this lad to Atlin, and it is thought that any other place would be better than to that point. Really he should be returned to Juneau, where he would be able to follow up his training received at Lejack school. There will be nothing for him to do in Atlin and the fur trapping has nearly gone, with no more traplines for him to take up.\n\nIn the meanwhile the Mission have been requested to not return this Lad, until such a time as can be arranged. Mrs Telegraph Jack of Atlin claims to be the lad's Aunt, but it is thought he is an illegitimate, however there is a lot of drinking going on with the Jack Family, and no place for this lad to return to.\n\nI am,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources.\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nHarper\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 8, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 22nd ultimo, in which you submit for departmental consideration the case of a boy now enrolled at the Lejac Indian Residential School, who formerly entered Canada from Juneau, Alaska.\n\nIt is exceedingly difficult to state exactly what action should be taken with respect to the boy at this date. If he really came from Juneau, he should have been returned to that point at the time he was enrolled at the Lejac school. The school authorities should be prepared to accept some responsibility at this date for placing him in a reputable home.\n\nIf the school authorities know of no such home, would it be possible for you to communicate with a missionary or an Indian administrator in Alaska, asking if the relatives of the boy at Juneau would be prepared to accept him. If the Juneau authorities are not prepared to receive the boy, it will be somewhat difficult for you to ignore the claims of Mrs. Telegraph Jack for the custody of this boy. You should exercise your own best judgment in respect to the matter. Any recommendation you care to make will be acceptable to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

In this connection I would point out that even though she does this there are numerous free services such as medical attention and books that he will receive. In addition no child can be admitted to a residential school without the Department's approval.\n\nWe have already considered the case of this boy and he is not considered one of our wards. Therefore this Department is not responsible for his education. If principals were allowed to admit children who are not eligible as grant-earning pupils on the condition that those interested would pay for their maintenance it would have the effect of using accommodation in residential schools that is necessary for recognized Indian children.\n\nI feel certain that if you show this letter to the Principal of the Lejac residential school he will appreciate our position in the matter and have the boy returned to his mother immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.H.F.

Antoine of the Stony Creek Band of Indians. I have informed the Rev. Father A.R. Simpson, Principal of the Indian Residential School, at Lejac, of your ruling in the matter. He has informed me that before your reply was received the mother of the boy took him to the Indian School and agreed to pay for his maintenance there out of her monthly allowance from the boy's father. He states that the mother of the boy wishes to have him brought up in a Roman Catholic School and not in the Public School. He also points out that the boy would have to walk three miles to school at the Public School from his home on the Stony Creek Indian Reserve, which he considers too far for a boy of seven years.\n\nOwing to the fact that the Rev. Principal is asking for an additional grant to cover children already at the school over and above the number paid Per Capita Grant and that the father of the boy wishes to have him brought up in the Public School; I would not recommend that he be admitted to the Lejac Residential School but would respectfully request your further instructions in this case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJas.

The doctor was seen, and the lad has been passed as fit, having been under observation for over 6 months now.\n\nThe above authorities cover this movement, and all fares etc have been arranged, except that from Prince Rupert to Lejack, the cost of which is not known here. A warrant for this can be obtained from the Indian Office in Prince Rupert, which of course would be chargeable to this agency. A very nice lad\u2014Jnr Murray Junr is going to Prince Rupert also, and he has been paid some small amount to care for this indian lad en route down. Lejack has been requested to advise you of this movement, when they accepted this entrance to Lejack, in yesterday's \"wire\".\n\nIt is hoped that this meets with your wishes. No doubt Father De Heyser will be writing you also, on this matter, and also regarding the recent troubles of this Camp.

The lad leaves here tomorrow morning.\n\nFather O. DeKeyser, O.M.I., now here in Residence, with your Agent have gone into this matter very carefully, and despite the expenses involved, we shall in the long run save expenses by moving this very nice little lad, away from this rather rough mining camp of Atlin B.C.\n\nOver Xmas and the New Year, much trouble with the Indians has again come about, which will be reported in due course, and it is hoped that within a few days more, it will be possible to have all the Indians out again on their trap-grounds - and away from this Townsite.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.
