Our mother country had been in our native land for a whole century before Hogiest landed at Bristol in 679 A.D., and about 949. The Christian church had been in the country at the very last three centuries before Edwin, King of Mercia, became its first bishop. The bishops of the British church were consecrated at the Council of Arles in 313 A.D., showing that even then existed the church in Britain in a distinctly organized form. But it would be impossible in the mere space of an hour to give even by name the earliest names in the history of the church extending over more than fifteen centuries, if we were free from the necessity of taking in all those whose beliefs have been very varied subjects of interest in connection with it. In these few centuries of English church history there may be traced not only the decay of the Romanized state, but also the growth of national influences; and, indeed, though there was no such thing as a nationality, yet as a race there was definitely an English character in the formation of the church, and their common consciousness of belonging to the same people was seen in the unity of their opinions. It must be remembered that at first there was a great deal of misunderstanding between their Mercian and Saxon families of the most ancient lingoistic varieties which have been preserved from the primitive stage of our civilization. This is my body, this is my blood. The cardinal error of the primitive Christians of Spain had been accurately to define doctrines, that he early church in times will not see the lingoistic variations which exist in the primitive churches.\n\nWe may go back farther still in the history of the church and see that its continuity was maintained throughout the centuries of Roman occupation. The Romano-British church continued after the fall of Rome. This is made plain by the preservation of many inscriptions, coins, and other relics connected with the primitive Christians of that period. These primitive Christians of the seventh and eighth centuries are not merely the ancestors of the later Anglo-Saxon church, but are quite different in their religious ideas and traditions. The Anglo-Saxons were a warrior race, and their religious ideas were influenced by their military life. They were also a kind of savage people, and their religious ideas were influenced by the customs and superstitions of the savage. The Roman influence was weak and fading, and the Anglo-Saxon church was able to maintain its own independence. The Roman influence was strong, but the Anglo-Saxon church was not able to maintain its own independence. The Roman influence was strong, but the Anglo-Saxon church was not able to maintain its own independence. The Roman influence was strong, but the Anglo-Saxon church was not able to maintain its own independence.\n\nWe must not forget that the Roman influence was strong, but the Anglo-Saxon church was not able to maintain its own independence. The Roman influence was strong, but the Anglo-Saxon church was not able to maintain its own independence. The Roman influence was strong, but the Anglo-Saxon church was not able to maintain its own independence. The Roman influence was strong, but the Anglo-Saxon church was not able to maintain its own independence. The Roman influence was strong, but the Anglo-Saxon church was not able to maintain its own independence. The Roman influence was strong, but the Anglo-Saxon church was not able to maintain its own independence.\n\nWe see an entirely new order of service was adopted by the later imitators, for which there can be no excuse whatever. No one who speaks foreign languages can be made to believe that that which has ever been considered the highest act of prayer among the primitive Christians of the East, would have been considered simply as a change from the primitive, when made by the prayers of men of good intention. Now let us turn our attention to the particular matters of doctrine. For we must note that, while the faith of the church remains unaltered, the form of its church order is far from uniform throughout all its generations. We must therefore examine the various orders of service that have been current in the church. It is impossible to enumerate them all, but we may mention the following:\u2014\n\n1. The Reformation Liturgy.\n\n2. The Church's Liturgy.\n\n3. The Liturgy of the Primitive Church.\n\n4. The Liturgy of the Anglo-Saxon Church.\n\n5. The Liturgy of the Roman Church.\n\nAs these orders of service are very frequently mistaken for matters of faith, and often the wars of the church are merely struggles between different parties, so the church order is frequently the subject of controversy. The church order should be regarded as a part of the doctrine of the church. It is impossible to say how much importance should be attached to it, but we must remember that it is the substance of our faith that is concerned. We must also keep in mind the fact that the church order is not the same in all countries, although the substance of our faith is the same everywhere.\nOUR TERMS.\n\nWe have placed our yearly subscription at the low rate of One Dollar, with the object of enforcing advance payment.

A marriage in England is\nnot considered marriage; \"a young man of\nabout twenty-five who becomes engaged to a lady of say 18, and the lady remain\nthus engaged for three or even five\nyears.

On the day she leaves she\ndoes not expect to be there again. So\nthere is nothing but work and\nbusiness that keeps the poor woman\nin England for years. She does not\npretend to be lonely because she\nknows business keeps her occupied.\nHer husband's business is done for her. She\ndoes nothing for herself except work.\nWhen her husband dies an English\nwoman loses her husband and becomes a\nwidow. If she is unfortunate she\nbecomes a governess, housekeeper, or a\nmaid servant. When she is good\nshe gets a nice position as a governess\nor a housekeeper, but when she is\nglutton, she gets her husband's place\nwith the same wages and the same\njob. When she becomes a\nwidow she gets no pension but her hus-\nband's estate goes to others than the\nwidow. She must take care of\nherself and her child. If she chooses\nto send them away she must choose\nthe best school for the child.\n\nNOTICE.\nNotice is hereby given that an application will be made before\nthe North West Central Rail-\nway Company, the Canadian Pacific\nRailway Company, the Ottawa\nLachine Railroad Company, the\nGovernment of Canada, for an Act to incorporate the \"North West Central Railway Co., Ltd.,\" having such\npower and authority as a private railway\ncompany, to build a railroad in the\nProvince of Ontario and the Province\nof Quebec, and to sell and dispose of\nall property in case of insolvency,\nfor such purpose.\nT.
