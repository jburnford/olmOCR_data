This was due to the fact that after Crane's Heating Engineer had looked over the work he advised adding another section to the boiler to give a bigger body of water, as the boiler is situated at one end of the buildings. For the same reason he advised putting in a Thrush control system to help circulation. Also when the system was filled up the old work was found to be defective in many places and had to be overhauled generally.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sd) A.S.Hanna.\nWest Coast Agency,\nFort Alberni, B.C.\nFebruary 5th, 1930\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit herewith for the information of the Department, a copy of a letter from Mr. A.S.

SCOTT.\n\nWith reference to that portion of Bishop Murray's letter, which is concerning the Christie Indian Residential School, I may say that the buildings are not fireproof, nor are they very suitable for the purpose of educating Indian children. The original wing has been added to from time to time. On the other hand, I understand that this school is quite habitable yet and, in addition to improvements that the church may have effected, the Department has expended $17,240.00 during the last four years in enlarging the school, providing fire protection, installing water supply, electric light and heating equipment.\n\nThe following schools in British Columbia have as much, if not more, claim for new buildings as Christie:-\n\nSt. Mary's, Squamish,\nAhousaht, Cariboo.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOctober 6, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is quite necessary at Christie School that some kind of locker arrangement be made for keeping the clothes of the girls, that the present store room for food supplies be enlarged and generally improved, and that part of the floor of the laundry, recently burned away due to the collapse of the ironing and hot water stove, be replaced. The estimated cost of these repairs and improvements is $300.00. May I respectfully ask the Department to come to my assistance to that extent?\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nVictor Hassier, O.S.B.\nOttawa, October 18, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to repairs at the Christie Indian Residential School. The Department regrets that the Appropriation for Indian Education is entirely assigned for this fiscal year and that authority cannot be granted at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Victor Rassier, O.S.B.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Indian Residential School,\nKakawin, C.\n\nThere was some private correspondence. This was really forwarded.\nOttawa, May 18, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to your recent request for authority to expend approximately $500 for urgent repairs at the Christie Indian Residential School. The Department authorizes you to expend this amount for materials and, in this case, prefers you to pay the bills and to forward receipted accounts to the amount of our grant to Ottawa. Favourable consideration will then be given to reimbursement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Victor Rassier, O. S. B.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Indian Residential School,\nKakawis, B.C.\nEXTRACT from Report of G. H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B. C., regarding his inspection of the Christie Indian Res. School on September 2nd, 1931, and forwarded under cover of Commissioner Ditchburn's letter of September 16th, 1931.\n\nOriginal on File 159-0-6.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION:\n\nThe fire escapes consist of a wooden stairs and a wooden ladder attached to the back wall of the school. Neither of these is used for fire drill purposes. In fact, when I wanted to hold a fire drill I could not, as the children had not been drilled and would not have known what to do. I did my best to impress upon the Principal the necessity of teaching the children how to make their exit from the building in case of fire. I requested him to hold fire drills, at least once a month. I should be glad if the Department would impress on the Principal the absolute necessity of holding regular fire drills.\n\nThe exits to the fire escape and ladder are nailed. There is an axe in each dormitory. Two of the staff sleep in a room from which there is no proper exit in case of fire. Should they be cut off on the inside of the building, they could not escape. I am not satisfied with the facilities for escape in case of fire.\n\nI beg to recommend that a system of four fire gongs be installed at the earliest possible moment.\nOttawa, September 29, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nMr. School Inspector Barry is not at all satisfied with the facilities for escape in the event of fire at the Christie Indian Residential School. The most serious situation was the failure to have fire drill. This practice should be repeated regularly every two weeks, if not often, particularly at the beginning of the academic year and before the fires are used for heating purposes. Unfortunate experiences in the past have impressed upon the Department the absolute necessity of regular fire drill.\n\nTo facilitate fire drill and to improve the facilities for sounding an alarm, the Department wishes you to install fire gongs at the earliest possible opportunity. At other schools this equipment has been put in the buildings at a very moderate expense, and I have to request that you will ascertain what is needed and make the installation. A properly certified account, in duplicate, may be forwarded for the materials.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

This would necessitate the installation of two fire stations and two gongs on each floor where this division just mentioned exists. More than this I am not in a position to say. It would be necessary for me to visit the school and co-operate with Father Nassler as to the actual requirements. I would then be able to give your Department all the requirements in detail and the approximate cost.\n\nProvincial fire regulations call for such work being done in conduit with approved gongs and fire stations. I am familiar with the work as I have already installed fire alarm systems in three hotels in this city.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. C. Hamilton. (Sgd.)\n\nIndian Affairs.

C. Hamilton regarding the matter.\n\nIn reply I have to say that owing to the cost involved we are not prepared to authorize Mr. Hamilton to make a visit to the school and report on the work and materials required in installing the fire alarm system. It is thought that the Principal could have a lay brother or other member of the staff who would be competent state, in detail, the quantity of wire, gongs, etc., required and the cost of same. It is not intended that an elaborate system be installed, and the work could be carried out by the school authorities themselves after the materials were supplied.

C. Hamilton, Fort Alberni, B.C., for materials for fire alarm system for Christie School.\n\nJune, 1932.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 159-0-5 dated Ottawa May 25th, 1932.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nKamloops, B.C., July 30th, 1932.\n\nWEST COAST AGENCY INSPECTION REPORT.\n\nCHRISTIE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI also landed there and went over this school. The locality of this building also, is about as poor as could be chosen from the point of view of landing freight. The Rev. Principal, who was not there at the time of my visit, possesses a wharf, but from what I can make out, this is entirely unpracticable. Whether or not it would be good or practical to build a road from the school to Opitsat Reserve or not, to get landing facilities, I do not know. This is an old building, and personally, I do not like the fire hazard. I believe a fire alarm system was supplied some time ago, but it has not yet been installed. The fire escapes or ladders are badly placed, being in angles, at the back of the building on the lee side from the prevailing winds. This would cause drafts and much smoke. One of the so-called escapes, placed on a flat wall at the back, is one of the most stupid arrangements I have ever seen called an escape. It is a flat, wooden ladder, nailed against the wall at a most difficult angle from the escape window, with no ladder. It does not reach the ground by about fifteen feet and is broken in the middle. It is impossible, in my opinion, for women, or young children, and most men, particularly with smoke around, not to slip or fall.\n\nThe rooms and building were clean and well kept, but the floors are going rapidly. New bakery ovens are required and a proper place for the manual training, at present, in a small shed. Some clearing was being done for a play ground, departmental expense, I understand. I suggested to the Rev. Father in charge temporarily, that the Department would like Indians from the neighbouring village employed on the work to help them over the bad times.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell.\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nVictoria, B.C., August 17, 1932.\n\nSIR:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith the report of Mr. Inspector Pragnell dated July 30th on his inspection of the West Coast agency.\n\nCHRISTIE SCHOOL:\n\nThe Reverend Principal is in touch with the Dominion Department of Public Works in regard to a proposed wharf. The question of making a road as mentioned by Inspector Pragnell may be considered in the above connection.\n\nIt is deemed of importance to suggest that either the Principal or the Indian Agent should be instructed to give attention to the faulty condition of fire escapes and the installation of the system mentioned by the Inspector as having been supplied according to his belief.\n\nThe question as to the supply of the new bakery ovens, whether by the department or from school grant, will no doubt be considered by the Department; likewise the need for a proper place for carrying on Manual Training work.\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, September 19, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from the Assistant Indian Commissioner, Victoria, B.C., enclosing the report of Mr. Inspector Pragnell on his inspection last summer of the Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Inspector has drawn attention to the fire escapes, which, he states, are built of wood and are badly placed, being in angles, at the back of the building, on the leeside from the prevailing winds, which would cause drafts and much smoke in case of fire. He also states that one of the escapes is placed on a flat wall at the back of the building. It is a flat, wooden ladder, nailed against the wall at a most difficult angle from the escape window, with no landing. It does not reach the ground by about fifteen feet, and is broken in the middle.\n\nI have to request that you will, at an early date, forward a report regarding the fire escape facilities at this school. You should consult the Reverend Principal in connection with the matter, and state the opinion arrived at as to the providing of proper fire escape facilities. An estimate of the cost should be furnished of installing any new escapes or in altering the present ones. The Department is desirous of reducing the fire hazard at this school to the lowest possible point, and, as this is an important matter, the Principal and yourself should give it every consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

This should have been done and had your requisition been sent to the Indian Agent, he no doubt would have considered including this item.\n\nWhen I hear from the Department, I will advise you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Chas.

Perry,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis institution has always been compelled to consider the matter of cutting bread one of its distressing problems, and that because an old, home-made apparatus is the means of slicing an average of one hundred and twenty-five loaves of bread a day. The most objectionable feature about this apparatus is the menace it constitutes to the operator. Not a few of the girls who operate the bread-cutter have had close calls to losing a finger or a thumb, not to mention less serious accidents, and the unusually large number of such casualities recently has impressed upon me the need of a replacement.\n\nNow making such is quite beyond me because of the large and many expenditures on repairs I am being compelled to make, and I am, therefore, writing you on the subject in the hope that you will be able to interest the Department in coming to our assistance.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n\"Victor Rassier\"\nOttawa, November 9, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/15/26807 of the 31st ultimo, enclosing copy of a letter received from the Reverend Principal of the Christie Indian Residential School, requesting a bread slicer.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, owing to lack of funds, the Department is unable to authorize the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nNEEDED AT CHRISTIE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nKakawis, B.C.\n\n(1) A Wharf: On my visit to Ottawa in July of this year, I was assured by Mr. Ferrier, the late Superintendent of Education, that a wharf would be built at Kakawis next Spring. As an initial step to this end, the services of Mr. Mitchell of Victoria of the Department of Public Works were obtained to make a survey. For some reason the Department has now seen fit to drop the project.\n\n(2) A Refund of $5,000.00 because of the following expenditures I was compelled to make on most necessary improvements and repairs:\n\n(1) Land cleared and drained at a cost of over $4,000.00;\n(2) The construction of a Bakery: materials and cost of excavations and necessary cement work amounting to approximately $500.00. The Department allowed $300.00 toward this work;\n(3) Purchase of a bake-oven, dough-mixer and engine at a cost of approximately $1,500.00. The Department made an allowance of $500.00 towards the cost of a dough-mixer;\n(4) Necessary repairs and replacements in buildings and grounds, some of which were: slip, track, walks about the buildings, roof, doors, windows, floors, and special repairs in kitchen, laundry and boys' bath.\n\n(3) Materials and furnishings for a two story building about 40 x 50 feet to serve as school room and dormitory for the junior boys. Our present dormitory space is proving inadequate to accommodate the increasing number of boys; the single room that must serve all the boys as class room, study and assembly hall, makes teaching and the proper supervision of the boys most onerous and almost impossible tasks.\n\n(4) Replacement of floors in kitchen, girls' dining room, boys' dormitory and several corridors where floors are actually worn through.\n\n(5) Paint for both interior and exterior of building.\n\n(6) 16 desks for the girls', and 60 desks for the boys' class rooms. In the girls' class room are to be found old home-made articles serving as desks, while in the boys' school room the desks are the antiquated double type which have seen so much service that continual repairs to them are necessary.\n\n(7) Replacement of two sewing machines (old ones).\n\n(8) A Nurse: to look after Indians on the reservations.\n\nOctober 5, 1932.\n\nVictor Rassier, Principal\nKIRKLAND & ROSE\nBAKERS & CONFECTIONERS SUPPLIES\nTOOLS, UTENSILS, MACHINERY & EQUIPMENT\nSODA FOUNTAINS & FOUNTAIN SUNDRIES\n\n130 WATER STREET\nVANCOUVER, CANADA\n\nNovember 19, 1932\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, CANADA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn accordance with instructions received from Rev.

However, this matter will receive consideration when our Estimates are being prepared for the next fiscal year.\n\nI may add that a communication has been received from Messrs.

C.\n(WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND)\n\nDec. 5, 1932.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhile the Department's letter of the 25th ultimo, File No. 159-0-5, refusing my application for a refund, has placed me in a very uncomfortable position because of certain obligations I took upon myself on the strength of Mr. Ferrier's assurance that this assistance would be forthcoming, I realize I have no alternative but to reconcile myself to the inevitable and make the best of a very trying situation.\n\nFurthermore, your reference to estimates being prepared for the next fiscal year has further served to disturb me in that on another promise of Mr. Ferrier I have purchased dormitory supplies to the amount of $800.00, he having advised me that such a sum would be refunded to me at the beginning of the next fiscal year.\n\nThat you may understand my plight permit me to explain that in the last four months I have been compelled to make extensive repairs to the buildings, replacements in sidewalks and the like about the place, and improvements which I felt could no longer be delayed. Two of these I think deserving of special mention here:\n\n(1) Our baking problem had assumed most serious proportions in that our bake oven had burned out and that the doctor had found mixing the dough quite strenuous for the girls who, by circumstances, were compelled to perform that task. The purchase of a new oven, dough mixer and engine, the construction of an addition to house these have cost me over $2000.00.\n\n(2) Another item of heavy expense, of approximately $5,000.00, was the clearing, draining and leveling of a piece of land to supply the children with some kind of recreation grounds, as they have almost nothing in that line.\n\nAllow me to stress the fact that in both undertakings all work that could possibly be entrusted to the Indians was performed by them at days wages. We distributed the work as judiciously as we could, engaging Indians from Hesquiat, Ahousaht, Keltsamart and Clayoquot reservations. I was in hopes that eventually I would receive at least a partial refund for these expenditures, the improvements being major ones and the necessity for them very great.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n(Rev.)

I was wondering if that particular fire-escape would be necessary in view of the fact that there is an entrance to, or exit from, both sides of the dormitory, the one leading directly through the school room to the outside.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) Victor Bassler\n\nReceived Dec. 26th 1932\nI have the honour to refer to the Department's letter of Sept. 19th, 1933, calling for a report on notes made by Inspector Pragnell on his inspection of Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nI beg to advise the Department that an addition has been built to the kitchen in the angle where the fire escape complained of was situated. The fire escape now passes over the new structure and the funnel effect mentioned by Inspector Pragnell is eliminated. This escape is satisfactory to the School Principal.\n\nThe break mentioned by Inspector Pragnell in the ladder escape on the flat face of the building was not a break, portions had been cut out of the ladder when some plumbing repairs were in progress and the section was not replaced. As in the Rev. Principal's opinion, this escape is unnecessary, as there are two other exits, one from each side of the dormitory affected. (Principal's note attached.) I suggested that an iron ladder escape be installed in place of the wooden ladder, but in the Principal's opinion this is not necessary.\n\nThe empty fire buckets noted by Inspector Pragnell were emptied for repainting.\n\nThe fire alarm system, with alarm stations in each of the dormitories, halls, class rooms and kitchen has been installed and was tested during my visit on the 26th instant and is satisfactory to the Principal.\n\nThe fire escapes were originally installed at my request and the locations were selected by the Rev. Principal in charge of the school at that time, those locations being in his opinion the most satisfactory.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nEd C. Host\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 2, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, regarding the fire escape at the Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that the Principal and yourself consider that the fire escapes are now in satisfactory condition, and that there are exits from each side of the dormitory.

I HAVE NOW TO REPORT THAT EVEN THIS POOR ESCAPE HAS BEEN DONE AWAY WITH through some building operations at the back of the school. I certainly do consider that some proper fire escapes should be constructed at the ends of the school building. In case of fire here I do not see how the children could be saved without some form of escapes. Wooden ones would probably serve the purpose just as well as expensive iron escapes. The seven large fire extinguishers do not appear to have been tested lately. I believe that these should be recharged as soon as possible.\n\nThere are six hydrants with hose pipe located inside the school building, and there are three more outside. The water comes from the mountain through a tank on the side of the hill. The pressure in the pipes is about 62 pounds. I am not satisfied with the protection afforded to the children at this school from fire, and would ask the Department to consider the matter. The erection of suitable escapes and the recharging of the fire fighting extinguishers of the soda-acid type would greatly lessen the risk.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR G. H.

When completed they will represent an expenditure of approximately $4,000.00. The monastery to which I belong, after the Superior had investigated and found conditions deplorable as I had described them, was good enough to make me a loan of $3,000.00 to enable me to proceed.\n\nThese facts and the following resume of what has been done and is being done are brought to your attention in the hope that if it is ascertained these repairs were as necessary as I have represented them to be, the Department may consider it but fair to assist me to some extent in removing the financial responsibility I have assumed. I am sure it will be found upon investigation that I only did that which the Department would have found itself eventually compelled to do. Christie School should not be closed. Permit me to assure you that in every instance every effort was made to be as economical as possible both in deciding what was necessary and in purchasing materials.\n\n(1) Slip: All freight, etc., intended for Christie School must be hauled up the slip. This is in bad shape, the Ford engine which up to now turned the winch, will no longer serve, a shed at the bottom of the slip to protect the freight from rain which often over-takes us while unloading, and another shed to house the winch and engine are necessary. A second hand Novo hoist at $350.00 and most of the material for repairs to the slip and construction of the sheds have been purchased.\n\n(2) Freight Dory: the old one had been in service so long and repaired so often that further overhauling was a waste of money and effort; and besides the condition of the dory constituted a menace to life. A new one was constructed at a cost of $170.00.\n\n(3) Boys' Toilets: because a nuisance to health as well as to order replacing them could no longer be postponed. A second-hand range of six toilets has been purchased which we hope soon to place in a new structure a short distance from the main building. Materials for the structure have still to be purchased.\n\n(4) Electric Wiring: the fire hazard from the faulty wiring of the building was appalling and the drain on electric current due to the same reason shortened the life of batteries considerably. After a careful study of the problem it was decided that nothing would be better than remove the old wiring and replace properly. The work was done by one of my maintenance men, a skilled electrician, with the aid of the senior boys.\n\n(5) School Desks: We were not only short in number, but the old desks and make-shifts made to serve as desks were collapsing from age and use. The necessary number were purchased and set up.\n(6) Painting: painting the interior and exterior of the building was necessary not so much to improve the appearance of the institution but to save from further deterioration what is left of it. Only a small portion of the structure had been originally painted some 30 years ago. The boys under the supervision of one of the maintenance men have done most the building, besides mixing practically all of the paint used after I had purchased the ingredients.\n\n(7) Floors: The floors in parts of the building, e.g., the kitchen, dining rooms, sewing room, girls' living room and the corridors, were badly worn; in some places entirely worn away. These floors have been replaced in part.\n\n(8) Drains and Water Main: parts of the drainage system about the building had to be replaced due to the fact that water was seeping through the walls of the building and flooding especially those parts of the basement where are located the boys' wash and locker room, boiler room and storage room. Sections of the main water line, due to faulty laying, had deteriorated and were leaking badly, threatening our water supply. New sections have been purchased and the old replaced.\n\n(9) Drier: the drier in the laundry was heated with hot water in consequence of which it was impossible to get the clothes dry. Following wash days practically every radiator in the house had its burden of clothes to dry, and ironing was a long drawn-out process. A 2,99 H.P. steam boiler and necessary piping was purchased and substituted for the old hot water boiler at a cost of approximately $300.00.\n\n(10) Batteries: The old lighting batteries were completely exhausted. A new set has been purchased at a cost of approximately $600.00. The rambling, spread-out construction of the building, necessitating the use of an extremely large number of lights, made it necessary to install batteries capable of sustaining a very heavy load.\n\nPermit me to call your attention, also, to the expenditure of more than $5,000.00 during the school year 1932-1933 to provide the children with a play-ground. This was also made possible through the kind assistance of our monastery. The work constituted clearing land, removing stumps from, draining and filling in, a swamp, and installing an elaborate drainage system. The particular point to which I would call your attention is the fact that, excepting supervision by three white men, all the work was done by Indians, every reservation being represented but the most northern, the \"Yugust.\" To these Indians went the large bulk of the $5,000.00 expended in the form of wages at $1.85 a day; and there can be no doubt that the Department was relieved of no small item of expense in the way of relief by the wages earned in this undertaking.\n\nTwo matters I would beg you to consider with approval are the following:\n\n(1) A resident nurse: Christie School and the Catholic tribes of the West Coast Agency stand very much in need of a trained nurse. The need is created by con-\ntions that present a problem which seems to admit of no other solution. The tribes live on reservations scattered along the coast. The nearest hospital is at Port Alberni, a twelve hours journey from the nearest reserve by the C. & R. steamer which plies the coast three times a month. It is quite out of the question to expect the doctor residing at Tofino to give the Indians and the school the attention and care that is necessary, whereas a nurse, appointed for the task of visiting the reserves regularly and with headquarters at the school, would be in a position to accomplish much.\n\nThe present arrangement whereby a field matron is stationed at the Protestant mission at Ahousaht to look after the needs in that respect of the school and the neighboring reserve, while the Catholic School and nine Catholic tribes are compelled to do without such an asset, is most unfair. While the understanding seems to have been that the matron was appointed with the entire northern section of the agency as her field of activity, the fact of the matter is, she has always confined her ministrations to the one school and the one reserve. It should be added furthermore that the present matron has made herself quite undesirable for work amongst the Catholic tribes because of her proselytizing propensities; an objection that very likely should always continue in the event a single matron were appointed to serve the two residential schools and the reservations.\n\n(2) Materials for a structure: a two story structure of approximately these dimensions: 30 x 40 feet. At present we have but the one room, 20 x 32 feet, which must serve as study, class and assembly room for all the boys. The structure requested would provide us with two class rooms and a little additional dormitory space, besides enabling us to use the present class-room for a dining room. The present dining room is too small for the number of boys in attendance.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nVictor Besser\n(Rev.) Victor Besser, O.S.B.\nPrincipal\n\nHarold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 7, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the requisition which you forwarded, to be supplied with 20 gallons of bulk Pyrene for refills for the fire extinguishers at the Alberni Indian Residential School. In this connection it is considered that you can arrange for the purchase of the quantity of chemicals required for refills for the extinguishers at this school. No doubt, you can procure same in Victoria from the local agent of the Pyrene Manufacturing Company or from a firm on the list to receive consideration. Only the quantity required to refill the extinguishers at the present time should be obtained.\n\nPlease obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. An encumbrance certificate covering the expense will be obtained here when the account is received.\n\nAfter the refills have been received at the school, the Principal should have them installed and the extinguishers placed in a good, serviceable condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

There are no funds provided in our Estimates this year for any repairs or equipment at your school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Victor Rassier, O.S.B.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Indian Res. School,\nKakawis, B.C.\nJuly 15, 1933.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 4th instant, file number 159-0-5, informing me that no reimbursement could be made of the expenses incurred clearing and draining a piece of land, was quite discouraging. I was in hopes that at least some amount would be forthcoming, with which I would be enabled to make some very necessary repairs. Many of the floors of the building are actually worn through; we are short of desks, while many of the old ones are crumbling to pieces from age and use; places in the roof need mending; the machinery for drawing our freight up the slip is in bad shape; while the toilets in the boys' department have become a nuisance and a menace to health. Because of this state of affairs, I feel I must call the attention of the Department to an arrangement made with Mr. Ferrier, some record of which must surely be on file, in accordance with which I was to purchase bed supplies to the value of $880.00, a refund to be made to me after the beginning of the fiscal year 1933. This money would enable me to make most of the repairs suggested. I am, therefore, respectfully requesting the Department to look into the matter.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nVictor Massier\nPrincipal\nOttawa, July 4, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 25th ultimo, I regret to inform you that, as our Appropriation for Indian Education was so greatly reduced, it was not possible to include an item towards reimbursement of the expenses incurred in the clearing, draining and levelling of a plot of land at the Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

May I respectfully inquire whether an amount for this purpose was allowed?\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nVictor Rassier\nPrincipal\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to advise the Department that the following improvements have been asked for by the Rev. Principal of the Christie Indian Residential School:\n\n\"Improvement No. 1. Boy's toilet twelve by twenty two by eleven concrete floor, walls rustic siding wallpaper shiplap and V joint shingle roof, one three foot four by seven doors, two windows one half by six, one window three by six. Six windows two by three. Sixteen by sixteen inch sink two by two janitor lockers, six automatic flush range closets, ten foot urinal, forty foot waste pipe two hundred foot galvanized one inch water pipe, unions, elbows. Estimated cost seven hundred dollars.\n\nImprovement No. 2. Freight shed at bottom of slip, eighteen feet long four by ten shingle roof rustic siding two by twelve floor, estimated cost one hundred dollars.\n\nImprovement No. 3. Shed for hoist and engine hoist thirty six hundred and forty dollars shed ten by twenty eight, rustic siding and shiplap two doors four windows shingle roof, estimated cost four hundred thirty dollars.\n\nImprovement No. 4. Three thousand board feet fir edge grain flooring grade one and two, estimated cost, one hundred thirty dollars.\n\nImprovement No. 5. Two class rooms and dormitory space. Estimates being forwarded by Lemon Gonnason, Victoria.\"\n\nAgent's remarks on above:\n\nImprovement No. 1. Boy's toilet, estimated cost \u00a3700.00. This is needed and work has been commenced on it. The old toilet is situated very near the door of the boy's dining room, is obsolete and unsanitary. Mr. MacInnes noted the smell from the place and commented on it when he visited Christie School on August 7th, 1934.\n\nImprovement No. 2. Freight shed at bottom of freight slip. Estimated cost \u00a3100.00. Size asked for 24'x18'x10'-storage space 160 cubic yards. In my opinion a freight shed capable of storing goods brought up by steamer in bad weather would greatly assist in the prevention of damage to spoilable goods. But I fail to see the necessity of a storage or freight shed of the size mentioned above, as that space (as in instance or illustration) would accommodate 60 wagon loads of 2 cubic yards each and I cannot imagine anything near that quantity of perishable goods being delivered at that school at any one time. One ton of sacked flour will occupy a storage space, 10'x2'x2', approximately 30 cubic feet.\n\nImprovement No. 3.\nImprovement No. 3.\u2014 Shed for hoist and engine hoist 10'x20'x8'. Estimated cost $340.00. There is a car engine employed at Christie School; this machine is geared to haul a small freight car over hills by wire cable from the beach to the school level. I fail to see the necessity for a shed of the size asked for or for the use of expensive lumber in the construction of a hoist shelter and shed 10'x20'x8'. Estimated cost $430.00. These are combined in the Rev. Principal's application, but I fail to see what the second shed is intended to be used for.\n\nImprovement No. 4.\u2014 3000 b.f. edge grain flooring grades 1 and 2. The floors in several of the halls and rooms are in a very worn condition and badly in need of reflooring. Estimated cost $150.00. Some of this work was being done during the summer holidays. Worthy of consideration.\n\nImprovement No. 5.\u2014 New class rooms and dormitory. No details, the estimated cost of all material, as given by Lemon Johnson Co., Ltd., is $2100.00. F. C. H. host at Kakawis. I respectfully beg to suggest that the opinion of Mr. Inspector A. H. Scott be obtained in this matter as he should be better aware of the needs of the school, as called for by school regulations, than the Indian Agent. In my opinion improvement is needed in the boys class rooms and dormitory. The present pupilage of Christie School is 100, and the school is very seldom up to full strength, the population of the district from which its pupils are obtained is not increasing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEd.

However, the\nPrincipal's request has been noted and further consideration\nwill be given to it when we are preparing our estimates for\nthe fiscal year 1936-37.\n\nWhen Mr. Phelan visited the Christie School, he\nauthorized the following expenditures:\n\nLumber for floors, approximately, $200.00\nPipe for hot water tank ....... 15.00\nPaint ......................... 50.00\nRepairs to bake oven ......... 100.41\n\nMoney is available in this year's appropriation for\nthese expenditures and purchases should be made from firms on\nthe approved list and vouchers, in triplicate, submitted for\npayment.\n\nThe above expenditures do not amount to as much as\nis provided in this year's appropriation for the Christie School\nbut you should inform the Principal that, later in the year, he\nshould bring to our consideration some other accounts for the\nbalance of the amount provided in this year's appropriation, viz.,\n$700.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH.

MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, copy of a letter, received in this office from the Reverend Principal of the Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nThe letter being self explanatory. However a very great need will be overcome if the proposed wing can be constructed. The school, as you will remember, is crowded, especially in the winter months, as there are many days when pupils cannot be allowed outside, owing to the very heavy rainfall.\n\nThe estimate, is very fair, but a small saving could be made if two by four were used for the frame of the second story instead of six by six. A further saving could be effected if V joint were used inside instead of Gyprock. However the latter is a very good fire protection and in an isolated place like Kakawis such precautions are very necessary. The total saving in changing these two items would be approximately $200.00.\n\nIf further data is required same can be supplied on notice to this office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. P.

Phelan, Esq.,\nEducational Branch,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawis, B.C.\n(WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND)\n\nJuly 25, 1935.\n\nMr. Phelan,\nInspector of Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith regard to the new addition to be erected at the above institution I am submitting for your consideration and the Department's the estimates which I have received. Again I would lay stress on the crowded quarters of the dormitory and the advisability of separating the small boys from the larger ones. During the rainy season which is rather long here on this coast the boys have no recreation hall which makes it rather difficult both for the prefects and the children. I am sure that such an asset will go far in promoting a better spirit among those under our charge.\n\nThe cost of the building complete without the wiring amounts to $4,186.50. The wiring is estimated at $200.00 with the same amount necessary for the towing of the necessary materials to the school. The total cost will be $4,386.50.\n\nThe building will consist of three rooms, a dormitory, a class room and a recreation hall for the boys. At present the class room for the boys is small and as such is only improvised to meet the present necessity.\n\nHoping the Department will look on this proposition with favour and grant us an early reply, I remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nFather Bertrand O.S.B.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 24, 1935.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, requesting that this Department assume responsibility for the payment of insurance on the buildings at the Christie Indian Residential School or that it take over the school property.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department is not in a position at the present time to purchase the property at this school. The Government does not place insurance on any buildings, except in cases where the Indians themselves have provided, from their own funds, for the cost of same. I, therefore, regret that the Department is unable to pay any part of the cost of insurance on the Christie Indian Residential School or to purchase the property.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. Bertrand McLaughlin, CSB.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Indian Res. School,\nKakawis, B.C.\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawin, B.C.\n(WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND)\n\n7-15-35.\n\nMr. H. W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring the past few days the Superior of our Order has been here on his visitation and has instructed me to see that insurance be placed on the school. There are a number of ways in which this can be done. Since our income at the school is limited to the per capita grant and the carpenter's allowance we could hardly make the necessary payments on an insurance policy. We would suggest that the Department take over the school and place insurance on it thereby relieving us of the burden or at least grant us so much in order to make those payments. If the school should burn down we do not feel that the obligation of restoration would revolve on us since the government has the obligation of educating the Indians with all conditions of credit taken into consideration. If the Department does not wish to purchase the school and take over the whole responsibility for the insurance then we would suggest that we be assisted in paying the policy.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon on this important matter and with best regards to Mr. Phelan, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFather Bertrand McLaughlin,\nPrincipal.\nPort Alberni, B.C., June 23rd\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn company with Acting Agent Nightingale I visited the Christie Indian Residential School today.\n\nYou are aware of the amount provided in this year's appropriation for this school, and I have therefore authorized the agent to expend the following amounts:\n\n- Lumber for floors: $400.00\n- Pipe for hot water tank: $15.00\n- Paint: $50.00\n- Repairs to bakeoven: $100.00\n\nWhen these accounts are received I will forward payment.\n\nThese do not amount to as much as the amount provided but later in the year the Principal will forward for our consideration some other accounts for the balance appropriated.\n\nIt will not be necessary to do anything about the toilets as the school management has already provided ones that are fairly suitable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 3)\nOttawa, May 14th, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to a request made last year by your predecessor, Rev. Victor Rassier, O.S.B., for a refund of $4,000 covering the cost of improvements made by him to the Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nIn connection with the repairs made by Father Rassier, I would refer you to official letter of September 12th, 1934, and, also, to circular letter of April 19th, 1934. The expenditure incurred by Father Rassier was made without first receiving the Department's authority. As the building is owned by your Order, our permission to make repairs was not absolutely necessary but, at the same time, it should have been secured if the Department was expected to make reimbursement.\n\nWhen preparing our estimates for the current fiscal year, some consideration was given to Father Rassier's request for a refund of, approximately, $4,000, but it was found impossible to include the amount in our appropriation.\n\nAn officer of the Schools Branch expects to visit the Christie School about the last week of June and he will discuss the matter further with you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Bertrand McLaughlin, O.S.B.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Indian Res.

McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMy predecessor, Father Victor Rassier, on turning over the work of this institution to me advised that I approach you on the matter of a refund amounting approximately to four thousand dollars ($4,000.00), three thousand of which was borrowed from our monastery. Of late our monastery has been somewhat cramped financially and they have placed upon my shoulders the burden of reclaiming what they have loaned for the better upkeep of this school. We feel that this school's gain has been the monastery's loss.\n\nFather Victor has given you a resume of what has been done in the line of improvements and I have invoices on file to substantiate his statements. I would therefore ask that you do us the favour to see that our work is at least appreciated to the extent that we are not compelled to go in debt to assure the Indians a little comfort during their days at this institution. You may be sure that I shall do all in my power to cooperate with the department and work for the betterment of the Indians, following the wonderful example given me by Father Victor.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 3)\nOttawa, October 26, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, regarding the improvements that have been requested by the Principal of the Christie Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to say that our Estimates for the next fiscal year will soon be in course of preparation, and, at that time, consideration will be given to providing the amount required to carry out certain of the improvements requested.\n\nIn June, last, a communication was received from the Principal, in which he stated that repairs and improvements were under way at this school, representing an expenditure of approximately $4,000. He mentioned at that time that it was intended to proceed with the work of erecting the boys' toilets and also a freight shed at bottom of slip, painting the interior and exterior of the building and effecting certain other repairs. He requested at that time to be reimbursed for his outlay. He was informed that no funds were available in our Appropriation for the present fiscal year but that consideration would be given when our Estimates were being prepared for the coming fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

In the event of our approving the installation of an oil heating system, it will be necessary to use for that purpose the funds provided in this year's Appropriation for other work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs time goes on it is becoming more difficult to get cord wood sufficient to assure a warm building during the winter months. In former days the wood was nearby, now it is quite a distance and very rough country. To buy coal would be out of the question since the cost would be considerable and then again there is the question of handling it which is a problem in itself on this beach. The number of big boys who could make cord wood could not possibly keep up as we have seen by past experience.\n\nI have written for estimates re the installation of an oil burner which would include the burner, tank and cost of installation. We ourselves could not stand the expense alone but if the department is unwilling to finance the proposition there might be a chance of their assisting.\n\nWe are anxious to settle the question as soon as possible since we must have heat in the house by the latter part of September. If the Department is willing I shall have the Imperial Oil Co. send in estimates after they have seen the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBertrand McLaughlin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 17, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn our Appropriation for the current fiscal year provision has been made for the following at the Christie Indian Residential School:\n\nAddition to girls' dormitory - $700\nInterior painting - $200\n\nPlease consult the Principal and give separate estimates of the amount required for material and for labour. With regard to the material, you should state exactly what is required and where it can be secured. In connection with the labour, please state if Indians can be employed. If not, you should advise what tradesmen will be required.

Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, April 8, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the Christie Indian Residential School, Inspector Barry states that there are seven large fire extinguishers and some half dozen Pyrene extinguishers, which have not recently been recharged.\n\nIf the small Pyrene extinguishers have not been used or damaged in any way, there is no necessity for recharging them. Please examine these extinguishers when you next visit the school, and advise the Department whether or not refills are required. With reference to the large extinguishers, please let me know the exact size of these, and the refills for them will be ordered.\n\nThe Inspector states, also, that the fire gongs do not ring distinctly, and he considers that new dry cells are probably required. The cost of these will not be great. You may arrange for their purchase.\n\nMr. Barry considers that fire escapes should be constructed at the ends of the school building. You might let me have an estimate of the cost. I would point out, however, that, owing to a reduction in our appropriation this year, it is very doubtful if we can authorize the expenditure that would be necessary. A final decision will not be given until your report is received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nB. C.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. G. H. BARRY, INSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS, DATED MARCH 25, 1936, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE CHRISTIE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on No. 159-0-6.\n\nFIRE PROTECTION: In opening this section of my report, I would ask that a copy of the Department's instructions with regard to fire drills be sent to the Principal. He does not appear to have a copy of this most important letter.\n\nThere are seven large Fire Extinguishers and some half dozen Pyrene extinguishers. I could not see any evidence that the Soda type extinguishers had been recharged lately. This I think ought to be done. There are six hydrants with hose pipe located inside the main buildings, and there are three more outside the buildings. There is a quantity of hose pipe for use with the hydrants. The water comes from the mountains through a tank on the side of the hill near the school. The pressure in the fire mains is between 60 and 70 pounds, and will throw water to the roof, I am informed.\n\nI held the usual fire drill while at the school. The Indian Agent and teacher who were with me in the senior girls' classroom did not hear the fire gongs. I was just able to do so, but only because I was waiting for them to ring. There are five gongs and I can only think that they did not all ring through lack of battery power. New dry cells are probably required. The fire drill was well carried out DOWN THE STAIRS INSIDE THE SCHOOL. The only escapes are as described in my last report, a wooden stairs at the back of the school leading to the roof of a low part of the school, and a wooden ladder fixed to the back wall of the school.\n\nI certainly consider that suitable fire escapes should be constructed at the ends of the school building. These need not be of iron. In case of a serious fire at this school I do not see how the children could all be saved. I asked that this matter should receive consideration by the Department, when I previously reported on this school after an inspection in April, 1934. I am simply not satisfied with the protection afforded to the children at this school in the case of fire, and wish to go on record to this effect. I have no doubt that the Indian Agent will be in full agreement with my view of the matter, and I can only think that the officials of the Schools Branch of the Department of Indian Affairs must have overlooked my previous remarks on the fire escape situation at this school.\nOttawa, April 1, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn official letter of the 18th ultimo you submitted voucher No. 959 covering the cost of linoleum purchased for the Christie Indian Residential School. The voucher was issued in favour of the Principal, but, as the account was not receipted, payment could not be made to him. As we wish to make this payment out of the appropriation for the fiscal year 1934-35, cheque has been sent to Gault Bros. Limited, Vancouver. In the event of the Principal already having paid them, he should arrange to obtain a refund from them.\n\nWhile the amount of the account was $294.00, there is a notation reading \"3% 10 days\". Present regulations require us to take off any discount noted on the company's letter head. Consequently, a discount of $8.52 has been deducted, and a cheque for $285.18 has been sent to Gault Bros. Limited.\n\nPlease inform the Principal of the Christie Residential School at once, in order that he may make any adjustment that may be necessary with Gault Bros.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. B.

No. 843, covering cost of linoleum purchased for Christie Residential School.\n\nAs the approximate measurement as contained in your letter of January 16, 1936, differed considerably from amount used I asked the Reverend Principal to verify same and attach here-with his reply in explanation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawis, B.C.\n(WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLANDS)\n\nMarch 14, 1936.\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease forward the enclosed invoices re linoleum used for the kitchen at the above institution. You may send this letter of explanation along with the invoices. Mr. Phelan did not measure the kitchen on his visit here but took a guess at the actual dimensions. We used approximately seventy square yards on the kitchen and small bread room which is part of the kitchen. For the kitchen alone one roll was not sufficient and as this kind of linoleum is sold only in rolls we found it necessary to order another roll hence the expense. However, I wrote to Mr. Phelan at Ottawa concerning this matter and told him that if the price was too high for the Department he should advise them that I would go the extra expense. Furthermore, I was told if there would be any linoleum left after the kitchen was supplied I should use it elsewhere in the house.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I have paid the bill since you returned the invoices to me. If the Department wishes to reimburse me they may do so instead of sending a cheque to Gault Brothers of Vancouver.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBertrand McLaughlin,\nPrin.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is the first time I have inspected this agency since Mr. Ashbridge took over.\n\nSCHOOLS:\n\nI did not visit any of the Residential schools in this agency as I had not the time available. However, Mr. Ashbridge informs me that the fire escapes at the Christie School have only just been fixed. I was under the impression that this had been done a long while ago. I know I took the matter up with the Department and pointed out this urgency.\n\nBoth the Indian Agent and myself do not think it is advisable to lay out much money on reconstruction of this said Christie School. It is a very old building and really should be rebuilt if it is considered advisable to continue with the residential school here.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, November 6, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, submitting a request from the Principal of the Christie Indian Residential School, that funds to the amount of $333.00 be provided to purchase the materials required in the erection of a building, combining machine shop, carpenter shop and woodshed.\n\nIn reply I have to say there have been so many demands for repairs, equipment, etc., at the Indian schools, that our appropriation for the current fiscal year is practically assigned. It will not be possible, therefore, to authorize the expenditure required in the purchase of the material for the erection of the building during the present fiscal year.\n\nI have also your letter of the 28th ultimo, requesting that a small stove be supplied, for use in the carpenter shop, at an estimated cost of $12.00. The Department will approve the purchase of the stove. You should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nB. C.\nOttawa, November 6, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, reporting on the fire escapes and fire fighting equipment at the Christie Indian Residential School. It is noted that this school is fully equipped with fire escapes and that the present means of escape is by stairways, placed at either end of the building, located where least exposed to danger from fire. It is noted, further, that a new escape is at present under construction, leading from both dormitories at the girls' end of the school. Regarding your recommendation, that another fire escape, of the same type, be placed at the boys' end of the building, the Department will approve of an expenditure, not exceeding $100.00, in providing the material required to erect this fire escape. It is to be understood that the work of installing the fire escape will be provided by the school staff. You may, therefore, purchase the material required, from a firm on the approved list, and arrange with the school authorities to construct the fire escape. You should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the materials, attach the accounts to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nIt is noted that the fire gang, located on the upper landing, and which has recently been put\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nB. C.\nin good order, is not adequate to be distinctly heard in all parts of the building. If the Principal and yourself recommend that a gong of larger capacity be installed, the Department will approve of the expenditure. You should discuss this matter with the Principal, and, if it is decided that a larger gong is necessary, you may arrange for the purchase and installation, keeping all costs as low as possible. You should then forward a properly certified voucher covering any expenditure incurred.\n\nIt is noted that fire drills are well conducted and that the water pressure and supply are good, also that the fire equipment is kept in good condition.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to submit a request of the Reverend Principal of Christie Indian Residential School for a small stove for use in the carpenter's shop.\n\nEstimated cost of same would be $12.00. I would respectfully recommend that this be granted, as the one in present use is old and dangerous.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to submit, for the consideration of the Department, a request of the Reverend Principal of Christie Residential School for a building combining machine shop, carpenter's shop and woodshed. The present woodshed, as referred to in my report on fire appliances, has always constituted a fire menace, and I strongly advise the school authorities to tear it down, or replace the shake roof with iron.\n\nPlans have been prepared for a two story building, 28 x 40 frame construction, which would combine carpenter and machine shop, and wood shed. Estimated cost would be as under:\n\n| Item       | Cost   |\n|------------|--------|\n| Lumber     | $550.00|\n| Shingles   | $68.00 |\n| Sash & Door| $75.00 |\n| Hardware   | $100.00|\n| Brick      | $20.00 |\n| Cement     | $20.00 |\n| Labor      | $80.00 |\n\nTotal $933.00\n\nWe labor, this would be furnished by the school except for one carpenter for 6 weeks. Referring to your letter, file 159-0-5 of June 17, 1936, provision was made for addition to girls dormitory $700.00, and interior painting $200.00, but as this work cannot be undertaken during the winter months on the main building estimates to cover these items were included for the next school year, and it is respectfully recommended that the amount, $900.00 available for the present year, be expended in the erection of this building, which is very much to be desired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge your letter of October 7th, 1936, re the fire escape facilities at each of the Ahousaht, Alberni, and Christie Indian Residential Schools, and to attach a report of my inspection of those schools, on the condition of fire escapes and other fire fighting equipment.\n\nI also respectfully submit with each report, a recommendation as to requirements as directed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nReport on condition of Fire Escapes and Fire Fighting Appliances at Christie Residential School.\n\nOctober 20, 1936.\n\nFire Escapes and Exits.\nThis school is poorly equipped with fire escapes. The present means of escape is by stairways placed at either end of the building. These however have the advantage of being so placed that the school can be emptied in less than two minutes, and are located in that part of the building least exposed to danger from fire. A new escape is at present under construction which leads from both dormitories, at the girls end of the school.\n\nPyrenes.\nPyrenes are placed at vantage points throughout the building, and are all in good order. Refills are also being supplied for these.\n\nFire Pails.\nFire pails are kept on landings, and at time of inspection were filled with water and in good order.\n\nFire Alarm.\nA large gong operated by electric switch is placed on upper landing. This has recently been put in good order. This gong is not considered adequate for the purpose, as it is indistinct at further end of building.\n\nHydrants.\nThere are six hydrants with hose located in the main building, and three hydrants outside.\n\nWater.\nWater pressure and supply is very good. Pressure about 70 lb. and sufficient to throw a stream over the roof.\n\nFire Drill.\nFire drills are well conducted. School can be emptied in two minutes by means of exits, under normal conditions. Staff and children know their stations.\n\nRecommendations.\nIt is recommended that a fire escape of the same type as the one being built (wood construction) be placed at the opposite end of building. In case of fire at boys end of building, escape would be cut off, should the stairway be involved. It is also recommended that a larger gong or bell be installed. Estimated cost of wooden fire escape and gong, labor to be provided by school staff, $100.00. It is further recommended that present roof of wood shed be torn down, as this is of cedar shake construction and very dangerous being directly opposite kitchen flues. This is being dealt with in separate letter.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nPBA/AM.\nOttawa, October 7, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOwing to certain fire hazard at the Ahousaht, Alberni and Christie Indian Residential Schools, it has been decided to make an allowance, at the rate of $40.00 per month, towards the salary of a night watchman at each school for the period from November first, next, to April 30, 1937.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Alberni,\nB. C.\nWest Coast Agency, Port Alberni, B.C.\nAugust 31, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit herewith the regular monthly letter covering conditions within this agency, for month ending August 31, 1936.\n\nSchools\n\nAll schools were inspected during the month and found in good order. Arrangements have been made to have regular visits by the Department medical officers paid in company with the agent when possible. All children are in good health and being well cared for. Food is good, properly cooked and sufficient. Fire drills were not carried out at Ahousaht or Christies school as new fire escapes are being built. New buildings and all repair work at all schools is regularly inspected by myself.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nThe sum of $900.00 is available in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year to carry out repairs, painting, etc., at the Christie Indian Residential School, Kakawis, B.C., west coast of Vancouver Island (Electoral District of Comox-Alberni).\n\nThe Principal and the local Indian Agent have made a survey of the present heating system in the building, which, they state, is absolutely necessary to be renewed. In view of the difficulty of obtaining wood and coal, they have recommended the installing of an oil heating system. The obtaining and handling of oil supplies is easily overcome, as the Imperial Oil Company, Limited, Vancouver, propose to keep a supply on hand at Tofino, where it can be obtained and shipped on the school launch. The great difficulty at this school is the handling of freight supplies, and the semi-annual supply of oil can be shipped direct on tanker and taken ashore on a scow, which is the property of the school.\n\nThe Imperial Oil Company, Limited,\n- Vancouver\nVancouver, furnished a quotation for the changing of the present heating system and boiler, supplying the necessary burners, tanks for oil storage, etc., for the price of $1,300.00, and guarantee satisfactory service for a period of one year from the date of installation.\n\nThe Principal is willing to apply the $900.00 available, mentioned above, towards the cost of the installation of an oil burning system and will pay the balance - $400.00 - from church funds.\n\nI would recommend, for your approval, that authority be granted to incur an expenditure of $900.00 for the purpose mentioned, and, as the Principal is paying part of the cost, that the contract to supply the oil burning equipment be given to the Imperial Oil, Limited, Vancouver, from whom the Principal will purchase the oil he requires, from school funds.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSeptember 1st, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nThe sum of $900.00 is available in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year to carry out repairs, painting, etc., at the Christie Indian Residential School, Kakawis, B.C., west coast of Vancouver Island (Electoral District of Comox-Alberni).\n\nThe Principal and the local Indian Agent have made a survey of the present heating system in the building, which, they state, is absolutely necessary to be renewed.

Ltd., propose to keep supply on hand at Tofino from where in emergency it can be obtained and shipped on school launch. A semi annual supply can be shipped direct on tanker and taken ashore on scow which is the property of the school.\n\nThe Reverend Principal is quite willing to apply the $900.00 available for current fiscal year and will find the balance of $400.00 from the Church funds as the addition to dormitory cannot be carried out while the school is open and he thinks they will be able to find means of doing this work themselves at a later date.\n\nIt will be noted that Imperial Oil Ltd., have been very thorough and will guarantee their work. In view of the necessity of properly heating the building and the very real difficulty existing in obtaining wood it is respectfully recommended that the oil heaters be installed and the funds available as mentioned in your letter No. 159-0-5 of June 17, 1936 be applied for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nPBA/A.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn complying with your request that our engineers make a survey of the above school, we take great pleasure in submitting to you for your approval our report as follows:\n\nBefore we could arrive at a decision as to the feasibility of satisfactorily heating the above school with oil burning equipment, we first made a complete plan of the school and its present radiation, which we give you as follows:\n\nBoiler. The boiler is of a type that will give good efficiency with oil fuel, having a gross radiation of 6050 square ft. output. The condition of the boiler to all appearances is good except the grates and the smoke pipe, which will necessarily have to be renewed.\n\nRadiation and Piping. The complete radiation at present in the school is 4389 square ft. gross. There is a shortage of radiation in some of the rooms, but we feel that with proper firing of the boiler and insulating some of the present exposures, this will be overcome. Some of the piping should be covered, otherwise the heating pipes, locations and capacities are very good.\n\nBurners. The burners we will install would be our Model BS capable of satisfactorily heating your boiler. We would also install an Automatic Burner Model JB in the heating boiler for domestic hot water.\n\nTanks. We will install 2500 gallons of oil storage and pipe same to burner.\n\nPrice. We will install all the above equipment, including the brickwork and bricks, the electric work and all the electrical equipment necessary to make this installation a success, the heating boiler to be controlled by a clock thermostat, for the following price of $1300.00.\n\nGuarantee. We guarantee the above equipment to be installed\nin a workmanlike manner, and in accordance with the Provincial Fire and Electrical Regulations for installations governing the same.\n\nAnd furthermore guarantee this equipment against defective material and workmanship for a period of one year from the date of installation.\n\nWe wish to thank you for the opportunity of submitting the above price and proposed equipment, and trust that it will meet with your favour and you will decide to install the equipment in the above school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nImperial Oil, Ltd.\n\nR.M. Pidgeon\n\nJJE/B.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of August 5, 1936, re fire extinguishers at Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nThese were referred to as 3 gallon in error and should have read 2\u00bd gallon. The name of extinguisher is Guardine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, August 5, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo, you may expend $42.00 in the purchase and delivery of lumber and fittings for new fire escapes at the Christie Indian Residential School. It is noted that the labour will be supplied by the school staff.\n\nWith regard to the refills requested for fire extinguishers, I would point out that the Department has never supplied 3-gallon extinguishers. Some schools have been sent 2\u00bd-gallon extinguishers, while others have been sent 5-gallon extinguishers. Please let me know the name of the manufacturer of the 3-gallon extinguisher which you mention in your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nB. C.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of April 8, 1936, re Fire appliances at Christie Indian School and to report as follows:\n\n1. Pyrene extinguishers all now in good order.\n\n2. 3-Gallon extinguishers. All in good order but will require refills for seven against emergency.\n\n3. Fire gong has been repaired and now in good working order.\n\n4. New Fire escapes as recommended by Mr. Barry, can be easily built of wood construction in the front of main building. Estimated cost, Lumber and fittings $34.00 Freight $8.00 Total $42.00. Labor to be supplied by the school. This escape is very necessary and is respectfully recommended as the present escapes are quite inadequate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B.

Any paint or other materials purchased should be secured from firms on the approved list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of May 6, 1937, with reference to appropriation for painting and repairs to Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nAs instructed, I consulted with the Reverend Principal on this matter, and he decided that he would like to use the total of $400.00 for painting the exterior.\n\nSince this conversation with him, I have received the attached letter, in which he asks for $900.00 for this purpose.\n\nI beg to advise the Department that, while the rear of the building needs painting, the front can go for another year, and the amount specified, $400.00, should be sufficient for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

G.S. Pragnell and Dr. P.B. Ashbridge, it was deemed advisable to paint the main building of Christie Residential School.\n\nIt has been a number of years since any great amount of painting has been done around the place with the result that the buildings begin to look quite neglected. We feel that the department is anxious to maintain a certain standard in all her institutions of learning and for that reason we are applying to you for sufficient material or paint to the amount of $900.00.\n\nI am the new principal at the school and I understand that the Indian Department has always been kindly disposed to Christie School and ready to assist in anything for the betterment and maintenance of the Indian institutions.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nRev.

School,\nKakawis, B.C.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nOn the occasion of my last inspection of Christie School on December 13th, I, acting upon instructions of the late Rev. Lee, examined the watchman as to his suitability, and regret to inform you that I found him everything but satisfactory.\n\nHe not only did not know how to use the fire appliances, but did not know where they were or what they consisted of. He did not know what the fire alarm was, and when shown, did not know how to use it until demonstrated by Father Lee. To the date of inspection he had not visited the hose hydrants or extinguishers. His answers as to his duties and patrol of the building were most alarming, and showed positively that he either had not been made aware of his duties, or that he was completely incapable of carrying them out.\n\nIn view of the great danger of fire at your school, it being a wooden building, and the almost certain loss of life should it unfortunately happen, I must request that you take immediate steps to remedy this condition, and report by return what steps have been taken.\n\nAs you were away at the time of inspection, I brought the matter to the attention of Father Lee, and asked him to see that this man was made thoroughly acquainted with the location, nature, and use of all equipment. To test hose and hydrants frequently, also extinguishers.\n\nTo make him familiar with alarm stations. To make regular patrol throughout the building, basement and outhouses, all through the night, and to report anything out of order to the Principal immediately.\n\nKindly say if this has been done and also if you are satisfied that this man is fit to assume the responsibility of the safety of your pupils and the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.B.

C. 13/253 dated February 3, 1938\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 6th April, 1938, from the Minister of Mines and Resources, stating:\n\nWhat the estimates for the fiscal year 1938-39, Vote Number 139, Indian Affairs Branch, Mines and Resources, provide an amount of $34,582.00 for new works, repairs and purchase of equipment for the following Church owned Indian Residential Schools;\n\n(a) ONTARIO.\nSpanish Roman Catholic Residential School\nMoose Fort Church of England Residential School.\n\n(b) SASKATCHEWAN.\nThunderchild Roman Catholic Residential School\n\n(c) ALBERTA.\nErmineskin Roman Catholic Residential School\nGrouard Roman Catholic Residential School\nHoly Angel Roman Catholic Residential School\nJesuit Roman Catholic Residential School\nSt Albert Roman Catholic Residential School.\nSturgeon Lake Roman Catholic Residential School\nVermilion Roman Catholic Residential School\nWabasca Roman Catholic Residential School\nWabasca Church of England Residential School\nWhitefish Lake Church of England Residential School\n\n(d) NORTHWEST TERRITORIES.\nAklavik Roman Catholic Residential School\nAklavik Church of England Residential School\nFort Resolution Roman Catholic Residential School\nProvidence Mission Roman Catholic Residential School\n\n(e) BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nAhousaht United Church Residential School\nCariboo Roman Catholic Residential School\nChristie Roman Catholic Residential School\nKitamaat United Church Residential School\nPort Simpson United Church Residential School\nSt Mary's Mission Roman Catholic Residential School\nSquamish Roman Catholic Residential School.\nThat, as these buildings are Church owned, new works, repairs and purchase of equipment constitute a grant, and, therefore, the approval of Your Excellency in Council is desirable.\n\nThe Minister, therefore, recommends that approval be given for the expenditure at the above-mentioned Indian Residential Schools of the sum of $34,582.00, same to be chargeable to Vote Number 169, 1938-39, Indian Affairs Branch, Mines and Resources.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n\nE. J. Lemaire.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\n\nthe Minister of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa,\nApril 9, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the Christie Residential School on the 21st ultimo Inspector Barry did not appear to be satisfied with the operation of the oil burning heating system.\n\nWhile this system was installed by the school authorities, and they are responsible for its maintenance and repair, at the same time the Department wishes to feel certain that the pupils are not subject to any danger through its use.\n\nI would appreciate your discussing the heating system with the Principal on the occasion of your next visit, keeping in mind, of course, that any expenditure required to place it in good shape will have to be borne by the school authorities.\n\nInspector Barry also considers that the boilers at this school should be inspected by Mr. Arnall. If you concur in this recommendation you might communicate with Indian Commissioner MacKay and arrange to have Mr. Arnall visit both the Ahousaht and Christie Schools within the next few months.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Alberni, B. C.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nApril 9, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the Christie Residential School Inspector Barry mentions that the windows from the girls' dormitories to the fire escapes are fastened with a padlock. This is contrary to the instructions issued by the Department and I trust that you will make immediate arrangements to have the door leading to the fire escape unlocked whenever the dormitory is occupied.\n\nIf an electric bell were attached in the monitor's room, and a wire run from this to the door, the bell would ring whenever the door opened and the monitor could then investigate the reason. This should be sufficient to prevent any unnecessary entrance to or departure from the dormitory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. H. Melchior, O.S.B.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Residential School,\nKakawis, B. C.\nApril 7, 1938.\n\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report of March 21, 1938:\n\nMay I mention that the windows from the Girls' Dormitories to the fire escape are fastened with a padlock contrary to the instructions of the Department. I spoke of the electric gong system attached to these windows to prevent them being opened, and pointed out to the Principal that the locking of the windows was against Departmental regulations. I asked him to take the matter up with the Department.\n\nIn my last report I mentioned that an oil burning heating system had been placed in the school. May I say that I am not satisfied as to the operation of the burners. There is far too much soot formed showing imperfect combustion. Combustion occurs in the brick chimney overheating this. On opening the furnace doors there is at times a mild explosion. All this points to the immediate need for an overhaul by the Imperial Oil people who placed the system in the school, and I would recommend that the Department insist that this be done under the terms of guarantee given to the school by the Imperial Oil Co. The school is now writing to the Firm in question about this matter.\n\nI wish again to point out the need of a very thorough inspection of all boilers at the school, particularly the High Pressure Boiler in the laundry. I would recommend that Mr. Arnall be asked to make a very thorough inspection of boilers and machinery when this is at all possible. It will be remembered that I asked that the Ahousaht Residential School boiler and machinery should be inspected by Mr. Arnall. He might carry out inspection work here at little extra cost to the Department while on the way back from Ahousaht.\n\nGerald Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nLetter No. 686.C.38.\n\nOffice of the West Coast Indian Agency,\n\nMarch 31, 1938\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 800,\n\namounting to $40.00 in favour\n\nof Principal, Christie Indian Residential School,\nKakawis, B.C.\n\nfor Allowance towards salary of Night Watchman at Christie\nSchool for month of March 1938.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\nLetter No. 159-2-5, dated October 13, 1937.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nof Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. 518\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** Principal,\n\n**ADDRESS:** Christie Indian Residential School\nKakawis, B.C.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Mar. 31 | Allowance towards salary of Night Watchman at Christie School for month of March 1938. | 40.00 |\n\n**Authority:** Department Letter 159-2-6.\nOctober 15, 1937.\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n**FORM No. I.A. 506**\n\n**VOUCHER NO.:** 800\n\n**DATE:** March 31, 1938.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

This latter item was specially requested last fall by the Principal.\n\nBefore giving any consideration to purchase of gymnasium equipment I should appreciate it if you would communicate with the Indian Agent and have him consult the Principal at once with a view to determining in what manner the school management would like to expend the $1100.00 provided in the current year's appropriation.\n\nAs previously explained to you, in the case of Church-owned schools it is impossible for the Department to exceed the amount specifically provided due to the fact that we have already secured an Order-in-Council authorizing the expenditure of the exact amount in the estimates; namely, $1100.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nReference your file 159-0-5 of July 22nd, I regret that Captain Barry's report was omitted from my letter of July 14th.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWith reference to the attached letter 4161/39/D dated June 29th 1939 from Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge, I may say that owing to the location of the Christie Indian Residential School it is not possible to provide for the children very much in the way of the usual outdoor games.\n\nThe actual space around the school is limited, though there is a sandy beach, which might be made more use of I believe; and the weather is mild and very wet. Under the circumstances the more or less constant use of the gymnasium gives the children that physical training which I am trying to encourage in our educational work.\n\nThe need for new schools in various parts of the Province is so urgent that I hesitate to recommend the expenditure of money on less essential projects.\n\nAs the school is willing to meet over half the cost of the gymnasium equipment it may be that the Department could find the $100.00 asked for, and if any funds exist for such a purpose I would recommend that the Reverend Principal's request be granted. I do not however consider the matter a very urgent one at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry.\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOttawa,\nJuly 22, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant in which you state that you are enclosing report from Inspector Barry with reference to a request for a grant of $100.00 for purchase of gymnasium equipment for the Christie school.

(RG 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith application received from Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge, West Coast Agency, for certain improvements and material for the Christie Indian Residential School, in his Agency. I am also enclosing tenders from local firms for the supplies necessary.\n\nIt will be noted that the Agent does not recommend the extension of the girls' dormitory and, in this I agree, but I would recommend that the remainder of the requests, amounting to $236.99 for lumber and $120.00 for hardware be approved. There is also hardware to an amount of $205.06 for the Manual Training department, which I think should be a charge against the B.C. Special Vote. This latter amount I would recommend be allowed from that Vote.\n\nWith reference to the tender for material, I have eliminated the freight, which was variously estimated by the different firms, as in any case this freight is at a set rate charged by the C.P.R., the only available transportation company. As the Agent considers the quality of the material supplied by the Sproat Lake Sawmills to be of better grade and, as their price is cheaper for some of the material, I would recommend that the total order for the lumber be given to them.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to my letter of January 10th, 1940, enclosing application and tenders for certain improvements to Christie Indian Residential School, as the freight rate as charged by the C.P.R. (the only transportation company available) is the same for all companies, I have amended the tenders on a basis of f.o.b. wharf, Alberni, freight extra.\n\nThe Bieddel, Stewart & Welch Co. do not stock a very satisfactory grade of boat lumber, and the Alberni Pacific Lumber Co. can not supply all the requirements. Therefore I would recommend that the order for this material be given to the Sproat Lake Sawmills, who can supply all material in a very good grade. The lumber for the boat slip is the same price from the Sproat Lake Sawmills and the Alberni Pacific Lbr. Co. The remainder of the lumber is cheaper from the Sproat Lake Sawmills, and I would, therefore, recommend that the entire order be given to the Sproat Lake Sawmills Ltd., Kleeceet, B.C.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nP.B.

The Reverend Principal now states that the proposed track cannot be completed at this time, and requests material to carry out:\n\n1. Extension of Girls' Dormitory.\n2. Theatrical stage for Gymnasium.\n3. Construction of boat slip.\n4. Repairs to old boat.\n5. Materials for Manual Training.\n\nTo do all this would cost in the neighborhood of $1200.00 and there is only a balance of $776.94 available, and I would therefore respectfully recommend that items 2, 3, 4 and 5 be granted.\n\nI cannot see any necessity for extending the girls' dormitory, as there is quite sufficient accommodation for all the pupils of this school; also it is not a Department owned building and will soon be in need of extensive repairs.\n\nThe boat referred to is one purchased from Reverend Anthony Terhaar, and is actually not worth five dollars, but the Reverend Principal states that he wishes to give the boys practical training in boat building.\n\nAttached are tenders from all available sources locally, and in the event of the request being granted, I would recommend those of Sproat Lake Sawmills for lumber (except the quotation for girls' dormitory) and the tender of Gordon & Belyea for hardware. This would total approximately:\n\n| Item          | Cost   |\n|---------------|--------|\n| Lumber        | $231.86|\n| Approx. Cartage & Freight | $65.00 |\n| Hardware      | $310.20|\n| Freight       | $14.80 |\n\n$611.86\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6440, file 579-5, part 3)\nIt will be noted that prices quoted are subject to immediate acceptance due to the national emergency, and for this reason as also the desirability of having this work completed before the end of the fiscal year, I would request please that this matter be dealt with as quickly as possible.\n\nThe expenditure of the estimated $611.86, plus $68.55, requested for payment of gymnasium equipment already purchased by the Reverend Principal would about cover the balance of authorized allotment, all labor to be provided by the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

Hoey\n\nWith reference to your two requisitions dated February 5th, your file No. 159-0-5, respecting hardware and building materials required to repair buildings at the Christie Indian Residential School, Kakawis, B.C., these have been approved for local purchase.\n\nTo avoid any great delay at this season of the year, it will be in order to have Indian Commissioner MacKay arrange for local purchase of the materials required from approved firms.\n\nW.M. Bailey\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 12, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 25th ultimo enclosing requisitions for material for the Christie Indian Residential School. Very careful consideration was given to these requisitions and the amount of funds available was also considered and it was decided that we could only allow lumber to the value of $336.99 and hardware to the value of $157.07. I enclose for your information copies of requisitions to which we refer in the above regard. Authority has been received from the Purchasing Agent for you to purchase the items mentioned on these two requisitions from firms on the approved list. You may make immediate arrangements to do so and forward the accounts for payment. When these accounts are received the necessary purchase orders will be secured here.\n\nRegarding the supplies required for the manual training shop at the Christie School the cost of these will be paid from the B.C. Special appropriation. As the end of the fiscal year is approaching our funds are becoming rather limited but it has been decided to allow purchase of supplies for the manual training shop to a value not exceeding $150.00. I attach encumbrance requisition No. 2185 and you may purchase the articles you may consider necessary at a cost not exceeding $150.00. In this connection I attach copy of the requisition received. The last five items do not come within the category of supplies for the manual training shop as they are apparently required for the windows in the building. Consequently they were included in the requisition for hardware for repairs to buildings.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nH.A.

MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge's letter of the 7th instant advising that the Reverend Principal of Christie Indian Residential School has requisitioned for batteries for the school lighting plant and enclosing quotations received from McLennan, McFeely and Prior, and A.H. Johnston of Alberni. In addition to these, I secured a quotation from the Coyle Batteries Ltd., who have been supplying these batteries for other residential schools in this Province and have given very satisfactory service.\n\nThere was no provision made in the school Estimates for the supply of these batteries and I am unable, of course, to say whether funds can be provided but, if so, I would recommend that consideration be given to the quotation of the Coyle Batteries Limited for a set of type V.A.11 235 ampere hour batteries at a cost of $497.70 F.O.B. Vancouver. This type has been found to be most satisfactory for the purpose for which they are required.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 23, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to the necessity of supplying new batteries at the Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $1,000 was included for repairs and improvements and the purchase of new equipment at this school. It is evident from your letter that batteries are required, and you may arrange for their purchase at the cost mentioned, namely $497.70. When forwarding the accounts, you should attach copy of your purchase order.\n\nIt would be appreciated also if you would communicate with the agent and the principal with a view to determining the best manner of expending the balance provided in the current year's appropriation. When requesting that funds be included for this school in the current year's appropriation, mention was made of the necessity for repairing the roof and the boat-house at the school.\n\nAs a matter of information, would you let me know when the last batteries were supplied for the Christie School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of July 29th, 1941, in connection with expenditure of balance of appropriation for Christie School.\n\nDeducting cost of batteries recently supplied, there would be a balance of $503.00 and the Reverend Principal has requested that it be granted for purchase of the following.\n\nFor outside painting - cost as per quotation 236.00\nRepairs to Roof - \" \" \" 46.90\nRepairs to Main Building - \" \" \" 20.80\nFor Manual Training Shop work - \" \" \" 18.60\nLaundry Foundation and floor - \" \" \" 67.13\nOutside walks and approach - \" \" \" 114.67\n\n$503.90\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nPBA/AM\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for, B.C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to your letter of July 23rd, your file 159-0-5, and in this connection beg to enclose a copy of a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge listing the additional repairs, etc., required at the Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nIt will be observed that the cost of materials required is placed at $503.90 and freight charges at $74.90, making a total of $578.80. You might advise if it is the intention to have the school meet the freight charges and your instructions as to placing orders for the above materials would be appreciated.\n\nI take it that the item $18.60 for materials for the Manual Training shop should be deleted from the list and purchased separately as a charge against Vote 79 (B.C. Special).\n\nWe have no record here of the date on which the batteries being replaced were purchased but the Reverend Father Mulvihill refers to this set as having been in service since 1934.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, September 3, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to additional repairs, etc., required at the Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nIn regard to this school I would refer you to my letter of July 23, last, which was written in reply to yours of July 18. That letter authorized purchase of the batteries.\n\nAs you will note from my letter of July 23, there is a balance of $502.30 in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements and the purchase of new equipment at this school, provided the cost of the batteries did not exceed $497.70.\n\nThe total amount of $1,000 cannot be exceeded, and under these circumstances it will not be possible for the Department to pay the freight charges. These will have to be borne by the school management.\n\nA separate account should be forwarded for the item $18.60 covering the cost of materials for the manual training shop. This voucher should be marked \"Pay from B. C. Special\".\n\nWith the above in mind, you can arrange for the materials required for painting, repairs to roof, repairs to main building, repairs to laundry foundation and floor and also new outside walks.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to request authority to employ a night watchman for the Christie Residential School for the usual period, November 1st, 1941 to April 30th, 1942.\n\nThe allowance for previous years for this service was $40.00 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

It is possible that since the estimates were prepared other requirements have developed which may necessitate the money being expended in a different manner than that just stated. It would be appreciated if you would discuss the matter with the Principal at the earliest possible date and forward your recommendations through the office of Indian Commissioner MacKay. In the event of any material or other supplies being required, you should give very detailed information, as this is required by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nDue to present conditions it is most important that we hear from you at the earliest possible date. As you are aware, it is extremely difficult to obtain deliveries on many items and, therefore, the sooner the order is placed the better for all parties concerned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

OF CANADA LTD.\nManufacturers of\nELECTRIC AUTOMATIC REFRIGERATION\n\nJuly 14, 1942.\n\nCanadian Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nP. O. Box No. 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nAttention Mr. D. M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe take pleasure in presenting, for your consideration, our quotation covering a Walk-in Refrigerator and equipment for the Christie Indian Residential School, Kakawis, B. C. It is understood that we would supply a refrigerator 5' x 5' x 6' high inside measurements, insulated with 6\" of Palco wool complete with standard Walk-in door, meat hanger, shelving, and guarantee a temperature of 36\u00b0 F.\n\nEquipment Necessary:\n\n1 - 33/8 1/3 H. P. Universal Condensing unit complete with Briggs's Stratton gas engine.\n1 - cross-fin all copper cooling coil.\n1 - thermostatic automatic expansion valve.\n1 - Silica Cell drier.\n25' of 1\" exhaust piping.\n2 - 90\u00b0 sweep ells.\nAll necessary copper tubing, fittings, and freon refrigerant, completely assembled and guaranteed against any defective part for a period of one year from date of delivery, for the sum of $775.00, f.o.b. Vancouver.\n\nIt is our intention to set up this job complete in Vancouver and run a test on same for several days before it is disassembled and crated for shipment. The coil and the condensing unit would both be installed on one wall of the refrigerator so that it would be quite a simple matter to have the box lagged together when it arrived at Kakawis without having to send a service man to make the installation.\n\nFULLY EQUIPPED REFRIGERATION SERVICE DEPT. \u2014 AUTHORIZED DELCO ELECTRIC MOTOR SERVICE\nThe machine would naturally be manually controlled and the operator of same would have to, from experience, judge the amount of gasoline necessary to put in the tank so that when the engine ran out of gasoline the temperature in the refrigerator would be approximately 34 to 36\u00b0 F. This would also apply to the length of time between cycles, that is when it would be necessary for him to start the machine again. As previously stated, we have figured on insulating the walls of the refrigerator with 6\" of Palco wool, the reason for this being that the more insulation we have, the less often they will have to start the machine.\n\nWe sincerely trust that the above meets with your approval, and should we be favoured with your valued contract, you have our assurance that we will endeavour to merit your confidence by giving you an installation of unquestionable satisfaction.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMACKINNON SALES & SERVICE LTD.\n\nFor\n\nManager\n\nJT/FO\nDr. T.B. Ashbridge  \nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI was disappointed to hear of the Department's ruling. I was under the impression from the Commissioner's letter that it had been approved. I am sure that if they had to eat Bologna for five or six days between boats that they might be willing to grant the request.\n\nI was working under the impression that there would only be $75.00 remaining out of the $950.00 for lumber so I ordered lumber from the A.P.C. for the enclosed amount of $266.57.\n\nAug 17 1942\nhad decided to pay for this from the school. It has not been delivered yet but I understand that it will be on next steamer.\n\nPossibly now the department will consider paying for this in the amount you mention $266.52. The copy you attach adds up to $284.17.\n\nIn addition to this I have ordered windows and doors from Woodwards in amount of $44.40\n\n$310.92. I know this is not the proper procedure and the Department need not pay this amount. However this is an exceptional case in which there has been great delay. I ordered this lumber so that the work might be completed before the rainy season sets in.\nIn reference to the remainder of the grant - since the Douglas fir Board cannot be obtained it would be necessary to have 3000 board feet of V-joint for the ceilings and walls.\n\nFor the remainder of the grant - the board walks on the rear of the building and the incline from the creek are in an advanced stage of decomposition as you have noticed yourself and they are becoming dangerous. It would take 8000 board feet of 2x12's twelve to sixteen feet in length.\n\nHoping that this can be straightened out.\n\nYours Truly\n\nJ.P. Mulvihill\nOttawa,\nOctober 8, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, the Department will allow an amount of $40.00 a month, for the period November 1, 1942, to April 30, 1943, to assist the Principal of the Christie Residential School in employing a night watchman.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. P.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nWest Coast Agency,\nPort Alberni, B.C.,\nOctober 2, 1942.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to request authority to employ a night watchman for the Christie Residential School for the usual period, November 1st, 1942 to April 30th, 1943.\n\nThe allowance for previous years for this service was $40.00 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nFort Alberni, B.C., July 31st, 1942\n\nREPORT ON WEST COAST AGENCY FOR MONTH OF JULY.\n\nChristie Residential school was thoroughly inspected and found to be in first class order throughout.\n\nClassrooms and most of the interior of the main building have been painted and redecorated during the holiday and the whole has a clean and pleasing appearance.\n\nDue to inability to obtain oil for heating purposes, firegrates are being replaced in furnaces and wood or coal will be used.\n\nSome repairs are needed to plank walks, and this is being arranged for.\n\nThe health of the school is excellent and all pupils appear to be happy, well fed and clothed. Meals are well balanced, ample and well cooked.\n\nAttention is being paid to Air Raid and Fire precautions and no undue alarm is being felt or noted following the recent attack on the Coast, north of the school.\n\nP. E. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 5, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo, in connection with the Christie Residential School, the Department approves an expenditure of $266.52 in purchasing the lumber that is required. When forwarding the account you should attach copy of your purchase order.\n\nI regret that favourable consideration cannot be given, at the present time, to supplying a refrigeration unit at this school. A similar request was received from another residential school recently and the opinion was expressed by the Minister's office that such equipment should not be purchased for the duration of the war. If there is any other more available material required the Department will be pleased to receive a further letter from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge's letter of the 29th ultimo advising that the Principal of the Christie Indian Residential School wishes to install a refrigeration unit in the school and purchase lumber. This letter enclosed a quotation dated February 23, 1942, of Messrs., McLennan, McFeely and Prior Limited for the unit at the price of $521.00 f.o.b. Vancouver. Enquiry was made of this firm as to whether their quotation still stood, and they informed me on the 13th instant that it was now impossible for them to undertake the fabricating of Refrigeration equipment for the reason that they have too many government war projects of AIA priorities which will keep them busy for about one year.\n\nMeanwhile I had written to MacKinnon Sales and Service Ltd. for a competitive bid on this unit and enclose same herewith from which it will be observed that they are prepared to supply the complete unit ready for assembly at a cost of $775.00 f.o.b. Vancouver.\n\nThis matter was referred back to Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge and I enclose his letter of the 26th instant together with that of the Reverend Principal of the 25th instant from which it will be observed that it is desired to purchase the unit in question and also some lumber amounting to $266.52. As the amount granted by the Department for this school amounts to $950.00, the Reverend Principal is prepared to pay the difference between the amount allotted and the cost of the articles; namely, $91.52.\n\nI would recommend approval of the application to the amount of the funds available for this purpose.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of July 15th, 1942, in connection with refrigeration requested by Christie Residential School, and to enclose herewith reply received in answer to your enquiry.\n\nIt will be noted that the Reverend Principal makes a request for lumber in addition to the refrigeration, for use in extending classroom, but is willing to pay the difference between the total allotment and cost of lumber shown on the quotation of the Alberni Pacific Lumber Company, enclosed.\n\nReference length of exhaust pipe from engine to exterior of building, the stated length, 25 ft. 1 inch pipe, is correct.\n\nAll labour and freight charges on refrigeration unit are to be borne by the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to Department's letter of June 17th, 1942, in connection with requirements of the Christie Residential School from estimates of current year.\n\nI have interviewed the Reverend Principal who states that he wishes to have the appropriation expended for refrigeration unit and for lumber, details of which I enclose together with quotations received, which I would recommend as the source of supply.\n\nThe refrigeration unit would be valuable to the school particularly at this time, when transportation of food supplies is uncertain, and the lumber asked for is to be used for various repairs, the labour to be supplied by the school.\n\nThe Reverend Principal informs me that in event of the total cost being in excess of the amount allotted the school funds will bear the difference.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPBA/AM\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nRefrigeration Unit\n\nQuotation McLennan, McFeely & Prior. 521.00\nFreight and Labor provided by School.\n\nLumber\n\nQuotation Bloedel, Stewart & Welch. 420.57\nFreight to be paid by School\n\nTOTAL: 941.57\nChristie Indian Residential School\nRakasus, B.C.\n(WEST COAST, VANCOUVER ISLAND)\n\nJuly 25/42\n\nDr. P.B. Ashbridge\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Sir \u2014\n\nI reply to your enclosed letter.\n\nIt will be satisfactory to have the refrigeration unit at the quoted price of $775.00. I will pay the freight charges from Vancouver.\n\nThe question of lumber is also important \u2014 I wish to extend the class-room space. This is to be done in order to use part of the present class-room space for an extension of the girls' dormitory. I think it is important to have more air space per child in the sleeping quarters.\n\nThe amount granted for this year was, I believe, $950.00.\nthe refrigerator is deducted it would leave a sum of $175.00 for lumber.\n\nI am enclosing an estimate from the A.P.L. for $266.52 - Would it be possible to apply this $175.00 on this quotation and I would supply the balance of $91.52?\n\nAnother question - If this could be done would it be possible for me to order this lumber and pay the whole amount and have the department make the charge for $175. Payable to the school.\n\nThe reason for this is I can secure the services of a carpenter next week and I will be unable to do so in a shorter time.\n\nHope this is not too long-winded\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.M.

Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Ashbridge:\n\nFurther to our conversation over the phone regarding our requisition for plumbing materials, I cannot give you any estimate of cost of the toilet complete. It is not necessary to have an expensive one. One of the plainest type would do perfectly well. So far as fittings are concerned we shall want the following:\n\n- 45 feet - 4 inch Cast Iron Soil Pipe\n- 2 Elbows\n- 1 T\n- 60 feet - 4 inch drain tile\n\nAs I said in my previous letter, the lumber for the stairs, etc., can go through the Manual Training account as it will be a bona fide Manual Training project.\n\nThanking you for your assistance in all these things, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRCS/BW\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr P.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nAugust 30th, 1945.\n\nDear Mr Ashbridge:\n\nYou may remember speaking to me once or twice about the advisability of having one of the men staff members sleeping over the boat shop, as a safeguard against fire etc. At the time I did not think it necessary, but lately the more I have thought about it, the more I feel it would be well if we had accommodation for such a man. There is a good brick chimney on the building, and the room is roughed out in one end of the attic. I could get the lumber etc., and we could do the work ourselves, making it a Manual Training project. I do not feel, however, that I can stand the expense of getting a toilet and soil pipe etc.\n\nI would put an outside stair up to a door which we would cut where a window now is. This would give two exits for any man sleeping up there and it would make the room separate from the interior of the building except when the occupant wished to have it otherwise. This would be well as the upstairs is used for a store room and the boys have to go up occasionally.\n\nWe would also put in a septic tank, as part of the above project for the older boys. If the apartment would be good enough to give us the toilet complete along with soil pipe etc., we could manage it nicely, and it would be an added safeguard and that seems to me more and more desirable. We have nails and paint etc., and can finish the room inside. The toilet would cost about $25.00, and the fittings and soil pipe about another twenty dollars. We could do it, I think, for under fifty dollars for these two items.\n\nI trust that you may feel yourself able to recommend this project, and that an amount of not more than fifty dollars be granted by the Department. If the Department cared to buy the toilet, it would then come within a priority rating.\n\nThanking you for your interest in the school generally, and for your suggestion of some time ago, which I hope you can again bring to the notice of the Department, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\nOttawa,\nAugust 31, 1945.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMajor D.M.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe recently wrote to Indian Agent Ashbridge informing him that there was approximately $250.00 unexpended of the amount specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Coqualeetza Residential School. In reply he has forwarded a request from the Principal for purchase of lumber amounting to $395.00 in order to build a boat. The Principal states in his letter that he is prepared to pay any amount over and above the sum available in our appropriation. I enclose the correspondence which has been sent to this office and will appreciate it if you will issue purchase order for the lumber. When submitting your account you should submit the account for the whole amount and we will pay as much as we have on hand. The balance will have to be paid by the Principal and, of course, he should be informed to that effect.\n\nR.A. Hosy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of October 13th, 1943, in connection with available balance of current year's appropriation for Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Reverend Principal requests that he be supplied with boat lumber as per his list attached. The total cost of this would be $323.00 and only one quotation is obtainable. Rev. J. P. Mulvihill, however, states that should this exceed the amount available, the Church will pay the balance, if agreeable to the Department. Kindly instruct me.\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 13, 1943.\n\nMr. P.B. Ashbridge, Indian Agent, Port Alberni, B.C.\n\nAccording to our records we have either expended or approved an expenditure of approximately $550.00 at the Christie Residential School during the current fiscal year. The total amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school is $800.00. If there are any more repairs that are absolutely essential that you consider can be obtained for the balance of the amount available, this letter authorizes you to proceed with the necessary work immediately, in order to have it completed before the close of the fiscal year.\n\nH.A.

Fireweld Anchor Chain, the Company's quotation is somewhat confusing in that they quoted the rate as 100 lbs. at $19.50 per 100 lbs. The weight of 150 ft of such chain is 256 lbs, which at $19.50 per 100 lbs. would total $49.92.\n\nThe 5650 x 20\" Steering Wheel listed on the Purchase Order was supplied and the cost, $11.08, was included in the total of the Company's invoice, but the item itself was not listed.\n\nGordon and Belyea, Limited, have supplied corrected invoices and these, together with the voucher No. 440, duly corrected to read $611.03, and the original invoice, are forwarded herewith.\n| Description                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| 24 FT 14\" DIA X 18 GA HEAVY GALV STOVE PIPE      |          |            |             |\n| 1 Galv 14\" GALV CHIMNEY CAP FOR ABOVE            |          |            |             |\n| 1 Len 14\" X 18GA STOVE PIPE                      |          |            |             |\n| 1 \" 14\" X 18 GA DO                              |          |            |             |\n| 2 Only TANKS 48 x 18 x 16 GA GALV IRON           |          |            |             |\n| WITH FITTINGS PER DIAGRAM                        |          |            |             |\n| 1 \" TANK 36 x 12 x 15 x 18 GA GALV IRON          |          |            |             |\n| WITH FITTINGS                                    |          |            |             |\n| 100 FT 7\" GALV WATER PIPE 1/2\"                  |          |            |             |\n| 104 \" 3\" DO                                     |          |            |             |\n| 5 GALS DRES A FLOR GREY PAINT 1133               |          |            |             |\n| 10 Only X 1 GAL DYKES CREAM PAINT 526            |          |            |             |\n| 10 \" X 1 GAL DYKES WHITE                         |          |            |             |\n| 4 \" X 1 GAL RHINO FLOOR VARNISH                  |          |            |             |\n| 1 \" X 1 GAL SPAR MARINE VARNISH                  |          |            |             |\n| 2 \" X 1 GAL DYKES WHITE PAINT                   |          |            |             |\n| 2 \" X 1 GAL UNION JACK COPPER PAINT              |          |            |             |\n| 13 FT 3/4\" WARTIME VICTORY ROPE                  |          |            |             |\n| 150 \" 3/8\" GALV FIREWELD CHAIN                   |          |            |             |\n| 1 Only 60lb MAV ANCHOR                           |          |            |             |\n| 1 \" 3\" CHAIN DECK PIPE                          |          |            |             |\n| 5\" WATER DECK IRON                              |          |            |             |\n| 1 \" #416 SIZE 3 ROLLER CHOCK                    |          |            |             |\n| 4 \" #411 X 10 GALV STRT CHOCKS                  |          |            |             |\n| 3 \" 409 X 12\" GALV BOAT CLEATS                   |          |            |             |\n\n**Total:** $429.66\n\n**Forward:** $429.66\n| Item Description                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| No 409 x 6 GALV BOAT CLEATS                          | 2        | $33 EA     | $66         |\n| No 536 x 1\u00bd DECKPLATES                               | 3        | $1.59 EA   | $4.77       |\n| No 857 THRU HULL 1\u00bd\" INLET AND OUTLET CONNECTION     | 1        | $2.51 EA   | $2.51       |\n| No 857 DO 3/4\"                                       | 3        | $0.94 EA   | $2.82       |\n| No 1506 x \u00be SEACOCK WITHOUT STRAINER AND THRU HULL   |          |            |             |\n| CONNECTION                                           |          |            |             |\n| No 2 SWAN NECK VENTILATING PIPES                     | 3        | $2.84 EA   | $8.52       |\n| PR No 11 CLASS 2 SAILING LIGHT GALV                  | 1        | $12.08     | $12.08      |\n| No 12 GALV MAST LIGHT                                | 1        | $6.10      | $6.10       |\n| UNITY SEARCHLIGHT 6 VOLT 150                         | 1        | $15.00     | $15.00      |\n| No 1500 SEACLO REGULAR CLOSET                        | 1        | $56.00     | $56.00      |\n| No 875 DOUBLE SPARK & THROTTLE CONTROL               |          |            |             |\n| 3\" DIRIGO SHIPS COMPASS                              | 1        | $5.59      | $5.59       |\n| No 3 \u00bd GALV STANCHION POST                           | 6        | $1.00 EA   | $6.00       |\n\nTotal: $580.64\n\nI hereby certify that the above goods have been received at Christie Residential School in good order.\n\nRev.

I had been requested to obtain this lumber and quotations on this are enclosed; together with the quotations on the Gyproc and the Fairbanks-Morse engine, which is required to operate the lighting plant.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 19th instant with reference to a request of the Principal of the Christie Residential School for a new engine for the generating plant.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, the management of the Christie School for many years past, has urged that some arrangements be made to make easier the unloading of supplies that the school requires.\n\nSome years ago we considered the possibility of building a wharf but the estimated cost of this was very high and at one time a Public Works engineer expressed the opinion that any wharf constructed would probably be damaged severely by the first severe storm.\n\nWe received representations to build a road from the school to the Indian village where wharfage could be secured and boats tied safely. For this purpose we provided an amount of $10,000 in the appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48.\n\nPlease take up the matter with the Principal and decide what can be done regarding the proposed\nroad.\n\nIn the meantime, we approve the purchase of the new engine at a cost of $400, but this authority will reduce the amount provided for the road to $9,600. As you know, Christie is a church-owned school and consequently we are only allowed to expend the amount specifically provided.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept.

It would be appreciated if you would advise if funds are available and if it will be in order to purchase the engine referred to.\n\nD.

This account has been held in this office since April 22nd pending receipt of information from Mr. Indian Agent Garrard as it was thought that the expenditure was a duplication of one made previously, reference, West Coast Agency voucher No. 98. Mr. Garrard assures me however that the materials covered by this voucher are additional to those already supplied and were necessary to carry out recommendations made by the Fire Marshal.\n\nUnder the circumstances the account is recommended for payment and presumably will be charged to the amount provided for repairs and equipment at the Christie School during the present fiscal year.\n\nfor M.

(RG 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 4)\nCHRISTIE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nKakawis, Vancouver Island, B.C.\n\nDate of Visit: September 18 and 19, 1947.\nNumber of pupils in residence: 115\nClass-rooms: 3\n\n| Teacher          | Room     | Desks | Enrolment |\n|------------------|----------|-------|-----------|\n| Sister Justine   | Primary  | 43    | 43        |\n| Rev. M.D. Kearney| Intermediate | 35   | 32        |\n| Sister K. Margaret| Senior   | 41    | 39        |\n\nPrincipal: Rev. P.J. Sheahan\n\nVocational Training:\n\nManual Training:\nThis school appears to be well equipped for courses in both woodwork, metalwork and mechanical training. The Industrial Arts shop contains a circular saw, band saw, wood lathe and small jointer for woodwork, and a large metal work lathe, forge and post drill for metal work. Unfortunately none of these courses were in operation at the time of my visit as the manual training instructor had not reported to the school for duty. I was shown however, two boats made by the pupils, the larger of which had been completed last term. Pictures of these are attached to this report. It is to be deplored that the school is unable to begin its vocational training for these boys at the commencement of the school term.\n\nDomestic Science:\nThe girls participate in the usual activities of sewing, darning, mending and dress-making, and the girls observed doing this work seemed to be quite proficient. It is felt that the work along these lines could be broadened to include home nursing and home making in general, as some of the other residential schools are doing or are planning to do. The older girls assist with the preparation of the school meals.\n\nExtra-Curricular Activities:\nThe chief games at this school are basketball, softball and soccer. Because of the isolation of this school the competitions are almost entirely intra-mural. Other activities consist of parties which are held about once a month, concerts which are held less frequently and moving pictures which are shown two or three times a month. The films are chiefly shown for entertainment although an occasional educational picture is shown. In the late spring and the early fall the pupils swim at the beach.\n\nFire Protection:\n3 Hydrants equipped with 200 ft. of hose in good or fair condition.\n5 Standpipes, each with 50 ft. of hose, in good condition.\n10 Large fire extinguishers which are recharged annually.\n5 Pyrene extinguishers.\n10 Fire buckets, five in each of the dormitories.\nFire Protection (continued):\n\nAn attempt to ring the fire bells disclosed that the batteries which operate this system had run down, and the Principal is having them replaced.\n\nThe Principal states that he has been unable to secure an automatic sprinkler system recommended by the Fire Marshal on the occasion of his last visit. This will be installed in the boiler room as soon as it can be obtained.\n\nDormitories:\n\nThe boys' dormitory is overcrowded and the Principal has already suggested that a new building for a staff residence be erected, and that the quarters now occupied by the staff be converted into additional dormitory space. The provision of one toilet for the number of pupils accommodated is hardly ideal, but this is only for night use and the school is equipped with outside facilities for use by the boys during the day.\n\nThe rooms and linen appeared to be clean.\n\nDining Rooms:\n\nThe dining rooms appeared to be clean and have ample accommodation for the pupils. The food appeared to be of good quality and of ample quantity. A copy of the diet sheet for the week is attached.\n\nWater Supply:\n\nWater is secured from a creek which has been dammed, and water is also stored in a large cistern. It appeared of good quality and sufficient supply.\n\nSanitary Conditions:\n\nIn general the school was reasonably clean. Kitchen, lavatories, toilets and boiler room, as well as the main part of the building, were inspected and found in good condition. The gymnasium however was badly in need of a good cleaning.\n\nHealth:\n\nThe Principal informs me that the pupils are now bathed once a week, instead of once every other week. This necessary change was apparently brought about at the suggestion of Dr. Tennant, Medical Superintendent of the Department of Health and Welfare. The pupils appeared to be in good health. There were no pupils in the infirmary at the time of my visit.\n\nR.F.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 20th instant, file 16-11-3(159) referring to your communication of January 21st. We replied to that letter on January 27th. We also wrote you on February 13th and we enclose another copy of that letter.\n\nAs the matter stands, an amount of $10,000 was provided for the road at the Christie Residential School. We understand from the Lands and Development Services Branch that an amount of $7,500 has been expended. In April last we provided lumber for fire escapes at a cost of $73.26. This makes a total expenditure of $7,573.26 and leaves a balance unexpended of $2,426.74.\n\nAs we informed you in our letter of February 13th, the principal suggested that he be supplied with a tractor, bulldozer and trailer. It is our understanding that he wanted this before any further expenditure was incurred.\n\nHowever, you have the picture before you now, namely, that there is $2,426.74 remaining in the current year's appropriation and as this is a church-owned school the amount actually provided cannot be exceeded. We will be pleased to hear from you what expenditures you recommend should be made from this balance. As the matter stands, we have requests for the equipment mentioned above, also for an oven and for plumbing and heating supplies.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAir Mail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI would refer you to my letter of January 21st in connection with plumbing and building supplies and construction of a road at the Christie Residential School, and would ask if the information requested in the last paragraph of my letter has been received.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nFebruary 13, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 10th instant, file 16-11-4(159) enclosing communication from the principal of the Christie Indian Residential School regarding the need for a new oven. I would appreciate it if you would let me know if an oven can be purchased in Vancouver and if so, at what price.\n\nI would also refer you to Major MacKay's letter of September 25, 1947, your file 16-11-3. You will note from that letter that the principal requested to be supplied with a tractor, bulldozer blade and trailer at a cost of $1,521.15. Please let us know if this price still holds and if so, the name and address of the firm from whom the quotation was received.\n\nWhen we receive the two quotations requested in this letter we will be in a position to decide if we can supply one or both of them from the balance remaining over and above the cost of the road.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/EGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Gerrard's letter of February 3rd and communication dated January 19th from the Reverend Principal of the Christie Indian Residential School regarding the need for a new bakery oven at the school.\n\nMr. Gerrard has not contributed very much to the Principal's submission but it is intended to have him look into the matter further on his next trip up the Coast. In the meantime I would appreciate being advised if it is likely that the Department can make funds available for the purchase of a new oven this year and if so if you would like me to secure tenders in Vancouver.\n\nW.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nW. S. Arneil, Esq.\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nBox 70\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nWith reference to the enclosed letter from Rev. P. J. Sheahan of Christie Residential School.\n\nAs this school would have great difficulty in obtaining bread, I would recommend that a new bakery oven with an oil burning heating unit be supplied.\n\nN. W. Garrard\nIndian Agent\n\nNWG/H\nCHRISTIE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nKakawis, B. C.\nJan. 19, 1948\n\nMr. N. W. Garrard\nIndian Agent\nAlberni, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Garrard:\n\nDue to the fact that I was new on the job as Principal when making up my requisitions, I overlooked some materials and replacements necessary for the proper maintenance of the school.\n\nAfter several attempts to repair our Bakery Oven we find that our efforts are in vain. The oven is completely burned out. The bread is coming out black with smoke and it is almost impossible to get up enough heat to even bake the bread properly.\n\nBuying bread would not be practical here. First of all it would double the cost of the bread. Secondly we cannot buy it locally but would have to have it shipped in from Port Alberni. As it is a perishable commodity there would be the risk of having entire lots spoiled beyond use. Lastly the children would be deprived of the opportunity of learning to bake bread.\n\nIn view of the above mentioned facts I am asking the Department for a complete new Bakery Oven with a capacity for two hundred loaves with an oil burner heating unit.\n\nHoping you can look into this matter as soon as possible as it is an emergency,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(signed) Rev. P. J. Sheahan O.M.I.\nPrincipal\nJanuary 27, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 21st instant, file 16-11-3 enclosing requisition for materials requested by the principal of the Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nWe are making another endeavour to ascertain definitely how much was spent on constructing the road. As soon as we have this information we will give further consideration to the requisition that you recently forwarded.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MDG\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Garrard's letter of January 15th and requisition covering plumbing and building supplies required for the Christie Indian Residential School at an approximate cost of $1500.00. It is understood that the total appropriation for this school during the current fiscal year is $10,000 of which an unknown amount has been spent for the construction of a road to the school, in addition to which we are holding in abeyance an application from the Reverend Principal for the supply of a tractor, reference Mr. Neary's letter of October 18th. I should appreciate being advised if the Department has as yet been informed of the final cost of the road construction.\n\nD. M.

C.\n\nEnclosed are quotations for material required by the Principal of the Residential School at Kakawis. I have endeavoured to obtain quotations on all the necessary articles but cannot obtain prices on the soil pipe, soil pipe bends, wash basins and toilet sets. Gordon & Belyea quote on hardware and Blowdel, Stewart & Welch on lumber.\n\nThis amount involved totals $1,010.10. This does not include 300 sacks of cement, which would be $430.31 delivered.\n\nIn the estimates for 1947-48 an amount of $900.00 is requested for this school. If half of the amount of plywood were supplied, the total amount allowed in the estimates would be sufficient.\n\nWith reference to Father Sheahan's request for a Skill Saw. The principal contemplates extensive changes in the inside of the school. He wishes to build additional dormitories where the staff now have their quarters and build new quarters for the staff. The Skill Saw would be put to good use in the above described work, and it is suggested that it be paid for out of the B. C. Special Vote.\n\nN. W.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOttawa, March 15, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nDuring the summer of 1947 a road was constructed from Opitsat Village to the Christie Indian Residential School in order that the school boat could be anchored in a sheltered harbour. The work was done under the direction of the Lands and Development Services Branch.\n\nProvision of this road was extremely necessary as for many years past the school authorities have had difficulty in landing supplies and have frequently lost supplies due to the heavy surf.\n\nIn order to keep this road in proper condition the Indian Commissioner at Vancouver writes as follows:\n\n\"Christie Residential School is extremely isolated; facilities in the way of equipment at other residential schools are not available here and in view of this, the principal's request for a tractor is considered reasonable in order to keep the road in proper condition.\"\n\nIndian Commissioner Arneil has obtained a quotation from Chatwin Motors, Ltd., Alberni, B.C. This quotation is attached. Funds are available in the current year's appropriation and I would appreciate it if you would authorize the purchase so that payment can be made before the end of March.

As soon as you forward the quotation in writing from Chatwin Motors we are prepared to submit their quotation for approval by the Minister's office. We understand from your letter that Chatwin Motors have the tractor on hand and consequently if we receive the Minister's approval, delivery can be made before the end of March and permit us to pay for it from the current year's appropriation.\n\nIf you can secure a suitable bake oven for less than $500.00 and can be assured of delivery before the end of March, you may do so. However, it is noted from the quotation supplied to you by McLennan McFeely and Prior that they would be unable to deliver the oven on which they quote for three months. This would mean that the cost of the oven would have to be charged to the appropriation for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nThe construction of the road from Opitsat Village to the Christie Residential School was necessary to permit the school boat to be anchored in a sheltered harbour. Opitsat Village is situated on an sheltered inlet, approximately 1\u00bd miles by the shortest route from the school.\n\nOpitsat is about 2 miles from Tofino, a regular port of call for coastwise steamships. Deep water is found close in shore at Opitsat and boats up to 40 ft. long can use the harbour at all times.\n\nThe provision of this road was extremely necessary as for many years past the school authorities have had difficulty in landing their supplies and have frequently lost supplies due to the heavy surf.\n\nIn order to keep the road in proper condition the equipment requested on this requisition is extremely essential.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner's office reports as follows regarding the request:\n\nChristie Residential School is extremely isolated; facilities in the way of equipment at other residential schools are not available here and in view of this, the principal's request for a tractor is considered to be reasonable.\n\nE.l\nMarch 2nd, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Christie Residential School\n\nYour File 159-0-5 [F.1]\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of February 26th regarding the unexpended balance of the appropriation for the above mentioned school and the suggestion that these funds be used for the purchase of a tractor, bulldozer and trailer and for a new bake oven, Mr. Garrard has advised that the tractor and equipment which he originally quoted on is not now available from Chatwin Motors, Alberni, B.C., but they have for immediate delivery a tractor of more recent design priced at $1,358.00, and an angle bulldozer blade at $95.32. The price on the trailer apparently was obtained from Simpson's Ltd., Regina - $151.75 (plus freight).\n\nWith regard to the bake oven, I have secured the attached quotation from McLennan, McFeely and Prior, Ltd., Vancouver, on an oven of 100-loaf capacity, and I am presently awaiting a quotation from Marshall Wells, B.C. Ltd., who have airmailed eastern Canada for details with respect to price and delivery. I am writing to Mr. Indian Agent Garrard asking him to secure and forward a quotation in writing from Chatwin Motors and will forward this and further quotations on a suitable bake oven as soon as possible.\n\nW.

The work was done under the direction of the Lands and Development Services Branch.\n\nProvision of this road was extremely necessary as for many years past the school authorities have had difficulty in landing supplies and have frequently lost supplies due to the heavy surf.\n\nIn order to keep this road in proper condition the Indian Commissioner at Vancouver writes as follows:\n\n\"Christie Residential School is extremely isolated; facilities in the way of equipment at other residential schools are not available here and in view of this, the principal's request for a tractor is considered reasonable in order to keep the road in proper condition.\"\n\nIndian Commissioner Amos has obtained a quotation from Chatwin Motors, Ltd., Alberni, B.C. This quotation is attached. Funds are available in the current year's appropriation and I would appreciate it if you would authorize the purchase so that payment can be made before the end of March. This is a church-owned school operated under Roman Catholic auspices.\n\nDirector\nMr. W.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner,\nFederal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nReference your letter March tenth minister approved purchase from Gravine Motors of tractor, universal frame and blade for Christie Residential School at total cost $1,553.18 (stop) account should be dated previous to March thirty first as funds available in 1947-48 appropriation.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept.

Principal of the school with a request that he indicate which oven would be most suitable. Father Sheahan apparently considers the oven covered by the attached quotation from Kirkland and Rose to be most suitable and the cost, although considerably in excess of what we had anticipated it would be, is less than prices quoted by other suppliers.\n\nMay I suggest that if the Department does not consider this oven suitable or if the price appears to be high that the Departmental Purchasing Agent might be in a better position to secure quotations in eastern Canada.\n\nW.

I am getting anxious as we would like if we are getting one that we could have it installed before the children return to school.\n\nThe information I forwarded to you through the Agent I obtained by mail. Since then I have been into the office of Kirkland and Rose and found that the oven called for a lot of reinforcement, while there I found that I could get another oven somewhat the same as we have here which is lighter and calls for no extra reinforcement and can be purchased a little less than the one quoted. If you are putting in the order I would rather you order a No. 4 Bramford Oven.

His reply of December 31st, 1948, is enclosed and in view of his comments regarding the hot water tank, I would ask that the Department endeavour to make further funds available for the purchase of this piece of equipment, or otherwise, if it would be in order to purchase the tank prior to March 31st, on the understanding that the account would not be paid until after April 1st, 1949.\n\nW.S.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Arneil:\n\nThe news contained in your letter received last evening is not very encouraging in as much as the school has not yet benefited from the items stated to have been spent on the school. The Bake Oven, though asked for nearly a year ago has not been received, the $700 was spent to no advantage, the $500 has not all been spent.\n\nThere was $3500, a special grant over and above the regular requisition, which I may say did not get a chance to spend. I did my part by sending in the itemized list of requirements on November 1947. Now a year has gone by and I have so far received nothing to the advantage of the school, except whatever the money spent on the road might be considered as an advantage.\n\nRe the hot water tank, I hope that order has gone in and it can be made an emergency. This is an emergency. I need it and need it badly. Would like to hear from you on this item.\n\nOtherwise everything is going nicely here at the\nJanuary 5, 1949,\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo regarding the Christie Residential School, it will not be possible for us to authorize the purchase of the fire hose at the present time owing to the lack of funds.\n\nIn this connection, I attach copy of official letter of December 17, 1948 which apparently had not reached you when you wrote your letter of December 28th.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nPP/HHN.\n\nEncl:\nDecember 28th, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa\nRe: Christie Indian Residential School\nYour File 150-1-5\n\nMr. J.E. Halsall, Dominion Boiler Inspector, in his report of August 30th, 1948, regarding the machinery at the Christie Indian Residential School, recommended the provision of fire hose for the outside hydrants. Superintendent Garrard has now submitted a requisition for 300 ft. of hose but before calling for tenders on this equipment I would ask you to please advise if the necessary funds can be made available, having in mind that purchase of the new bake oven and expenditures for improvements to the road serving the school, may have entirely depleted the appropriation.\n\nW.S.

Ltd., Port Alberni, on lumber, etc., required for repairs and maintenance at the Christie Residential School.\n\nAccording to information provided by the Rev. Principal, the flooring is required for the gymnasium, which according to Inspector Davey is urgently in need of repairs. The lumber and shingles are required for roofing the water tank, the hardboard for lining the boys' playroom and the plywood for boat construction.\n\nFather Sheahan considers that the balance of the funds appropriated for the school this year could be spent to the best advantage in the purchase of these materials and I would recommend that lumber, etc., to the extent of the funds available be ordered by the Purchasing Agent.\n\nW.

The latter amount includes the cost of desks and some small accounts which were charged against the appropriation.\n\nFrom the information contained in the preceding paragraph, you will note that the balance available is $2,245.17.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nJanuary 11, 1950.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Christie Residential School\n\nIn my letter to you of August 17th, 1949, I advised that Father Sheehan, Principal of the Christie School, was of the opinion that the $500.00 available from the appropriation for the School could be spent to the best advantage on further repairs and improvements to the School road and apparently an accountable advance for this purpose was sent to Superintendent Gerrard.\n\nThe Reverend Principal, reference Mr. Gerrard's letter of January 5th, attached, has apparently reconsidered and would now prefer to spend approximately $320.00 of the amount for the purchase of fire hose. I understand that the condition of the road is such that the expenditure of $500.00 for repairs at this time of year would be wasted and, therefore, recommend that the purchase of fire hose be approved.\n\nWill you please advise if the advance should be returned to the Department and payment for the hose made by voucher or if it will be in order for Mr. Gerrard to pay for the hose from the advance.\n\nW.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nWest Coast Indian Agency,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nJanuary 5, 1930\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Christie Residential School\nYour file 16-11-3 and 16-11-4\nDept. File No. 879-5\n\nI wish to refer to the accountable advance in the amount of $500 that is held in the Agency Trust Account for repairs and improvements on the road from Christie school to Opitsat Indian Reserve. It was apparent that the most urgent requirements of the school during the summer months were repairs to the school road; however, since the amount available could not exceed $500, Rev. Sheahan reconsidered this matter and feels that these funds would be used to a better advantage if spent on a fire hose.\n\nHe indicated that the purchase of the fire hose is now considered more essential than repairs to the road, and should be given top priority. Should the amount of $519.00 be authorized, as per enclosed quotations, for this expenditure, the balance that is still available would be expanded for improvements to sections of the school road that require immediate attention. I would recommend that the school be provided with this equipment from the accountable advance of $500.00, and your favourable consideration would be greatly appreciated.\n\nUnder separate cover I am today forwarding a sample of the fire hose required by Christie School.\n\nN.W.

The local district engineer of the Department of Public Works has reported stating that he could not recommend the erection of a wharf which would be of service to the school only, inasmuch as it would necessitate an approach of approximately 1400 feet. He suggests as an alternative the provision of a floating boat-house moored close to the shore, into which the dory, used for landing supplies shipped to the school, could be placed when the steamer arrives during the night or in rainy weather.\n\nI have been asked for an expression of opinion as to whether this might be considered urgent work and I shall be glad if you will let me have a report with as little delay as possible as I have nothing before me now from any of our own officers that would enable me to come to a decision.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent-General.\n\nChas. A. Cox, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlberni, B. C.\nDecember 19, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant in further reference to the proposed construction of a boat house at Kakawie, Vancouver Island. In reply I beg to say that from the information before me I am unable to say whether this work is really urgent or not, and I would propose to refer the matter to our local agent for report. This I shall do at once and communicate again with you, hoping that it may not be too late for consideration with your estimates.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nH.

This information is required in connection with the preparation of our Estimates for Parliament.\n\nC/M Secretary.\nDecember 12, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the request made by Mr. Chas. Moser of the Christie Indian Industrial School at Eskawis, Vancouver Island, B.C., for the erection of a boat-house instead of a wharf at that place, I beg to say that we cannot give this matter consideration as there are no funds available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAast. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. C. Desrochers, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ont.\nA communication has been received from the Chief Engineer of the Public Works Department which states that the District Engineer for Victoria, B.C., does not recommend the building of a wharf as requested by Mr. Charles Moser of the Christie Indian Industrial School at Kakawis, B.C., which wharf would be used for the landing of supplies shipped to this school. The reasons given by the Acting District Engineer appear to justify his decision. As an alternative it is suggested that a floating boat-house be built which would cost $1400.00, providing the work is performed under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department. This building would meet the requirements of both the school and the captain of the C.F.R.SS. Princess Maquinna who has charge of the delivery of goods at that point.\n\nThe above mentioned school is the property of the R.C. Church. Would you kindly advise whether the Department is prepared to provide funds for the granting of the above mentioned work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mitchell, our Acting\nDistrict Engineer at Victoria, B.C., in which he states\nwith regard to the request made by Mr Chas. Moser of the\nChristie Indian Industrial School at Kakawis, Vancouver\nIsland, B.C., that a wharf be constructed at that place,\nthat he does not recommend the construction of a wharf;\nbut that instead a boat house at a cost of $1400 be built.\n\nKindly advise me as to whether your Depart-\nment considers this matter to be urgent.\n\nEnc.\nReport.\n\nSecretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 6)\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS, CANADA.\nDISTRICT ENGINEER'S OFFICE.\n\nVICTORIA, B.C., November 24, 1919.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 17th inst., I would not recommend the construction of a wharf at Kakawis, B.C., because the captain of the C.P.R.SS. PRINCESS MAQUINNA stated that he would be unable to make landings at either of two points where a wharf could be constructed, with a fairly short approach. In addition there is no road to either of these points from the Indian School which is the only settlement that would benefit by the construction of a wharf. To construct a wharf fronting the school house having a depth of 16 feet at low water at its face would necessitate an approach of approximately 1400' in length and I do not consider that this expenditure would be justified in view of the fact that the Department is already maintaining two wharfs at Tofino and Clayoquot respectively, which are both within two miles of this site.\n\nAn alternative suggestion would be the provision of a floating boat house moored close to the shore into which the dory used for landing supplies, shipped to the Indian school by the SS. PRINCESS MAQUINNA could be placed at such times as this vessel arrives during the night or in rainy weather and these supplies could then be left in the boat house under shelter until it was convenient for same to be removed to the Indian school. The estimated cost of a boat house of this description is $1400 and I am of opinion that this would meet their needs, assuming that a work of this description would be one coming under the jurisdiction of the Department of Public Works.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(SGD) A. F. MITCHELL.\nActing District Engineer.\n\nEugene D. Lafleur, Esq.,\nChief Engineer, P.M.D.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEMB.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your communication bearing date of Dec. 19th which has reference to the construction of a deck or floating boat-house at the Christie Industrial School. The erection of a wharf which would be of service to the School would be a very costly undertaking and would not be used sufficiently to warrant the heavy expenditure. I am therefore strongly of the opinion that a floating boat-house is the only practical solution to the question and then it will be a problem to meet same so as to withstand storms. At this point there is always a heavy swell rolling in during stormy weather as well as very strong tides throughout the year. The successful mooring of a floating boat-house would be the most difficult part of an undertaking of this nature and while it would certainly be a great convenience to the School I would not consider it or sufficient urgency as to necessitate immediate construction and might further add that it is only during the summer months that work of this nature can be successfully carried on at this point.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nJanuary 8, 1830.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 19th ultimo, with regard to the proposed construction of a boat-house at Kakawin, Vancouver Island, I may say that I am now in receipt of the required report from our local Agent in connection with this subject. Our Agent states in this report that the erection of a wharf which would be of service to the school would be a very costly undertaking and would not be used sufficiently to warrant the heavy expenditure, and suggests that a floating boat-house would be the only practical solution of the question. He further states that the matter is not one of great urgency, and that as a matter of fact work of this nature in this particular spot can only be carried out successfully during the summer months.\n\nIt would not seem, therefore, that any further action is necessary for the present with respect to this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 6)\nFROM: The Secretary,\nDepartment of Public Works.\n\nTO: The Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWould you be good enough to let me have a reply as soon as possible, as to whether the work of constructing a boat house at Kakawis, Vancouver Island is urgent. This refers to your letter of December 19, 1919, file 181717-5.\n\nSecretary.\nWHARF: The landing conditions here are not good. It is, owing to the surf, necessary to go ashore in a small boat. The bay is very shallow. When I reached the school the Principal made a long statement, the main points of which are mentioned below.\n\nThe Rev. Father in part stated that he very much wants some sort of wharf. He stated that there is very great danger in conveying the children by means of his flat bottom freight boat to the C.P.R. ship. It will of course be understood that the C.P.R. ship must anchor well out in deep water.\n\nThe Principal states that accidents have only been narrowly averted during the last two years. He considers that should such an accident happen, there will be great loss of life. The children, he states, get sick boarding the C.P.R. Maquinna. There is a rocky point near the school. At this point he thinks the water would be deep enough for the Maquinna. He goes on to say that YOUNG boys have been out from 12:30 A.M. to 6 A.M. three times to land freight. He tells me that The Right Rev. Bishop Gerald Murray has taken up this question with the Department at Ottawa.\n\nREPORT ON ABOVE: As the construction of a Wharf would involve the Department in considerable expenditure I went into the matter with the greatest care.\n\nAt the nearest point to the school the Indian Agent and the Engineer of the Department's boat took eight soundings while I carried on the inspection of the school. It was found that the water is much more shallow than was at first supposed. In a direction W. by S. from the point soundings were taken for a distance of 400 feet. They were in feet 6, 6, 7, 8, 10, 10, 12. It is therefore evident that no wharf could be placed off the nearest point to the school buildings.\n\nSoundings were then taken off the next point. The water here is 15ft deep at a point 30ft from the shore. At about 50ft out the water is 25ft deep. There is then a sudden drop to deep water. For the first 40ft or so the bottom is rock, and piles could not be driven. From 50ft out the water is too deep for piles. A very important note has been suggested by the Captain of a coasting steamer. It is to the effect that for such a wharf to be of any use by such a ship as the Maquinna there would have to be from two to three hundred feet available, where the ship could tie up and still be in deep water. No ship could tie up at a wharf parallel with the coast here, as the place is open to the S.E. winds from the direction of Leonard Islands.\n\nFrom the result of these soundings, it is quite evident that however much a wharf is required at this school, the fact remains that the construction of such a wharf here is impossible.\n\nThe question of a road to the second of the points mentioned above was also looked into. It was found that such a road would in one place have to drop suddenly about 50 feet. This would make the construction a very costly matter. The point is likewise not situated on the school property. A long wharf of 200 to 300 feet off this point would also probably be considered a menace to navigation. It is hard to explain all the above points without a large scale chart; but it may be taken for granted that the construction of a wharf at the Christie Indian Residential School is out of the question from a practical point of view.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I may say that since that time I have had personal conversation with the District Assistant Engineer of the Dominion Public Works Department in connection with this subject and he informed me that some years ago he made a report at the request of Reverend Father Charles, then Principal of the Christie School, and the only solution to the difficulty that he could recommend would be the building of a large float on which there was to be a freight shed.

Mr. Mitchell has about finished his work.\n\nIn a conversation with him on the subject, he remarked that the wharf at $15,000.00 would be quite expensive. I assured him that I could not take that view of the matter. Regarded solely from the standpoint of its being a wharf like any other, that sum might be looked upon as being high. But a wharf at Kakawis must be considered as being an integral and important part of the institution itself, and playing a most necessary roll in the activities carried on by it. It is its freight and express terminal. Through it pass the mail.\n\nAgain, for instance, where other schools have farms which must be equipped with expensive farm machinery and cattle to carry on, products from such a source used at Christie School must pass over the wharf; so that if the region and climate in which our institution is located militate against our procuring the benefits that come from expenditures on a farm, at least, it would seem, we are entitled to expenditures on ways and means that could effect procuring the substitutes for these benefits from being the difficult, laborious and dangerous task it is.\n\nI trust, Mr. Ferrier, that the Department will approve the construction of a wharf at Kakawis.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nVictor Rascher\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\nAlberni, B.C., August 6th, 1932\n\nA.S. Williams Esq.,\nActing Supt Gen of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPlease let me have replies to following questions concerning public matter.\n\n1. Have you been requested to have built a wharf in the vicinity of Kakaweis Indian School in Clayoquot Sound?\n2nd. If so, by whom and on whose recommendation?\n3rd. Have you had a survey made by an engineer?\n4th. What was his report as to possibility and suitability and cost?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.W. Neill\nSir,\n\nAs instructed, I made an investigation of conditions at Kakawis, in connection with proposed wharf at that place.\n\nDuring school periods there are about one hundred and twenty-five staff and Indians resident at the school, and I am informed that about 250 tons of general freight are received per annum, while 100 tons of coal were being unloaded on the beach while I was there, representing one year's requirements.\n\nFronting the school is a sandy beach affording good driving for piles, but, as this beach extends to deep water on a very gradual slope, a wharf with sufficient depth of water to accommodate C.F.R. steamers would have to be of the following dimensions:\n\nWharfhead, 40 feet x 30 feet;\nApproach, 1,050 feet x 12 feet;\nWith freight shed and landing steps for small boats.\n\nThe cost of a wharf at this site, using creosoted piles, would be approximately $20,000.00.\n\nTo the North-West of this beach is another smaller sandy beach, where indications also appear favourable for driving piles. At this site a wharf of the following dimensions would be needed:\n\nWharfhead, 80 feet x 40 feet;\nApproach, 630 feet x 12 feet;\nFreight shed and landing steps.\n\nThe cost of a wharf at this site would be approximately $14,000.00.\n\nA road, 1,200 feet in length, would be required at the latter site built through heavy timber to connect the school with the wharf, and could be built on a gradient of 1 in 30. Northwesternly of the small bay above referred to, deep water gradually approaches much closer to the shore. The beach, however, consists of rock and large boulders, and fronting the beach are considerable bodies of kelp, indicating rock with small probability of affording holding ground for piles.\n\nKakawis is situated on Deception Channel and any wharf site in the vicinity is subject to the serious disability of being exposed to the direct swells from the open Pacific Ocean via Broken Channel. There are also currents running in Deception Channel at a speed of from two to five knots.\n\nIt must, therefore, be anticipated that any wharf constructed would be subjected to considerable impact at times from steamers when making landings, and the maintenance costs of a wharf would, in consequence, be correspondingly increased.\n\nJ.P. Forde,\nDistrict Engineer P.W.D.\nVictoria, B.C.\nI have discussed the matter with the Master of C.P.R. s.s. \"Princess Norah\" who has an intimate knowledge of local conditions and, in his opinion, which I feel sure is correct, landings could be made at a wharf during good weather conditions in the summertime, but during the Fall and Winter months he considers that there would be fairly frequent occasions on which landings would not be possible.\n\nGeneral conditions, are, therefore, unfavourable but if it is considered by the Department of Indian Affairs that the somewhat limited advantages obtainable by building a wharf here would be worth the initial and future maintenance costs which would be involved, I shall be pleased to receive your further instructions in the matter.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nA.F.

McGill,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter trying every possible method to solve the freight problem at this institution and having met with failure in each instance I have decided that something must be done to obtain a wharf. The steamer comes here every ten days bringing the necessities of life and our freight is always heavy. We must go out in a scow and land the freight on the beach which is always very rough. Invariably the waves break over the boat subjecting everybody and everything to a cold salt water bath. Last week fifty tons of coal came by steamer since no one else would handle it for us. The coal was landed at wharves two and one half miles away. We made twelve trips in our small scow to bring the coal to our beach. The scow would not ride up on the beach so we were compelled to walk in water up to our waists and carry sacks weighing on the average of one hundred and twenty pounds. Some of the sacks had to be thrown from the boat into the water in order to save the scow from going to pieces. These sacks, nine hundred of them, had to be carried some two hundred yards to the bottom of the slip. Every day for a solid week the boys and myself were wet all day. It looked like old slave days and that is a common occurrence every boat day.\n\nI have obtained estimates from a very good man who has had experience in building wharves along this particular coast. He puts the cost at five thousand dollars. I would therefore appeal to the Department to do something for us to alleviate this back breaking job which is a menace to life and good health. Hoping to hear from you very favourably in the near future, I am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 6)\nNovember 7, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, requesting that a grant be provided to cover the cost of building a wharf at the Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nThe question of building a wharf at your school has been brought to the Department's attention on several occasions in the past. In 1935, the Senior Assistant Engineer of the Public Works Department reported regarding a wharf; and, for your information, I enclose copy of this report.\n\nYou will note that, in spite of the large expenditure that would be involved, the Engineer considered general conditions were unfavourable. Under these circumstances, the Department is not prepared to consider the erection of a wharf at the Christie School.\n\nIt has been suggested that, if a warehouse was built at Tofino, the C. P. R. boat could discharge all freight for the Christie School at that point and place same in the warehouse. In order to transport the freight from Tofino to the school, it would be necessary to employ a suitable flat-bottomed snow, which could be employed by one of the school launches and arranged in such a manner as to have the snow reach the school at high tide, so that it could be brought in as close to the shore as possible. When the tide went out, the snow could be unloaded. The Department realizes that it is necessary for the Christie School to buy their supplies in advance, and, if the suggestion made in this letter is feasible, the freight could be brought from Tofino on those days when weather conditions are suitable.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to the Indian Agent, and he is being instructed to visit the Christie School at an early date and discuss with you the Department's suggestion for handling the freight. If the plan as outlined could be put into effect, the Agent and yourself should obtain estimates of the cost of erecting a warehouse at Tofino and the purchase of a suitable flat-bottomed snow. This information should then be forwarded for the Department's consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Bertrand McLoughlin, O.S.B.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Indian Residential School,\nKakawin, B.C.\nI have read all your former communications subject of a proposed wharf and am therefore familiar with all the objections hitherto brought up which militate against it.\n\nNow, therefore, I am going to ask the Department to grant us the sum of $3000.00 with which to construct a wharf, landing platform, and a road from the wharf point to the School. This is less than half what the Department had at one time estimated this work would cost. I have these figures from practical men here on the bay and from the parties who are now constructing the dock at Ahousat. I would propose that a wharf be built following plans and specifications of the Ahousat wharf with modifications to suit local conditions.\n\nI will state, for your information, that my father was a building contractor and that I have, all my life, lived in an atmosphere of construction work. And for this particular type of work I will say also that for forty years I have lived on the Ocean shore and I understand and am very familiar with ocean currents, etc. Though I am a priest for nearly twenty-five years, I have been very busy building up four parishes and assisted in the construction of buildings at our Monastery to the value of over four hundred thousand dollars. I mention this because I wish you to realize that I do consider my opinion of some value when it comes to matters of this kind.\n\nI earnestly pray that you will, at this time, grant a favourable hearing on this very important matter, and after receiving this assurance from you I will be pleased to give you more details of what we have in mind.\n\nBelieve me, dear Sir, to be,\n\nGratefully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is the first time I have inspected this agency since Mr. Ashbridge took over.\n\nMr. Ashbridge also informs me that a road has been constructed from the Indian reserve near Tofino to the Christie School. This should solve the landing of goods and freight at the Christie School, which has been very difficult up to now.\n\nGeo. S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to reply to your letter of November 8th., in connection with the request of the Principal of the Christie Indian Residential School for the erection of a wharf.\n\nIn obedience to your request the writer visited the School and discussed the matter with the Rev. Principal and pointed out to him the prohibitive cost of erecting and maintaining a wharf of sufficient strength to withstand the rough weather peculiar to this coast. I also took up the further suggestion as contained in your letter of December 5th., and beg to report that the Rev. Principal is satisfied to withdraw his request for a wharf and to leave the matter of widening the trail and repairing of the wharf at the Opitsaht Reserve until such time that the writer can visit this School with the Dept. Launch and go fully into the matter and prepare estimates of cost involved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, December 5, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn the 8th ultimo, an official letter was directed to you in connection with the request of the Principal of the Christie Indian Residential School for the erection of a wharf. Since writing that letter the Department has received the following suggestion:\n\n\"There is a sheltered wharf that is used by the Indians of the Opitsaht Reserve and there is a trail from this wharf to the Christie School. The distance is approximately 20 minutes walk from the wharf to the school. This trail has been brushed out and is planked for nearly the entire distance. The trail could be broadened out and a light truck purchased for transporting school freight. It is further stated that the wharf on the Reserve is only five minutes by launch from Tofino Wharf, where there is a freight shed that could house the goods going to Christie School. Furthermore, if this suggestion was adopted, the school supplies could be taken from Tofino to the wharf at the Opitsaht Reserve by the launch at present owned by the school.\"\n\nI would appreciate if you would also discuss this suggestion with the Reverend Principal of the School. In the event of you and he agreeing that the above is practical, the Department wishes to know the approximate expense that would be incurred in fixing the wharf at the Opitsaht Reserve and widening the trail to a sufficient width to permit a truck to pass over it. You should also let me know the approximate cost at which a second-hand truck could be secured.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP. J. Ashbridge, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nB.C.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to communicate with the Department re proposed wharf or landing or means of communication between Christie School and Tofino, B.C.\n\nIn this connection, one of the chief difficulties that is experienced at Christie School is the landing of pupils, as the boat often reaches this point at night. It readily can be seen that it is extremely difficult to take a lot of children ashore through breaking surf. This condition exists quite frequently on the beach in front of Christie School. Freight is also very difficult to land at times, and much has been written the Department re this matter. It is felt that the Department is fully aware of the difficulties and the danger of this landing, and the following suggestions are respectfully submitted, and have been arrived at after much thought and many surveys of the district.\n\nThe writer has observed conditions at this point for many years, and it appears that there is only one satisfactory way to overcome these difficulties. A wharf is obviously out of the question. Its construction would of necessity cost a great deal, and the upkeep would be prohibitive. There is in addition the fact that it is very difficult to drive piles in that locality, as the holding ground is not sufficiently deep above bed rock. The Department's suggestion of a warehouse at Tofino and a flat-bottomed boat or scow to be landed on the beach at high tide, is a very good one, but would not be practical in winter, when south east gales drive directly on this beach and raise a surf that is sometimes four and five feet high. The writer has several times attempted to land with a boat or canoe and found it impossible to do so, and in several instances officers of the Department have\nbeen precipitated into the water. There is, however, a sheltered wharf that is used by the Indians of the Opitsaht Reserve, and a trail that is approximately twenty minutes walk from the wharf to the school. This trail has been brushed out and is planked for nearly the entire distance. The wharf, however, at the reserve end would need repairs. This would be, in the writer's opinion, the only safe way to land children at the school safely at all times of the year. The trail could be broadened out and a light truck purchased for transporting school freight there. The wharf on the reserve is approximately five minutes by launch from the Tofino wharf. There is a freight shed on the government wharf at Tofino that could house the goods going to Christie School, and same could be taken over with the existing equipment that the school has, by launch, in daylight, and transported from the wharf on the reserve to Christie School.\n\nThe rough sketch enclosed will serve to illustrate the surrounding district, and the relative distances, although it is not drawn to scale.\n\nOne other fact to be borne in mind is that once this trail was widened to a sufficient width to allow a truck to pass over it, the upkeep would be very small and all people engaged in the shipping business on the West Coast unanimously agree that it would be impossible, on the other hand, to hold a pile dock in front of the school, thereby proving the contention that it is impossible to build and maintain such a dock without an enormous expenditure. The writer feels that the present suggestion has never been passed to the Department for consideration, and forwards same respectfully, in no way wishing to cloud other plans that are at present under consideration, but feeling that the Department should know conditions as they exist at Christie School and the surrounding district.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. P. Nightingale,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 8, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has recently received another request from the Principal of the Christie Indian Residential School for the erection of a wharf. Enclosed, for your information, is a copy of our reply.\n\nI have to request that you will visit the Christie School, at the earliest possible date, and discuss with the Principal the feasibility of carrying out the suggestion made in the fourth paragraph of our letter of the 7th instant. In the event of our suggestion being practical, the Principal and yourself should obtain estimates of the cost of erecting a warehouse at Tofino and the purchase of a suitable flat-bottomed scow. Following your visit to the school, you should at once report to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nPhilip B.

General,\nDeptl of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFor forty years the Fathers, Sisters, Teaching Staff, the Children, and all callers at Christie Indian Residential School have been inconvenienced, and in many cases their lives have been endangered, in an effort to make a landing on the shores at Kakawis.\n\nThe dangerous and stupendous task of handling freight at this school can only be appreciated by those who have had to do this throughout all these years. But I hardly deem it necessary to make mention of this for the Department has long ago been cognizant of these facts. I am positive that to their way of thinking, as surely as it is ours, a wharf at this institution has been a long-felt need.\n\nI regret to say that almost every principal who has been in charge here, has, with the greatest reluctance, been compelled to give up efforts to secure financial assistance from the Canadian Government, for this, so worthy and so necessary a cause.\n\nI was an assistant to Fr. Charles Moser seventeen years ago, and I felt at that time, as I do now, that if I were placed in charge, a wharf would be the one big thing for which I would strive. I deem it absolutely cruel to compel intelligent men and women to submit to the crude and primitive manner of making landings at this Institution.\n\nAs Religious, we have been, and still are, willing to give all that we have, sacrifice our homes and friends and the comforts of life that we might bring the light of Christianity and the boon of Civilization to these poor unfortunate Indians. All this, to the end that they might some day learn to live cleaner and better lives and become useful and self-sustaining citizens of this Great Country.\nDear Sir:\n\nStrong representations are being made to this Branch that funds be provided for the construction of a wharf, landing platform, and a road from the wharf to the Christie Indian Residential School at Kakwa, West Coast Vancouver Island, B.C.\n\nA request is being made that a grant of $9,000.00 be made available towards the cost of the above mentioned work which would be similar to that at Ahousat with modifications to suit local conditions.\n\nWould you please investigate the matter and furnish me with a report giving your views on this question.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nD. H. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVICTORIA, B.C.\nWith reference to the letter of July 6th from the Principal of the Christie School, also letter written to Commissioner MacKay, before any further consideration is given for construction for wharf at Christie School, contents of the letter on this file should be carefully studied.\n\nIn view of the situation of the school, it would require a very large expenditure to erect a wharf that would withstand the ocean.\n\nA wharf built at a small expense would only be a waste of money.\n\nParticular attention is directed to official letter of November 7, 1935, addressed to Father McLaughlin, who was then a Principal of the Christie School, also to Acting Indian Agent Nightingale's letter of November 15/35 and official reply of December 5, 1935.\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of 23rd August, 1937, in connection with request for a wharf to be constructed at Eakesis, for the Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nThis matter has been brought forward on several other occasions, and rejected by the Department on the grounds that the conditions are unfavourable. Several reports have been made on the possibilities of erecting and maintaining a wharf at which steamships would be willing to land, and all have been unfavourable.\n\nIt is possible to clear a roadway from Opitkot Reserve to the school at much less cost and with greater possibilities, as there is a wall already which would need to be cleaned and planked over, making the roadway suitable for wheeled traffic, with favour by the Department. No thorough survey or estimate of cost has been made of this proposed road, as the retiring Principal considered that he could manage without it.\n\nThe wharf recently erected at Ahousaht could not be compared favourably with the one proposed at Eakesis, as the wharf at Ahousaht is in shallow water, whereas a wharf at Eakesis would be exposed to winter gales, and no matter how placed would be a source of danger to any large ship attempting to get lines ashore. C.P.R. Captains have expressed their opinion that they could not undertake to make a landing there with safety either to ship or wharf.\n\nI enclose file of letters on this subject for your further information, and shall be pleased to make any further report you may wish.

(RG 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 6)\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of August 15th regarding representations made to the Department for the construction of a wharf, landing platform and a road from the wharf to Christie Indian Residential School at Kakawis, West Coast Agency. This matter was referred to Indian Agent Ashbridge and I am forwarding herewith his report dated September 16th for your information.\n\nThe main objection to constructing a wharf at Kakawis is that the site on which it is proposed to construct the wharf is too exposed to the weather and there does not appear to be a suitable site in the vicinity that is not so exposed. There was an examination of this site in 1932 by the senior assistant engineer of the Department of Public Works, who considered the general conditions unfavorable for the construction of a wharf; these conditions still exist and, I consider it would be unwise to proceed with such an undertaking in view of the reports of those who have made an examination of the conditions on the ground and were qualified to do so.\n\nFrom the information before me, it would appear that the construction of a road from Opitsaht Reserve, where there is a wharf, to Christie School would meet the situation. This wharf is in sheltered water, is used by the Indians of the Opitsaht Band and is connected by trail to Christie School. It has been suggested that the proposed road follow closely the location of this trail and that it be wide wide enough to admit of the use of a light truck. The supplies for the school would continue to be landed at Torino and transported by the school launch to the Opitsaht wharf and thence by truck to the school. I am inclined to favor these alternative arrangements and would recommend that an engineer of the Dominion Water and Power Branch be instructed to make a survey of the proposed road and submit a report and an estimate of the cost.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

It is noted that there is a trail which would need to be widened and planked.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, it is not possible to favourably consider incurring the expenditures that would be necessary to send an engineer to make a survey of the proposed road. It is felt that the Indian Agent, or yourself, should be able to let us know the approximate cost of the necessary work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hagg\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nD.W.

They reported that the approximate cost of a new wharf would be $30,000, and, owing to the exposed position in which the wharf would have to be placed, the engineers stated that they considered the somewhat limited advantages obtainable by building a wharf in front of the school, would not be worth the initial and future maintenance costs which would be involved.\n\nRecently a letter was received from Indian Commissioner MacKay in which he suggested that it might be possible to improve the road from the Christie Residential School to a small wharf situated on the Opitsaht Reserve. This wharf is in sheltered water, but will also require some repairs. Indian Commissioner MacKay was written on October 7th and requested to report definitely regarding the condition of the present wharf on the Opitsaht Reserve and also to give an estimate of the cost of placing this wharf in serviceable condition and the cost of clearing the roadway from the Opitsaht Reserve to the Christie School.\n\nAs soon as his reply is received, you will be further advised.\n\nDirector.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, October 25, 1937.\n\nREVEREND:\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\n\nIn response to Fr. Bethune's request, I am attaching hereto two copies of a report relating to the construction of a wharf at the Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nThis report was prepared by the senior assistant engineer, Department of Public Works.\n\nReverend Father Hildebrand, Principal of the Christie School, is at present at Ottawa, and he has informed the officials that a satisfactory wharf can be constructed at the school at an approximate cost of $5,000.00. It would appear that the matter has recently been investigated by an engineer and that Father Hildebrand's estimate is based on information he has received from this official.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of October 4th, 1937, with respect to the wharf at Opitsat Reserve, and to report the findings of my inspection of this wharf, and roadway leading to Christie School, on my last visit there on October 14th.\n\n**Wharf:** Built by the Department with Indian labor, March, 1937. Not yet completed, requires an extra vent to bring out to deep water. Estimated cost to complete $300. The channel is narrow and shallow and only boats with shallow draft can land at wharf.\n\n**Roadway to School:** This trail follows near the beach from Opitsat Reserve to Christie School, and is roughly about 1 1/3 miles in length. For 2 thirds of the way a good trail could be made, but nearing the school there are two bad places where extensive bridging would have to be done in order to make a suitable road for a truck. The whole distance is fairly heavily timbered.\n\nBefore attempting to put in a roadway, it would be advisable to have a surveyor report on it, as it may be possible to find a better grade. The expense of building a roadway suitable for a truck over the present trail would be very heavy, owing to the necessity of bridging and planking.\n\nBefore attempting to place a wharf near the school, or build a roadway from Opitsat I would respectfully recommend that the whole be most thoroughly surveyed, as in either case the expense would be great. The fact of the school being old, leaving a possibility of its having to be rebuilt, should also be considered, as in this event it would not be advisable to put another school on such an inaccessible site.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"P.B.Ashbridge\"\nIndian Agent.\n\nD.M.Mackay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.

Box 8,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, November 13, 1937.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of October 30th enclosing copy of a report received from Indian Agent Ashbridge in connection with the proposed wharf at Christie Indian Residential School.\n\nSince writing you on October 7, the Reverend Principal of the Christie School visited the Department. He stated that an engineer of the Public Works Department had recently visited the Christie School and had recommended a different site for a wharf from that mentioned in our letter of October 7 and Mr. Ashbridge's reply of October 27.\n\nI have not yet received a copy of the report of the engineer in connection with his recent survey, but we have written the Public Works Department requesting same. If you know anything about this recent survey, I would appreciate your advising me on receipt of this letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Nosy\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 5,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your 159-0-5 of the 7th instant, I beg to submit herewith a copy of a report from Indian Agent Ashbridge, received in reply to a request to supply the information desired.\n\nAlthough Mr. Ashbridge is familiar with the area and looked over the location of the trail at present in use, he apparently finds himself unable to give an estimate of the cost of a road which would admit of the use of a light truck, and recommends the services of a surveyor to determine the location and estimate of the cost.\n\nIn connection with this proposed road, it may be of interest to the Department to know that the immediate predecessor of the present Principal of Christie Residential School did not press for this road as he considered he could manage without it.\n\nThe extension to the wharf at an estimated cost of $300.00 is recommended for favourable consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

During the last 20 years various requests have come to the Department from this school for a wharf and three different sites have been surveyed, but owing to one reason or another, principally as being unsuitable owing to prevailing winds and adverse currents for the steamer landings, the wharf was not built. Having this in mind I made a point of showing the plan of the bay with a drawing of the wharf to Captain Robert Thomson of the \"PRINCESS NORAH\", and asked his opinion in regard to making a landing here should a wharf be constructed. Both from an examination of the plan and observations made since when in the vicinity of the bay, Captain Thomson reports favourably on the site that a landing could be made here by the C.P.R. Coastal Steamers unless under very abnormal weather conditions.\n\nThere is no public road here and a private road would have to be made through heavily wooded land for a distance of about one-half mile to connect the school with the wharf by land.\n\nThe school has been a port of call for the C.P.R. Coastal Steamers for many years, making three calls each month.

As requested, I enclose two copies of the Deputy Minister's letter, also two copies of the Engineer's report.\n\nThe necessity for the erection of a wharf for the Christie School has been brought to the Department's attention on several occasions during past years. There is no doubt that a wharf is required. However, when preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1936-37, we did not have definite information regarding the cost of the erection of a wharf at this point and, consequently, no funds were provided for the purpose. If it were possible to provide $5,000 in the supplementary estimates, I would consider that such action would be advisable.\n\nDirector.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\n6th December, 1937.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nRe - Construction of wharf in front of Christie Indian School at Kakawis, B.C.\n\nI note from your memorandum of the 2nd instant that you apparently have in mind the possibility of including in the Supplementary Estimates for Indian Affairs an item of $9,000.00 to cover the construction of this wharf. Should not the provision of money for work of this kind be looked after by the Department of Public Works?\n\nCan you give me a rough idea of the number of passengers and the amount of freight coming to this school at each call, or throughout the year? Would the wharf serve the school only or is there a settlement at this point that would benefit through the construction of a wharf?\n\nWe should have all available information with regard to the need for the wharf in case it is decided to take the matter up with the Public Works Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Minister:\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Jackson's memorandum of December 6 in connection with the request for the construction of a wharf in front of the Indian Residential School at Kakawis, B.C.\n\nWhile the wharf might be used by some of the Indians residing in the locality, it would be almost totally required by the management of the Christie Residential School. As a consequence, if the wharf were built, the expense would have to be assumed by this Department, as I consider it unlikely that the Public Works Department would construct it. However, there can be no possible objection to endeavouring to have them do so.\n\nAt the Christie School there are 110 pupils and a staff of 14. All food, clothing, and other requirements of the school have to be brought in by boat, as there are no local stores. It is located on the west coast of Vancouver Island on a site exposed to the Pacific Ocean. During many years past, successive Principals have directed our attention to the fact that weather conditions make the handling of freight both a dangerous and stupendous task. There is no doubt that a wharf is extremely necessary for this school.\n\nDirector\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6440, file 879-5, part 6)\nMEMORANDUM:\nFrom: A.Halkett, Asst.

My answer invariably was that we were asked to wait until April when the matter would be taken up and decided upon.\n\nWhen I personally interviewed the Department I had two very important requests to make. The one referred to a wharf and the other to a building for Manual Training. You have letters on file in reference to these projects. I was told that it might be impossible to grant both of them at the same time.\n\nIf I were to choose between the two I would be at a loss to consider which the more important. For our boys to learn how to repair engines, make boats and bridges and build their simple dwellings is a very important feature in their educational development and in their future self-maintenance.\n\nCould I suggest that the Government reimburse us next year if we, at this time, construct the building in lieu of the fact that you would set aside, at once, the money necessary for a wharf? A Manual Training shop is a direct benefit to the boys, a wharf an absolute necessity for the entire school and an asset to all who have any interests at Kakawis.\n\nI notice that the Government has already consented to invest twice the amount we ask for a similar project at Zeballos, B.C. This project is but an infant and might petrify before it has two legs to stand on, and yet men will urge the Government to invest thousands of dollars, and they themselves are willing to throw in all they have, and cast the die for the possible gain of a few paltry dollars. Let us at\nleast compare the development of character in the natives and the utility of the projects necessary for this, to that of a purely commercial idea. In the long run, remuneration for this will be ample.\n\nSo, dear sirs, again we plead with you not to turn a deaf ear to our needs, but grant us, under the exercise of your good and far-sighted discretion, these two most urgent requests.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd.) Hildebrand Melchior\n\nRev. Hildebrand Melchior, O.S.B.\nPrincipal.\n\nN.B. I know definitely that, for various reasons, Mr. P. B. Ashbridge is not in favor of a wharf.

Regarding this project I may say that the Dominion Government has contributed certain funds to the several provinces to assist in the improvement of transportation in the mining districts. These projects are ones which are recommended by the Provinces and the work is carried out entirely under provincial supervision. The Zeballos wharf being one of the provincial projects is not in the same category as the wharf you have proposed for Kakawis.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Minister.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM P. B. ASHBIDGE, Indian Agent,\nWest Coast Agency, Port Alberni, B. C., dated June 30, 1938.\n\nI have the honour to submit the regular agency letter covering conditions within this agency during the month ending June 30th, 1938.\n\nCHRISTIE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL:\n\nThe school authorities are putting in a float landing and building a trail, to improve facilities for landing people and supplies. While some doubt exists as to the life of the float during the winter storms, the efforts of the principal and staff are commendable, and reflect great credit on those who have assisted with the work.\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawin, B.C.\nSept. 6th, 1938\n\nMr. Philip Paclan,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Paclan:\n\nIn the estimates made by Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge and myself, we made out a few days ago some track about which I think it advisable to write to you. This track, if obtained, is to be laid between the School and the present float which is located where the projected wharf may be built. The main objection which may be raised against supplying this track is that the wharf may never be built as it has not been definitely proved that a wharf can be constructed at this or any other point. The reply is that even if a wharf is never built, the track is really necessary\u2014necessary in the sense that it will eliminate a great deal of hard work and danger.\n\nAs you are aware, passengers and freight are now taken from the C.P.R. steamer, several hundred yards from shore, put into one of our boats, brought nearer to the shore and then passengers as well as freight are carried on the boat's bank to the beach. The freight has to be carried a considerable distance to a truck which hauls it up in a hill to its destination. Transferring from the steamer to our boat and carrying from our boat through the water to the shore are dangerous and difficult operations if the sea is at all rough. Considerable loss is incurred for instance when flour has thus to be transported in the rain. Other merchandise has been dropped and lost or damaged in the sea. One Venerable Mother Provincial fell in far from shore and was only just rescued. I need not describe what is likely to happen in a storm. Should the rails not be granted, the Will the right put it into my mind to suggest to one of the men that, when the next Official from Ottawa comes, there be an unavoidable accident whereby the said visitor be able to compare his experiences with those of the Mother Provincial.\n\nFather Hildebrand believed, as did others, that a wharf might be constructed at a certain point and, to see whether this were feasible or not, had a float built at this point. It is argued that, if this float stands up against the winter tides and storms, a much more strongly built wharf will do the same. Let us suppose that no wharf can be built. Well, the float or a landing place will be of great use to us. Passengers and freight can be brought from the steamer to this place without the long planks back ride through the water. The freight can be transferred from the boat to the truck, awaiting at the landing, and hauled by motor over the rails to the School. This truck could be covered to protect flour, etc., against the rain. A great deal of hard and dangerous work would thus be eliminated. I might add that, as there is no place for walks, the children are often taken for a ride Sunday afternoon on the school boat. We have already found the float a great advantage in loading and unloading the children.\n\nA good start has already been made on the trail. A clearing, about 10-12 feet wide, has been cut through the woods from the School to the float and all stumps have been removed. We still have a good deal of levelling and grading to do. The weather and the fact that all has to be done by hand (we have no tractor, horse, ploughs or scrapers) make this slow work but we are going ahead.\n\nIn order to stand a better chance of getting the rails, we have not put several other items into the estimates. Something should be done; I helped unload 6 tons of freight the other day, and can imagine what the landing of 30 tons of coal means.\n\nI felt that these things should be brought to your attention so that you would understand why we asked for rails even though it is not certain that a real wharf can be built.\nChristie Indian Residential School\n\nKakawis, B.C.\n\nCan a wharf be built\u2014one that will stand up? I do not know. The man who built the float and who has built several wharves in the neighbourhood believes that a satisfactory wharf can be built. I do not know enough about these matters or about the storms and tides here to say.\n\nShortly before I left the Cariboo School, you kindly sent us some footballs and volley balls. I felt like writing to you but felt that that might be rather impolite. The covers were not very good and the bladders were evidently old stock with small holes in them. You will have to watch the suppliers next time!\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. F.\n\nP.S. Father Turner, who was here at the time, tells me that a Road Engineer approved of the location chosen and said that the Engineer said that a satisfactory wharf could be built there.\n\nHaving been informed that $2500 has been appropriated for a Manual Training Shop (carpentry) (proposed for a Manual Training Shop (carpentry) (machine shop)) I have made a sketch of building plans forwarded to a competent carpenter for his comment\u2014G. F.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nSeptember 15, 1938.\n\nDear Father Forbes:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 6th instant in which you state that in your estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40 you are requesting the Department to supply some track to be laid between the school and the present float. I hope that either the Indian Agent or yourself is supplying an estimate of the cost of this track. I can assure you that your request in this regard will be given careful consideration when the estimates are being prepared. As you mention in your letter the question of building a wharf at the Christie School has been considered by the Department on several occasions during the past few years. The estimates received, however, indicated that an expenditure of upwards of $9000.00 would be necessary and even with this expenditure there was some doubt as to whether a wharf could be constructed that would withstand the elements.\n\nI note that you intend to write us later regarding the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for a new manual training building. In that event full details should be given regarding the materials that you request as purchases are now made through our Purchasing Branch. This information should reach us as soon as possible.\n\nI hope that you are finding conditions at Christie School reasonably satisfactory. It must be quite a change for you from the Cariboo School but I suppose in a short time you will be a real authority on boats, ocean tides and any other difficulties that you have to contend with at Christie.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. G. Forbes, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Residential School,\nKakawin, B. C.\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawis, B.C. June 7th, 1940\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nMay I speak to you frankly? I think that your having Indians from various provinces broadcast to all Canadians was a master stroke. The enclosed photograph will indicate they are doing our bit. I come from a family of actors and I thought that good plays might help our pupils to speak good English and to talk distinctly. Competent critics (your Inspector of Schools included) show that my effort was not in vain. And, moreover, take a look at these boys (our presentation of Cardinal Wiseman's 2\u00bd hours \"Hidden Gun\"), have I fed them well? Are they happy?\n\nI have done my share and I ask you to do the same. Will you please have your Department use their imagination in lieu of their knowledge? I would welcome an official of the Department here. The facts: I was in charge of the Cariboo School for over 7 years. In officially, I was at the Kamloops and other schools... The point is this: Kamloops Mission, Cariboo, Lytton, Sardis, etc., have their large pupilage and their farms. We have a small pupilage here and RISK with no possible farm or herd. We have not only to buy what those schools produce but we have to pay freight on it. I could add more but think that this will suggest that we deserve special treatment may I add this? The C.P.R. boat stops away out. Our motor boat meets it and proceeds to low water. Canoes then take off passengers and freight. The canoes stop and our men and I pack passengers and freight through the water on our backs. If you, the Pope or the King come, the procedure will be the same. We DESERVE consideration. So, if a cut must come, do not make a general cut but use your knowledge or imagination. If they have been too frank, well I am from Calgary and crave your indulgence.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Rhoda Webster & Kakawis School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter re the recent protest made by me to the admission of the above girl to the Kakawis School, and also copy of your letter to Rev. B. McLaughlin of that school.\n\nI note that you ask Father McLaughlin to \"consult\" with me re the case and let you know the conclusions we both arrive at.\n\nFather McLaughlin 'phoned me today, but his conversation was far from being in the nature of a consultation. I pointed out to him that Webster was Protestant, was baptized into the United Church membership, was educated at this school and that his brother was at present a member of this school, also that Webster had recently voluntarily asked me to baptize his youngest child. Father McLaughlin stated that Webster was a Catholic, that his father was a Catholic and that all the Indians on the Coast including the Ahousaht Band were Catholics. I asked him to repeat this statement, which he did. I then said that, in his opinion, this school had absolutely no right of existence, and was not entitled to any Indian pupils whatever. He said that that was true, and this statement he also repeated.\n\nUnder the circumstances, and in face of the emphatically expressed opinion of the Father that this school has no right of existence on the Coast, you can conceive how impossible it is for us to come to any amicable agreement. I feel that this matter of pupilage is one that can only be definitely settled by an authoritative pronouncement by the Department of Indian Affairs. I have no wish to attempt to enter into any further negotiations with the Kakawis school as it is obviously considered by them that this school is entitled to no rights and privileges whatever.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

He was also baptized, 7th September, 1913, in the Catholic Church, copy of entry in register attached.\n\nIt will be noted, from a perusal of the attached correspondence, that there is considerable feeling in the matter as between the Principals of both schools. This I have endeavored to overcome, but have been unable to get them to see eye to eye in the matter. I would therefore request, please, that a definite ruling be given by the Department in the matter, which I feel sure will be agreeable to all concerned.\n\nAn interview with the father, as to his religion, and wishes in this matter is very unsatisfactory, being a man of weak intellect, and under the domination of his wife.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

As a result of these enquiries, I find that Peter Webster was first baptized Catholic, and he states that he changed his religion in 1920 and was a pupil of the Ahousaht Residential School until December 1925. He also informed me that his present faith is Protestant, and that of his wife Catholic, and that while he wishes all of his children to be entered at the United Church School, he hesitates due to his wife's wishes. Her wish is that at least one of the children be entered at the Catholic School.\n\nWhile this would appear reasonable, it is pointed out by Mr. Caldwell and the Reverend Principal of Christie School that this would not be in the best interests of the children. Webster stated definitely before me that his wish was that the children be sent to Ahousaht School, and that in the event of the Department so ruling his wife would be satisfied with that decision.\n\nI enclose letters from both school Principals in connection with this matter, and would say that both gentlemen stated that the Department's decision would be satisfactory to them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nPSA/AM.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawis, B.C.\n(WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND)\n\nAugust 20, 1937\n\nDr. P.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Dr. Ashbridge:\n\nThis letter is in reference to your communication of March 8th, No. 1653 relative to Rhoda Webster.\n\nAccording to the communication of that date there was to be some definite decision made in regard to the attendance of this child at school. This decision was to be reached during the month of July.\n\nSince I have not heard from you I was wondering if the Department had made some ruling. The parents of Rhoda Webster are very anxious that their daughter be returned to school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHildebrand Melchior.\n\n(Rev. Hildebrand Melchior, O.S.B.)\nPrincipal\nIndian Residential School\nAhousaht, B.C.\nAugust 14th 1937.\n\nMr. P.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nRe Rhoda Webster.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn the matter of the admittance of the above child to residential school attendance, decision was deferred by the Department until July of this year.\n\nMay I request that the Department again be made cognizant of the facts in connection with this case.\n\nPeter Webster, the father, under the name of Peter Samson, was admitted to the Ahousaht school at the age of 13, on Jan 19th 1920, not having previously attended any other school. His brother, Andrew Webster, was admitted to this school on July 2nd 1929. He is still attending the school at the age of 15.\n\nPeter Webster, or Samson, was discharged from this school on Dec. 31st 1922.\n\nPeter Webster is a Protestant. His present wife is Catholic. There are three children of the marriage to date, and the decision in this case will affect the other children.\n\nWebster signified his intention to apply for admission of the girl Rhoda to the Ahousaht school last year, and it was only the violent protest of his wife, to which protest the writer was witness, that induced the father to make application for Rhoda's admission to the Christie School.\n\nThat Peter Webster has not changed his religion is indicated by the fact that he personally requested the baptism of his latest child, Jessie, into the Protestant faith, and the baptism was performed November 8th 1936.\n\nFormer decisions of disputes of this nature by the Department have been against this school, attention being called to the provisions of the Indian Act as stated by Sec. IO (2).\n\nMay I submit that the facts of the above case designate the above child a Protestant child within the meaning of the Indian Act.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMay I add that the father Peter Webster has stated to me that it is the intention of his wife to send the female children to the Christie School and the male children to the Ahousaht School. I am sure that the Department will decide that this is a practice that should not be encouraged, in the interests of Indian family unity.\nOttawa, August 7, 1937\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, the Department approves the admission of Thomas Lucas to the Christie Residential School.\n\nIn view of the medical officer's report, we are not prepared to approve the admission of these other two, namely, Isabell Francis and Lena Francis. If these children are at present at the School, they should be returned to their parents at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nP. B.

These children have been brought to us by their guardians without our having sought them. We have even been reluctant to admit them owing to the extra care and attention that has to be given to young children. In these cases, either the father, mother or both are dead. Sometimes the father and mother are living apart and often the children are in the care of the old grandparents who can ill afford to care for them.\n\nSuch are the cases under consideration and we have been moved by charity to admit them to our school in the hope that you will place them on the per capita grant in view of the extra care and attention that has to be given. We have noticed your have granted this request before.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nHildebrand Melchior\nRev. Hildebrand Melchior, O.S.B.\nPrincipal\n\nP.S.\n\nI should have made some mention also, relative to the discharge age limit of children. Some say the age is sixteen, other eighteen. The Sisters and the faculty are all agreed that sixteen would be a reasonable age at which to discharge boys. We are making an earnest request, however, that girls be retained at the school until they are eighteen. There are very serious reasons for this, namely, that as soon as a girl leaves school at any age she becomes the prey of men seeking her in marriage, and anyone knows that the life of these children is difficult enough after wedding in maturity. Please grant us the permission to retain all girls until they have attained their eighteenth year.\n\nH.M.\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawis, B.C.\n(WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND)\n\nJune 26, 1937\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nOf Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis letter concerns a boy by the name of Timothy Paul who finished at our school last term, and whose name has been sent into the department and accepted for dismissal.\n\nThis young man has been with us during the entire vacation and has asked us if he could still remain at the school. He wishes to continue his education and it may be possible that we could give him some help towards this end. This boy is of exceptionally good character and for that reason also we should like to keep him at the school for his good influence on the other children.\n\nWould you consider replacing him on the per capita grant?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nHildebrand Melchior\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6441, file 879-10, part 5)\nPort Alberni B.C.\nAug 30 - 1937\nTo Indian Department Ottawa\nDear Sir,\n\nI was born on American side my farther was first Indian Agent on American Indian reservation, my mother was B.C. Indian woman, when seven years old. I was sent to Spanish school six miles from Victoria. Have been here ever since.\n\n30 years ago I took Indian wife, first born was a girl, second a boy, who at 3 years died away. Sometimes, got mixing around with American Indians, when we were visiting or friends on American side, a boy was born to her, she died six weeks after her baby was born. I have taken care of the boy ever since his was born. Left my wife 3 years ago, she was jealous of every woman I happen to look at she pleaded to let her have the boy for a while, she promised that she would not send him to school as he is not healthy on account that when only two years old a heavy stick struck him on the side of his head it almost killed him, he has no memory as he had bad blood in his brain.\nand Doctor's advice was not to send him to school. This summer while I was at Kyquet fishing, she sent the boy to school at Claguet Indian School. Now that boy's name was born on American side, and also his father was American Indian. He has inherited from his parents a property, and although his name is not yet on the papers, he receives money from timber on his property. His father died 5 or 6 years ago. The boy is now 12 years old, and Dan is his guardian. Dan is a white man, raised among white people, who went to white school, and all Agents always said that I was a white man that my grand son was white and any white and Indian Agent said Indian Department had nothing to do with us. None of the Indians would ever give my grand son or my wife any medicine when sick, and why do they now want to keep that boy in that Indian school among these Indians boys, who are some of them rotten with discipline and only 3 cents for all the boys.\nIt seems that we are not white any more. The C. priest and Indian Agent seem to be forced to have that boy in school. The C. priest would not even let me see the boy or let him come on my boat, and I love that boy as my own as I got no children, and I am going to adopt him. I will never forget how that C. priest treated me. He treated me as if I was a wild animal. I was even ordered to pull my anchor up and leave in front of the school. Now I have been ordered to have the boy on American side to sign in on his property not later than May 1938, and how am I going to take an American side if C. priest is doing his best at Lagrange Indian school? I think you see that C. priest is wrong in keeping that boy there. He can not be Canadian and cannot hold his land on American side and the poor boy will land that land he becomes a man of no status on this side he will have nothing enclosed you will find last payment on his timber please returned. The boy's name Bertrand Webster, his grand mother's name Jennie Willie unlettered Indian woman.\nI belong to Church of England and can see my feelings to see my grand son in that private school. Hope you will understand that it will be the boys advantage to be an American Indian as he will be sure to get more property from his uncles and grandparents on American side. Hope to hear from you soon.\n\nYours Very Respectfully,\nChas B. Webster\nPort Alberni\n\nB.F.\nOTTAWA, September 22, 1937.\n\nReverend Sirs\u2014\n\nA request has been received from Charles B.

MacLeod, also copies of correspondence which he forwarded with his letter. You will note that C.B. Webster wishes his grandson discharged from the Christie Residential School.\n\nOn checking the June return of the Christie School, there is no boy shown as Bertrand Webster, but there is a boy named Bertrand Williams-No. 248. Possibly this is the same boy.\n\nIf Bertrand Webster is in the Christie School, you should state whether or not his father is alive and what right the grandfather apparently has to demand his discharge from the school.\n\nYou should also consult the Principal of the Christie School with regard to this boy and ascertain whether or not he has any objection to the discharge being granted. The Principal is being advised that you will speak to him about this boy in order that he may have all information available for you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nP.J.

Being the wife of Charlie Webster, who is not an Indian, the Department does not consider itself responsible to carry on business for you the same as they would for regular Indians, and what I have done already has been done out of kindness to you and, as I have said before, if you are not satisfied the best thing for you to do is to carry on any further business with the Company yourself.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) W.R.

Because of Indian Agent Mr. C. Priest over stepping the bounds of the law because they think they can do it, to aggravate me, I wrote him that hard letter and told truthly.\ncircumstance of the case.

Webster\nBainfield\nO.C.\nIndian Residential School\nAhousaht, B.C.\n\nNovember 25th 1937.\n\nMr. P.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPORT ALBERNI, B.C. Re Rhoda Webster.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMay I enquire as to what decision has been made by the Department in the matter of the above child. She is residing in the Ahousaht Village and will be eight years old on April 13th next.\n\nIn view of the fact that the father, Peter Webster, has declared himself before you as being Protestant, and that, while it is his wife's desire that the children should be entered in a Catholic school, it is the father's own desire that they should be educated in a Protestant school, I cannot see where there should be any great difficulty in determining the case.\n\nThere are increasing number of marriages between Catholics and Protestants on the Coast, and in every case where a male Protestant has married a female Catholic, a promise has been extracted from the wife that the children shall be sent to a Catholic school. I have made no attempt to confuse the situation as designated by Section 10 of the Indian Act, and I have refused application for entrance of children to this school where the father of the applicant has been Catholic, but it is obviously important to the continuance of Protestant pupilage on the West Coast, that a definite decision should be made in a case, such as the one now in question, where the father is definitely Protestant.\n\nI should be glad to have this matter cleared up.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to refer to my letter of August 28th, 1937, reference to Rhoda Webster, and to enclose herewith letter received from Mr. A. E. Caldwell, requesting a decision in this matter of her admission to school.\n\nI would respectfully request the Department's ruling in this matter to enable me to reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. B.

W. Thomas Wholesale Jeweler. Due to Mr. John's inability in the past to cooperate with his employers for any length of time, it was felt that the children should be sent to the Christie Indian Reservation School in spite of the change in the financial situation.\n\nHowever, Mr. D. W. Thomas came to our office with Mr. John and personally guaranteed that he would pay rent for the family and also give Mr. John a salary of $20.00 per week for a period of a year. Since the entire business is a seasonal one and it is quite possible that the company may not be able to continue business after June or Mr. John may not be able to produce the necessary work, we do not feel entirely satisfied regarding Mr. John's future independence.\n\nIn view of the above, do you feel that we are justified in allowing the children to remain with their parents? If so, would it be possible to return them to the Reservation later, in case the family had to again seek assistance from the King County Welfare Department?\n\nWould you please notify us regarding this, and upon receipt of your reply, we will return the draft at once.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nKENNETH H.

C.\n\nDear Mr. Ashbridge:\n\nRecently I employed Willie Johns on a yearly basis to carve for me and just a few days ago I learned that the welfare department of this city had been negotiating with you and that all arrangements had been made to return the five older children to be put in school on Vancouver Island. This action was of course the result of the families need for welfare assistance and to the rather deplorable conditions under which they were living. Without knowing anything about all this my immediate thought was to move the family into better quarters. This I have done. The children are in school getting along nicely and I can guarantee that the father's employment will be steady. Under these circumstances the welfare department said they would recommend to you that we keep the family together. Mr. Johns is teaching his boys the art of carving and they are making splendid progress. They are of course not working for me but merely practicing at home and are also getting considerable help in designing and coloring at school. Of course no one can tell what the future holds and my only concern is that should all these bright prospects fall through that there will be in such an event the same opportunity for the children to be put in your school up there. My opinion is that the only thing that would bring such a situation would be the death or incapacity of the father. I should be glad to hear from you in regard to the above.\n\nI am very much interested in developing Indian art craft and I am told that the very best baskets in the Northwest are made by your Vancouver Island Indians. Any information that you may be able to give me regarding sources will be very much appreciated.\n\nI have often thought of making a trip up the west coast of Vancouver Island and hope to be able to do so this coming summer in which case I shall make it a point to call on you.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He is living with the entire family in the same shack which he had in 1936. The children have all been ill from a diet of fish heads, and one of the boys was in King County Hospital for a short time. The eight members of the family are sleeping in two small bunks.\n\nMr. John stated that a change had been made on the reservation which prevented the family from remaining. It was impossible to determine just what he meant, although he mentioned something about land being sold.\n\nThe four boys have been enrolled in a public grade school where they are all in the Adjustment Class.\n\nWould it be possible for the family to return to Port Alberni? There seems to be no means by which Mr. John can support his family, here. They are living in almost unbelievable squalor, and it seems that the children at least should be removed.\n\nPlease inform us whether the family may be returned to the reservation, and if so are you able to meet the expense of transportation.\n\nYours very truly,\nKING COUNTY WELFARE DEPT.\nKENNETH WADLEIGH, Adminr.\n\nMiss Pearl E.

At that time you should write the Department, giving full particulars regarding the religion her father is recognised as professing at that time.

At that time it is presumed she will be sent home for holidays and she should not return to the Christie School unless in the meantime official approval has been given for her admission.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

I told Mr. Webster to write again to the Department.\n\nI feel positive that you would make no mistake in deciding that this child should be sent to Christie School at once. I would like to have her here for at least a month before School lets out so that, under special care, she might make up for much of the time she has already lost.

Jimmy John has again kept his children at Seattle and refuses to send them back, having obtained work there and presumably a home for his family, being assisted in this by Mr. Dell W. Thomas, whose letter I attach.\n\nThe Welfare Department of Seattle has given me every assistance in this matter, but apparently Jimmy John is evading them, although he periodically applies to them for assistance.\n\nIn view of this, I would respectfully request information and advice as to the status of this man, and the advisability of returning the children to Canada.\n\nI feel I should advise the Department that the prospects of gainful employment for Jimmy John in Canada are negligible and he and his family, if re-admitted, would automatically become a charge against the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP.

He believed that, as the boy is not strong and is made to work too hard at home, his being discharged might mean another sick Indian for whom relief and medical care will be needed. He told me that the boy's health is quite good so long as he remains in school. Another reason that Father H. gave is that the boy is very trustworthy, sets an excellent example to the other boys and exerts a good influence over them. The men members of the staff agree with Father H.'s opinion. As we have two older boys, the boy might be of great use to us in case there were a fire.

For some reason he was baptized by the United Church minister and entered at Ahousaht, whereas his parents are both Catholic, and who at this late date now wish to have him transferred.\n\n\"When at Ahousaht recently, I spoke to Mr. Caldwell, the Principal, and he has no objection to this transfer.\n\n\"I would respectfully recommend that this application be approved.\"\n\nIn official letter of December 7, 1938, Indian Agent Ashbridge was informed that the admission of Robert Martin to the Christie residential school was approved.

(RG 10, Volume 6441, file 879-10, part 5)\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is to find out why the Indian boy ROBERT MARTIN of Catholic parents who desire him to attend Kakawis Indian Residential School is by a recent ruling of the department not permitted to go there despite the fact that under the Indian Act he is too young to be discharged from school? There is no question of his being needed by the father as his brother Simon is already at the father's disposal.\n\nPlease note however that this letter is not written in any contentious spirit. I know full well the department is beset with many intricate difficulties that no laws however wise could entirely solve but the various methods of bribing Catholic Indian parents to take out affidavits that their children are not Catholics etc., etc., call for serious attention. This is a case typical of several others and apparently the department simply rules that nothing be done instead of ruling that the child be sent where he should have been sent several years ago. I have all the documents in this case but I am not sending them on immediately because I still desire to spare you any avoidable embarrassment. Is there some hidden factor in this particular case?\n\nWishing you a very happy new year I remain\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n+ John E.

In regard to the application the Agent wrote as follows:\n\n\"With regard to Robert Martin, this boy has been for the past seven years a pupil at Ahousaht School. For some reason he was baptized by the United Church minister and entered at Ahousaht, whereas his parents are both Catholic, and who at this late date now wish to have him transferred.\n\n\"When at Ahousaht recently, I spoke to Mr. Caldwell, the Principal, and he has no objection to this transfer.\n\n\"I would respectfully recommend that this application be approved.\"\n\nIn official letter of December 7, 1938, Indian Agent Ashbridge was informed that the Department approved the admission of Robert Martin to the Christie residential school. In view of the above correspondence the Department was under the impression that the boy had been admitted to the Christie school. I am not exactly certain from the contents of your letter whether or not he is at the school but if he is there is no necessity for any further action as his admission has been officially approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. H. J. Sorensen, O.M.I.,\nChristie Indian Residential School,\nKakawin, B. C.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawin, B.C. February 5th, 1939\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nAs the Catholic missionary in charge of the Indian missions on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, I respectfully request that you reconsider your recent decision in the case of Bob Martin as I believe that, when you gave your decision, you did not have all the facts before you. It is perhaps my fault that you did not have these facts; I did not give you our side of the case because I believed that to be unnecessary after Mr. Indian Agent had examined both sides of the controversy and had sent in a request that the boy be transferred from the Anousant School to the Christie School.\n\nAs will appear from the enclosed excerpts from our Baptismal and Marriage Registers, the boy's parents, Mr. and Mrs. George Martin, were both baptized as children, according to the rites of the Catholic Church, and were married in that Church. They grew up in that church and had their older children baptized in it; they are now both practical Catholics and, as will appear from their letter, which I shall quote, wish their children to be brought up in the Catholic religion and to attend a Catholic School. Some years ago, however, they sent some of their older children to the Anousant School and, I presume, duly declared that they were what they were not\u2014Protestants. When questioned why they, being Catholics, had sent their children to a Protestant School, they replied that, at that time, they were very poor and they could not afford to send their children to the Christie School because that School made the parents pay for the pupils' clothing whereas the Anousant School gave the clothing free of charge. Whatever the reason was, they sent their older children to the Anousant School but, after leaving that place, two of them (Simon and Robert) joined the Catholic Church.\n\nEarly this last fall, two women came and told the Principal of the Christie School that Mrs. Martin would like to have him visit her as she and her husband wished to have Bob transferred. The Principal did not go. Then, the father came and was told that, if he wished to have the boy transferred, he should give his reasons in writing either to the Indian Agent or to me. I very strongly advised me not to do anything to induce or to encourage the parents to send their son to the Christie School. Some time later, the father brought a letter which I quote in full: \"Indian Reserve, Optsamit, Oct 14th, 1938. Rev. Father Forbes, Christie School. Dear Father: We have had another letter from Mr. Caldwell, Principal Anousant School, asking that we send (sic) our boy Robert back to Anousant. I have written a letter to Mr. Ashbridge telling him about Robert and also asking him to put things right with Mr. Caldwell and that I was sending my boy to Christie School. I told him that we want our boy to be a Catholic like we are. I want you to please help us with the matter. I won't have my boy sent to the Anousant School. Yours truly, Mr. and Mrs. Geo. Martin.\"\n\nThe Principal sent the application form and, I believe, a copy of this letter to the Indian Agent. Mr. Caldwell telephoned to the Principal and letters were exchanged\u2014all of them, I understand, out-of-town.\n\nThe Principal of the Christie School did not want the boy here until the Indian Department had approved of his admission and understood the father to say that he would keep him until after Christmas. Then, towards the end of November, the boy arrived, unannounced on the steamer, as his parents were far away, at Barclay Sound, and as he did not want to impose the boy on other Indians, the Principal agreed to keep the boy as a guest until the Department had given a ruling. For several weeks, the boy wore his own clothing and was given only a pair of rubber boots as his own were in bad shape. He was kept as a guest because we could not turn him out.\n\nI fully realize how the Principal of the Anousant School feels after having given\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawis, B.C.\n\nThis boy has education but there are other things to consider. The number of years the boy spent at the Ahousaht School does not right the wrong done in accepting him. I presume that the father declared himself to be a Protestant when he asked to have his son admitted but my Principal knows the value of Indians' assertions in similar circumstances and should assure himself that these declarations are truthful. In the present case this could easily have been done.\n\nThe parents were greatly to blame but they should not now be penalized for wishing to correct their original error. The boy is not needed at home as even his older brother was without work during part of the fall fishing. There are three small children, one of them an infant, at home and the parents are not well-off.\n\nIt has been stated that the boy is tubercular. The Principal here heard of that and had the boy examined with this result: \"Has this child active tuberculosis in your opinion?\"\n\nNov. 26/38\nMr. John Robertson, M.D.\" I might add that, since Bob's arrival here, he has gained weight and looks much better.\n\nWhen this case was discussed some time ago, a friend suggested that, to avoid trouble and unpleasantness, we be satisfied to have this boy go home and, therefore, attend neither school. That would be, besides an injustice to the boy and, in the circumstances, to his parents weakly to compromise.\n\nThere is a principle at stake and it is on account of this principle that I am writing frankly but, in sincerity at least, not discourteously. Neither the Principal here nor myself wish to start a fight with any other school but we do want the children of Catholic parents here. If I had wished to start a fight or to cause you annoyance, I believe that I could, on much firmer grounds, than Mr. Caldwell has in this case, have protested the presence of certain children in the Ahousaht school. I am not, for the present, protesting but am suggesting an instance. Our registers show that the father and the mother and also their child (at about the age of one) were baptized in the Catholic church. The parents are not legally married and therefore, according to a ruling transmitted to this school by a former Indian Agent, the mother should have the custody of the child. She wants her children to be Catholics and wrote a letter asking my predecessor to baptize her latest child. We and I want to baptize the child but we could not do so because the child's father (a baptized Catholic) had promised Mr. Caldwell to let the latter baptize the child. To return to the first child mentioned, that child is in the Ahousaht school.\n\nI mention the above facts to show that we are not going out of our way to cause trouble but, when people like the Martins come to us entirely of their own free will and ask us to take their children into school, I do not see that we have the right to refuse them. I respectfully submit that we should not always be on the losing side. To revert to the case mentioned in the preceding paragraph, I might mention that the father and another man visited the Principal here and, without being spoken to, the father said: \"My child should be here but the Department decided that it should go to the Ahousaht school.\" He would likely say the opposite if he were talking to Mr. Caldwell but, anyway, we lost out in that case although our records show that the child and its parents are baptized Catholics.\n\nI trust that I have not been lacking in courtesy but I wished to be frank and to give my side of the case. I request that you reconsider your decision, in view of the facts given, and that you approve of Robert Martin's transfer from a Protestant School to a Catholic School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(P.S.)

Forbes O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Christie Indian School,\nKakawis, B.C.\n\nReverend and Dear Father:\n\nThe following are the reasons why Chief Edward Joseph of this tribe (Clayoquot) wishes to put his young daughter Marjory (or Margaret) into school although she will not have attained the full age acquired for admittance into school until next fall. At present the Chief and his wife are living in a rather small house which is somewhat crowded. They have four children at home, two little girls younger than Marjory, a boy a few years older who is out of school as being T.B. suspect, and an older son who has been discharged from school. There is also a young lad, an orphan, from Kyuquot, who was discharged from school about a year ago, living with them. I understand from the Doctor that this boy has T.B. of the lungs as well as the wife of Chief Edward. Besides this unhealthful atmosphere of the home the reason given me by the mother was that she had to many little ones to take care of them properly and at the same time keep house for the rest of the family. Under these conditions I believe they have good reason to ask for their child to be admitted into school.\n\nSincerely,\n\n(Rv.) H.J.

However, in view of the fact that the number of children of school age is apparently increasing and the further consideration that due to the conditions now confronting us there is no immediate prospect of our securing funds to provide increased pupilage at Indian residential schools, it is considered that in future it will be necessary to adhere more strictly to the provision of the Indian Act requiring discharge of pupils at 16 years of age.\n\nRev. Geo. Forbes, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Indian Residential School,\nKakawis, B. C.\nI feel you will agree with me that it is not fair to deprive children of education simply because the accommodation that might be available for them in a residential school is being used by those who have had the advantage of residential school training for some years and who have reached the age of 16 years.\n\nUntil further advised you should make arrangements for the discharge of pupils when they reach the age of 16 unless there are some very exceptional circumstances and in this event full particulars should be given to the Department and our permission obtained before such pupils reach the age of 16.\n\nWith the above in mind I desire to hear from you at the earliest possible date stating the date on which the pupil mentioned in the first part of this letter can be discharged from your school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 14, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant you may inform the Principal of the Christie Residential School that the admission of Alma Joe is approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. P.

Of course, he may remain in the school until the school closes for summer holidays.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter I agree with you that it is advisable to allow holidays at the Christie School at a special period of the year and consequently approval is granted for the 1940 holidays at the Christie School being from April 18 to June 18.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to the Indian Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

After speaking to the Indian Agent and to Mr. Inspector Barry immediately after his inspection, and with the hearty approval of the latter, I gave very good reasons to the Indian Agent for Frank's remaining here another year and asked that he be permitted to spend another year here. In a letter dated May 2nd, Mr. Indian Agent Ashbridge wrote: \"I am directed to inform you that the Department approves of the under-mentioned pupils remaining in Christie Residential School for another year; #168, Frank Charlie,...\". It was in the best interests of the Department as well as of the boy that I made the request; he has now a fair chance of being a self-respecting young man instead of being what he was. My predecessor very strongly urged that this boy be discharged or expelled. The boy asked me for another chance and he got it. Father Turner assures me that he is not the same boy that he was. This may be enlightening; he is the only pupil whom I have whipped this year and I did so only because he insisted that I whip him.\n\nTo keep the girls from the canneries as well as the young children whose parents greatly neglect them while working in the canneries, I am again asking that the holidays be from April 13th to June 13th. This is the only time that some parents are at home.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B. C.\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawis, B.C.\n(West Vancouver Island)\nJune 27th, 1940\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nYesterday I sent you a letter and copies of documents by ordinary mail. These deal chiefly with applications for admission to this school of certain Ahousaht children some of whom were in the Ahousaht school although I believe that they should not have been there owing to the fact that they or their parents are Catholics. Since I wrote, Simon Joseph has asked me to accept his two children one of whom was in the Ahousaht school. He (the father) was baptized in the Catholic Church (Opitsaht Register, page 27). You will recall that there was a fight about Rhoda Webster and that it was decided that she attend the Ahousaht and not the Christie School. The father (baptized in the Catholic Church, School Register page 9) brought the girl here last night and asked to have her admitted to this school. She was baptized as an infant (I point this out to show that she was not baptized while the discussion about her was going on) in the Catholic Church (School Register, page 22). The mother was also baptized in the Catholic Church (Opitsaht Register, page 20).\n\nI have done nothing to induce these people to apply for the admission of any of these children to this school. Would you kindly tell me what to do? For certain material advantages (to have their children in a nearby school, for instance) these people may have declared that they were not Catholics but when I have records to show that they are Catholics and when, of their own accord, they ask me to accept their children, may I do so?\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6441, file 879-10, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawis, B.C.\n(West Vancouver Island)\n\nSo far, I have not admitted any and do not intend to do so until I have word from you. It is possible that Bishop Cody may call on the Indian Department in connection with this matter. I do not know whether he will or not but I heard that he had gone East and I know that he is interested in this matter.\n\nI do not think that the Ahousaht day school will solve the problem. In the first place, some of these people belong to Keltsmaht, a reserve which is just a short distance from our School\u2014a twenty minute run from here, and these people spend the summer months at this reserve but move to Ahousaht for the winter. In summer and in winter these people as well as the Ahousaht people are away from their villages fishing and doing other work so that they cannot look after children attending a day school. It has been suggested that such children, that is those whose parents do not remain at home, could be sent to the Alberni School. But that school has no right to accept Catholic children any more than I have to admit Protestant children.\n\nAs I have said, neither the missionaries nor I have invited this trouble. It has naturally arisen and we must face it. I need not add that we shall never try to \"convert\" Protestants just to be able to get their children to this school.\n\nI worked right up until boat time last night and had not the time to write a long letter to you. That is why I enclosed my copy of a letter to the Indian Agent and asked that, if possible, you would kindly return the letter and the copy of documents attached.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6441, file 879-10, part 5)\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawis, B.C.\nJune 26th, 1940\n\nDear Mr Phelan:\n\nI am enclosing copies of letters which I am sending to the Indian Agent so that, when the cases come up, you will know on what grounds I stand. If possible, I would like to have these copies returned at your convenience. I was confidentially told by a certain official to fight cases like these. To avoid unpleasantness some might try to dodge the issue by ordering these children to the Ahousaht day school. The parents want to send the children here but I do not want to accept them until I have an official ruling from the Department. In the past, the Ahousaht School appears to have convinced the Department that Catholic children were not Catholic children. I, therefore, enclose copies of our baptismal records.\n\nWould you kindly get me a ruling on these cases? As I said to the Indian Agent (who has always shown himself fair), it is not a question of a few more children coming to this school. It is a question of principle: Ahousaht must be shown that Catholic children must be admitted to a Catholic school. I happen to know of other cases but I do not intend to bother the Department with them until they are officially brought to my notice.\n\nWhile I must keep the Bishop in touch with developments, I do not want to use this angle as any kind of disguised threat. I have to let him know whether or not Catholic children are or are not in a Catholic School.\n\nI sincerely regret that I must give the Department this trouble.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

Mr. Phelan is at this date absent from the office on holidays and is not likely to return until September 3rd.\n\nThis morning the officials have undertaken a complete search of the records relating to the enrolment of pupils at the Ahousaht Residential School. There is nothing on file here to indicate that the Paul children, sons of Samuel Paul, were ever at any time legally or illegally enrolled at the Ahousaht Residential School. The only Indian pupil named Paul that has been enrolled at that school at any time in recent years was a girl named Hazel Paul, the daughter of Matthew Arnold Paul. This particular pupil was medically examined at the time of her entrance by Dr. J. C. Robertson.\n\nI shall be glad to discuss the claims of the Paul children for admission to the Christie Residential School with Mr. Phelan immediately following his return to the office. I regret, however, that in view of a number of epidemics that have recently broken out at residential schools in other sections of the Dominion, I cannot seriously consider the admission and enrolment of the -\n\nReverend George Forbes, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Indian Residential School,\nKakawis, B.C.\nof the Paul children until they are medically examined. Indian parents are reasonably familiar with the regulations governing the admission of pupils to our schools and it is in my judgment somewhat regrettable that they do not seek to cooperate more effectively with our Principals and thus avoid a great deal of delay and inconvenience in the enrolment of their pupils.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawis, B.C.\nAugust 26th, 1940\n(West Vancouver Island)\n\nDear Mr. Piellin:\n\nThe boat is coming and I am racing against time. Thank you for your letter which came on Aug. 23rd. That letter sets the Dept.'s seal of approval (as well as Bishop Cody's) on my policy. Admit no disputed cases without the Dept.'s approval.\n\nKindly wire collect decision on this case. Sam Paul (Catholic, Kakawis Baptismal Reg., page 12), his wife (Catholic, Opitsaht Register, page 3) wish to have their three sons transferred from Opitsaht Ras. School to this School. Two older boys are Catholics (Kakawis Bapt. Reg., page 44) and youngest has, according to father's statement, never been baptized by anyone. Father took boys to Dr. Cantor for medical examination but, according to father, the Dr. would not examine them without a note from me. The father could not take my note to the Doctor as he called at 5 p.m. and had to be back at his job as night watchman that night. He lives far from here and will not be able to come before Sept. 1st. By that time, there will be no Doctor here. He will not want to take his boys back and as I do not want to admit them, father has signed application forms and I am sending them to the Indian Agent but without the Dr.'s examination. If they were fit to be illegally admitted to Shousaht, they should still be medically fit........\"Illegally\"? I once asked an official of the Department why Catholic children were admitted to a certain non-Catholic School. His reply was that the R.C. missionaries had been asleep. That was unofficial but it was a fact. If I am wrong, wire me. What I intend to do is this: Try to have the father take the boys back until I hear from you (which he won't do); accept the boys only as guests.\n\nYou diplomatically evaded a question; again I ask, how far is the Department prepared to go in backing me up? Should anyone threaten Catholic parents who wish to send their children here?\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\nDear Mr. Hesey:\n\nThank you for your letter of August 29th which has just come. The officials, whom you mentioned, did not find the name of Paul Sam's children on the Ahousaht School register because the children on the West Coast take their father's second name and not his first as their family name. In the Cariboo, Johnnie Jim's children would be Frank Johnnie, Mary Johnnie, etc. Here, they would be Frank Jim, etc. The father's name is Paul Sam (and not Samuel Paul, as in your letter) and his children are Sidney Sam, Stanley Sam and Dixon Sam.\n\nIn letters to the Indian Agent, I have pointed out that I do not blame the Ahousaht authorities for accepting Catholic children. In order to keep their children near them, Catholic parents appear to have declared that they were not Catholic and their word was taken for this. Some non-Catholics would prefer to send their children here rather than to far-away Alberni and would be quite willing, unless I am mistaken, to declare that they are Catholics. In all these cases, I check up on the parents' statements before sending in an application form. Our Baptismal Registers show who is and who is not a Catholic. Thus, I find that Paul Sam, his woman (not wife) and the two older boys are Catholics. The youngest is not a Catholic. The father declares that the boy is not baptized.\n\nThe Indians and we are greatly inconvenienced by there being no Doctor in the vicinity. New-comers cannot be examined.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.

Time of day ........................................ M.D. ........................................\nThe Ahousaht register shows also record of baptism in some cases, and this makes it very difficult to decide, although I understand that priority should determine.\n\nIt may be advisable for representatives of each Church and the Department to conduct an investigation to determine the religion of all families in question, as it would seem that the Ahousaht School cannot survive, there being only nine pupils in attendance at my last inspection.\n\nIt will be noted that medical certificates are not completed. This is due to there being no available Doctor in this district until one is appointed vice Dr. Robertson, resigned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nP. B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent.\n\nPHA/AM\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to forward applications for admission to Christie Residential School of the following:\n\n| Name          | Band     | Age |\n|---------------|----------|-----|\n| Sadie Jack    | Keltsomah | 12  |\n| Larry Jack    | Keltsomah | 11  |\n| Frances David | Clayquot  | 8   |\n| Rose Joseph   | Keltsomah | 7   |\n| Bessie Joseph | Keltsomah | 6   |\n| Lena Titian   | Ahousaht  | 11  |\n\nIt will be noted that Lena Titian, Bessie Joseph and Rose Joseph were pupils at the Ahousaht school, and I quote from the letter of the Rev. Principal explanation as to the reason for these applications:\n\n\"Bessie and Rose Joseph. Their father declares that he is a Catholic and the reference given me in Opitsaht Baptismal Register, page 27, I have looked this up and have found: Simon(sic), born at Keltsomah, in Sept.1907, son of Jimmie and Katie, baptized on Feb.28th,1915 by Father Joseph Schindler. Sponsors, Billie Joseph and Annie. I cannot recall which of the missionaries informed me that this is Simon Joseph. The Keltsomah children tell me that Simon's mother was Katie but they do not know his father's name.\n\nLena Titian\u2014I have no reason to believe that her mother, who is dead, was a Catholic but her step-mother (Tommy Marshall's daughter, Josephine) is a Catholic, as you know, and so is her father. His baptism by Father Tunner is recorded on page 54 of the Opitsaht Register (Baptismal). (That refers to Joe Titian). However, I know that Joe Titian was married by a Catholic Priest, Father Bourne, in 1932 prior to his baptism by Father Tunner. That indicates that either his former wife or Joe Titian was a Catholic in 1935. If his wife was not a Catholic, he was.\"\n\nI feel that the Department should be advised that since the loss of the Residential school at Ahousaht, most of the Indians living at Ahousaht have discovered that they are Catholics. This is borne out in a number of cases by the baptismal register and the history of the Coast shows that the Catholic Church originally established all the missions on the Coast. With the institution of a Protestant School at Ahousaht much later it can only be presumed that the Indians found it convenient to send their children to Ahousaht School, and made false statements as to their religion.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Evans M.D.\nDear Sir:\n\nReceived your letter and application forms and stating that my wife with her father were there wishing to send Rhoda and Basil to that school. Yes, they had the right to call on you because I have been talking about sending my children there but I don't even get a chance to get in touch with you. Always on fishing grounds.\n\nMy children won't get no education if they attend to day-school because I'm away from home most of the time. Can't always stay home just to have my children attending day-school. So I want them to get well educated because I know how it is when you haven't much education it doesn't matter much to me about religion because you two churches are praying to the same God. We got Rhoda to Ahousaht School because Mr Caldwell thought we Indians were just like White people. Did not want to see my children separated to each other that's Rhoda being in Christie School and Basil in Ahousaht School.\n\nWe Indians always get back together even whatever we each one are. Rhoda and Basil would have been sister and brother just the same if Rhoda stayed in Christie School.\n\nI know there'll be quite a time before this is settled. I sure will see you when I come down home. I'll be home on 14th of February from Vancouver.\n\nOf course I'm to sign the forms you send up very kind of you to do that. See you later and good bye. Yours Peter Webster.\n\nExcerpts from Baptismal Registers kept at the Christie School\u2014\n\n1. On the 7th day of September, 1915, I baptized Peter, born Sept., 1907, son of Big William and Bessie, from Keltsemah. Witnesses were Harvey and Cecilia... Sgd. (Rev.) Joseph Schindler, O.M.I.\n\n2. It is a matter of common knowledge that \"Big William\", as he is still called, is William Webster, father of Peter Webster.\n\n3. On the 9th Jan., 1910, I baptized Jessie, born July 11th, 1909, daughter of Tom and Maggie from Keltsemah. Witnesses Mrs George Eye. Sgd. (Rev.) Charles Moser, O.M.I.\n\n4. On the 3rd day of August, 1920, I baptized Rhoda Charity Mary, born April 13th, no year given; the mother states it was 1920, daughter of Peter Webster and Jessie Tom. Witness Josephine Marshall. Signed (Rev.) Victor Rassier.\n\nRe Basil, son of Peter Webster and Jessie Tom.\u2014I am sure that he was not baptized in the Catholic Church and believe that he was baptized as a member of the United Church.\n\n(Rev.) G. Forbes, O.M.I.\nJanuary 31st, 1941\n\nKakawis, B.C.\n\nDr. F.B. Ashbridge,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThank you for your recent letter and also for the paint, lumber, etc., which came on the 23rd. In reply to your question, I beg to state that the wood which the Department found so expensive was for use in the manual training shop. We can very easily do without it.\n\nA few days ago, Mrs. Peter Webster called and stated that she and Peter wished to have their children, Rhoda and Basil, admitted to this school. I pointed out that I could not accept these pupils not only because they had attended the Ahousaht School but because, I have been told, the father made an affidavit to the effect that he is or was a Protestant. However, I agreed to write to the father, to send him application forms and again to submit the case to Ottawa.\n\nEnclosed, please find excerpts from our Baptismal Register. These show that Peter Webster, Jessie Tom, and their child, Rhoda, were all baptized as Catholics. There is no record of Basil's baptism. He was almost certainly baptized as a member of the United Church. The Ahousaht records will show whether my assumption is right or wrong.\n\nThe mother, Jessie Tom, is and has always been a Catholic. The father, Peter, was baptized as a Catholic but I am told that he attended the Ahousaht School. Moreover, when his daughter's case was studied, two or three years ago, I am told that he made an affidavit stating that he was a Protestant. What are the facts and what is the value of that affidavit is what we have to find out. In my letter to Peter (of which I gave you a copy), I asked him to tell me whether he had become a Protestant. He did not reply to this question. I asked him why, since he, his wife and daughter had been baptized as Catholics, he had let the daughter attend the Ahousaht School. At first sight, his answer seems untruthful; Basil was too young to be in school at the time. His meaning, however, seems to be that he did not want his children in different schools and that Mr. Caldwell, who has named, evidently told him that Basil, being a Protestant, would attend the Ahousaht School. He was quite truthful when he wrote: \"It doesn't matter much to me about religion.\" While I am certain that Mr. Caldwell felt that Peter was telling the truth when he made the affidavit, it seems to me that the man's religious affiliations are motivated by his desire to have his children educated. He was baptized as a Catholic and, for all I know, he may have been baptized again as a member of the United Church. Naturally, if he was baptized a second time, no mention of the first baptism would likely have been made. Then, again, if he were a Protestant, why did he have his daughter come here in the first place before she was transferred to Ahousaht? This letter seems to indicate that he allowed steps to be taken or took steps to have Rhoda transferred to the Ahousaht School so that, when her brother was of age to go to school, they would be in the same school. From Peter's letter, it seems to look as if Mr. Caldwell suggested the idea. If he did, I can find nothing wrong in his action. Was not Peter brought up at Ahousaht school? Did he not (I presume he did) attend Protestant services? Did he say anything to let Mr. Caldwell even suspect that he had even been baptized? Had he not had or at least promised to have a younger child baptized by Mr. Caldwell? If he took any, seems to me to have been without blame. Moreover, before he transferred from here to Ahousaht, Mr. Caldwell prudently insisted on getting an affidavit stating that Peter was a Protestant. What was the value of such an affidavit? He may sincerely have become a Protestant. It seems to me that his motives may have been education of his children... About two years ago, Peter called here to see his friend (one of our pupils) and, out of a blue sky, remarked that Rhoda should be here also. The Government had decided otherwise. Would you please submit the case to Ottawa and know how they will decide it. The Department does not wish to see families divided. However, Rhoda is a Catholic and should be here. On the other hand, I fully believe that Basil is not a Catholic and should not be here... unless it can honestly be shown that the father is a Catholic and that the children's religion is judged by himself from...\nion is that although baptized as a Catholic, he was brought up as a Protestant, and that he is not interested in religion but only in the education of his children. Shortly before I came here, he appears to have given a very clear sign that he wished to act as a Catholic. A little later, he gave quite as clear a sign to the contrary... His wife asked Father Leo (the letter is still here) to baptize a younger child. Father Leo went to Monsignor Caldwell to let him do the baptizing.\n\nThere are further details but you know them. What I have said, I have tried to say fairly.\n\nMy policy has been not to admit a disputed case until the Department had approved of the admission of the child to this school. A few days ago, I broke this rule. Martin Charlie, about to go fishing, sent his son here with an uncle. At the time, as well as just before and after it, the sea was very rough and the boy's clothes were soaking. Rather than send the boy back and risk another soaking, I let him stay but pointed out to the uncle that I would keep the boy only as a guest until word came from Ottawa. An application form for his admission had already been sent in for Ottawa's consideration.

J. Kasagrande, M.D.\nOttawa, 27th August, 1945.\n\nMr. R.H. Moore, Indian Agent, Duncan, B.C.,\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant with reference to two sons of Tommy George.\n\nWhile I agree with you that the parents should accept their responsibility in training their children properly, at the same time if they do not do so I feel there is no reason why we should allow the children to suffer. If these boys should remain at home and continue to act as mentioned in the third para of your letter, it is possible that their actions may become more serious.\n\nTaking everything into consideration, I feel that they should be placed in the Christie Residential School provided they are physically fit.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have had a request from Tommy George of the Songhees Band to allow his two sons of 10 and 12 years old to attend the Christie Residential School in the West Coast Agency, and to which the Principal of the School has agreed if the approval of the Dept. can be obtained.\n\nIn this connection I may say that one of the Priests connected with Indian Missionary work in the Agency and on the Songhees Reserve in particular discussed the matter with me today. I explained to him that the policy of the Dept. was to encourage Indian children to attend the schools on their reserve providing they were of the same religious denomination and the parents of the children were able to support them and that the home conditions were also satisfactory. In this particular case, home conditions are satisfactory, the parents can give the necessary home care and support, but are weak in discipline the result being that their two sons are doing much as they please around their home reserve and will eventually get into trouble.\n\nPreviously, these lads attended the Songhees Indian Day School but were not particular regular in their attendance, playing hockey on many occasions, which after all could not be laid at the door of their parents. The whole setup as I see it is this: \"Does the Department wish to allow the parents of these children to shirk their responsibilities as parents with respect to the discipline and support of their two boys, or do you feel that in the interests of the boys themselves we might be doing more good by allowing them to go to the Residential school?\" I hardly know just what to recommend in this case as I feel that there is no good and sufficient reason why the boys should not go to their reserve day school, other than the fact that their parents are not strict enough with them and they may eventually get into a lot of trouble.

Last year when I submitted receipts I asked for an increase in the travel grant and did not even receive a reply from the agent much less an increase.\n\nThis year I am again submitting a request to have the grant raised to $300.00. Other schools have received an increase but this one had the grant cut in half a few years ago. I have had an additional expenditure of $58.00 for transportation bringing the total over $400.00. The grant allowed at this time is a small fraction of this amount. I think the Department should take into consideration the cost of transportation in this locality.\n\nWould you kindly forward this request to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. P.

W. A. Gray M.D.\n1. On this date the undersigned letter was forwarded to this Detachment by Mr. H.M. Taylor, Indian Agent, for Vancouver Survey, which is self explanatory.\n\nDEPUTY\n\nDear Mr. Taylor,\n\nI received a letter from the Principal of the Christie Residential School advising that a Mary Lucas, the mother of one of his pupils \"Henry Jones\" (14) intended to keep him out of school and that this would be unfortunate as she is not a proper guardian for him as she was probably living with her own parents and family before.\n\nI have written to Mary Lucas instructing her to return the boy to school and that the only exception I could make to his not returning was that of sickness or other unavoidable cause.\n\nThe reply I received is to the effect that she was not well and that the boy was required to do the work around the house.\n\nI believe you have the services of a Constable in your district who if he could sometime, when he is in that neighbourhood, make a few inquiries regarding this case, I would be obliged as I am of the opinion that this is an excuse to get him working.\n\nMary Lucas's Address is: St. Jameson Cannery Nelson Bros., Fishermen, New Westminster, B.C.\n\nSgd. H.M. Taylor\n\n2. Whilst on patrol at the above named place the writer interviewed the file subject this same date. Her excuse to the writer was that, in view of the fact that she is pregnant she has been ill and needed the boy to help her. However, a check in the Cannery Time Office disproved the story that she had been ill because no time had been lost since she had been employed there. She was in good health. She informed the writer that she did not expect the baby until sometime in December.\n\n3. In view of the foregoing a written order was served on the file subject to cause the attendance at school of her son \"Henry Jones\". At the time this order was served Mary informed the writer that she would have to wait till payday before she could take the boy away, so she was advised to contact Mr. Taylor, Indian Agent, at Vancouver, B.C.\n\n4. On this date a patrol was made to the Cannery by the writer where it was ascertained that the file subject...\n...Cont'd. - had removed the boy on the 5th of October and had returned to the Cariboo on the 15th instant by himself. The boy presumably having been sent to school. Unfortunately at the time of the writer's visit the file subject was not available for interview.\n\n5. There is no suggestion at this point of the file subject living with any other person.\n\nCONCLUDED NO EXPENSE\n\nFORO\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., VANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nThe Commissioner, B.C.M.P., OTTAWA, Ontario.\n\n1.

Does this apply to Residential Schools as well as Day Schools? My reason for asking this question - the length of the Christmas holidays. Will the children be allowed to go home for the two weeks at Christmas?\n\nSecondly, I notice the last day of the school year is June 25th. Do you...\nthis mean that there will be\na longer authorized holiday?\nFor the past few years\nthe Alberni Residential School has\nbeen closing in the middle of\nJune. The children from this\ndistrict were home on June 14th\nthis year. The parents have been\ncomplaining to me that I do\nnot give as long holidays as\nthe other schools. In fact one\nof the parents wrote to his children\nand said he thought of transferring\nthem to the Alberni School to take\nadvantage of the longer vacation.\nDo you think it would be sufficient\nreason to close this school in\nthe middle of June also?\nDuring the past years\nI have brought the children back at the end of 62 days but this year I feel I cannot bring them back before September the first, the date of opening of the other school. It will mean 65 days holidays. On the September returns will I give 89 days instead 92 days as the number of days in the quarter?\n\nSorry to ask so many questions \u2014 I remain\n\nYours Truly\nJH MacLachlan\nCLOSED\n\nSee VOL 8\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6441)\n\nFile 879-10, part 4\nWest Coast Agency \u2013 Christie Residential School \u2013 Admissions & Discharges, 1936\n\nFile 879-10, part 5\nWest Coast Agency \u2013 Christie Residential School \u2013 Admissions & Discharges, 1937 \u2013 1942\n\nFile 879-10, part 6\nWest Coast Agency \u2013 Christie Residential School \u2013 Admissions & Discharges, 1942 \u2013 1947\n\nFile 879-10, part 7\nWest Coast Agency \u2013 Christie Residential School \u2013 Admissions & Discharges, 1947 \u2013 1952\n\nFile 879-11, part 1\nWest Coast Agency \u2013 Christie Residential School \u2013 Vocational Training \u2013 Supplies \u2013 Accounts, 1929 \u2013 1939\n\nFile 879-11, part 2\nWest Coast Agency \u2013 Christie Residential School \u2013 Vocational Training \u2013 Supplies \u2013 Accounts, 1939 \u2013 1949\n\nFile 879-23, part 1\nWest Coast Agency \u2013 Christie Residential School \u2013 Death of Pupils, 1935 \u2013 1944\n## INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\n### DEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\n\n**SUBJECT**: CHRISTIE\n\n**RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL**\n\n**ADMISSIONS AND DISCHARGES**\n\n| Reference | Name | Date | PA | Disposal |\n|-----------|------|------|----|----------|\n| 325       | SM   | 8356 |    |          |\n| 36         | SM   | 6452 |    |          |\n| 39         | SM   | 6455 |    |          |\n| E1         |      |      |    |          |\n| E2         |      |      |    |          |\n| E3         |      |      |    |          |\n| E4         |      |      |    |          |\n| E5         |      |      |    |          |\n| E6         |      |      |    |          |\n| E7         |      |      |    |          |\n| E8         |      |      |    |          |\n| E9         |      |      |    |          |\n| E10        |      |      |    |          |\n| E11        |      |      |    |          |\n| E12        |      |      |    |          |\n| E13        |      |      |    |          |\n| E14        |      |      |    |          |\n| E15        |      |      |    |          |\n| E16        |      |      |    |          |\n| E17        |      |      |    |          |\n| E18        |      |      |    |          |\n| E19        |      |      |    |          |\n| E20        |      |      |    |          |\n| E21        |      |      |    |          |\n| E22        |      |      |    |          |\n| E23        |      |      |    |          |\n| E24        |      |      |    |          |\n| E25        |      |      |    |          |\n| E26        |      |      |    |          |\n| E27        |      |      |    |          |\n| E28        |      |      |    |          |\n| E29        |      |      |    |          |\n| E30        |      |      |    |          |\n| E31        |      |      |    |          |\n| E32        |      |      |    |          |\n| E33        |      |      |    |          |\n| E34        |      |      |    |          |\n| E35        |      |      |    |          |\n| E36        |      |      |    |          |\n\n---\n\n**DO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE**\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6441, file 879-10, part 7)\n\n---\n\n**PUBLIC ARCHIVES**\n\n**ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES**\n\n**CANADA**\n\n---\n\n**POOR COPY**\n| Date       | F.A.

In the past residential schools have closed on July 1st and reopened on September 1st, which is, of course, exactly 62 days.\n\nIn certain districts, owing to local conditions we know that some schools close two or three days earlier or even may be delayed a day or so after September 1st and we do not make any cut in the grant. However, generally speaking we expect all residential schools to observe the regulations, namely 62 days holidays with grant.\n\nI cannot understand why Alberni School should close as early as stated in your letter and I am communicating with the principal in this regard.\n\nIn preparing the September return the number of days in the quarter should be shown as 92 and grant should be requested for each pupil for the actual number of days such pupil is in residence during the September quarter, plus 62 days holiday grant.\n\nWe have not made any definite ruling yet in connection with allowing children to go home from\nresidential schools at Christmas. There has been considerable agitation on the part of some Indians to have this privilege allowed and it is a question that has been before the Department on very many occasions during the past twenty years.\n\nWe have always felt that in the majority of cases at least, we would simply be looking for trouble if we allowed the children home for Christmas. It might be alright in the case of children whose home reserve is very close to the residential school. However, if the children have to travel in the winter time a considerable distance, there is always the danger of them developing some illness as a result of changed conditions on the reserve from those in the residential school. Inevitably there would also be delays in returning in many cases, possibly due to climatic conditions over which none of us have any control.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Heating is needed except the distribution of fire in the school.\n\n2. Washing machine present one worn out new one needed.\n\n3. Some carpenters tools for training of boys needed.\n\n4. Sewing machines.\n   The sewing machines in use are very much worn but are still in use. The number was never sufficient hence the heavy wear of those 3 new ordinary machines and one heavy tailor needed.\nThe fire escape is being from the dormitory windows, informative means of escape should the fire occur in the lower part of the school so that stairways are cut off, the last distance from the ground is too great to be safe for smaller boys to climb.\nSir:\n\nWith the consent of Mr. E. E. Frost, Indian Agent of this Agency, on visit to the Christie Indian Residential School at my special request, I am enclosing this letter with his memorandum to you of his findings here. I have asked his leave to do this in order that you may have my explanation of requests which may perhaps be unusual. I am hoping that you will favor me with a direct reply; through Mr. Frost, if you wish, that through this direct contact I, a new Principal, may be helped to understand and appreciate your attitude toward matters of this nature.\n\nThere are three items which Mr. Frost and I discussed at length concerning which I am anxious for you to have my view. These three items are: (1) sewing machines, (2) carpenter tools, and (3) tools and gasoline engine.\n\nYou will agree with me, I am sure, that besides instruction in English, arithmetic, etc., the Indian should be instructed in that which will prove of practical use to him after he leaves school. For the female Indian there should be instruction in sewing. Sister Superior and the Sister in charge of that class at Christie School and I have gone over the subject thoroughly. What we would like to have the Department help us do is to make it possible to have every girl attending Christie School attend a class in sewing when she reaches a certain age. Ordinarily there would be about fifteen individuals in such a class at one time. That means to conduct the class with satisfactory results the Sister should have available eleven sewing machines. She informs me that these eleven machines would be in use during practically all and every class; in other words, that the number of machines we say we need is not overestimated. At present there are six sewing machines in the school. Of these four are fit for use and two are not. We would, therefore, respectfully ask of the Department seven new sewing machines to complete the number of eleven we need to conduct this class in sewing satisfactorily.\n\nAs to the question of carpenter tools: the male Indian has ample need of an elementary knowledge of carpentry. I do not think the subject requires any amplification. My suggestion is that the only thing needed would be to have a class in carpentry in a carpenter shop for the purpose. The more expensive and heavier tools would be the property of the school and placed at the disposal of the student during class hours. The smaller tools, saw, hammer, etc., would be supplied in sets to each student, be placed in a box to be taken home by him when he receives his discharge, and returned to the school be kept in an individual locker or cabinet in the carpentry shop for him for class duty. It appears to me this feature would be of great benefit to the student and would militate against loss or abuse of the tools. In connection with this matter, will the Department negotiate further with me regarding the following: (1) the equipment of the School with the tools necessary for conducting classes in sewing and carpentry; (2) the supply of the material such as lumber, nails, etc., required for the use of each student; (3) a grant or allowance for the instructor.\n\nSewing machines and gasoline engine: those familiar with the habits of life...\nbe used in the manual training class and will provide a grant towards the salary of an instructor. If you will prepare a detailed list of what is required, with an estimate of the total cost, and forward it to Mr. Frost, it will be given consideration.\n\nThe foregoing remarks may be repeated in connection with a gasoline engine for demonstration and instruction purposes and a few tools for the conduct of a class in internal combustion and marine engines. Would it be possible to have the same instructor handle this class as well as the manual training? Let Mr. Frost have a detailed list of what is required and an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn the list attached to your letter, there was mention made of repairs to the heating system, replacement of the washing machine and better fire escapes from the boys' dormitory. I regret that there are no funds provided for these purposes, but I am writing to Mr. Frost with a view to learning just what is required to minimize the risk of loss of life in the event of fire.\n\nI may add, for your information, that a copy of this letter is being forwarded to the Indian Agent for his guidance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. H. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawis, B.C.\n(WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND)\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs #2\n\nof the West Coast Indian agree unanimously that he will not do anything but fish for a livelihood. Conversation with Indian boys attending Christie School has revealed to me that the ambition of practically every boy is to own a fishing launch as do his elders after he receives his discharge. This fact suggests the desirability of the Indian having a thorough knowledge of a gasoline engine and some knowledge of electricity. I propose dealing with this phase of the Indians' education in this manner; a class in these two subjects. Will the Department, therefore, negotiate with me these points: (1) the equipment of the school with the necessary tools to conduct such a class; (2) the equipment of the school or some kind of gasoline engine to be used for demonstration and instruction purposes; (3) a grant or allowance for the instructor of such a class.\n\nMay I, for the benefit of those to whom this perhaps unusual letter is addressed, explain, that, having been appointed to the position of Principal of the Christie Indian Residential School with the understanding that the appointment is to be permanent, I purpose to work for the welfare of the Indians in my charge with all the talent I possess and with all the zeal, earnestness and determination I can command. I bring to my task an experience of practically sixteen years in the education of youth, during which time I served as professor, disciplinarian and college-president. The problems I meet in my new field of endeavor I hope to solve satisfactorily, with the information I have acquired during that time, ably assisted by the advice and guidance of the capable gentlemen under whose supervision it is my good fortune to find myself. It is my purpose to bend every effort to realize the objectives the Department wishes the School to realize and to do so by a conscientious observance of the laws and regulations the Department has laid down for my guidance.\n\nI am at pains to express myself in this manner because I would instil in the members of the Department the hope that whatever shortcomings may have been in evidence in the past management of Christie School, better things are in prospect.\n\nVery truly and respectfully yours,\n\nVictor Rassier\n(Rev.)

(RG 10, Volume 6441, file 879-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, April 3, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th ultimo, with reference to your aims at the Christie Indian Residential School. The Department has read your letter with interest and is very hopeful that there will be a career of much usefulness in your case. The rules for visiting Indians appear to be quite satisfactory. I may say, at the outset, that your proposals concerning vocational training meet with the hearty approval of the Department and you will receive our cooperation as far as is consistent with our general practice in this connection.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that four sewing machines and one tailoring machine will be ordered for the use of the school. I regret the Department is unable to grant a larger number, as Indian schools with the accommodation of the Christie institution have never been supplied with more than this number. It may be possible for the Sister in charge of the sewing class to divide her pupils in two groups for purposes of instruction on the machines.\n\nThe Department will cooperate with you in the matter of manual training, and I wish you would forward to Mr. Indian Agent Frost a list of the tools which should be supplied. As you have pointed out in your letter, there will be required, not only a general set, but also individual sets for the use of each pupil in the class. The Department is not prepared to allow these pupils to consider the tools their own. If, upon graduation, you would bring the case of a boy with a good record to Mr. Frost's attention, some help might be given if he is prepared to make immediate use of whatever assistance is allowed. The Department will allow a reasonable amount for materials.\n\nRev. Victor Massier, O.S.B.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Indian Residential School,\nKakwa, B.C.\nOttawa, April 3, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information and guidance, copy of my letter of today's date to the Rev. Father Victor Rossier, O. S. B., Principal of the Christie Indian Residential School. You will note that he will let you have a detailed list and estimate of the cost of the equipment necessary for classes in carpentry and internal combustion engines. Under separate cover, there will be a further letter directed to you, arising out of the subject matter of my letter to the Reverend Principal.\n\nENCL.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nB. C.\nYour File 159-0-11.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of letter of the Deputy Minister dated the 23rd ultimo asking me to see what could be done in the way of purchasing a launch for the use of the Christie School, at Clayoquot, West Coast Agency, and that the meditated expenditure in this connection would be approximately $3,500.00 for a boat 35 or 37 ft. long.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that on the 26th ultimo Reverend Father Victor, the Principal of the School, called at this office on his return from Ottawa, and the matter of acquiring a launch was discussed. I informed him, as I am informing you, that I am strongly of the opinion that it would not be possible to obtain a launch 35 or 37 ft. long, suitable for the West Coast waters, for the sum of $3,500.00.\n\nI have learned, however, that there is in Victoria Harbour at the present time a fishing vessel No. 557 GA seized by the Fishery Department some little time ago which, I believe, with some alteration, would answer our purpose. The dimensions of this vessel are length 36' over all, beam 11'5\" draft 3'6\", and it has an \"Enterprise\" gasoline engine of 15--17 horsepower. This vessel is now in the hands of the sheriff and will be sold unless it is expropriated by the Government for public purposes as provided for under Section 17 of the \"Customs and Fisheries Protection Act\" being Chapter 43 Revised Statutes, 1927, a typewritten copy of the Section being hereto attached.\n\nI spoke to the Reverend Principal of the School with regard to this boat, but he thought possibly he might be able to get one built in the vicinity of Clayoquot for the $3,500.00 provided by the Department and, if not, he was prepared to put in a small sum himself.\n\nI still have my doubts as to whether any decent sea-going boat could be purchased for anywhere near the sum mentioned, but we could have this boat (No. 557 GA) expropriated for public use. Any alterations necessary should be done for considerably less than the $3,500.00. There, of course, will be certain fees to be paid if the boat is taken over, as the sheriff has now a watchman on board and the expenditure in this connection already amounts to something over $300.00.\n\nI may say that a somewhat larger boat known as the \"Catherine B\" was also seized some time ago and is lying at Prince Rupert. But this vessel, under the Section referred\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nto, has been taken over by the Department of Fisheries for public service. I think this will be the best thing to do with regard to boat \"557 GA\".\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nSale of goods 17.

Father Victor, O.S.B., Principal of the Christie Indian Residential School, and I wish to state that it is the Department's intention to assist him in his effort to make the work at this institution really efficient. One of the most urgent needs is a launch with pilot cabin and good marine engine. I am asking you to go to the proper sources with a view to having such a boat built or purchased, if something suitable is on the market. I have in mind an expenditure of approximately $3,500 for a boat 35 or 37 ft. long. You might let me have an interim report, indicating what arrangements are possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. R. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\nCHRISTIE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nKamloops, B.C., April 17, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPermit me to thank you for your valued favor No. 159-0-11, under date of the 3rd instant. I am very grateful to the Department for the sewing machines and for the cooperation and assistance it promises me in the matter of manual training. In accordance with the recommendations contained in your letter I will, as soon as I have given more thought and study to the matter, submit to Mr. Frost a detailed list and estimated cost of what is required to carry out our programme of instruction in carpentry and internal combustion and marine engines. It will be possible, I am quite certain, to have the same instructor handle both classes.\n\nMay I respectfully request the Department to reconsider the number of sewing machines it has seen fit to send the Christie school? It seems to me there must be some misunderstanding. The matter has gone over very carefully by the Indian agent, Mr. Frost and myself with the Sister in charge of our sewing department, and we cut down our needs to the very limit of what was deemed necessary to carry on the class efficiently and without disorganizing seriously the girls' department - so easily done because of the unsatisfactory conditions here and over which we have no control.\n\nFurthermore, in taking over this position, I am most desirous to train our boys and girls well in the work they will be called upon to do after leaving school; and I can't conceive, after the encouraging tone of your letter as regards training of boys in their subjects, the Department handicapping me in my efforts for the girls for the sake of two sewing machines, unless there be some misunderstanding.\n\nAnd it is only because I feel certain that there is a misunderstanding that I am making bold to trouble the Department to rehear the situation. I am sure after this explanation it will reconsider the matter and oblige the school as per my original request.\n\nVictor Rassier, O.S.B.\nOttawa, September 19, 1929.\n\nW. E.

As there has been recent correspondence with Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn in this connection, the Department is instructing the Rev. Principal to send the list to the Commissioner. I write this letter so that your file will be complete and so that you will be aware of what is taking place in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. E. Frost, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Alberni,\nB. C.\nOttawa, October 23, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 188/15/16552 of the 9th instant, with reference to manual and technical training classes at the Christie Indian Residential School. You may supply the regular carpenter's tools allowed for this school and in addition, $200 worth of machine tools. You may also authorize the Rev. Principal to expend approximately $100 in the purchase of a second hand gas engine for instructional purposes.\n\nThe Rev. Principal has recently written the Department in connection with the establishment of these classes, and he has shown evidence of undertaking the work seriously and intelligently. He plans to erect a model house of small proportions, which will stand as an example to the boys in the manual training class and to visiting Indians. He refers to this as his idea for \"An ideal Indian dwelling on the West Coast as to arrangement and construction.\" He feels there should be more tools than on the list submitted by yourself when he visited in your office a few weeks ago. If this supplementary list comes to your attention, if you consider the articles necessary for the Principal's purposes, you may make the purchase.\n\nThe Rev. Principal also wishes a little help in fixing up the manual training room. Tool cabinets, etc., are required. I am asking him to submit to you an estimate of the cost. When this is to hand, you might forward it to the Department with your recommendation.\n\nAs in the case of the other schools, the Department is allowing $40 per month towards the instructor's salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Department concurs in your plan to have the class erect a small model house, and, when the supplementary list of tools is received, favourable consideration will be given and instructions issued to Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn in connection with the purchase.\n\nConcerning a work bench for the instructor, I believe that you should get along with the 12 benches that Mr. Ditchburn has already authorized. You may forward to his office an estimate of the cost of fitting up the room for manual training with tool cabinets, etc. Mr. Ditchburn has been requested to supply you with the tools that are necessary, and he will write to you, authorizing the purchase of a second hand gas engine at a cost of approximately $100. Mr. Ditchburn has also been instructed to supply machine tools to the value of $200.\n\nI note with satisfaction that you have secured a suitable instructor for these classes and that you are paying him $75 per month and board. The Department will allow a grant of $40 per month towards his salary, and this will be paid upon receipt of a voucher, in duplicate, once every three months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Father Victor, O. S. B.,\nPrincipal,\nChristie Indian Residential School,\nKakawis, B. C.\nChristie Indian Residential School\nKakawin, B.C.\n(West Coast Vancouver Island)\n\nOctober 7, 1929\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis letter is a reply to your communication dated the 28th ult., file number 159-011, re: \"manual training classes for the boys at the Christie Indian Residential School.\"\n\nMr. Commissioner Ditchburn, on my return from the East, instructed me to report to him on the matter which I did. My list of tools, however, was substituted by another, to which action of the Commissioner I was quite agreeable. Now, however, since the Department has revived the subject as pertains to me, I am taking the liberty of expressing to it certain recommendations as I received these from the instructor I have engaged.\n\nThe work we have outlined departs radically, I am told, from the usual instruction imparted in manual training classes. We have kept in mind the ultimate purpose this class is intended to serve. I will mention but one of them: the building and furnishing of a house. The instructor has in mind to lead the class along step by step in the manufacture and construction of all that is necessary for this, eventually, if possible, having each boy of the class build a miniature house. He has in mind, moreover, the erection of a house of small proportions by the entire class, the plan of which, after careful study, would be an attempt to present to the members of the class and to Indians visiting the school, the ideal Indian dwelling on the West Coast as to arrangement and construction.\n\nUnfortunately, the tools on the list submitted by Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn are inadequate for this purpose. Not, therefore, as an expression of disapproval of his action, but to expedite matters in case the Department should wish us to proceed in the manner outlined, I am forwarding to McLennan, McFeely & Prior of Vancouver, B.C., a supplementary list with instructions to send an estimate of their cost to you direct.\n\nMr. Commissioner Ditchburn has furthermore instructed me to proceed with the construction of twelve work-benches for as many members of the class, the cost of which is not to exceed $12.00 a piece. I intended to call his attention to the fact that material for an instructor's bench and tool-cabinets (with locks) was thereby left out of consideration. Now, however, I shall take this opportunity to suggest to you my recommendations, namely, that the Department, with a view to assist the school to the extent implied, instruct me to submit rough plans for the space we have set aside for our student carpenter shop and an estimate of the cost of the lumber and material it would require to make the room reasonably serviceable for our purpose. The Department may reply that I should be able to buy such extras from my grant, but the truth is I find providing the extras not covered by the estimate for the present improvements is necessitating my being quite frugal with expenditures.\nFinally, permit me to say that I entertain bright hopes for the success of this class. I intend to prosecute its possibilities energetically, of course, on the condition the Department so desires. I used the opportunity offered by my presence in Vancouver on returning from the East to engage an instructor for the work; the gentleman's salary being $75.00 a month and board from September 8th on. I was more or less compelled to this premature action by the nature of circumstances here at school which make it most inconvenient for me to get away. I trust that the Department understands my situation and will contribute toward the instructor's salary accordingly.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nVictor Rassier, O.S.B.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been having some correspondence with Reverend Father Victor, Principal of the Christie School, with regard to the establishing of manual and technical training classes in that institution, and in a recent letter he quoted an excerpt from his letter to yourself of the 5th of March last, and your reply of the 12th of April on that particular subject. The Principal supplied me with a list of carpenters' tools required for his class of twelve pupils, and also a considerable list of machinists' tools as well as a request for a gasoline engine to be used among the pupils for demonstrating purposes.\n\nIn my reply to the Principal, I pointed out that the list of carpenters' tools was not in line with the equipment that has been supplied to other schools, and it was the desire of the Department that all the schools should be uniformly equipped so far as the carpenter shops were concerned, and I furnished him with a list of what had already been supplied last year to ten of our residential schools in the Province, and this is quite agreeable to him. Reverend Father Victor apparently has hired a competent mechanic who is capable of giving instruction in the carpentry shop as well as the machine shop, and, with regard to the latter, I am herebelow quoting from his letter of the 26th ultimo for your information:\n\n\"Your letter calls for information as to the purpose of the engine and the horse-power required. The engine is to serve demonstration purposes to the class taking instruction. Among other things, the instructor intends to have the class take the engine apart, know the purposes of each part, be able to assemble the engine; he purposes to stall the engine in various ways and have the members of the class detect and remedy the trouble, etc., etc.\n\n\"For this a new engine is not absolutely necessary; in fact, a second hand one might be better for our purpose. It should, however, be complete (battery and high tension magneto), and of any type (naval or medium duty) make (Easthope, Palmer, Universal), Engle, Raylins, etc., etc., and horsepower (six to eight) used by the Indians on the West Coast on their fishing boats.\n\n\"It is possible that we might be able to secure such a second-hand engine in the immediate neighborhood. If it is your wish we would make investigations and, finding a suitable one, get the owner to submit an estimate to you.\"\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSo......\nSo far as the cost of the equipment is concerned, that for the carpentry shop is estimated to be approximately $550.00 and the engine tools about $200.00. The gasoline self-ignition Fairbanks-Morse engine costs $385.00, but it is possible a second-hand engine could be picked up in the district that would suit the purpose of the School. The total cost of this equipment, therefore, would be approximately $1,000.00, and I would be pleased to know how far you are prepared to go in this direction. The carpentry tools undoubtedly should be purchased, and if you so authorize, I will place an order for them. If the money is available, I would also recommend that the machinists' tools be purchased, and the Principal be written to to see what he can do in the way of obtaining a second-hand engine in the district for demonstrating purposes.\n\nReverend Father Victor, while being a new man, seems to have the proper idea of what is necessary in the way of giving the Indians of the West Coast a good practical training, and I am of the opinion that he should be encouraged by the Department in this direction so far as it is possible to do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

The account, in favour of the contractor, should be supported by the plans and specifications and the contractor's quotation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe-Launch for Christie School.\n\nI beg to confirm my wire to you of today's date reading as hereunder:\n\n\"Re launch Kakawis School. Rev. Father Victor feels certain he can get a suitable launch constructed for amount Department prepared to spend, therefore not necessary to take any further action with regard to seized fishing boat Five Five Seven G A. Writing.\"\n\nIn explanation I may say that on the 12th ultimo I wrote to Mr. McLean, in your absence, that there was an American fishing boat in Victoria Harbor which had been seized by the Fisheries Department that I considered might be reconditioned and made suitable for the purposes of the school, and Mr. McLean wired me asking if Father Victor would be satisfied. I also wrote to the Reverend Principal on the same date on this subject.\n\nI have, however, today received a reply from the Reverend Principal in which he informs me he is satisfied he can get a launch built for the amount which the Department is prepared to expend. The letter of the Principal is attached hereto for your information and goes on to show just how this is to be accomplished.\n\nIn view of this phase of the question I have instructed him to proceed with the getting out of the plans and specifications.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nspecifications and to obtain the tender for the construction of the launch according to the same, after which the tender, plans and specifications should be submitted to this office for approval. Possibly, however, you may wish to make the grant of $3,500.00 direct to the School and leave the details in connection with the construction of the launch up to the Reverend Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nCHRISTIE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nKAKAWIS, B.C., Sept. 26, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of the 19th instant, No.101/15/15456, was duly received. I am making haste to answer in accordance with the request with which it terminated, and I beg you to consider the nature of this reply prompted by the same motives that suggested the contents of your letter, namely, a desire to advance the interests of your Department.\n\nThe launch I suggested to the Department on my visit to Ottawa is part of a program I devised and have been adhering to scrupulously in my efforts to accomplish the work I conceive it is the Department's wish I should do. Before going to Ottawa, I had for months thought over this launch and had heard from those capable of giving it. It was to the naval architect presented the fruition of these painstaking efforts, and the plans he is finishing will be for a launch such as will best contribute to the objective for which the idea of the launch was conceived in the first place.\n\nUnfortunately, the kind of boat you describe in your letter will not adapt itself to my purpose. It is for this reason, that I beg you not to consider me as discarding the sound sense and prudent judgment which I have learned to know you to possess so abundantly, when I make bold to suggest that you empower me to proceed in the manner it is possible for me to do here.\n\nAfter receiving your letter, I again went over the position with the gentleman I spoke to you about, and again he assured me that he would not charge me more than the $3,500.00 in carrying out the plans of the architect. I accept your statement that on its face this is impossible. However, when I explain that the gentleman in question, whose work is highly commended hereabouts, is an old ship-builder, is fond of the mission, has taken a liking to me, and regards the commission of making the launch with a certain amount of pride and as an opportunity to assist a most laudable undertaking, you will find it easier to understand why the sum of $3,500.00 will be quite ample. All the more so, when I add that his son is almost capable machinist and also interested in the underlying motives that actuate the father; while the owner of a mill in the neighborhood has guaranteed all the lumber that is acceptable for the launch as a means of reimbursing the Church for timber he wishes to remove from land belonging to it and which is located near his mill.\n\nI am at pains to disclose these details at the risk of trying your patience because, on the one hand, I do not want you to think me\u2014paradox the expression\u2014half-hearted or inclined to oppose the wishes of capable superiors; on the other hand, I am very anxious to have the launch be in every way the asset to my labors it was originally conceived it would be. And because you are a man to whom one may trust a frank expression of opinion, I am not hesitating to declare myself in this manner. I have reason...\n\nMr. W.M. Pritchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVictoria, B.C.\nreason to know that your assistance and cooperation can be expected by those giving evidence of protecting and promoting the interests of your Department; and trusting that this letter reveals me as trying faithfully to accomplish this, I am hopeful of your favourable consideration of my request.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(Sgd.)

It occurred to me that you would not hesitate to help us out to the extent of providing what he deems necessary for his purposes, especially since you realize how difficult it is for me to get away to the city to procure it.

(RG 10, Volume 6441, file 879-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES CANADA\n\nFOOD COPY\nEXTRACT from Report of H. H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B. C., regarding his inspection of the Christie Indian Residential School on September 2nd, 1931, and forwarded under cover of Commissioner Ditchburn's letter of September 25th, 1931.\n\nOriginal on File 159-0-6.\n\nMANUAL TRAINING:\n\nThere are two classes of six boys each. Manual training is taught on two afternoons per week. The room used is about 45 ft. by 12 ft. and contains seven single benches. Each boy has a set of tools and there is a set for the instructor. These thirteen sets are in good condition.\n\nSuch articles as chicken coops and tables are made. No special course seems to be followed. The instructor is Mr. J. J. Kendrick. Mr. Kendrick does not appear to have had any particular training or certificate in Manual training.\nDear Sir:\n\nSome time ago I received a communication from Reverend Victor Essier, Principal of the Christie Indian Residential School, at Kakawin on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, asking me if it would be possible for the Department to let him have about two thousand feet of well-seasoned clear cedar 1\" x 12\" x 12' long for manual training purposes.\n\nAfter ascertaining from the local mills that the price of clear cedar was $65.00 per M. f.o.b. Victoria, I wrote the Reverend Principal asking him what this material was to be used for and his reply was to the effect that it was for the purpose of constructing lockers for the children and that the work would prove instructive to the boys in their manual training class.\n\nMy reply, dated the 1st ultimo, was to the effect that while I considered the work of constructing the lockers would prove instructive to the children, it was thought the expense of the construction could not be charged against the Manual Training Vote as the lockers themselves must be considered as an improvement to the building and while I considered such lockers were necessary I would have to apply to you for permission before any purchase could be made. I further added that in view of the high cost of cedar and the difficulty of getting the amount he asked for, he was requested to let me know whether kiln-dried fir would not answer his purpose as this could be purchased at between $35.00 and $40.00 per M.\n\nThe Reverend Principal's latest reply was to the effect that he would be satisfied if we could supply him with two thousand feet of clear fir and I, therefore, beg to ask your authority to purchase this material and have it shipped up the West Coast.\n\nThe Sidney Lumber Company, Cameron Lumber Company and Lemon, Gonnason Company, quoted a price of $45.00 per M. f.o.b. Victoria. The latter will necessarily be higher if the material is shipped from the Sidney Lumber Company as it would have to be handled a distance of twenty miles from Sidney to Victoria before being put aboard the West Coast boat. I am of the opinion that Lemon, Gonnason Company would be the best firm to purchase from in view of the fact that the Cameron Lumber Company is owned by American citizens though residents of Victoria.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nW.
