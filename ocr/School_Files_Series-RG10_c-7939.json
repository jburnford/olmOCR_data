Many posts have either broken off or have heaved out of the ground, wires are rusty and broken in many places beyond repair. We are not very busy these days and would gladly rebuild these fences if we had the wire and posts. I think that probably $150.00 would be sufficient to cover the cost. The work really needs to be done and owing to there being so much unemployment I think that the time is most opportune. We will also need a small grant for new belts for the machinery in our laundry. I think that probably $25.00 will be sufficient.\n\nI am pleased to say that never has our attendance been as large as it is this year. The health and conduct of the pupils is excellent.\n\nHoping for an early authorization,\n\nI am Dear Sir\n\nYours Respectfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The cost of the labour and the material required in repairing the fences and in the purchase of new belts for the laundry machinery will, therefore, have to be provided from the per capita earnings or other receipts of the school, if necessary to incur the above expenditures at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We can get along, in a way without the seats but the other things are absolutely necessary.\n\nThe furnace must have a pipe.\n\nElectrical switches and wiring must be made safe.\n\nThe two Junior Rooms must be properly screened. Flies coming from outside toilets and stables are a menace.\n\nThe Farm House must have certain repairs to make it habitable, and lumber is absolutely necessary for repairs to steps, pupils' boxes, farm and stable doors etc., so there you are.\n\nWe are only asking \u00a325.00 which in a school of this size is a mere bagatelle, less than is often spent on a little Day School on a Reserve.\n\nWe are economizing in every way consistent with efficiency. Our farming and live stock operations, once a source of revenue, are at present a bill of expense.\n\nOur per capita grant is low compared with some other schools, and our Mission Board is as hard up as the Government, so I think our plan must be as follows.\n\n1. The school will function as economically as possible.\n\n2. In the event of a deficit in our current account we must look to the Mission Board for help; it is part of their contract.\n\n3. In the matter of keeping buildings safe and sanitary we must look to the Department at least for the necessary material which is but a small part of the cost. We are undertaking to do even electrical repairs\u2014a dollar per hour job if a city man were brought out here for the work.\n\n4. Help us all you can\u2014we will do the best we can. Send blackboard as soon as possible\u2014we want to get it in position right away.\n\nI am Dear Sir\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nS. R. Mitty\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The water poured down\nthe walls in torrents soaking them dreadfully. Should this happen in the winter,\nand it certainly will do unless attended to, the frost would undoubtedly chip the\nbricks and cause very serious damage to the building. We are asking several tinsmiths\nto go very carefully over the work and give us prices which we will submit later.\nI hope the price will not be large but it would be sheer folly to allow the brick-\nwork to be damaged by water and frost.\n\nMy assistant, Mr. Strapp, is a very excellent mechanic and he will go very carefully\ninto the matter with the parties tendering and would supervise the work free of cost\nto the Department, which means much.\n\nI am Dear Sir\n\nYours respectfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nSt. Thomas Sheet Metal Works\nG.

McVittie,\nMount Elgin Institute,\nMuncey, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have made an inspection of the inlaid gutters as shown by Mr. Strapp, around the main building of the Institute and find all the gutter in bad shape. The present gutter has had no drip on front and water is running all down the front of the cornice in quite a number of places. The water is coming through the gutter and down in the inside of the cornice and down the brick wall. The only way to make a good job would be to take off 2 courses of slate and put in a new gutter with expansion joints about every 50 ft., then the joints would not keep pulling apart. We have figured on both copper and iron as enclosed tender.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Brownlee are higher; they are however the stronger and better equipped firm and would doubtless do the better job.\n\nThe distance around the building is approximately 435 feet and at $5 per ft. would be about $365.50 Stewart's tender, down pipes would be extra.\n\nBrownlee's tender is $431.00 for the same job but they propose removing three courses of slate in order to make a thorough job; they include down pipe.\n\nBrownlee would also add $24.00 for board of men.\n\nWe respectfully urge immediate action in this matter. It is really pitiable to see the condition of the brickwork after heavy rains. Frost would ruin it.\n\nI am\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOctober 21, 1931.\n\nHonorable:\n\nIt has been found necessary to replace the eavestroughing on the main building at the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School, Hanley, Ont., in the federal district of Middlesex West. The cost will be approximately $425.00. This work will have to be undertaken before heavy frosts, or the upper brickwork will be ruined. The Reverend Principal suggests that the work be given to either J. A. Bromley, of 102 Dundas St., London, or the St. Thomas Sheet Metal Works, of St. Thomas. I may say that St. Thomas and London are the two nearest centres to the school. Will it be satisfactory to engage one of these firms, or should the work be given elsewhere?

Both failed us a few days ago. We had the manufacturers, The Empire Brass Co., send out a man; he found the motor quite used up and the pump needing certain repairs. We could not possibly get along without the water supply, so had a new motor installed and the pump repaired. The total cost will approximate $60.00. We would appreciate authorization of this very necessary expenditure.\n\nThe grates in the small hot water boiler that heats our Annex building need to be replaced before we can put on a fire, and as the cold weather is almost with us and our two junior class rooms are situated in that building we would appreciate an early authorization for this repair also.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, October 21, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, relative to the need of a new motor and pump for use in connection with the water supply system at the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School. It is noted that, upon examination of the former equipment, it was found necessary to have a new motor installed and the pump repaired, at a cost of approximately $60. You may forward a certified voucher, in triplicate, covering the expenditure incurred for this purpose.\n\nYou may also arrange to have new grates installed in the small hot water boiler which heats the annex building. The cost for this purpose should be kept as low as possible, and you should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

If possible, purchase should be made from a firm on the list to receive consideration. Please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the materials. This account, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.

Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nRe: Repairs and Improvements -\nMount Elgin Residential School.\n\nI have just returned from spending twenty-four hours at\nMount Elgin. For the first time I have gone carefully over the whole plant\nand its equipment and am sending this letter to you - not because I wish\nan immediate answer - but because I want you to have time to think over\nthe problem before I come to Ottawa on the 21st.\n\nThis is the third visit which I have made within six or\nseven months, and I am taking the liberty of outlining two programmes.\nThe first contains what would be necessary in order to make the plant and\nequipment worthy of the Government and the Church; the other, the barest\nminimum of improvements which must be undertaken within the next year if\nwe are to carry on at all.\n\nIdeally, then, the following things should be undertaken:\n\n1st.- An extension to the present dining-room and assem-\nbly room of about 20 feet. Under existing conditions, 150 children are\nbeing fed in a basement dining-room which is hopelessly inadequate. Apart\nfrom the hygienic reasons which indicate larger space, the present fearful\nover-crowding makes any kind of training in table deportment absolutely\nimpossible. The assembly room, which is immediately above the dining-room,\nand which was originally a class-room, is so small that it is practically\nimpossible to crowd the staff and the student body into it.\n\n2nd.- The annex should be torn down, or failing that, com-\npletely rebuilt. My personal impression is that the foundation is slipping\nand that an attempt to remodel the present building would be a very diffi-\ncult proposition - if not utterly impossible.\n\nThe little children, who are now climbing rickety outside\nstairs to their class-rooms, should be provided for in class-rooms on the\nground floor of the new building, and the senior class, which now meets in\nthe main building, should also be provided for there. That would release\nthe present senior class-room for a boys' reading and recreation room -\nsomething which is very badly needed.\n\nUpstairs there should be a gymnasium. This could also be\nused as an assembly room when the students put on plays and demonstrations\nto which their parents are invited.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6207, file 408-5, part 6)\nMr. J. D. Sutherland:\n\nThe basement of the new building should be a modern root cellar for the storage of vegetables.\n\n3rd.\u2014 A new cottage for the herdsmen.\u2014 This would provide the farmer, the engineer and the herdsmen with homes a little off the school campus, as there are already two houses.\n\n4th.\u2014 A small annex at each end of the building, running up the three floors, containing bathing and toilet facilities.\n\n5th.\u2014 A new laundry.\n\nIf these changes were made, Mount Elgin would begin to approximate the type of building which is to be found at Brandon, Edmonton and Coqualeetsa.\n\nThe minimum repairs which must be attended to immediately are as follows:\n\n1st.\u2014 A new septic tank.\u2014 No change has been made in this equipment since the original building was erected so far as I can find out. The water from the roof drains into it. The water from the sinks in the kitchen also drains into it. In a time of severe rains, the sewage backs up into both the boys' and the girls' playrooms and flushes through so rapidly that the proper bacteriological action is impossible, polluting the river which runs at the back of the school.\n\nThe drainage pipes have not been changed since 1895 and are so corroded that they are almost useless. Most of the tile in the drains outside is not modern and they are not cemented together.\n\n2nd.\u2014 If the annex, containing bathing and toilet facilities, is beyond the realm of possibility, then there should be added immediately, in addition to the new drainage pipes, two stands and two toilets in each of the boys' dormitories, and at least five more toilets in the girls' dormitories.\n\n3rd.\u2014 The washrooms on the ground floor need to be entirely rebuilt.\n\n4th.\u2014 The only supply of hot water in the main building at the present time comes from a tank which is very little larger than the one which is installed in an ordinary eight-roomed house in this city and is heated by a small jacket heater which would be adequate for a family. A new tank and a new jacket heater, similar to the ones in Brandon and Coqualeetsa, should be installed in the engine-room, so that all the fires will be in the same place and outside of the main building.\n\n5th.\u2014 The laundry should be rebuilt. It may be that an expert would agree that the old walls and roof are usable. If so, new floors and steel joists are certainly indicated. The present joists are so rotten that one can pick them to pieces with his hands, and we are lucky that the tre-\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\n\nmendons weight of the cement floor, which for some unknown reason was put down on the top of the original board floor, and the laundry machinery have not broken through into the cellar, precipitating pupils into scalding steam.\n\n6th.\u2014 An annex to the laundry should be erected, with dressing-rooms upstairs and bathrooms downstairs.\n\nNew laundry tubs, in place of the old insanitary wooden ones which are now in the laundry, should be installed.\n\n7th.\u2014 An automatic stoker and fan should be attached to the boiler which heats the main building. On Tuesday last, in every one of the class-rooms the teachers were using stoves. On the North side of the buildings particularly, this was necessary in order to keep the radiators from freezing. I think the radiation is insufficient\u2014at least on the first two floors\u2014but it might be that with the stoker and fan which I have just mentioned, a sufficiently uniform temperature could be maintained so as to obviate the use of stoves throughout the building. The cost of such an improvement in the furnace-room would be readily offset by the decreased fire hazard.\n\n8th.\u2014 An adequate refrigerator of the walk-in type is very necessary and would add greatly\u2014not only to the quality of the food supplied to the pupils\u2014but to the efficiency of the kitchen staff.\n\nThere are many other small repairs and improvements necessary which can be cared for in the next fiscal year out of school revenue and need not be detailed here.\n\nDr. McLeod, the Department Health Officer at Lancey, was present the other day and we spent three or four hours discussing the situation. I have no doubt that he will be making a report to Dr. Stone in regard to the whole matter.\n\nI wish it were possible for the Department to have someone from your Architect's Office visit Lancey before February 21st. Before anything is done I think we ought to have expert advice. We are fortunate in the fact that Mr. Strapp is an experienced mechanic who understands a good deal about the problems involved in building and equipping a school of this type. Any improvements which are to be undertaken can be carried out without expense so far as supervision is concerned. It is possible that a considerable part of the work can be done by the school staff.\n\nI have dealt in this letter only with the complaints which Miss Webster made about the building and equipment. The questions which arise in connection with the programme of work and study and play need not be discussed by correspondence. In fact, I would not have written this letter were I not anxious that you should get from some other source at your command an accurate estimate of what is needed, and the possible cost. I am willing to send our Board architect to Lancey to go over the place, but I do not think...\nMr. J. D. Sutherland:\n\nthat is the wise thing to do, as the Department would want advice from its own officers anyway.\n\nTrusting that we may have a good deal of time to talk over this intricate problem soon,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB:MLT:NEF\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOFFICE OF\nINDIAN AGENT\n\nFebruary 7th, 1934.\n\nA.T. TAYLOR,\nChief Agent,\nCowichan, B.C.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nIn reply to your request to submit report on the condition of the school at Cowichan Bay, I may say that I have visited the school recently and have reviewed and inspected conditions at the school, and wish to submit the following report and recommendations:\n\n1. Septic Tank: The present septic tank is inadequate for the needs of the school. Raw sewage from the roof drain flows into the tank and is not properly treated and allows raw sewage to enter the boy's playroom. The flood waters passing directly through the septic tank flush the raw sewage therefrom and carry it openly to the river polluting this stream. In addition, sink drainage goes to this tank and interferes with proper bacterial action.\n\nA new septic tank is necessary with systems capable of collecting and treating water from roofs which is desired for the laundry and bath. The new septic tank is also necessary if any other facilities are installed.\n\n2. Bathrooms: Toilets are required for each of the two boys dormitories (4 toilets) and 4 toilets in the girls dormitory and three flush toilets in the upper female dormitory. The present facilities are quite unsatisfactory and the conditions are so bad that they should be entirely replaced. In view of the weather conditions and possibility of an inspection of the new system, the present vault type are most undesirable and prone to failure.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6207, file 468-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n3. Bathing Accommodation\u2014A unit of ten modern baths is required for use of the pupils. If a new laundry were built these could be housed in the same structure. Present bathing facilities are inadequate. Bath bowls are also required in the boys' and girls' playrooms, and the cut-down type would be the most economical. These would serve the children prior to erecting their halls.\n\n4. Laundry Building\u2014During my visit of inspection the principal mentioned an addition to the present laundry building. The roof of this building, which is really several feet above the floor, is made of corrugated iron as heavy as ever, is of brick over which concrete has been mixed. In the rear of this is a raised platform used as a storage place for water and a number of other things. The condition of the walls is very poor, due to vibration, caused in part by the persons working thereon and in part by the fact that the air is so dense inside the building. This is not a healthy habit, and I believe it should be remedied. As I said, I am not sure of this from all angles, and I believe aware of the worst needs of this situation. It might be feasible to renew this roof, but I am of the opinion that a second story is indicated in view of the fact that but little provision can be provided in the present structure. If such a change is to occur the question of heating the laundry is an important one, and should be considered at this juncture.\n\n5. Estimate\u2014As shown by table 1 the capital expenditure is $7,968.00, or $1,000.00 less than the original estimate. A large saving was realized, and I feel certain that we are justified in making this reduction.\n\nAs for our estimate of the cost of materials I am unable to assist as I feel that the figures for experts. I would say, if any one got that a good expert or contractor would be able to assist me. I believe that the item here will be accurate to within five dollars for materials. The total amount of work is estimated at $1,111.00 in the present state of affairs. If this item is with a guarantee to improve the school house, I do not think it is worth while to let it go. I have had the privilege of reviewing the plans and studies of the present school building at Kawa Point, and I feel that the cost of a similar size will be considerably lower.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6207, file 468-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nCANADA\n\nApril 9, 1934.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDoctor McGill,\n\nI beg to report that on April 4th I made an inspection of the Mount Elgin Institute at Muncey, and I am now preparing a report covering this inspection. In the meantime, however, owing to the urgency of the situation I think it advisable to give you particulars about the laundry building.\n\nThis building was erected by the Church authorities some forty years ago. It is a solid brick building, approximately 40 x 26, consisting of basement, ground and first floor. The portion used for a laundry is the ground floor. This floor is constructed with wood joists and a wooden floor, and some time during the past years a concrete floor was laid over the top of the wooden floor. All the laundry machinery, which consists of two large washers, an extractor, and two flat work ironers, are located on this floor. There is also on the ground floor a high pressure steam boiler for supplying steam to the washers and ironers, and a gas engine used as power for operating the laundry machinery. On this floor also are located old wooden laundry tubs, which are not used for laundry purposes but for bathing the pupils.\n\nThe joints supporting the ground floor are badly rotted where they rest on their supports, and there is great danger that the floor will collapse at any time, as it is not strong enough to carry the laundry machinery, especially during the time they are operating the laundry machinery which sets up a very strong vibration.\n\nThe ironers and washers are supplied with steam at high pressure from the steam boiler, and in the case of the floor collapsing the building would be filled with steam. I would strongly recommend that arrangements be made immediately to put this building in proper shape for laundry purposes, and that the present ground floor be taken out, the basement which is not used be filled in and a new concrete floor installed.\nDoctor McGill,\n\nThe interior would require to have the walls plastered and a motor driven fan installed for ventilation.\n\nIt would also be necessary to install a drying tumbler and three new laundry tubs to take the place of the old battery of fifteen wooden tubs.\n\nThe Principal has offered to do as much of the work as possible with his Staff, providing the department will supply the material and one or two expert mechanics. The estimated cost of the changes above mentioned would be approximately $1,800.00.\n\nI may say that if these changes are not carried out immediately it will be necessary to instruct the School to close the laundry as there is great danger of loss of life if operated under present conditions.\n\nWhen the old laundry tubs, which are the only means at present for the bathing of the children, are removed provision will have to be made in the main building for these facilities, and I will include this in my general report on the building.\n\nARCHITECT.\nApril 13, 1924.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDoctor McGill,\n\nI beg to report that in accordance with your instructions I made an inspection of the Mount Elgin Institute at Nansoy on Wednesday, April 4th.\n\nThe Mount Elgin Institute was founded by the Methodist Church in 1861. The original building was erected in this year and enlarged in 1868. A new wing was added in 1875, and in 1912 an addition 40 feet long was added to each end of the building. Since 1912 practically no improvements have been carried out to the main building with the exception of some minor repairs and alterations to that portion of the building occupied by the Principal and the Staff.\n\nIn a letter received from the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada they outlined a list of improvements, which in their opinion, should be undertaken. These are as follows:\n\n1. An extension to the present pupils' dining room and the assembly hall which is located above the dining room.\n2. The annex, which is part of the original school erected in 1861, be either torn down or rebuilt.\n3. A new cottage for the headmaster.\n4. An addition on each end of the building running up three floors to contain bathing and toilet facilities.\n5. A new laundry building.\n6. A new septic tank.\n7. The installing of the necessary equipment to provide for an adequate supply of hot water.\n8. An automatic stoker for the boiler.\n9. A suitable cold storage room in the basement.\n\nWhen making my inspection of the building I paid particular attention to the above requests, and I would respectfully submit the following recommendations:\n\n1. I do not consider it necessary to provide an extension to the building in order to increase the accommodation in the dining room and assembly hall. This extra accommodation can be provided in the building, if a rearrangement is made of the rooms on the basement, ground floor, and first floor. At the present time there is entirely too much space occupied by staff rooms. This space can be considerably reduced to provide the additional space needed for the pupils. As an example of the excessive space occupied by the Staff I may say that the Reverend Principal has a sitting room 15 x 15 - a parlour 10 x 15 - a private dining room 20 x 15 - four bedrooms 14 x 15, and there is also a staff dining room 20 x 15 and a kitchen 20 x 15.\nThis accommodation is far in excess of what is required and provided for in our newer Residential Schools. To my mind it is not necessary or advisable that the Staff dining rooms be supplied from a separate kitchen. There is no reason why all the cooking for the Institute should not be done in the same kitchen as this system is followed with success in our other Residential Schools.\n\n2. With reference to the annex this building is in a fair state of repair, with the exception of the South wall. This wall has settled considerably, and it will be necessary to have it shored up and a new foundation provided.\n\nThe annex is used to provide accommodation for two married members of the Staff and two classrooms. The present layout of rooms is far from satisfactory, as the classrooms are located on the first floor and the living quarters of the annex is by an outside stairway and drain leading from the ground. One classroom is at one end of the building and the other at the other. I would recommend that the rooms be re-arranged to provide both classrooms at one end of the building, and an inside staircase built to provide access to the classrooms.\n\n3. With reference to the request for a cottage for the herdsman, there is a cottage on the property at the present time, which could be used for this purpose, but it is occupied by Mr. Caple who vacated his house in the village for the use of the Doctor. Since a Doctor's residence is built at Runcy Mr. Caple will move into his own house and the cottage will then be available for the herdsman. I may say that the above arrangement was the best that could be made to provide living quarters for the Doctor. There are no other houses available in Runcy.\n\n4. With reference to the addition for toilets, etc., I consider that there is ample space in the building to provide for toilet and bathing facilities. At the present time the school is deficient in sanitary appliances in every department except the portion occupied by the Staff. There are no tub baths in the school for the bathing of the pupils, and at present they are bathed once a week in the old wooden laundry tub in the laundry.\n\nThe only closets available to the pupils in the school are night toilets located in the dormitories. During the day it is necessary for them to use outside closets which are located a considerable distance from the school, and at present are in a very unsanitary condition.\n\nThere is ample space in the rooms adjoining the recreation rooms on the Boys' and Girls' sides of the building in which to install proper sanitary conveniences, and I would recommend that these rooms be fitted up with tub baths, shower baths and closets.\n\n5. A new laundry building is not necessary. I have already submitted to you a report and recommendations with regard to the old laundry.\n\n6. A new septic tank and drainage system does not appear of any great urgency at the present time. The only trouble experienced with the working of the system is during high water in the spring and heavy rains in the summer. It would appear that the drain pipe leading from the septic tank is not large enough. The only way to\nascertain the condition of the present tank and drainage system would be to have the same uncovered for inspection.\n\n7. Regarding the installation of a hot water system it will be necessary to provide an adequate supply of hot water when the heating facilities have been provided. I would recommend that a thousand gallon tank be installed together with a jacket heater. The most efficient and satisfactory way to operate the jacket heater would be to provide a blower with automatic control.\n\n8. An automatic stoker for the boiler would no doubt be of great assistance to the school in operating their heating system. The installation however is rather expensive and I do not think that it should be considered at the present time. Now that electric power is available at the school it would be more desirable to install in place of the gravity furnace to the boiler a receiving tank and pump. This would provide for the circulation of the hot water throughout the building, and would make it much easier to heat the rooms that are located at the greatest distance from the boiler room.\n\n9. A cold storage room is needed. This is being provided for in all our new Residential Schools, and it is practically impossible to keep the school supplies of food in proper condition without it.\n\nI would recommend that proper bathing and toilet facilities for the pupils be provided, including the installation of a new hot water system. Also as recommended in my memorandum of the 4th instant that the necessary repairs be made to the laundry building. These two items to my mind are the most important and urgent at the present time. The estimated cost of providing the baths, closets and hot water system would be approximately $2,000, and as before mentioned in my memorandum of the 4th the cost of the repairs to the laundry would be approximately $1,500, making a total of $3,500. It will be necessary this year to provide a new foundation for the south end of the annex. This will cost approximately $200.00 and if possible the interior should be rearranged as outlined, which would cost approximately $500.00.\n\nThe Reverend Principal has offered to do as much of the work as possible with the members of the Staff provided the department will pay for the materials and any expert labour required.\n\nWith reference to the rearrangement of the rooms to provide additional accommodation for the pupils' dining room, cold storage room, etc., it will be necessary to propose a plan of the basement, ground floor and second floors of the building so that such rearrangements could be made of the rooms to take the best advantage of the space available. I may say that at present the kitchen is very poorly located, with practically no light or ventilation, and it will have to be placed in some other portion of the building. I might also mention that the building is so badly out of shape that there are six different flights of stairs leading from the ground floor, whereas under proper planning two only would be required.\n\nIt will cost approximately $20,000 to put this building in proper shape to provide accommodation similar to that in our new Residential Schools. It will not be necessary to make any additions to the present building, but a rearrangement of the interior. If funds...\ncan be provided this year for the laundry and sanitary conveniences, as above mentioned, next year it might be possible to make a start on rearranging the rooms. This work could be spread over several years, but in the interests of economy and satisfactory results a definite plan must be decided upon before any alterations are undertaken.\n\nARCHITECT\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nApril 11, 1954.\n\nMemorandum:\nDoctor McGill,\n\nI beg to report that in accordance with your instructions I made an inspection of the Mount Elgin Institute at Incey on Wednesday, April 4th.\n\nThe Mount Elgin Institute was founded by the Methodist Church in 1861. The original building consisting of this portion erected in 1866. A second building was erected in 1896, and in 1912 an addition 40 feet long was added to each end of the building. Since 1912 practically no improvements have been carried out to the main building with the exception of some minor repairs and alterations to that portion of the building occupied by the Principal and the Staff.\n\nIn a letter received from the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada they outlined a list of improvements, which in their opinion, should be undertaken. These are as follows:\n\n1. An extension to the present pupils' dining room and the assembly hall which is located above the dining room.\n2. The annex, which is part of the original school erected in 1861, be either torn down or rebuilt.\n3. A new cottage for the headmaster.\n4. An addition on each end of the building running up three floors to contain bathing and toilet facilities.\n5. A new laundry building.\n6. A new septic tank.\n7. The installing of the necessary equipment to provide for an adequate supply of hot water.\n8. An automatic stoker for the boiler.\n9. A suitable cold storage room in the basement.\n\nWhen making my inspection of the building I paid particular attention to the above requests, and I would respectfully submit the following recommendations.\n\n1. I do not consider it necessary to provide an extension to the building in order to increase the accommodation in the dining room and assembly hall. This extra accommodation can be provided in the buildings if a rearrangement is made of the rooms on the basement, ground and first floors. At the present time there is apparently too much space occupied by staff rooms. This space can be considerably reduced to provide the additional space needed for the pupils. As an example of the excessive space occupied by the Staff I may say that the Reverend Principal has a sitting room 15 x 15 - a parlour 18 x 15 - a private dining room 20 x 15 - four bedrooms 14 x 15, and there is also a staff dining room 20 x 15 and a kitchen 20 x 15.\nThis accommodation is far in excess of what is required and provided for in our newer Residential Schools. To my mind it is not necessary or advisable that the Staff dining rooms be supplied from a separate kitchen. There is no reason why all the cooking for the Institute should not be done in one kitchen, as this system is followed with success in our other Residential Schools.\n\n2. With reference to the annex, this building is in a fair state of repair, with the exception of the South wall. This wall has settled considerably, and it will be necessary to have it shored up and a new foundation provided.\n\nThe annex is used to provide accommodation for two married members of the Staff and two classrooms. The present layout of rooms is far from satisfactory, as the classrooms are located on the first floor and the only means of access is by an outside wooden stairs leading from the ground. One classroom is at one end of the building and the other at the other. I would recommend that the rooms be rearranged to provide both classrooms at one end of the building, and an inside staircase built to provide access to the classrooms.\n\n3. With reference to the request for a cottage for the herdsman, there is a cottage on the property at the present time, which could be used for this purpose, but it is occupied by Mr. Capio who vacated his house in the village for the use of the Doctor. When a Doctor's residence is built in Muncey, Ontario, it will serve in his place, and the cottage will then be available for the herdsman. I may say that the above arrangement was the best that could be made to provide living quarters for the Doctor. There are no other houses available in Muncey.\n\n4. With reference to the addition for toilets, etc., I consider that there is ample space in the building to provide for toilet and bathing facilities. At the present time the school is deficient in sanitary appliances in every department except the portion occupied by the Staff; there are no tub baths in the school for the bathing of the pupils, and at present they are bathed once a week in the old wooden laundry tubs in the laundry.\n\nThe only closets available to the pupils in the school are night toilets located in the dormitories. During the day it is necessary for them to use outside closets which are located a considerable distance from the school, and at present are in a very unsanitary condition.\n\nThere is ample space in the rooms adjoining the recreation rooms on the Boys' and Girls' sides of the building in which to install proper sanitary conveniences, and I would recommend that these rooms be fitted up with tub baths, shower baths and closets.\n\n5.

The most economical and satisfactory way to operate the jacket heater would be to provide a blower with automatic control.\n\n8.

The installation however is rather expensive and I do not think it would be considered at the present time. Now that electric power is available at the school it would be more desirable to install in place of the gravity returns to the boiler a receiving tank and pump. This would provide for more rapid circulation of the steam in the building, and would make it much easier to heat the rooms that are located at the greatest distance from the boiler room.\n\n9. A cold storage room is needed. This is being provided for in all our new Residential Schools, and it is practically impossible to keep the school supplies of food in proper condition without it.\n\nI would recommend that proper bathing and toilet facilities for the pupils be provided, including the installation of a new hot water system, also as recommended in my memorandum to you of the 9th instant that the necessary repairs be made to the laundry building.

I may say that the present kitchens in the building lack ventilation and practically no lime or ventilation, and it will have to be placed in some other portion of the building. I might also mention that the building is so badly cut up that there are six different flights of stairs leading from the ground floor, whereas under proper planning two only would be required.\n\nIt will cost approximately $20,000 to put this building in proper shape to provide accommodation similar to that in our new Residential Schools.

Guerney Orr, Archt.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nRegarding your request of the 23rd to have one of our Company go to the Mount Elgin Institute, Muncey, to check over the Laundry Equipment there, we are pleased to advise that the writer had the pleasure of personally taking care of this matter and on May 30th, in the afternoon, met the Institute Superintendent, Rev. Mr. Stroppe, at London and he very kindly drove me to Muncey and under his direction with a crew of men we immediately got busy in bringing the machinery from the outside of the building and lining it up in its proper position in the laundry room.\n\nCommencing with the power pump which was set in the corner near the woodshed, we followed this machine with the extractor, then the Toronto metal washer and finally the Canadian Laundry Machinery wood washer, allowing sufficient room for working space and piping, etc., that is connected to the machine.\n\nThere was provided space sufficient to take care of the wood tubs which would follow the washer line and placed in close proximity to the boiler room door leading from the laundry.\n\nThe engine was placed on the foundations provided for it and after this we followed up the placing of the 66\" #6111 Steam Heated Flatwork Ironer, Canadian Laundry Machinery make, in a line with the pipe columns in the center of the laundry room and followed this up by the placing of the 75\" Tierney Type, Flatwork Ironer, of the York Manufacturing Company.\n\nWe then sized up the pulleys to get the correct drive and speed and it will be necessary to provide a new small wooden pulley for the Canadian Flatwork Ironer.\n\nThe machinery as positioned leaves good room and working space for the contemplated new drying tumbler which will set at right angles to the washer and extractor line back up against the wall at the woodshed partition and the exhaust from this machine can be piped into the woodshed, or if desired, to the chimney connection in the wall. Personally, I believe piping it to the woodshed will be much more satisfactory as there will be less flue connections for the fans to work against but in either case would recommend a\nturnkey in the exhaust pipe so that it can be closed in the wintertime so that\nthe cold air cannot get down to the coils and freeze up same.\n\nThe layout of the machinery lends itself to efficient operation. The soiled\nlinen can come into the laundry and be placed in the corner by the stairway,\nfrom which the person operating the washers can obtain a supply of soiled\nlinen to wash. It will then follow in the natural sequence from the washer\nto the extractor, from the extractor to the drying tumbler, where it will be\nshaken out, if the articles are needed, to be fully dried, and those to be\nironed partially dried, and from this machine on through the flatwork ironer,\nthen folded and placed on the tables which would be provided along the wall\nat the delivery side of the flatwork ironers.\n\nRev. Mr. Stroppe and myself afterwards went over the entire laundry equipment\nfor the purpose of determining what repairs would be necessary.\n\nThe washers are in good working condition. There is a slight movement in the\nbore of the loose pulleys but not sufficient to warrant rebushing. The balance\nof the machines seem to be in serviceable working order.\n\nThe extractor appears to be in good shape with one exception, that the small\nbracket which supports the spring and rod which keeps the brake away from the\npulley is broken and should be welded. Otherwise the machine is in good work-\ning order.\n\nThe Canadian flatwork ironer we checked over and found correct with the excep-\ntion of the cast iron rod which supports the weight that functions with the\nautomatic stop is broken. This can be welded and should be before the machine\nis put into operation. Otherwise, the automatic stop is not kept in its\ncorrect position to function properly if needed.\n\nThe York flatwork ironer of Tierney type is terribly old but shows care and in-\ngenuity on the part of those that have cared and maintained the machine at\nthe Institute and have kept it running. The stuffing box gland and nut at the\npoint of steam entry is showing excessive wear on the thread of the bronze nut.\nWe believe in a short time it will be necessary for you to have a new one made\nlocally at London, where the present nut can be used as a pattern and new\nthread cut of the same thread per inch but several thousandths smaller as there\nis some wear on the cast iron gland that this nut fits on. Considerable dif-\nficulty is experienced in keeping this steam tight and if you have this nut\nmade probably the Empire Brass Company of London, Ontario, could do this work\nfor you very conveniently.\n\nOne of the pinions on the roll of this machine has badly worn teeth and two\nof the teeth are only existing in part and we consider it necessary to replace\nthose that are broken off by small metal studs that could be drilled and tapped\ninto the cast iron pinion and this would enable the machine to function in a\nmore efficient condition than it is at present as it is quite possible that\nthe balance of the teeth will break off at any time unless the above remedy\nis applied. Otherwise the machine is in working order and we must say that\nthe safety features that have been applied by the Rev. Mr. Stroppe are extreme-\nly well applied and guarantee a considerable measure of safety to the operators.\n\nThat about completes the list of repairs necessary as far as we could determine\nand as they are of a nature that can be handled locally we hesitate to suggest\nsending a mechanic from Toronto and incurring such expense to you. This I\nfully believe, Rev. Mr. Stroppe agrees with as with the above repairs taken\nMr. R. Guernsey Orr,\n\ncare of your machinery would be in good working order.\n\nWe would like to suggest that you provide steam traps on both flatwork ironers and also the new drying tumbler which you contemplate purchasing. These will provide proper temperature in the machines and maintain it more consistently than with valves, even though you have no means at present of returning this waste condensation to the boiler.\n\nWe believe this is about the sum total of the report that we can make to you and want to assure you it has been a pleasure of having been of service to you, your Department and to the Institute. Very glad also to inform you that this service is no charge and we want to take this opportunity of thanking, through you, Rev. Mr. Stroppe who so kindly met me at London and drove me to the Institute and back.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Canadian Laundry Machinery Co., Limited.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSales Manager\n\nSOD/M.\n\ncc-SOD\n\nRev.

It will take all available funds now appropriated to complete the new class-rooms and living quarters without touching the existing class-rooms or the new bathing facilities in the old building. In fact I question if the funds still available will be enough to do that, as in remodeling many difficulties are encountered that are not at first known or when the work is completed.\n\nThe advance asked for should be sent forward as soon as possible.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind.

The Department has incurred expenditures this past summer in carrying out repairs and alterations to the main building and in providing laundry machinery to the amount of approximately $6,000.\n\nThe local Indian Agent reports that there are a number of the slate shingles on the roof either broken or missing and that the roof is lacking in several places. He estimates that it would require 400 slate shingles at $0.75 each to make the repairs required. He states that if the slate shingles are furnished, the school authorities would perform the labour, without cost to the Department.\n\nI should be pleased to have the name of your correspondent, in order that he can be given an opportunity to quote on the supplying of the slate required, or the names of any other parties from whom quotations should be received. I may add that there are no funds specially provided for this purpose in our Appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs.

STRAPP, PRINCIPAL\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nNovember 20th, 1934,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to respectfully draw your attention to a matter that, with the onset of cold weather, daily becomes more acute, namely, provision of hot water for the pupils' wash rooms. At the present time we have a small jacket heater with a storage tank of approximately 90 gallons capacity. This of course would provide plenty of hot water for perhaps fifteen persons but is hopelessly inadequate for one hundred and fifty.\n\nDuring the last few months I have made a careful study of various systems of heating water for domestic use and have arrived at the conclusion that for our purpose a 'Flueless Upright Boiler' similar to the enclosed cut and specifications would prove to be the most satisfactory. This boiler could be installed in our present boiler room and connected with the supply lines with very little trouble. Not only would this supply sufficient hot water for the wash rooms but it would also be possible to set up the baths in the Main Building instead of using the Laundry Building, which under present conditions we are forced to do.\n\nIt will be noted that the price quoted is F.O.B.

I also think that they could do with a little more soup made from fresh meats and also have meat a little oftener for their dinner meal, as they were having no meat at all for the meal I attended. The Rev. principal stated to me that they receive meat four meals a week.\n\nThe barns at this school need painting badly to preserve them as they are getting badly rusted. This applies to the exterior wood-work of the whole school which needs painting badly. Mr. Strapp claims that at present there is no toilet fit for use in the boys' dormitory and that during the night they must go out. This he claims is caused by the corrosion of the pipes and a complete overhauling of them would have to be done before they could be used, and these repairs should be done at an early date as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6207, File 468-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir;-\n\nI would beg to enclose accounts in favour of Pennington Bros., Parkhill, Ont. for $158.00 and being for repairs made to the roof of the Mount Elgin School, which was authorized by your letter 7-05 of October 24-34.\n\nTo comply with the request in your letter I did obtain tenders from the two parties listed in your letter and which tenders are enclosed and that of Pennington Bros being the lowest was accepted. Believing that the tender of Pennington Bros was a very close estimate of the work needed and not wishing to have a re-action after the work was started I did phone Mr. Pennington to view the work and make sure that he could do a satisfactory job at his price and he sent a man down who did look over the job and was satisfied to do the complete job for $158.00 and I instructed him to go ahead with the work. The work was done during the time I was on vacation and was supervised by the Rev. Principal of the school.\n\nAfter returning from my vacation I did receive the accounts for the work done and was going to forward them to the Department for payment on December 3rd, on which day the Principal of the school phoned me that the roof was again leaking in three places and I held up the accounts and phoned Pennington Bros to this effect and advised them to return and finish the job properly. They did not come and on December 8th I sent them a letter advising them of the leaks. They have this day appeared and claim that they have lost money on the job and it is not their fault that the roof is still leaking and they maintain that they besides other work done have put 550 slates on the roof, which they value at 40\u00a2 a slate and desire an additional $10.00 to make the repairs still needed.\nIn repairing a slate roof it is nearly impossible to give a close estimate of the cost of such repairs and this work far exceeded the tender of Pennington Bros., who are to blame and I even gave them a chance to look over the work the second time before I instructed them to go ahead.\n\nThe Rev. O. B. Strapp informs me that the work that is at present needed to complete the job properly is a part of that which was contracted for and such being the case the firm should complete their work, no matter how much they are going to lose on their tender and which they now estimate as being between $8.00 and $10.00. Mr. Pennington also has informed me that he is taking this matter up with the Department through Mr. Campbell of Garwood and explaining his case. The account goes forward for whatever action the department desires to take.\n\nAs the actual cost for material would not exceed about $4.00 to buy flashing for the three leaks and as the slates are now all in good shape, I would suggest that this sum be authorized and that Mr. Strapp get one of his men at the school to do the work, for the main part of the Pennington estimate is for time from Parkhill to Mimico and labour.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind. Affs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nOttawa, January 6, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, enclosing an account for payment, in favour of Pennington Brothers, to the amount of $168, covering the cost of repairs made to the slate roof of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School. In reply I have to say that payment of this account will be made and a cheque will go forward to the above firm in the course of the next few days.\n\nIt is noted that a few leaks have developed since the work was done and that you requested the above firm to return and properly complete the work, as it is considered to have been part of the contract. However, as the contractors claim they are not responsible for any further work, the Department, in order to have the roof satisfactorily completed, will approve of you arranging for the purchase of material; the cost of which you state will not exceed $4.00, in supplying the flashing for the three leaks. The Principal should have one of the staff do the work, without cost to the Department.

Campbell has been in touch with Mr. J. G. Murphy of the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa. Mr. Murphy asked what we (Penny & Sons) make recommendations through the agent to the Department and asked a copy of our bid. He says this will put the matter under form and a decision can then be reached.\n\nPlease submit our bid to the Department for their decision and hope you can pass on it favourably. We think we put up a good job and lost plenty of money on it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPenny & Sons\n\nRev. W. M. Hamilton\n\nIndian Affairs.

On the same date I did write this firm advising them that I had no instruction that a further payment was to be made on their work done to the roof of this school and that I had sent forward vouchers to cover the amount of their contract price of $168.00 and which the Department had informed me would be paid.\n\nThis day I have received another letter from this firm, in which I enclose for your information and action. This firm accepted a contract for $168.00 and were given a chance to withdraw their tender as was thoroughly explained by me in my letter of December 31st, 1934, and they did not complete a 100% satisfactory job as I reported at that time and did receive your authority to have the staff at the school repair the three small leaks after the Pennington firm had refused to do the same unless paid an additional $10.00.\n\nIn my opinion this firm has received their pay in full for the work they contracted to do and the matter is left for what action the department sees fit to take under the circumstances, and would suggest that such work in future be done by the shin-les and not by contract.\n\nSecretary,\n\nDept. of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, India Agent.\nFebruary 26, 1935.\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nI beg to refer to my memorandum of September 25th, last, and your reply of October 14th, with reference to repairs to the slate roof of the Mount Elgin Indian residential school.\n\nPennington Bros. quoted the lowest price, viz., $168, and were awarded the business. An account was subsequently submitted in their favour and was paid. The Department is now in receipt of a request from Pennington Bros. for payment of an additional $100 for the work they did at the Mount Elgin school.\n\nI am enclosing, for your information, the following:\n\n(a) Copy of Indian Agent's letter dated December 31, 1934,\n(b) Copy of official letter of January 5, 1935,\n(c) Copy of Indian Agent's letter of February 19, 1935,\n(d) Copy of Pennington Bros. letter of February 16, 1935.\n\nYou will note from the Indian Agent's letter of December 31st that Pennington Bros. were given every possible opportunity to estimate the work, and they then submitted an amount for $168, which was paid although the work was not completely satisfactory. Their request for an additional $100 is submitted for your direction.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nFebruary 16, 1935.\n\nThe Honorable the Superintendent General,\n\nI have to refer to my memorandum of September 17th,\nand to your letter of October 28th, with reference to records\nfor the school at the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School.\n\nPennington Bros. submitted lowest price, viz., $100,\nas were quoted by others.

(RG 10, Volume 6207, file 468-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, March 6, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th ultimo, enclosing an account in favour of Pennington Brothers, Parkhill, Ont., in which they request an additional $100.00 for the work and materials supplied by them for the roof of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School.\n\nThe request of the above named firm was submitted to the Honourable the Superintendent General, and he has directed that we obtain an expression of your opinion as to the value of the work done and materials supplied. If you consider that any additional remuneration should be made, I would request that you forward an account, giving full particulars covering any further remuneration you would recommend be paid this firm. Please give this matter your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. MacKensie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncy, Ont.\nSir:-\n\nI would beg to enclose Agent's Report form for the month of March, covering my visit made to the Mount Elgin Residential School on the 14th instant.\n\nThe Reverend Principal of this school again brought to my attention the need of additional fire escapes on the south wing of the school proper, for the safety of the pupils sleeping in the girls dormitory. There is one small escape for the south wing, which would not be sufficient to accommodate all pupils in this wing should an outbreak of fire take place, there being over eighty children in the south wing.\n\nConditions at the Mount Elgin School are in a very satisfactory state, being little sickness, no truancy and the management of the school being under the direction of a young and efficient staff.\n\nSecretary,\n\nA. D. [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6207, file 468-5, part 7)\nKilpatrick Bros., Hardware,\n602 Dundas St.,\nLondon, Ont.\n\nRev. C. B. Strapp,\nPrincipal, Mount Elgin Institute,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed you will find Itemized Prices of the items. I think you will refer this to a bulk price. I have indicated with letter S for Stanley goods, I interviewed Mr. White, Principal of the Technical Manual Training Department. They have been using this same bench I have quoted on, and for saws, he refers the 20\" Saw for boys. He is using the Shurly Dietrich Saw made in Salt. I have noted on a medium sized saw. We could quote on a cheaper size or more expensive. I have quoted on Joe. Howarth's make of chisels for the Plumber Revill Base and Swedish chisels for the socket style - guaranteed lines, especially the Howarth. It is an old English make. The mitre machine is priced without saw. I have added this item at the bottom of Sheet [1]. 26\" Back Saw is the one that is mostly used in this machine or we could quote on 26\". Also the Stanley Iron Planes quoted on with corrugated bottoms come some higher in price to the smooth bottoms planes. The smooth bottoms seem to have the preference over the corrugated bottoms. I have also quoted on the best grade hammer made by Smiths of Broadville. We could also quote on 1 pound Hammer, drop forged heads as low as $50 each, others at $7.50 and $10.00 each. Several items we find have been discontinued. One of them is the 4724 four-fold 2 ft. rule. I have quoted on this in either Lufkin or English make. It is 1 3/8\" wide and brass bound. Also the Selects, Layout Plane, 1200 kind you described to me over the phone - the price was very high and did not give very much encouragement on locating any. If you decided you would prefer this mallet we would try and locate some at a more reasonable price. Sometimes these discontinued lines are jobbed off at low prices.\n\nSet of Genuine Irwin bits from 1/8 to 1\" inclusive. Cost per set $7.60. This bit is a clean borer in either soft or hard wood. I have tried to explain a number of items in these pages, but if any further information is required I could come out and go over the list and make further explanations on same, or if you would care to come in and go through the Tech Manual Training Department. Here I am at your service and I am sure I can say the same for Mr. White.\n\nTrusting that we may hear from you again,\n\nYours truly,\n\nKilpatrick brothers.\n\nCopied - NEF\n## Kilpatrick Bros.

In order to accomplish this purpose, some equipment is necessary and you may authorize the Principal to incur an expenditure not exceeding $275.00 in the purchase of the articles absolutely necessary.\n\nThe Principal is, no doubt, aware what articles are needed. You should allow him to choose what he requires. Quotations should be obtained from Hobbs Hardware Company, Limited, and Kilpatrick Bros.

I would advise that I did write this firm on March 11th asking them for an itemized account of the material and labor they supplied and have just received their account on the 29th of March.\n\nAs previously stated by me I do believe the tender of this firm was low and they did lose money, but they were also given the second opportunity to adjust their tender and were satisfied to let it stand. At the time of looking over the work this firm did inform me that they would put on the slate shingles at 40\u00a2 each if only a few were needed, but if a large quantity were needed they would do the work at 35\u00a2 a shingle laid on.\n\nConcerning the Reverend Principal of the School, Mr. Strapp informs me that no copper for gutters was supplied at all and that they were repaired by coating them with black asphalt paint. Mr. Strapp also states that after they had completed their work there were still three small leaks in the roof and the staff of the school had to complete this work. Taking the whole situation into consideration I would consider this firm would be well paid for their total work at the sum of $213.00 and would recommend accordingly.\n\nIn reaching this figure I would allow payment as follows: 550 slate shingles 11\" x 33\" laid down @ 35\u00a2 each = $192.50; Labour for gutters, etc. @ $1.00; nails, tar, etc. @ $.50; Nails used @ $3.50; Flashing material @ $1.50; making a total of $213.00.\nA consideration also in reaching the figure of $213.00 is the fact that I know of a firm in London that does roof repairing and upon inquiry they informed me that they were prepared to place shingles of this size on a roof at 30\u00a2 a slate and if it was a large job they would consider a price of 25\u00a2 a shingle laid down.\n\nEnclosed please find a voucher in which I have made out for the full amount of $89.00 claimed by Pennington Bros., but which I only recommend payment to the amount of $75.00 to make the total of $213.00 I would allow.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind.

Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJuly 16th,\n1935.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI have no doubt that you will have learned before this that none of the pupils of this School had left when the outbreak of measles, referred to in my recent telegram, occurred. I do not know just why, but this School has for years followed the practice of carrying on until the middle of July and then opening on September 1st. The Principal and his staff had, of course, immediately resorted to a re-arrangement of dormitory space as an emergency measure. It must be quite evident to anyone who knows the building that that inevitably means over-crowding some of the other dormitories in order to provide isolation for the pupils who are ill. In the event of fire or panic through some other cause, the fact that 150 pupils were attempting to use exits intended for 100 might easily result in loss of life or injury to some of the pupils. We feel that by reporting the matter and asking for immediate action, we have cleared ourselves of responsibility.\n\nThe whole situation is exceedingly unfortunate, as it breaks up the arrangements for staff holidays. I hope that long before this Mr. Orr has been able to visit Muncey and make some arrangements for beginning the improvements and alterations. I certainly do not intend the $20,000 in the Estimates for that purpose to be transferred to some other account, if I can help it.\n\nThanking you for your help in this important matter,\n\nI am\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Dr. McGill: I beg to call your attention to the condition of the heating plants at this school.\n\nThe main building is heated by a \"Low Pressure\" boiler but owing to the general condition of the plant and the length of the leads it is not possible to keep the building at an even temperature. Mr. Orr of your department gave a definite promise over a year ago that he would arrange for an expert to make a survey of the plant and have it placed in proper order. NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE. I took the matter up with him on the occasion of his visit a few days ago and pressed for some action. Without doubt, as he admitted, our plant is not at all adequate. There should be two boilers of approximately two thirds the necessary capacity and the main building and the annex should be heated from a central plant. If that is not possible at present owing to the lack of funds for the purpose I beg to make the following recommendations:\n\n1. A competent heating specialist be employed to overhaul the radiator steam traps, leads and insulation, and put same in good repair.\n\n2. That an automatic stoker similar to that in operation at the Mohawk Institute at Brantford be installed.\n\nThe annex building, in which are located classrooms and bedrooms for members of the staff, is heated by a hot water jacket heater. Several of the radiator leads are now overloaded and there is yet another classroom to be heated. We were compelled to put stoves in the classrooms last year as it was not possible to use them at all without. I therefore make the following recommendation:\n\n1. That the cellar be deepened so that the jacket heater may be set lower and permit proper rise for the hot lines to the radiators and fall for the returns.\n\n2. That another heater similar to the present one be installed as an auxiliary to the present one and the load divided.\n\nThe cold weather is rapidly approaching and I am very anxious to have this matter attended to so that the pupils and staff may be at least reasonably comfortable this year.\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Limited,\n404 Plaza Bldg., Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following is a report on the present heating system in the above building. We received a request from Mr. Orr to investigate the cause of trouble with the heating:\n\nPRESENT SYSTEM.\n\nThe present system is a Dunham return heating system with 22 radiators and a No. 11 return trap supplied by a 60\u00b0 x 12'-6\" Leonard downdraft firebox boiler. The system was not operating at the time the writer was on the job. However, the heating must be very unsatisfactory since some of the class rooms had stoves installed in addition to the radiators.\n\nThe Principal, Mr. Strapp informed me that the diaphragms had been removed from a large proportion of the radiator traps and that the steam escaped from the packless radiator valves, also that in cold weather the normal operating pressure was from 10 - 15 pounds. Several of the radiators are reported to be leaking.\n\nThe main piping and risers appear to be in good condition, and generally speaking the job is well installed although there are some locations where the grade could stand some adjustment.\n\nThe class room annex which is located about 30 ft. from the boiler room is heated by a hot water system and according to Mr. Strapp, this is also unsatisfactory, and they require additional stoves in the class rooms to obtain livable temperature conditions.\nThe present domestic hot water heating system is apparently unsatisfactory and should be replaced with more efficient equipment.\n\nCOMMENDATIONS:\n\nThe present heating system is a little too large to operate most efficiently as a gravity system and since the diaphragms in the traps and packless valves are obviously in need of replacement, we recommend that they be replaced with Differential tops and discs, and that a vacuum pump and regulating valves be installed to make a complete Dunham Differential Heating System. The control might be either manual or automatic but we suggest automatic control with the thermostat located in the Principal's apartment.\n\nWe further suggest that the Annex Building be heated from the main building with a new steam heating system, since the present heating system is unsatisfactory and the change would certainly save fuel.\n\nIn our opinion the domestic hot water for the laundry and buildings should be heated from the steam boiler and perhaps most satisfactorily by a heater below the boiler water line.\n\nWe have not been able to check the capacity of the present boiler to adequately handle the proposed load but it does not appear to be a very difficult job to extend the present boiler-room in order to install a stoker fired additional boiler, if necessary.\n\nThe present heating system could be easily arranged for gravity operation in case of interruptions in the supply of electricity to the building.\n\nWe hope this report may be of some assistance to Mr. Orr and we will be glad to cooperate further.\n\nYours very truly,\nC. A. DUNHAM CO., LIMITED\nToronto Branch Sales Office\nP. W. Stott - Sales Mgr.\nOct. 16th, 1935\n\nThe Lt.

These prices are for ranges with cast linings.\nOttawa, October 31, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th instant, enclosing the quotation which the Principal of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School obtained for making repairs to the two ranges in the kitchen of the school.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of the expenditure in having the parts required for the ranges obtained and the repairs carried out. It is noted that the cost will be, approximately, $26.00, for each range. After the parts have been supplied and the ranges placed in good condition, you should obtain an itemised account, in triplicate, covering the cost. This, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, regarding the plumbing and toilet work and the overhauling of the heating system, I have to say that Mr. Orr, the Architect of the Department, is at present absent in the West. Upon his return, this matter will be drawn to his attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncy, Ont.\nNov. 12, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nIt is necessary to make some alterations and improvements to the heating system at the Mount Elgin Institute at Minassy, Ont. Will you kindly give me the names of competent firms of steamfitters in London or St. Thomas from whom prices may be obtained for this work.\n\nThe Mount Elgin Institute is in the electoral district of Middlesex West.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am taking this opportunity of writing you in regards to the Indian Institutions. I am working at Mount Elgin Institute at present, remodeling one of the Class Rooms, and notice there is a lot of work that should be done now before it gets worse, and takes a larger amount of money to repair. I feel sure if the matter was brought to your notice you would agree that if repairs were checked over & the most needed work done at the time it should be, it would save money & time & keep the buildings always in good repair. A good Carpenter could look after 2 or 3 different Institutes. By that I mean spend a month or longer at each one doing what was really necessary, and by that way there...\nwould be no need of spending any great amount of money outside of a few nails and a little lumber each year. As you know if a building is kept in good repair it takes very little, but if it is let go a few years it takes a much larger sum to repair it. If these suggestions are favorable to you & you should decide to give it a trial I would appreciate it. If you would give me a chance to work under your Department I can assure you of good work being done all the time and a big saving to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nAllow me at this time to congratulate you on your appointment as Manager of the Interior and hope your efforts will prove as successful as in the past.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nLloyd George Marshman\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nNovember 18, 1935\n\nI understand that negotiations have been under way in regard to a stoker for the Muncey Institute and that your Department has a proposal from Mr. A. P. McEwen of Ailsa Craig signed by Mr. [signature not legible].\n\nWill you please let me have a report in regard to the matter set forth if it is the intention to place a stoker in the Muncey Institute at the present time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.J. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary\nNovember 21, 1935.\n\nMemorandum Mr. Pratt.\n\nReferring to your inquiry of the 18th with reference to the Stoker for the Mount Elgin Institute at Muncey, Ont., I would say that there are no funds available at the present time to install a stoker in connection with the heating system in this building.\n\nThe Department has not therefore been negotiating with any firm towards this installation.

Kindly furnish an explanation as to the difference in these charges.\n\nIt is also noted that you have charged for the materials used by the plumber, also for the time worked by him, and in addition have added a number of items for profit for this plumber. Besides this you have added your own profit of 10%, on all, except the amount charged for carpenter's wages on which you have charged 6% compensation. The Department is of the opinion that the charges for profits for the plumber are an overcharge, and would like to have your reasons for same.\n\nThe charges for gasoline purchased should be supported by receipts.\n\nThe items which are not in order are marked with an \"X\".\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

To the total cost of material and labor plus overhead I added 10% profit.\n\nThe Compensation rate levied on the Plumbing and Heating Industry is $2.40 per hundred. This was added on as a separate item as it has to be paid to the Government and profit does not permit absorbing it.\n\nThe gasoline charged covers transportation for men and materials to this job and gasoline actually used by workmen in their torches. As this gasoline was purchased at different Service stations as needed I do not have receipts to supply.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJLP: P\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6207, file 468-5, part 7)\nJ.

Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nNo. 705.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of Feb 17; the machining referred to in the putting through the machines of the material necessary for the making of panels, stools, mouldings etc., the other charge listed in account is for the raw material (unfinished), necessary to make panels, stools, mouldings etc. This material is put through the machines as needed and is therefore charged at different times.\n\nThe charges, charge of which appear on Oct 18 and last item on account represent altogether different work. The charge of $6.00 on Oct 18 was for trucking heavy steel beam, which required the\nJ. V. SNIDER\nGENERAL CONTRACTOR\n\n343 Wortley Road\nLondon, Ont.\n\nHeavy truck and extra help in loading and unloading.\n\nIn reference to the plumbers account, I am enclosing the plumbers bill, which I had to pay, also his letter of explanation.\n\nRegards the completion being on Carpentry, it is the amount covered by Ont. Bldg. compensation on all wages. The 10% profit covers overhead expenses\u2014office, telephone, business tax and supervision of all work. The 10% which I added to the plumbing account represents my supervision, which necessitated a number of trips to Surrey. As authorized, this work was mostly done after the other work was completed.

Snider, London, Ont., for materials and labour supplied for work done at Mount Elgin Residential School to the amount of $1,612.93, and beg to call your attention to the items marked \"Profit for plumbing contractor\". Will you kindly explain how this amount is arrived at. In J.L. Paisley's letter dated February 22, 1936, an explanation has been given but this does not work out to the amounts charged. The plumber's profits would appear to be slightly over 20%, he states 10% in his letter.\n\nMr. Snider in his letter states he has paid the plumber, and I wish to point out that the plumber's accounts are not receipted to show what Mr. Snider did pay him. I think we should have definite proof on this point.\n\nAlso, do you consider that J.V.

Hope Indian residential school on the Muncey Reserve. This was the first visit by any grand jury to such institution. This school, but many years ago, closed but reopened in 1867, occupies a tract of land consisting of 200 acres and with a further rental of 50 acres. We were introduced to the principal, Rev. D. B. Strapp, by Dr. J. W. Strapp, resident physician at the Indian agent Mr. A. D. Muncey. This school became a centre for industrial and dairy work. There are 30 girls and 10 boys aged from 11 to 19 years. We credit it to the Federal Government's management as an institution of this nature. We would recommend that the department of Indian affairs at Ottawa be requested to supply this institution with adequate accommodation also an emergency hospital capable of taking care of both sexes, with accommodation for six or eight patients. The heating system is at present inefficient, and could be improved at least 30 per cent in the installation of a vacuum pump or air eliminator on the return line.\"\nApril 27th, 1936\n\nDr. E. L.

At that time we asked for desks but were informed that there were no funds available for the purpose. At that time we were using a number of kitchen chairs and some large double desks and have continued to do so during the past year. It is impossible for the pupils to place their feet on the floor and assume the correct posture with the result that they tire very quickly and the work of the class is more difficult to carry on.\n\nTo properly seat the room, using all the present small single seats we require the following desks, fronts, and backs:\n\n5. Mayer Catalogue page 6.\n\nSix #2 desks. One #6 front. One #6 back.\nTen #4 desks. Three #4 fronts.\nFive #3 fronts.\n\nThe ages in this room will vary from five to fourteen with the majority from five to nine. We propose to seat five across the front with the rows seven seats deep, a total of thirty-five in the room.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs.

In view of the information left in charge of the Deputy Indian Superintendent, we were forced to present a new contract. We are informed that only the material that attired the old work, and therefore sub-\nriting this price we have no fair\nplace guarantee. Other materials\nmay be obtained, but without\nguarantees.\n\nThe find in measuring\nwill not be done in a\nshort work.\n\nApproximately 60 gal. of ben-\nzene.

The\nlast quota has been completed\n$504.00.\n\n6 sq. of metal to be shipped.\nin coal, wholesale cost $6.50 per ton.\n\nOld metal removed from roof and new metal replaced at $10.00 per sq. ft., equals $60.00\n\nCleaning of gutters, approximately 20 sq. ft. per side, equals $20.00\n\nCleaning all metal sheets on all buildings, approximately 100 sq. ft., $100.00 per sq. ft., equals $100.00\n\nSteel brushing all metal, approximately 100 sq. ft., $5.00 per sq. ft., equals $50.00\n\nTotal cost also includes winter conditions. I am not looking to pay for work in July and August until snow only covers.\n\nIf however you wish a new aluminum job, we can arrange a price, but in no case...\nmay recommend the work.\n\nwaiting Yours obediently\n\nJ.

The delay has been caused by the anxiety of the Dennisteel Corporation Ltd., to make sure that the iron beam for which we asked would carry the weight, in place of the pillars which now run, as you will remember, right down through the centre of the room. They have finally concluded that an ordinary trussed floor beam is impracticable, but that an \"I\" beam is strong enough to carry the load and to be perfectly safe.\n\nI am enclosing the rough sketch which Mr. Strapp has made to indicate how the room would be arranged. You will notice that practically all of the expenditure is for equipment which can be transferred to the chapel in a new school when it is erected.\n\nThe items are as follows:\n\n- Supplying and placing in position the \"I\" beam: $65.00\n- 175 seats @ $2.00 each: $350.00\n- 90 hymnbook racks @ 40 cents each: $36.00\n- Pulpit: $45.00\n- Lectern: $60.00 (less 20%)\n- Altar: $60.00\n- Two platform chairs: $20.00\n\n(Sales tax on all of the above extra)\n\n- Electrical fixtures and repairs: $25.00\n- Material for rebuilding platform: $25.00\n- 10 gals. Paint @ $2.70: $27.00\n\nAll the labor, except what is necessary to install the \"I\" beam and the ventilating fans - that is all the unskilled labor - would be supplied by the School, without cost.\n\nFor your information, we are also enclosing clippings from the catalogue of the Valley City Seating Company, indicating the type of fixtures which are included in the estimates above.\n\nI hope it may be possible to authorize this work immediately, so that the School will have the benefit of the chapel during the rest of\nthis term. It would be of great advantage to the Principal and\nthe Matron if the work could be done while the rest of the improve-\nments are being carried out, so that they would have all the work-\nment on the premises at the same time.\n\nI hope arrangements have been made before this to carry\nout the changes in the heating plant which were recommended by the\nexpert who visited the School at your request last year. Even now,\nit is a fairly serious matter to have to let the fires out for any\nlength of time in a place where there are so many little children.\n\nAssuring you that we deeply appreciate your interest\nin this School and your continued co-operation, and with very kind\npersonal regards,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nENBLT\nEncs.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nNov. 3, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nWill you please purchase and have shipped addressed to the Reverend Principal of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School, Muncey, 37 double seats (174 seats) similar to those shown on cut on file, and as manufactured by the Valley City Seating Co., of Dundas.\n\nArchitect for the Department.\nNov. 5, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, addressed to the Architect of the Department, with reference to the improvements to the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School.

The purchase of a new boiler is recommended.\n\nMr. Davis also asked that he receive a advance of $50.00 on the work he has done. If this advance is due to him, such a sum I will be glad to make. We have the work nearly completed and expect that we have got to a large extent for what we have already received.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6207, file 468-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nAttending Mr. Turner Orr.\n\nI am dealing with the paint of the buildings at the present time. To all of his work on a new basis, I find myself that the work is not going ahead with a satisfactory result due to the element weather and thus to the present time four of the buildings have been steel brushed, and two of the roofs have part of their primer coats. This work was done on clear mild days and the completion of the work will depend on weather conditions in future and under these circumstances a satisfactory job cannot be guaranteed.\n\nMr. Turner Orr suggests that if the two large barns can be completed this fall, the balance of the work will till next year and so I am about having them finished off by Christmas. We have had a lot of heavy work on this work and criticize severely the fact that Mr. Orr has not been working on the same as he was last fall, and I have had to do it. The result which is now evident to the layman is I would consider that it will take me half the shortest job possible.\n\nIn conclusion, I would say that if Mr. Turner Orr will complete the two large barns this fall, the result of the work will be more than by relief work by himself. In fact it could by my opinion all have been done in less if the equipment had been available.\n\nI shall await Mr. Orr visit this Agency at an early date and give definite instructions in this regard ascertaining the facts of the situation and a report in the month of January.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind.

Before the remainder can be paid an adjustment in the account is necessary. This is being made and when the account is returned in proper form the balance of approximately $500 will be paid.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.J.F. Pratt\nSecretary.\n\nMiss M.

McGillivray,\nDirector of Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI regret very much the necessity for drawing your attention to the following facts in connection with the plumbing repairs carried out at this school by Mr. Harvey J. Davis of Lambeth, Ont.\n\nMr. Davis submitted his account to Mr. Agent Moore and before sending the account forward for payment Mr. Moore inquired as to whether the work was satisfactory. I refused to accept the work as unsatisfactory and in his covering letter to my R.S.O., Mr. Moore so advised. However, without any investigation whatever the account was passed for payment. I hereby charge that there were items in this account that were not fair and just charges because they were for materials which were not supplied and for work that was not done, also there were items that were grossly overcharged.\n\nI quote the following items as examples:\n\n1. Materials and fittings for stack in girls' dormitory South Wing, $55.00\n2. Repairing stack, girls' dormitory third floor, materials $55.00\n   (In this case $6.00 would cover cost)\n3. Wooden enclosure with necessary door and hardware, $20.00\n   (In this case no material was supplied.)\n4. Labor charges for taking out old and installing new toilet bowl and tank, $60.00 (This item could have been done by our school mechanic in about 6 hrs.)\n\nI have quoted the above items to indicate the serious overcharging in this account which, I believe, amounts to over $400.00 in total. Mr. Davis called at the school one day last week and in the presence of Mr. Moore admitted, and agreed to correct the items which I challenged.\n\nI have hesitated to bring to your attention the very unsatisfactory standard of the work executed, supposedly under the supervision of your architects branch, at this school during the last two years but this constitutes such a glaring example of mal-administration that I feel in duty bound to call it to your attention in order that action may be taken to protect this school against the possibility of a re-occurrence. The amount of this overcharge would go a long way towards the repairs to our heating system or the provision of an infirmary ward, both of which are very much needed at this time.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Paint ceiling and walls. Screen wash basins.\n\nHall to dining-room: Strip plaster from ceiling and replaster. Paint walls.\n\nPupils' bath room: This room was fitted up as an emergency measure when the laundry tubs, in which the pupils had been bathed up until this time, were removed during the remodelling of the laundry building about two years ago. This room was used as a workshop and nothing was done beyond placing eight tub baths along one wall; connecting up the water and drain and changing the name from workshop to bathroom. The present condition is anything but sanitary and because of the location of the room it is impossible to adequately ventilate it without installing a proper exhaust ventilating system. A new floor should be laid so that proper drainage may be obtained, the walls should be resurfaced with a light colored hard wall plaster. The ceiling should be painted and three electric fixtures installed to give adequate lighting.\n\nPupils' kitchen: The wainscoting in this room is in a deplorable condition and should be removed entirely. The plaster on the ceiling is loose in a number of places and should be stripped off and the ceiling re-plastered. The walls should be resurfaced and painted. Two extra lights are needed. Proper cupboard space and utensil racks should be provided. A ventilating canopy should be provided above the stove to prevent cooking odours spreading throughout the building.\n\nPupils' dining room: Strip loose plaster from ceiling and replaster. Paint ceiling and walls, also all woodwork. Remove opaque glass from windows and replace with plain glass.\n\nBoys' recreation & assembly room: During heavy rains the water seeps through the walls with the result that the wainscoting has rotted away. A tile drain should be provided to carry off the seepage. The wainscoting...\nRooms & Halls cont'd -\n\nshould be removed, the walls resurfaced, walls and woodwork painted.\n\nBoys' wash room; Strip off loose plaster, re-surface walls with hard finish, paint walls and woodwork.\n\nMain Floor.\n\nBoys' reading room; Repair plaster, paint walls and woodwork, varnish ceiling, and install one extra lighting fixture.\n\nManual training room; This room is in fair condition.\n\nAssembly room; At present being renovated.\n\nDomestic Science and Staff Kitchen; Repair walls and ceiling, paint woodwork and walls, provide adequate cupboards and utensil racks.\n\nGirls' reading room; Paint walls, ceiling and woodwork. Install one extra lighting fixture.\n\nSewing class-room; Paint walls and varnish ceiling.\n\nFirst Floor.\n\nGirls' dormitory; Repair plaster. Paint woodwork, walls and ceiling. Install exhaust ventilating fans and intake grilles.\n\nBoys' dormitory; Repair plaster, paint woodwork, ceiling and walls. Install exhaust ventilating fans and intake grilles.\n\nSecond Floor.\n\nGirls' dormitory; Repair plaster, paint woodwork, ceiling and walls. Install exhaust ventilating fans and intake grilles.\n\nBoys' dormitory; Repair plaster, paint woodwork, ceiling and walls. Install exhaust ventilating fans and intake grilles.\n\nThird Floor.\n\nCentre room; Strip off plaster from ceiling and replaster. Repair walls and paint woodwork.\n\nNorth rooms; This room is approximately 55 ft. long and 26 ft. wide and at present is not being used. I would suggest that it be fitted up for infirmary accommodation at the present time we have not a room in which we can isolate a sick pupil.\n\nStairways from Basement to Pupils' Dormitories.\n\nAll these stairways are in poor condition with the treads badly worn. All treads should be replaced, plaster repaired, all woodwork and walls painted.\nThis is something that does not at present exist. I would suggest that a modern cold storage room be installed in the vegetable storage room in the basement.\n\nHeating Plant.\n\nThe heating plant consists of one low pressure boiler with steam radiators and gravity return system. It is hopelessly inadequate as at present installed. I would recommend the following alterations:\n\n1. Installation of a small auxiliary boiler. (On two occasions during the last five years boiler tubes have given out and it has been necessary to draw the fires in mid-winter. Imagine 150 people in the school without a fire in the boiler in February.)\n\n2. Installation of an automatic stoker with thermostat and blower fan.\n\n3. Installation of a vacuum return pump to promote proper circulation of steam throughout the system.\n\nMain Building Roof.\n\nThere are approximately 250 broken and cracked slates on the main roof and towers. During heavy rains the water soaks down through until the main roof timbers are beginning to show signs of decay. The whole roof should be carefully inspected and broken slates replaced. The towers while adding to the appearance of the building are really causing much of our trouble as during high winds they sway to such an extent that the building is rocked and it is impossible to prevent the plaster on the walls and ceilings from cracking and falling.\n\nAnnex Building.\n\nIn this building are located the three public school class rooms, the Herdsman's living quarters, the Mechanic's living quarters and three rooms for single members of the staff.\n\nIn 1934-5 considerable work was done with a view to remodelling this building. The south wall was badly bulged and in a dangerous condition; it was pulled down and rebuilt. In 1935 the east wall had to be pulled down and rebuilt and now the north wall is badly cracked and needs attention. At the time that the alterations were made to the Herdsman's and Mechanic's apartments no redecorations were included with the result that they are very much in need of redecorating throughout.\n\nThe senior class room is in good condition but the intermediate and primary rooms have a very patched up appearance and should be completely redecorated.\n\nThe architect of the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Mines and Resources visited this school and made a thorough inspection in 1934. A copy of his report was forwarded to Mr. Beaton's office April 17th, 1934 by Dr. H. W. McGill.\nIn his report the architect, Mr. Orr, proposes to re-plan the various floors of the building to use up waste space. After giving careful study to the plans of the building he is now convinced that re-planning is utterly impossible and impracticable. He insists that the only solution is a new building in the immediate future.\n\nI find myself in complete agreement with Mr. Orr's decision. This school was in the first place planned for about 75 pupils, the dormitory space was extended to provide for 100 to 125. Our present registration is 134 and we are continually receiving applications from the Indian Agents for more admissions. Our pupilage has so far outgrown our physical equipment that we are working all the while at a decided disadvantage.\n\nI sincerely hope that our Home Mission Board will see its way clear to recommend the building of a new fireproof school in the immediate future. The present buildings would burn like tinder if they once caught fire. The strain, upon the staff, of the constant vigilance necessary to prevent fire and the probable loss of life is very heavy. In a new school adequate provision should be made for vocational training in all branches as well as public school work.\n\nShould you deem it desirable, I will be glad to come to Toronto and appear before the Board or any of its committees and answer any questions that may arise and present information that may be desired.\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of my letter to Mr. Hoey, Superintendent of Welfare and Training.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSign'd - Oliver B. Strepp.\nOttawa, March 13, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, you may authorize the Principal of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School to engage the services of a night watchman. He can be employed until such time as it becomes unnecessary to heat the building. Payment for his services will be allowed at the rate of $40.00 a month.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Roy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI am in receipt of a telephone instruction from Mr. Agent Moore to the effect that you have issued authority for the employment of a night watchman for this school until fires in the main heating plant are discontinued. Mr. Moore informs me that he does not know whether this watchman is to be employed by me as a member of the staff of this school and therefore paid through my office or whether he is to be considered as a temporary employee of your department and paid through Mr. Moore's office.\n\nI am sure that you will understand that it is rather difficult for me to know just what your intention is in the matter when all that I have as authority is a telephone communication.\n\nI would very much appreciate direct communication upon all matters affecting the administration of this school, with, whenever necessary, a copy of the letter going to the local office for the information of the Agent. It is very difficult to keep the files of the school in proper order for reference purposes unless correspondence is available for filing.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that in order to make the inspection of the building at regular intervals effective, a watchman's clock should be obtained and keys placed at stations throughout the building.\n\nMay I say that I appreciate very much your decision to employ a watchman as we have been very much concerned about the possibility of fire, as owing to the general construction of the building it would be very difficult to bring a fire under control if it once obtained a good start.\n\nAwaiting your instructions in the matter,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Davis, Lambeth, Ont., for $3,083.94 being for materials and work at the Mount Elgin Residential School, Muncey, as was authorized by your letter 7-0-5 of Sept. 21st, 1936.\n\nThe cost of this work has exceeded the estimate made by Mr. Davis by a considerable amount and also there has been work done that was not shown in the estimate and at the request of the Principal of the school, no authority having been given for additional work from this office.\n\nI did request the Principal of the school to approve of this account, which he refused to do, complaining that Mr. Davis had not completed the work to his satisfaction in so far as the cement work at the toilets is concerned and that there are no covers on the water tanks of the toilets which he claims were to be installed and thereby stop the pupils from throwing articles in the water tanks of the toilets. On taking this matter up with Mr. Davis he informed me that the style of tanks installed are of the open variety and no tops are needed.\n\nBefore payment of this account is made I would suggest that the work be inspected by a departmental official and approved, as this work was all carried out under the supervision of the Principal and on his instructions and this office only gave instructions as to the work stated in the estimate given by Mr. Davis.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind.

If you can do so, we would appreciate your advising us if Mr. Davis' representations to us are correct and the reason for the delay in paying the money over to him.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nManager\nH.

(RG 10, Volume 6207, file 468-5, part 7)\nApril 30, 1937\n\nMr. Mills:\n\nI wish to report that in accordance with instructions contained in Mr. Wardle's memorandum of April 6th, I made an inspection of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School, at Muncey, on Monday and Tuesday, April 26th and 27th.\n\nWith regard to the Annex Building this building was erected as the original building, in 1883, and enlarged in 1886. During the past few years considerable improvements have been made to this building, which now contains three classrooms and living quarters for two of the staff.\n\nThe South wall of this building was torn down and rebuilt two years ago. The cement facing plaster over the masonry walls at that time was poorly applied and is now partially loose, flaking and peeling off. This surface should be entirely stripped and replaced with 1/2 inch cement plaster coating, carefully and properly applied.\n\nThe North wall of the same building has settled considerably and has left this wall in an unsound condition. Although the wall is now structurally unsound and might easily remain serviceable for several years, precaution should be taken to keep it against complete fracture. The accompanying diagram, No. 1, shows a sectional diagram of the surface cracks. Although it is impossible to see the actual brick well behind the plaster facing, this facing is very sound and the surface cracks can be considered as cracks in the masonry wall. Two methods of precaution are possible for this wall, depending on the intentions of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\n1. If the building is only to be used for a few years it would be more economical to merely brace the wall from outside with timber buttresses.\n\n2. If the building is to be used indefinitely the wall will have to be torn down and rebuilt. Nothing will not be considered advisable as a settlement for both the Annex Building and the Main Building. The unsoundness due to the erosion of the river bank causing a general settlement of the land all along the North side of the property. Thus, any expensive repair work at the moment...\nmoment would undoubtedly be undermined in a short time. This settling action is also affecting the North end of the Main building which parallels the Annex Building.\n\nWith regard to the main building the brick arches are flattening and dislodging brick along the underside of the arches. This loosening can only be explained by the settlement of the building at the North end, which would tend to remove the lateral support over the arches. The accompanying diagrams, Nos. 2 and 3, explain this action. These dislodged bricks can easily be replaced at a very small cost.\n\nThe general layout of the buildings mentioned above and other buildings of the Institute is shown on the accompanying diagram, No.4. After a general survey of the Annex and Main Building I would recommend extensive or expensive repairs to either buildings. The general condition of the interior are not ideal, but under the circumstances it can be maintained and operated for the present.\n\nA general survey of the conditions in the residence shows that the plaster walls and ceilings are badly cracked; plaster loose; and in many places has fallen off; floors need refinishing in many places; in the boys' bedroom the floor has buckled in three or four places; stair treads are worn thin; in general the walls are badly soiled and in need of redecoration.\n\nStructurally the towers above the central portion of the School are very detrimental to the building, as in high winds they sway and cause cracks in the building. As a result of this motion there are cracks leaking in the roof which result in saturation of the interior walls and ceiling. This has rotted the wood facing beneath the eaves around the building. The brick walls have many settlement cracks in places where the bricks should be repointed or removed and rebuilt.\n\nThe boiler room at the rear of the building should be torn down and rebuilt, as the walls are in very poor condition and the roof leaks badly.\n\nThe heating system is very unsatisfactory during cold weather, and its condition should be reported on by a competent heating engineer.\n\nIn a general report two years ago the Architect of the Department of Indian Affairs estimated a cost of $15,000 to renovate and improve the building for satisfactory operation, and in subsequent reports advised against renovation as he did not consider the buildings worth it.\n\n(sgd.)

Differential taps and discs be supplied for all radiators to replace the existing packless valves and diaphragms which are not functioning properly.\n\n2. That a vacuum pump and regulating valves with automatic control be installed and the thermostat be located in the Principal's apartment.\n\n3. That an automatic stoker be installed in connection with the present E. Leonard & Sons return tubular boiler.\n\nThe above recommendations embody the main items in the report of the C.A. Dunham Co., engineer who inspected the heating system and forwarded his report to Mr. Orr in October 14th, 1935.\n\nI would point out that the masonry and the roof are badly in need of attention.

To supply and install differential top and disc for all radiators to replace the existing packless valves and diaphragms which are not functioning properly.\n\n2. That a vacuum pump and regulating valves with automatic control be installed and the thermostat be located in the Principal's Office.\n\nI would like to point out that the intention is to repair the system only to the extent of providing adequate and satisfactory heating for the building. I would therefore appreciate the advice of your engineer as to the soundness and extent of the above repairs, or advice as to further, or alternative repairs, as might be required under the circumstances.\n\nA brief specification covering - 1. The replacement of existing valves and the number of differential top and disc units required. 2. The material and equipment required for the installation of the vacuum pump, automatic control and thermostat.\n\nThanking you for your consideration in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.

Davis in part payment of a plumbing contract carried out at Mount Elgin residential School. The balance of the account $250.97 was paid in 1937-38. On page 6 of the account appears the following item, \"32 ft. 4\" sewer tile, 20\u00a2 per ft. = $92.16\".

However, another error has been found on Page 6 of the account. On repairs to Outside Drainage he has included an item of 364 feet of 4-inch sewer tile at 20\u00a2 per foot at $92.16, whereas, the correct amount of this item should be $76.00, thus making an overpayment of $15.36.

Mr. Innis and Mr. Frank reported at Mount Elgin School and a thorough inspection was made of the existing heating system. Mr. Brewer did not report. Mr. Innis phoned his office stating that he was busy and did not wish to tender on the work. After the inspection Mr. Innis and Mr. Frank were requested to submit their estimate covering the material and labour required. Due to the necessity of securing prices from suppliers on some of the equipment their prices were not available until Tuesday evening. On Tuesday evening the following quotations were received:\n\nDouglas & Innis - Materials $1,090.00 Labour $160.00 Total $1,250.00\n\nHerbert Frank - $1,445.92 Total $1,568.92\n\nThese prices were then forwarded to the Chief Engineer at Ottawa, and instructions were received by wire on Wednesday evening, October 29th, to place the work with the firm of Douglas and Innis. On Thursday, October 30th, Douglas and Innis were advised that their tender was satisfactory and they were requested to begin work as soon as possible in accordance with the General Conditions, Labour Conditions, and Specifications pertaining to the heating repairs. This work is to begin about October 27th and should be completed in ten days.\n\nWith regard to the General Repair work at the Mount Elgin School, Mr. John Drake of Stratford, was asked Thursday morning and requested to report at Ministry. Mr. Drake reported Thursday afternoon, October 26th, and a general survey was made of the repair work. The work was outlined, and discussed and on Saturday morning, October 28th, a bill of materials was drawn up and orders placed with local firms for materials required. Mr. Drake was informed as to hiring of labour, rates, etc., and arrangements to commence work immediately. Mr. Frank Stafford was recommended for the plastering work, and Indian labour for all other work was to be secured through the Indian Agent.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nFor some years the roof of the main boiler room of the school has been in a state of dis-repair. It is in such a condition now that unless immediate repairs are made a new roof will have to be placed at considerable expense and in the meantime serious damage is likely to occur to the heating equipment. I took the matter up with your Mr. Dudley when he was here and he advised me that it would be necessary for me to write to you for authority as the repair would be separate from what is being carried out under his supervision at present.\n\nAs the firm of Douglas & Sons who are executing the repairs to the heating system are general contractors and carry a large stock of roofing materials I took the liberty of asking them to quote a price so that I might be able to state the probable cost in my letter to you. I beg to enclose herewith their quotation and request authority to have the work carried out as soon as possible.\n\nWith reference to the repairs to the heating plant I may say that for the first time since I entered the school in 1929 I have been able to go into the boys' dormitory and feel that they were at least reasonably comfortable. I may say that it is now possible to heat the whole building with very little trouble. I wish to express my very sincere appreciation of your consideration in this matter and to assure you of the co-operation of the staff and myself in the carrying out of the program of education for the Indian people.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He further states it is in such condition now that, unless immediate repairs are made, a new roof will have to be placed later, at considerable additional expense. In the meantime, there might be serious damage done to the heating equipment. When Mr. Dudley last visited the Mt. Elgin Residential School, the Principal brought this matter to his attention, and Mr. Dudley advised him that he would have to apply here for authority for the repairs.\n\nThe firm of Douglas & Innes, who are now executing repairs to the heating system, have given the following quotation for doing the necessary work to the roof of the main boiler room:\n\n\"In reference to roofing the boiler room at school, we beg to submit a price for the 26 gauge galv. roofing, galv. ridge roll and galv. flashing at chimney and main building wall, and to raise the pitch 10\u00b0 in centre and close in the end complete to replace all decayed rafters and sheeting - for the sum of One Hundred and Eighty five Dollars.\"\n\nYou will note that they will do the necessary work for an amount of $185.00, and I would appreciate it if you would give the necessary instructions for this work to proceed.\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO: Rev.

Davis for plumbing work on Mount Elgin School, Muncey, Ontario, I may say that this matter has been carefully looked into and we have no record of any work having been undertaken by us at this school during the period when the claim in question appears to have originated.\n\nApparently this claim of Mr. Davis relates to work which was carried out by your Branch and the letter in question is returned herewith for your further attention.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nApril 1, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th ultimo with reference to certain work performed by Mr. Harvey M. Davis at the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School, Muncey Indian Reserve.\n\nThere was some delay in completing payment for the work done by Mr. Davis due to the fact that the accounts were incorrectly prepared and finally we were obliged to send our engineer to the school to check the work which he had done.\n\nIt was finally decided that a reasonable amount to allow him would be $2,750.97. A payment of $2,500.00 was made to Mr. Davis in January, 1937, and a cheque for the balance, namely $250.97, was sent to him on May 11, 1937.

Hoey,\n\nI would acknowledge receipt of your letter 7-0-5 of October 1st enclosing account submitted by John A. Drake, Strathroy, Ontario, for materials and labour at Mount Elgin Residential School amounting to $104.31 on which you ask for further information.\n\nWhen Mr. Drake compiled his estimate at the request of the Rev. Principal it was for repairs to be made on a dwelling house formerly occupied by one of the staff which had been vacant for a number of years and was in a bad state of repair. This estimate was forwarded to the Department through this office on August 16th and was satisfactory to the Principal but after Mr. Drake had commenced work it was found instead of needing only 150 brick to fix the chimneys it required 400 and extra labour and the chimneys had to be rebuilt completely.\n\nIn estimating the plastering needing repair, Mr. Drake only estimated patching whereas it was found that practically all the old plaster had to be removed and fresh plaster applied. Mr. Drake was also short in his estimate of the needs of locks on the doors of this dwelling nearly all of which had to be replaced with new locks.\nThe cost of materials and labour on these three items was responsible for the increase in the account and Mr. Drake was requested to do this work on the instructions of Rev. O. B. Strapp, Principal of the school.\n\nVoucher no. 240 is returned herewith and is recommended for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEnclosure.\n\nA. D.

Yes\n- 30 pupils in vocational training departments.\n- 2 pupils sick.\n- 1 pupil absent. Reasons: Truant whom police cannot locate.\n- Total number on roll: 157\n\nAre there any pupils in residence whose admission has not been approved by the Department?\n- No\n\nHEALTH, SANITATION, Etc.\n\nAppearance of pupils: Pupils appear well dressed.\nCleanliness of school: All buildings kept clean and tidy.\nAppearance of school grounds: Well kept.\nCare of the sick: Well cared for by the Agency Med. Supt. and School Nurse.\nThe children's meals: Potato soup, peanut butter, fruit cake, bread & milk.\nFire drill, escapes and protection: Adequate fire escapes, fire hose and equipment.\n\nVOCATIONAL TRAINING\n\nDomestic instruction: Grades 4 to 8 under direction of graduate dietitian.\nInstruction in farming and gardening: Grades 4 to 8 under qualified farm foreman.\nTraining in the care of live stock: Grades 4 to 8 under qualified herdsmen & poultryman.\nManual training: Wood work, brass pounding, weaving and metalwork taught to selected pupils.\nCare of agricultural machinery and other equipment: Stored in implement sheds.\n\nGENERAL\n\nDiscipline at the school: Good.\nEfficiency of the staff: Appear quite efficient.\nGeneral management: Good.\n\nSuggestions: Repairs badly needed to valley caves, troughing and conductor pipes on main school building and wings. Estimated 50 slate shingles needed to stop roof leaks. Total cost in the vicinity of $200.00.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nForm No. 217\nMuncey, February 9th, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find enclosed Agent's report on a visit of inspection made to Muncye Indian Residential School on February 6th and at the time of this visit the Rev. Principal drew my attention to leaks in the roof of the main building due to broken and missing slates and he estimates in the vicinity of fifty new slates are necessary at forty cents each to make these repairs.\n\nThe Principal also reported the need of replacing a considerable portion of the Valley eavestroughing on the main building which eavestroughing, due to age, has rusted and is full of holes and the water leaks in and causes considerable damage to the building and should be renewed. The conductor pipes on both the wings of the school proper are missing, having been broken off and the pipe is full of holes and needs replacing as it is doing harm to the brick work and the school is losing rain water that they generally use for the purpose of making fuel or repairing eavestroughing and conductor pipes is uncertain and only a tinsmith could estimate accurately. The Principal considers repairs could be made if $175.00 were made available.\n\nThe brass pounding and weaving work is going ahead very successfully and the pupils enjoy this and other manual training work and have shown a marked aptitude by the finished articles they have made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nP.S.\n\nADM: AMC\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6207, file 468-5, part 8)\nOttawa,\nFebruary 13, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant with reference to your recent inspection of the Mount Elgin Indian residential school. Owing to lack of funds it is not possible at the present time to authorize the expenditure required to repair the eaves troughing. Please bring this matter to my attention early in April when the matter will receive further consideration.\n\nWhile it is noted from the first paragraph of your letter that the new slates for the roof would only cost approximately $20.00 I presume that there would be considerable expense for labour. As our funds for the current fiscal year are completely assigned I regret that it will not be possible to favourably consider this expenditure now.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nR. A.

O. B. Strapp, Principal of this School requests that additional space be provided to accommodate his classes in weaving and makes a suggestion that for $500.00 he could erect a suitable building and use the present concrete root-cellar for the foundation of such a building.\n\nI am not enthused at the idea of building new additions at Mount Elgin School and do consider that the present buildings being old will soon need a large expense in repairs and upkeep and that consideration should soon be given to the erection of a new modern school, providing it is intended to go into an extensive manual training programme. I also believe that through the aid being given Indians to re-establish themselves on their reserves, there should be less need of placing children in a residential school like Mount Elgin in future years and that children will be reared by their parents and not in a boarding school.\n\nIf a policy of sending fewer children to a residential school like Mount Elgin was pursued and the enrollment cut by a third at least it would leave a lot of space available at the school to use for manual training and technical training, without building additional buildings. It is suggested that an official of the Department visit Mount Elgin school at an early date to make a complete report in this connection and its future possibilities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nA.

Cedar is the cheaper of the two.\n\nWater Table; 900 ft.

Your letter 7-0-5 of February 9-40, and it is requested that this work now be proceeded with.\n\nKindly send forward the $110.00 that it was estimated would be necessary to pay for the labour on this job, under the foremanship of Mr. James Clarke of Delaware, Ont.\n\nTwenty-five bags of cement will be needed for the work as this cement has been used in storage at the school and will not be fit for use, while I am afraid the cement in each bag has hardened up and would not be satisfactory if used.\n\nThe tops of the two water storage tanks used in connection with the laundry, which tanks are underground and the tops are of wood, have rotted away and need replacing at once with concrete tops and I ask your early consideration in this connection.\n\nThese tanks are of brick construction, one being 12 feet square and the other 12 feet in diameter, both being 14 feet deep and they are in order to all corners of the school for when the wooden tops of these tanks are away, the Principal had the cement covered to remove and they have a tendency to leak.\n\nTo install proper cement tanks, these tanks that are reinforced with iron are followed as noted,\n\n1) 70 pieces of 6\" x 14 feet.\n2) 1 piece of 8\" x 14 feet.\n3) 1 piece of 10\" x 14 feet.\n4) 1 line of No. 12 black wire.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6207, file 468-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOCT 21\n\nDear Sir;\n\nConfirming my last letter of Oct. 15th, I would advise that the toilets in the three local institutions at Mount Elgin Residential School are out of order and need immediate attention.\n\nWhen Mr. Brown and Armstrong visited me of this school a few weeks ago, Mr. Brown went up to the roof of Mount Elgin, Ont., to see where the water pipe was located. It was found that the well pipe from these toilets was located badly and filled with refuse from the third floor to the basement and that it would not be advisable to use these old pipes, which have been there since the school was built, forty-five years ago, and that the most economical method in the long run would be to replace over 30 feet of this well pipe with new heavy construction.\n\nAs the cost of the work will be high and the school in the building budget, I recommend Mr. Armstrong to proceed at once with the work so that the new materials and labor needed by the school will not be in the way but of $75.00 and I could find some approval of this expenditure.\n\nI am not totally confident in quite such matters, as he has probably seen fit to do in the past.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.J.

In view of the fact that the girls secure positions, either domestic or commercial, where electric machines are used, one or both of these ought to be driven electrically so that the girls may learn the operation of such machines.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nMay 2nd, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn May 1st the Rev. O. B. Strapp, Principal of Mount Elgin School advised me that the main drain coupled with the septic tank laundry in barns was blocked up and on visiting the school to inspect the drain I find that at the outlet where the drain enters into the River Muncey a third of a mile distant from the school buildings, over 150 feet of the drain has caved in and the outlet tiles are all broken. This tile drain is 15 feet deep at its outlet and until it is dug out it will not be possible to find where the stoppage occurs and it would be necessary to commence at the outlet and work backwards.\n\nThe drain was put in many years ago and Mr. Strapp does not know of its construction and it may be possible that it is a 10\" field tile or a wooden box drain. This can only be found out when the drain is opened.\n\nIn view of the depth of the drain it will be expensive to open the same but it should be done at once so that water and refuse will not back up into the school buildings through the septic tank. As the overflow from the septic tank, the drains from the main building, the barns and the cultivated fields all empty into this outlet, it is therefore important to me myself that the septic tank outlet should be on a separate drain and carried to the river at its closest point from the tank which would greatly shorten the length of such outlet and it is suggested that the Department send an Official at an early date to investigate and report as a large expenditure will be involved in any case.\n\nPending your instructions I will at once engage men to open this drain to try and eliminate the present blockage and will pay wages from our Welfare Account to be reimbursed at a later date from the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor A.

At that time you should give particulars regarding any material such as tile that may be required to replace the tile in use at present.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The estimated cost of labour would be $75.00 and to date I have expended from Welfare Funds at this office the sum of $17.50 to open this drain pending your instructions regarding repair.\n\nThe outlet for a distance of one hundred and twenty feet had completely caved in and the tile were all broken and it will be necessary to relay this drain with new tile for that distance and as the ditch is fifteen feet deep some lumber is needed for shoring to protect the workmen engaged to prevent accidents from cave in.\n\nIt is my intention at the outlet to embed twenty feet of sewer tile in cement to prevent any breakage from frost and to construct a cement apron as well.

Three bearings at $1.50 each are also needed and the cost of welding broken parts will run over $5.00. The main drive pulley which is 30 inches in diameter is quite badly bent and it may be possible to have it repaired, failing which it will be necessary to buy a new pulley.\n\nThe Staff at the school will do all work except the welding and I have instructed the Principal to procure the shaft from the firm of James Wright, London, Ontario, so that this laundry may be placed in operation as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Elgin School, has informed me that some repair work on the ceiling is urgently needed in the primary classroom in the annex building of the school. On inspection of the room I found that the plaster on the ceiling has cracked in many places and small portions of it have already fallen off. If this is not repaired it will be a menace to the pupils in the room and I would recommend that the classroom be repaired as soon as possible.\n\nThe ceiling of the classroom is 32 ft. long and 25 ft. wide and Mr. Strapp and I agree that it should be covered with Tentest material instead of plaster. It would take 300 ft. of Tentest \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\" thick at an estimated cost of $68.32 plus 20 lineal ft. of 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" lattice stripping at a cost of $4.32. The labour in putting on the Tentest would be approximately $20.00 making a total estimated expenditure of $68.32.\n\nWalls of this classroom need painting as do the ceilings in all five rooms of the northern end of second-floor apartment in the annex building. About seven gallons of paint costing $31.50 would be necessary. Two gallons of turpentine, one gallon of boiled oil and three pounds of ordinary glue to fill in the cracks in the plaster on the walls before painting would be necessary. It would require about two gallons of grey paint paid for by the ceilings of the apartment rooms and three gallons of buff paint for the walls of the classroom. According to the Principal, this painting could be done with a spray gun by the pupils of the school and no labour costs in painting would be involved.\n\nThe total estimated cost of the materials for the above would be $24.00 and labour in putting on the Tentest would be $20.00.\n\nI would recommend that authority be granted to purchase the materials locally so that there will be no delay and the repairs effected before school reopens on Sept. 1st. Suitable Indian labour is very scarce now and I would wish authority to employ white labour to put on the Tentest as Indians cannot be obtained to do the work which is very doubtful at the present time. Payment of labour and materials would be made by voucher from the Department if the expenditure is approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. W. McCracken, In Charge\nGaradoc Agency.\n\nSecretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nAugust 14, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant the following expenditures at the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School are approved:\n\n1. Material and labour for repairing classroom ceiling -- $68.32.\n\n2. Material for painting the walls of the classrooms and the ceilings in five rooms in the northern end of the second floor -- $31.50.\n\nPurchase of the above materials may be made locally and if Indians cannot be secured to put on the Tentest white labour may be employed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJ.R.

In the event of materials being required, detailed information should be supplied, as this is required by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nDue to present conditions it is most important that we hear from you at the earliest possible date. As you are aware, it is extremely difficult to obtain deliveries on many items and, therefore, the sooner the order is placed the better for all parties concerned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Geo. W. Down,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nJuly 8, 1942.\n\nAttention Mr. Hoey,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour File 7-0-5.\n\nReplying to your letter of June 18th re; improvements at the Mount Elgin Institute.\n\nAfter a careful inspection, in company with Mr. Strapp, it was decided that the amount available for improvements, in the present fiscal year, namely $350.00, could be used to better advantage in a general way. That is, rather than any elaborate undertaking, a number of very necessary repairs. For instance, the boys' playroom is in a very dilapidated condition; the drainage in the girls' wash room; the roof needs patching in several places; some painting to be done and other little jobs.\n\nIt would be almost impossible to submit an intelligent report as to materials required, as the work to be done is more or less a series of local contracts and would have to be let, in some cases with the contractor supplying his own materials. For instance, it is a slate roof and we cannot decide the number of slates required and the other jobs are somewhat of the same nature, and the material would have to be purchased as required.\n\nOwing to the difficulty in securing help, I would suggest that I receive prices on the different jobs, purchase whatever materials are necessary, as we go along. It will then be a simple matter to keep within the allotted amount.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nGWD/HM.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6207, file 468-5, part 9)\nShould these suggestions meet with your approval, you will please advise me as soon as possible. I can then proceed with the work. If, however, you have other suggestions that would suit the condition, I shall be pleased to co-operate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. W. Down,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 13, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to repairs and improvements at the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School.\n\nThis request has been carefully reviewed, but I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to your recommendation. As you are aware, we have purchasing regulations which require that when expenditures for material amount to more than $50.00 purchase has to be made through the Purchasing Branch. Under these circumstances there is no alternative except to forward to us detailed information regarding materials necessary, and we will endeavour to secure them at the earliest possible date. You realize, of course, that it is difficult to obtain many articles, due to present conditions, and when securing materials that are available, delay is unavoidable. However, as stated above, we will endeavour to secure them as soon as possible. You should let me know, also, how much will be required for labour, and an accountable cheque will be sent forward to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. G. W. Down,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nMinesey, Ontario,\nAugust 5, 1942.\n\nAttention Mr. Phelan.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: repairs to Mt. Elgin Institute\n\nYour File 7-0-5\n\nYour letter of July 13th has been giving Mr. Strapp and me much thought and planning and we find it almost impossible to submit a list of materials that could be intelligently submitted to the Purchasing Agent.\n\nAs I pointed out in my previous letter, we had decided to use the $500.00 for general repair jobs, rather than concentrate on any one particular improvement. For instance, one job would be to repair the roof which is not only in a bad state of repair and causing damage to the ceilings in the dormitories, but is very high and laid with slate. This type of work, owing to the smooth surface is very dangerous to the inexperienced. In this connection, I have made inquiries and my information is, that the men who repair these types of roofs, usually supply their own slates and make a charge per slate laid. Apparently, it is the only way this job could be done. Then we decided to repair the boys playroom. This has been a half wainscoted room with a plaster top, but owing to the continual repairing of the wainscoting it was thought, it would be wise to tear it out and replace it with a cement plaster wall. There are also several repair jobs to ceilings, caused through rain leaking down through the roof. The wash rooms also need minor repairs, etc., etc.\n\nIn all these repairs, you will of course understand, owing to our isolated position, how difficult it is to get a workman to drive in for the sole purpose...\nof submitting an estimate on any one of these jobs, especially under gasoline rationing and the rubber situation.\n\nThe quantities of any one material needed for the several repair jobs would be small and could be purchased on a basis of requirements as needed.\n\nHowever, I would suggest that this explanation be submitted to the Purchasing Agent's Office, with a view to granting permission to proceed with the work through local purchases of material as required, otherwise, I am afraid I cannot submit intelligent estimates unless I am prepared to provide transportation for the different tradesmen, to come in for the sole purpose of submitting estimates. Even then, I think it would be more or less on work than material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. W. Down,\nIndian Agent.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nGWD/HH.\nOttawa,\nAugust 10, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to an amount required for repairs to the Mount Elgin Residential School. Careful consideration has been given to the contents of your letter and, as I am under the impression that the greater part of the expenditure will be for labour, you may proceed with the necessary repairs and employ those on the approved list. I presume that the materials will be purchased in comparatively small quantities and from different firms.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G.W. Down,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nAugust 18th, 1942.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey;\n\nWe are having difficulty in obtaining certain repairs for the equipment of this school, also replacements in the line of large metal cooking utensils. Just a few days ago I needed a small Motor Starting Switch for one of the motors in the Manual Training Shop and on going to the branch of the General Electric Company in London was informed that they were unable to supply us without a Priority Order Number. The same thing happened when I went to the London office of The Canadian Liquid Air Co., to obtain materials for brazing and welding in connection with repairs to our farm implements. We are unable even to buy a keg of nails from our wholesale hardware dealer for general repair work around the school.\n\nI would appreciate it very much if you would take the matter up with the Priority Board and obtain for us a rating so that we can obtain these very necessary materials. The added expense and loss of time if we have to take all our repairs to London will be serious for us and will mean in many cases the scrapping of equipment which otherwise could be repaired and returned to service in the school.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6207, file 468-5, part 9)\nOttawa, August 21, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received by this Branch from the Reverend O. E. Strapp, Principal of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School, Kincardine, Ont.\n\nI am anxious to know if it would be possible to secure for Mr. Strapp the priority rating to which he refers. I should explain that, in addition to the repairs paid for by this Branch at residential schools, the principals themselves undertake, annually, a number of minor repairs, for the completion of which certain supplies are necessary. These are the repairs Mr. Strapp has in mind when he refers to the inconvenience of having to take machinery to London for the repairs that may be necessary from time to time.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnc.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nSept. 17, 1942.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Rev. O. B. Strapp, of the Mt. Elgin Residential School is making application through this Office, for the services of a night watchman and boilerman. This, I understand is a service required at the Institute for the 6 months from November 1st till April 30th.\n\nThe Indian who usually fills this position (Norman Seneca), is asking for an increase from $40.00 to $50.00 per month. I have already informed the Rev. Strapp, that I cannot recommend the increase, but would recommend he be hired for the 6 months at last year's terms, $40.00 per month. Please advise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. W. Down,\nIndian Agent.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nGWB/RH.\nOttawa, September 21, 1942.\n\nRe: Night Watchman,\nMt. Elgin Residential School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant and to state that the Department is prepared to make the same allowance as last year for a night watchman at the Mount Elgin School. It is noted from the records that the school was authorised to employ a night watchman last year for 6 months at the rate of $40.00 per month.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSept. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. G. W. Down,\nIndian Agent,\nNunney, Ont.\nAttention of Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRev. O. B. Strapp, Principal of the Muncey School, was in yesterday and brought with him a letter which he had received from the Tire Controller. Mr. Strapp had applied for three retreads and one new tire for his car. The Controller writes:\n\n\"It is regretted that existing tire regulations do not provide for the supplying of replacement tires for the vehicle which is described in your application and, therefore, it will be impossible for us to grant the permit which is requested.\" (Sgd.: \"Ross D. Borrett, Room 2111, #3 Building - File C.S. 4M)\n\nI hope you will find it possible in some way to take this up and have these regulations amended. Otherwise, I am afraid we shall be under the painful necessity of closing the Muncey School. You may say that this is an extreme view to take; but the fact is that this School is twenty miles from London, which is the nearest town, and you will realize that it is quite impossible to carry on work at this School without having a car to go into London on business and take the teachers and members of the staff for weekend leave. If Mr. Strapp were a minister on a small rural field with three appointments, he would, without any question, get the tire ration which he requests, and I have no hesitation in saying that this School is far more important than a small pastoral charge. It is true that Mr. Strapp has a truck, but he cannot take any passengers in the truck and it is far more expensive to operate.\n\nI do not think that the Church or the Department would be making an unreasonable request in asking for reconsideration of this ruling. I should be glad if you would take the matter up through the proper officials and let us know as soon as possible whether Mr. Strapp can get this necessary permit.\n\nMr. Strapp has also asked me to write about the possibility of getting some priority ratings for the Muncey School - I presume this will apply to other Schools as well. He finds it impossible to carry on his work unless he gets something like that. For example, he has a welding outfit which enables him to do many repairs which are necessary. He cannot get supplies for this unless he gets some priority rating.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6207, file 468-5, part 9)\nAgain, when he goes to buy shoes for the children, he is very much embarrassed because manufacturers cannot give him reasonably prompt delivery.\n\nI know that you will agree that this type of institution is very necessary, and that in some way or other it should be possible for them to be treated in a way different from the ordinary private individual.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\n[Signature]\nLocal Rubber Company\nJ.C.

This official is of the opinion that there is not even a remote possibility of securing adjustments along the lines suggested. In this connection you may be interested to learn that the Department has abandoned the operation of its own cars and that the regulations governing the operation of cars are steadily becoming more restrictive. In any event, if adjustments or modifications are likely to take place, they will not take place until someone with greater influence and authority than the officials of this Branch presses for such adjustments. It has occurred to me that this is a matter you might take up with the Munitions and Supply Board when you visit Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. A.

This morning I sent an official of this Branch over to interview the Purchasing Agent in respect to the matter. The Purchasing Agent now informs us that it is not possible to secure a rating for your school or a rating that would enable you to purchase the supplies necessary in mind. His suggestion is that the supplies necessary at the school be purchased by the Purchasing Division of this Department and that a financial settlement be worked out immediately following each transaction. I must say that I am not at all satisfied with this ruling. If the officials responsible for issuing priority ratings from time to time refuse to give ratings to our schools, I find it difficult to see how we can keep these schools open and in operation. However, I feel rather helpless in regard to the whole matter. I appreciate very fully, after my visit to your school, the urgent need at the institution for certain supplies and certain repairs. I have informed you that the officials here that I would not tolerate the conditions at your school 24 hours if they were coming in contact with them, as you are, from day to day. In view of the fact that it is the intention of the Churches to interview the Government at an early date would it be possible for you to bring this matter to their attention and the Secretary of the Home Mission Board? I make this suggestion because it seems to me that the securing of supplies for our schools - always a difficult matter - has reached a stage when it is almost impossible to secure supplies at all.\n\nR.

From my personal knowledge, I am aware that some of these repairs are absolutely essential if the School is to be carried on at all. The unsanitary condition of the playroom and washroom is beyond description. If the condition were due to neglect on the part of the principal or the staff, we could assume responsibility, but it is obvious to anybody with average intelligence that this is due to the fact that the building and everything about it is old and needs repair.\n\nPersonally, we should not feel so strongly about the matter if the money had not been voted, but the money is available, and we want to know why the work has not been done.

MacInnes, Secretary, Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of Dec. 9, re repairs at the Mt. Elgin Institute. In this connection I am wondering whether or not the Home Missions' Board of the United Church were also advised as to the difficulties we are experiencing in securing responsible labour of any kind, especially in our isolated position.\n\nOn learning of the current year's appropriation no time was lost in discussing with the Rev. Mr. O. B. Strapp, Principal of the Mt. Elgin Institute, the most important necessary repairs. Previous correspondence will bear this out and every endeavour was made to get estimates on the various repairs, without avail. This can be attributed to one or several reasons,\u2014shortage of responsible labour, gasoline rationing, tire conservation or perhaps an indifference to working on and in such a building. Whatever the cause, I have to date been unable to locate a responsible man capable of doing the work. Mr. Strapp, on his own initiative, hired an Indian to tear up some drains. The necessary pipes were ordered and after delivery, which was within a few days of ordering, his Indian disappeared. He has recently returned to finish his job but I think the stench got the better of him as he is now on sick leave. What is badly needed at this Institution is a little more cooperation and less criticising.\n\nHowever, as far as the Mt. Elgin Institute is concerned, and it is not my intention to enter into any lengthy controversy, I am at a standstill. Tire, gasoline and wear and tear will not permit the unrestricted use of\n\np.t.o.\nmy car in locating a man and correspondence is useless. However, the Home Missions Board know of capable men, in the close vicinity, badly in need of work and will advise them to get in touch with this office, I can assure them that every consideration will be given to see that they are promptly put to work.\n\nIn conclusion Mr. Hoey, since assuming responsibility of this Agency I have been a very, very, busy man. I am still busy and such a report from the Mission Board of the United Church with its glaring inception is not appreciated.\n\nG. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\nOttawa,\nDecember 15, 1948.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant and my reply of the 9th instant, the following report has been received from Indian Agent Down:\n\n\"On learning of the current year's appropriation no time was lost in discussing with the Rev.

Mr. Strapp came in to see me yesterday and suggested that, if he could get $500.00 made available, he could make the basement a good deal more satisfactory than it is at the present time, and also make some other necessary minor repairs to the building. Do you think it would be possible to make $500.00 available to Mr. Strapp, so that he could use it for day labour? If $500.00 is too much - then $499.98 might be more easily got through the meshes of the law!\n\nI should be glad to hear from you about this.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJune 24th,\n1943.\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: MINES & RESOURCES\n\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nDATE: July 8, 1943\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE NO. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | REV.

Strapp,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, May 6, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Arneil:\n\nA few days ago we sent forward to Mr. Jackson, for his consideration, a request we had received for certain repairs to the roof of the Mount Elgin Institute.\n\nIn a phone message from Mr. Jackson a few moments ago, he is very anxious to know what our policy in respect to this school is likely to be and is naturally not anxious to spend money on the school building in case we decide to close it at any time in the immediate future. I pointed out to him that the Back Settlement School had been destroyed by fire; that the school at Stoney Point had been abandoned and sold for a residence and that in view of these facts the closing of the Mount Elgin Institute could scarcely be considered at this particular time. When he learned of your visit to Caradoc, he was anxious to have an expression of opinion from you in respect to these repairs, their urgency, the cost, etc. It would be greatly appreciated, therefore, if you would discuss the matter with Mr. Strapp and let us have, at the earliest possible date, an expression of opinion that we can send forward to Mr. Jackson.\n\nI am sending forward herewith copies of correspondence relating to this matter, for your guidance.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

On the various sides small numbers of slates are missing and these spaces have mostly been filled in with galvanized iron. The main leakage is caused by snow melting and being held on the roof by four cornices. To correct this condition and permit the water to run freely into the eavestroughs it is considered necessary to cut off the ends of the cornices. In addition, four valleys have broken slates which require replacement and the valley iron repainted with an asphalt composition.\n\nThe eavestroughing around the building is in need of cleaning. Some places are clogged with dead leaves and birds' nests as well as pieces of broken slate.\n\nIt is my opinion that this repair work, while necessary, is of a more minor nature than that indicated.\nby Mr. Elean's estimate.\n\nI have asked Mr. Strapp to get in touch with a roofing contractor already known to him, in London, Ontario, who previously examined the roof and submitted an estimate, and to solicit from him a new estimate and failing this to try to contact a competent slater who might consider doing the work on a labour basis under the direction of the Agent or Principal.\n\nIt is my opinion that the necessary labour plus material could be secured and the roof adequately repaired for a sum not exceeding $500.00\n\nThis repair work is not of great urgency but should be done before another winter. The leakage through melting snow being held each Spring from the cornices has existed for years and is aggravated when the snowfall is heavy. The valley iron should be painted and the broken slates renewed also before another winter. The eaves-troughs can be cleaned at any time. The School Principal states he is unable to have this work done owing to the absence from the School on farm work of the larger boys.\n\nMr. Strapp has intimated that he will communicate direct with Mr. Hoey when additional estimates or other information has been received.\n\nI might add in giving this opinion of the approximate cost and urgency of repairs to this large slate roof that perhaps it would be better to have an architect make a more careful examination, and having in mind that the roof repairs do not solve the problem of this building I would not recommend that any greater sum than that of my estimate be expended without a careful examination by a building expert.\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, May 15, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Roof Repairs, Mount Elgin Institute.\n\nI desire to refer to my memorandum to you dated April 21, 1944.\n\nIn this connection I am sending forward, for your information, copy of a report on the marginally-noted subject, received by me from Inspector Arneil.\n\nIncl.\n\nDirector.\nTHE MOUNT ELGIN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nMuncey - Ontario\n\nMay 11, 1944.\n\nMr. D.

Leppard regarding his tender to make repairs to the roof of this building.\n\nI wish to thank you for your help and cooperation in this and other matters regarding the Institution.

Elgin Residential School with a view to decorating, I have to advise that I inspected this particular section of the building and submit herewith, for your consideration, the following in order of importance:\n\n1. Dining Room\n   Approximate Cost:\n   Material - $6.00\n   Labour - $9.00\n   Paint and Paper - $15.00\n\n2. Living Room\n   Approximate Cost:\n   Material - $5.00\n   Labour - $10.00\n   Paint and Paper - $15.00\n\n3. Four Bedrooms\n   Approximate Cost:\n   Material - $22.00\n   Labour - $40.00\n   Paint and Paper - $62.00\n\n4. Bathroom\n   Approximate Cost:\n   Material - $5.00\n   Labour - $10.00\n   Paint and Paper - $15.00\n\n5. Main Office\n   Approximate Cost:\n   Material - $7.00\n   Labour - $12.00\n   Paint and Paper - $19.00\n\nAll ceilings are 12 to 14 feet.\n\nI would also suggest that sufficient lumber be purchased to build a wall-type bookcase to accommodate library books. Two hundred feet of dressed pine lumber would be sufficient. The building of such a case could be done under Manual Training. The approximate cost of the lumber would be $20.00. The total cost of making all the repairs mentioned, including the bookcase, would be approximately $150.00.\n\nThis particular section of the building is dingy and depressing and I think Mr. Soper is entitled to consideration. I would therefore recommend that, if not all, as much of the listed repairs as possible be approved in order of importance.\n\nSubject to Approval\n\nUnder wartime regulations, and the fact that this is a personal decorating job with different paints and papers, it would be difficult for the Purchasing Agent to\nplace orders with the various merchants and expect any measure of assured delivery. I am therefore suggesting that the Reverend Mr. Soper, in co-operation with this Office, be given authority to choose and order all materials to advantage and suitable to his, and his wife's, particular tastes.\n\nGeo.

Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th instant, the Department approves the expenditures recommended by you in connection with the Principal's quarters at the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School. The Principal and yourself may arrange for local purchase of the materials required. An accountable cheque for $90 for labour will go forward under separate cover.\n\nThe Department also approves the building of a wall-type bookcase and the lumber may be purchased locally.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDuring a recent visit to the Mt. Elgin Residential School it was my pleasure to meet and talk with the Rev. Mr. Soper. Mr. Soper, as you are aware, is the new Principal recently appointed by the Home Mission Board of the United Church of Canada. The purpose of my visit was to inspect the principal's quarters and make a survey of the farm buildings. In conclusion, however, owing to Mr. Soper's desire and his sincere demonstration of will to co-operate, was much more intensive than I had intended. I am, therefore, passing on, in the form of a memorandum, a survey of the school buildings used exclusively for the accommodation of staff and pupils together with a few suggestions that would brighten and add to the comfort of all in residence.\n\nIn the main building adjoining the principal's quarters there is accommodation for staff in the form of three bedrooms, bath and one sitting room. Two of these bedrooms and bathrooms were decorated in 1943. I am suggesting that the remaining bedroom and sitting room be decorated this year.\n\nIn the same building the girls' dormitory, as referred to in Mr. Young's report and mentioned in your letter to the Rev. O.B. Stepp dated June 14th, needs brightening up. Paint will do this but of course it will not repair the floors, ceilings and sanitary system, all of which are major repair jobs.\n\nMy particular attention was drawn to the exits leading to the fire escapes. These exits are in the form of double sash windows and in every case, throughout the whole dormitory system, these exits were padlocked. I asked if this were the general procedure when all pupils were in residence and upon whose orders they were locked. I was told yes under orders of the Governing Principal, the reason being an endeavor to stop runaways. I registered strong disapproval with such a procedure and pointed out that it would be better to have runaways than have one child burned to death. I also pointed out that responsibility would rest directly with the person giving the order. I also stressed that fire exits and escape should be unbarred by any obstruction and ready for immediate exit and escape at all times. I would suggest that I be authorized to have these padlocks immediately removed and that in the meantime consideration be given to having the windows removed and replaced with doors equipped with regular panic bars, as suggested in your letter of June 14th.\nIn the basement I visited the pupils' dining hall. This is one of the most depressing rooms in the main building. The air is foul, the lighting is poor and it is badly in need of brighter decorating. For air circulation, a built-in, wall fan is suggested. Such an installation would be a great improvement and have a beneficial effect of relieving the room of the musty staleness. While it is located in the basement the light cannot be improved by natural light but it can be considerably improved artificially by using larger wattage bulbs and the installing of two more lights. The present colour scheme is both dark and dingy and could be greatly improved by a new paint job. With these suggested improvements it would add new life and could not help but react favourably on the pupils.\n\nAdjoining this hall is the kitchen, also various store rooms, wash rooms and play rooms all in need of various repairs, so much so that only a major repair job could be entertained.\n\nImmediately behind the main building is what is referred to as the classrooms. This is a two-story brick, 90' by 30', with exterior plastered walls. The north end of this building is bulging and the experts say that at the present time it is being held in place by a work of art, namely, 2 by 8 planks. On the ground floor there are three classrooms all more or less in need of decorating and all in need of better lighting. Above the classrooms there are three apartments all in need of various repairs and repainting. These apartments are approached by outside, uncovered wooden stairs all in a very dangerous, rotted condition. After a final inspection of the exterior and interior of this building I might recommend minor decorating but the logical recommendation would be complete demolition and rebuild.\n\nTo the south of this building is the laundry, 40' by 30'. This is a two-story building in fair repair. The ground floor is equipped with regular laundry tubs and sinks and appears to be in good running condition. The second floor appears to have been used for anything one had a mind to do. It is dirty, untidy and smelly and is a glaring example of neglect.\n\nImmediately south of this building is a frame building, 42' by 15'. This is known as the Manual Training building. It is 14\u00bd' tall,\u7f3a\u5c11\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ee7\u7eed\u3002\ndetail as to approximate cost of the repairs mentioned. There are too many little jobs, and materials would have to be purchased as one proceeded, but a rough estimate for material and labour would likely cover $500.00. This, of course, would only cover minor repair jobs such as painting and papering. The major job, namely, demolition and re-build would still remain.\n\nI have prepared a plan of these buildings which is herewith attached.\n\nGeo. W.

This letter will authorize you to incur an expenditure of the amount mentioned above. I understand that this is in addition to the expenditures authorized in my letter of July 28. If you require a further advance for labour please let me know.\n\nThe contents of your report have been read with considerable interest and, as I hope to visit the Caradoc Agency next week, I will have an opportunity of discussing it further with you.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, August 1, 1944.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nMr. Arneil is very anxious that I should accompany him when he visits Muncey on or about August 9, with the object of coming to an agreement with respect to the use of the farm buildings at the residential school. Mr. Arneil is at present engaged in an inspection trip of northern agencies but will return to Ottawa Saturday August 5. If he returns on that date, he and I might drive to Toronto on the 7th. If we do this I would like to interview you at your office on the morning of August 8, if this is convenient to you. I regret that the time at my disposal has not enabled me to give much thought to the proposal Mr. Arneil has in mind. However, he and the Indian Agent have given a great deal of thought to the matter and have, I understand, discussed it with Dr. Cochrane. I feel confident little difficulty will be experienced in reaching an agreement satisfactory to all parties concerned.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A.

Whether or not the complete roof is in a like condition, I do not know. The sample submitted was taken from the east side, the side now being repaired and Mr. Soper, thinks it is all more or less the same. Just how successful the patch work job will be and whether or not the climbing around and hammering will leave it in a worse condition is questionable.\n\nI am forwarding under separate cover, the sample brought in. You will note that the substance is completely gone and that it readily crumbles into a soft powdery mass; which, as long as it is not disturbed will, I suppose, act as a covering. The contract, of course, did not go through this office but I thought you would be interested in the condition of the slate.\n\nGeo W.

Down,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nMuncey.\n\nDear Mr. Down;\n\nIn reference to your recent visit to the school and Inspection of the Pump In the Steam Laundry may I say that The Beatty Bros Ltd estimate that the new pump will cost $210 less three percent cash, and about $10.00 labour and fittings.\n\nThe whole Laundry depends on this thirty year old pump and it is likely to play out any day now. I would appreciate your early recommendation in this matter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nS.H. Soper\nDuring a recent visit to the Mt. Elgin Residential School the Rev. Mr. Soper drew my attention to a pump used in the laundry of that Institution. The pump, it appears, is an old one and leaks badly around the valves. A pump man was called in and Mr. Soper advises that, owing to its age and the fact that parts are not available, he, the mechanic, will not touch it. Mr. Soper has since written Beatty Brothers for a price on a new installation which I submit herewith.\n\nOwing to the fact that the laundry operates only once a week, and that there would be ample time, I suggested that the pump be dismantled as it may be equipped with leather valves which need replacing; or perhaps gaskets are worn out. But between the mechanic and Mr. Soper they appear to have decided that it is definitely worn out. Maybe it is but I would like to examine the working parts before I recommend this expenditure. However, the request for a replacement is submitted for your consideration.\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nGWD/BC\n\nEnc1\nOttawa, October 12, 1944.\n\nMr. G. W. Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ont.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 6 and also copy of a letter relating to the necessity for a new pump at the Mount Elgin Residential School, received by you from Mr. Soper, and sent forward therewith.\n\nYou might discuss with Mr. Phelan at the time of his visit to the school the suggestion contained in the last paragraph of your communication. It is just possible that certain repairs to the present pump might enable it to function for a year or two, although our experience has been that few of these pumps, no matter how well installed and no matter how carefully operated, last for a period of 30 years. It would be appreciated also if you could let Mr. Phelan have full particulars with respect to a pump that might replace the one now in use. Any quotations received by Mr. Soper from Beatty Brothers should be sent forward.\n\nR. A.

Down,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey.\n\nDear Mr. Down;\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the condition of the hydro lines of this institution.\n\nI trust this report will be submitted to your attention at the earliest convenience.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOct 7th 1944.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nOctober 7th, 1944.\n\nI understand that Mr. Phelan, will visit this Agency during the week of October 9th, and that he intends visiting with the Rev. Mr. Soper. I therefore hasten to forward, for your consideration, a letter together with a report on the condition of the electrical wiring at the Mount Elgin Residential School and associate buildings. I hope I am wrong, but during unguarded moments of conversation I think I recognize an indirect squeeze.\n\nIt looks to me like a sizable expenditure, I therefore thought that you would like to discuss it with Mr. Phelan, that he may be acquainted with the matter.\n\nGeo W. Down,\nIndian Agent.\n\nenclosure.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nOn the occasion of my visit to the Mount Elgin School on the 13th instant I discussed with the Principal the report of the Hydro Electric Power Commission which was forwarded to the office under cover of Mr. Down's letter of October 7. To do all the work suggested by the Power Commission would probably involve an expenditure of $1500. However, the Principal considered that if he placed an amount of $300 at his disposal he could have the most urgent work receive attention now. This would include the removal of the locks from the windows leading to the fire escapes and installing electric bells in order that those in charge would know if the windows were being used.\n\nI also examined the old pump and I feel that a new one is required. The Principal intends to obtain detailed information regarding the style of pump required and will forward this to us.\n\nI recommend that he be advised we will allow $300 for the electrical repairs and that we purchase a new pump when we have the necessary information.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nCopy sent to Principal\n\nOttawa,\nOctober 23, 1944.\n\nMr. O.W. Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ont.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing report of the Hydro Electric Power Commission on the electric wiring at the Mount Algim Residential School. On the occasion of his recent visit to the school, Mr. Phelan discussed the matter with the Principal and it was felt that an expenditure of approximately $300 would cover the most necessary repairs at the present time. I understand that the Principal knows an electrician who is capable of doing the work. In addition to making the necessary repairs to the wiring it is intended to place electric connections on certain windows leading to the fire escapes. The locks should then be removed from these windows in order that they may be opened readily if necessary.\n\nI also understand the Principal is obtaining specific information regarding the new pump required for the laundry. As soon as this information is available it should be forwarded to the Department and our Purchasing Branch will handle the matter.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to the Principal.\n\nR.A.

Elgin Residential School, as requested in your letter of July 3rd, I know of no better way than to take you on an imaginary tour. To enable you to readily visualize positions and approximate distances from the main school buildings, I have prepared a rough plan which is herewith attached. To further assist I have numbered the buildings in order of our travel.\n\nStarting from a point south is Building No. 1. This is a large barn, 100' by 50', with annex attached 27' by 40'. The main building is constructed of slop cement stabling, wall with hip roof, upper structure all steel storage barn with cement silo attached. It is in first class condition throughout and fully equipped to house a large number of any type of farm animal.\n\nTravelling north a distance of approximately 200', we enter Building No. 2. This is a T-shaped barn measuring 100' by 40' and 70' by 30'. It has the same construction as No. 1 with two silos attached. It is in first class condition and especially equipped with steel stanchions and steel stalls to house approximately 100 head of cattle. It is, without doubt, one of the most up-to-date farms in Western Ontario.\n\nTravelling north a distance of approximately 150', we enter Building No. 3. This is an L-shaped building 30' by 50' and 50' by 60'. The 30' by 50' is in a dilapidated, unsafe condition and should be demolished. The 30' by 60' is an implement shed in a good state of repair.\n\nTravelling north a distance of approximately 100', we enter Building No. 4. This is a brick building 25' by 16'. The owner here is confused but at some time it has been used as a general repair for farm machinery. It is in need of major repairs.\n\nTurning west and travelling a distance of approximately 75', we enter Building No. 5, 60' by 20'. This is an all steel, dirt floor implement shed in a first class condition throughout.\nTurning south we travel a distance of approximately 100' and enter Building No. 6, 40' by 66'. This building has a brick foundation stabling with an all steel upper structure hay barn. It is equipped exclusively for horses having fourteen individual stalls and one box-stall. It is in first class condition.\n\nTravelling south and passing the main School buildings, a distance of approximately 500 ft., we enter Building No. 7. This is a two-story brick building, 24' by 24'. It is used as a general store house and the raising of early chickens. Some work on the outside brick is necessary to put this building in good repair.\n\nTurning west we travel a distance of approximately 250' and enter Building No. 8. This is a one-story, 20' by 50', frame henhouse in good condition.\n\nThe water system, throughout, is supplied from springs located on Indian property and is, I think, under long term lease. It is piped and pumped into pressure tanks and as far as is known, it has never failed.\n\nRoot storage facilities consist of two rooms, 14' by 24' each, both dry and suitable for any type of storage; also, one room, 15' by 40'. The smell here is very bad and the place is musty and wet. However, its location lends itself readily to drainage and I think that is all it needs to correct the condition.\n\nThis completes our tour and general survey of the farm buildings; and I would say constitute one of the finest and most up-to-date set of farm buildings in Western Ontario. Under proper management and with the lease land attached they could be made to serve the full requirements of the Mt. Elgin Residential School, not only in the matter of providing food for the pupils and staff but one of the most up-to-date instructional centres for all Indians in Ontario, west of Toronto. There would of course, changes and perhaps a few problems before realization of a plan could materialize, but nothing of a nature that cooperation could not overcome.\n\nIn submitting this report please keep in mind that it is merely a report on the barns and outbuildings in an endeavour to enable you to decide as to the advisability of renting or utilizing them in our general Welfare program as suggested in your letter of July 3rd.\n\nGeo.

Built for lifetime service, they combine with the most rugged construction and heaviest of cooking tops, unusual strength in oven door design. The \"Chef Junior\" line of heavy duty ranges consists of three sizes of complete units, each with firebox at left hand end and with one, two or three ovens. These units may be combined to make any arrangement required.\n\nSpecifications\n\nBody\u2014Constructed of 14 gauge steel\n\nFirebox\u2014Lined with best grade firebrick 4\" thick. Coal grate is heavy oscillating basket type, easily removable and constructed so that the entire fire may be dumped. For wood a flat grate can be supplied in place of the basket type. Use with blower; coal a flat horizontal grate to fit on top of basket grate can be furnished at additional cost.\n\nFlue System\u2014Lined with firebrick where necessary to give added protection from corrosive gases. Efficient standard flue system with draft damper in flue exit below oven. Draft at ashpit door and at end of firebox.\n\nFuel Economizer in Smoke Pipe\n\nCooking Top\u2014Three-rim cover over firebox and blank plates over the ovens. Top of best grade cast iron, 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" thick over firebox and 1\" thick over oven. Blank plates grooved around edge for draining grease into trough, which runs along front. Trough is standard equipment and has a drain on right end which flows into grease can on side of range.\n\nImproved Fire Door\u2014which fits into top, permits easy firing.\n\nOven\u2014Bottom of 12 gauge steel. Top and sides of 14 gauge steel. Extra heavy, drop, platform type doors, insulated 1\" thick. These doors have a very heavy cast door frame. Sliding in frame and supporting door when open is a heavy brass hinged to a steel rod. Door is counterbalanced by heavy coil spring concealed in hinge box. Double latch permits door to be left slightly open.\n\nGuard Rail\u2014Standard equipment. Nickel plated finish.\n\nShelves\u2014Double deck high shelf or high closet constructed of blue polished steel with polished steel trim.\n\nWater Heating Equipment\u2014Straight waterfront only.\n\nNo. 10 \"Chef Junior\" Range\n\nOne fire, one oven\n\nMeasurements\n\nCooking Surface\u201434\" x 35\"\n\nPan Top\u201430\" x 28\"\n\nHeight to Top\u201431\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\"\n\nSmoke Collar\u20148\"\n\nOven\u2014Width, 16\"; Depth, 27\"; Height, 15\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\\")\n\nFirebox for Coal or Wood\u2014\n\n18\" x 12\" x 10\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\" deep.\n\nShipping Weights\n\nRange\u20141400 lbs.\n\nDouble-deck High Shelf\u201470 lbs.\n\nHigh Closet\u201470 lbs.\n\nWaterfront\u201460 lbs.\nThese ranges have proven very satisfactory when adopted for use with automatic stokers.\n\nWhen supplied for use with stokers only the firebox and ashpit are completely lined with firebrick; also if required, the castings on the front of the fire box may be removed and the front enclosed with a blank plate. The opening for flue connection is made through end or front of firebox as required.\n\nRanges for use with stokers can be supplied with oven on either left or right side of range.\n\nOwing to the extremely high temperatures which may be developed with some stokers we are not able to guarantee range tops when used with these unless we are likewise able to supply a top of a special nichrome mixture which has a greater heat resistance than the standard tops. We, therefore, strongly recommend that all ranges for use with stokers be equipped with nichrome tops over the fireboxes.\n\nMeasurements:\n\n| No. 38 \"Chef Junior\" Range | No. 38 \"Chef Junior\" Range |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------|\n| One fire, two ovens         | One fire, three ovens     |\n| Cooking Surface             |                           |\n| 64\" x 35\"                   | 115\" x 35\"                 |\n| Depth                      |                           |\n| 20\" x 28\"                   | 20\" x 28\"                  |\n| Height to Top              |                           |\n| 31\"                         | 31\"                        |\n| Smoke Collars               |                           |\n| 6                           | 10                         |\n| Firebox for Coal or Wood    |                           |\n| W\u201426\", D\u201427\", H\u201415\u00bd\"       | W\u201426\", D\u201427\", H\u201415\u00bd\"      |\n| 18\" x 12\" x 18\u00bd\" deep       | 18\" x 12\" x 18\u00bd\" deep      |\n\nShipping Weights:\n\n| Range                       | 1800 lbs.                  |\n|                            |                            |\n| Double Deck High Shell     | 130 lbs.                   |\n| High Closet                 | 130 lbs.                   |\n| Waterfront                  | 60 lbs.                    |\n|                            |                            |\n|                            | 2400 lbs.                  |\n|                            | 190 lbs.                   |\n|                            | 190 lbs.                   |\n|                            | 60 lbs.                    |\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMinesey, Ontario,\nMay 4th, 1945.\n\nI attach herewith several letters recently received from the Rev. Mr. Soper, Principal of the Mt. Elgin Residential School which are self-explanatory in so far as they refer to repairs to the School. For convenience I have numbered these letters and commented accordingly.\n\nNO. 1 refers to the installation and repair of the water-system in the main cow barn. I have inspected it but, owing to its underground installation, failed to locate the breaks and to tear out the cement floor would be a major and quite expensive job. I therefore suggested that new pipes be installed directly in front of and along the\u738b\u8005 base of the cattle. This is the proper place for such pipes; they are then accessible at all times for inspection, and repair when breaks occur.\n\nThe estimate of $250.00, quoted by Mr. James, is much below any estimate that could be given if the floors were taken out. Mr. James is also the only mechanic in this locality available for this type of work. If the institution is to continue under its present set-up, or any other set-up in which the cow barn is to be used, the repair job is not only necessary but very essential in a barn of its type.\n\nNO. 2 - I have inspected the roof of the building referred to and find it in bad condition but not serious. It is an asphalt roof with very little slope. Such roofs are never very satisfactory and fairly constructed are usually, in part, its condition. However, a hen house is a very essential building in the make-up of general farming and the roof of any building is its main protection. By measurement it is 90' by 24', equals 216 sq. ft.; in other words it would need 22 squares of No. 3x6 Cedar Shingles @ $7.60 per sq., equals 2 squares for wastage @ $7.60 per sq., equals 24 squares @ $7.60 equals $182.40 plus 50 lbs. of shingle nails @ 6\u00a2 per lb., $3.00. Approximate cost of material, $185.40.\n\nI suggested to Mr. Soper that if the Department approved of this expenditure, would it not be possible with his farm help and the aid of the older\nboy pupils to do the work under an educational project. He thought so. If this building is to remain for any purpose at all, the request should be given consideration.\n\nNo. 3 refers to the existing condition of the latrines. Mr. Soper explains, but does not know or suggest an answer to the problem. You will have guessed, of course, that he refers to the outside privies which the pupils are made to use during the day. His letter is disgusting in itself as I feel that such places, especially in the case of this type, should not be left until they are full before emptying. To attempt to remodel or suggest an up-to-date sanitary system for an institution, housing approximately 125 persons, with its present water supply, is a major engineering job; and I would not attempt to discuss the proposition until a competent engineer had explored the possibilities. The letter, however, is submitted as received from Mr. Soper, and as the latrine complained of is not out of order, it being obvious that there is nothing to get out of order. It is merely a matter of cleaning out. There are bathrooms available in the main building at all times for the staff, and night latrines for the pupils. Before I would seriously discuss the matter I would want to know the future plans coupled with an engineer's report.\n\nNo. 4 - You must have noticed during your visits to the institution the rusted condition of the steel barn roofs. In this connection, no matter what the future plans are, they should be kept in good repair and to keep such roofs in repair is a paid job. They are badly rusted and favorable consideration should be given. However, you will note by the price quoted that it is a major job and I am not satisfied with one estimate. If you are prepared to consider the request I would suggest that tenders be asked.\n\nNo. 5 refers to the overhauling of the Staff refrigerator. I have not inspected this refrigerator but Mr. Soper reports that it is now out of order.\n\nThe various jobs are submitted for your consideration. I have endeavoured to cover the items and report accordingly. If favourable to any one, I would suggest that the money allotted be earmarked for each particular job accordingly.\n\nI await your comments with interest.\n\nGeo. W.

Regardless of what the future plans may be for the Mount Elgin School, the Agent feels that the barns should be kept in good repair, as valuable use can be made of them. They are badly rusted at the present time and the only method to improve them would be to paint them. There is approximately 56,000 square feet of painting required. Without being requested to do so, the Principal secured a quotation from Mr. Reid, Brantford, Ont., who offers to supply the material and do the necessary work for an amount of $1,420.00.\n\nI believe that the barn roofs should be preserved, but at the same time it would be preferable to have additional tenders before awarding a contract.

Down, Indian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nI have your voucher No. 93, requesting $50.00 towards the salary of the night watchman at the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School for the month of May, 1945.\n\nAs you are aware, we usually make an allowance for the services of a night watchman for the period November 1 to April 30, only. However, owing to the cold weather experienced this year, we have decided to pay the allowance for the month of May, 1945, but our action in this regard is not to be taken as a precedent for future years.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, June 12, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Soper:\n\nLast month Indian Agent Down forwarded us a letter which you had received, dated April 24, 1945, quoting a price of $1,420.00 for painting the roof of the barns and outbuildings at the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School. I think the signature is \"Wm. J. Reid, Brantford, Ont.\" In view of the expenditure involved, we had to submit the matter to the Minister's office, but Mr. Reid's address is so indefinite that they do not know how to send a letter to him, which will have to be done in order to obtain additional information regarding the work he is prepared to do for the sum quoted.\n\nOn receipt of this letter, it would be appreciated if you would wire me the correct initials and the post office address of Mr. Reid.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Seaver\n\nWith reference to the writer's recent call on you, we have submitted our report on the condition of your various heating and power units.\n\nDORMITORY BUILDING\n\nA 60 HP Smokeless Portable, LEONARD Firebox Boiler, #23188, which is used for heating the above building, is in relatively good condition, with the exception that on the lower left front between the door opening and rivet seam on the inside of firebox there is some external wasting of the plate which should be built up by welding, or welding on a re-inforcing plate. The extent of this repair cannot be determined until workmen are actually on the job, but we do not believe it would be extensive. This was formerly a wood fired, down draft boiler, under which had been installed a stoker. Usually when a stoker is installed under this type boiler, the upper or water gates are removed by cutting them off and welding the ends. It might be advisable to have this done when the welder is making the other repairs.\n\nInstalled, adjacent to this boiler, is a 10 HP Flueless Upright Boiler #34386, which required a new smoke hood which will cost $5.00.\n\nWe wish to call your attention to the fact that the roof, or the drain pipe, is leaking and causing considerable rusting of this boiler, which is not a satisfactory condition.\n\nSCHOOL BUILDING\n\nIn the basement of the above school is a cast iron Burney-Oxford boiler #70-B, equipped with an Empire Stoker. This boiler is an old round cast iron boiler in very poor condition and not suitable for stoker firing. We recommend that it be replaced by a modern steel boiler.\n\nYours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 620H, file 468-5, part 10)\nThe stoker appeared to be in good condition, but poorly installed; and whether a new boiler is purchased or not, we recommend that a competent stoker man be called in to check on this installation. The automatic control system for the stoker should be re-arranged. A circulating pump would be beneficial on a water job of this size.\n\nWe could furnish you with one of our W-130 Leonard-Calor Boilers, built for a working pressure of 150 per square inch, under government Interprovincial Regulations governing boilers of this type, with our usual castings and mountings, as described on page 2 of our catalogue #970-D, for the sum of FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-ONE DOLLARS .........................$551.00 F.O.B. the curb your premises. Government Sales Tax included.\n\nWe would place this boiler on a prepared foundation, free access provided, for the sum of THIRTY-THREE DOLLARS .........................$33.00\n\nIn the Laundry is installed a 20 H.P. H.R.T. Leonard Boiler. This boiler appeared to be in excellent condition except that the front arch should be replaced. The extent of this work cannot be determined until the workmen are on the job. You also require a new set of wood grates for this boiler, the price of which would be Eighteen Dollars ($18.00), F.O.B. London, Government Sales Tax extra.\n\nWe believe the above is a fair picture of the condition of your heating units, and if we can be of any further assistance to you please do not hesitate to get in touch with us.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.

Leonard & Sons on this boiler reads as follows:\n\n\"It is in relatively good condition, with the exception that on the lower left front between the door opening and rivet seam on the inside of firebox there is some external wasting of the plate which should be built up by welding, or welding on a reinforcing plate. The extent of this repair cannot be determined until workmen are actually on the job, but we do not believe it would be extensive.\"\n\nPlease arrange to have this work done.\n\nYou should also arrange to have the stoker in the basement checked by a competent man. The report from E. Leonard & Sons shows that the automatic control system for this stoker should be re-arranged.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSeptember 5, 1945\n\nMr. G. W. Down  \nIndian Agent  \nMuncey, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Down:\n\nI have your letter of September 3 in reference to estimates submitted by the E. Leonard Co. of London. I am glad that the wood grates and the new smoke wood have been approved.\n\nThe other estimates for repairs to the steam boilers of the main building, and the furnace for the school building are absolute essentials. I have tried repeatedly to get repairs done before the cold weather sets in. The E. Leonard Co. is the only firm who will make any promise whatsoever to have this work completed in time. I cannot accept responsibility for the health and well-being of students and staff of this Institution unless these repairs, as submitted by the E. Leonard Co., are made with the least possible delay.\n\nI very sincerely hope that you will bring this matter to the attention of the department concerned at your earliest convenience, in order that we may not suffer unduly by any further delay.\n\nOn August 9, I submitted an estimate for painting of barns by the Better Paint Company, Scotland, Ontario. This estimate was secured at considerable trouble, and has my hearty endorsement. In a letter from the Department, file 7-0-5, June 12, 1945, I was asked to supply an estimate, and was not able at that time to complete the transaction.\n\nIf, for any reason, Mr. Campbell's estimate is not approved, and the property has to go another winter without painting and repairs, very serious harm will result to the buildings. I would, therefore, once more urge that this estimate be approved as early as possible.\n\nI am enclosing herewith requisition for school material which was not sent in by Miss Sibbald because of her illness, and having to go to the sanatorium at Byron.\n\nI remain yours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 10)\nMuncey, Ontario,\nSeptember 11th, 1945.\n\nI submit, herewith attached, a letter received from the Rev. Mr. Soper, Principal of the Mt. Elgin Residential School, which is self-explanatory.\n\nMr. Soper is quite annoyed and requests that I write again in connection with the various repairs. I explained to him that the Minister's Office had endeavoured to get in touch with Mr. Reid, of Brantford, without avail; also, that other firms had been approached without success. I also mentioned, as pointed out in your letter of August 31st, that later consideration would be given to installation of a new boiler.\n\nWith regard to the barn roofs, a later estimate has been submitted.\n\nHowever, I cannot do better than submit Mr. Soper's letter for your consideration.\n\nGeo.

This shipment was not received by the school and considerable correspondence was carried on between the R.C.A.F. and myself relative to the shipment.\n\nI have consistently refused to sign the R.C.A.F. receipt for the goods which consisted of \"Khaki Trousers Sizes Mixed\".\n\nThis shipment, without doubt, was taken to the Agency buildings and unpacked there as I personally saw the trousers in the store room although Mr. Down professed ignorance of the shipping bill.\n\nI have a file of correspondence dated March 23, 1944 to December 4, 1944 relative to the matter and have refused to sign the receipts because the shipment was not received by the school.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, 19th September, 1945.\n\nMr. R.

However, this is his suggestion and is submitted for your consideration.\n\nI feel that this matter is too complicated, and involves too many questions, to be intelligently discussed by correspondence.

Last year we had one hundred students, giving us an income of $17,500. From this I paid to my staff eleven in all and including my own salary, $10,000 leaving $7,500. From this I had to feed, clothe and light and heat one hundred children for ten months, some of them for twelve months. This means that I have to earn the balance on the farm.\n\nIn time past when big boys and big girls came to the school this was possible. Today when we have 45 children under ten and only 3 who are sixteen three fifteen and five thirteen it is an impossibility. I have just paid out over six hundred dollars for repairs to one tractor. These wee children have to earn that. There is no other source from which it can come. If I were to publish that fact some one would be hurt.\n\nJust now we need potato peelers, bread slicers. But we are told that this is impossible. I want to say that something else is impossible. It is impossible for babies of this age to feed, clothe and wash for themselves. I cannot afford to employ help.\n\nThe War Assets people have abundance of the things we need and need desperately. But we cannot get\nthem. We have not the money. But the children need just what can be obtained, and without cost, if we could touch the magic spring.\n\nChildren have to go out to the barns to the poultry house, out to do chores but I cannot afford proper protection for them.\n\nWe need a dental clinic and a throat clinic. Numbers of these children come from back settlements where medical aid is impossible.\n\nThe long winter evenings are coming. We have no games equipment. We need a moving picture projector. Just think of having one hundred and twenty children to amuse seven nights a week for ten months of the year. We need equipment.\n\nAfter I pay salaries I have just 20 cents a day from the grant to feed and clothe and warm and light the children. On top of that we have to pay all farm equipment repairs and transportation.\n\nI hope that this is something in the line of what you needed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd.) S. H. Soper\nThe Senate\nCanada\n\nOttawa, Ontario\nOctober 12th, 1945.\n\nMr. Ford Pratt,\nSecretary to the Minister of\nMines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nDear Ford:\n\n........ deals with a different\n......... matter.\n\nI am also enclosing a letter from Reverend\nS.H. Soper, Principal of the Mount Elgin Indian Residential\nSchool at Muncey, Ontario. This letter was written to\nMr. J.C. Bush who is now in charge of farm operations at\nthis school, so that I would have full details as to how\nthis school is conducted. The report given to me is to\nthe effect that the buildings are in a serious state of\nrepair and in need of considerable money to conduct the\nnecessary improvements. As I was not sure whether your\nDepartment, Indian Affairs or Public Works were respons-\nible for this, I am sending the letter along so that\nyou will fully understand the present situation. I would\nappreciate any information you can give me.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd.) W. H. Taylor\nOttawa, October 18, 1948.\n\nDear Senator Taylor:\n\nI desire to refer to that portion of your letter of October 17 in which you request information regarding the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School, as outlined in a letter received by Mr. J. C. Fish from Reverend J. H. Cooper, Principal of the School.\n\nThe Mount Elgin Residential School is a very old building, having been originally built approximately 75 years ago. In the Fall of 1943 a survey was made of our educational requirements in southwestern Ontario, and at that time the opinion was expressed, by the educationists whom we had engaged, that the Mohawk Institute at Brantford could handle all the Indian children from the reserves of southwestern Ontario requiring institutional care. The committee further recommended that the Mount Elgin Residential School be closed. However, the United Church authorities, under whose auspices this school has always been conducted, expressed a desire to have the school remain in operation for a further period, for the purpose of ascertaining if it was serving a real necessity.\n\nIn view of the age of the building, it is impossible to keep it in first-class condition, but the Department has endeavoured to keep up the repairs so far as our funds will permit.\n\nI note that the Principal refers to lack of pupils. In the first place, it has always been our policy to have the Church interested recruit pupils,\n\nHonourable W. H. Taylor,\nThe Senate,\nOttawa, Ont.\nwith the co-operation of the Indian agent. In the second place, as intimated in the first part of this letter, this school is not actually needed at the present time, as the number of children requiring institutional care has decreased.\n\nI can assure you that departmental officials will continue to give sympathetic consideration to the requirements of the Mount Elgin School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, October 18, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Pratt's memorandum of October 16, enclosing communication from Senator W. H. Taylor, with reference to the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School.\n\nAs requested in that memorandum, I enclose draft reply to the Senator.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\n\nIndian Affairs.

W. Down. The fact of the matter is that trying to work with the result, we have in residence 75 girls, many of whom are under 10 years of age, and new to the institution. These are all under the supervision of one matron. To say that these are impracticable people is not strictly according to the facts. There are physical limits to the whereabouts of any one person, and no amount of teaching and instruction in the proper use of the toilets will overcome the inadequacy of our water supply. To meet the desperate situation, we have placed ordinary scrub pails in the dormitories for the use of these little children. That may be impracticable, but it is meeting the situation, causing, however, needless work of a very unpleasant character. Now all this may not be printable, but printable or not, it is the fact.\n\nThere are a great many things about conditions around this building, and conditions under which little children have to live, which if printed and publicized would cause such a furore of indignation that someone would have to take cognizance of it, and that immediately.\n\nIt is impracticable, but also printable that we have here a great number of little children who need attention given to tonsils, adenoids and teeth. We are facing a long winter season, when all of these ills will take their toll of the health of the children, and consequently place an almost impossible burden upon our inadequate staff. I would like some practical suggestions from your department in this matter.\n\nI would also like a clear definition from the Department as to what repairs and equipment may be charged to the Department, and what repairs and equipment must be borne by the labour of 10 and 11 year old boys. In a communication from your department sometime during the summer, I was informed that material for a hay-rack could not be granted by the Department because, forsooth, the wagon upon which the hay rack was to be placed was not the property of the Department. I had to save a crop. Every member of my staff works long hours under most adverse conditions, and the refusal of the Department to even pay for the material to make this hay-rack has brought this whole matter to a head. I wish to say that it is impracticable but it is nevertheless printable, that 6 and 10 year old boys should have to labour in order to pay for equipment to save the harvest.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI am convinced that nothing less than a complete and thorough investigation into the relationship between the school management, and the Department of Indian Affairs will make for efficiency. It is not asked that any educational institution pay, out of its own labour, for essential equipment. Why, therefore, should there be any distinction in the case of this school? I hope that in the very near future, we may have a clear understanding, in order that the staff may be able to give attention to the moral and academic side of the work.

Soper.\nOttawa, October 31, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. [Name],\n\nYour letter of October 15th has been passed on to me for personal consideration and reply.\n\nIt is, I feel, unnecessary to state that I appreciate very fully the conditions existing at the Mount Elgin School. These conditions have been to me and, I feel sure, have been to the Secretaries of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church, a source of worry and annoyance ever since I entered the department nine years ago.\n\nYou refer in the concluding paragraph of your letter to a thoroughgoing investigation into the relationship between the school management and the Indian Affairs Branch. In this connection, I can only state that a thorough investigation by representatives of the department and a representative of the United Church was held a few years ago. Certain recommendations were made at that time. Inasmuch, however, as the operation of the Mount Elgin Residential School appears to be related to the operation of the Mohawk Institute, it has not been possible for this reason and for a number of others to seriously consider the recommendations made by the members of the Committee of Inquiry. A few weeks ago, we learned that it is the intention of the New England Company of London, England, to send over a representative to study and report upon the future of the Mohawk Institute. It is my hope that immediately following this investigation we shall be in a position to work out a worthwhile educational program based upon the needs of the Indian population of Southwestern Ontario. In the meantime and until such a program is worked out, the operation and administration of the Mount Elgin Institute will require the exercise of the utmost patience and forbearance on the part of departmental officials, the Board of Home Missions of the United Church and the Principal in charge. I am frankly of the opinion\n\n....that it is a\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 10)\nthat it is a sheer waste of money to undertake worthwhile repairs at the present school. I have long since reached the conclusion that the school should be either closed or re-built. However, this is a matter with respect to which there may be a difference of opinion. In any event, it is my intention to ask Doctor Dorsey to visit Ottawa just as soon as he can conveniently do so. At which time, I shall be glad to discuss the matter very fully with him and with the Minister.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend S. H.

Roy\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Roy:\n\nI have just received your letter of October 26. We have now here in residence 124 children, and there are several more to come. This places a great responsibility upon our physical and spiritual resources. We are indeed glad to have so many little folk, and I am convinced that my present staff has the qualifications of character and ability needed to cope with the present situation. I am indeed fortunate to have such an exceptional group of fine people in the school. Nothing but the good hand of God upon us could have brought together such a group with such fine qualities as they have. It will take time, and a great deal of patience to develop in these little folk the qualities and abilities needed to fit them for life after they leave school.\n\nFrom my short experience with the people of the various reserves, served by this school, I am convinced that they have confidence in the staff of the school, and in spite of other attractions and advantages, they are continuing to send to us such large numbers of small ones.\n\nI want to thank you once again for your continued and deep interest in us, and I wish to assure you that now that I am assured that this school has a large place in your plans for the future, we will do all in our power to keep the buildings and equipment in such condition as will tide us over the present emergency.\n\nWe desperately need additional members on our staff, in order to keep up with the needs of so many little children, and I hope that within the very near future, ways and means will be found to enable us to have such an increased staff.\n\nI will be glad to co-operate in any way possible to bring about any improvement that is possible in the present situation.\n\nI remain\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Doctor Dorey feels, and I agree with him, that the department has at its disposal sufficient information to decide on a definite policy and that in fairness to the Church authorities this policy should be clearly outlined and submitted to the Church at the earliest possible date. He and I are both agreed that it would be a sheer waste of public funds to undertake extensive or substantial repairs to the present building.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances, I am recommending to the Minister that a four-room consolidated school, together with a principal's residence, be built at this Agency just as soon as funds for this purpose can be provided. The new school, in my judgment, should cease to operate at the end of the present school year, June 30th, and that only the repairs necessary for the comfort of the principal and the staff should be undertaken at this time.\n\nIt is just possible that a shortage of skilled labour and an equally acute shortage of lumber and other building materials may prevent the erection of the school we have in mind at this time.\nin mind at any time during the next fiscal year. If the school is not built, provision will have to be made for the care of a number of orphan children and children from disrupted and broken homes now enrolled at the institutions. Indeed, this provision will have to be made in any case. This provision can only be made after a careful survey of the Indian homes at the Agency has been undertaken and perhaps a survey of Indian homes at various and other points from which pupils are recruited. Doctor Loney and I feel that with a small Government grant, plus the monthly allowances for which provision is made in the Family Allowance Act, little difficulty should be experienced in securing suitable homes for orphan children.\n\nYou will have to discuss these and other relevant matters with Doctor Loney, who will also visit Munsey on the 23rd instant. A great deal of consideration will have to be given to the type of school necessary to meet the needs of the Indians. The selection of a site and the availability of a dependable water supply are matters of utmost importance. It is just possible that after your visit you may recommend that an additional educational survey may have to be undertaken at the Agency to work out a well-balanced educational program. The condition of the reserve roads is a matter that might be discussed with the Agent in view of the fact that transportation facilities will have to be provided if a consolidated school is established.\n\nDoctor Loney was of the opinion that the management of the program we have in mind might be withheld from the Indians for the time being at least. I am not at all sure that we can successfully do this; however, this is a matter you can discuss with him at the time of your visit.\n\nI am sending a copy of this memorandum to Doctor Loney for his information.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

McDonagh for the amount just mentioned.\n\nWith reference to the items \"Plumber 16 hrs $20.00 - Helper 16 hrs $12.00 - Foreman 4 hrs $6.00\" the rate per hour and the exact dates on which the mentioned work was done should be shown on the account. Receipts should also be attached for the two items of transportation of $9.60 each. Either receipts should be attached from the Railroad Company or a statement attached showing how these amounts were reached. If these men came from London in a car they possibly came together and it would not be necessary for each of them to have an account for transportation.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nPURCHASE ORDER\n\nOttawa Dec. 8/46\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING MATERIALS AND CHARGE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES.\n\nSHIP TO: Already received\n\nFOR: QUOTATION OF\n\nRENDER A SEPARATE INVOICE FOR EACH ORDER AND SEND COPIES AFTER SHIPMENT\n\nTO: Already received\n\nQUANTITY DESCRIPTION UNIT TOTAL\n\n175 Purchased for Mount Elgin Indian Residential School panes window glass, various sizes ranging from 8 x 10 to 39 x 34 $20.00\n\nAs per invoice dated Oct. 31/46\n\nVoucher No. 892\n\nCERTIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 29 OF THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE AND AUDIT ACT 1931.\n\nTO BE RETURNED TO HEAD OF BRANCH\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n| Terms Not 30 days | Ship Via | Your Order No | Our Order No |\n|-------------------|----------|---------------|--------------|\n| 6 lts 26 x 7 Hobbs double | 1 01 | 6 06 |\n| 1 lts 29 x 34 Hobbs double | 1 01 | 4 96 |\n| 2 lts 34 x 34 Hobbs double | 3 50 | 7 20 |\n| 6 lts 34 x 34 Hobbs double | 4 20 | 25 20 |\n| 5 lts 34 x 14 Hobbs double | 1 56 | 7 80 |\n| 4 lts 36 x 14 Hobbs double | 1 62 | 6 48 |\n| 5 lts 34 x 28 Hobbs double | 3 36 | 16 90 |\n| 3 lts 32 x 24 Hobbs double | 2 56 | 7 68 |\n| 3 lts 30 x 24 Hobbs double | 2 86 | 6 88 |\n| 1 lt 30 x 14 Hobbs double | 1 38 | 5 52 |\n| 4 lts 26 x 14 Hobbs double | 1 42 | 5 68 |\n| 4 lts 26 x 12 Hobbs double | 10 18 | 52 14 |\n\n50% discount\n\n| 2 lts 26 x 14 Hobbs double | 1 38 | 5 52 |\n| 1 lt 26 x 17 Hobbs double | 1 62 | 9 72 |\n| 1 lt 26 x 7 Hobbs double | 1 01 |\n| 4 lts 14 x 14 Hobbs double | 2 32 |\n| 30 lts 10 x 17 Hobbs double | 27 00 |\n| 14 lts 10 x 13 Hobbs double | 5 04 |\n| 10 lts 10 x 8 Hobbs double | 3 40 |\n| 4 lts 9 x 9 Hobbs double | 1 0 |\n| 20 lts 15 x 12 Hobbs double | 25 00 |\n\n50% discount\n\nthank you\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to: Hobbs Glass Ltd.,\nAddress: London,\nOntario.\n\n1945 DATE SERVICE AMOUNT\n\nNov. 26 To payment of glass used at the Mt.

On November 21st, we received a memorandum from the Company stating that they had shipped the boiler to your school. However, the account covering the cost of the boiler has not yet reached us. If you have this account and the boiler has been received please certify the account and forward same to this office. If the account has been mislaid I would appreciate it if you would obtain a duplicate which you should certify and forward for payment. Your immediate attention to this matter would be appreciated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, March 21, 1946.\n\nRev. S.H. Soper, Principal, Mount Elgin Res. School,\nMuncy, Ontario.\n\nOn October 16th, 1945, we issued Purchase Order No. 5953 to the Globe Furniture Company Limited, Waterloo, Ontario for eighteen desks for the Mount Elgin Residential School.\n\nAs yet we have not received an account covering the cost. If you have the account and the desks were received you should certify the account and forward for payment. If the account has been mislaid please obtain a duplicate which you certify and forward to this office. Your immediate attention to this matter would be appreciated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIMPORTANT\u2014Caution Notice\nPLEASE READ CAREFULLY\n\nSchool Desks\n\nACCEPTANCE OF SHIPMENT AND BREAKAGE\n\nThe goods covered by the attached invoice were received by the Railroad Company as having been received by them in good condition and properly packed. Before accepting the shipment from the Railroad Company, the consignee should make sure that all articles enumerated on the bill of lading are included in the shipment and in good condition. To protect yourself against loss or damage in transit, check the shipment carefully with your bill of lading, noting the number of crates or packages in their condition. Any parts broken by the Railroad Company will be duplicated at our expense.\n\nFirst\u2014The consignee must not give the Railroad Company a clear receipt for the complete shipment if there is any shortage, breakage or damage of any kind. In the event there is any shortage, breakage or damage of the goods delivered, the consignee can give a receipt for the goods if the railroad agent will make a notation on the freight bill indicating the amount of the shortage or the extent and nature of the damage. This freight bill must be mailed to us.\n\nIf the breakage or damage is concealed and not discovered until the goods are unpacked, notify the agent of the Railroad Company by letter or telephone to call immediately and examine the shipment. The carrier is equally responsible for \"Concealed Damage\" as for visible damage and when notified as suggested it places the burden of proof upon the carrier. When you have given the Railroad Company notice in the manner suggested, mail us your bill of lading and paid freight bill.\n\nSecond\u2014When there is shortage, breakage or damage in an express shipment, request your Express Agent to furnish you receipt showing the condition in which the shipment was delivered to you.\n\nThird\u2014When you report shortage or breakage to us, enumerate fully and describe clearly the parts you desire replaced. In ordering standards for School Desks specify size and whether right or left, which is always determined as you sit at the desk. It is well to supplement your order by mentioning the pattern mark you will find on the pieces. If several styles of desks, be sure to specify the style for which the parts are desired, particularly if wooden parts are being ordered. Care in making your order clear and complete will permit us to give you immediate service.\n\nFourth\u2014All claims for shortage, breakage or damage must be made within Thirty Days and you must provide us with the necessary papers to enable us to file claim against the Railroad or Express Company, as explained in Paragraphs No. 1 and No. 2. Otherwise claim will not be allowed.\n\nFifth\u2014We are not responsible for parts broken through carelessness of drayman hauling the goods or your workmen in assembling and installing.\n\nSTORAGE\n\nThe desks manufactured under this contract were constructed from thoroughly air seasoned and properly kiln-dried material and were in perfect condition when shipment left our factory. They were stored under conditions that permitted no variation regarding local atmospheric conditions. Under no condition store this furniture even temporarily in a damp room or basement nor in a partly completed structure where building material, such as plaster, calcimine, paint, etc., may be thrown over the crates. Store in a cool, well ventilated room of normal uniform temperature. The crates containing woods should rest on their ends and all crates and boxes be elevated above floor a few inches to allow free air circulation under and around them.\n\nCLEANING AND POLISHING\n\nDo not attempt to clean or polish the woodwork with linseed oil, turpentine, undiluted benzine, gasoline, alcohol, or anything of that kind. These materials are varnish solvents which will remove the finish from the wood; nor do we recommend any one of the various furniture polishes on the market. The following is a very good cleaner and polish, the constituents of which can usually be obtained in any paint or drug store for a few cents:\n\n3 parts New England Oil\n1 part Benzine.\n\nMix thoroughly before using.\n\nMoisten a rag with this solution, apply sparingly to the surface and immediately rub dry with a clean dry cloth. Cheesecloth is recommended. The most effective result is obtained through the rubbing, not through excessive use of the solution.\n\nN. B.\u2014We maintain a SERVICE DEPARTMENT for the purpose of giving our customers all possible information and rendering any service to insure the proper installation and care of our products. If you have any difficulty with the installation and desire further information your request will receive immediate attention. In writing please refer to the order number you will find stamped on the invoice and other papers.\n\nGlobe Furniture Company Limited\nWaterloo, Ontario\n\nForm 218-5m-M.P.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the event there is any shortage, or if any part of the shipment is damaged, the consignee must give a receipt for the goods if the Railroad Agent or Trucking Agent will make a notation on the freight bill indicating the amount of the shortage or the extent and nature of the damage. The original freight bill must be mailed to us.\n\nIf the breakage or damage is concealed and not discovered until the goods are unpacked, notify the Agent of the Railroad Company or Trucking Company by letter or telephone to call immediately and examine the shipment. The carrier is equally responsible for \"Concealed Damage\" as for visible damage and when notified as suggested it places the burden of proof upon the carrier. When you have given the Railroad Company or Trucking Company notice in the manner suggested, mail us your bill of lading and paid freight receipt.\n\n2nd. When there is shortage, breakage or damage in an express shipment, request your Express Agent to furnish you receipt showing the condition in which the shipment was delivered to you.\n\n3rd. When you report shortage or breakage to us, enumerate fully and describe clearly the parts you desire replaced.\n\nNOTE: In ordering standards for School Desks specify size and whether right or left, which is always determined as you sit in the desk. It is well to supplement your order by mentioning the pattern mark you will find on the inside. If several styles of desks, be sure to specify the style for which the parts are desired, particularly if wooden parts are being ordered. Care in making your order clear and complete will permit us to give immediate service.\n\n4th. All claims for shortage, breakage or damage must be made within thirty days and you must provide us with the necessary papers to enable us to file claim against the Railroad, Express or Trucking Company, as explained in paragraphs No. 1 and No. 2. Otherwise claim will not be allowed.\n\n5th. We are not responsible for parts broken through carelessness of drayman hauling the goods or your workmen in assembling and installing.\n\nSTORAGE\n\nThe furniture manufactured under this contract was constructed from thoroughly air seasoned and properly kiln-dried material and was in perfect condition when shipment left our factory. This does not mean that parts will remain perfect regardless of local atmospheric conditions. Under no condition store this furniture even temporarily in a damp room or basement nor in a partly completed structure where building material, such as plaster, calcimine, paint, etc., may be thrown over the crates. Store in a dry, well ventilated room of normal uniform temperature.\n\nN.B. We maintain a SERVICE DEPARTMENT for the purpose of giving our customers all possible information and rendering any service to insure the proper installation and care of our products. If you have any difficulty in the installation and desire further information, your request will receive immediate attention. In writing please refer to the order number you will find marked on the invoice and other papers.\n\nTHE GLOBE FURNITURE COMPANY LIMITED\nWATERLOO, ONTARIO\nOur Order No. 33355\n\nYour Order No. 5983\nFile No. 60943-15-38\nSold to Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nc/o Mr. H.

We favour the latter site because there is an excellent location available and, in addition, we have an opportunity for teaching agricultural subjects to the pupils.\n\nThe only difficulty with this site is that the road from Nuneys to the new site is reported to be in very bad condition at certain periods of the year. The road is one mile long and it may be necessary to put it in condition to be used at all periods of the year. However, this work will be necessary, as we expect to be driving the children to the new school and, consequently, a year around road will be required.\n\nWe interviewed Mr. T. S. Caldwell, District Engineer, Ontario Highways Department, London, with a view to obtaining some assistance from the Provincial Government. Mr. Caldwell promised to inspect the road and let us have an estimate of what it would cost to put it into proper condition. When visiting Mr. Caldwell, we also met Mr. Marshall, Chief Engineer, Ontario Highways Department, and Mr. Marshall instructed Mr. Caldwell to forward his report to him so that a decision might be made regarding what portion of the cost could be met by the Ontario Highways.\n\nWith reference to the erection of the new school, Inspector Arnell obtained the following information:\n\n(a) Foundation - Graham and Graham, London, Ontario, are prepared to shovel out the excavation in three days' time. They will require 2 weeks' notice before we desire to have the work completed.\n\n(b) Building Foreman - Charles Lady, Builder, Rodney, Ont., is available. He has an excellent reputation as a builder and his services can be secured within the next two weeks. He has built many homes and one church at Rodney. He can read blue prints and take full charge. Indian helpers, many of whom are competent carpenters, are available, as well as other Indian labour.\n\n(c) Material - This can likely be secured within two months' time. It may be necessary to apply to the Timber Controller for priority. Arrangements were made with a qualified man to prepare a list of the materials and forward this to the Department by June 1.\n\nIn view of the above information, secured by Mr.\nArnold, I would appreciate it if we could receive permission to proceed. The sooner we start purchasing the material, the sooner we can commence building.\n\nI might also mention that both Indian Agent Down and the newly appointed farm instructor have had considerable experience in erecting buildings and will be in a position to supervise the erection of the school and keep the Department fully informed.\n\nPhilip Maclean,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, May 30, 1946.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMR. JACKSON\n\nFor: Erection of four-room school, Cariboo Agency\n\nI am sending forward herewith a memorandum dated May 29th, received by me from Mr. Thelan.\n\nIt would be appreciated if we could have from the Minister the approval to proceed with the construction of this school.\n\nDirector,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 10)\nOttawa, June 3, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMr. W. S. Arnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Ontario, interviewed you about 10 days ago with reference to securing your services as foreman for a new school we are erecting in the Caradoc Agency, near Munsey, Ontario. We hope to begin construction of this building within the next two or three weeks and either Mr. Arnell or myself will get in touch with you later.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Charles Ludy,\nBuilder,\nRedney, Ontario.\nOttawa, June 3, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Caldwell:\n\nI desire to refer to the interview of Mr. W. S. Arneil, Inspector of Indian Agencies, and myself, with you and Mr. Marshall on May 23rd.\n\nHave you found it possible to inspect the road about which we spoke to you? If so, I would appreciate hearing from you, as we hope to start construction of the new school before the end of this month.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. T. S. Caldwell,\nDistrict Engineer,\nDepartment of Highways,\nLondon, Ontario.\nOttawa, June 3, 1946.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nMr. W. S. Arnell, Inspector of Indian Agencies for the province of Ontario, interviewed your firm about 10 days ago with reference to modelling out the excavation for a new school in the Caradoc Indian Agency, near Muncey, Ontario.\n\nWe hope to begin the erection of this building within the next two or three weeks and I am notifying you to that effect. We will get in touch with you later.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMessrs.

(RG 10, Volume 6208, file J68-5, part 10)\nOttawa, June 24, 1946.\n\nMr. George W. Down, Indian Agent,\nMuncey, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's visit to the Caradoc Agency last week, regarding the proposed new school, I wish to confirm the following arrangements:\n\n1. You can secure the services of a surveyor to properly lay out the site. It is understood that the services of Mr. John Findlay, St. Thomas, Ontario, are available, and that his services will only be required for a very short time.\n\n2. Arrangements for the cement mixer and a competent man to operate it are in your hands and you will, no doubt, arrange for this when it is required.\n\n3. Nails and other hardware needed may be secured when and where available. I understand that these are in short supply at present and will have to be purchased wherever available.\n\n4. I am informed that in company with Mr. Phelan you interviewed Mr. D. D. Crawford, Dalasard, Ontario, with reference to carpenters and brick-layers when needed. I am also informed that an endeavour was made to meet Mr. Ed. Bateman, Mount Brydges, but you did not succeed in meeting him. Both these gentlemen should be consulted before white brick-layers or carpenters are employed, but if they are unable to supply competent tradesmen when the work is ready to proceed, either yourself or the Foreman, Mr. Charles Judy, may make necessary arrangements.\n\nThe gentlemen mentioned in paragraph 4 should also be consulted with a view to having them nominate electrical contractors from whom quotations may be obtained for wiring the new school.\n6. As you are aware, Mr. Charles Ludy, Rodney, Ontario, has been appointed as Foreman and you should feel free to use his services in connection with arrangements for the new school so as to relieve your office. Before the actual construction of the school commences, you should let me know if you have been successful in obtaining the extra clerk in your office. If not, we will have to make other arrangements for handling the paylists.\n\n7. Indian labour should be used as far as possible.\n\n8. For your information, I enclose copies of letters that have been forwarded to the firm whom Mr. Phelan and yourself interviewed.\n\nBernard F.

Each set includes the following:\n\n(a) Blueprints comprising 7 sheets of working drawings\n(b) Contract Agreement\n(c) General Conditions\n(d) Labour Conditions\n(e) General Specifications\n\nI think these plans and documents are along the lines of our discussion last week and I hope this information will meet your requirements.\n\nSchedule \"A\" Forms covering this type of four classroom Indian day school, were forwarded you in January last by the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch. If additional schools of this type are proposed, Form \"A\" will be submitted covering them.

As other four roomed day schools are decided upon, Schedule \"A\" forms should be forwarded to the Department of Reconstruction and Supply to cover these buildings and reference should be made in the covering letter to that Department to the standard plans and specifications now being sent to the Public Projects Branch.\n\nThe present arrangement is based on a discussion I had with Mr. Fairlie last week and for this reason I have forwarded him direct the duplicate sets of plans, specifications, etcetera. If in future you would like to transmit such plans direct from your office, please let me know and I will be very glad to forward you the necessary documents as they are completed.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa July 5 1946\n\nDISCUSS WITH LUDY ADVISABILITY OF USING CINDER BLOCKS\n\nFROM THE FOOTING -stop- THIS WILL ALLOW AIR SPACE FOR LIVING ROOMS AND\nAVOID NECESSITY OF SHUTTING BACK -stop- IT WOULD ALSO SAVE LABOUR FOR FOUNDATION\nAND BRICK LAYERS -stop- IT WOULD MAKE IT FASTER CONSTRUCTION -stop- IF LUDY\nWISHES TO HAVE US COLLECT ABOUT THESE P.M.

Elgin Institute, I have been running into difficulties; difficulties which should, and could, have been avoided if only persons would do their work and not meddle with other people's.\n\nI am annoyed and have reason to be when my work is troubled and I have to go begging for workmen because of a suggested change of plans which, by the way, had to be discarded. I have been quite concerned and it is only by grace and the very mild weather that saved us from what could have developed into a disastrous break of the entire system, and a major repair job which could have closed the entire building. The plumber attributes any delay caused to a change from the original plan, which we had both gone into very thoroughly and he is very definite in advising that he is not waiting on any\nperson, which includes the Government, when they do not know what they want. Even the pipes, which were mentioned, are black pipes and cannot be used for underground work. However, after many attempts, by telephone and personal contact, I have been able to smooth out the differences and I have the plumber on the job and have advised him to proceed in his best workmanship manner and take instructions only from my Office which I feel was your intention when you were here.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo.

Elgin School.\n\nInspection reveals two boilers, one of very large capacity capable of heating the entire main building; the other of much smaller capacity used in the laundry. Both units are built in and supplied by the Leonard Boiler Company, of London, Ontario, but neither have the capacity rating or number stamped in. Both, I believe, are in need of repairs but, owing to the fact that the Leonard Boiler Company is a big concern in London, the repair problem would not create difficulty and, providing the cost of dismantling, trucking and reinstalling were not too high, the smaller of the two might take care of Rev. Zimmerman's proposition.\n\nI have been in contact with Col. Randle and discussed the matter with him. I have also written the Leonard Boiler Company with a view of ascertaining the capacity which, if available, I will forward to him. As far as I am aware, in the present set up of things at the Caradoc agency, we have no use for either unit; and if the Rev. Mr.\nZimmerman can arrange for dismantling and haulage at costs less than a new small auxiliary boiler which, I understand, is his requirement; I think that it can well be transferred.\n\nI wish you would keep this question in mind so that we can discuss it further at the coming conference in Toronto.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo.

As you have by the $2,500 recently paid the Mission Rooms on account of extras on this New building made the Department the owner of all. Would it not be wise for you to increase the amount of Insurance and include these extras. You have the cost of each item. I judge that what is called a Blanket insurance would be the best covering the building and fittings, but not the furnishings which are still the property of the Missionary Society and we will keep a risk on all furnishings till such time as the Department may take possession of all.\n\nNow about the old building. I understand the Department has a right to it still, but having vacated it as we have, unless some arrangement is made with the company in the event of fire the risk of loss will be valid.\n\nWe use the old building for storage of roots, fruit, meat and the pupil's personal clothing.\n\nFor the purpose of the reconstruction of said building, which will be an item on the Report, I have now with something in preparation about the same as stated above.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We would point out that this policy was cancelled by registered letter on the 20th of June, 1925, and no doubt you replaced this insurance at that time in some other Company. We would suggest that you forward notice of your intention to renew to them, as we of course are not in possession of the name of this other Company.\n\nRegretting that we could not carry out your request, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRobert J.

M. McIntyre, of St. Thomas, a copy of which I inclose. You will observe he stated he was forwarding to the Department the policy therein mentioned, and upon receipt of the same official cheque No. 4975 for $100.00 was issued in payment of the premium, which cheque was forwarded to Mr. McIntyre. The policy in question is in the Department, and there is no record of a registered letter of the 21st June, 1925, having been received at the Department cancelling the policy, nor, I may say, was a refund of the unearned premium received. I may state further the Department has been under the impression that the insurance covered by this policy was in force.\n\nIn view of the misunderstanding which has arisen, I shall be glad to receive a copy of the letter of the 20th June which you have mentioned. I shall appreciate also information regarding the unearned premium. Kindly reply without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRobert J.

The Department desires you to carry a further risk of $2,000.00 on the Mount Elgin School buildings. Kindly place the additional insurance and forward the policy to the Department.

Elgin Institute, and the position of this Department was clearly set forth in my letter of the 22nd inst.\n\nThe copy of your registered letter of June 30th, 1923, was never received by this Department. Consequently no notice had been received that insurance was not being carried, otherwise insurance would have been placed with some other Company. This registered letter of yours was incorrectly addressed, as it was sent to \"Mt. Elgin Industrial Farm, Township of Caradoc, County of Middlesex, Ont.\", and this Dept. cannot be held responsible for your mistake.\n\nNot only has the Dept. not had the risk covered, but your Agent has had for three years the premium of $102., paid by this Dept. Your Mr. C. M. McIntyre of St. Thomas, Ont., was paid in March, 1923, by official cheque 4973; the sum of $102., being the amount of the premium on policy 7215. I must ask you to remit to me by return mail the sum of $102., refund of premium paid, and the Dept. will forego asking interest on this sum for the three years.\n\nThe placing of insurance, as all correspondence will show, is done by the Dept. of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, and I would ask you to address all communications to Headquarters. If this practice had been followed I would have known that you did not desire to carry this insurance and could have protected the Department's interest with some other Company. This, however, is a matter of the past, and the Dept. must now look for fire protection from some other Company if you still desire not to carry the risk.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nToronto Casualty Insurance Co.,\nTORONTO, ONT.\nActing Asst.

You demand the return in full of the premium, because we maintain we sent a Registered letter of cancellation. On the other hand, you deny its receipt and this establishes that the policy was in force all the time.\n\nHad a claim occurred you having paid our Agent and never having received the Cancellation would most undoubtedly have claimed under our policy, and we believe we could not have denied liability.\n\nThe money was certainly never received by us, but we fully accept your assurance that you paid it. Hence to make you the return now places the Company in the impossible position of having been insuring the property unknowingly for three years, and then refunding a premium which if it was never received by us.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. C.M. McIntyre of St. Thomas was the Agent of the Company in 1923, and on the 20th March of that year the Department issued official cheque No. 4973 in his favour for $102.00 covering premium on policy No. 7215 in the said Company for a risk for three years on $6,000.00, as above referred to on the Mount Elgin Institute. On the 15th February, 1926, the General Manager of the Company was requested by the Department to send in a renewal receipt for insurance for another three years. He replied, stating that the policy above mentioned had been cancelled for non-payment of premium from date of issue and that therefore the request for renewal could not be considered. The Department, regarding the Company as responsible for its Agent, made request for a refund of the amount paid by official cheque No. 4973, but although several letters have passed between the Department and the Company in the matter refund has not been received.\n\nI may add I shall appreciate the expression of your opinion as to the course of procedure to be observed in this case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D.

McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe: Toronto Casualty F. & M. Ins. Co.\n\nIn furtherance of my letter of the 21st ult., acknowledging your letter of the 20th ult., I have inquired the particulars of this transaction and had the privilege of reviewing the correspondence file of the Company.\n\nI do not think this a proper case for interference by this Department. The one and only question appears to be \"Was the insurance in question validly cancelled pursuant to the statutory conditions, by the registered notice of termination dated June 20th 1923?\" The condition of the policy in force at that date read as follows:\n\n(R.S.C.1914,c.163,S.194)\n\n\"(11) The insurance may be terminated by the company by giving seven days' notice to that effect, and, if on the cash plan, by tendering therewith a rateable proportion of the premium paid, for the unexpired term, calculated from the termination of the notice, and the policy shall cease after such notice, or notice and tender as the case may be, and the expiration of the seven days.\"\n\n\"(15) Any written notice to the assured may be by letter delivered to the assured or by registered letter addressed to him at his last post office address notified to the company, or where no address is notified and the address is not known, addressed to him at the post office of the agency, if any, from which the application was received.\"\nThe written notice intended to be in compliance with the above recited terms of the policy, was addressed to you as follows:- Superintendent General of Indian Affairs for Canada, Mount Elgin Industrial Farm, Township of Caradoc County of Middlesex. This address will appear to be defective in that your address is not at the Mount Elgin Industrial Farm, which circumstance is confirmed by your failure to receive the written notice.\n\nIf a loss had occurred between June 1923 and the expiration of the policy in 1926, you would have thought you were insured and I should think the company would have had considerable difficulty denying the liability. Under these circumstances, if you are prepared to admit that you were in fact insured, you can have no possible claim for the refund of premium. It now seems difficult under the circumstances as I have them before me, for you to urge that the company make a refund on premium because it thought the insurance had terminated. The important question is again \"Was the insurance validly terminated?\"\n\nI should appreciate learning your reaction to my expression of opinion, although in any event I suppose the matter is one for the courts and not for this Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMLF/50H\n\nIndian Affairs.

On the 7th February, 1917, you gave instructions to place an insurance of $12,000.00 on the buildings in order to protect the Indian Funds for the amount contributed by the different Bands. The premium amounting to $60.00 per year has been charged to School Vote but Mr. Perrier thinks this should not be thus charged. As this institution is used for the general education of Indian children, without respect to Bands, I think it would be unfair to now make these Bands who contributed towards the construction pay the premium for insurance on the same instead of charging it to the School Vote.

Jamieson in payment of insurance premium on Mount Elgin School. An Order in Council dated July 5th, 1881, directs that no insurance against fire shall be effected on either movable or immovable property belonging to the Crown.\n\nWill you please advise me if this school is the property of the Crown and if so why the provisions of the above Order in Council were not adhered to. If the school does not belong to the Crown, what is your authority for making the payment?\n\nI would also point out that the document submitted supporting this payment appears to have been written in your office and is not certified, and for those reasons cannot be accepted as a voucher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. Gerthie\nAuditor General.\nMarch 22, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Auditor General has written with reference to the payment of insurance premiums on the Mt. Elmo Indian Residential School. He asks if this institution is in the property of the Crown and if so, why the insurance. Further, he enquires if the school does not belong to the Crown, what is the authority for making payment (I presume he means from Parliamentary Appropriation).\n\nI believe that the protection of the Band's equity in this school should be provided from Band Funds. However, as the Band's equity is now only a small part of the value of the building\u2014say 10 or 15 per cent. of this equity may have disappeared by depreciation, I wish to recommend that the insurance be discontinued.\n\nIn 1896, when the present building was erected, various Indian bands that are served by the Band contributed $19,000 from their funds toward the capital expense. Since that time and including the fiscal year 1930-31, the Department has expended from Parliamentary Appropriation, for minor improvements, a total of approximately $346,300. In 1915, fire destroyed most of the outbuildings, and, assuming the collection of insurance, $7,400 was repaid to the Band Funds, leaving their equity at $11,600. Insurance to the extent of $12,000 has been carried since that time.\n\nThe present policies expire in February and March, 1935. By this time, the Indian bands interested will have enjoyed educational facilities for 39 years, and their share in the building, because of depreciation, will really have disappeared. I restate my recommendation that the insurance be not renewed when it next expires.

Sutherland\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Insurance, Mount Elgin Indian Residential School.\n\nIt has been recently brought to my attention that the Government is carrying $6,000 worth of insurance, per G. A. Jamieson, Stratford, on the above School. I have been informed on several occasions when I raised this question in the Department that the Department of Indian Affairs does not carry insurance on its buildings. It would seem if carrying $6,000 at a cost of $120.00 on a school like Mount Elgin, which is, according to the Government records, valued at $100,000, is poor business. Surely, it should be either adequately insured, or the money which is now being paid in premiums should be used instead for the financing of some part of the School's activities.\n\nIn any event, I thought it might be well to draw your attention to this matter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nK.B.M.T.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 10B)\nOttawa, February 12, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, addressed to Mr. Sutherland of this Department, with reference to insurance carried on the Mt. Elgin Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that insurance to the amount of $12,000 is carried on the buildings, to cover the equity of the various Bands who contributed to the cost of the erection of the building.\n\nIn 1896, when the present building was erected, various Indian Bands that are served by the school contributed $19,000 from their funds towards the capital expense. Since that time, the Department has expended, from Parliamentary Appropriation, for buildings and improvements, a total of approximately $115,000. In 1915, fire destroyed some of the outbuildings, and, pursuant to the collection of insurance, $7,400 was repaid to the Band Funds, leaving their equity at $11,600.\n\nThe present policies expire in February and March, 1936. By this time, the Indian Bands interested will have enjoyed educational facilities for 30 years and their share in the building, because of depreciation, will really have disappeared. The insurance will then be allowed to lapse, as, at that time, the school property will practically belong to the Government.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. A. Jamieson, Esq.,\nInsurance Agent,\nStrathroy, Ontario.\nMay 27th, 1956.\n\nReferring to our conversation over the phone, I beg to give you the following information re insurance on the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School.\n\nIn 1896, when the present building was erected, various Indian Bands that are served by the School contributed \u00a33000.00 from their funds towards the capital expense. Since that time, the Department has expended from Parliamentary appropriation, for building and improvements approximately \u00a3118000.00.\n\nIn 1915, fire destroyed some of the outbuildings and pursuant to the collection of insurance, \u00a37500.00 was repaid to the Band Funds, leaving an equity of only \u00a311000.00.\n\nThe insurance was allowed to lapse because it was considered that after 25 years their equity in the building, because of depreciation, had almost disappeared. The School property practically belongs to the Government and for this reason any insurance carried has been allowed to lapse.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 100)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6208)\n\nFile 468-5, part 10\nCaradoc Agency - Mount Elgin Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts - General Administration - School Establishment, 1945 - 1947.\n\nFile 468-5, part 10A\nCaradoc Agency - Mount Elgin Industrial School - Application Construction Inspector, 1912 - 1915.\n\nFile 468-5, part 10B\nCaradoc Agency - Mount Elgin Industrial School - Insurance, 1896 - 1935.\n\nFile 468-5, part 11\nCaradoc Agency - Mount Elgin Day School - School Establishment - Building maintenance - Supplies - Accounts - General Administration, 1946 - 1947.\n\nFile 468-5, part 12\nCaradoc Agency - Mount Elgin Day School - School Establishment - General Administration - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts, 1946 - 1947.\n\nFile 468-5, part 13\nCaradoc Agency - Mount Elgin Day School - School Establishment - General Administration - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts - Photos - Plans, 1947 - 1948.\n\nFile 468-5, part 14\nCaradoc Agency - Mount Elgin Day School - School Establishment - General Administration - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts - Photo - Plans, 1947 - 1949.\n\nFile 468-5, part 15\nCaradoc Agency - Mount Elgin Day School - General Administration - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts, 1949.\nOttawa, June 22, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nSupt. of Welfare and Training\n\nRe: New four-room Indian Day School,\nCaradoc Agency.\n\nAs instructed, I spent Wednesday and Thursday, June 19 and 20, on the Caradoc reserve in connection with the above. Indian Agent Down and Mr. Charles Ludy, Rodney, Ontario, whom Mr. Armitage chose as foreman for the work, met me in London. We immediately proceeded to the reserve and decided on the position or the new building. It will be built directly in front of the old residential school. It is a splendid site, being high, and we should have no trouble with drainage.\n\nIn conversation with the Indian Agent and Mr. Ludy, who had previously reviewed the plans and specifications, I found that it would be impossible to secure the amount of lumber that we would require. Under these circumstances, we reviewed the plans and specifications again and made certain changes which would permit construction to proceed immediately.\n\nAs a result of this discussion it was decided to make the following changes:\n\n1. General construction - It was decided to use cinder blocks above the concrete foundation.\n\n2. Cinder blocks will be used for interior partitions in the basement.\n\n3. Masonite, 4 ft. high, will be used on the interior sides of the classrooms.\n\n4. The entrance door to the main floor and also the entrance door to the basement will be widened to 6 ft.\n\nWe then proceeded to various places in the immediate vicinity of the reserve, with a view to securing the materials that we needed and to make arrangements for white labour required. This resulted in the following arrangements being fully completed:\n\n1. Graham and Graham, Balmoral Road, London, Ontario, will dig the foundation during the week of July 1. The cost will be $5 per cubic yard and an additional charge of $2.50 an hour for the trucks to cart the excavated earth from the site.\n\n2. Two hundred and forty (240) bbls. of cement were ordered from Mr. Pardy, Moosie Bridges, Ontario. This was the only firm that was in a position to supply the cement within a reasonable time. Mr. Pardy definitely promised that the cement...\nwould be delivered on the site by July 3. Indian Agent Down stated that he had done business with Mr. Fardy previously and found him a very reliable man.\n\n3. The gravel for use in the cement work has been secured from Mr. Mahler, Delaware, Ontario. He will deliver the gravel from the gravel pit to the site or the school at $1.50 a cubic yard. This price includes the cost of the gravel and trucking same a distance of 8 miles. This is the closest gravel pit to the reserve.\n\n4. The cinder blocks were ordered from Elgin Concrete Products (David Winter, President), 324 Talbot Street, St. Thomas, Ontario. Each block is 8 x 8 x 16 and will be delivered for 2s cents each, f.o.b., the site of the school.\n\n5. Fennel Brothers, Newbury, with whom the Department has done business for many years and who are a very reliable firm, will supply most of the lumber that is required. This was also the first in that part of the country that would promise to do so. There may be some of the lumber that even they cannot supply but it will have to be secured wherever available.\n\n6. Indian Agent Down is making arrangements for the cement mixer and a competent man to operate it. The other labour required in this regard will be secured by employing Indians.\n\n7. As suggested by Inspector Arnell, I interviewed Mr. D. D. Crawford, Delaware, with reference to securing carpenters and brick-layers as required. I went to Mr. Brydges but was unable to find Mr. Ed. Bateman as he was not at home. However, I told Mr. Crawford to mention the matter to Mr. Bateman so that he might be able to assist some names if he desired. Mr. Crawford was not aware of any tradesmen of this type who were unemployed at the present time but said he would make enquiries and advise Mr. Down. In the event of Mr. Crawford not being able to suggest any competent workmen, I feel that we will have to leave the matter to the foreman, Charles Ludy and to the Indian Agent.\n\n8. I recommend that Indian Agent Down be authorized to purchase the hardware, nails, etc., when and where available. These items are also in short supply and it will probably be necessary to go to several stores before obtaining the quantity needed.\n\n9. Later on, it will be necessary to have an electrical contractor submit a quotation on wiring the school. Electrical current is available as heavy wires have been connected with the former residential school.\n\n10. At the suggestion of Mr. Ludy, the foreman, it was decided that the services of a surveyor would be needed for an hour or so, to properly lay out the site. Authority was given for employing Mr. John Findlay, St. Thomas, Ontario, to do this work, as St. Thomas is only a few miles from the reserve.\n11. As previously stated, Mr. Charles Ludy was selected as foreman by Mr. Arnell. Mr. Ludy has had considerable experience in the erection of buildings and I think will be a very capable foreman. We have not yet settled with him regarding his salary but I recommend that we offer him ten dollars ($10.00) a day.\n\n12. Indian labour will be used as much as possible. There are one or two efficient Indian carpenters on the reserve and of course they will be employed. As pointed out above, arrangements have also been made for securing any white labour that may be necessary.\n\n13. Before leaving I had another long discussion with both Mr. Ludy and Indian Agent. Both of them are fully aware of all the commitments that were made and I am sure that Mr. Lown will co-operate to the fullest possible extent with Mr. Ludy. As you will note from the above, the basement will be excavated during the week of July 1. The gravel and cement will be on the site by that time and Mr. Ludy will be able to start the actual work immediately. The firm supplying the cinder blocks is manufacturing them in St. Thomas and will supply them as required. Fennel Brothers promised to have the lumber delivered by July 15. Of course, there may be some delay in securing some of the longer pieces required for the roof, but these will not be needed for some time.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, June 24, 1946.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThis will confirm the arrangement made with you by Mr. P.

Down, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBuncy, Ont.\n\nRe: Road from Village to Mount Elgin Residential School, site chosen for new Caradoc School.\n\nWith reference to the construction of the above road I would say that approval has not yet been secured for the expenditure of the funds required to construct this road, but we are asking that an item be placed in the Supplementary Estimates and that until the Supplementary Estimates are passed that we be permitted to use funds from the main estimates in order that this work may be commenced. When the approval is secured I shall get in touch with you further.\n\nIn the meantime, a discussion took place yesterday with officers of the Department of Reconstruction, and we were informed that any project amounting to more than $5,000 had to be first approved by Reconstruction Department if it had not been included in our main estimates. The means of seeking this approval is to file with Reconstruction a form which that department supplies, known as Schedule A, to which must be attached two copies of the plans and specifications of the project. These plans and specifications must be full detailed plans and specifications on which tenders could be called and a contract awarded.\n\nWould it be possible for you to arrange with Mr. Caldwell, the Municipal District Engineer, to prepare these plans and specifications on the basis on which he has submitted his estimate. The concrete culvert which has to be built on the road is part of the project, and is estimated to cost $3,600.00. Could Mr. Caldwell furnish us with a plan of a concrete culvert that could be erected, also a specification. No doubt the Provincial Department of Highways have plans and specifications which would apply both to the road and bridge.\nShould you be unable to secure the plans and specifications from the District Municipal Engineer or other official of the Provincial Government, it will be necessary for the department to have plans and specifications prepared by officers of the Surveys and Engineering Branch. That branch has already a full quota of work to be done, and there will probably be considerable delay in securing the plans from that branch, which will, of necessity, delay the whole project.\n\nI am, as explained to you in the opening paragraph of this letter, writing this letter to you before securing the authority for the expenditure as I am hopeful that the matter will be favourably considered. However, should it have to be delayed until next year the plans and specifications will be required and the schedule will have to be filed with the Department of Reconstruction before any money can be allotted to us for the work. I trust, therefore, that you will be able to forward the plans and specifications at an early date.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, June 14, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Ludy:\n\nWe received your letter of June 1, enclosing bill of material required for the four-room school at the Caradoc Agency.\n\nMr. Arneil, Inspector of Indian Agencies, is obliged to remain in Ottawa, but I intend to visit Western Ontario next week, with a view to having this building started.

JACKSON\nActing Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nJune 15th\nOttawa, July 30, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Down:\n\nI enclose a letter which I have just received which is self-explanatory.\n\nYou may tell the writer that the rate of eighty-six cents an hour for carpenters is the standard rate approved by the Labour Department for the section of the country in which the school is being built.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. G.W. Down,\nIndian Agent,\nMunsey, Ontario.\n\nEnclosure.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nJuly 25, 1946.\n\nMr. G.W. Down,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ontario,\n\nDear Mr. Down,\n\nThere are several matters which I should like to bring to the attention of the Welfare and Training Division, through you, for clarification and approval.\n\nInasmuch as the large building is now vacant, I would request that the telephone be moved over to the old building for the use of the Principal and staff during the coming year. It is my hope that the Department will see fit to provide the telephone for our use, with the understanding that all extra charges for long distance calls be paid for by the individual sender.\n\nThe old building, which now includes the Principal's apartment, his office, three classrooms, four staff rooms and bathroom, as well as the apartment being used by Mr. Bush, an employee of the Department, is supplied with its water from a pump in the main building. It seems reasonable and essential to continue such hydro and water supply as is necessary to operate the old classroom building, and I hope that the authorities will reconsider their purpose to cut off these connections at the end of July. Very little would be needed to make this building electrically independent, the two apartments being on separate meters already. The water supply will need some alteration before the freeze-up.\n\nWith respect to educational facilities for the coming term, I would recommend that classes be not dependent upon the completion of the new school but that they be begun in the classrooms already available here at the time agreed upon for the term's work. I would hope for some direction in the near future as to whether I am to have the privilege and responsibility of securing additional teachers, or whether they will be chosen by the Department upon my recommendation as to our needs.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted by\n\nE.E.M. Joblin,\nDirector of Education.\nOttawa, August 2, 1946.\n\nMr. G.W. Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to the building in which living quarters of the Principal and staff of the new school in your Agency are located, the Department approves the following improvements:\n\n1. You may arrange for the continuation of the Hydro and water supply as is necessary to operate the old classroom building. I understand that the expenditure in this connection will not be heavy, as the two apartments in this building are on separate meters.\n\n2. The heating system in this building should be examined and the necessary repairs made as soon as possible in order to insure that proper heating facilities are available for the coming winter. The expenditure in this regard should be kept as low as possible.\n\n3. Arrangements may be made to move the telephone from the old building to the building used as a residence. It is understood all long distance calls will be paid by the sender.\n\nBernard J. Neary,\nSupt., of Welfare & Training.\nMemorial, Ontario,\nJuly 31, 1946\n\nDear Mr. Phillips,\n\nFollowing your recent visit to the agency, I made contact with Mr. Farnell Ross at Newbury and after much persuasion, I was able to secure a promise of $14,000 cash by Mr. Sheehan to be delivered Wednesday, July 31st. This will give us all the material necessary to commence operations on the basement. But our friend Mr. Steele is now the No. 1 holder.\n\nAfter I left Newbury, I met across country sir an individual who located him and learned definitely his plans. His expenses were trifling until I paid him what he was owing the real estate. I then asked him whether or not he would be able to give us any assistance and eventually draw from him, \"I would prefer you get some person close at hand as I cannot promise to be on the job continuously.\" It was over, and I left him off. He could not take the job. I am now, through the channels suggested by you, endeavouring to locate a man capable of doing the job.\n\nIndian Affairs.

At a meeting held there on August 13, there were present two Provincial School Inspectors. They described a General Motors vehicle which they were buying for use as a small school bus. They described it as a personnel carrier and said it was an army vehicle converted by your firm for civilian use as a light bus. From my army experience I think this is a vehicle known as a Heavy Utility, Personnel.\n\nWe are anxious to secure two of these vehicles providing that we can obtain from you further details as to (a) price and (b) specifications of vehicle.\n\nHoping to hear from you further in this regard, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

The Provincial authorities are also opening a consolidated school in that area. They have been able to obtain ten personnel carriers through the local dealers. These were H.U.P. and were changed for use as school buses.\n\nCan you please tell me if it will be possible for us to put in a bid for two of these H.U.P., now surplus from Army stocks. We would prefer chevrolets.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, August 16, 1946.\n\nMr. George W. Down, Indian Agent,\nMuncey, Ontario.\n\nDifficulties at the Mt.

It is now\nbelieved that these may be on file in the Surveys and Engineering\nBranch of the Department. I expect to write you further about\nthem in the near future.\n\nIn the meantime would you please discuss with the\nReverend Mr. Joblin the possibility of using the dormitory block\nas a school building and temporary classrooms. Mr. Arneil and I\nhave discussed this and feel that it should be much easier to\ncut the heat off the old building rather than the plan we dis-\ncussed during our recent visit. It would be necessary to have\nMr. Joblin move from the old building to the new one and also to\nhave the desks moved across, but this should be relatively easy\nto do.\n\nIf it were felt that the heating of this entire\nresidential block would be too great a burden, then possibly the two\nwings could be shut off entirely and the doors sealed with Ten\nTest or similar insulating material.\n\nI would appreciate your comments on these\nsuggestions.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, August 16, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Young:\n\nImmediately upon my return to Ottawa I contacted the General Motors representative here. I described to him the school buses which you discussed with me at Caradoc.\n\nHe has phoned me and says that apparently these vehicles are not being handled by General Motors Company but it is believed they are being sold through the body builders who have modified them. He thought that this would be done by either the Wilson Body Company at Long Branch, Ontario, or the Brantford Body Company at Brantford, Ontario.\n\nIt is quite likely that these vehicles are being sold through General Motors dealers in your area. However, I would appreciate your informing me as soon as possible as to the company which is actually modifying and selling these vehicles, so that I can arrange to purchase two of them for the Caradoc Agency.\n\nI will be writing to you further as to our progress in overcoming the various difficulties which seem to stand in the way of our consolidation plans. I hope to have the pleasure of meeting you again in the near future.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

I therefore feel that a short report is in order.\n\nTo get things running smoothly on any building project it involves unforeseen and sometimes annoying difficulties, and this particular undertaking is no exception. In digging the footing foundations they encountered about 3 feet of water on a blue clay bottom. I was immediately consulted and from now on it would appear that I am Indian Agent, Building Consultant, Farm Instructor and General Fixer. Quite a series of titles but what's in a name? The work interests me; everything around me is its either has to go or bog down; and the only bogging down that I will permit in this particular school building is a material short supply. To take care of the water problem I was able to obtain sufficient field tile, and had the Indian labourers dig a deep trench leading to the river bank where we took our first footing. But, to change to say, our next problem was water; but water we wanted, not water we wanted to dispose of. It was necessary in mixing cement for the footings. Several unsuccessful attempts were tried, and eventually I secured a small gasoline engine with rotary pump attached, and then began to dig out the main water line from the spring. This is located, and had a plumber tap into it and install the pumping unit on the ground surface. Presto! All the water we need to complete the building operations, and perhaps supply the school with a close at hand efficient water system. After this foundation work were ready to pour cement footings but, alas! a large-size cement mixer was out at another job and was not available but,\u2014the show must go on. I immediately had the Agency small mixer taken to the site and presto! once again, we were operating.\n\nI have just left the site and am able to report everything running like a clock and, without further mishap, the entire footing foundation, 250', will be poured by Thursday noon. We will then be ready to commence building and placing the cribbing for the basement walls.\nFor this we have everything on hand with the exception of a few pieces of 2x4 lumber, and nails. For these two items I am now securing the country.\n\nI have accepted my new job of Building Consultant philosophically, and will tender my account at a later date! In the meantime am taking a few days vacation but will be back on the job by the 16th of September when I hope to see the cribbing built and ready for pouring the walls. I shall then start my rounds again for the necessary materials, and bricklayers.\n\nIn conclusion, I am very pleased with the progress to date and can assure you that everything is being done, and will be done, to keep things moving.\n\nGeo.

Elgin Indian Day School\n\nFurther to building progress at the New School, I have to advise that the complete cement basement wall is poured and the men are taking down the forms. This leaves us ready for two or three jobs and we are proceeding accordingly to supply of material.\n\nIn this connection, I made personal contact with Fennell & Sons of Newbury, and they advise that they will be able to supply the entire order of lumber as the building progresses with the exception of the joists. They advise that such lumber is available in quantity and that it should not be difficult to secure a priority certificate. For purpose of application, I had them list the required pieces and the list is attached hereto. The most likely place to secure this type of lumber is through the head Office for Ontario of the Beaver Lumber Company at St. Catherines, Ontario. I think an effort should be made to secure the material as it means holding up of the upper structural work. In the meantime, we are preparing to build the partition walls in the basement. Under the difficult circumstances, I am able to report satisfactory progress, and if you can secure a priority for delivery of the material mentioned, I do not anticipate any major holdup.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nGeo.

Elgin Day School:\n\nReference is made to the last paragraph of your letter of September 10. In this connection I have contacted Mr. Earl Burch.\n\nMr. Burch is an Indian and a member of the Chippewa of the Thames Band. He is a veteran with overseas service in War 2, with transportation experience. I know Earl for a steady conscientious worker and I do not know of any man on the Reserve more suitable for the job. I would strongly recommend his appointment. However, he is not interested in part time work but he is interested in the job of driving the bus and will hire as a utility man on a yearly basis of $1200.00. In other words, when he is not driving the bus he will be available for any minor repairs on government vehicles. He is available at once and it would appear that his request for all time employment is reasonable.\n\nI await your comments.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGWD/JA\nOttawa, 3 October, 1946.\n\nMr. C.W. Down, Indian Agent,\nMUNCEY, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to official letter of August 29th you should have the classroom accommodation in the old residential school thoroughly cleaned.\n\nI presume that you have already carried out instructions contained in official letter of September 9th. The plumber told Mr. Doucet that he would be willing to do the work about the middle of September. The radiators required in Mr. Joblin's apartment should be installed as soon as possible.\n\nTransportation\n\nThis problem has now been practically solved by the purchase of an Army ambulance. You should take the necessary steps to have this modified for use as a school bus. You are authorized to purchase a license for this vehicle. We will write you later this week regarding the employment of Mr. Burch. We are attempting to locate a smaller vehicle for an extra bus but it may not be possible to obtain this in the immediate future.\n\nTeachers\n\nThe Department approves the appointment of Mr. W.C. Johnston as teacher at this school. In view of your remarks in your letter of September 25th that this teacher will be required to do both academic and manual training teaching, it has been decided to pay him at the rate of $137.00 a teaching month effective from the date on which the school opens.\nThe lorry which has been purchased is for use on Agency Reserves in Southern Ontario. You will receive further instructions regarding it from Inspector Arnell. The cost of this vehicle was not paid from the appropriation for Indian Education.\n\nConclusions\n\nYou are to make every effort to have this school opened as soon as possible using the one bus for transportation.\n\nCol. Neary will visit your Agency on October 11th to attend the Teachers' Convention and will be able to discuss this matter further with you. We will write to you separately regarding the Convention.\n\nDirector.\n7-9-5 (T.T. 1)\n\nOttawa, 3 October 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nThe attached account for $1060.59 covers the cost of lumber purchased for the new Indian School in the Caradoc Agency.

However, the plumber has dismantled the tank in the old laundry and has it ready for installment in the basement of the old school, but I am not going to guarantee Mr. Doucet's figure of $150.00, neither will the plumber; and the piping in the old building will have to be dismantled, which takes time and costs money.\n\nIt is quite apparent that this job must be done.

THOMAS, Ontario.\nGOVERNMENT MOTOR VEHICLE COMMITTEE\n\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, October 1st, 1946.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nYour application for the purchase of a used 1940 Ford 1\u00bd-ton Ambulance for use as a bus by children attending an Indian Day School was before the Committee at today's meeting but was held for further information.\n\nIt is not clear where this vehicle is to be used as it is said to be for use under the direction of R.A.Hoey, Director, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa. Will you please give more specific information in this connection.\n\nThe Committee noted that the vehicle recommended for purchase is a used one and according to information received from your department by the Committee's Secretary, it is being purchased from a dealer. The Government has never made a practice of buying used cars from dealers for the reason that there is no way of determining the proper value of such vehicles. The vehicle here referred to was presumably sold to the dealer by War Assets Corporation. If the purchase of a vehicle for the purposes above referred to is approved by the Board, would it not be cheaper to purchase direct from War Assets Corporation rather than from a dealer.\n\nWill you please inform the Committee if the matter of providing transportation for children attending Indian Day Schools is a new policy of your Department. If it is not a new policy, please advise at what other schools such services are provided.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) W.C.Ronson,\nChairman.\nMemorandum: Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter from the Chairman of the Government Motor Vehicle Committee, requesting further information in connection with the purchase of a Ford Ambulance for use as a bus in transportation of Indian children to and from school.\n\nYou might furnish me with the information requested, in order that I may prepare a suitable reply.\n\nThe same information will, no doubt, be necessary in connection with the Lorry which is also being purchased from Middlesex Motors.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nOttawa, October 10, 1946.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nSchool bus for Caradoc Indian Agency\n\nUse of Vehicle\n\nThis vehicle, a Ford 1\u00bd ton ambulance, is intended for use as a school bus at the Mount Elgin Indian Day School, near Muncey, Ontario. The branch has closed down the residential school at this place and is now building a four-room consolidated school for junior and senior high grades and for auxiliary training classes. This consolidation will involve the bringing of the children for distances up to 6 miles. This will not only relieve the load on the badly overcrowded elementary schools but will also eliminate the payment of tuition grants now being paid to have these children attend provincial schools. We are going to use the old buildings of the residential school while awaiting the completion of the new school. We are now all ready to begin classes but lack a bus.\n\nOn August 18 a letter was sent to our Assets Corporation Head Office in Montreal, requesting information regarding the availability of two personnel carriers. The use of these vehicles was recommended by the Provincial Inspectors of Schools in the Strathroy area, whose school records were purchasing ten of them from General Motors dealers. On August 27 we again wrote our Assets Corporation in Toronto as our original letter had been referred there. On September 7 an answer was received, which read:\n\n\"At the present time we have no available surplus from which your requirements can be met. However, if such type of...\"\nvehicle should become available shortly in which case they will be offered to you\".\n\nOne of the branch officials visited the Cariboo Agency and learned through the Provincial School Inspector that Middlesex Motors were expecting vehicles in which would be suitable for school bus purposes. Actually this ambulance which is now available is a much better type of vehicle for a school bus than a personnel carrier for the following reasons:\n\n(1) It has a much larger carrying capacity (replaces two personnel carriers required).\n\n(2) It is a safer vehicle due to its all steel body.\n\n(3) It is a warmer vehicle (the personnel carrier's windows are only made of transparent plastic).\n\nSince the request to purchase this ambulance was forwarded, our Assets Corporation have informed us that a used personnel carrier was available. However, this was only one vehicle of the two required and could have only provided transportation for some ten children. Due to time lapse, this vehicle can not now be purchased as our Assets have to be advised of acceptance within 10 days.\n\nNow a month and a half of the school term has passed and these children still have no adequate transportation.\n\nTransportation Policy\n\nThe trend in modern education is towards consolidated schools and away from the one-room school. In line with this provision of a broader and more adequate education the Branch has begun a series of school consolidations. Elsewhere, such as at St. Catherine's Indian Day School at Duncan, B.C.; Fisher River Day Schools, Manitoba; Saguenay, Que., and some dozen other places, it has been possible to provide transportation by contract with local bus operators. However, this has not been possible at Cariboo due to the fact that there is a large consolidation being carried out by local provincial school...\nauthorities. The Superintendent of Welfare and Training, the Inspector of Indian Agencies for Ontario, the Indian Agent and the Supervising Principal of the Caradoc Indian Schools met with Provincial Inspectors of Schools Gordon Young and H. Smith to discuss this situation. As previously pointed out, the local School Boards are purchasing used army personnel carriers, ambulances, etc., from local dealers as they have been unable to get local bus operators to contract for school transportation. They assured us there was no hope of getting such a contract for our school.\n\nAnother deciding factor was the poor roads in the Agency. During the winter there will be a dearth of snow clearing equipment, we have not been able to purchase the snow plow required. Therefore the Army Type 4 wheel drive vehicle will be able to provide transportation where a normal 2 wheel drive vehicle would fail.\n\nThere is then an urgent necessity for this vehicle. The purchase from a local dealer was requested only after car assets possibilities had been examined thoroughly. The school is ready; the pupils are ready; the teachers are ready\u2014all that is lacking is transportation for those living over 3 miles from the school.\n\nDictated by Col.

We have written to her, describing the work at your school and are now awaiting a reply from her. She has had some experience in the Anglican Residential School at Moose Factory and a change in plans has again made her available for Indian work. I expect to write you further in this regard.

(RG 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 11)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMuncey, Ontario,\nNov. 6, 1948.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of November last with regard to the Normal Training Building at the former Mt. Elgin Residential School, which I find difficult to understand. Mr. Joblin did not relinquish control of anything and at all times he had full control of all buildings. I have never had charge and therefore have nothing to hand over and since Mr. Joblin advised me that the machinery did not belong to the Department of Indian Affairs, but to the United Church of Canada, and that he has been advised accordingly, I therefore took it as a polite request to leave things alone.\n\nThere is such a thing as being loyal to one's employer, but I do not wish to enter into any acrimonious discussion or correspondence with officials of the United Church. In any case, Mr. Joblin will be advised of the contents of your letter without delay and any machinery or a motor, which was suggested missing during your visit and is being used by Mr. Joblin in connection with the building of the new school, will be returned immediately.\n\nWith regard to the old school laundry, I do not know who made the suggestion, but I am definitely not interested in any workshop that is not under our personal supervision and control and I certainly will not be told that the machinery therein does not belong to us. After recent events I am more than ever convinced that I want no part in establishing such a workshop in the buildings of the old Mt. Elgin School.\n\nIf you wish to establish a suitable shop for repairing farm machinery, I have a building in the setup of Agency buildings and I'll need whatever pieces of machinery and if you are prepared to finance the proposition, I will submit a list of what is necessary. If not, I must carry on in the old inefficient way, but there is one thing I must point out. I cannot longer undertake to repair this old farm machinery that is returning under our fast depleting Welfare revolving account. While\nI am on this question I must point out that before the Spring of 1947, and well in advance of seeding, the entire question of individual Indian farming under a Farm Instructor and the farming of the old Mt. Elgin lands must be discussed and practical working arrangements made.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nGeo. W.

Mr. Mahler and I were very much concerned and did not know where to attach the blame. I therefore had a check of materials made, also a general perusal of the blue prints and it was not until a check was made with Fennell and Son, the firm supplying the manufactured merchandise, that I discovered the mistake and that the Surveys and Engineering Branch of the Department of Mines & Resources is directly responsible.\n\nIt was revealed that two separate plans had been submitted. Plan No. 1 under date of April, 1943, and Plan No. 2 under date of February, 1945. Compare these plans and you will discover that there are many differences such as windows, elevations, joist material etc. The bill of material was ordered under Plan No. 1 and the building was proceeding under plan No. 2. Under the circumstances I had to discard one plan, and owing to the fact that the building was proceeding under No. 2, No. 1 was discarded. I also ordered Mr. Fennell to discontinue manufacture of material.\naccordingly. We are now off on the right foot but I think the matter of a building is important enough to register a complaint of carelessness against officials of the Surveys and Engineering Branch. I am extremely busy and have had to give a great deal of my time in straightening the matter out.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that the basement is complete with window sashes placed and we are taking advantage of the mild weather in laying the cement blocks dividing the various basement rooms, which when finished, leaves everything in readiness for the upper structure.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo.

This bus, you will recall, is of the army ambulance type and the driver reports that the woodwork and top of the ambulance proper is falling to pieces and is unsafe for the carrying of children. He has tried to keep it in repair with nails and screws but the woodwork, such as posts and ceiling cross bars, is rotted. In other words the entire body must be rebuilt.\n\nThe men report that they can do the work themselves if the right type of material can be obtained. I am therefore suggesting that the repair of this vehicle is necessary, and recommend that the job be done before an accident happens. A rough estimate of the cost for material and labour would be around $100.00 to $150.00.\n\nPlease advise.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. W.

Since then I have maintained a regular contact with various lumber merchants in the hope of securing the necessary material. The situation is still difficult and likely to remain so. However, I have been promised favorable consideration in shipments which might arrive in the near future. Quite recently I learned of some second hand steel beams salvaged from a bridge in the city of London which the contractor promised me first consideration. We could use some of this material to advantage and I am wondering what your reaction to purchasing our requirements would be. It can be purchased for approximately four and one half or five cents a pound, F.O.B. Muncey, which is considerably below cost to say nothing of the F.O.B. point.\n\nI spoke to Mr. Arneil about it and asked him to mention it to you. Personally, I think it is a good buy and might be the means of getting building operations started again. What do you suggest? My other thought is that I am to proceed with arrangements as made in the fiscal year of 1946, namely, to go ahead with the purchase of necessary material, also hire and pay men on an hourly\nbasis with the foreman based at $10.00 a day. In other words material cost and labour basis. If so please forward an accountable advance sufficient to pay labour as we progress.\n\nLast year, $4,000.00 was provided but an unexpended balance of $1,409.93 was returned to the Receiver General at the end of the 1946-47 fiscal year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo.

I have, however, shared with him at all times our short supplies with other schools and promised a share as additional supplies are secured.\n\nWith regard to the fountains I regret to advise that they are not available and, since Mr. Joblin recommended them, I asked him if he could direct me to a source of supply. I also suggested other types of equipment such as filterers or a tap turned upside down which might be used temporarily until other types are available, but he apparently wants the fountain type.

We hope you'll like it.\n\nNow that we've brought the child into being, however, the job of supporting it is yours as well as our own. That responsibility we cheerfully pass on to you.\n\nBut, seriously, the Reo Safety School Bus News is your publication. Please consider it as such and use it as such. We need your wholehearted support in making a GO of this publication. Send photos, suggestions, ideas\u2014material right off the firing line. Let's pool our knowledge and experience and put this over with a bang.\n\nWe hope you will enjoy this first issue of the Reo Safety School Bus News, which we plan to make more interesting, informative and colorful with each succeeding issue.\n\nMeantime, don't forget, send your comments and suggestions to Reo Motors, Inc., School Bus Division, Lansing 20, Mich.\n\nFull Steam Ahead!\n\nA year after War's end finds schools throughout the country in almost desperate need of new and safe transportation equipment.\n\nA year after War's end finds widespread public understanding of \"Safety\" and a willingness to finance \"Safe\" School Transportation. Money is available. States have accumulated an estimated $1 billion dollars, which is now reflected in State aid to schools.\n\nNow, beginning in 1947, Reo can, and will, produce complete Safety School Buses in volume to meet the rapidly growing and definitely urgent need for real modern, safe school transportation equipment.\n\nThe problem of building and equipping a plant in 1946 was a big one. We did it however\u2014and are now ready to proceed full steam ahead.\nHome of Reo Safety School Bus Bodies is situated in the center of New York State, midway between Syracuse and Utica, New York on the main line of the New York Central railroad. The plant has over 250,000 square feet of floor space under cover and is equipped with the latest modern machinery to produce all-steel Reo Safety School bus bodies. The new final assembly building 450 feet long and 120 feet wide, does not have a post in the building and has the very latest in modern equipment for the assembly of bodies, including four moving assembly lines and infra red light paint drying ovens. Capable executive personnel, plus a force of specially trained workers, provides that great wealth of experience and ability which has, and will continue to contribute so much to the history of advanced body design in the field of school bus transportation.\nThe National School Administering Convention will be held in Atlantic City, New Jersey, from March 4 through March 6, 1947. School administrators are invited to attend. The keynote will be delivered by Dr. J. W. Reo. This will be an unusual opportunity for educators to meet and discuss current educational issues.\n\nJ-7\u2014in Convention Hall for more information.\n\nRemember the date\u2014March 4th.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This provided ideal quarters with every facility for the roadeo officials to conduct their varied activities.\n\nIncidentally, the event was a big Reo triumph, with Charles Zimmerman, of Cushman Motor Delivery Company, Chicago, turning in a stellar performance with a Reo tractor to win the title of World Champion Truck Driver in the tractor-trailer contest.\n\nAlthough having no part in the roadeo, of course, the Reo Safety School Bus attracted a great deal of attention and favorable comment.\n\nAbove\u2014school principals of Cortlandt County, New York State, take over one of the 53 passenger Reo Safety School Buses delivered to Olean Central School, Olean, New York by Slawson & Sons, Reo Dealer.\n\nIndian Affairs.

These two schools are:\n\n1. Kekaskomi Day School\n2. Mount Elgin Day School.\n\n1. Kekaskomi Day School\n\nThis is a four-room school now being completed on the Kekaskomi Reserve, Cape Breton, N.S. The Indians from the scattered reserves throughout this province are being concentrated on this big reservation where adequate medical care, educational facilities and other social services can be made available.\n\nIn line with consolidated school policies of provincial departments of education, a four-room school was erected rather than having four small one-room school houses scattered over the reserve. In this way we will also be able to offer vocational training for both boys and girls\u2014a thing that is impossible in a one-room school.\n\nA 30 passenger bus will be required to transport those children living at a distance greater than 5 miles from the\nschool. It is estimated there will be some forty odd children so located and that two trips will be necessary.\n\n2. Mt. Elgin Day School\n\nHere we converted an old residential school into a day school. Actually this is a high school, drawing the older pupils from the smaller schools on the reserve. In November, 1946, a Ford 1\u00bd ton ex-army ambulance was purchased as a school bus. This bus has been over-crowded all winter and we have been highly gratified at the pupils' response to the higher education that we are offering.\n\nActually it has proven very much cheaper to run this as a day school rather than a residential school. However, there will be some 65 pupils in attendance at this school in September and further transportation will have to be provided. At the present time the former ambulance is making 2 trips each morning and each afternoon. The school is being conducted from 8:30 until 5:00 in order to accommodate those children who arrive early and those who arrive later.\n\nThis reserve is a very large one and the school is in the centre. With the larger number of students who will pass their entrance in June it will be absolutely essential to provide another bus for them. The former ambulance can then do the loop to the east of the school and the new bus can do the loop to the west of the school.\n\nIn both instances, Car Assets Corporation have been written concerning the provision of these busses and they have reported no results in their endeavours to locate suitable vehicles. These letters are attached.\n\n[Signature]\n\nEncl.\n\nLkK/1\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJune 4th, 1947.\n\nGeo W. Down, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nReference the adding machine and typewriter desk which were taken over from the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada from their previous location in the Elgin Residential School. I would request that complete information be supplied as to the make and serial number of the adding machine and that this information be forwarded to the Branch together with a statement showing the present condition of this machine.

(RG 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 12)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMuncey, Ontario,\nJuly 17, 1947.\n\nRe: Your File 7-9-5 (WT 1)\n\nFollowing receipt of your letter of July 10th I made arrangements to visit the garage of the London Bus Company and inspect vehicles they offer for sale.\n\nFirst, let me explain that these buses have been in service on the streets of London since the old \"trolley car\" system was discontinued. There are two 23 passenger capacity types and one 32. The 32 is decidedly not suitable for school bus transportation; therefore I think I may dispense with any report on it. The smaller type could perhaps be used satisfactorily, but I am unimpressed with the initial cost of second-hand vehicles with engine trouble to their credit of one third of a million miles - I hesitate. However, since I was asked to examine the buses my report is as follows:\n\nThe first point that struck me was the over-all size, in other words too much bus and not enough seating accommodation for school bus service. This, however, is not a major handicap as changes could be made. I was then particularly interested in road clearance which causes problems on most Indian Reservations. We must keep in mind the mud in the late Fall and early Spring and the snow during the Winter, also the fact that we have absolutely no snow removal equipment. This is indeed a problem.\n\nRoad clearance is approximately 16 inches which is not bad and, with its weight, would perhaps handle itself. I then suggested that they start the motor and go for a drive. \"Sure, why not.\" On the road the engine seemed to be running smoothly but in high gear I noticed a decided shudder in the rear end. After driving around the town there was some difference of opinion among the bus officials as to whether or not it is characteristic of the gears and whether replacing them would stop it. Apart from this it appeared to be running smoothly, particularly good for entering the easy manoeuvrability of the buses. The interior is in fair condition and the tires are all re-caps. If purchase is made they promise to equip both buses with the best re-caps they have in stock.\nI was not too hasty and gave myself ample time to look the job over thoroughly. My final conclusion is that they are rather cumbersome for school bus service but will do the job and perhaps satisfactorily. I must keep in mind, however, their age and the miles travelled. If this were a personal transaction between the Bus Company and myself I would not care to commit myself to $3,550.00 and certainly I would not pay this amount for any second-hand motor vehicle with an engine mileage of 340,000 and 323,000 miles. I feel, if we are going to spend $3,550.00 on a school bus, that we should be looking for a type with less body space, a little more clearance and more seating accommodation. There are many types of small buses that one sees on the road which I am sure, purchased new, would not cost a great deal more, if any, than $3,550.00.\n\nAs far as we at the Caradoc Agency are concerned it is not a matter of urgency. We are getting along without major difficulties. I would therefore suggest that we do not commit ourselves too hastily and when we purchase let us decide on something that is standard and serviceable and will give good service for years without major repairs. It is difficult for me to say everything I would like by correspondence. Perhaps in the near future we may get together on this school transportation question. In the meantime if, after reading this report, you feel that there is an immediate use for these buses then either one, or the two, will likely do the jobs you have in mind and perhaps give good service; but you must be prepared, as with any vehicle with the recorded mileages, for major breaks and repairs.\n\nIn conclusion say I say that it must go in the records that the need at the Caradoc Agency is not sufficiently pressing to justify my recommending the purchase of either of these buses at the prices quoted.\n\nI have attached, hereto, pictures of the types offered for sale.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo.

Noary,\nSupt., Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Noary,\n\nIn view of your cooperation in the matter of securing teachers and accommodation for them, I am sorry that I find it necessary to write such a lot of complaint as this must be. You have provided us with a splendid group of teachers, and we were able to open all the new schools on schedule. But we have no transportation, without which the rest is likely to be wasted.\n\nThe one bus, which should not carry more than twenty, has been away for repairs for these two weeks. I learned today that we need not look for the parts even before two more weeks. Mr. Burch has been driving the old school truck. I wish you could see it now. It is neither safe nor at all suitable, but what could we do? Had the long-promised second bus been here, it could have carried on nicely.\n\nThere will be forty pupils from the Oneida side this year, that is to happen when they start. We need that 60-passenger bus now, next Monday. It will be hard indeed to convince you that there are none available, when they have been advertised in our Sunday paper for the past month, even up to yesterday's paper clipped enclosed, one of which I sent earlier. I find it difficult to believe that anyone has even made an attempt to secure such a bus for us. There should be from 60 to 65 pupils this year. The need of a 40-passenger bus has been admitted repeatedly; there has been a fairly wide choice of vehicles available, yet a year has gone by, we begin the third week of school, and there is still no indication of our having such a bus.\n\nI hope there will be an early reply to this letter -- in the form of an advance on service for my trouble.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He stated that he had an interview with Mr. Vincent and advised Mr. Vincent the Ford Motor Company was prepared to supply a bus with a capacity of 29, at a cost of $6,153.

Hamilton because the body installation will be done by the Van Wilson Equipment Company at that point.\n\nWe trust that this quotation will be of interest to you. The dealer has agreed to hold the bus chassis available for one week and for this reason as we explained to you this morning we would greatly appreciate a reply as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFORD MOTOR COMPANY OF CANADA, Limited\n\nL.R.

(your memorandum 73169-15-11 of September 9 refers). It is felt that a Reo school bus of this model would be just as satisfactory as the Ford and at a saving of some $300.00.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Kaiser in Sydney informed me that the 31 passenger model bus could be delivered within a month from the factory. It is also thought that for delivery in Ontario the Reo would cost less than the $5,865. above mentioned.\n\nBernard J.

In this connection I am at the point in construction where electrical roughing in work should be commenced. I am also ready for the heating unit. If you will consult the blue print you will note that the heating is hot air. It therefore means that all shafts leading to the various classrooms must be installed before the partitions are built.\n\nI think I mentioned in my letter the difficulty in securing firms, situated as we are, interested in a job at Muncey. If a decision of some kind is not soon reached as to how I am to proceed with this work I shall have to call a halt in building operations. I think you will agree and understand my position and realize that there is no point in building only to tear down again. It would therefore be greatly appreciated if you would please endeavour to expedite a decision.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGWD/JA\n\nIndian Affairs.

How many buses does the Department expect to purchase for the purpose of transporting Indian children to and from school?\n\nA. This will depend upon the recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee into the Indian Act. At the present time indications are that they will favour the operation of day schools over residential schools. If this is the case then it will become the gradual policy of the Department to reduce the number of residential schools and to operate day schools in their places. These consolidated day schools will require buses to carry the children daily to school.\n\n(2) Q. Where will they be located?\n\nA. At the present time there are only four centres at which we feel these will be required. These are, Caradoc, Ontario, Eskasoni, Nova Scotia, Wikwemikong, Ontario and Six Nations, Ontario. At the first two places buses are definitely required at the present time. It is not anticipated that our building plans will have proceeded\nfar enough at the other two reserves to necessitate the purchase of buses until next year.\n\n(3) C. Approximately how many children will be carried at each centre?\n\nA. At Caradoc there are fifty children and at Eskasoni there are seventy children. At Six Nations and at Wikwemikong, the progress made in our building plans will decide the number who will have to be transported.\n\n(4) C. How many round trips per day per vehicle?\n\nA. At Caradoc there will be two round trips per day as long as the old bus continues to function. In bad weather when we are unable to use the old bus, the new bus will have to do four round trips per day (See attached map).\n\nAt Eskasoni there will be two round trips per day.\n\n(5) C. What is the minimum and maximum distances from homes to schools at each centre?\n\nA. Our policy in this regard is to follow the regulations usually followed by Provincial Departments of Education. This is to the effect that children under ten years of age can be expected to walk up to two miles to school and that children over ten years of age can be expected to walk up to three miles.\n\nThe maps attached hereto will show clearly the long distances involved in these two places.\n\n(6) C. How do the children get to school presently at each centre?\n\nA. At Caradoc the residential school was closed on the understanding that a day school would be opened and that transportation for these children would be provided as prescribed in the Indian Act. We are unable to get tenders for the provision of a new bus; therefore, we obtained a former army ambulance. We are using this to do one circuit on the Caradoc Reserve and are using an open farm truck on the smaller circuit.\nIt is our intention to use the new bus on the larger circuit and to use the ambulance bus on the smaller circuit. At the present time we are running grave risks and are endangering the health and safety of these children by transporting them in an open farm truck.\n\nThe school block at the former residential school is one hundred years old and has been condemned but we have a new four room school now being rushed to completion. The school population on this Reserve has grown to such an extent that at the present time we are conducting classes in a church basement and in an agricultural hall as well as in the other school buildings previously provided. We can, undoubtedly, fill this new bus to capacity and within a short time have many standees. This new school will also operate as a consolidated high school.\n\nAt Eskasoni, the Indian Affairs Branch has been carrying out a large consolidation scheme by moving Indians from isolated reserves of Nova Scotia to a centralized Reserve ideally located at Eskasoni. We have just completed a four room day school and have hired a staff of fully qualified teachers. The enrolment at this school is, at the present time one hundred and twenty and of these some sixty require transportation, (See attached map). We are using our farm truck to transport daily these sixty children back and forth to the school. This truck is an open panel model and we have stationed our Indian policemen on it daily to protect those carried. Here again, we are seriously endangering the health and safety of these children, until we provide them with a closed in vehicle as required by the school laws of every one of the nine provinces.\n\n(7) Q. Under what authority is transportation by Government vehicles provided?\n\nA. Section 9 (3) of the Indian Act reads as follows:\n\"The Superintendent General (Minister) may provide for the transporting of Indian children to and from a boarding or industrial school to which they are assigned...\"\n\nCould we please have returned the Caradoc map attached hereto, as this is an official document required by the Indian Agent concerned.\n\nDirector\n\nEnclosure\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 12)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMuncey, Ontario,\nNov. 7, 1947.\n\nRe: Your File 7-9-5 (WT)\n\nI have received your letter of November 4th, re electrical and heating contracts at the New School, and although I knew the firm mentioned could not undertake this work the emergency of the matter necessitated immediate contact.\n\nThe firm you have chosen is not a contracting one in any sense of the word. It is merely two young men, recently located in the village of Delaware, whose work consists mostly of repairing wells and not too intricate plumbing and electrical repairs. In this connection I have given these two boys all the repair work I possibly could. However I discussed the matter of contracts with them and, without hesitation, they advised that they are definitely not hot air heating mechanics and would not, under any circumstance, accept the job. As far as the electrical work is concerned they would only accept it on a cost plus basis, and would likely have to be paid for their work as the job progressed. This would complicate matters and it is doubtful if they would be able to secure a quota of material to carry on the job without delays. They are not equipped; they are not contractors, not fully qualified and I can only conclude that the person submitting the recommendation has insufficiently estimated the job we have on hand and insufficiently estimated the qualifications of these two young men representing the Delaware Plumbing and Electric Company.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6208, file 468-5, part 12)\nIt is regretted that we must have these delays, especially in a case where we are working against time. However, I have followed your instructions, and I regret that I must return the matter to you for further consideration. Personally, I am not concerned with who does the job. I am interested only in getting the job done at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGWD/JA\nI have received your letter of November 16th with regard to the installing of a furnace at the New School. In this connection Mr. Phil Phelan recently visited the Agency and I discussed with him the possibility of an oil furnace which would be a much more satisfactory unit for this building, and he intimated that he would take the matter up with the Engineering and Surveys Branch on his arrival back in Ottawa; therefore before contacting Mr. Dodds, of Glencoe, Ontario, I would like your views on the matter. It will then enable me to putline to Mr. Dodds the type of furnace required, either coal or oil. If a coal furnace must be installed it will have to be equipped complete with stoker and blower unit and thermostatically controlled. Oil is easier, more economical, and would not require a certified person which I believe, under Provincial law, is necessary in public and school buildings.\n\nHowever, the suggestion emanated from a discussion between Mr. Phelan and myself. Your decision in the matter will be followed as soon as your wishes are received.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, November 21, 1947.\n\nMr. Geo. W. Down, Indian Agent,\nMuncie, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, the Surveys and Engineering Branch have no objection to the installation of oil heating provided the cost is approximately the same as the furnace they recommend.\n\nHowever, they point out that owing to conditions at the present time it is extremely difficult to be assured of a supply of oil.\n\nPlease interview Mr. Dodds to obtain prices on both installations. You should also let us know if you are definitely assured of a supply of oil in the event that we decide to accept the oil heating installation.\n\nBernard F.

This bus is available for immediate delivery and I understand that the firm was circularized to submit cost estimates.\n\nMr. Mahler has approached me in this matter because such types of vehicles are in demand and they cannot hold it for delivery at our convenience. In other words if we cannot secure authorization to purchase they will, because of the money they have tied up in it, be forced to sell elsewhere.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGWD/JA\nI find it necessary to draw attention to repairs needed for the set 1 bus, Departmental Vehicle No. 1168, and to register protest against the system outlined in paragraph 12, page 6, of the Indian Agent's References and Regulations wherein it advised that tires must not be purchased until Ottawa approval has been obtained. I know, of course, that the ruling is not your making but it does seem strange that such a vital necessity to the running of any vehicle must be held up in such a manner. Please be advised that, owing to a blow out, a complete check was made of all tires, six in number, and they are all in a condition dangerous to safe driving particularly the transportation of school children. The set is the original which came with the truck over a year ago and, as the complete unit is a discarded military ambulance, they have already given very little service. Second hand equipment of any type is more or less trouble equipment and evidently this vehicle is no exception. I can only suggest that if the bus is to remain in service that it be equipped with new tires all around as soon as possible, six in all, complete with tubes. The approximate cost for each tire is $45.40 less 10 per cent less 10 per cent tax = $39.95 for each tire. The approximate total cost is $239.70.\n\nIn addition Mr. Earl Burch, the driver, advises that there must be some system of heating the vehicle both in\nthe driving cab and the bus proper. When this vehicle was received it was stripped of everything apart from necessary running equipment. I would therefore suggest that a universal type of heater be authorized for the driver's cab, also a small motor which, I understand, may be attached to the heating system and drives a fan circulating the heat into the bus proper. I do not know the approximate cost of these units but I would say $100.00 should cover the heating suggestion.\n\nThe matter of tires is urgent. I would therefore please request a reply as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nG P/JA\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE TO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE SEE CURRENT VOLUME\nDEC 31 1946\nNOV 29 1947\n\nCARADOC DAY SCHOOL\nBUILDINGS ACCOUNTS.\n\nCLOSED DECEMBER 12 1947\n\nSEE VOLUME 3\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6208)\n\nFile 468-5, part 10\nCaradoc Agency - Mount Elgin Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts - General Administration - School Establishment. 1945 - 1947.\n\nFile 468-5, part 10A\nCaradoc Agency - Mount Elgin Industrial School - Application Construction Inspector. 1912 - 1915.\n\nFile 468-5, part 10B\nCaradoc Agency - Mount Elgin Industrial School - Insurance. 1896 - 1935.\n\nFile 468-5, part 11\nCaradoc Agency - Mount Elgin Day School - School Establishment - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts - General Administration. 1946 - 1947.\n\nFile 468-5, part 12\nCaradoc Agency - Mount Elgin Day School - School Establishment - General Administration - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1946 - 1947.\n\nFile 468-5, part 13\nCaradoc Agency - Mount Elgin Day School - School Establishment - General Administration - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts - Photos - Plans. 1947 - 1948.\n\nFile 468-5, part 14\nCaradoc Agency - Mount Elgin Day School - School Establishment - General Administration - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts - Photo - Plans. 1947 - 1949.\n\nFile 468-5, part 15\nCaradoc Agency - Mount Elgin Day School - General Administration - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1949.\n| Date       | Description | Amount |\n|------------|-------------|--------|\n| PA         |             |        |\n| 33-8/18    |             |        |\n| 41/48      |             |        |\n| 11-3-48    |             |        |\n| 12-8-48    |             |        |\n| 16-3-48    |             |        |\n| 17-5-48    |             |        |\n| 21-6-48    |             |        |\n| 7-7-5      |             |        |\n| 2-8-49     |             |        |\n| 17-4-48    |             |        |\n| 21-4-48    |             |        |\n| 23-4-48    |             |        |\n| 22-1-48    |             |        |\n\nDO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nDecember 3, 1947.\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa, (File 709-5)\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\n516 ALLOTMENT 12-415 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nMr. George W.
