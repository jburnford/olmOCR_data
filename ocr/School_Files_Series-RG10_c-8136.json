Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nYour Ref. 1-1-LX (E)\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nI first want to apologise for the delay in replying to your letter of the 23rd ultimo. The reason for this is that I am at present preparing my accounts for Audit and have, therefore, little leisure for my own affairs.\n\nThank you for forwarding application form for employment as an Indian Day School Teacher. Before completing this document, I wondered if I might have your further advice. I think I pointed out in my letter to Reverend Father Scheffer that I had not actually held any official teaching appointment and because of this I feel that you may not consider my case. It is true that I have taken charge of a class in the absence of a teacher at College on several occasions, and I have from time to time taught English and Latin grammar privately together with some commercial subjects, but I cannot answer question LV to the extent that you may require. It must be some years since I attended any summer schools in England, and I just cannot submit any Inspector's reports. I have always had the desire to teach, but circumstances have not been in my favour. The possibility of being able to teach in the Indian Schools strongly appeals to me, especially as there is the spirit of Missionary work in this field. If you will consider these points together with the facts I have stated in my letter to Reverend Father Scheffer and let me know whether I may be considered a suitable candidate for this work, I will be most grateful. For my part I know I would be a happy and successful teacher, yet I realise that you have certain standards, and because of this, I am very reluctant to waste your time if I am unable to fulfil the required conditions.\n\nWith renewed thanks.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard Callaghan\nJune 23, 1950.\n\nMr. Bernard Callaghan,\n1 Kennedy Street,\nBrantford, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Callaghan:\n\nI have received your letter of June 10 forwarded to me by Father Scherrer. We are primarily interested in teachers holding teaching certificates granted by Provincial Departments of Education. We also accept teachers holding certificates granted by the Ministry of Education in England.\n\nPlease complete the attached application form and forward it here so that we may have further details of your qualifications and experience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n1, Kennedy Street,\nBRANTFORD,\nOntario.\n\nJune 10th, 1950\n\nThe Very Reverend Philip Scheffer, O. M. I.,\n340, Provenchel Avenue,\nSt. Boniface,\nManitoba.\n\nDear Very Reverend Father Provincial,\n\nHaving read your advertisement in today's issue of The Ensign for Teachers for Indian Schools, I am interested in this vocational work and wish to offer myself as a candidate.\n\nFor your guidance I beg to submit the following brief outline of my background and education.\n\nAfter leaving school I continued studies in the field of commerce and was awarded certificates in Accounts and other commercial subjects under the Institutes of Lancashire and Cheshire, England. In 1928, feeling I had a call to the Religious life, I commenced a course of private studies in preparation, and in 1929 was accepted as a student by the Salesian Congregation, first at their Missionary College at St. Rileigh, Cheshire, and finally at Pallaskenny, Co. Limerick, Ireland. I have followed a course of studies for the teaching profession, for all Salesians (or Sons of John Bosco, as they are now called) usually serve for three years after completing their studies in Philosophy. In 1932 I found I was unable to embrace the Religious State, and returning home, entered business once again and took up voluntary social work in the Salford Diocese.\n\nI feel I ought to give some further details of my family. I lost my mother in 1935, and my father is still living, aged 84. All my family are excellent practicing Catholics. I have four brothers; the eldest a prominent member of S.V.P. in the Manchester Council of the Salford Diocese, another elder brother in Stockport, Cheshire, and yet another elder brother in Brazil - Rio de Janeiro. My youngest brother is Reverend Brother Serenus of the De La Salle Brothers and he is Sub-Director of the Catholic Grammar School, St. Helena, Lancashire in the Archdiocese of Liverpool. I have two sisters, both of whom are married and reside in the vicinity of Stockport, Cheshire.\n\nI have with me, testimonials from the Rector of the Salesian Missionary College, Pallaskenny, Reverend Brother Columba of the De La Salle Congregation who is Headmaster of the Salford Diocesan Training College for Catholic Teachers, Hopwood Hall, Middleton, Lancashire. My family is well known to the present Bishop of Salford, The Rt. Reverend Msgr. H. V. Marshall. I also have in my possession a personal recommendation from the Grand\nThe Very Reverend Philip Scheffer, O.M.I. continued\n\nPresident of the Catenian Association of England, an Association of Catholic business and professional men of which I am still an overseas member.\n\nI served for a period in the late war in the Army and after my discharge took an appointment in the Local Government Service and was attached to the permanent staff (clerical) of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Office in the Borough of Worthing, Sussex. I resigned this position to emigrate to Canada in February 1949.\n\nI am married and have an excellent Catholic wife and a small daughter aged seven. Another dear member of my family is an aunt who emigrated with us.\n\nAt present I am employed in a permanent post with a Co-operative in the farming industry and have charge of accounts, being office manager and assistant manager.\n\nThe work of education strongly appeals to me and in this sphere I feel I could serve my new country in the very best way possible. The subjects I could teach best would be English, lower mathematics, accounts, Pitman's Shorthand. I have a good knowledge of Latin Grammar and would welcome in a very special way any opportunity to spread the word of God.\n\nTrusting that you will consider my application favourably.\n\nI remain, Very Reverend Father,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nBernard Callaghan.\nJuly 12, 1950.\n\nMr. Bernard Callaghan,\n1 Kennedy Street,\nBrentford, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Callaghan:\n\nI have for answer your letter of July 6, and we are placing your name on our list of applicants who are not fully qualified teachers.\n\nIf a vacancy occurs which we can not fill with a qualified teacher, then I will write to you concerning it.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBFN/AM\n\n[Signature]\nMr. J Pratt,\nChief Administrative Officer,\nDept. C L\nJuly 12, 1950.\n\nMiss B. Fortier,\n113 Spadina Road,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nThe Personnel officer of our Department has shown me your Civil Service application form and I am therefore writing to you concerning a teaching position in one of our Indian schools. We require the services of Catholic teachers for day schools near Red Deer, Alberta, and near St. Paul, Alberta. If you have a First Class Teaching Certificate and five years of provincial experience the starting salary is $226.00 a teaching month for a ten month year.\n\nI would be pleased to hear from you if you are interested in one of these teaching positions. If you are instead interested in a position as a dietitian, please let me know so that your application can be passed to the Department of National Health and Welfare.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nJuly 10, 1950.\n\nMrs. Ethel M. McDougall,\nP.O. Box 1438,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nMy dear Mrs. McDougall:\n\nYour letter of July 6 was delivered this morning and I must confirm the fact that there are very few schools available now as we made a drive before the end of the term so that we would have a staff guaranteed for the next academic year.\n\nThere is still, however, a vacancy at Chassawawin (Cedar Lake) south-east of The Pas and about 40 minutes by air.\n\nA new school is projected near Kamsack, Saskatchewan, but the site of it has not yet been finalized. The Regional Supervisor at Regina, Mr. J.P.B. Ostrander, might know of vacancies that arise through teachers changing their minds.\n\nI had hoped that additional facilities would ready at Portage la Prairie so that the load on our teachers would be lighter.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nC.A.F. Clark,\nEducational Survey Officer.\nPortage la Prairie, Man.,\nJuly 6th 1950\n\nEducational Survey, Indian Affairs,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Clark,\n\nHave you any Day Schools available in Manitoba or Sask., which are not too inaccessible? I have been teaching here for three years and think I am due for a change. I applied last year but Mr. Best was so late in giving me an appointment that I accepted Mr. McLean's offer to stay on here. This spring he promised me a school at Grey Lake was mentioned, but he has filled that opening with a married couple. Now he has nothing to offer. Would you let me know what is available? I will be here till the end of July.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nEdith M. McCaughan\nLa Corey, Alta\nJuly 7, 1950\n\nMr. Bernard Henry\nSup.\nIndian Education Branch\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nA few months before the end of June term, I was asked to think for the year comming in Tunneyville School (Indian Reserve). It will be up to you to judge about it and your decision will be mine.\n\nI have over 25 years of teaching experience in Quebec and two in Alberta schools. As far as 1948 I was in Community. I taught two years in normal school and in few other schools from grade 1 to 11.\nasked to teach grade 12. I was transferred to another school where I have been principal for two years. This has stopped me in my studies. I was aiming to M.A.\n\nI attended the University of Quebec and Montreal for this purpose. Now I am teaching in Alberta upon a letter of authority and a certificate which number is 38424. This allows me to teach from grade 1 to 8 in English.\n\nGurneyville School is far away. It will be more expensive for me to teach there. This is the reason why I kindly ask you for the salary of $200.00 a year.\n\nExpecting to have an affirmative answer I remain your very thankful\n\nWilfred Broussard\nTeacher of Beaver School\nLa Crete, Alta\nMr Bernard Neary, Supt\nIndian Education Branch\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont\n\nDear Mr Neary,\n\nIn as far as I can see Mr Wilbrod Borsseau has got the qualification of a very good school teacher in view of his own schooling and ability with the children. With the enclosed he has written himself and you will judge by yourself.\n\nI particularly want to stress the fact that he is a convinced catholic and such a man we need to make the catechism classes interesting and instructive. Besides him and his wife can direct the children as well as their parents in many ways.\n\nConsidering that he will be accepted and given a decent salary\n\nI remain, dear Sir,\n\nYours very truly in C.J. and M.I.\n\n[Signature]\n\n1-1-17\nJuly 1st, 1955\nJuly 17, 1950.\n\nMr. W.

I have also had several years experience in office work, accounting, selling etc.\n\nFor the past two years I have been teaching English to high school and intermediate boys and girls (grades 5-11) in a French school.\n\nI shall be very pleased if you consider my application favorably.\n\nYours truly,\nThomas Lafortune.\n133 Lewis Ave., Westmount,\nMontreal 6, P.Q.\n\nJuly 15, 1950.\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\n\n220 Queen Street,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to apply for the position of teacher (English Catholic teacher) for Indian Day schools, preferably in B.C.\n\nI am a Catholic, English speaking, qualified teacher, male. I have one son aged 7. I am 43 years old, have had fifteen years teaching experience and several years experience in office work, accounting, selling, etc.\n\nFor the past two years I have been teaching English to French pupils, boys and girls, from grades 5 to 11.\n\nI shall be very pleased if you give my application favorable consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThomas Lefontaine.\nJuly 10, 1950\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Education\n220 Queen Street,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nDo you employ unqualified teachers in your Indian Day Schools? If so I would like to know why.\n\nI have Commercial Training and Supervision, also nursing experience, and teaching experience in public schools and in two Western Canada Residential Church Schools during past year.\n\nThe idea of a teacherage appeals to me if not too far from a railway.\n\nThe Provincial Inspector passed my Grade VIII Ontario pupils this year and told me I am \"doing fine.\"\n\nI have no experience alone among Indians, but if the parents would see that they come regularly to school I think I might do better work among them than where they only could for half day periods.\n\nI shall go back to a church school next fall unless I could make some more satisfactory arrangement for a day school with the Village.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nMrs. A.

Philip Scheffer, O.M.I.\nProvincial of the Oblates\nSt Boniface, Man.\n\nVery Reverend Father,\n\nI am writing to you with regard to a notice in the Ensign of 10 June on the need for Teachers in Indian Schools. I have wondered if I could be considered for an appointment.\n\nSince March, 1949, I have taught as a substitute teacher in schools of the Montreal Catholic School Commission. I am eligible to qualify as a permanent teacher with the Commission as I have not taken the Normal School course.\nI was educated privately at Merchant Taylors' School, Hertfordshire, England and took Responsions at Oxford University in 1937. From 1939 to 1946 I served as an officer in the Gurkha Brigade of the Indian Army, becoming a Major on the General Staff in 1944. From 1947 to 1948 I served as an executive on the civil staff of the British Intelligence Division of the Control Commission, Germany. I came to Canada in March, 1949.\n\nIt is possible that I may get an appointment as history teacher at Loyola High School, Montreal, in September.\n\nI am able to travel any reasonable distance for an interview.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.H.

In the following\nI hope to hear from you in the immediate future and you may address your letter to my home.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n(Mrs) Ivan Kelly,\nCaribou\nBurn District\nPlacentia Bay\nNfld\n\nyear I attended Memorial University College, St. John's where I successfully passed the Teacher Training course. This was in 1945 and I have been teaching 4 years. Last year I was Principal of a 3 Room School at Fox Harbour P.E.I. under the Chairmanship of Rev. Bathie Collins & for the 3 years previous I taught in Burn District under Rev. Bathie Hunt. You may obtain references to my character etc from either of the above.\n\nI am interested in teaching High School and I would like to have some information regarding these schools.\nVery Sir,\n\nPlease inform me of the following:\n\n1.

I have had five years experience in teaching Indians in the early twenties and would like to go back to that work. If you should have a junior grade or a school where the pupils are not too far advanced being away from teaching all these years, I prefer starting with the lower grades.\n\nNow if you should not have a school, I am wondering if you have some kind of light work doing serving in a hospital at Moose Jaw, or any other position a woman of my age (48 years) could do.\n\nI am Yours very Truly,\nMiss Angela Dunlop,\n171 Sixth Ave., Timmins.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nThere is attached hereto copy of a letter from Miss Edna Gillmore, 46 Elliott Street, Brampton, and a former teacher at the Ryerson Indian Day School, applying for a position in an Indian school. I have been given to understand that Miss Gillmore did good work while at the aforementioned school and if you have an opening for her you might forward her the necessary application forms.\n\nWard L. Leroy,\nIndian Superintendent.\n46 Elliott St.,\nBrampton, Ont.,\nJuly 15, 1950.\n\nDear Mr. Devlin:\n\nYou may remember that I taught for a short while in the Indian Reserve school on Perry Island in 1946. Later, you offered me the position again. I felt at the time that I could not accept it.\n\nNow, however, if there is a vacancy, or any possibility of a vacancy in the future, I feel I might take on the work again. I have never lost my interest in the Indians. If there is no opening at present, perhaps you might keep me in mind for some later time.\n\nThank you and please give my best regards to my Indian friends.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEdna Gillmore.\nHogansburg New York\nJuly 18, 1950.\n\nCol.

He had been with the provincial police for 27 years serving as district inspector at Kitchener and Belleville respectively.

We have a day school available on Michel Indian Reserve, about 20-25 miles north-east of Edmonton. It is a new building with teacher's quarters attached and requires a Catholic teacher.\n\nWe have a school available on the Saddle Lake Reserve about 15 miles west of St. Paul, with separate accommodation near at hand. This school requires a Catholic teacher.\n\nWe have another school available on Long Lake Reserve, about 40 miles north-east of St. Paul, Alberta. This is a new school with attached teacher's quarters and requires a Catholic teacher.\n\nWe have a two-room school at Whitefish Lake, which is from 40-50 miles north of Lesser Slave Lake, which requires a Protestant (preferably Anglican) teacher. This used to be a residential school but will be conducted as a two-room day school for this year. We have employed the second teacher and we hope to erect a new school next year.\n\nI am attaching application forms and copy of the teachers' salary schedule. If you are interested in applying please send your application direct to Colonel B.F. Henry, Sup't. of Education, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, who will receive a copy of this letter.\n\nWith regard to qualifications, we prefer to employ teachers with a first-class certificate, and we are quite prepared to accept a teacher who has just graduated from Normal.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRegional Superintendent Agencies\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nAttn: Superintendent of Education\n\nRe: Teachers\n\nWe have had some response to the advertisement you recently placed in the Calgary Herald.\n\n(1) I am attaching an application form received from Mr. R. A. Gulliver, Okotoks, Alberta. Mr. Gulliver is single and is primarily interested in going north of the 56th base line where he would qualify for the Northern Allowance. In fact I know of no school where he could be assigned south of the 56th base line where he would receive a salary commensurate with his qualifications. Whitefish Lake, where another Anglican teacher is required, would have been ideal except that there is already a single female teacher there, leaving the problem of accommodation, and also the area is just south of the 56th base line. I should say that Mr. Gulliver made a very good first impression. He is awaiting advice as to the salary which he would receive.\n\n(2) I am attaching copy of a letter received from Miss Orna McTaggart of Glenboro, Manitoba, and a copy of my reply.\n\n(3) While on the subject of teachers, Mr. O.E. Smith of Irvine, Alberta, was just in this office. He is President of the Southern Local of the Alberta Teachers Association and is Principal of a six-room school at Irvine. Last year you corresponded with him regarding the Brocket school and also advised him that you might later be in a position to offer him a principalship at the Hobbema Day School. Mr. Smith stated that there appeared to be two major obstacles standing in the way of our obtaining good and sufficient teachers for the Indian Service (s) as an example, if a first-class teacher with ten years' experience applies for a position, invariably\nis placed in the Grade Three salary bracket for the sixth year, that is $2280.00. Mr. Smith states that it would be preferable if he could be placed in the bracket for the tenth year; (b) teachers with considerable experience in Alberta schools have naturally built up a sizeable credit in their teacher's retirement or superannuation fund. When such teachers enter the Indian Service they have only one alternative and that is to accept a cash settlement for their credit in the Fund. If some method could be found to have this credit transferred to the Dominion Civil Servants' Superannuation Fund thus giving the teachers credit for their years of service in Provincial schools, we would have less difficulty in obtaining first-class teachers.\n\nMr. Smith is interested in entering our Service but he does not feel justified in accepting a large salary reduction from the $3400.00 per annum he now receives. He will, however, make application for the position of school inspector when and if advertised.\n\nYour comments on the above would be appreciated as I have promised to write to Mr. Smith.\n\nfor G.H.

I prefer the north.

Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n316 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Your letter of November 17 and 29\n\nMr. Mark Howard of Goose Bay, Labrador, is the only applicant for the above school who has completed an application form. He would be entitled to classification as a Grade I teacher at a salary of $1,500.00 an academic year with credit for two years of experience in residential schools. He has no teaching certificate. When you write to him giving him the necessary details of the school, you might quote the above salary and ascertain whether he is definitely interested in accepting the position. He would, of course, have to pay his own transportation expenses.\n\nAn alternative applicant is Mr. Walter M. Reddy who is now employed as a Boys' Supervisor at the Cross Lake Residential School. We have no application form from him, but from the information given in his letter of application, we would conclude that he is entitled to classification as a Grade I teacher at the minimum salary of $1,500.00 an academic year. Would it be possible for you to have him interviewed and determine his suitability?\n\nWe have received no application form from Mr. Thomas A. Maloney mentioned in your letter of November 16.\n\nPhilip Nelson,\nChief, Education Division.\n2423 Dalhousie St., Victoria B.C., Dec. 7/50.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nBeing a 1st class teacher of both Sask. & B.C., also graduate of Anglican Training College, Toronto, with part of the B.C. specialist music course, I have been asked by Miss Edgar, Principal, Anglican T. College, to get particulars from you re the salaries, requirements etc. of teachers in Indian Schools; at:\n\n1. St. George James Bay\n2. Cardston\n3. Lytton\n\nAlso, as I am 68 years of age how long would I be allowed to teach?\n\nMy father died at 92 on Oct. 13/50\u2014my mother is 80 years of age with a weak heart. When I am no longer needed, I'd like to go at once to some position, even in\nthe middle of the term.\n\nAlso, give information re holidays as I have my own cottage on Salt Spring Island.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nAnnie Ripley.\nDear Miss Ripley,\n\nI was very pleased to get your letter a few days ago but I am sorry to hear that you have lost your father. What a wonderful long life he must have had! Not many people live to his great age nowadays. Did he have good health most of the latter years?\n\nYou and your sister who is a nurse must have been a great comfort to your mother during his last illness. I hope that your mother is keeping well.\n\nYou ask about full time church work. Have you thought about Indian school work? There is a most urgent need for a person with your training and ability in an Indian school. We receive really heart-breaking letters from our workers in these schools, telling of the shortage of teachers and other workers and how they are trying to carry on doing two and even three people's work.\n\nThe most recent letter describing this situation was from Bessie Quirt at the school in Fort George, on James Bay. Another recent letter was from a graduate of two years from Wabasca in the Diocese of Athabasca. She was having to do her work as a supervisor and besides that had to teach school in the mornings although she was not a trained teacher. She said that she was so busy that it was almost impossible for her to keep one lesson ahead of the class. In the afternoons the principal had to take on the class.\n\nThis is not an isolated condition. It happens in so many of our schools. Could you not give a year or two to this work?\nI expect that Lytton would be your nearest school but there three in Southern Alberta\u2014at Cardston, Brocket and Gleichen. I have visited all three of these schools. You would be making a wonderful contribution to the work of the church if you would do something like this. It is hard work, I know, but no church work is easy.\n\nThere must be great changes in the college since you were a student. Have you been back to Toronto recently? There are thirty-two students and fifteen who have their degrees from universities. We have new dormitories and a new wing is now being built between the two. We shall have a fine place when this is finished.\n\nI wish you all joy and happiness in whatever work you undertake.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA. Edgar\nPrincipal\nDecember 13, 1950\n\nMiss Annie Ripley,\n2483 Dalhousie Street,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Miss Ripley:\n\nWe are pleased to note from your letter of December 7 that you are interested in teaching in one of our schools.\n\nThe salaries paid to our teachers are based on the salary schedule approved by Order-in-Council. A teacher with a First Class Certificate is classified as a Teacher, School, Grade IX. If she has at least five complete years of experience her salary is set at $2,250 an academic year.\n\nOur teachers retire at 65 years of age.\n\nIn most cases there is a teacherage attached to the school, and free house, fuel and light are provided.\n\nThe schools you mention at Fort George, Cardston, Brockat, Gleichen and Lytton are residential schools and we do not pay the teachers' salaries. You may if you wish, write to the Principals of these residential schools.\n\nIf, however, you are interested in an Indian day school in the Province of British Columbia, we would suggest that you write to Mr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C., to whom we are sending a copy of this letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nBlind River, Ont.\nDecember 9th, 1950\n\nMr. B. F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to inform you that shortly after I received your letter of May 12th, I wrote Mr. Sutherland to ask him if he intended to return to Goulais Bay in September. I waited all summer for an answer.\n\nTwo weeks ago I learned that he did not return, and I regret it very much that he did not inform me of his decision.\n\nHaving known that he would not return I would have written to Miss McNulty to ask her if she would take that school now, for she wanted to be transferred to Goulais Bay while I was there.\n\nThe reason why I did not want to exchange schools with her then was because the late Father Jim Dwyer S.J. did not want me to leave Goulais Bay School.\nI am not against returning to that school, as I esteem the people there very highly, and the children are very good. I needed a rest from the place as I had worked hard while there.\n\nI had taught the children how to knit, sew and cook, besides all the social work I did that the letters I sent you testified. It was also through my untiring efforts that rural mail was granted to Conlao Mission.\n\nI was only nineteen when I entered an Indian school and I threw myself heart and soul into the work. I still ardently desire to return.\n\nI would appreciate very sincerely if you would keep my name on your list, and if you are willing to have any services I would be glad to fill any vacancy.\n\nContrary to all expectations, my sick sister is improving.\n\nNumerous prayers were offered for her recovery by the mission, and all her friends here also esteem her very highly.\n\nI take this opportunity to wish you a very Merry Christmas.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nSusan A.

We are now in the Copeland Building on Albert Street.\n\nAt Moose Factory and other summer schools there have not been as many vacancies as might be supposed because the Department tries to encourage such workers to return in consecutive years and of course an attempt is always made to obtain personnel with professional training and experience.\n\nOften theological students are recommended for this employment by bishops of dioceses situated in the northland, e.g., Bishop Benson and Bishop Lefthouse. The travelling expenses which a teacher is required to pay are rather considerable for short-term employment and during your limited vacation you want to accumulate as much money as possible. There may well be alternative employments which would not require travelling expenses.\n\nAs Bishop Benson is often in Toronto, you might enquire from him whether all his outposts are sure to be staffed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.A.F.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Catholic Teachers for British Columbia\nYour File 208/2-32\n\nWe received your letter of March 29th with reference to the schools in British Columbia at which a Catholic teacher is required.\n\nWe have not yet made any appointment of an Inspector for the Maritime Provinces. However, I have written to Msgr. Mackey, but have not yet received a reply.\n\nThis week we are placing an advertisement in \"The Ensign\", the Catholic weekly, which covers all provinces and it is hoped that we will obtain some applicants.\n\nWe will certainly keep your requirements in mind, and do everything possible to secure teachers.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMarch 29, 1951.\n\nRe: Catholic Teachers for British Columbia.\n\nOn the occasion of Mr. Neary's visit to British Columbia it was suggested that when a School Inspector was appointed for the Maritime Provinces he be requested to endeavour to locate Catholic Teachers for the Indian Day Schools in this province. As the Department is aware, it is very difficult to secure the services of Teachers with Catholic affiliations for the schools of this province. Any action which the Department is able to take towards filling this need will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThe following list and description will perhaps assist the Department in meeting this need. Only schools where it is now known vacancies will occur have been listed and it is anticipated that other vacancies will become known at a later date:\n\n1. MORICETOWN: This will be a new 2-room school the construction of which, it is expected, will start shortly. The present Teacher, Miss Joan Adams, is a Protestant and has been employed only until the end of the present term. Two Teachers will therefore be required at this point. The school is located on the Northern branch of the C.N.R., about 20 miles West of the white community of Smithers. Smithers is a town with a population of approximately 1000. Moricetown is also served by telephone and the Prince George - Prince Rupert Highway.\n\n2. OKANAGAN: A second room will be added to this school in September. The school will then consist of two separate buildings, each with living quarters. It is located some 16 miles from Vernon, to which it is connected by a good road. The present Teachers are both unqualified and should be replaced for the term commencing September 1951.\n3. IRISH CREEK: This is a new one-room school with attached living quarters, located 10 miles from Vernon on the same Reserve as the Okanagan school. One Teacher will be required.\n\n4. INKAMBEPE: A new one-room school is now under construction at this point which will replace the very unsatisfactory building now being used. The work of the present teacher is unsatisfactory and he should be replaced.\n\n5. ROCHER DEBOULE: It is anticipated that it will be possible to abandon the use of the rented log building with the construction of a new one-room school with attached Teacherage. The materials for this building are already on hand in the Babine Agency. The present Teacher, Mr. George Thiessen, is an excellent Teacher who has given complete satisfaction to the Department. He is, however, a Protestant and if a satisfactory replacement can be secured he should be transferred to a Protestant school. I would not suggest this transfer if I were not confident that the new school will be built, otherwise it would be difficult to retain the services of a satisfactory Teacher in view of the disgraceful condition of the existing building. The Rocher Deboule school is located three miles from the white community of Hazelton to which it is connected by a good road.\n\n6. NASKAINILITH: The Department will recall correspondence concerning the work of Sister Patricia and Mr. Davey's recommendation that she be transferred to some school outside this Province. It is anticipated that the Department will be acting upon this recommendation which will create a vacancy for one Teacher at this point. The Naskainilith School is located approximately six miles from Chase. The building was constructed in 1949.\n\nIt will be noted from the above that at least eight Catholic Teachers will be required in this province.\n\nIf the appointment of an Inspector for the Maritime Provinces has not been made, it is suggested that Msgr. Mackey at Shubenacadie be contacted, although this office would prefer to secure teachers through Departmental officials.\n\nW.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nApril 23, 1951.\n\nMr. Harcourt T. Johnston,\nMindemoya, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Johnston:\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 16th instant with reference to appointment as teacher in a seasonal school in northern Ontario.\n\nWe have secured teachers for the places where seasonal teachers are employed, and under the circumstances, I regret that there is no vacancy available at the present time.\n\nIf you are still interested next year, you might write to us early in March.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nMindemoya, Ont.\nApril 16, 1951\n\nThe Deputy Minister\nDept. of Citizenship\nand Immigration\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear sir:\n\nI would like to introduce myself as a high school teacher here in Mindemoya on the island of Manitoulin. This letter is to indicate my desire for employment during the summer months, if that is possible, among either the Indians or Eskimos in one of the outlying areas of Canada.\n\nI have a B.A. degree from McGill University and seventeen years teaching experience, fifteen in public school and four in high school. A number of years ago I\ntaught in the Red Lake district where I came into contact with many Indians and found them easy and pleasant to work with. So the thought has come to me that I would like to go back this summer to teach or do anything that my education and experience qualifies me to do.\n\nWould you please inform me at your earliest convenience if there are any opportunities in this line of work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHarcourt T. Johnston.\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nReference your letter of 29th ultimo, file 1-1-IX (E7), re teachers employed in the schools of the Yukon Agency.\n\nI beg to advise that all teachers with one exception have signified their intention of returning to the service for the academic year 1951-52.\n\nThe exception is Miss L. Farley, Arts teacher, Whitehorse Indian Day School, who states she is unable to give a definite reply at the present, but will let me know as soon as she is able.\n\nH.E.

Mackey:\n\nWe have vacancies in 8 or 9 of our Indian Day Schools in British Columbia for Catholic teachers. Indian Commissioner Arnell has just written to us, stating that it is difficult to secure these teachers in British Columbia.\n\nWould you know of any teachers in the Maritimes who might be interested in appointment at these schools, and if so, would you let us know the best method of reaching them. As you know, our salary rates compare favourably with those paid in provincial schools, and at the day schools in British Columbia there are suitable living quarters attached to the school.\n\nThe teacher would be obliged to pay transportation to the school, as we are not allowed to provide this.\n\nI trust this letter finds you enjoying good health. Kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nMay 14th, 1951.\n\nMr. L.G.P. Waller,\nRegional Inspector of Indian Schools,\n620 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Waller:\n\nRe: Teacher Vacancies\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, the King's Printer has been requested to insert in newspapers throughout Canada, advertisements for teachers for our schools. These advertisements should appear either at the end of this week or the first part of next week.\n\nThis does not prevent your advising us of any possible teachers with whom you are acquainted. Under separate cover we are forwarding you a supply of application forms which should be completed and returned by any applicants. Of course, in the case of those whom you know, it would be advisable to let us have your recommendation, and no doubt if there are others with whom you are not personally acquainted, you will make inquiries and let us have your opinion.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n620 Public Building,\nCALGARY, Alberta\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS May 8, 1951.\n\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Teacher Vacancies,\n\nSince several appointments to Indian day schools in Alberta will be made this summer, may we have your permission to have an advertisement in the Edmonton and Calgary daily newspapers, asking for applications from teachers wanting situations? An advertisement of this nature would, in all probability, give publicity to the wage-scale now offered, which compares very favorably with that of most of the Alberta school divisions. If the response is as good as we anticipate, we should be in a position to select the best teachers for the vacancies on hand.\n\nThe advertisement would mention no particular schools but would state wage-scales, accommodation, community work and religious qualifications, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.\n\nIt is understood that Grade III teachers will be employed wherever possible.\n\nL.G.

In 1946 I graduated from Barnard College, Columbia Univ. Since then I have taught various high school and grade school subjects. In 1947 I entered Carmel in Concord, New Hampshire, but after a short time, Reverend Mother advised that I leave. She said she thought I could not find my way to God through the particular way of life of Carmel. Since my leaving Carmel, Reverend Mother has continued her kindness and help to me. I still desire the poverty and spirit of Carmel, and my director has suggested that my vocation may be found in my teaching and living in a poor rural area. I do not care about earning money, but I would like to be near a mission church.\n\nIf you could tell me anything about the possibilities\nof any need for a teacher in any of your missions. I would be very, very thankful.\n\nMost respectfully and gratefully,\n\nSusan Weaver\nMay 18th, 1951.\n\nMr. George F. Campbell,\nP.O.

Biehl I visited the London Normal School this morning and spoke to his students at Assembly. Quite a group seem interested. I was surprised myself at the number. They made out these slips. I saw each one personally and then had a brief session with Mr. Biehl. As he went over the records I jotted down some comments on the slips.\n\nMay application forms be sent to these people, please? They should be sent to them at The Normal School, Elmwood Ave., London, Ont. I asked the students to put their home address on the slip of paper so we might have it if needed in the summer.\n\nThere are two Roman Catholic students there I should like to have for Manitoulin. They are both above average. Could we promise to place these people now? I feel if we wait we shall lose them, there are so many school boards after teachers at present. I did not promise anything but said we could not tell until the first week in June. However, if we could assure these folk of employment in Sept. even if we are not sure of the school we would know they would not sign contracts elsewhere. If you feel you can do that would you be good enough to write to them.\n\nI hope this all meets with your approval.\n\nSincerely,\n\nH. G.

The requirements for teachers is synonymous with that of the province in which the school is located.\n\nWe are mainly interested in applications from teachers who hold a teaching certificate granted by a Department of Education, and the salary and classification of each teacher is dependent upon the certificate held and the number of years of experience.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n17, Ashwood Villas,\nHeadingley Lane,\nLeeds, S.

This letter is largely in the nature of an enquiry, since there is possibility that my husband may come to work in Canada.\n\nMy main reason for writing to you is my interest in the Indian people. For twenty years I have read about them, and I should welcome an opportunity to work among them. I realise that my interest has been confined to books only, but I have endeavoured to study their history and present day life as widely as has been possible. At the moment I am reading books supplied by the American Embassy Library, which cover a good deal of ground, but, of course, my knowledge of actual conditions is comparatively small. I think first of teaching as a possible line of work, but I am very uncertain about my academic qualifications being sufficient for work of this kind. At present I am teaching in a Modern Secondary School, where I specialise in Art; my qualifications, however, are only those of a teacher trained in an Emergency Training College after a year's study and two years' supervised work in school, after which I was awarded a teaching certificate giving me full status. Before I was married in the Women's Air Force, I worked for five years as a secretary, my position was considered too important suddenly, and I am afraid that, under these circumstances, I did not sit for a School Certificate Examination. I regret, therefore, that there is little beyond my sincere interest that I can offer you, but I should be pleased to hear whether there is a possibility of finding work in connection with Indian people, whether this were teaching or some other kind of work for which my experience might be adequate.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nKathleen M.

George Dorsey, B.A., D.D.,\nSecretary of Board of Home Missions,\n299 Queen St.,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nThis Branch does not appoint the teachers employed in Indian Residential Schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nBY AIR MAIL\n\nAIR LETTER\n\nIF ANYTHING IS ENCLOSED THIS LETTER WILL BE SENT BY ORDINARY MAIL.\n\n[Handwritten text]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Residential Schools Commission\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO\nCanada\n\n[Handwritten text]\n\n[Handwritten text]\n\n[Handwritten text]\nFebruary 12th\n\nAmport, 1/1\n\nAndover\n\nHants.\n\nI have thus far not replied.\n\nInside of address, left blanking, was an address individually. I am writing to inquire if you have any suggestion to offer of any kind of post in one of the Indian Residential Schools. I worked for a number of years (or not since 1929) with the Western Canada Caravan Mission, under Miss Hassell, and my heart is still in the mission field\u2014though I think perhaps the time has come to undertake something which requires a little less physical and just than the constant camping involved in the Caravan Mission. I worked practically all the time in the Diocese of New Westminster, where actually I have a great many friends now. During the first few years of my work there, the late Archbishop de Laveaux invited me to go to the Indian School at Kingscome Inlet, but it was then disappointing. I had to refuse it as I was obliged to return to England for family reasons. I once visited the Joseph School at Lytton, when I was in the Cariboo District, and once stayed a few days at Old Sun School at Skeetch, while the new school house\n\nI was principal. In fact, I recently addressed an enquiry to him, but the letter was returned marked \"deceased.\" However, I say I had not known of this. The late Archbishop de Laveaux, former Secretary in Vancouver, suggested that I should now write to this address.\n\nI received my training in Religious Education through St. Christopher's College, London, England. Actually, I have a passage booked to Canada in the middle of May, as my brother who lives in Toronto is always ready to receive me in his house, but I really wish to go for a definite missionary purpose and am not concerned about any specific salary, though I agree that some arrangement might be made as regards the minimum of expenses (after reaching Canada).\n\nAnd \"Keep\" if I undertake any work in connection with any of the mission schools.\n\nIf you have any suggestion to offer, I would naturally like to hear at your first convenience, as time does seem to slip away.\n\nSincerely yours, in His service,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Note: The handwriting is difficult to read.]\nMay 25, 1951.\n\nMiss G.

Therefore I wondered at the possibility of teaching a year first.\n\nI am a graduate of the Brevoort Bible Institute, in Saskatchewan, having completed a four-year course in the spring of 1948. Since then I have been engaged in missionary work which has involved a considerable amount of teaching technique.\n\nI would appreciate any information you could give me on this subject at your earliest convenience.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Mrs.) Ethel R.

In June and afterwards attend a summer school in order to become well-grounded in B.C. teaching methods. If such a loan were granted, it would be of the understanding that I teach in a Indian School as from the end of August 1951 and repay the money at the rate of $50 monthly commencing the end of September.\n\nMy resources are very limited in teaching and\nother suitable employment is out of the question at this juncture, and the financial worry is seriously hampering me in my studies.\n\nI came to the coast for climatic reasons and hold First Class Teaching Certificate of another province. If successful in June I shall be awarded a First Class Teaching Certificate of B.C. and will also satisfy two-thirds of the requirements for the External B.A. (Economics) degree of London University. The subjects I shall take will be Arithmetic, English Language, Biology, and French (at Grade 12 level), and British Constitution, English Empire & European History, Economics, English Economic History & English Literature, at Senior Matriculation Level. I already hold an English diploma in General Hygiene (Advanced). Your reply which B.C. Education Dept. recommends schools appreciated.

Outhwaite, of Shamrock, Saskatchewan. I informed him of the salary range and stated that I would communicate with him later as soon as I had a definite school to offer.\n\nA letter was received from Mrs. Evelyn Primrose, of Baring, Saskatchewan, and application forms were sent to her with more details. When her application is received it will go forward to you for your opinion, but, from her letter I feel she is the type of Indian day school teacher that we are looking for. One fact in her favour is she has specialized in primary teaching.\n\nOn your instructions Mr. Silversides was notified by registered mail that his service would not be required after June 30th. I had written to the Reverend Gray stating that we had reliable information that he would not be returning to the Fishing Lake School, and if such was the case, would he kindly submit his resignation in order to leave the school open for appointment. I have today written to Mr. F.L. Taggart advising him of approval of his appointment, and I also informed him that while I did not have the Reverend Gray's resignation it was practically assured.\n\nIt appears to me that there are plenty of the better type of teachers who are toying with the idea of Indian day school work, but it is very difficult to make a firm offer to them at the present time. When Mr. Ostrander returns from his holidays we will know just where teachers are needed, and I am sure that one of Mr. Ostrander's first duties in the office will be to look into this matter, and from the amount of applications received I think there would be no difficulty in finding teachers.\n\nIt is hard to know when the new schools will be completed, and I do not consider it good business to get any of the teachers too interested.\nin these appointments as they might not be ready to open as soon as we anticipate.\n\nIf you have any further instructions that you wish me to carry out before Mr. Ostrander's return, please advise.\n\nJ.P.B.

However, I have had four years of training in 'Art' schools, across Canada and am a reasonably good painter. I have picked up enough craft work to be able to teach the rudiments of any craft, the school might require.\n\nI believe myself capable of teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic in a simple understandable way and so the youngsters will be able to use their learning in their daily lives.\n\nAnyway, I would very much like to have the opportunity to become a teacher of children.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(Signed) Sybil Hill\n\n(Mrs. Sybil Hill)\n\nJune 3, 1951\nJune 6th, 1951.\n\nMr. J.A.

I am a High School Teacher, holding an Interim High School Assistant's Certificate, Type B, from the Province of Ontario. Thus I would have to teach in a High School in Ontario, in order to maintain my standing and in order to attain a Permanent Certificate.\n\nFor the past school year I have been teaching French (Grades IX, X, XI), Latin (Grade XI), and English Grammar (Grade IX) at Assumption High School, Windsor.\n\nIf it would be possible for me to fit into the requirements which you put forward, I would be very interested in receiving more information.\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLouis B. Freeman\n3148 Donnelly Street,\nWindsor, Ontario.\nJune 19, 1951\n\nMr. Louis R. Freeman,\n3146 Donnelly Street,\nWindsor, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Freeman:\n\nWe are pleased to have your letter of June 13th, 1951, applying for a teaching position in an Indian Day School.\n\nWith a High School Teacher's Certificate and one year of experience teaching, you would be entitled to classification as a School Teacher Grade 3 at a salary of $1800.00 an academic year. If you hold a University degree you would receive a bonus of $120.00. Moreover, our salary rates are under revision and you would be entitled to a higher salary effective September 1st, 1951.\n\nIt is noted, however, that it is necessary for you to teach in a High school in the province of Ontario in order to maintain your standing. We regret to advise you that our school system is for grades one to eight. Higher instruction is received in provincial schools or in our residential schools. At the Spanish R.C. Indian Residential school, Indian children are taught high school work. However, teachers' salaries are negotiated by the Indian Affairs Branch, and it would be necessary for you to contact the Principal, the Reverend J.R. Oliver, S.J., Spanish, Ontario.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nAM:GFB\nDear Sir,\n\nI am a young man of 22 years. At present my ambition is to work among the Indians.

If you could help me, I would certainly be grateful. My entire youth was spent near an Indian Reserve and nothing gave me more satisfaction than to help out the poor natives.\n\nMaybe you could advise me where to obtain information as to the foregoing if you can not fill my request.\n\nYours truly,\nRon Feist.\nJune 7, 1951.\n\nMr. Dan Feist,\nMoreland,\nMountain Sanatorium,\nHamilton, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Feist:\n\nWe have received your recent letter and wish to advise you that we require our teachers to hold a teaching certificate granted by a provincial Department of Education.\n\nIt is possible that your services could be used in an Indian Residential school. However, we do not pay the salary of the staff of residential schools. If you would be interested in such a position, please let us know your religious denomination and we will endeavour to direct you to the appropriate authorities of our residential schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nAM:GFB\nJune 12, 1951\n\nMr. E.

As you perhaps are aware, it is the policy of the Department to assign teachers to Reserves where the missionary work is done by representatives of the denomination with which the teacher is affiliated.\n\nAt the present time I have a vacancy on the Catholic Reserve at Creekside. This position is in the senior room of the three room Pemberton Indian Day School. This room is housed in a separate building with attached quarters which include one bedroom, living room and kitchen. The Pemberton School is located on the P.G.E.

If your religious affiliation is Catholic I have several vacancies which might interest you; however, before I can indicate to you where these vacancies are it is necessary for me to know whether or not you are married and if so the number of dependents which would accompany you. This information is required because the teachers' accommodation is limited and at the present time I have no school where the teachers' accommodation is adequate for married teachers with children. Our teacherages normally provide one bedroom per teacher, plus kitchen, living room and bathroom where running water is available.\n\nIf this type of accommodation is suited to your requirements I would appreciate your informing me as soon as possible as to your teaching qualifications and experience. I understand that you have completed our standard application form but I assume that these have been forwarded to Ottawa and consequently are not available to me.

If you are a Catholic I have a vacancy in the primary room of the three room Pemberton Indian Day School located at Creekside on the P.G.E. Railway some 90 miles north of Vancouver. The primary room is located in a new two room block constructed three years ago. This building has attached teacherage with two bedrooms, bathroom with full plumbing, living room and kitchen. You would share this accommodation with the intermediate room teacher. I might add that this school is supplied with its own A/C 110 volt lighting plant.\n\nIf you are interested in this position will you kindly inform me as to your certification and experience. I anticipate that the primary room will enrol 25 to 30 pupils.\n\nI attach for your information a copy of our salary schedule. Increments after the third year on this schedule will depend upon the teacher having attended at least one summer session at a school of education and credit for not\nmore than five years experience can be given for service in schools other than those operated by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

Buhler, E. (E7), in connection with this office letter, File 1511/211/2-32, of June 14th, with regard to Mr. and Mrs. David J. Hunt. I naturally had Miss Le Sann in mind in making this recommendation, as I value the services of Miss Le Sann very highly. I spoke to Mr. Phelan about the future of this young lady, and there are two possibilities for her: (a) to go to the Assiniboine R.C. Day School, replacing Miss Vanaelst, who has resigned; (b) to go to another R.C. day school, perhaps in another province, as I do not know of any other vacancies suitable to her in this province.\n\nIn Father Lavigne's letter regarding Mr. and Mrs. Hunt he mentions that Mr. Hunt had been considered for the White Fish Bay School, in Ontario. Perhaps Miss Le Sann might be considered for that appointment. Mr. Phelan mentioned that there were other possibilities in other provinces, and I have no doubt that this will be arranged in due course.\n\nWith regard to filling the vacancy left at the Assiniboine School by the resignation of Miss Vanaelst I am very anxious to fill this vacancy by the appointment of Mrs. Murphy, wife of the Assistant, Indian Agency at the Assiniboine Reserve. Mrs. Murphy is an experienced school teacher, but has not taught school for a number of years. The Department is well aware of the possibility of friction if the two teachers, R.C. and United Church, live together in the small cottage which is the teacherage at that point. In order that we may avoid any possibility of friction I am very anxious that Mrs. Murphy should be appointed, as she will have her own home in which to live, and that Mrs. Silversides be transferred from the File Hills Colony School to the United Church room on the Assiniboine Reserve, in order that she and Mr. Silversides will have the small cottage to themselves.\n\nThe exchange of Mrs. Silversides with Miss May Nelson was discussed with Mr. Phelan and received his approval. This exchange will result in Mr. and Mrs. Silversides living in the small cottage with no one else to disturb their harmony, and Miss May Nelson will live in the teacherage at the\n\nFile Hills-Colony School...........\nFile Hills Colony School with Miss Eggenschwiler, which will, no doubt, be a very harmonious arrangement.\n\nA confirmation of these proposals would be appreciated.\n\nJ.P.B.

Collicou, teacher at the Brandon Hospital School and her replacement by Mrs. Lafrance.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would let us know on what date it would be convenient for Mrs. Lafrance to commence teaching duties. We have received a letter from Dr. A.H. Povah, the Medical Superintendent of the Sanatorium Board of Manitoba, Brandon, Manitoba, requesting that a replacement for Miss Collicou should not arrive until the time of Miss Collicou's departure on September 15. It is appreciated that possibly Mrs. Lafrance would prefer to commence duties on September 1 rather than September 15 but would appreciate receiving your comments in this regard before replying to Dr. Povah.\n\nWe suggest that you contact Dr. Povah and discuss the matter with him and submit a report to this office.\n\nIt would also be appreciated if you would forward us an application form completed by Mrs. Lafrance as mentioned in Mr. Davis' Army Message of June 18. Mrs. Gertrude Lafrance taught for us at the Waterhen Indian Day School during the academic year 1949-50.

Bien que je ne sois titulaire d'aucun dipl\u00f4me d'instituteur, il me semble que mon instruction peut suffire \u00e0 un enseignement primaire, pour instruire les \u00e9l\u00e8ves en s\u00e9parant le certificat d'\u00e9tudes.\n\nMa femme, fran\u00e7aise comme moi, est venue en France et enseigne depuis deux ans \u00e0 des \u00e9l\u00e8ves pr\u00e9parant le certificat d'\u00e9tudes.

C'est pourquoi, pensant que cela se fait peut-\u00eatre au Canada, je me suis ferm\u00e9e de tous-fiers, ma requ\u00eate.\n\nNous sommes tous deux catholiques, sans enfant, sans point de naissance, je suis form\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de mes \u00e9tudes ant\u00e9rieures et me ferme de vous assurer que j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9e dans dernier le P\u00e8re d'hommes de la ville de Marseille. Quant \u00e0 ma femme, ses deux ans d'enseignement ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 une exp\u00e9rience.\n\nAu cas o\u00f9 ma requ\u00eate nous int\u00e9resserait, je vous serais tr\u00e8s reconnaissante de me faire savoir assez rapidement, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que je puisse me d\u00e9terminer pour la prochaine ann\u00e9e de ma femme, ainsi que tous enseignements suffisants si ce fut effectif.\n\nDans cette attente, je vous fie de croire, honn\u00eate et sinc\u00e8rement, \u00e0 l'expression de mes sentiments sinc\u00e8res.

J'enseigne depuis 12 ans et je poss\u00e8de mon dipl\u00f4me d'Ecole Normale, Brevet Compl\u00e9mentaire.\n\nJe n'ai jamais eu de difficult\u00e9 avec les \u00e9l\u00e8ves au point de vue discipline et mes moyens pour stimuler le travail en classe et la bonne conduite sont reconnus comme tr\u00e8s recommandables par Messieurs les Inspecteurs d'Ecole.\n\nJ'aime beaucoup l'enseignement que je consid\u00e8re bien plus comme une vocation qu'une profession. Le fait d'enseigner \u00e0 des naturels du pays me sourirait tout particuli\u00e8rement.\n\nJ'ai pris de l'exp\u00e9rience dans toutes les ann\u00e9es du cours \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire et dans les 8e et 9e du cours compl\u00e9mentaire.\n\nActuellement, je pourrais avoir une classe du comt\u00e9 de Bellechasse au salaire de $2,800.00. Je crois que le salaire de $3,000.00 pour enseigner \u00e0 Manouan ne serait pas de trop, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les difficult\u00e9s de transport et les grandes d\u00e9penses qu'elles occasionnent.\n\nJe sais que plusieurs professeurs vous offriront des salaires plus bas, mais il arrive souvent qu'ils n'acceptent un engagement que pour une ann\u00e9e seulement et leur exp\u00e9rience est souvent limit\u00e9e \u00e0 quelques ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience. Pour ma part, je serais pr\u00eat \u00e0 signer un engagement de plusieurs ann\u00e9es et je vous donne l'assurance que vous n'auriez pas \u00e0 regretter mon engagement.\nSur demande, je pourrai vous fournir de tr\u00e8s bonnes r\u00e9f\u00e9rences. L'an dernier, j'ai d\u00fb prendre une classe dont le professeur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de quitter les \u00e9l\u00e8ves parce que ces Messieurs \u00e9taient rois et ma\u00eetres et je n'ai pas eu \u00e0 toucher un seul \u00e9l\u00e8ve et M. l'Inspecteur d'Ecole s'est dit enchant\u00e9 du bon travail scolaire et de la tr\u00e8s bonne discipline chez les \u00e9l\u00e8ves hier si brouillants et si dissip\u00e9s.\n\nDans l'attente d'une r\u00e9ponse favorable et prompte, je suis heureux de me dire votre bien oblig\u00e9 en attendant d'\u00eatre le plus d\u00e9vou\u00e9 de vos titulaires de classe.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDominique Hamelin, professeur,\n\nSt-Paul,\n(Montmagny).(2)\nP.Q.\n\nN.B.

It was impossible for me to call at the appointed time and I'm very sorry to have missed you.\n\nI expect that you wished to discuss my application for a teaching position at Moose Pot. I think it would be very interesting work, but since discussing it with my wife, we have decided to stay near Toronto during the first year of our married life. Today I had the future\nto be accepted by the Board of School Studies for Port Hope, Ontario, to teach.\n\nPerhaps, we could make arrangements for me to do some worthwhile work amongst the Indians during next summer. If you are interested in this, you may write to me after September 4th.\n\nTo Mr. J.

The Provincial Brother of the Congregation of St. Gabriel will certainly deliver to me a writing assuring me being able to read both French & English.\n\nYou will find enclosed here-in reference from the Rev.

Galbraith,\n76 Eglinton Avenue East,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Galbraith:\n\nYour telegram regarding an appointment at Moose Factory was delivered to my home last night. This reply is also written at home and so is the form of application which I enclose. With this letter comes a copy of the Indian School Bulletin for May which contains the latest revision of the regulations for the classification of school staff employed by the Department and the salary schedule. You should study these regulations before completing the application form. If you have no experience to count, you would get (I suppose) the initial salary for Teacher, Grade 3, ($1900) plus a degree bonus of $120. Total $2020 for the first year. A room is supplied at the school but the cost of board is paid either in cash or extra service.\n\nThey need another teacher at Moose Fort school, but the teacher appointed must be competent in primary grade work, Grades 1 and 2. College degrees are useful equipment if the holder does not feel that it is beneath his dignity to accept the most challenging sort of work - the task of giving these Indian (and white) children a proper start on their school course. If we can do that, some day there may be plenty of scope for teachers of high school subjects. For the time being we must place the emphasis on the beginning grades, and we need the most expert talent we can get.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.A.F.

The reason for this was that Manouan is an isolated spot with means of communication that are not regular which would make it very difficult for a married man with dependents. Moreover, the teacherage provided is not large enough to accommodate a family and an extra teacher.\n\nFor the above reasons we cannot consider your application for this school.

I would appreciate information on salary.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Mr.) F.P. Genest.\nDear Gentlemen!\n\nFriends have informed me that You are looking for teachers for the Indian reservation schools. I am very interested in such a position. As German Immigrant I arrived at the 7th of June 51. My profession is \"Diplom-Ingenieur\", that is the same as here \"mechanical engineer\". I have studied for 4 years Mathematic, Physics, Electrotechnic, Mechanic a.s.o. on the technical Universities in Berlin and Stuttgart, Germany. My examen for the degree I have made in 1943. My knowledge of the English language is pretty good, for I have learned it in school for 6 years and after the war I have been employed with the U.S.Military Government and U.S.High Commission for Germany for 5 years. Beside statistical and sociological work I have trained there many men for the public opinion research work.\n\nI am 34 years old, married, without children. My wife is with me and I think she too will find there a useful work. I have just made my first application for the intention to get the Canadian citizenship. I will not forget to mention, that I have good experiences in teaching, for I have worked in my sparetime as teacher for mathematic, physics and English. My father was teacher in Germany, but in 1937 he was forced to quit his job because he did not like to go into the N.S.D.A.P.\n\nNow I like to get full informations about salary, working and living conditions, the way to go there and the duration of the position I am available at every time. I add a character-reference of my last employer, but I kindly beg You to send it back if You do not have a possibility to give me a position, for it is my last copy.\n\nMy address is:\n157.Walmer Rd.\nToronto/ Ontario\nOFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR GERMANY\n\nREACTIONS ANALYSIS STAFF\n\nFrankfurt, Germany\n17 March 1951\n\nCHARACTER REFERENCE\n\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:\n\nMr. Siegfried Bock worked as interviewer with NSD-Opinion Surveys, later HICOG Reactions Analysis Staff, from 1946 to 1949.

She is a mature girl in her late 20's. Because she was an invalid in hospital from the age of 3 to 16, she missed schooling, but has since that time gone as far as Grade 9. She hasn't the Mathematics and Science necessary for a Nova Scotia license; but she has the personality, grace, and self composure that would make her an excellent pattern for young Indians to follow.\n\nMy recommendation is that she be appointed a Travelling Teacher to the Indian schools of Nova Scotia, teaching singing, speech habits, behavior, and dozens of things needed in society but not taught in ordinary schools. At least, they are not taught by example.\n\nAre you willing to ask your Nova Scotia representative to meet Miss Christmas and to consider what use he can make of her? She belongs to the Sydney Reserve. Her father was Chief at the time of her birth. At present she is head chamber maid at the Stanley Hotel, Truro. Several Truro citizens are now helping her with her education -- especially in speech. Last week, she addressed the Kiwanis Club, which was broadcast. She is giving a series of 13 broadcasts over CKCL, the local Truro Station.\n\nIt would be foolish to delay her usefulness by asking her to prepare herself for a regular teacher's license -- which requires subjects that not one Indian in 100 will want or need. A special license to teach what all need seems logical. I assure you, she is worth special consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nFast President of Canadian Federation of Home and School and Fast President Nova Scotia Home and School Federation.\nWOULD LIKE INDIAN SCHOOL ON MANITOULIN ISLAND OR OTHER INDIAN RESERVATION HOLD CLASS A LICENSE PROVINCE NOVA SCOTIA ONE YEAR TEACHING SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED WOULD APPRECIATE PROMPT REPLY BY TELEGRAM FURTHER INFORMATION IF REQUIRED.\n\nJOSEPH D MACDONELL BOX 396\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. Joseph D. MacDonell,\nBox 396,\nAntigonish, N.S.\n\nDear Mr. MacDonell:\n\nIn reply to your recent letter concerning enrollment in an Indian school, we are forwarding to you a standard application form which we would like you to complete and return.\n\nThe completion of this form obligates you in no way but gives us the necessary information to determine the classification and salary to which your qualifications and experience entitle you and provides the basis for further correspondence.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nChief, Superintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI have for acknowledgement your letter of August 3, with which was submitted a copy of a letter to your office from L.A. DeWolfe of Truro, N.S.\n\nUnless the letter said so specifically, from its contents and from a knowledge of both Mr. and Mrs. L.A. DeWolfe, I would presume that the letter was written by Mr. L.A. DeWolfe. I know Mr. L.A. DeWolfe slightly, having taken classes from him at the Nova Scotia Agricultural College. He is now past the active teaching age and is, I believe, retired for many years. He was connected, I believe, with the Nova Scotia Agricultural College and the Provincial Department of Education. He is well known, much travelled, fluent and capable, but I believe that his ideas were not always acceptable by either of the institutions he was connected with.\n\nWith reference to Miss Helen Christmas, about whom he wrote, she is a daughter of Ben B. Christmas of Sydney Indian Reservation. She is about 30 years of age. I know her only through several interviews and office records. Of late years, to my knowledge, she has been a reasonably good character, handicapped by a TB bone condition which affects both hands, her hip, and her ankle. In spite of these defects and slight resulting deformity, she is nevertheless doing her best to get by and our records indicate very little assistance being given her. Unfortunately, when a bit younger, she apparently committed a few indiscretions and as a result has an illegitimate child, Leona,\n\n(Continued)\nin the Shubenacadie Residential School and, according to our Doctor, B. C. Archibald, Medical Officer for this Agency, both he and Dr. A. W. Armiston treated her for syphilis. At her last test she still had a positive Kahn, although the Doctor assures me that her condition is non-infectious.\n\nWith reference to Mr. DeWolfe's recommendation that she be appointed as teacher in the Indian Affairs Service, I feel that I can not agree, particularly in view of the fact that her unfortunate experiences are well known to Indians of this and most other Agencies in Nova Scotia. If your office wishes, I could, on my next trip through Truro, interview Mr. DeWolfe and explain to him in confidence the nature of her background and its knowledge by the majority of the Indians with whom she would have to come in contact.\n\nF.B.

DeWolfe, Truro, N.S.\n\nFrom the information contained in your letter, it is evident that we have no position in any of our schools to which Miss Helen Christmas could be appointed.\n\nIn view of the contents of the last paragraph of your letter, I am advising Mr. DeWolfe that you will call on him and for your information I enclose a copy of this letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Superintendent of Education\nAugust 14th, 1951.\n\nMr. L.A.

From there I received a life certificate after completing a two-year course.\n\nLater I studied two years at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music at Oberlin, Ohio, and received a teacher's certificate in music from there.\nFollowing more years of teaching I returned to Western Michigan College for further study and in 1929 received the B.A. degree.\n\nAfter additional teaching experience and more study, I received the M.A. degree from the University of Michigan last February. Since then I have earned twenty hours of credits from the School of Librarianship at Western Michigan College.\n\nHaving had a number of years of experience in teaching on the Navajo Reservation, I would be interested in teaching Indian children in one of the provinces in Canada.

I should know it, because I have heard from time to time of your interest in the Indian work, especially in the field of Education.\n\nYou may have heard of my interest in the Indian people from my past experience as Missionary and Teacher at Christian Island, Ont., and as Int. Teacher and Assistant Book Supervisor at the Indian Residential School, Wunacy, Ont.\n\nI had 7 years teaching experience in Indian Schools, and I enjoyed it very well. I still maintain my interest in the Indian people. Each year I go back to Christian Island 3 or 4 times for some activity. I also keep in touch with Rev. Goblin and his project at Wunacy. I am much interested in his activities, and he surely deserves a good deal of credit.\n\nSince coming to Midland I have had experience in Supervisory Class work, and in the past few years I have been Director of\nI auxiliary classes for our 3 public schools.\nI have also been director of sports for the\n3 schools.\n\nI have always hoped that some day I\nwould be able to return to the Indian work.\nMy experience and special courses since\nleaving Christian Island would surely stand\nme in good stead for the need in Indian\nschools. My special hope was always,\nthat I would be able to fit in with Mr.\nJollins' project. I have always wanted to\nwork with Mr. Jollins. Perhaps that may\neven yet be possible.\n\nI left Christian Island mainly for\n2 reasons\u2014First, to gain special\nexperience, and second, for my young family's\nsake. I have 2 children, now in grades\n2 and 6. Naturally, if and when I am\nable to return to Indian work, I shall have\nto consider my family's proximity to school\naccommodation.\n\nThis letter is really to let you\nknow of my continued interest in the Indian\nwork, and to say that I would appreciate\nknowing if positions available within the\nnext year. Perhaps we could avail ourselves\nof one of the opportunities. I would also\nappreciate knowing what the present salary\nschedule is, and what the superannuation\nset-up is.\nI now have the following qualifications with 15 years teaching experience\u20147 yrs. in Indian Schools, and 8 yrs. in Midland Public Schools.\n\nPermanent First Class Teaching Certificate\nPermanent Auxiliary Education Certificate\nVocational Guidance Certificate\nSt. John's Ambulance First Aid\nStrathcona Physical Training Certificate\nand a Course in Indian Archaeology with the University of Western Ontario in the Midland Area.\n\nI trust that I may hear from you at your convenience regarding any information which you feel would be of interest.\n\nThank you.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nKen Cowan\nCentral School, Midland, Ont.\nResidence - 112, 6th St., Midland, Ont.\nCC.

There are approximately twelve families in this group, who have resided at this point for many years. They have always operated on a co-operative basis and at the present time are requesting schooling facilities for the fifteen children of their group.\n\nWith regard to a request for a school of this group of Indians, I wish to advise that in the 1951-52 estimates an allotment was requested for the purpose of erecting a school at this point, and a further recommendation in this regard was forwarded by our Regional Supervisor, Mr. G.H. Gooderham, to the Superintendent of Education, in letter File: 142/16-3 dated September 18, 1950. We are also in receipt of copy of correspondence addressed to the Northern Administration, Dept. of Resources and Development, File 4235-9-3 dated December 22, 1950, wherein it is stated that this matter should be discussed at a meeting of the sub-committee on education of the Northwest Territories Council. To date we have had no further word on this matter.\nAt the present time we have an excellent opportunity of obtaining the services of Miss Teresa Carterette, a student of anthropology at the University of Chicago. Miss Carterette came to this country for the purpose of studying our local Indians. She has studied social education and is presently writing a thesis for her master's degree in anthropology. She is a United States citizen and it would appear that she is well fitted for the teaching duties that would be required at this point.\n\nThe Indians of Marie River group are making all arrangements for this year at least, to supply housing facilities and schoolroom space for the starting of the school for their children. As can be seen, we would receive at least one year's schooling for the children of this group with very little cost to the Department other than the salary of Miss Carterette. As she is a citizen of the United States it is best that that salary therefore would have to be paid on a monthly basis. As she would be assuming all welfare duties of this group, I would suggest that a salary of $200.00 per month, without Northern Allowance, be allowed.\n\nAs stated previously, there are fifteen children in this group of school age and we have been assured that the daily attendance for the school year would be at least twelve. The Marie River group of Indians are industrious and are attempting to be very self reliant. We cannot stress too strongly our recommendation in starting a school at this point by obtaining the services of Miss Carterette as schoolteacher.\n\nWe realize that due to the lateness of the season it is impossible to obtain the necessary textbooks etc., for the starting of this school, from Ottawa, however if the Department concur in the hiring of Miss Carterette as teacher, we will attempt to obtain textbooks and other necessary supplies from the surplus on hand at our other Indian Day Schools throughout the Agency.\n\nAs the Marie River group of Indians are predominantly of the Catholic Religion the Indian Act requires that the teacher be also of this faith, and as Miss Carterette is of the Catholic Religion, we consider that this point would be covered.\n\nIn Fort Simpson there is a Roman Catholic Indian Day School, but it will be realized that the transportation of this country would not allow these children from the Marie River Group to attend this school. It is noted in your Army message that a letter is to follow from your office in this regard. Should you request information that we have not already supplied, we will supply it at the first opportunity.

I may add that no funds are available in this year's appropriation for the establishment of a school at that point.\n\nIn the circumstances it is regretted that it is not possible to employ Miss Carterette as a teacher at Marie River.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nMr. G.H. Marcoux,\nRegional Inspector of\nIndian Schools,\n537 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.,\n\nReference your 217/2-32\nof September 6th\n\nWe have checked your list of\nvacancies and note that you have listed the\nCross Lake U.C. School. Our records show\nthat we have two teachers employed at this\nschool namely Mrs. M. Biensch and Mrs. A.\nKlassen. Please confirm the fact that there\nis no vacancy at this school.\n\nWe have now appointed Miss G.\nBenfield to the Island Lake U.C. Indian Day School.\n\nWe do have a vacancy at the Cross Lake\nR.C. Indian Day School. It was understood that Miss\nR. Paupanekis was accepting this school, but as no\ndocuments have been received her name has not been\nadded to the salary list. Would you please let us\nknow whether or not Miss Paupanekis reported for duty.\n\nAt the Sandy Bay Indian Day School it\nhas not been possible to appoint Mr. Connelly as\ndocuments have not been completed and returned. For\nthe same reason Sister L'Heureux has not been appointed\nto the Berens River R.C. Indian Day School.\nWhen we have received the necessary documents completed by Mr. W. Matuschynie, his name will be added to our list as teacher at the York Factory Combined School.\n\nPerhaps the Church authorities concerned could assist you in finding suitable applicants for the vacancies in Manitoba Indian Day Schools. Do you consider that inserting advertisements in local newspapers would be of any assistance to you in securing qualified teachers?\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe your letter of August 29th, 1951, your file No. Jeffery St. G.

Dr. Best has advised me that Mrs. Klassen is not returning to the Cross Lake U.C. School. Therefore, there will be a vacancy at this school.\n\nRegarding Miss Faupanekis - she has been appointed to the Cross Lake R.C. Indian Day School and has commenced her duties. The documents have been forwarded to her and will be forwarded to Ottawa on receipt of same.\n\nMr. Connelly's documents should be received shortly.\n\nThe name Mr. W. Matuschynee mentioned in the second last paragraph is not known to me.\n\nRegarding inserting advertisements in local newspapers. This has been done by Dr. Best but should be done again.\n\nG. H. Marcoux,\nRegional Inspector of Indian Schools for Manitoba.\nDear Miss Moore:\n\nI find we need the following teachers:\n\n**HOLAND** - R. C. On C. N. R., just out of Nakina. Good cottage.

Good salaries with furnished and heated living quarters. Pension fund. For details and application forms apply to Mr. E.H. Conrad, Regional Inspector of Indian Schools, 304 Post Office Building, Regina, Sask.\"\n\nOur list of present vacancies in Saskatchewan includes Shoal Lake and Sturgeon Lake. It is noted that you have listed Shoal Lake but omitted Sturgeon Lake. Is there a reason for this omission?\n\nOur files for the Jubilee, Springside and Cohoesence Indian Day Schools state that these three new schools are to accommodate the pupils who formerly attended Round Lake Indian Residential School. (This was a United Church School)\n\nWe have no file for the Mistawasis No. 2 Indian Day School and presume that this will be second classroom of the present Mistawasis School whose teacher is Mr. J.A. Bell.\n\nYou have listed the James Smith South School. Our records show that Mrs. H.M. Rolph is the teacher at this school. Is it intended to add a second classroom?\nYou will, no doubt, have received a copy of official salary letter sent to Mr. F.J. Daniels dated October 2, 1951, advising him that he had been appointed as substitute teacher during the absence of Mr. Lowe. It is presumed that Mr. Lowe will be able to return to the Red Earth Indian Day School on January 1, 1952. Would you please submit a report upon Mr. Lowe's condition sometime during the month of December indicating his probable date of return to duty.\n\n[Signature]\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nOctober 18, 1951\n\nMy dear Miss Maille:\n\nAs requested by you in our telephone conversation, I am sending with this letter two blank forms of application. Only one completed copy is required at this office.\n\nIn the accompanying copy of the Indian School Bulletin you will find an account of our salary schedule and related regulations.\n\nThere are not many Indian schools where French is used as the language of instruction, and at present there are no vacancies in such schools. There is always, however, a need for teachers for Roman Catholic Indian schools where the children speak and are taught in the English language.\n\nI should add that the salary is the same wherever you choose to teach, but, as teachers pay their own travelling expenses, distance is a consideration.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nC.A.T.

Rev.\nMartin to recommend that Mr. Ronald Steininger be transferred from\nLittle Red River Indian Day School to Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School,\nand that Mr. M. Hubert Riggs, teacher, James Smith North School be\ntransferred to Little Red River School. This would, of course,\ncreate a vacancy at James Smith South Indian School. But the\npresent building at Sturgeon Lake is not fit for occupancy, and the\nnew building is in the process of construction.\n\nThe opening of a second classroom at Mistawasis Reserve has\nbeen recommended by Mr. N. J. McLeod, Indian Superintendent, Duck\nLake Agency. Please refer to your letter, File # 109/6-1-616(E),\ndated October 4, 1951.\n\nThere was a vacancy listed for the James Smith South Indian\nSchool, inasmuch as in my report on my inspection of this school and\non the work of the teacher forwarded to you, (reference my letter,\nFile No. 3554-109/2-32-609, dated October 9, 1951), it was recommended\nthat the Mrs. Rolph's services with the Indian Affairs Branch be\nterminated not later than Dec. 31, 1951. Mrs. Rolph is not physically\nor mentally capable of continuing as teacher of any school.

Our salaries are quite attractive, but before we could give you any definite information, we should like to have some detail concerning your professional training. We should like to know how much High School education you had before entering Normal, and whether your Normal school training was apart entirely from the academic work. We should like also to know the duration of your Normal school training. It is not absolutely necessary to have an Ontario Certificate to teach in our schools, but it is the practice for us to give preference to teachers who have Ontario licenses.\n\nPlease address your reply to me at Markham, Ontario.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.

He gave me your address, that I might contact you for the desired information.\n\nI have a First Class teaching certificate for the Province of Quebec, and expect to attend Normal School next summer to secure a teaching certificate for Ontario.\n\nI have ten years teaching experience in Quebec, and this term will give me six years in Ontario. I also served eighteen months in the Canadian Army (active). I am thirty-eight years of age.\n\nWould you please let me know what salary I could draw in one of the schools for Indian children. If I worked during the summer months as Welfare Officer, would I be paid at the same rate? Are holidays given with pay?\n\nI am interested in the Indian language; is there a dictionary printed in Indian-English, if so, where could I secure one?\n\nI am at present engaged as teacher, so could not accept a position until another school term begins. Is it necessary to have an Ontario certificate to teach in the schools for Indians, or would my Quebec certificate serve equally as well?\n\nA reply would be appreciated at your convenience.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nMurray M. Kelso\nDear Sirs:\n\nPlease let me know if you are likely to have openings for teachers in the Indian Day Schools of Ontario. I would like to teach in one next year.\n\nI have thirteen years' experience in Ontario and two in the Province of Alberta. The former includes three years at the Indian Residential School at Spanish, Ontario. I resigned because of family responsibilities.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Indian Education\nDept. of Citizenship and Immigration\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nIn our correspondence of July of last year, concerning Mr. Clarence J. Bernard's and my application for positions in the Indian schools, you were extremely kind; and to support your confidence, I should like to tell you of a new development since that time\u2014one of which you, in charge of educational work, might at least wish to know.\n\nHarrison Shorthand (first Copyrighted in the Dominion) is becoming academically known throughout all Canada. It is the subject, as you have probably already noticed, of a series of 15 articles currently appearing in the Canadian High News (which has the largest circulation of any high-school paper in the language). There were 2,100 new subscribers (more than 6,000 new readers) last week in Winnipeg alone.\n\nThe present articles have to do with \"Shorthand for Personal Note-taking\"; but you will be interested to know these are presently to appear in the form of a manual, too. You may wish to know, also, that the use of the system is not confined to personal note-taking; rather, it is also available for complete secretarial and reporting training.\n\nThe inclosed bulletin will give the background, nature, and claims of Harrison Shorthand; and if you would like further information on the system, at any time, it would always be a pleasure to send it to you.\n\nI have another reason for writing to you, Mr. Neary: Should suitable opportunity arise, I hope to be in Canada. I am a Canadian; but my associate in this work, Mr. Bernard, is not Canadian. He wishes to become one, on taking up residence in Canada; but should there be any difficulty, at any time, our case would be facilitated by the fact that someone in the Department of Citizenship and Immigration has, thus early in the matter, been at least familiar with his name. I shall therefore be grateful for your keeping this correspondence in your files. Thank you.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nCharles H. Harrison, Ph.D.\nTo Educators:\n\nThe following is a copy of a letter just sent to a prominent Educator:\n\nDear Mr. -- :\n\nIn answer to your request for further information concerning Harrison Shorthand, it is a pleasure to submit these data for your consideration:\n\nBackground of Harrison Shorthand\n\nTwenty years were spent in the conscientious teaching of the principal systems of shorthand on all levels (including that in which you are most interested). This included one entire year, in teachers' college, in specific research into the relative merits of five of the prevailing systems. Three of these were taught in regular class work, side by side but in separate classes; two were taught in research groups organized for that special purpose. All relevant conditions were rigidly controlled as far as circumstances would then (and probably ever would) permit.\n\nThe results of this research (the report on which brought outstanding commendation from the Government) were all, when favorable, incorporated into the construction of Harrison Shorthand; an equally serious effort was made to avoid all weaknesses that had been shown.\n\nNature of Harrison Shorthand\n\nOnly three points need be considered in the objective evaluation of any shorthand system; that is, its ease of learning, its essential speed, and its essential legibility.\n\n\"Ease of learning\" must not be at the expense of sacrificing the acquisition of an adequate and thoroughly-mastered vocabulary. The ease of learning of Harrison Shorthand is not achieved in this way; rather, it rests upon (1) the comparative simplicity of its theory, (2) the ready availability of longhand transcripts (side by side with all shorthand material), and (3) the fact that the text is not merely the presentation of a system, but that it is also a course of study, with specific directions to the student and teacher as to what is to be done (and not to be done) every step of the way. It is sufficiently easy to learn, in fact, that several of our best students were formerly subnormal in a prevailing system.\n\n\"Essential speed\" does not lie in the ultimate unlearning of thousands of elementary forms and the learning of countless thousands of others of essentially arbitrary nature. The speed of Harrison Shorthand is inherent in the nature of the system itself and rests upon (1) the comparative brevity of its forms from the very beginning, and (2) the dominance of straight lines and mere ticks.\n\n\"Essential legibility\" does not rest upon undue emphasis of either context or the writer's memory of the material he has recorded. The legibility of Harrison Shorthand is, again, inherent in the system itself and rests upon:\n1. The contrasting length of its strokes\n   A size-ratio of 1-to-2 (rather than the prevailing ratio of only 1-to-2); thus allowing for some measure of distortion, in high-speed writing, without necessary loss of legibility at this point.\n\n2. The origin of its strokes\n   These are not based upon the \"scrawling fluency\" of longhand, with its comparative illegibility; rather, upon the definiteness of the straight line, circle, and angle (always accompanied by the speed which comes from its brevity and dominance of straight lines).\n\n3. The contrasting slant of its strokes\n   The contrast of four (not merely two) distinctive slants.\n\n4. The sharpness and angularity of its forms\n   Not based upon the comparative uncertainty of curvilinear forms; rather, upon the sharpness of straight lines, ticks, and angles.\n\nClaims of Harrison Shorthand\n\n1. It is claimed that, assuming equal teacher-ability and student-aptitude and equal periods of time for class and preparation, Harrison Shorthand will produce \"at least the usual results in one-half the usual time\"--and all experience thus far has substantiated the accuracy of that claim;\n\n2. High-school students of average aptitude, studying under teachers of average ability, should have no difficulty in passing five-minute tests on standard material (1.4 syllable intensity) at 100 words a minute at the end of the first year;\n\n3. Business-school students, under similar conditions of aptitude, reach 100 words a minute, on the same material, in approximately three months;\n\n4. Some students will do better still, as will be evident from the following results, secured in six weeks and entirely with beginners, in the First Summer School for Teachers of Harrison Shorthand which closed recently in this city:\n\n   a. All completed the theory in three weeks;\n   b. All except three passed, at the end of six weeks, five-minute tests at 80 words a minute or higher (the three exceptions were writing 75 words a minute on the same material);\n   c. Three passed (two of them without an error), at the end of six weeks, the Regents examination for the completion of second-year shorthand.\nDecember 3rd, 1951.\n\nCharles H. Harrison, Esq., Ph.D.,\n144 West 70 Street,\nNew York 23,\nN.Y.\nU.S.A.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have received your letter of November 8th, 1951.\n\nWe suggest that you contact the Citizenship Branch of this Department in connection with the matter mentioned in your letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\nHigh River, Alberta.\nNovember 17, 1951\n\nThe Minister,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nLegislative Bldg.,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI understand that from time to time there is an urgent need for teachers on Indian Reservations. I am a Baptist Minister working with the Baptist Union of Western Canada at the present time but have a burden for the Indian people concerning their physical and spiritual needs. Could you tell me what standard of training is necessary, amount of College and Normal etc.? What is the usual allowance for full-time teachers who are also qualified Ministers? I reside at the present time in the Province of Alberta but would be willing to work in any province, though I would prefer Alberta or British Columbia.\n\nI am writing this letter to your Department but am not sure if you deal with each of the provinces yourself or have an adjutant in each area.\n\nIf you are not prepared to furnish the above information, would you kindly direct me to the proper source?\n\nWishing you every success in your work,\n\nSincerely,\n\nRev. James F. Talbot,\nBox 307\nHigh River, Alberta.\n\nFor Attention\nDecember 3rd, 1951.\n\nReverend James F. Talbot,\nBox 307,\nHigh River,\nALBERTA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Education Division of the Indian Affairs Branch employs teachers for Indian Day Schools throughout Canada. We require that teachers hold Certificates granted by provincial Departments of Education, and determine the classification and salary of a teacher according to the type of teaching certificate held.\n\nA teacher who holds a First Class Certificate granted by a provincial Department of Education would be classified as a School Teacher Grade Three at a salary of $1900.00 an academic year.\n\nIf you wish to contact our Field official, you may write to Mr. L.G.P.Weller, Regional Inspector of Indian Schools, 620 Public Building, Calgary, Alberta.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Thelan\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nAM:GFB\nDr. P.E.

I said I would write you about this. There is a lady in this city who is a graduate of McMaster University and who has had some teaching experience. She was a missionary in India but I gather is not going back. She would like a position such as the one that Miss Fraser occupies in Brandon.\n\nCan you tell me whether there is an opening at The Pas, the salary which would be paid, and how this lady should make application? From all I can gather, you would be very fortunate in getting a person of this type.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MLT\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10), Volume 6005, File 1-1-X, part 16) School Files\nOttawa, Ontario  \nDecember 14, 1951\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have your letter regarding teachers at Brandon and The Pas.\n\nThe teachers in these sanatoria, like teachers in our hospitals elsewhere, are appointed by the Education Service of Indian Affairs Branch so I am forwarding your letter to Mr. Phelan and asking him to reply to your letter direct.\n\nI note from your letter of December 11 that you expect to be in Ottawa after Christmas.

For such positions the Department prefers to engage applicants who have had special training and successful experience in the earlier schools. Experience in introducing children to the use of the English language is another valuable qualification, and this the lady whom you mention may possess. She should complete and return two copies of the attached form of application for employment, together with a letter describing further any special qualifications for the type of employment she desires.\n\nAs you probably know the sanatorium nearest The Pas is at Clearwater, about thirty miles by road from the town.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nBy CAFC/Clark\n\nCC to Dr. P.E.

You were staying at that time to interest me in teaching at some of the Indian Outposts in Northern Ontario. I understand that the Catholic Welfare Bureau in Toronto were anxious to secure Catholic teachers who would be interested in working at some of these outposts.\n\nIn this year's graduating class, there are three or four female graduates (including myself) who are interested in securing information about the teaching prospects in certain of these outposts.\n\nWhat qualifications would be necessary for the teaching positions in these Ontario Indian outposts? All of us will have B.A. degrees next May, and some of us have several years teaching experience in Prince Edward Island. Would it be necessary to have any normal training in Ontario? Would we be employed by the Ontario Department of Education or the Catholic Welfare Bureau?\n\nI'd also appreciate information on the salaries paid for teaching at the Reservations. What are the physical conditions for teaching like? Most of these outposts are isolated\u2014this would probably entitle teachers to isolation pay. Is there still a scarcity of teachers in Ontario?\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note: Poor copy]\nSAINT DUNSTAN'S COLLEGE\nCHARLOTTETOWN\nPRINCE EDWARD ISLAND\n\nWe should appreciate it very much if you could supply us with all information relevant to potential teaching employment in Ontario and advice as to regards the steps to be followed towards achieving employment.\n\nThank you, further, for your help.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPeter Beaton,\nSt Dunstan's College,\nCharlottetown, P.E.I.\nFebruary 16th, 1952.\n\nMr. Peter Beaton,\nSt. Dunstan's College,\nCharlottetown,\nPrince Edward Island.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nYour letter addressed to Father Sweeney of the Catholic Welfare Bureau, Toronto, has been referred to us.\n\nThe Department is interested in obtaining applications from applicants who hold a regular teaching certificate granted by a provincial Department of Education. We are, therefore, attaching application forms which you may have completed by any of your friends who are qualified teachers and might be interested in teaching in an Indian Day School. The salary of a teacher is determined by the type of certificate held and the years of experience. A bonus of $120.00 is allowed to teachers who hold a B.A. degree.\n\nThe Department does not pay transportation expenses of teachers but most of our schools have an attached teacherage with house, fuel and light provided free.

We usually have vacancies requiring the services of Roman Catholic teachers.\n\nIn addition to our regular Day schools which are operated from September to June, we have seasonal schools which are operated for a few months during the summer. For these positions it is not necessary to hold a teaching certificate as the employment is of a temporary nature only. However, we do give preference to certificated teachers when they are available for duty.\nWe presume from your letter, however, that you are mainly interested in teaching during the full academic year.\n\nWe shall be pleased to hear from you at your convenience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nAM:GFB\nDear Mr. Philan:\n\nI received your letter of January 10th inst., and wish to thank you for your reply and application form.\n\nBefore making a formal application for a position, I should appreciate knowing more details of Indian School work.

At present it would seem that appointments will need to be made for the following schools:\n\n1. Horse Lake School, now nearing completion. Catholic teacher required.\n2. Fond du Lac School. To replace Mr. Thompson who has signified his intention to leave this school in June. Catholic teacher required.\n3. Standoff School. If constructed in 1952 this school will need two Catholic teachers.\n4. Sunchild Cree School. To replace old Mr. Toews who wishes to retire this year. A Protestant teacher needed.\n5. Fort McKay. To replace Miss R. Gimbal who is an unqualified teacher. A Catholic teacher required.\n6. Stony Plain No. 1 School. To replace Mr. Filewich who is an unqualified teacher, appointed to fill in until the end of the year. A Catholic teacher needed.\n\nI should like to have Alberta trained teachers for these posts if possible.\n\nNewly qualified teachers can sometimes be engaged for the forthcoming school year during the month of April when they have completed their university year.\n\nMay we have your permission to offer these positions to any suitable candidates that may apply?\n\nL.

Keeping in mind the date upon which these schools will be completed, you may proceed to find teachers for them.\n\nAs Mr. Toews is retiring, a teacher should be found for the Samsild Indian Day School. We have written to you concerning the submission of Mr. Toews' resignation. We would also like to know what specific Sect the majority of Indians attending the Samsild Indian Day School belong.\n\nWe have received the resignation of Miss Regimbald and have approved the temporary appointment of Mrs. Faichney until the end of June, 1952. As an R.C. teacher will definitely be required for this school for the 1952-1953 academic year, you may take immediate steps in finding a replacement for Miss Regimbald. If you are able to find a certificated and experienced teacher for the Stony Plain No. I Indian Day School, we shall be pleased to hear from you so that we may send one month's notice of termination of duties to Mr. Filewych. We have written a separate letter to you regarding this teacher.\n\nWe realize that you would prefer to have Alberta trained teachers for these positions if possible and hope that you will be successful in engaging teachers who will soon be completing their University year.\nAs the names of teachers are retained on the salary list until specific advice to remove their names is given, we would appreciate it if you would contact all the teachers in your region and ascertain which teachers wish to submit their resignations at the end of June, 1952. Teachers who do not wish to be reengaged for the 1952-1953 academic year should submit their resignations in the near future so that their names may be removed from the salary list and the positions listed as vacancies.\n\nThere may be teachers whom you think should be notified that their services will no longer be required after June 30, 1952. If so, please submit an individual report on these teachers giving your reasons for recommending that their services be terminated. It will then be possible for us to give these teachers one month's notice in writing of dismissal.\n\nWe shall presume that all teachers not reported upon are willing to remain in our teaching employ and that their services are satisfactory. The names of these teachers will, therefore, remain on the salary list for the following academic year.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\n22116\n\n1952 MAR 8 AM 11:02\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Bldgs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI understand there are a number of Indian Residential Schools that require teachers for the coming term, September 1952.

We would, therefore, like to know if there are any teachers within your district whose services should be terminated. There may be teachers who are inefficient or who are past retirement age. Whenever possible it is recommended that teachers who do not hold teaching certificates be replaced by certificated and experienced teachers.\nLast year we advertised for teachers in the Edmonton Journal. We would like to have your recommendations regarding the need for advertising, the paper in which advertisement should be inserted, the content of the advertisement, the number of insertions and the dates of issue.

Teacher, Millbrook Indian Day School\n\n(1) Audrey Chisholm, 19 years of age, who has Grade 12 with Superior First Class License from the Nova Scotia Department of Education. She is from Port Hawkesbury, Inverness Co., and is teaching in Point Tupper, Richmond Co.. She has one year experience. I understand from reliable sources that this is an excellent teacher, full of character, reliability and integrity. I do believe, however, that Truro with Grades 1 to 6, an enrolment of at least 40, and where considerable community work should be done, would conceivably be too difficult for one of her years and experience.\n\n(Sgd.)

Teacher, Millbrook Indian Day School\n\n(3) Colin MacLennan, approximately 30 years old, from Port Hood, Inverness Co., N.S., and presently teaching at Fort Hood Island, which school has an enrolment of seven pupils.\n\nAt the time of the competition held to provide a Grade 3 Clerk at this Agency, held in November of 1951, this man applied. The Board did not react too well in his case and felt that he should continue with his teaching. If I recall correctly, he is a Veteran; He has Grade 12 and two years at St. F.X. University and holds a Superior First Class License, obtained from the Nova Scotia Department of Education. I was interested in him and went to considerable trouble investigating his background. He was just an average student at the University; I understand from Acting Inspector G. Lent, that while teaching in Antigonish Co., he was not recommended for his annual increment, by the Inspector in that county. Mr. Lent, Acting Inspector of Schools for Inverness Co., states that at Glendale, a miscellaneous school with Grades 1 to 10 and an enrolment of 35, Mr. MacLennan did not do well. Confidentially, one of the clergy of the Diocese told me that Mr. MacLennan partakes often and possibly unwisely of intoxicants. This I cannot state definitely but could investigate if need be. I understand he's about to marry, which in all probability, would have a deterring effect on his consumption of alcohol. You might refer to the first attached.\n\n(Sgd) F.B.

From the advertisements which appeared in the\npapers last October, a number of applications were re-\nceived from qualified teachers who wish to enter our\nteaching service in September, 1952.\n\nShould the need to advertise for teachers in\nthis region arise, the Saskatchewan Star-Phoenix, the Regina\nLeader Post, the Western Producer, and the Saskatchewan\nFarmer, give sufficient coverage.

This information will be relayed to you as soon as possible.\n\nAlthough I am in personal contact with the teacher supply sources in Alberta, I believe some advertising is necessary. Our province is well covered by the Calgary Herald and the Edmonton Journal. An advertisement such as you suggest in your letter inserted in these two papers on May 29-31 would catch the attention of new teachers coming out of Normal School or universities as well as others who contemplate a change of school. A similar advertisement in the June 26-28 and the July 24-26 issues should be sufficient. The extent of our advertising would, of course, be governed by our initial success.\n\nL.G. P.

I have taught in East York Collegiate Institute for twenty-one years but am now required to retire on account of my age.

Leary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is about two years since I have had any correspondence with you. During those two years I have been continuing my studies at the University here. At the end of this term I shall have completed all the required classes for a B.A. - but one; and all but two classes of my Bachelor of Education. These I expect to finish by summer school and correspondence during the next two years. The completion of these two degrees will entitle me to an Advanced Certificate in Saskatchewan which is the highest teaching certificate that is given in Saskatchewan.\n\nHave you any Indian schools in which substitutes may be needed during May and June? (in the Prairie Provinces). And what opportunities are there in the Indian Affairs Educational Branch for the future - in some field in\nconnection with educational work?\n\nYou have my application form on file, Mr. Nearly, and with what I have told you in this letter I should be very glad if you would write and state what salary I would get for teaching in Indian Day or Residence Schools; and also let me know if there are any other opportunities in your Branch.\n\nI shall appreciate any information you may be able to give me!\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Mrs) Mary L. McGarry.\nBROTHERS OF HOLY CROSS\n2000 FLATBUSH AVENUE\nBROOKLYN N.Y.\nApril 9th\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ontario\nCanada\n\nDear Mr. Neary;\n\nIf your files are old enough, you can dig into them and find the letter which I mailed to your department on or about the date quoted in your file number.\n\nFrom the sound of your name, you might be one from \"down east\" perhaps even from St. F.X. University so I think I can write you on a more personal basis. I'm still seeking information on the Indian schools; so perhaps you will take a few minutes away from more important business and answer my questions.\n\nIn your letter you said that the church hires teachers for residential schools. Are such teachers paid by your department at the same rate as day school teachers or are they paid by the order which runs the school? Concerning the day schools; I suppose they are in the wilderness and that the teacher boards at one of the local resident's house.\n\nJust what is a first class certificate? In my present position, I am teaching at a parochial school since September 1949 but to my knowledge, I have no certificate. Now supposing I were to apply for a teaching position in Canada but could not produce a certificate although I could give proof of having taught, what chance would I stand to receive an appointment. Of course, it is understood that I would be applying as a layman. As far as academic standing is concerned, between my Canadian and American credits (a complete mixup incidentally), I have roughly three years of college. My credits come from St. Mary's College in Halifax, Notre Dame U. in Indiana and St. John's Teachers here in Brooklyn and with that I have a term of Canadian Army life in the war plus peace time militia. So, would all that help me to get an appointment until such time as I might get a Provincial license in Canada? So, in which bracket? Your salary schedule says \"a teaching month\" about how many months a year does that include. Do you hire from year to year or on a more permanent basis. And one final question, when are your appointments made and how soon ahead must one apply?\n\nI think I've covered all and I trust that this letter will be kept on a personal rather than a \"business\" level.\n\nP.S. Does the school in Nova Scotia have a male teacher for the older boys?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBrother Gerald R Sullivan, C.S.C.\nJanuary 26, 1951.\n\nRev. Brother Gerald R. Sullivan, C.S.C.,\nBrothers of Holy Cross,\n2000 Flatbush Avenue,\nBrooklyn, N.Y., U.S.A.\n\nDear Brother Sullivan:\n\nI have for answer your letter of January 19\nand can answer your questions as follows:\n\n(1) We expect our teachers to hold teaching certificates\ngranted by provincial Departments of Education. We do make\nsome exceptions with regard to certificates granted by states\nof the U.S.A.\n\n(2) The salaries vary with the type of certificate held.\nWe also offer free teacherages in most cases. We place\nCatholic teachers in Catholic schools. In the case of\nresidential schools, these teachers are hired by the Church,\nin the case of day schools, by the Department.\n\n(3) Our schools are scattered right across Canada but\nthe main vacancies for Catholic teachers occur in the Prairie\nProvinces and in British Columbia. We have little or no\ndifficulty in hiring Catholic teachers in Ontario, Quebec\nand the Maritime Provinces.\n\nA teacher with a First Class Certificate and 5 years\nof experience would start at $225.00 a teaching month. This salary\nwill likely be higher by September next as our schedule is being\nrevised.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nEducation Department\nThe Indian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Canada\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI am writing for any information you can send me on the teachers in the Indian schools in Canada. What qualifications do you demand of prospective teachers in your Indian schools? What salaries do you pay? Do you place Catholic teachers in Catholic schools or are they controlled by the Church? Into what sections of the country might a teacher be sent, may he choose his own school?\n\nAny other information you may have, I would appreciate very much.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBrother Gerald R Sullivan, C.S.C.\nApril 15, 1952.\n\nRev. Brother Gerald R. Sullivan, CS.C.,\nBrothers of Holy Cross,\n2000 Flatbush Ave.,\nBrooklyn 34, N.Y.,\n\nDear Brother Sullivan:\n\nSince you last wrote to the Department Mr. Bernard F. Neary has left the Education Division and Mr. Phillip Phelan is the Superintendent of Education.\n\nWould you please complete and return the attached application for employment form in order that we may assess your qualifications and experience in order to determine the classification and salary to which you will be entitled on our salary schedule.\n\nYou ask \"What is a First Class Certificate\". To be considered as having the equivalent of a First Class Certificate, an applicant must have Senior matriculation (or First Year University) plus one year of training in a regular teacher training institution. It is hoped that you hold a teaching certificate. Applicants who do not hold a teaching certificate are classified as Grade 1 teachers. For this classification the salary range is $1200 - $1800 an academic year. The salary range for teachers holding a First Class Certificate is from $1900 - $3700. Our academic year is for ten months from September to June.\n\nWe do not know to what Nova Scotia school you refer in your postscript.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.F. Davey,\nAssistant Superintendent of Education.\nKilowatha, Ont., April 7th\n\nTo:\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nAs I hear there may be a vacancy in the Indian School at Butelet Pt or Penman Pt (Cumberland House) Sask. may I ask a few questions?\n\nI have already taught the Indians at Birch River Portage (Cumberland House) and I wonder if it would be worth while to go back again. What salary do they pay now?\n\nAnd would my pay be paid?\n\nI am getting $21.00 when I am but as I am minority spirited I would love to work if it would be worth while. Of course I am 60 yrs. but have had good health.\n\nKindly let me know what opportunity there would be and the terms which I would have to abide by. I have a First Class Certificate.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMrs. A.M. McIntrye\nApril 17, 1952.\n\nMrs. A.M.

Phelan, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nCopeland Building,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nIn reply to your letter of March 31st, concerning the under-noted teachers, it is possible we shall have vacancies in Ontario, although I know of none at present in which a male Roman Catholic teacher is required.\n\nI remember one girl from St. Francis Xavier, Antigonish, who was one of the best teachers I ever saw. She had however taken her teacher training in the Provincial Normal School. We got one teacher from St. Francis last summer and he has not shown up so well. May I say that he took the Education Course at St. Francis. The trouble with the teacher training at Antigonish is the fact that it is likely to be more for High School work than Elementary School work. Then too, if you know the Province or the village, you will realise that the opportunity for practice teaching is extremely limited at this University. The last time I was there I believe the school in the village had four rooms. If St. Francis Xavier students took their training at Truro, they would have a great deal more practice teaching.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.G. Mingay,\nInspector of Schools.\n\nRe: Mr. J.A.

In view of your statement that Bishop Greenwood had arrived in the Yukon only two days previous to your letter, we did not reply immediately. However, it is felt that now a sufficient time has elapsed and that you should contact him requesting nominations of qualified teachers for these two vacancies.\n\nFor your convenience we are attaching a number of application forms and two complete sets of documents for completion by teachers selected.\n\nAs there is an acute shortage of qualified teachers, it is imperative that these vacancies be filled as soon as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Residential School,\nSpanish, Ontario.\nMay 30, 1952.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like to know if you have any vacancies in any of your Indian day schools in any part of Ontario.\n\nI am twenty-three, Indian and Catholic. I have five years of High School with eight grade 13 subjects. Received my Normal school training in North Bay. Since then I have been teaching at the Indian girls' Residential...\nschool in Spanish. I have been teaching the senior grades mostly during these three years. I would now like some experience in the Indian day schools.\n\nI have seen your salary schedule for the Indian day school staff.

It would be necessary for you to ascertain, however, that arrangements for correspondence could be made with the University from which you are taking your studies.\n\nIf you are interested in employment in British Columbia, there are a number of vacancies in that province requiring the services of Roman Catholic teachers, and it is possible that you and Mr. Murphy could be appointed to a two-room school or at least to schools in the same locality.

We did hear that one of the teachers at the main two-room school in West Bay was leaving. We should be very glad to know if there is any chance of our getting that school. Father McKay is there and knows us both, since he was stationed at this school. The set-up attracts us, and we would appreciate hearing from you as to the possibility of our getting the school.\n\nIf there are any other two-room schools available, we should be glad to hear from you as to salaries, location and living accommodations.\nGarnier Residential School\nSpanish, Ontario\n\nI have an Interim Second Class Certificate, and I hope to obtain an Interim First Class Certificate by August by writing one Upper School subject.\n\nWe have been assured by Mr. Mr. H.

In April I received several offers of good positions, but I was interested in the work at Ryerson, as I had visited with Miss Johnston there several times, and we had discussed projects that could be carried out in that school. I contacted you and Mr. Mingey in Toronto, but received no definite answer then. As I did not feel that I could refuse all the good offers that I had and wait until the summer to be considered, I accepted one of them, and believe that I have obtained a very good position.\n\nThank you for considering me for the school.

However I had to realize that this certificate is not recognized on board Canadian ships. So, as I have done some teaching in a British School for app. 3 years, I wonder could I return into this profession here in Canada.\n\nMy wife, who is a professional teacher for handicrafts worked with the British School of Arts & Crafts for 5 years.\nAs you may tell from the enclosed testimonial, I was teaching dressmaking, leatherworks, and soft-toy making, e.g., teddy bears, to give an explanation to that subject.\n\nI, myself, worked in the management of the school under the British Officer in charge. Besides this duty, I was teaching in \"Commercial Advertising,\" which included sign-writing, and \"Handicraft Plastics,\" a subject which I introduced to the School, but you will not find mentioned in the annotation or the testimonial.\n\nShould these qualifications be of any interest to you, we are eager to hear of you soon, provided that both of us, my wife and me, can find employment up there.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCh.

He is entirely trustworthy and in addition to his other duties has been responsible for the care and safety of all equipment, materials, and books held in the school which total to many thousands of pounds.\n\nOwing to the nature of his duties it has been necessary for Herrn Sandberg and myself to work in close contact with one another which has given me an insight into his excellent character and education, which is of a high standard.

Kindly inform me if you are in need of a teacher soon.\n\nI have had the usual education for ordination to the Ministry and I am fairly well acquainted with the ways and habits of Indians and\nhalf-breed.

Grisdale,\nMiss Gertrude Pitawankwah.\n\nI have your letter of June 2 concerning the above-named teachers.\n\nThe two men are excellent teachers. Miss Pitawankwah is an average teacher who is rather diffident. I would think a question in my mind as to her ability to carry on in the school where she was alone.\n\nYou might put an advertisement in the Toronto papers for teachers to fill the vacant schools, but I am doubtful if you will get applicants to take any of these positions at the first, second or third years of our starting range. The Federation has advised students going out the Normal Schools not to accept schools under the salary of $200 for the first year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.G. Mingay,\nInspector of Schools.\nDear Sir,\n\nI read your advertisement in \"The Evening\" and would like to have further details concerning these Indian schools.\n\nI am a graduate from the Ottawa Normal School where I obtained a teaching certificate. I have eight years of experience in teaching and have been principal of a four-room school in Tal Rota, Ontario, for the last four years. I would like to teach in one of these schools preferably in British Columbia for one year.\n\nAn immediate answer\nwould be appreciated as I am about to sign a contract with the Finance Board for next September.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Ms) Julie Liberte\nMiss Gisele Laliberte,\nValrita, Ont.\n\nDear Miss Laliberte:\n\nIn reply to your recent letter concerning employment in an Indian school, we are forwarding to you a standard application form which we would like you to complete and return.\n\nThe completion of this form obligates you in no way but gives us the necessary information to determine the classification and salary to which your qualifications and experience entitle you and provides the basis for further correspondence.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nChief, Superintendent of Education.\n\nP.S.

Our school has been selected to participate in a special program called \"Indian Boarding School\" which will begin next year. This program aims to provide our children with better educational opportunities.\n\nI understand that this may be a difficult decision for you, but I believe it is in the best interest of our children. The program offers a chance for them to receive a quality education and prepare for their future.\n\nPlease let me know how you feel about this proposal. I would appreciate your input as we navigate this new chapter in our school's history.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\nDear sir,\n\nI have often had the desire to go and live in the far north, but having no specific training and not knowing where to apply, I have never done anything about it. After seeing the ad (above) in \"The Evening\", I want to apply for it and feel myself able to fill the position.\n\nI was born and raised in a French Canadian village 16 miles south of Winnipeg where I attended convent school as a boarder and finished grade VII. I have now been living in Winnipeg for over two years working at office jobs. Presently I am working with the Women's Division of the Unemployment Insurance Commission. I have never really accustomed myself to the city and neither do I like office work very\nmuch. I will be 21 years old in December, am 5'7\" tall, 130 lbs, single, have grade 7 education, speak and write French and English very well. My health is excellent except for an occasional cold!\n\nI do hope that you will consider my application and in return, I promise to give you my best in skill and good will.\n\nYours truly,\nAnita Delorme\n\n[Signature]\nApplication from Miss A.

They are required before the name of a teacher can be placed on our salary list.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEncl:\n1-1-1 X\n\n[Handwritten note]\n\nJUN 23 1952\nREGISTERED\nRECORDS\nINDIAN\nAFFAIRS\n\n1143 Westmount Rd.,\nMontreal, June 21, 1952.\n\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMy interest in reaching out for a position in your Boarding School stems in large measure from conversations with a graduate nurse who is a member of our Church. This lady, trained here, served two years in one of the Boarding schools out west. Life in the Institution was no bed of roses. But she loved the Indian children and she declare they were the best patients she ever nursed. Not one pupil of the school reached High School Entrance while she was there. She attributes the poor showing to the fact that \"permit teachers were engaged, who knew little about how to present the subject matter or to make the lessons...\"\ninteresting. Teaching appointments there are made, she said, by the Principal, a fine man.\n\nThe lady still gets letters from former pupils of the schools, and when she mentioned recently that one of the teachers would be leaving at the end of June, I applied. As a matter of fact, a sister mine lives about sixty miles from the school. And since my husband's death last winter, life here has been lonely. I have no dependents and I like underprivileged children. Besides while teaching county school in Ontario, I always kept pupil up for Entrance. We never had a failure; so I feel that I could enlist the Indian children's cooperation too and bring them right along.\n\nWell, the Principal wants to hire me, but he states: \"Our teachers are on terms; we pay $150 a year and maintenance (I presume for ten months of each year).\"\nI am familiar with the Indian Affairs' salary schedule for teachers holding Permanent First Class certificates. And while I am not \"commercially minded,\" I still subscribe to the theory that a workman is worthy of his hire. If I contribute my services to the work of educating Indians, I shall work hard; I should hope to receive the same treatment as certain other Civil Service teachers with precisely the same qualifications doing precisely the same work in certain other Indian schools in Canada.\n\nSo, I explained in my reply that, in view of the very modest stipend offered, I preferred to let the matter simmer for a few days. And I promptly wrote to you to determine whether duly qualified teachers in Prairie Boarding Schools for Indian children would finally be expected to serve for about nine\nhundred dollars and board for\nyear, or whether this meager sal-\nary is supplemented by grants\nfrom the Indian Affairs Branch,\nbringing prairie teachers' income\nup to that which similarly\nqualified teachers are paid for\ndoing similar work with Indian\nboys and girls in Brantford and\nAlbany schools.\n\nIf assurance of the same\nfinancial treatment is forth-\ncoming, my reply to the second\nlast question on page one of the\napplication form that you sent\nwill read \"Twenty-five years or\nmore,\" but if ninety-dollar\ntreatment is to prevail, I pre-\nfer not to apply at all. And\nconcerning the last question on\nthe same page, I should be\nhappy to report for duty on\nSeptember 1st next. But I have\nI thought of expressing such willingness in writing until\nmy salary question is clarified\u2014an attitude which I\nfeel sure you will readily understand. As our friend\nfriends say, all feet move.\n\nAnd so, I am wondering,\nMrs. Phelan, whether you will be\nkind enough to clarify unmistakably\nthe point indicated in the question at\nthe bottom of this letter. Will you kindly tell me\nafter fifteen years, the age at which a time\nbecomes eligible to retire on pension?\nIf, on the other hand, she prefers to\ncontinue teaching, until what age\ndo the regulations permit her to do\nthis?\n\nThanking you in anticipation\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMrs. Eliza Anglehart.\nJuly 2nd, 1952.\n\nMrs. Eliza Inglehart,\n1193 Bishop Street,\nMontreal,\nP. Q.\n\nDear Mrs. Inglehart:\n\nWe regret that we cannot advise you what classification and salary you would be entitled to receive on our 1951 salary schedule until we have received the completed application form which was sent to you on June 21, 1952. As previously stated the completion of this form obligates you in no way.\n\nThe Education Division of the Indian Affairs Branch pays the salary of teachers employed in all Indian Day Schools and in a few Residential Schools. In all other Residential Schools the salaries of the teachers are paid by the Administration of the Residential School.\n\nRetirement of teachers is voluntary at 60 and compulsory at age 65. Before retirement to pension a teacher must have qualified for permanent employment in an Indian School in compliance with the requirements of the Civil Service Superannuation Act.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nAM: GFB\nSince we have now reached mid-June and contracts for the schools at Fond du Lac and Stony Rapids only have been awarded, it would seem reasonable to assume that whatever other building may be started in the current fiscal year, it cannot be ready for September 1st, 1952. I am, therefore, assuming that these two are the only new schools for which I shall be required to find teachers. Would you please confirm this?\n\nI would suggest that teachers for these two schools be appointed now or when they can be procured and that they be dispatched to the schools on September 1st whether they are completely finished or not. Local arrangements with the missionaries could be made to commence the school work in temporary quarters at the missions until such time as the school buildings are ready. In making this suggestion, I have in mind the teacher shortage. After July 15th there isn't a really suitable teacher to be had. My teacher appointment problem is further aggravated by my absence from my desk at Calgary during the month of July. While I shall be doing my office work in Victoria as usual, there will be some delay in answering letters and I shall not be able to interview prospective teachers personally. Because of this situation I am endeavouring to have all of my teacher vacancies filled by June 27.\n\nIt is suggested that any other new schools still under construction in September 1952 remain unused until the following September. This will avoid any hasty finishing work and will enable me to get good teachers for them.\n\nL. G. P. Walker,\nInspector of Schools.\nFORT WILLIAM SANATORIUM\nFORT WILLIAM, ONTARIO\n\nJune 19, 1952\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI must apologize for the delay in replying to your letter of June 11th, as I have been contacting every Catholic teacher in the community concerning the possibility of securing someone to replace Mrs. Vaillant whom we are sorry to lose.\n\nNow, however, I have much pleasure in recommending Miss Elizabeth Heney whose application I enclose herein. I advised Miss Heney to send a duplicate application to the local school secretary, Mr. H. Johnston, at the Sanatorium.\n\nMiss Heney is a member of an outstanding Catholic family, has an excellent teaching record, and I am sure she will be a decided asset to our staff should her application be accepted.\n\nI wish to express my appreciation of this opportunity to interest one of my own faith in this very worthy cause. As far as I am concerned, this matter will remain strictly confidential, as my school board are not aware that I have received any communication from you.\n\nAssuring you of my co-operation at all times,\n\nI am, sincerely,\n\nMary Duggan,\nPrincipal Sanatorium School,\nFort William, Ontario.\n271 Francis St., W.,\nFort William, Ont.,\nJune 17, 1952.\n\nEducational Department,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI have been informed that there is an opening on the part-time teaching staff of the Fort William Sanatorium.

I have applications from five qualified teachers.\n\n(1) Edgar MacNeil, 149 Reserve Street, Glace Bay, N.S., 21 years of age (in August), Senior Matriculation and Provincial Normal College, holding a Superior First Class License in the Province of Nova Scotia and has two years teaching experience. This young man comes from a good family and is well liked in his present position as teacher, Gillisville, Cape Breton, N.S.\n\n(2) Christina Morrison, Horn's Road, N.S., a teacher of considerable experience and now engaged in the primary department in the school at St. Peters, N.S. She has a high school teaching license. She is not a Roman Catholic and as the children of this school are 100% of that faith I presume that Section 120 of the Indian Act would apply.\n\n(3) Frank McNeil, 520 First Street, Glace Bay, N.S., has a B.A. Degree from St. Francis Xavier University and holds a Superior First Class License with a major in social sciences. He has no teaching experience. I personally interviewed this man and explained the situation at Nyanza to him in detail and he advised that if I did not hear from him within a week he was no longer interested; the week has expired and I presume he has withdrawn his application.\n\n...........2\nMiss Mary E. Nearing, 283 Macleod's Road, Glace Bay, N.S., a teacher with a Superior First Class License and one year experience. She is of good character and apparently quite capable.\n\nMiss Agnes Tompkins, North East Margaree, holds a Superior First Class License and possesses four years teaching experience - three after securing her license and one year prior to it. I interviewed her personally and feel that of the group she is the most acceptable and possibly the most adaptable type to this area. She is President of the Home and School Association, Secretary of the C.Y.O. in that area and Treasurer of the School Credit Unions. She is now attending summer school and specializing in primary methods. Selecting her as the most suitable of the group, I wrote her school inspector and received the attached recommendation.\n\nThe Middle River Indian Day School has a preponderance of young children and the highest grade will be Grade 6. This reserve has been the most backward of all in this Agency and I look forward to some good work being accomplished by a competent teacher. Considering all factors I prefer a female teacher and in view of all available information I feel that Miss Tompkins is the best qualified of the group.\n\nI feel that this applicant should be accepted immediately but await your confirmation before doing so. An acknowledgment by wire would be appreciated.\n\n[Signature]\nP.B. McKinnon,\nRegional Supervisor,\nIndian Agencies.\n\nFBM/rmn\n149 Reserve Street,\nGlace Bay, N.S.,\nJune 15, 1952.\n\nMr. J. B.

This consists of about four weeks in all, three in the schools of Antigonish county, and one week at the Indian school at Micmac, N.S.\n\nAs you have described the situation at Nyanza, I feel it presents a challenge. My own life has been a challenge for a number of years now. I left school at an early age not then having completed the tenth grade. In 1940 I began to study at home, and in the space of two years finished my Senior Matriculation. I entered university in 1948 and was graduated in 1951. This year I completed the studies necessary to the High School Teacher's License.\n\nOutside of my formal training in the school and college subjects, I took part in the affairs of the parish, and for three years served as president of the C.Y.O. here in St. John's Parish.\n\nSince I have always felt some of the missionary spirit, I do feel that a teaching position among the Indians would afford me great personal satisfaction.\nFor the past number of years I have been employed at the Glace Bay Post Office as a letter carrier, and am at present a permanent member of the staff.\n\nI can supply any number of referees for character and work references among them\n\nMr. Peter Mc Kinley, Postmaster, Glace Bay, N.S.,\nRev.

My permanent position has been with the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, where I am in charge of Children's Education in Art.\n\nLast year and this one also, I have been a volunteer teacher of Indians and Esquimos at the Camsell Hospital. I must say it has been one of the most interesting and rewarding jobs I have ever had. The Matron, Miss Taylor, nurses and nurses have all been most co-operating toward my efforts. My method of work is to give these natives the opportunity of expressing their own talents, but I make very few suggestions, but I do study the materials I give them as suitable for a child who is in bed and who has had practically no previous art training. As a result I have a valuable collection of work from young and old - drawings, paintings, plastering models - card-board ships, wire horses; and plenty of variety of work from Esquimos also. I leave the University on August 18 and am going to the coast.\n\nMiss Tench a teacher of Indians near here suggested I write you and ask if the Indian Department would take me on a coastal ship to Indian Missions in B.C.\n\nI also hope to work for a week at the hospital in Naimo, B.C., in order to compare the work of the Plains Indian with that of the North West Coast Indians.\n\nMay I say again Camsell Hospital has a wealth of talent there. They are in the habit of copying magazine art, which I consider an insult to any native art. Anthropologists in the East in Toronto and Montreal were astonished that there exists so much talent in drawing and painting as I had collected to show them.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Miss) Audrey A.

Phelan, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nCopeland Building,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI am having extreme difficulty in getting teachers for our schools here in Ontario.\n\nThe Bulletin Board in Normal Schools is literally plastered with offers of positions from various school boards with salaries ranging from $2000 to $2600.\n\nOur salary schedule is quite in line with the province when experience is considered. Where we are losing ground is on the initial salaries. I find it almost impossible to get anyone with a 2nd starting at less than $1800 to $2000 and people with a 1st just simply will not go out under $2000 to $2600. Most of those are folk who have had only two or three year's teaching.\n\nI suppose we could get some teachers from the Maritimes or Manitoba but we did have some criticism from Ontario M.P.'s concerning this and a suggestion that we should stick to Ontario teachers. How much attention we should pay to this, is for you to decide but I think you should be cognizant of the salary situation which obtains here at present.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.G.

Your telegram was a surprise and indeed a pleasure. I wish to thank you for the favorable consideration you gave my application and for considering me for the position of Welfare Teacher.\n\nI signed my contract with the Brooke S.O. Rivels Camp, N.W.T., June 7 because I thought my application for your schools had come to naught. Now as I stated in my telegram I would accept the position if I could obtain release.\nFor two days I have been trying to locate Captain R.O. Jones, the Official Trustee, in whom rests the decision. All we could find out\u2014Capt. Jones is on holidays until Aug. 2, at Kenora, possibly Keewatin Beach. Wing Commander Davis, commander of the camp, would like to help me but does not like to interfere in Capt. Jones' field, and also fears they might be opening school in September (short a teacher if I am released).\n\nEverything seems to be against me. To wait much longer, or until Aug. 2 will be too late for you to fill your schools. If there was any way you could help me and at the same time not leave Rivers stranded I would appreciate it, but right now it looks as if I will be unable to accept your offer.\n\nAs I told Mr. Jacobsen I would re-apply early next year. After my interview with him I had decided\nTo make teaching in the territories my work for the next phase of my life, I would greatly appreciate it if the Department would hold my application and records until next year, and I can assure you I shall be in a position to accept what you offer.\n\nOnce again thank you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nConstance Armstrong\nMiss Constance Armstrong,\nKamsack,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nDear Miss Armstrong:\n\nWe thank you for your letter of July 22nd and presume that you will have received our telegram of July 24th informing you that a teacher had been secured for the Fort Good Hope Indian Day School.\n\nIf you are interested in employment in an Indian Day School during the 1953-1954 academic year, would you be kind enough to write to this Department in March or April, 1953, when it will be possible for us to know what vacancies will be available.\n\nMay we draw to your attention the fact that Indian Day Schools are operated by the Indian Affairs Branch of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nAM:GFB\nRoom 211 Baker Tower\nCornell University,\nIthaca N.Y.\n\n1952 JUL 28 M 8:54\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am a Canadian student studying at Cornell for a Master of Science in Industrial Education.

You will not find any specifications of teaching experience as such but I have only been doing it during spare time, after working hours and with private pupils.\n\nAnyhow if you are interested in my application I am willing if requested by your regulations, to pass an examination or a test or even attend induction school in order to become familiar with your teaching methods.\n\nHoping to hear from you shortly.

Cook, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nThe Indian School Administration,\nNo. 5, Co. C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa 4, Ontario.\n\nDear Canon Cooks,\n\nWith reference to our telephone conversation this morning, I am forwarding herewith copies of our salary schedule. You will note that teachers are placed in one of four classifications, Grade I, Grade II, Grade III and Grade IV. Teachers with no certification are rated as Grade II teachers with Second Class Certificates are rated as Grade II teachers with First Class Certificates are rated as Grade III, and specialists such as primary teachers, who are specially qualified and devote at least half of the teaching time to the work in which they have had special training, are classified as Grade IV.\n\nIn general, the classification of Welfare Teacher is restricted to those schools which are located in the far north and where service is expected for twelve months of the year. We have very few of this classification, and I feel that it would be well if those to whom you are sending this information were warned that the classification is given only under very special circumstances, and after a very careful review by the department of all circumstances.\n\nA maximum of five years of credit may be given for previous experience in placing teachers on the salary scale, except where the teacher is simply being transferred from one Indian school to another. However, if there is any break in service and the teacher has more than five years' experience, the teacher starts as having five years of experience only, and is placed on the salary schedule at the sixth period.\n\n.....\nAs you are aware, teachers employed in day schools operating for the full academic year of ten months, may be classified for superannuation purposes as Civil Servants, providing they meet the qualifications, one of which is two years of satisfactory service with this department. Such a classification carries with it all the benefits of the Federal Civil Service Superannuation scheme. Immediately on appointment, however, teachers contribute to the pension fund in accordance with the provisions of the Act which apply to Civil Servants. If they make application and are accepted as Civil Servants for the purposes of superannuation, their pension contributions are transferred to their credit under this scheme. If they leave the service before they are pensionable, all their contributions are returned to them.\n\nI think it would be well if you would tell the Bishops that the department welcomes the nomination of qualified teachers from the Churches, but the actual appointment is made by the department. However, the department usually accepts the nomination, providing the teacher is qualified and there are no other grounds for anticipating that the appointment would not be satisfactory. The department, of course, has full control of all teachers employed in our day schools and may dismiss a teacher without reference to the nominating authority.\n\nThe policy outlined in the preceding paragraph has been in general practice for a number of years, and I merely mention it so that there shall be no misunderstanding.\n\nAs you know, there is at present a very acute shortage of teachers throughout Canada. A recent editorial in the \"Ottawa Citizen\" gave the number as 10,000. This is somewhat in excess of what is usually quoted, but there is no doubt that the shortage runs in the thousands. Because of this, the department must be in a position to engage teachers without delay and is not obligated to wait for the nomination of the Bishop if a suitable applicant is available. I am asking the Regional Supervisors to inform the Bishops of vacancies as soon as possible, and it would be helpful if the Bishops could submit the names of applicants immediately they are known without waiting for vacancies to occur. The department begins advertising in April for teachers for the term commencing September.\nI wish to thank you for your very kind offer to solicit the support of the Bishops of the Anglican Church in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

We should appreciate being advised if there is any other method of handling these accounts and if it would be possible in such cases to pay them from this office.\n\nW. S.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Advertising accounts -\nYour File 0-11-2\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, Cheque No. 15915 was forwarded to the Vancouver Sun on October 28th, in payment of their account dated July 22nd.\n\nWe agree with you that there is frequently considerable delay in paying advertising accounts, and in future we will watch them and make every possible endeavour to have them passed for payment sooner than they have been. However, we have our troubles also, as in some cases the newspapers simply forward an account and do not give us sufficient information to file them even, and this causes delay. When we find the file, we have to submit the account to the King's Printer for taxation before the Treasury Branch will pay it. This also causes delay.\n\nHowever, as mentioned above, we will endeavour to have the advertising accounts receive more prompt attention.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST\nChief, Education Division\nThe Montreal Star Co.

Conrad,\nRegional Inspector of Indian Schools,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nSaskatchewan Indian School Vacancies\nRef. your 3553-211/2-32 of October 9\n\nIn accordance with your request we have requested that the following advertisement be inserted in three issues of the four newspapers you listed:\n\n\"WANTED - Teachers for Indian Schools. Good salaries with furnished and heated living quarters. Pension fund.\nFor details and application forms apply to Mr. E.N. Conrad, Regional Inspector of Indian Schools, 304 Post Office Building, Regina, Sask.\"\n\nOur list of present vacancies in Saskatchewan includes Shoal Lake and Sturgeon Lake. It is noted that you have listed Shoal Lake but omitted Sturgeon Lake. Is there a reason for this omission?\n\nOur files for the Jubilee, Springside and Ochajowace Indian Day Schools state that these three new schools are to accommodate the pupils who formerly attended Round Lake Indian Residential School. (This was a United Church School)\n\nWe have no file for the Mistawasis No. 2 Indian Day School and presume that this will be second classroom of the present Mistawasis School whose teacher is Mr. J.A. Bell.\n\nYou have listed the James Smith South School. Our records show that Mrs. H.M. Ralph is the teacher at this school. Is it intended to add a second classroom?\nYou will, no doubt, have received a copy of official salary letter sent to Mr. F.J. Daniels dated October 2, 1951 advising him that he had been appointed as substitute teacher during the absence of Mr. Lowe. It is presumed that Mr. Lowe will be able to return to the Red Earth Indian Day School on January 1, 1952. Would you please submit a report on Mr. Lowe's condition sometime during the month of December indicating his probable date of return to duty.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n| DATE   | PARTICULARS                  | LINES-WORDS-INSERTS TODAY | TIMES OR RATE | CHARGES | CREDITS | BALANCE |\n|--------|------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Jul 25 51 | Citizenship & Immigration    |                           |               |         |         |         |\n| Jul 25 51 | 16745 - July 23-24-25        |                           |               |         |         |         |\n| Jul 25 51 | Order No. 1870               |                           |               |         |         |         |\n\nACCOUNTS PAYABLE WHEN RENDERED INTEREST AT 6 PER CENT CHARGED ON OVERDUE ACCOUNTS\n\nTHIS IS YOUR INVOICE AND STATEMENT COMBINED\n\nPLEASE PAY LAST AMOUNT IN THIS COLUMN\n| DATE   | PARTICULARS                  | LINES-WORDS-INSERTS | TIMES OR RATE | CHARGES | CREDITS | BALANCE |\n|--------|------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Jul 25 | Citizenship & Immigration    |                     |               |         |         |         |\n| Jul 25 | 16744 - July 23-24-25        |                     |               |         |         |         |\n| Jul 25 | Order No. 1866               |                     |               |         |         |         |\n\nACCOUNTS PAYABLE WHEN RENDERED\nINTEREST AT 6 PER CENT CHARGED ON OVERDUE ACCOUNTS\n\nTHIS IS YOUR INVOICE AND STATEMENT COMBINED\n\nPLEASE PAY LAST AMOUNT IN THIS COLUMN\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Aug. | To Cost of advertising for teachers, Fort McKay and Fort Good Hope, as per invoice attached | $2.16 |\n\nFOR USE BY INDIAN SUPERINTENDENT\n\nVoucher No. 98(205).

S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n-LM\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nAtt'n Mr. P. Phelan,\n\nRe: Congo Bridge Indian Day School -\nSt. Mary's School, Fredericton.\n\nApparently we will require a number of teachers due to some tardy resignations. I have heard through rumor lately that Miss Gilberta Alain of Burnt Church is getting married. I definitely understood when I visited that school that both teachers were remaining. I am writing to Superintendent Blakes for confirmation of this rumor. Possibly, Ottawa has received her resignation. Besides her, there is a vacancy at Maniwaki and possibly two at Fredericton and we have not yet received the acceptance of the vacant position at Park Savard Hospital. Miss Bertha Bruyere, who taught in Ontario, sent her application for this position. However, for obvious reasons, I do not think that her services would be suitable. I had two other teachers in mind and I have written to them but to date I have received no reply. I think it would be wise to advertise to obtain teachers to fill these positions.\n\nAdvertisements should be inserted in the following: Le Droit, Ottawa - La Presse, Montreal - Telegraph Journal, Saint John, N.B.- L'Action Catholique, Quebec - and the Insign, Montreal.\n\nA.J.

H. Marcoux  \nRegional Inspector of Indian Schools  \nDominion Public Building  \nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Marcoux:\n\nIt gives me pleasure to acknowledge your request of recent date for salary schedules for Flin Flon and The Pas as well as for any observations which I might wish to make regarding Indian education in general.\n\nThe requested schedules are herewith enclosed. That of Flin Flon is for the year 1952-53, and is likely to be increased in 1953-54. The schedule for The Pas is the revised schedule which will go into effect in 1953-54. The general trend in salaries will be upward again this year in Manitoba; greatly increased provincial grants have made this possible. Schools which do not follow the trend in offering increased salaries will find themselves under a great handicap in competing for the better teachers. The importance of securing competent staff for your Indian schools cannot be overemphasized.\n\nIn the North, where costs of travel are high, I have found it of help in securing teachers to offer as an added inducement free transportation, at least one way, to their schools. Nearly all of the outlying districts in my field, have at my suggestion, adopted the foregoing policy with good results. The more remote the\nschool the greater the importance of doing something to at least partially defray costs of travel.\n\nIn my view, an adequate library is only second in importance to competent staff. When a new school is built there should be a large initial expenditure for library of at least one hundred dollars. Thereafter, an expenditure of fifty dollars per room is suggested. The choice of books is extremely important for Indian children. It is also important that when ordered, the books should be available. I do not know whether you have a library staff taking care of the foregoing work or not, but the service which a competent library staff could give would be invaluable.\n\nMost teachers make use of the library requisition privileges. A few make no use of them, and others not to the fullest extent. It occurs to me that if the January bulletin carried the suggestion that salary cheques for March would be payable only after the library requisition had been received that the problem would be resolved quite readily.\n\nFrom our various discussions, I know that we are agreed upon the need for Practical Arts courses for the older pupils; also on the advisability of utilizing Visual Aids, radio programmes, and the gramophone wherever possible. I am glad to note that some headway has been made in regard to these things, and that greater progress lies ahead.\n\n-over-\nOccasionally I find a teacher of long experience and of considerable teaching ability teaching on a Grade I certificate. Where the work of such teachers has been successful over a considerable period, I would suggest that it might be in order to raise the classification for salary purposes. A case in point would be that of Mrs. Ann Graffin at Oxford House. If it is possible to do so without violating the regulations, I would be quite willing to suggest that Mrs. Graffin be given a Grade II Certificate.\n\nIn the course of my inspection work, I have noted that there is some very good singing done at many of the Indian Schools. It occurs to me that perhaps it might be possible to have such a group as the Boys' Choir at Cross Lake R.C. Residential School take part in the Musical Festival at The Pas next year. I know that they would acquit themselves well, and would be welcomed at The Pas.\n\nIn regard to Curriculum, the greatest problem in Indian schools is to achieve a satisfactory standard of oral and written expression. This will take a great deal of time and patience, but I feel that progress is being made.\n\nI am particularly pleased to note the attempt being made to staff your schools with competent teachers. This, of course, is the most immediate way of raising standards in your schools. It is also worthy of note that there is a gradually increasing\nnumber of students availing themselves of the opportunity to take advanced academic training. This is an encouraging feature. In the long run the success of this venture will be largely determined by the degree of success in placing students who have taken such training in suitable employment. As racial prejudice still exists, part of the problem lies in eliminating this barrier. Every student of an Indian school who goes out from school, and makes a success of something worthwhile is helping to make it that much easier for the next who follows.\n\nIt has been a pleasure to inspect the Indian schools in this Division during the past six years, and to note the progress which is being made. I should like to congratulate you on it.\n\nI trust that the foregoing observation may be of some assistance to you.\n\nAll best personal regards.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. P. Moffat,\nSchool Inspector\nDivision #25.\nTO ALL TEACHERS\n\nAt this time we are planning for the next academic year. Would you please indicate on this sheet whether or not you intend returning to the same school next year, by simply putting a check mark on this form and returning it to this office immediately.\n\nIf we have not received a completed form from a teacher by the 15th of May we shall have to communicate again with the teacher in question.\n\nName of school ........................................................\n\nAgency ...........................................................................\n\nTeacher's name ..............................................................\n\nI intend to return ..........................................................\n\nI do not intend to return ..................................................\n\nI would like a transfer .....................................................\n\nI am not sure but will know on .........................................\n\nRemarks, if any ...............................................................\n\n..........................................................................................\n\n..........................................................................................\n\nIf you do not intend to continue as a teacher with the Department please send in a resignation not later than June 1, 1965.\n\nR.

ARNEIL DATED APRIL 10, 1953,\nADDRESSED TO INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nORIGIAL ON 1-1-LK.\n\nReference is made to the Department's letter of April 2nd concerning the suggested advertisement the Department plans to insert in the Vancouver Sun and the Vancouver Daily Province, no amendments are considered necessary. It is recommended, however, that a similar advertisement be run in Eastern papers as the Eastern provinces have in the past provided us with very good teaching material.\n\nIt occurs to me that an advertisement in the Times Educational Supplement, Fleet Street, London, or in Teachers' World and Bulletin, London, England, might bear fruit. Information has occasionally been requested by teachers in the United Kingdom.\"\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\n1953 APR 13 AM 9:11\n55B, St. Joseph St., Quebec,\nApril 9, 1953.\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nAtt'n Mr. P. Phelan.\n\nRe: Vacancies.\n\nOur teachers have all been notified that their resignations must be into this office at latest May the 15th. We have in this district but one teacher that does not seem to be suitable and I believe Mr. Baker has notified you of this fact. I am referring to Miss Carbonneau who is teaching at the Congo Bridge Indian Day School.\n\nI do not think that there will be any necessity to advertise for teachers for the next term. We have a number of names of teachers that are interested and should there be any vacancies occurring I think there will be no difficulty in filling them.\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nAJD/er\nRegional Inspector of Indian Schools.\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\n628 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta,\nApril 11, 1953.\n\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Teachers - Employment\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 2nd, file 1-1-LX-2 (EF), we fully agree with your suggestion that advertisements for teachers should be inserted in the two chief Alberta papers at an early date. I have already sent out letters to teacher training institutions and have received a number of inquiries. The advertisement as worded in your letter is adequate, but change 620 to 628.\n\nThe only teacher that cannot be re-employed next year is Mr. Sealy of Saddle Lake School. He came to us from Ontario, hired by mail at the end of August when we were desperate for Catholic teachers. He is far too incompetent and immature. Both Mr. Racette's and my report indicate the inadvisability of retaining him.\n\nL. G. P. Waller,\nInspector of Schools.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttn. Mr. P. Phelan, Superintendent of Education\n\nWe have your letter of April 4, 1953, file No. 1-1-LX-2 (E7) re teacher vacancies and advertisements.\n\nWe have already sent a circular letter to all teachers an exact copy of which is attached. The answers are coming in now and we hope to have them all in by May 1st.\n\nIt will be very difficult to secure the services of teachers this year due to the considerable increase in the Government school grants which in turn reflects on the salaries paid the teachers.\n\nWe are sending you a copy of a letter received from Inspector Moffat of The Pas which gives the salary schedules of the northern part of the Province, also a copy of a letter received from the Registrar of the Department of Education giving the salary schedule for permit teachers in this Province.\n\nAfter perusing this material you will probably agree that we will have to do something about our initial salaries if we want to secure teachers for next year.\n\nRegarding the advertisement, please note that our offices are now at 309 Hargrave Street instead of 537 Dominion Public Building. I think that the first of May will be the right time to have it in the newspaper.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nI am also enclosing a paper clipping showing the teacher salary trend.\n**DEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION**\n\nApril 21, 1953\n\nTo the Dept.

I have two comments to make regarding the proposed advertisement. First I note that this would be published only in English papers. I feel that good teachers might be attracted from Scotland and Ireland, if we could draw this offer to their attention. I believe that the text of the suggested advertisement is rather lengthy. As you know, the cost of advertising in United Kingdom is very expensive, especially if you advertise in metropolitan papers.\n\nIn view of the foregoing may I suggest that you authorize Superintendent L.G. Cumming, London, to place certain advertisements in some selected papers in Scotland, Ireland and England, at his discretion and at the lowest possible cost.\n\nLaval Fortier.\nOttawa, May 4th, 1953.\n\nMr. W.S.

If you consider the cost of advertising in both papers excessive, will you select one of the two mentioned above or use any other alternative which, in your judgment, will give the optimum results.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAttach.\n\nLaval Fortier.\nWANTED: TRAINED and experienced teachers for Indian schools in Western Canada.

This would result in a delay in appointment which might preclude the securing of a number of English teachers for the coming academic year.\n\nDirector.\n\nAttach.\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nIMMIGRATION BRANCH\n\nOTTAWA, May 9, 1953.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. D.

Mr. P. Phelan, Superintendent of Education\n\nWe have your wire of June 22, 1953, concerning advertisement for teachers. We feel that further advertising is necessary.\n\nWe still have vacancies at the following schools:\n\nAnglican\nPeguis #4\nChamawawin (Cedar Lake)\nSplit Lake\nJack River\n\nRoman Catholic\nCross Lake\nLittle Grand Rapids\n\nUnited Church\nOxford House #2\nGods Lake\nIsland Lake\nIsland Lake (new)\nSagitawack\nLong Plain #2\n\nBefore advertising again, however, we feel that a decision should be made regarding the salaries to be paid. If you would please refer to our letter of June 15, 1953, you will realize the need for a revision of the salary schedule in the lower bracket.\n\nMay we be authorized to draft the advertisement and send it direct to the newspaper?\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nJuly 2nd, 1953.\n\nAttention: Mr. A.J. Doucet\n\nMr. J. D'Astous,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n55 B.St. Joseph Street,\nQuebec 2, P.Q.\n\nAs previously advised the Department has written to United Church authorities requesting nominations for the vacancies at the Caughnawaga U.C. and the Oka Country Indian Day Schools. If it is possible for you to secure the services of suitable applicants for these schools, we suggest that you notify us immediately in order that we may refer their names to the United Church authorities who, to date, have not submitted any names of teachers for approval.\n\nWe have not yet received your recommendations for the employment of two teachers at the Manouan Indian Day School.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nAM: GFB\nJuly 2nd, 1953.\n\nMr. J.P.B.

Marcoux  \nJuly 2nd, 1953.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,  \nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,  \nNorlyn Building,  \n309 Hargrave Street,  \nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nTo authorize higher salary payment to teachers in the lower bracket, it would be necessary to revise our salary schedule with the approval of Treasury Board. Although no action is being taken at present, if a general salary increase is obtained for civil servants, the Department intends to request authority to revise the Indian School Teachers' salary schedule and obtain authority for a higher salary payment.\n\nUnder present regulations, it is necessary that all advertising be routed through the Department of Public Printing and Stationery. Would you, therefore, forward to us your recommendations concerning the advertisement you wish to have placed in local newspapers. We shall be pleased to comply with your request in this regard. As a result of advertising in the \"Times Educational Supplement,\" London, England, a number of applications from the United Kingdom have been received. An arrangement has been made with the Canadian Immigration Officers in Great Britain to interview teacher applicants referred to them. To date we have referred the names of five applicants to whom a specific position in an Indian Day School in the province of British Columbia has been offered. There will, of course, be a slight delay in finalizing these appointments in view of the necessity of arranging an interview and receiving the recommendations of the Immigration Officers. Please let us know if you would be interested in receiving for perusal some of the letters of application which have been received from teachers in the United Kingdom.\n\nPhilip Phelan  \nSuperintendent of Education\n\nAN: GFB\nDEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\n628 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta,\nJune 26, 1953.\n\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Advertisement - Teachers\n\nWith reference to your telegram of June 22nd concerning advertisement for teachers, I do not think further advertising is necessary, although a few vacancies remain.\n\nIf I think we should resort to additional advertising, I will advise you.\n\nL.

F. Davey\n\nRe: Teacher Vacancies and Advertisements.\n\nI refer to my letter of April 10th, in which it was recommended that an advertisement for teachers be run in Eastern papers as well as in our Vancouver dailies. Responses from the Prairies and Eastern Provinces have been almost non-existent and because many teachers from those areas have made application in former years, it occurs to me that the Eastern Press may have been overlooked several months ago when advertisements were placed. As it is impossible to staff our B.C. schools without drawing on applicants from the East, I would request that an advertisement for teachers for the Indian schools in this province be inserted in Eastern publications as quickly as possible.\n\nMr. Parminter is deeply concerned over the poor response he is experiencing and requests that this matter be regarded as urgent.\n\nW.

Phelan\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 2, 1953, your file 1-1-LX-2(87) and our telephone conversation regarding higher salary for permit teachers, I am sending you a copy of the letter sent by the Minister of Education for the Province of Manitoba, to the Registrar of the Department of Education. This letter means that school districts have to pay their teachers according to their schedule. It means also, that since we still have vacancies in our schools and that the only supply left will be permit teachers, now attending the short course, we should pay according to the schedule as set by the Ministry of Education. We have realized that a revision of our schedule would have to be submitted to the Treasury Branch. If it were at all possible to have this done by the beginning of August, I think we would get enough teachers to fill our schools.\n\nEnclosed you will find the advertisement I would like to have placed in local newspapers; The Free Press, The Winnipeg Tribune and The Prairie Farmer.\n\nI would like to receive some of the letters of application from teachers in the United Kingdom.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nGHM/VS\n\nEnc.: G. H. Marcoux,\nRegional Inspector of Indian Schools for Manitoba.\nJuly 29, 1953.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nNorlyn Building,\n309 Margrave Street,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nYour 217/2-32\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 16th it would appear from the Minister of Education's letter of April 21st, that our salary schedule is not far out of line, having in mind the living accommodation which we supply at most of our schools. However, in any case, it is impossible to secure an amendment to the existing salary schedule in time to be of any use for the coming academic year. However, I would appreciate very much having a submission from you which would justify as far as your region is concerned, a revision in our salary schedule. When making such a submission, would you please take into consideration the fact that we may be required to make such a deduction from salary for living accommodation. In other words, will you submit suggested salary schedules, one to be on the present basis and the other based on the assumption that living accommodation is not to be provided free of charge. It will be necessary for you to support your submission with sample schedules in effect in rural areas in the Province of Manitoba.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nCopies sent to: Mr. Mingeay  \nMr. Marceaux  \nMr. Waller  \nMr. Cairns  \nMr. Parmenter  \nMr. Doucet  \n\nJuly 29, 1953.\n\nOf recent months we have received several representations that our salary schedule for teachers is not keeping pace with those in force in various provincial rural areas but we have not received any concrete evidence which would support this statement. If you feel that our salaries are not in line with those paid in rural provincial areas, I would appreciate having from you a submission indicating the salary schedule which you think should be in force. Your submission should, of course, be supported by sample provincial schedules.\n\nIt may be that the policy of providing free living accommodation will have to be changed. I would, therefore, appreciate your bearing this in mind and indicating in your submission an alternative schedule which should be effective if living accommodation is not provided free of charge.\n\nIf you believe our salary schedule is comparable or better than the schedule in effect in the rural provincial areas of your region, I shall appreciate your informing me of this.\n\nPhilip Nelson,  \nSuperintendent of Education.\nRegina, July 31st, 1953.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Advertisement\n\nAs yet no reply re advertisement request in letter of July 13th. Our acceptance of Mrs. Wells' transfer just adds one more vacancy. The undermentioned ad, almost a repeat of July 13th letter, indicates schools now without teachers. Would you please check as to advisability of ad, and if considered wise, place with proper quarters and advise us.\n\nTeacher prospects are very few. It is possible that Mr. Calver will be taking Onion Lake, but in a phone call to Mr. Ostrander he indicated his disappointment that residence being 2\u00bd miles from school, his two young boys would have a long trek.

Since this continued not to appear, the Regina Leader Post was contacted this morning, and oddly enough the order to print had just arrived and would not appear till tomorrow. In short, this means that it took from July 13th at this end to August 12th to get an advertisement placed.\n\nI think you will agree that such a delay diminishes value of such an advertisement and some other system of approval would mean a great deal to us in future needs.\n\nJohn D.

However, we will do all possible to expedite the procedure.\n\nAll advertisements sponsored by the Dominion Government must be routed through the office of the Queen's Printer. To offset the necessary delay entailed by this procedure, we recommend that you submit to the Department requests for placement of advertisements at least two weeks in advance of the date you wish the advertisement to appear.\n\nR. F. Davey\nActing Superintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Advertisements for Teachers.\n\nI refer to the Department's letter of August 31st, in which information as to the date of insertion of the recent advertisement for teachers is requested.\n\nThe advertisement appeared in Vancouver papers on August 31st, as requested, and I believe was inserted in the editions of the following two days. Although last minute changes of plans by teacher applicants often presents problems in anticipation, in the future we will endeavour to request advertisements at least two weeks in advance of the date we wish them to appear in the papers, as per your instructions.\n\nW.

Then your plan will work out all right and I am convinced that it will be a very decided improvement.\n\nHerewith I enclose an example of how the matter would work out without the adjustment.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nP.H.

If any have been overlooked in this regard, adjustment will be made later. It is therefore considered that the new plan will work out satisfactorily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of letter 1-1-3 of September 17th, giving the new rates of payment for day school teachers.\n\nThe Shoal Lake teacher began school on August 20th last and the Chemawawin teacher on the 27th August. Under the new arrangement these men will not be paid for August work, and I beg to recommend that they be given an allowance for this work, as the new circular was received after the work was done. A bonus for August might be considered sufficient.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report the receipt of the following communication, from Russell T. Perrier Esq., Superintendent of Indian Education, Ottawa, dated September 17th inst:-\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, September 17, 1923.\n\nTo Indian Agents and Teachers of Indian Day Schools.\n\n\"Salaries of day school teachers, in the future, as in the past, will be paid at the end of September, December, March and June on receipt of the quarterly School Returns. It has been decided, however, to pay these salaries on the basis of ten teaching months in the school year.\n\n\"For example, a teacher who is being paid salary at the rate of $500.00 a year will receive $60.00 at the end of September, and $180.00 at the end of each of the three other quarters, provided the school is open. Bonus will be paid, as in the past, at the rate of $15.00 a teaching month, as long as it is provided by law.\n\n\"Please inform all the day school teachers in your Agency. Copies of this communication are being enclosed for that purpose. (Sd.) Russell F. Perrier, Superintendent of Indian Education.\n\nWith reference to the above, I would be pleased to know whether it affects the teaching staff at Massett Indian Reserve:\n\nMr. W. J. K. Pamplin has been engaged at a yearly salary of $500.00. The Indian School Teacher Messrs. Peter Hall and Alfred Adams were engaged at the rate of $75.00 per month, while the school is open. It has been customary, to send in Pay Lists, for these teachers, monthly.\n\nMiss Ethel MacKay, of Skidegate Indian Day School, receives her salary through the Methodist Missionary Society, and will, no doubt, continue to receive her salary, through said society.\n\nIf Mr. Pamplin is paid, at the rate of $500.00 per annum, will I forward monthly vouchers, in his favour, for $60.00 per month? Also Vouchers for the Indian Teachers, when engaged, at the rate of $75.00 per month, when on duty?\n\nI understand the letter, from Mr. Perrier, applies to schools, where the Missionary Society submits the Pay List, which is paid, on the production of the Quarterly Reports.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 16, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to the payment of salaries of the teachers of the Indian day schools on the Queen Charlotte agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the salary of Peter Hill and Alfred Adams, when engaged in the school, will be paid as formerly, namely, on receipt of a pay-list from you. I would point out, however, that at the end of each quarter, the usual quarterly return, showing the names of the pupils, days taught, etc., must be forwarded. This should be signed by the teacher. The September quarter return has not yet been received and, consequently, the salary of Peter Hill, for the month of September, cannot be paid.\n\nAs you have already been advised, Mr. Pamplin will be allowed salary at the rate of $800.00 per annum for the ten teaching months. It will not be necessary for you to forward monthly vouchers in his favour, as his salary will be paid quarterly on receipt of a return from the school.\n\nThe salary of Miss MacKay, teacher of the Skidegate Indian Day School, will be forwarded in the future as in the past, to the Treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nThos.

A.\nOttawa, May 11, 1925.\n\nThe information regarding the teachers in Indian Day Schools furnished to the Dominion Bureau of Statistics for the month of April was obtained in the following manner:\n\n| Monthly Salary |\n|----------------|\n| 12 Teachers paid partly from Band and partly from Vote | $555 |\n| 211 Teachers paid wholly from Vote | 13,434 |\n| Increase in lieu of bonus (223 teachers @ $15 each) | 3,345 |\n| 6 Teachers-(Combined white & Indian Schools) | 220 |\n\nTotal - 229 Teachers at monthly salary .................. $17,554\n\nIn addition to the above there are the following teachers who are paid wholly from Band Funds:\n\n(a) 13 Teachers in the Six Nations Schools.\n(b) 27 Teachers in other Indian Day Schools.\nOttawa, May 11, 1925.\n\nBefore preparing the April report for the Bureau of Statistics, I went over the accounts of the different Indian day schools and obtained the following information:\n\n55 Janitors at monthly salary .................. $342.74\n19 Truant Officers\n13 Truant Officers & Caretakers (Combined position) .. 203.50\n\nTotal ........87 Part time employees......................... $546.24\n\nIn addition to the above, there are 25 teachers who also act as caretakers. These are paid at the rate of $88.58 a month.\n\nAll the above amounts are calculated on the basis of twelve months in the year.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nJune 22, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nFor the past six fiscal years, the Department of Indian Affairs has paid bonus at a flat rate of $150 each to Indian day school teachers. This practice was confirmed by Orders in Council dated 11th November, 1922, (P.C. 2341) and 21st June, 1924, (P.C. 1036).\n\nOrder in Council dated 6th May, 1925, (P.C. 1/712) provided new ranges of compensation with a view to the discontinuance of the cost of living bonus. Section B. of Section II of Civil Service Regulations re bonus and salary, approved by this Order in Council, appears to be sufficient authority for adding $150 to the salary of each teacher and I propose, with your approval, to make payments for the June quarter at the new rate.\n\nI understand that Miscellaneous Vote No. 492 (which provides, subject to the approval of the Treasury Board, for salaries, reclassification, revision, promotions and increases) includes the item which was placed in our Supplementary Estimates to care for this increase to Indian day school teachers. At the end of the fiscal year, arrangements will have to be made for a transfer from this Vote to Indian Education of the funds necessary to pay such increase.\n\nRussell J.

FOR FILE.\n\nI have made a study of payments that have been made to teachers of Indian day schools upon retirement. The Department has decided that, whereas they appear to be in the class known as 'temporary Civil Servants', they are not eligible for superannuation under the 1924 Act. (See file #129-19).\n\nI have learned that in the past there have been payments of a gratuity or retiring allowance in the case of 9 teachers. (See list attached). The amounts of the payments varied from 2 to 6 months' salary. Vouchers were prepared showing that the payments were retiring allowances or gratuities. No authority was secured other than that of the Deputy Superintendent General, and on one or two occasions that of the Hon. the Minister. The Auditor General to my knowledge - and I have carefully examined the files - has never questioned these payments.\n\nIt was the Department's wish to give a gratuity in the case of the teacher of the Skawah Indian School, who suffered from ill-health during the last few months of his incumbency, and died during the summer months. Mr. Paget and Mr. MacKenzie are of the opinion that authority is necessary before any payment of more than 2 months' salary can be given. I phoned Mr. Douglas, of the Auditor General's Department, and he concurs in this opinion.\n\nOn at least three occasions (see list attached), teachers of Indian day schools, who have given long service, have been granted not only two months' gratuity but an annuity. Authority of His Excellency in Council was secured for each of these actions.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDecember 28, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nLyman W. Fisher was teacher at the Rock Settlement Day School up to June 30th, last. He was replaced by a professionally qualified worker. Mr. Fisher has been employed by this Department continuously since January 1, 1906\u2014a period of 19\u00bd years. His service might be characterized as faithful. He is now 45 years of age.\n\nMr. Fisher has applied for a gratuity and he wishes it applied on a Soldier Settlement loan of $1500 which he took over in 1922. He has made payments on this loan to the amount of $384.89. There was due and payable in November an instalment balance of $57.66 and when this is paid there will be a total owing of $1041.04.\n\nI wish to recommend that a gratuity of $260, which is equivalent to four months' salary, be allowed. Precedent for such a payment is established by eight gratuities, equivalent to more than two months' salary, in the case of retiring teachers of Indian day schools since 1907\u2014which payments have not been questioned.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n## SUMMARY (Fiscal Year 1925-1926)\n\n| Province                  | No. of Teachers | Total No. of Months

Scott,\n\nIn June, last, the Department decided to add $15 per teaching month to the salary of each teacher at Indian day schools. The authority was P.C. 1/712, dated May 6, 1925, which provided new ranges of compensation with a view to the discontinuance of the Cost of Living Bonus. Miscellaneous Vote No. 492 provides, subject to the approval of the Treasury Board, for such increases. The Treasury Board advised you at that time that the item need not be placed in our Supplementary Estimates, Indian Education, but that at the end of the fiscal year arrangements should be made for the transfer from Vote 492 to Indian Education of the funds necessary to pay such increases.\n\nMr. MacInnes and I have discussed the matter and I suggest that the Treasury Board be approached as follows:\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to request that authority be granted for the expenditure of $35,031.25 for the payment of salary and bonus increases and adjustments for teachers of Indian day schools in the employ of the Department of Indian Affairs, as provided by Parliamentary Appropriation, Vote No. 492, 1925, and pursuant to the provisions and requirements of an Order of His Excellency in Council of May 6, 1925, respecting the regrading of certain classes of civil servants and regulations made under authority thereof by the Civil Service Commission. The said increases and adjustments are shown in detail in a statement which is appended hereto.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nN.B. - Minute of the Treasury Board, dated 11th September, 1925, states that $83,950 was included in Vote No. 492, 1925, for the use of the Department of Indian Affairs - salary adjustments outside service - see File 339996-11.\n\nActed as $45,974.03 in this vote; Shortage $39,000 nearly.\nFebruary 18, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nDuring the fiscal years 1918-19 to 1924-25 teachers of Indian day schools were paid bonus at a flat rate of $150 each. This practice was approved by P.C. 2541, of November 11th, 1925, and re-affirmed for the fiscal year 1924-25 by P.C. 1036, dated June 21st, 1924. Copies of these Minutes are attached hereto.\n\nP.C. 1/718, dated May 6th, 1925, provided new ranges of compensation with a view to the discontinuance of the bonus. Section B of Section II of Civil Service Regulations re Bonus and Salary, approved by this last mentioned Order in Council, was considered authority for adding $150 to the salary of each teacher for the fiscal year 1925-26.\n\nI understand that Miscellaneous Vote No. 492 includes an item of $35,950 for salary adjustments in the Outside Service of Indian Affairs. Arrangements should now be made for a transfer from this Vote to Indian Education of the funds necessary to pay the increase in salaries of teachers of Indian day schools. The amount required is $35,031.25, as shown on the attached list.\n\nThe Treasury Board will give favourable consideration to our application provided it is approved by the Civil Service Commission. I wish to recommend that steps be taken to secure such approval.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMinister of Indian Education.\nOttawa, February 19, 1926.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPursuant to my recent conversation with Dr. Roche and Mr. Putman, I have now to request that you will arrange for a general change in the Classification of \"Teacher (Indian School)\". It is extremely desirable that the compensation read \"From $500 to $1800 for the academic year,\" the exact amount to be decided by the Department and the Civil Service Commission in each case.\"\n\nI should be grateful if you would secure approval to adjust as from April first, last, the salaries of teachers of Indian day schools, who, during the year 1924-25 were in receipt of special bonus. It is desired to add the amount of bonus paid during the said year to their salaries for 1925-26.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

I regret that I can find no authority in this connection.\n\nDuring the past twenty years there have been nine payments to teachers of Indian schools who have served this Department faithfully. These payments to this class of workers have not been questioned before as far as I can learn. Teachers have not been brought under superannuation, so, I presume, the only adequate authority for such payments would be a special vote of Parliament.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nGeorges Gonthier, Esq.,\nAuditor General,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Treasury Board, approved by His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the 23rd March, 1926.\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS.\n\nThe Board had under consideration the following memorandum from the Civil Service Commission, submitted by the Honourable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs:\n\n\"As provided in Sub-Section 1 of Section 45B of the Civil Service Act of 1918, as amended, the Civil Service Commission, on the recommendation of the Department of Indian Affairs, submits the following report for approval:\n\nTEACHER (INDIAN SCHOOL)\n\nThe compensation for this class which is at present:\n\nAnnual: $720 $780 $840 $900 $960 $1020 $1080\n\n(during the portion of the year school is in session).\n\nThe school year varies from 18 weeks to 52 weeks; the usual year, however, is from 39 to 45 weeks.

F. Hardyman, I have to report that he completed 30 years' service as a teacher in Indian schools on March 31, 1919, when he resigned his position at Garden River C. E. At that time, favourable consideration was given in his case and a retiring allowance equal to 6 months' salary was allowed, with the approval of the Superintendent General. The Auditor General has lately pointed out that retiring leave with pay must not exceed 60 days. At the time, there was no superannuation scheme in effect for any class of civil servants appointed after 1898. Mr. Hardyman, of course, could not come under the present superannuation scheme, for not only has he not been in our employ of late years, but teachers of Indian day schools are considered ineligible. I believe that the only adequate authority for the payment that was made or for a further payment would be a special Vote of Parliament.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nRURAL SCHOOL SALARIES.\n\nTo those not familiar with such matters, it will come almost incredible that teachers in the rural schools of the Ottawa region are paid a maximum \"salary\" of $200 a year, as just stated by Professor Cloutier of McGill at a meeting of lay teachers of Hull County on Wednesday. None is more essential to the school teacher than to do essential work; teachers have more directly to do parents' teaching the lives of the young people than any other person they come in contact with. The least that can be expected from that teacher who paid a living wage. The salary mentioned is not that it is a mere pittance and alone will not ensure a decent standard of living.\n\nHow do these responsible for such conditions expect young women to take up such a calling? The teaching profession under such circumstances is not a career but a martyrdom. And what of the children? Is it to be expected that they will receive the instruction they need to fit them for after-life work? Their teachers are offered such beggarly remuneration! It can only be assumed that these responsible look upon the education of children as an irksome subjection to the frivolous belief shared by members of most communities that schooling is the right of every young person.\n\nConditions, however, are not a great deal better in other parts of the country, for in Ontario and the West the salaries of rural teachers range from $400 to only $600 a year. One can only express admiration for the self-sacrifice of the teachers who are under these conditions and hope that any move to better their lot will be crowned with success.\n\nHawa Citizen\n\nJan 7, 1926\n\nE.W.

Your editorial in \"The Citizen\" of January 7th stated that in Ontario and the West, the salaries of rural teachers ranged from $400.00 to only $500.00 a year. I hope you will be able to correct the impression left by these figures, which should be nearly doubled to be in harmony with the facts.\n\nThe information in this writing has been secured from the latest \"Annual Survey of Education in Canada\", a publication of the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, Department of Trade and Commerce. The period covered in this publication is the academic year ended June 30, 1926, except in the case of Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba. The period for Quebec and Ontario is one year earlier and for Manitoba, the academic year ended June 30, 1925. Of course, my remarks concerning teachers and their classification referred to those in elementary schools only.\n\nThe Maritimes.\n\nIn Prince Edward Island, there are three classes of teachers and the average salary of all (male and female) in the lowest class was $405.00. In Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, there are five classes and the average salary of the lowest was $409.00 and $411.00 in these provinces respectively. It can be stated that the average salary for rural schools in the Maritimes would be higher than these figures indicate, for many better qualified teachers are employed in these schools and, in this present study, their salaries are not taken into account.\nQuebec.\n\nIn Quebec, there are three classes of teachers and the average salary of female lay teachers of the lowest class in Roman Catholic rural schools was $277.00. In Protestant schools, the average for this class of teacher was $356.00.\n\nOntario.\n\nThere are three classes of certificate in Ontario and the average salary of female teachers in rural Public Schools was $389.00. For Separate Schools this figure for the lowest grade of teachers is not available, but the average salary of all female teachers in Separate rural schools was $307.00.\n\nPrairie Provinces.\n\nIn these provinces, there are three classes of teachers, and in Manitoba, excluding consolidated schools where higher salaries are paid, there were 281 teachers (male and female) in rural schools receiving less, and 1542 receiving more, than $900.00. In Saskatchewan and Alberta, the average salary of the lowest class of teachers (male and female), in rural schools, was $1001.00 and $1002.00, respectively. I wish to point out here that, in Alberta, there are very few of the lowest class of teachers employed, so that the average salary of rural school teachers in this province would be much higher than the figure given.\n\nBritish Columbia.\n\nThe lowest individual salary paid to a teacher in rural and Assisted schools in British Columbia was $750.00 \u2014 the highest, $2550.00, and the average salary for the teachers of this class of schools was $1085.00. I might add here that the average salary of teachers in organized rural municipalities was $1509.00.\n\nI regret that the foregoing could not be placed in the form of a tabular statement so that a moment's attention would enable the cursory reader to grasp the significance of the figures. The different methods of the Provincial Statisticians make this impossible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.W. Harold, Esq.,\nThe Citizen,\nOttawa.\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSliammon Indian Reserve,\nPowell River, B.C.\nMay 6, 1926.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I bring to your attention some of the difficulties which teachers of day schools have to face under the present system of paying salaries. The school year begins on the first of September and in many cases my own included the salary for the month of September is not received until the end of October. The teacher does not receive another cheque until the end of January when the salary for December quarter arrives. He has therefore had to worry along for five months including the Christmas season on a months salary. Christmas when teachers like most people have additional outlays seen them without funds and a quarters salary due. The school term closed on the thirtieth of June and the salary for the June quarter was received until the end of July, while half of the vacation period has expired and the teacher is anxious to earn. If he wishes to do so from the reserve until receipt of the salary cheque. The present system compels the obtaining of long credit for which the teacher has to pay.\n\nCould something be done to have salaries paid monthly as in the case of other officials? Perhaps you would be kind enough to take the matter under advisement with a view to an improvement in the system.\n\nI hope you will the situation and that you will not take exception to me troubling you.\n\nI am sure other teachers as well as myself will be very grateful for your assistance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nTeacher,\nSliammon Day School.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. Of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Canada.\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, in which you suggest that the salaries of teachers of Indian day schools be paid monthly. In reply I beg to say that the Department has given very careful consideration to this question and, for different reasons, it has been found impossible to make any change in the present system of quarterly payments. I may say, however, that the Department is prepared to allow an advance on the quarterly salary on receipt of a request from the teacher. Such request should, of course, be forwarded through the office of the local Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Would you be good enough to advise me through whom he receives payment of his salary, and whether or not the same might be garnished?

English, Esq.,\nBarrister, Etc.,\nMorse, Sask.\nSIR:-\n\nI have been requested to bring to your attention the manner in which Day School Teachers' Salaries are paid, and to ask if it would not be possible to have them carried upon the monthly pay-list, instead of receiving their cheques quarterly in arrears upon submission of the usual School Report.\n\nAs these officials receive a fixed salary, which is not dependent upon the number of pupils shown upon the report, it would appear that it would be quite possible to do this and to remove the hardship under which they are at present suffering being so long between payments of salaries.\n\nI would recommend that if at all possible this change be brought into effect, as the present system undoubtedly is very awkward for the teachers, and does not appear to have any corresponding reason or advantage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.M.

Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nOttawa, March 9th, 1929.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nWith reference to the enclosed card, I beg to say that the Department has been unable to trace the name of Elizabeth MacKinnon, nee Johnson, who is stated to have been in our employ from April, 1920, to December, 1928. Please request her to state where she was employed and in what capacity. On receipt of this information, it may be possible to report definitely regarding her services.\n\nThe stamped envelope which you forwarded is returned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEnc. 2.\n\nThe J. L. Hudson Co.,\n1206 Woodward Avenue,\nDetroit, Mich.,\nU.S.A.\nJuly 9, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT,\n\nMrs. A. Beauvais, who has taught for the Department continuously from September, 1895, has been retired as from the 30th ultimo. It is desired to deal as generously as possible in her case.\n\nPrior to 1924, three teachers of Indian day schools, who had given long service, were superannuated under the Calder Act. The provisions of this Act are no longer effective. In addition, seven teachers were given from three to six months' retiring leave, and, as far as I am aware, these payments were not questioned.\n\nThe Superannuation Act of 1924 evidently changed the situation. You will remember that the Department decided it was not proper to admit our teachers to the privileges enjoyed by a permanent Civil Servant. This action was taken for good and sufficient reasons, which still obtain. In 1925, however, when we granted four months' retiring leave to Levi Dortater, the Auditor General wrote: \"Retiring leave with pay may be granted only by the Civil Service Commission and for a period not exceeding 60 days. I shall be obliged if you will let me know the authority under which this payment to Levi Dortater has been made.\" The Department replied in part: \"I regret that I can find no authority in this connection\". I believe the only adequate authority would have been a special vote.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1927, several teachers of Indian day schools, who had served the Department faithfully, received two months' retiring leave. These payments were not questioned. I now believe, however, that these payments of two months' gratuity from 1924 to 1927 were really without adequate authority. Section 75 of the Civil Service Regulations makes no provision for retiring leave in the case of those who have not been given permanent status.\n\nPursuant to an Order in Council in June, 1927, concerning superannuation regulations, I find that there was an additional Order passed on July 4th of that year (P.C. 5/1916). This gives authority for retiring leave to \"temporary employees who have been employed in permanent positions under departmental authority since prior to the 24th of May, 1918, but whose permanent status has never been confirmed\". The retiring leave mentioned is as provided by Section 75 of the Civil Service Regulations as extended by the Order in Council. Section 75 allows 2 months retiring\nleave, and, in the case of persons who are being retired under the provisions of the Superannuation and Retirement Act, 1906, or under the provisions of Section 5, Subsection a I and a II, of the C. S. S. A., 1927, retiring leave as follows:\n\n10 to 15 years continuously - 3 months.\n15 \" 20 \" \" - 4 \"\n20 \" 25 \" \" - 5 \"\n25 years or over \" - 6 \"\n\nI believe it is quite in order, under authority of this Order in Council, to give retiring leave of from one to six months to teachers of Indian day schools who have been in our employ prior to May 24, 1918. With your concurrence, I propose to allow Mrs. Beaupre six months' gratuity.\n\nIn the case of those teachers who were not employed before May 24, 1918, but who now or in the future have given 5, 10 or 15 years' service, there appears to be no authority for even 2 months' retiring leave, but, as we have always granted such without official criticism from any source, I think we can safely continue the practice for worthy teachers.\n\nRussell T.

I find that Section 65 of the Civil Service Regulations indicates that permanent and temporary employees are subject to the same regulations in this matter. Sick leave is at the rate of 1/2 days per month of continuous service and is cumulative.\n\nThe undetermined status of \"Teacher - Indian Day School\", of course, makes it impossible for the Civil Service Commission or the Auditor General to rule in the matter, but it is understood that the Deputy Minister may give this leave, up to six months, in any fiscal year, on the production of satisfactory evidence of disability (Sec. 67).\nGarden River\nWater - 3rd class\n9/13 - 2 yrs high sch.

As this information is always given in the \"Blue Book\" of Toronto Education Department about Ontario schools, I feel that this is not \"forbidden information.\"\n\nCould you give me this information about the schools in Garden River Agency (5 teachers):\n\nGore Bay Agency (3 teachers): Fort William agency (4 teachers): Walpole Island Agency School No. 1 Mr. J.W. Daly, Mrs. J.W. Daly.\n\nThe above schools are all in Ontario.\n\nFurthermore, you may be too greatly concerned.\n\nYours very truly yours,\n\nMiss L. Harrison\nP.O. Box 531, Midland, Ont.\nOttawa, March 15th, 1932.\n\nDear Madam,\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to qualifications and salaries of the teachers in certain Ontario Indian day schools.\n\nThe information regarding qualifications is not contained in any of our printed reports but, if there is any special reason why you require the details, I shall be glad to give your request consideration. As you may be aware, Indian schools do not come under the provincial departments. They are controlled solely by this Department. In nearly every case, they were started many years ago by one or other of the missionary societies or orders who are associated with us in Indian work. Some of the teachers have no professional certificates but have a special training in institutions conducted by their orders or societies and have long experience in our work.\n\nWith reference to salaries, they vary from $800 to $1,000 for the ten teaching months.\n\nIf the Department can be of any further help, please let me know.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss S. Harrison,\nBox 531,\nMidland, Ont.\nOttawa, April 1st, 1932.\n\nTo Teachers of Indian Day Schools:\n\nOwing to the decrease in the Appropriation to be voted for Indian Education, the Department regrets that, for the current fiscal year, it will be necessary to reduce by 10% the salaries of all teachers of Indian day schools.\n\nThis reduction will be effective from today's date and will result in a decrease in the June quarter payments.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 1, 1932, file No. 1-1-3, with reference to the 10% reduction of the salaries of all teachers of Indian day schools as from April 1st.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. S. Ryckman,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nApril 5, 1932.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRe: PER CAPITA GRANTS AT Indian Residential Schools.\n\nThere was a quickening of interest in the education of the Indians of Canada in the eighties, and, in 1892, the Government had to give serious consideration to a system of financing the residential schools. The number of boarding and industrial schools had become greatly increased, particularly in western Canada. Order in Council of October 22, 1892, authorized the per capita grant method of financing the industrial schools. For some time, grants had been given to boarding schools. At this time, the grants varied from $60 to $145, the average grant for the next 20 years being $86.00.\n\nIn 1911, in answer to the pressure from the Churches for larger grants for the boarding schools, there was prepared a schedule by geographical divisions and types of buildings, and a formal agreement was made between the Department and the management of the boarding schools. This was in effect from April first, 1911, to April first, 1916. The average grant, including that paid to industrial schools for this period, was $115.00.\n\nIn 1919, there was a bonus or a flat increase of $10 in the rate and in 1921, an additional $10 - a total bonus of $20, making the average grant for all schools $135.00. In 1924, this bonus was incorporated in the regular scale of grants.\n\nPursuant to a church delegation in January, 1926, there was an upward revision and an effort to deal more fairly with the rural school, the one remote from markets and the institution where farming and other facilities were poor. This revision was continued for five years, and, last year (1931), the average per capita grant paid to Indian residential schools in Canada amounted to $172.00.\n\nIt might be noted that, when the largest increases were made in the per capita grants, it was at a time of inflation and prosperity (1911, 1920 and 1926). During the present period of depression, it has been found necessary, in the interests of economy, to make a flat decrease in the per capita grants, of 10%, which will make the average $155. However, the dollar today purchases more than it has done any time since the War, so there should be no real hardship. Of course, any lowering of the grants means poorer food, and clothing and less efficient academic and vocational and academic training. It will also have effect on minor repairs and painting to our buildings.\n\n(Sgd.) Russell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nPROVIDENCE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nFORT PROVIDENCE, N.W.T.\nJune 6th, 1932\n\nMR. RUSSELL T. FERRIER, Superintendent of Indian Education\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOTTAWA\n\nDear and kind Sir:-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter dated March 29th, 1932,\nNo. 1-1-3, informing me that owing to the reduction in the Appropri-\nation to be voted for Indian Education, it has been necessary to reduce\nby 10% all per capita grant payments made to Indian residential schools\nduring the fiscal year 1932-33, also of the letter (circular), No. 150-14,\ndated May 11th, 1922, with respect to discharges of pupils from Indian\nresidential schools.\n\nYou may trust that, as much as possible, your\nrecommendations will be faithfully observed.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nSister Sartain\nPrincipal\nJune 16th, 1932.\n\nMR. PHILAN:\n\nIt would be a distinct advantage under the present accounting system if vouchers for teachers' salaries were sent in to the Treasury Branch in groups. Vouchers for per capita allowances could also be sent in groups; each group clipped together in each case.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Harris\nJune 20, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. WILLIAMS,\n\nFrank J. Joblin, at present teacher of the Christian Island Indian Day School, is retiring from our service, after teaching continuously at the Almshouse, Morriston and Gibbon Indian Day Schools from September 1, 1905, to October 27, 1927, a continuous service of over 22 years; and then, after a break of three years, at the Christian Island Indian Day School from September 1, 1930, to June 30, 1932. I wish to recommend retiring leave equivalent to 5 months' salary because of his 22 years of continuous service, which ended in 1927 but which was not paid at that time because he was not finally leaving our employ. Such retiring leave is provided by Section 73 of the Civil Service Regulations, as extended to temporary employees who have been employed since prior to the 24th of May, 1918, by P. C. 5/1516, of July 4, 1927. You will note that this Order in Council had been passed prior to his leaving our service, temporarily, in October of that year.\n\nAs 5 years have elapsed, I believe it advisable to secure an Order in Council, authorizing the payment. On the 30th instant, Mr. Joblin is finally leaving our service.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n| Agency          | Teacher | Cleaner | Helper | Principal Officer |\n|-----------------|---------|---------|--------|-------------------|\n| P.E.S.          |         |         |        |                   |\n| Antigonish      | 1       |         |        |                   |\n| Cape Breton     | 2       | 2       | 2      |                   |\n| Colchester      | 1       |         |        |                   |\n| Digby           | 1       |         |        |                   |\n| Inverness       | 2       | 2       |        |                   |\n| Picton          | 1       |         |        |                   |\n| Richmond        | 1       |         |        |                   |\n| Victoria        | 1       |         |        |                   |\n| N.B.

I refer particularly in this regard to the following:\n\nTransport Reqn. No. 1988 - from Regina\nfor Norway House - $5.48\n\" \" \" 1989 - from Regina\nfor Norway House - 92.19\n\" \" \" 1994 - from Regina\nfor Blackfoot - 9.73\n\" \" \" 1995 - from Regina\nfor Blackfoot - 9.59\n\" \" \" 1996 - from Regina\nfor Blood - 11.03\n\" \" \" 1997 - from Regina\nfor Blood - 9.24\n\" \" \" 1998 - from Regina\nfor Peigan - 10.29\n\" \" \" 1999 - from Regina\nfor Peigan - 9.11\n\" \" \" 2000 - from Regina\nfor Hobbs - 11.78\n\" \" \" 2001 - from Regina\nfor Story - 11.99\n\" \" \" 1986 - from Regina\nfor Clandeboye - 88.85\n\nIt appears from the requisitions mentioned that the amounts quoted above should be paid from the Appropriation for Indian Education. If the supplies covered by these requisitions were being furnished free of cost to Indian residential schools, it is considered that the transportation costs, at least, should have been paid by the schools receiving the supplies. Please let me have full details regarding each of the shipments covered by the above requisitions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department letter No. 1-1-3, dated the 26th ultimo, with reference to an account received from the Canadian Pacific Railway Company covering freight and express charges on supplies sent to Indian Residential Schools in Manitoba and Alberta. Requisitions Nos. 1986, 1989, and 1986 cover the regular contract supplies of biscuits, beans, and tea for the Day Schools in the Clandebaye and Norway House Agencies. Requisitions Nos. 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001 cover charges on clothing and dry goods from the supplies taken over from the S. C. R. and in stock in the Warehouse here. I may say that when in Ottawa, the Minister gave instructions that the army supplies in the Warehouse here were to be distributed throughout the three Provinces according to the need for them. Upon our return from Ottawa I handed over the inventory of clothing to Inspectors Christianson and Hamilton. They made a selection and furnished me with lists setting out the articles and points to which shipment was to be made. I received no instructions regarding the manner in which payment of freight charges were to be made so simply followed the procedure in use before I took over this office. Requisition No. 1994 covers charges on supplies for the Old Sun's School; 1995 - Crowfoot School; 1996 - St. Paul's School; 1997 - St. Mary's School; 1998 - Sacred Heart Res. School; 1999 - St. Cyprian Res. School; 2000 - Ermineskin's School; and 2001 - Morley Res. School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

This new system will commence at the end of the present month.\n\nThe salaries of the teachers of the Indian Day Schools mentioned on the attached list have in the past been forwarded to the Treasurer of the United Church of Canada. This new procedure will involve issuing a separate cheque to each teacher and forwarding the same from here to the teacher's address. The Regulations now require that all salary cheques should be paid direct to the teacher concerned, unless Power of Attorney has been received from the teacher, authorising payment to some other party.\n\nAs the present system of issuing cheques to the United Church Missionary Society has been in operation for so many years, the Department did not wish to make any change without advising you. I trust that your Society will have no objection to the new procedure, which is being adopted for the sole reason of facilitating our work.\n\nYou will note that I am not including on the enclosed list the seasonal schools. Payment of the amount due for teaching services at this class of schools, conducted under the auspices of the United Church, will be paid in the future, as in the past, to your Treasurer. Possibly, there are one or two schools on the attached list, for which you would also prefer having the cheques issued to your Treasurer; and, if so, you should advise me, and the Department will comply with your wishes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Department did not wish to make any change in this procedure without advising you.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Consequently, they are not being placed on the Monthly Paylist. The salaries of the teachers at these schools can be paid quarterly as in the past on receipt of the quarterly returns.\n\nList 2 gives the names of the Seasonal Schools. These are usually in operation from June to September, inclusive. It is advisable to place them on the regular monthly paylist.\n\nList 3 gives the names of the Combined White and Indian Day Schools at which the Department of Indian Affairs pays part of the teacher's salary. As we are not always certain that these are in operation until the quarterly returns have been received, the teachers of these schools have not been placed on the Monthly Paylist. Cheques for them can be issued quarterly on receipt of the quarterly returns.\n\n[Signature]\n| Province       | School                  | Teacher               | Salary |\n|---------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------|\n| Quebec        | Fort George             | Miss B.

Rev. A. D. DEWDNEY, D.D.\nBishop.\n\nP. O. BOX 422,\nKENORA, ONT.\n\nApril 23rd, 1934.\n\nMy dear Mr. Sutherland,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th inst., re direct payment of Salaries of teachers in Indian Day schools and that monthly.\n\nWhere the Department's grant constitutes the entire salary of the teacher as in the case of the teacher at the Jack River School, the teacher will no doubt, welcome the change and it will not affect the Church one way or other, as in the case of Anglican Missions the Bishop will continue in the case of vacancies to make the nomination of a suitable person to the Department.\n\nIn the case of schools, such as Split Lake and Hollowwater River, the change will somewhat complicate the payment of salaries due the teachers since they receive stipend at a specific rate from our headquarters of which the salary given by the Department forms a part, they could of course give me the power of attorney and direct payment to be made as formerly. If the method you advise becomes operative at the end of this month cheques from your office would hardly reach either teacher as the spring break-up is due and mails will be interrupted for at least a month.\n\nOne advantage of the former method of paying through the Church authorities is the fact that the payments of the department in support of Indian Education in the Day Schools of the Missions are published in the annual financial statements of the Church and credit is thus given the Indian Department of the Dominion Government for the valuable help thus given.\n\nKindly let me know the course you finally decide upon and keep me informed as to your payments if made direct so that I may adjust our payments accordingly.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.D. Sutherland, Esq.\nActing Supt. Ind. Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\nCOPY\n\nBOARD OF HOME MISSIONS\n\nThe United Church of Canada\n\nToronto, April 24, 1934\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nRe Method of Payment - Salaries of Day School Teachers.\n\nI did not reply immediately to your communication of April 9th concerning this matter, because I wanted to discuss it with the Indian and Oriental Committee of the Board of Home Mission, which held a long session in connection with our recent annual meeting.\n\nRightly or wrongly, there is a growing feeling on the part of our missionaries and their representatives on the Board that the Government plans to take away from the Missionary Societies of the Churches the right to nominate teachers for Indian Day Schools. This feeling is very pronounced and exceedingly vocal over our whole British Columbia Conference. We had before us a very strong resolution which was passed by the British Columbia Conference last May. After due consideration, the Committee recommended a resolution which is copied herewith, and it was unanimously adopted by the Board:\n\n\"That we reaffirm our conviction that it is in the interests of both the educational and missionary work on Indian Missions that the Church should retain the right to nominate teachers for Indian Day Schools, and that the Secretaries be asked to call a Conference with other Churches engaged in Indian work, with a view to making representations to the Department of Indian Affairs asking for assurance that no infringement of this right is contemplated.\"\n\n\"We further recommend that the teachers nominated should possess the following qualifications:\n\n1) Must be missionary minded.\n2) Must have adequate professional qualifications.\n3) Must be old enough to appreciate the problems involved in living on an Indian reserve.\"\n(4) Must be able to work harmoniously with others.\n(5) Must, preferably, be members of the United Church of Canada.\"\n\nThere are some difficulties, so far as our method of administration is concerned, in acceding to the request of the Department. The fact that you have decided to pay day school teachers monthly will be no advantage to our teachers, because it has been our custom to pay them nothing no matter how long we had to wait for the Department's cheques. It is out of our hands entirely the determination of the salary which is to be paid. For example, when I raised with you a year ago the question of the salary of Miss Frances Patterson, who was being appointed to Port Simpson, I was told that it was impossible for the Government to increase it because of a certain Order in Council. By re-arranging salaries at two or three places in British Columbia, we were able to pay Miss Patterson on a basis commensurate with her experience and teaching ability. That she has already completely transformed the Port Simpson school is proof of the wisdom of her appointment.\n\nIn addition, a good many of the teachers in the list which you enclosed are missionary-teachers. For some strange reason, which I have never been able to understand, the Department of Indian Affairs discriminates against a missionary-teacher in the setting of his salary - no matter how well qualified he may be otherwise. In spite of the fact that in the last four years we have changed the status and qualifications of more than two-thirds of our teachers, and in spite of the fact that these missionary-teachers today are either experienced teachers in middle life or university graduates with technical educational training, the Department still continues to set the salaries on a lower scale, and the Board of Home Missions has to give a very considerable additional amount in most cases, in order to obtain their services.\n\nIf it is merely a matter of getting a statement from each of our teachers that they prefer to be paid through this office, that will be comparatively easy to obtain. If the Treasury Board insists that the cheques must be made out henceforth in the name of the individual, then I do not see why our office should not be the post office address of these teachers, and we could add the additional amount which we find it necessary to pay them in order to secure workers of their calibre.\n\nI hope to be in Ottawa on Thursday and will be glad to discuss this matter with you at length. We have no desire to be obstinate, but the situation so far as we are concerned is decidedly awkward.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton.\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nWould you please send me the extra copy of the file I sent you last week?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nN.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Method of Payment - Salaries of Day School Teachers.\n\nI did not reply immediately to your communication of April 9th concerning this matter, because I wanted to discuss it with the Indian and Oriental Committee of the Board of Home Missions, which held a long session in connection with our recent annual meeting.\n\nRightly or wrongly, there is a growing feeling on the part of our missionaries and their representatives on the Board that the Government plans to take away from the Missionary Societies of the Churches the right to nominate teachers for Indian Day Schools.

Beaton, Secretary, Board of Home Missions of The United Church of Canada.\n\nIn his letter Mr. Beaton submits two objections to Departmental policy:\n\nFirst. He insists very strongly, as you will note upon the alleged right of the various Church organizations to nominate teachers for Indian Day Schools. In the appointment of Day School teachers the Department has been guided very largely by nominations made by the Church missionary organizations. However, this has always been conceded rather a privilege than a right.\n\nSecond. Reverend Mr. Beaton objects to the various Day School teachers employed by the Department being paid directly by cheques through the Comptroller of the Treasury Department. The practice has been in the past to make a cheque in favour of the missionary society in payment of all the teachers affiliated with that particular body. With this practice which Mr. Beaton wishes to continue, I am entirely in disagreement and feel that the position taken by the Comptroller of the Treasury, that cheques should be sent to individual teachers, is perfectly sound and one that should be adhered to.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMay 8th, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nI have given careful consideration to your letter of the 26th ultimo, and it has been decided to forward the salaries of teachers of Indian Day Schools direct. As you were previously informed, all salaries will be paid monthly in future.\n\nAs I intimated to you when you were in my office recently, the question of the method of appointment of teachers is the subject of correspondence between this Department and the Civil Service Commission. A definite decision in this regard has not yet been reached.\n\nI have noted particularly the paragraph in your letter in which you complain of a discrimination against missionary teachers in the matter of salary. I agree with you that the salaries of qualified missionary teachers should not be on a lower scale. Unfortunately, present conditions and regulations do not permit the Department to make any re-adjustment in salaries. The matter, however, will be kept in mind, and as soon as financial conditions warrant, the necessary adjustments will be made in the salaries of this class of teachers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

As previously I have received my salary from the United Church of Canada. I have assumed that this cheque was sent to me by mistake and I am returning it to you.\n\nIf there has been a change in the way my salary is to be paid please notify me.\n\nI have already received cheques from the United Church for my April and May salaries.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. T. Denny\nMissionary-Lector\nOttawa, June 19th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 1st instant, together with cheque for $95.00 being your salary for the month of April 1934.\n\nI note that your salary heretofore was paid direct to you by the United Church of Canada, but I would advise you that commencing with April of this year the policy of this Department with regard to the payment of teachers' salaries has been changed and these salaries are to be paid direct by the Department to the respective teachers each month.\n\nThe authorities of the United Church of Canada were advised to this effect some two months ago and, therefore, if you receive any further salary cheques from them, you should take the question up with that organization and retain the cheque sent you by this Department.\n\nI am returning your April salary cheque to the Assistant Secretary of the Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, in view of the fact that you retained the cheque which they sent you covering your salary for April.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN.J. Allen\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nRobt. F. Davey, Esq.,\nHartley Bay,\nB.C.\nBANK RECEIPT No. 3033\n\nAmt. $95.00\n\nDate: June 15, 1934\n\nEntered Journal No.\n\nFolio\n\nDept. Receipt No.\nOttawa, June 19th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose herewith cheque for $95.00 being the salary for the month of April for Mr. Robt. F. Davey, Hartley Bay, B.C.\n\nUnder date of 1st instant, this gentleman returned his April salary cheque saying that he had received salary for that month from the United Church of Canada.\n\nI understand that you were advised about two months ago of the change in policy regarding the payment of day school teachers' salaries and it is presumed you advised the teachers involved.\n\nI have advised Mr. Davey that, since he retained the April salary cheque which you sent him, we are returning through you a cheque to replace the original cheque issued by this Department which he returned to us, and in future he should not return any salary cheques issued to him by this Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN.C. Allen\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St., W.,\nToronto, 2, Ontario.\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\nDiocese of Yukon\nCanada\n\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\n23rd June 1934.\n\nMr. A. F. McKenzie,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. McKenzie:\n\nI understand that a change has been made by your Department in the manner of paying the salaries to the teachers for our Day Schools at Selkirk and Moosehide.\n\nFormerly a cheque was sent each quarter to the Diocese but I understand the arrangement now is that at the end of each month a cheque is sent to the teacher at these two places. I am writing to ask if it would be possible to have the cheque made out to the Diocese as formerly. The Missionaries at those two points, who are also the teachers of the day schools, receive a salary considerably larger than that provided by the Dept., and this salary is guaranteed to them irrespective of whether the Dept. makes any payment or not, and it would be much easier for us if the cheques could be made out to the Diocese. If, however, the Dept. feels the proper procedure to be that of sending the cheque direct to the individual teacher we shall, of course, be quite satisfied to have that method carried out.\n\nWith regard to the day schools at Carmacks, Champagne and Teslin, is it your intention to follow a similar procedure here?\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you regarding this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Yukon.\nOttawa, July 9, 1934.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to Your Lordship's letter of the 23rd ultimo, it is regretted that you were not previously advised regarding the monthly payment of the salaries of the teachers of the Selkirk and Moosehide Indian Day Schools.\n\nPresent regulations require that salaries of teachers of Indian day schools that are in regular operation should be paid direct to the teachers, and since April of this year salaries are being paid monthly. In view of the regulations mentioned, the Department desires to continue monthly payment of salaries to the teachers of the Selkirk and Moosehide Schools.\n\nThe amounts due for the seasonal schools which have been authorized will be paid in the same manner as in the past, viz., the cheques will be issued in favour of the Diocese of Yukon and sent to the Financial Secretary, Mr. A. Goldrick, Dawson, Yukon.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRight Rev. W. A. Geddes,\nBishop of Yukon,\nWhitehorse, Y.T.\nOffice of the Auditor General\n\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, Dec. 26th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe following September quarter returns of the residential schools appear to contain the following errors:\n\n- **Birtle:** Page 1 adds to 2305 instead of 2306 resulting in an overpayment of 36 cents.\n- **Cowessess:** Average attendance should be 78.17 instead of 78.16. Underpayment of 36 cents.\n- **Thunderchild:** Page 5 adds to 10039; average attendance is therefore 109.11. Underpayment of $7.23.\n- **St. Paul's Hostel:** Average attendance should be 18.13. Overpaid 53 cents.\n- **Alert Bay:** Page 6 adds to 14046 instead of 13956 resulting in an underpayment of $37.49.\n- **Port Simpson:** The payment would appear to be $992.53 instead of $966.85. Underpaid $25.67.\n- **St. Mary's:** Page 1 adds to 2139 instead of 2158. No overpayments however as per capita at 125 only.\n- **Fort Resolution:** Adds to 5718 instead of 3717. Apparently underpaid $924.38.\n\nIt would appear that many of these errors in the first instance were made by the school authorities resulting in a loss of revenue to themselves. I would suggest that you impress on them the desirability of correct returns from their standpoint as well as from that of the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.D. Sutherland, Esq.,\nActing Superintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Department.\n\nEnc. 9\nOttawa, January 3, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to certain errors in the September quarter returns of certain Indian residential schools.\n\nThe underpayment of $924.35 to the Fort Resolution Indian Residential School is being rectified at once by issuing a supplementary voucher.\n\nThe mistakes made in the case of the Birtle, Cowessess, Thunderchild, St. Paul's Hostel, Alert Bay and Port Simpson Indian Residential Schools will be rectified when we are issuing the vouchers for the quarter ended December 31st, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nG. J. Allan, Esq.,\nAuditor General's Department,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 5, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that His Lordship the Bishop of Caledonia has nominated the services of Mr. W. Thorman as teacher of the summer school which it is proposed to open during the coming summer for the benefit of the Indian children at Tahltan. The appointment of Mr. Thorman is approved, with salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month. It is understood that this school will be opened as early as possible in May next, and will continue for a period of approximately five months.\n\nThe Department understands that suitable classroom accommodation will be provided by the church authorities. The classroom supplies considered necessary will be forwarded in due time.\n\nI would request that you give Mr. Thorman every possible assistance in his work and in encouraging a regular attendance of the Indian children of school age.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nHarper Reed, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTelegraph Creek,\nB. C.\n\nSee Memo to Minister's Office, dated Dec. 26, 1934, approved; and received by Dept.

McGUIIL.\n\nThe Indian day schools close for the Easter holidays on the 15th instant and reopen on April 29th.\n\nAs many of our teachers will wish to go home for the Easter holidays, I would appreciate your concurrence in requesting the Representative of the Treasury to issue salary cheques for teachers of Indian day schools in order that these cheques may reach the respective teachers by the 15th instant.\n\nAPPROVED:\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\n## SUMMARIZED STATEMENT SHOWING PER CAPITA GRANTS, RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS,\nFOR FISCAL YEARS INDICATED\n\n| SCHOOL | 1916-16 | 1926-27 | 1931-32 | 1932-33 | Basic Rate | Less 10% on Basic Rate |\n|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|------------|------------------------|\n|        |         |         |         |         |            |                        |\n| Nova Scotia: |         |         |         |         |            |                        |\n| Shubenacadie (R.C.) | - | - | $180 p.c. | $180. | $162 p.c. | $153 p.c. | $162 p.c. |\n| Quebec: |         |         |         |         |            |                        |\n| Fort George (C.E.) | - | - | - | - | 170. | 180. |\n| Ontario: |         |         |         |         |            |                        |\n| Albany (C.E.) | $125 p.c. | $165 p.c. | 200 p.c. | 200. | 180 p.c. | 170. | 180. |\n| Cecilia Jeffrey (Presby.) | 125 | 140 | 165 | 165 | 149 | 140 | 149 |\n| Chapleau (C.E.) | 80 | 140 | 160 | 160 | 144 | 136 | 144 |\n| Fort Frances (R.C.) | 100 | 140 | 160 | 160 | 149 | 140 | 149 |\n| Ft.

Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, I beg to say that the cheque for $14,395.79 recently forwarded to your Treasurer was in payment of the per capita allowance for the quarter ended March 31, 1935, for the following Indian residential schools:\n\n- Brandon .......... $3,411.25\n- Norway House .... 1,636.61\n- Edmonton ........ 2,994.89\n- Morley ........... 1,398.75\n- Coqualeetsa ...... 5,751.89\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, July 13th, 1935.\n\nTo Inspectors of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Agents, Church Officers\nand Principals of Indian\nResidential Schools:\n\nI wish to refer to circular letter dated\nApril 15th, 1935, informing you of a restoration of 5%\nin the per capita allowance to Indian Residential\nSchools during the fiscal year 1935-36. I am now\npleased to inform you that the Supplementary Estimates\nfor the current fiscal year have provided a restoration\nof a further 5% in the per capita allowances. This will\nmake a total restoration in the per capita allowances of\n10%, dating from the first of January, 1935.\n\nPayment for the quarter ended March 31st,\nlast, of the 5% provided by the Supplementary Estimates,\nwill be included in the cheques issued in payment of the\ngrant for the quarter ended June 30th.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nC. 160-1-2.\nSir,\n\nRecently some of our teachers in the Day Schools have requested to know if it could be arranged for them to receive their salary cheque at the end of each month instead of quarterly. They have pointed out it makes it difficult for them to carry on when they have to wait until after the quarterly return is sent in at the end of each quarter.\n\nThis matter has not come up before and I was not able to advise them but I am aware the Department's only knowledge of the attendance of the teacher is through the quarterly returns, and I presume this is the reason that their salaries are paid on receipt of these returns.\n\nIf the Department felt the salaries of the Day School teachers could be forwarded monthly, I would undertake to advise you of any necessary deductions as I am in regular touch with the schools.\n\nWould you kindly advise me whether this could be so arranged.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, October 12, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, with reference to payment of the salaries of the day school teachers in your agency.\n\nIn this connection I may say that, for some time past, the salaries of the teachers of the Alert Bay and the Cape Mudge Day Schools have been paid monthly.\n\nWith reference to Kingcome Inlet, Mamalilikulla, and Smith's Inlet Day Schools, the Department is not certain that these schools are regularly conducted. As a result, if cheques were issued monthly and it was later found that the school had not been open, a refund would have to be made, and this would cause a great deal of unnecessary inconvenience to all parties concerned, owing to the present regulations of the Treasury Board. For this reason, the Department has not issued the salary cheques for these teachers until the returns were received showing whether or not the schools had been open. If you can guarantee that any or all of these schools are in regular operation and that there will be no occasion for refunds, the Department is prepared to add them to the regular monthly pay list.\n\nIn the case of the Quatsino and Campbell River Schools, the Department is prepared to place them, also, on the monthly plan of payment, if you can assure us that these schools will be in continuous operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nALERT BAY, B. C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nOctober 26, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No. 1-1-3 dated October 12th, in reference to the operation of Day Schools in this Agency, I have to advise as follows:\n\nThe Alert Bay and Cape Mudge Day Schools are long-established schools which open and close on the regulation dates and I am pleased that the Department sends monthly cheques to these teachers.\n\nThe Kingcome Inlet School is now operated for the regulation term, and although the teacher has not made a request to be paid monthly, nevertheless the school is in constant operation and no doubt this would be appreciated.\n\nThe two new schools established this year, the Quatsino and Campbell River Day Schools, will have continuous operation, the former having opened on September 3rd and we hope the latter will start on November 1st. We would request the Department that the teachers of these schools be paid monthly, as we have already had a request from the teacher of the Quatsino Day School to this effect.\n\nWhile the Mamalilikulla Day School has not as long a term as the other schools, yet it is continuous once it starts, which is usually in November. If the Department could pay the teacher monthly we would undertake to advise the opening and closing date of this school, which is usually not in accordance with the regulation dates.\n\nUnder existing conditions, I think the present arrangements for the Smith Inlet School are satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, November 5th, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th ultimo, I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation, the Kingcome Inlet and Quatsino Indian Day Schools will be placed on the paylist and the salaries of the teachers will be paid monthly beginning with the month of November.\n\nAs soon as you inform me regarding the exact date on which the teacher of the Campbell River Indian Day School begins duties, her name will also be placed on the monthly paylist.\n\nThe paylist has to be prepared early in the month. For instance, officers of the Schools Branch have to give authority about the 7th of November in order to have the name of a teacher included on the November paylist. It is, therefore, necessary for us to know definitely early in the month whether or not any school will be in operation for that month. From the information contained in your letter, it is doubtful if you can give us such assurance regarding the Mamillilhilla Indian Day School and, consequently, the Department is not prepared to place this school on the regular monthly paylist. I feel that it would be preferable to only put this teacher when returns are received. By this method, all chances of making a mistake will be avoided. The same applies to the Smith's Inlet School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nPP/O'M.\nP.

I wish however to direct your attention to the fact that no September returns have been received for the following schools: Grouard, Joussard, Sturgeon Lake, Vermilion, Wabasca, Aklavik C.E. & R.C.\n\nYour attention is also directed to the fact that there appears to be an error in the Sioux Lookout return which causes an overpayment of $2.35.\n\nI would also be pleased to learn whether Orders in Council are being obtained for the new schools at Alberni, Old Crow Village, and Dease Lake.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.

Schools, have not yet been received. The Church authorities have been written and requested to expedite the forwarding of these returns.\n\nIt was found that there was an overpayment of $2.35 in connection with the September quarter of the per capita allowance for the Sioux Lookout School and this amount will be deducted when paying the December quarter per capita allowance.\n\nArrangements are being made to secure Orders-in-Council for the establishment of the Alberni, Old Crow Village and Dease Lake Schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWe have been consulting the Auditor General's Report to see what the trend has been in the salaries of Indian day school teachers in recent years, and have run into a difficulty.\n\nIn the last couple of years most of the salaries are indicated as for ten months, whereas back in 1930 they were mainly for nine months, and in 1926 mainly for twelve months. The significance of this different number of months in different years puzzles us. We wonder if it just means that the annual salary in some years was paid in ten instalments, while in others it was paid in nine or twelve instalments. Our particular concern is whether the stated salary, regardless of the number of months involved, represents the amount earned in a year.\n\nIf you could help us out on this point we would appreciate it. It would help us in a calculation we are making on the trend of earnings in the teaching profession as a whole.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEDUCATION BRANCH.\n\nMB\n## Comparative Statement of Salaries of Teachers of Indian Day Schools\n\n| Teachers | 1925-1926 | 1936-1937 |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| P.

It would appear that the average attendance of pupils during the December quarter works out at 122.35 instead of 122.25 as listed. Is there an underpayment of $3.92? Yes\n\nBlood R.C. return. Please inform me how the figure 12880 days was arrived at.\n\nSt. Martin's Wabasca Residential School. The average attendance during the September quarter was 101.78 and during the December quarter 92.73. However the figure is raised to 109.4 in September and 101.21 in December with the notation \"To Balance 5 Schools\". Please give me further information regarding this matter.\n\nI enclose herewith the four returns mentioned above and I am returning under separate cover the other returns. I also wish to point out that I have not received returns for Hay River. (Closed)\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. J. Allan,\nChief Examiner,\n\"C\" Branch.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nMarch 24, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant regarding certain returns for the quarters ending September 1 and December 31, 1937 I trust the following explanations will be satisfactory:\n\n1. Sioux Lookout Residential School\n\nOn checking this return it is found that a mistake was made in computing the amount of the grant and the underpayment of $3.92 will be allowed when paying the March quarter grant.\n\n2. Blood Residential School\n\nThe aggregate attendance as shown by this return for the quarter ended December 31, 1937 was 13,266 days. This was more than the authorized pupilage which is 140 pupils. 140 pupils at 92 days gives an aggregate attendance of 12,880 days. Deducting the period taken for Christmas holidays; namely, 375 days, left a balance of 12,505 days and gives an average attendance of 135.92 for which grant should have been allowed. The grant due on the basis of average attendance of 135.92 would be $5,326.36.\n\nHowever, at the time the grant was actually paid a mistake was made in computing the aggregate attendance. You will note that in the pencil entry on the return 140 x 92 is shown as 12,600 which is incorrect.\n\nThe average was computed on this incorrect aggregate and as a result the school was only paid $5,207.23. There is a balance due of $119.13 which will be allowed on the March quarter grant.\n\nG. J. Allan, Esq.,\nChief Examiner, 46th Branch,\nOffice of the Auditor General,\nOttawa, Ont.\n3. With reference to the payment made to the Wabasca R. C. Residential School a statement was recently supplied to Mr. Crowley. The total authorized pupilage at the 5 schools; namely, Grouard, Joussard, Wabasca, Vermilion and Sturgeon Lake is 475. With the approval of the Director it was decided some time ago to allow the full pupilage at the 5 schools provided the average attendance as shown on the returns warranted this procedure. The increased number allowed at Wabasca should really have been allowed at some other school which showed a higher average but the total grant allowed the 5 schools for the September quarter did not exceed 475 and, therefore, no overpayment was made for this quarter.\n\nI find, however, that an overpayment was made for the December quarter. The following is a brief statement:\n\n|                | AVERAGE SHOWN BY RETURN | PAID AT |\n|----------------|-------------------------|--------|\n| Sturgeon Lake  | 87.85                   | 87.85  |\n| Joussard       | 118.51                  | 118.51 |\n| Grouard        | 101.04                  | 101.04 |\n| Wabasca        | 92.73                   | 101.21 |\n| Vermilion      | 66.36                   | 66.36  |\n| **Total**      | **466.52**              | **475**|\n\nIn this particular quarter we should only have allowed for the total average at the 5 schools; namely, 466.52. There was an overpayment made of $8.45 at the Wabasca R. C. School and this amounts to $400.52 ($8.45 x $45.00 equals $421.60 less 5%). This amount will be deducted when paying the March quarter return.\n4. The Hay River Residential School was closed on September 1, 1937 and the pupilage allowed there; namely, 15 was transferred to the Aklavik C. E. Residential School where a pupilage of 50 has been authorized since October 1, 1937.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nExpenditure\nChurch-owned Residential Schools\n\nWe wish to bring to your attention the fact that three Purchase Orders which were not paid out of 1937-38 funds must now be paid from 1938-39 funds. These are as follows:\n\nP.O.No. 2535, Ermineskin Res. School - $162.50\nP.O.No. 3296, Spanish Res. School - $35.00\nP.O.No. 3596, \" \" \" \" - $20.90\n\nThese Purchase Orders have been charged against the amount provided under vote 169-77, Grants to Residential Schools, for the year 1938-39, \"Acquisition of Equipment\".\n\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nADW/B\nOttawa, November 4, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. MCGILL:\n\nYou are, no doubt, aware that in recent years certain deductions were made by the Department in the annual per capita allowances to residential schools.\n\nThe records indicate that in the fiscal year 1932-33 the deduction was 10%. In the years 1933-34 and 1934-35 this was increased to 15%. In the year 1935-36 a 10% restoration took place so that during the years 1935-36, 1936-37, 1937-38 and 1938-39 the actual net deduction has amounted to 5%.\n\nThe church authorities have been vigorously opposed to these reductions. Last year a deputation representing these churches interviewed the Minister, with the object of having the per capita allowances restored to the original figure. It is my understanding that arrangements are now under way to have a similar delegation interview the Minister and other members of the Government toward the end of this month. In view of this fact, I considered it advisable to submit an analysis of the actual cost to the Department of maintaining residential schools and also a comparison of this cost with the cost of maintaining somewhat similar institutions by provincial governments and by private organizations. The following figures indicate the actual cost to the Government of residential schools for a six year period, less interest and depreciation charges. The figures include the ordinary per capita grants less 5%; $20,000 per year medical costs, dental care, etc.; approximately $20,000 for text books, stationery supplies, etc., and the cost of repairs, equipment, etc., is also included: -\n| Fiscal year ended | Average Attendance | Residential School Expenditure | Average |\n|------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|---------|\n| March 31, 1932   | 7400               | $1,548,513.49                  | 214 p.c.|\n|                  |                    | + 20,000.00                   |         |\n|                  |                    | + 19,046.00                   |         |\n| March 31, 1933   | 7613               | 1,320,339.59                   | 180 p.c.|\n|                  |                    | + 20,000.00                   |         |\n|                  |                    | + 20,000.00                   |         |\n| March 31, 1934   | 7760               | 1,284,018.63                   | 162 p.c.|\n|                  |                    | + 20,000.00                   |         |\n|                  |                    | + 18,295.00                   |         |\n| March 31, 1935   | 7882               | 1,260,823.79                   | 165 p.c.|\n|                  |                    | + 20,000.00                   |         |\n|                  |                    | + 19,941.00                   |         |\n| March 31, 1936   | 8061               | 1,498,239.00                   | 190 p.c.|\n|                  |                    | + 20,000.00                   |         |\n|                  |                    | + 20,972.00                   |         |\n| March 31, 1937   | 8176               | 1,414,708.20                   | 180 p.c.|\n|                  |                    | + 20,000.00                   |         |\n|                  |                    | + 20,000.00                   |         |\n\nIt will be noted that only in one year - the year ended March 31, 1932, did the cost per pupil per annum at residential schools exceed $200. This cost may appear somewhat high when compared with the cost of instruction at Indian schools but is exceptionally low when compared with the per capita costs, less interest charges and depreciation at other institutions. From receipt of a statement dated October 28, 1936 from the Manitoba Department of Education, in which figures are submitted with respect to the cost of operating the Manitoba School for the Deaf, Tuxedo, Man., and the Manitoba School for Boys, Portage la Prairie, Man. These statistics indicate that the cost per pupil per annum at the Manitoba School for the Deaf during the last calendar year amounted to $642.40. The Manitoba School for Boys, Portage la Prairie, operated in conjunction with a large farm, shows a cost per pupil per annum of $550. This is a co-educational school. The boys' attendance range in age from 15 to 18. The pupils in attendance at the Manitoba School for the Deaf range in age between 6 and 17 years. Depreciation charges or interest charges on capital outlay are not included in the figures submitted by the Manitoba officials.\n\nThe Knowles School for Boys, North Kildonan, Man., is a privately operated institution for boys but is subject to supervision under the Community Chest Advisory Board of the city of Winnipeg. The age range of the boys in attendance -\nattendance at this school is between 8 and 17 years. The per capita cost at this institution - depreciation charges included - for the year 1937 amounted to $262.44.\n\nThe St. Norbert Children's Aid Society (infancy to 5 years only) is a Roman Catholic institution, established for the care of Roman Catholic orphans. The per capita costs at this institution for the year 1937 amounted to $294.84.\n\nThe St. Joseph's Orphanage, Manitoba, also a Catholic institution (boys 5 years and up) shows for the year 1937 per capita cost of $320.10.\n\nIn the Child Welfare Act (province of Alberta) the minimum rate for the maintenance of a child committed to either the Provincial Superintendent of Neglected Children or to the Children's Aid Society is $1.00 per day; in the province of Ontario the rate is 75\u00a2 a day; in the province of Saskatchewan 50\u00a2; and in the province of British Columbia $4.00 per week. While there is no minimum rate set in the Manitoba Child Welfare Act, the following are the rates of maintenance granted by the Juvenile Court Judge of Winnipeg:\n\n\"In view of all the submissions presented, the Court hereby fixes the following rates for the maintenance of children committed by this Court under Part IV of the Child Welfare Act of Manitoba:\n\nTo the Children's Aid Society of Winnipeg .. 72\u00a2\n\" \" \" \" \" \" St. Adelard 63\u00a2\nTo the Jewish Orphanage and Children's Aid of Western Canada ...... .. 63\u00a2\nTo the Director of Child Welfare ... ... 68\u00a2\"\n\nMr. Phelan, Chief of the Training Division, visited the Chilocco Indian Residential School, Oklahoma, during his holiday period of last year. This is an Indian residential school, established for the education of Indian pupils by the United States Government and operated solely as a government institution. There was at the time of Mr. Phelan's visit an enrolment of 650 pupils. Special provision has been made at this school for vocational instruction, farming, auto mechanics, printing, tailoring, domestic science, etc. The cost per pupil (less depreciation and interest charges) is $350.\n\nThe Child Welfare League of America, in one of its recent publications, states:\n\n\"More inquiries are made to this office regarding per capita costs for children in Child Welfare institutions than any other single subject. The most common inquiry is one that asks us to make a comparison between the cost of child care in a foster family home and the cost in a foster institution.\"\nThe following costs may be noted:\n\nA well equipped institution in an Eastern State (U.S.) with an adequate institutional staff as well as case work and psychiatric service - $341. per child per annum.\n\nA small foster home agency with good standards in a city of nearly one million inhabitants - $313.\n\nA well equipped and standardized children's agency in a city of more than one million inhabitants - $508.\n\nA good sized foster home agency of many years standing and with good standards in one of the largest cities in the U.S. - $405.\n\nYou will observe that the cost of maintaining pupils in our Indian residential schools is substantially lower than the cost of maintaining children in the institutions referred to in the preceding paragraphs. A number of factors are accountable, in my judgment, for these lower costs:\n\n(1) The existing agreement or understanding with the church authorities, whereby our residential schools are operated by the churches;\n\n(2) Members of religious Orders, men and women imbued with missionary zeal, are prepared to serve in these institutions for salaries that would not be acceptable to the average social service worker or public school teacher;\n\n(3) Fully equipped farms are operated in conjunction with practically all our residential schools. The revenue from these farms, particularly when crops are good, tend to keep down maintenance costs;\n\n(4) It is my understanding that a number of Women's Missionary Societies and other such auxiliary church organizations supply a number of residential schools with clothing and other articles for the comfort of the pupils, without cost. In the case of the Church of England Schools, the freight charges on these supplies are paid by the Department;\n\n(5) Substantial grants are made by the Home Mission Boards of certain churches for the upkeep of residential schools. The last audit report, dated March 1, 1928, on the Birtle Residential School (Presbyterian) shows that the church grants made to this school for the year under review amounted to $1,945.75, plus a grant of $5,300 paid in cheques for the salaries of the Principal and teaching staff.\nA fixed per capita grant is in no sense a satisfactory method of financing residential schools. This method lacks the elasticity and flexibility necessary to meet the wide variation that takes place from time to time in the cost of essential supplies. The Provinces in their desire to be fair to Child Welfare institutions have in a number of cases extended to Juvenile Court Judges the right to fix the maintenance costs from year to year. I have secured the following figures from the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission of the Anglican Church in Canada:\n\n| Variation in price of food supplies |\n|-------------------------------------|\n|                                    | 1935 | 1936 | 1937 | 1938 |\n| Flour per bbl.                     | $4.90| $4.70| $6.60| $7.00|\n| Rolled Oats, 80's                  | 6.10 | 5.60 | 7.40 | 6.60 |\n| Tea, per lb.                       | .28  | .41  | .47  | .47  |\n| Sugar, per 100 lbs.               | 5.35 | 5.35 | 6.40 | 6.30 |\n\nYou will note particularly the increase in the cost of flour during the year 1938 when compared with the cost of the same commodity during the year 1935.\n\nIt is my personal opinion that provision should be made this year for the restoration of the 5% reduction in per capita allowances. I think this restoration might take place on the understanding that the schools would assume responsibility for the payment of certain charges now borne by the Government, which do not amount to much in the aggregate but the payment of which is somewhat annoying in that it involves us in a great deal of correspondence, checking of vouchers, etc. I have in mind the payment of night watchmen at certain schools where the fire hazard is considered great. This amounts to $10,000 annually. I might mention also the payment of the freight charges on clothing and supplies purchased by missionary bodies and sent forward to the residential schools. I should like to include also the transportation costs of children to and from residential schools. In as much, however, as provision is made for the payment of these charges in the Act, I do not know that the churches would be prepared to assume this cost for the time being at least.\n\nIt is of the utmost importance, also, that the restoration should be made on the understanding that the Churches will provide greater facilities for manual training, instruction in handicraft, auto mechanics, weaving, etc. A great many of our residential schools have not the equipment -\nequipment necessary to undertake a worthwhile course in vocational instruction.\n\nA number of years ago (1911) the Government and the Churches entered into an agreement with respect to the operation of residential schools. This agreement expired in 1916 and was not renewed. I am not of the opinion that it is necessary to enter into a formal agreement with the Churches at this time, but I do suggest that an understanding be reached with the Church Authorities whereby steadily increasing emphasis will be placed on the importance of vocational instruction at residential schools. An understanding should also be reached with respect to recruiting on Indian reserves. Our inspectors and a number of our Indian agents feel that they should be consulted before recruiting is undertaken on a reserve, and it seems to me that this request is a reasonable one. Our School Inspector in British Columbia informs me that a large number of pupils are taken from year to year from districts or reserves where Indian day schools are in operation and enrolled at residential schools hundreds of miles from their homes. We have attempted to restrict this practice during the last year or two, but the practice itself is wholly unjustifiable and should cease.\n\nR. A.

This was increased to 15% in the fiscal years 1933-34 and 1934-35.\n\nA restoration of 10% took place in the fiscal year 1936-36 and for that year, as well as for the years 1936-37; 1937-38 and 1938-39, there has been a deduction of 5% in the per capita allowances.\n\nThe Churches associated with us in Indian educational work have, on several occasions, protested vigorously about the reduction in the per capita allowances. Recently they again interviewed the Minister and pointed out that it was necessary for the proper management of the schools to restore the regular per capita rates.\n\nIn preparing our Main Estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40 a deduction of 5% was made in the per capita allowances, and, in order to restore this deduction, the above amount is required.\n\nR.

The actual appropriation for the year amounted to $1,895,651. It now appears that this sum is insufficient to pay in full the per capita grants for the quarter ended December 31, 1939. It is estimated that an additional amount of $60,000 will be necessary to meet these payments.\n\nThe records indicate that until the fiscal year 1932-33 the amount necessary to pay per capita grants to residential schools, based on 100% attendance at these institutions, was voted by Parliament from year to year. A review of departmental appropriations was undertaken by the Government at that time, in an attempt to discover ways and means of effecting economies. The average attendance at that time was 94.4% and the appropriation for the succeeding year was based on the assumption that the average attendance in that year would not exceed this figure. The appropriation for the year 1939-40 was based on an average attendance of 92.24%. While actual figures are not available, the officials feel that there has been a substantial improvement in the average attendance during the year. In addition to this, we have been called upon to make greater provision than was made in former years for supernumerary pupils. These pupils are usually orphans or children deserted by their parents, for whom institutional care -\ncare has to be provided. The practice for some years has been to send them to a residential school, on the understanding that this school will be paid a grant for their care until the end of the academic year, when such pupils must be absorbed into the regular enrolment of the institution. We have at this date an attendance at residential schools of 403 pupils more than those for whom provision was made in the regular per capita grant of this year. A substantial majority of these pupils are cared for by the churches without cost to the Department. A certain number, however, are receiving supernumerary grants.\n\nI should like to discuss with you at your convenience ways and means of securing the amount necessary to meet our full obligation of this year to residential schools. It is in my judgment highly desirable that these grants should be paid at the earliest possible date.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH\n| Fiscal Year | Authorized Pupilage | Per Capita Allowance | Remarks |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------|\n|             |                     | Amount Required      | Amount Voted | Amount Spent |\n| 1932-33     | 7,968               | 1,229,499            | 1,229,499   | 1,166,595    |\n|             |                     |                      |             |              |\n|             |                     |                      |             |              |\n| 1933-34     | 8,155               | 1,109,774            | 1,125,750   | 1,135,285    |\n|             |                     |                      |             |              |\n|             |                     |                      |             |              |\n| 1934-35     | 8,193               | 1,195,911            | 1,124,250   | 1,115,914    |\n|             |                     |                      |             |              |\n|             |                     |                      |             |              |\n| 1935-36     | 8,397               | 1,298,938            | 1,296,925   | 1,254,750    |\n|             |                     |                      |             |              |\n|             |                     |                      |             |              |\n| 1936-37     | 8,480               | 1,376,711            | 1,295,988   | 1,263,027    |\n|             |                     |                      |             |              |\n|             |                     |                      |             |              |\n| 1937-38     | 8,495               | 1,365,058            | 1,295,988   | 1,295,963    |\n|             |                     |                      |             |              |\n|             |                     |                      |             |              |\n| 1938-39     | 8,615               | 1,399,997            | 1,295,988   | 1,303,958    |\n|             |                     |                      |             |              |\n|             |                     |                      |             |              |\n| 1939-40     | 8,505               | 1,399,169            | 1,371,351   | 1,369,232    |\n|             |                     |                      |             |              |\n\nThere was a 10% deduction in effect and this was considered in computing the \"Amount Required\".\n\nThere was a 10% deduction in effect and this was considered in computing the \"Amount Required\".\nFor the first time per capita was voted at a percentage of the amount required.

There were, however, certain adjustments made by this Division. These adjustments were made to correct conditions at certain residential schools, the principals of which were experiencing difficulty in securing their full quota of pupils, and in the interests of certain other schools that were making provision for a larger number of pupils than those for which the per capita grant was being paid.\n\nIn the year 1927-28 the number eligible for per capita grant payments at the Muscowequan school (R.C.), Sask., was reduced by 15 and increases were allowed at Pine Creek, Sask., (5); St. Philips (5); and Squamish (5). In the year 1938-39 the number eligible for per capita grant payments at the Cariboo school (R.C.), British Columbia, was reduced by 15 and the number allowed at Sr. Mary's Mission (R.C.), B.C., increased by 19 during the same year. In that year the grant paid at the Mount Elgin school (U.C.), Ontario, was increased from $150 to $160. This increase was made in response to a request received from the United Church, the officials of which pointed out that the Mohawk Institute was receiving per capita grant of $160, and that conditions and costs at both institutions were practically identical. In the fiscal year 1939-40 an increase of 5 was allowed at the Shingwauk school (C.E.), Ontario. The school at this point is a new building and the Principal at that time had an enrolment exceeding the number for which per capita grant was being allowed. In the fiscal year 1939-40 an adjustment took place at the Grouard (P.C.) school, Alberta. This adjustment was necessary to repay the church authorities for the construction of the new fireproof wing built by them at Grouard. The adjustment covers a 10 year period, specified in an agreement between the Minister and the church authorities. The increase of 5 at Ahousaht was due to the destruction of the Alberni school by fire and the transfer of these pupils to the Ahousaht school.\n\nThe proposed increase of 60 at Cross Lake (R.C.), Manitoba -\nManitoba, is due to the rebuilding of the school at that point and the increase of 20 at Sandy Bay is due to the reconstruction of the Sandy Bay school and the additional provision made for pupils in the two fire-proof wings constructed during the summer of 1939.\n\nThe total increases for the period under review, you will note, amount to $62,580, and the decreases to $4,515, leaving a net increase of $58,065.\n\nI am sending forward also statement indicating the authorized pupilage, the amount voted for this purpose and the amount actually spent, for the years 1935-36 to 1939-40, inclusive. Both these statements should be studied and compared with the statement on the authorized enrolment at residential schools, recently prepared and now in your possession.\n\nR. A.

McGill,\nDir. of Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nWhen the Estimates for next fiscal year were under consideration in your absence shortly after the new year, the Minister at one time considered the possibility of making a general cut in the salaries of all Day School teachers. The reason for this was that he thought the Indian Day School teachers were paid on the whole a much higher salary than teachers in rural white schools. The suggestion was not put into effect as the reductions were made in other places. The Minister, however, suggested that the question of the salaries of Day School Teachers should be given further consideration for the purpose of seeing whether it might not be possible to effect economies, and at the same time make them more in line with similar salaries paid elsewhere.\n\nI am returning herewith the report of the Research Committee of the Manitoba Teachers' Federation for the academic year 1938-39. You will notice that the average salary for the year 1938-39 was $539.60 and that for the year 1937-38 the average was only $513.26. These are certainly much lower than the average salaries of the Indian Day School teachers, although it is possible that the latter's period of service each year is longer.\n\nThe Minister thought it might be wise to consider establishing different classes for our teachers based, among other things, on the average number of pupils, the location of the school, the grades taught therein and the period of teaching, taking into consideration at the same time whether they are provided with living accommodation.\n\nWill you please give the above consideration and let me have a full report for the information of the Minister.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nEnc.\nMANITOBA TEACHERS' FEDERATION\n\nResearch Committee\n\nReport for the year 1938-39.\n\nTo the President\nand Members of Conference:\n\nDuring the year the Research Committee met at intervals as a whole or in sub-committees to consider matters which we deemed of interest to the teachers of Manitoba. Some of these we now present to you.\n\nQuestionnaires were sent to rural and graded schools. We sincerely thank those who sent the required information. Particularly do we wish to thank the Principals of the graded schools for the return of their staff reports which showed fine cooperation with almost one hundred per cent (100%) of them being returned.\n\nA great amount of time and energy has been spent on compiling information obtained from these reports and it is indeed unfortunate that we have no filing system in our office for the information on graded schools. One could be obtained for a very moderate outlay and would I am sure prove valuable.\n\nThe work this year has been done by a committee of Misses M. Larter, N. Thompson, O. Ormond, F. Cheshiro and Messrs. Jas. Holmes, R.C. Paris, C.G. Cooke, L.J. Crocker, assisting this committee were Mr. Newfield, Mr. Chadwick and others. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them all.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nApril 11, 1939.\n\nInez L.

'38) reveals but little change. Whereas, in last year's report 45.3 per cent of teachers had been but one year in their present school, this year's report shows that figure as 40.8 - a slight betterment in the situation.\n\nAgain, this year's report also shows a slight betterment in years of total experience; 11.8 per cent of teachers having a total of one year's experience compared with 18.0 per cent last year.\n\nWith regard to the number of teachers employed during the 5-year period this year's report indicates a very slight improvement in the situation.\n\nIt should be pointed out, however, that in all cases mentioned, the figures indicating differences are so small that they are barely significant.\n\nSALARIES\n\nThere is nothing very startling about my findings. However, I do believe that a study of 400 rural school questionnaires taken at random gives a fairly accurate picture of the situation in Manitoba. To enable you to check this statement I took the privilege of tabulating two other items on the questionnaire for the sampling that I studied. I refer to questions 2d-(a) and 4a. Incidentally, I made some use of the information in arriving at my findings which I list herewith:\n\nSALARY: Average 1938-39 contract - $539.60\nAverage 1937-38 contract - $513.26\nAverage increase - $26.34\n\nBOARD: Average cost of board per month - $16.26\n\nThe average rural teacher spends more than 30% of her income for board in the district where she teaches. Several board areas in the district to enable ratepayers to pay off their taxes.\n\nTEACHERAGES: Teacherages are available in 24% of these rural school districts. In one district, however, the school residence is not available to the teacher because the teacher happens to have two small children.\n\nARREARS: Out of 400 cases studied, 46 rural school teachers gave $4377.10 as salary arrears at Nov.1, 1938. Thirty of these teachers were under contract at $500, per annum or less. It is deplorable that 11.5% of these rural teachers must wait from June 30th to November 1st and longer for their first cheque often for no other reason but that it is convenient for the school board.\nTENURE: The teachers in these rural schools have an average of 2.66 years experience in their PRESENT schools.\n\nCLASS/SIZE: The average rural school has an enrolment of 24 - 25 pupils.\n\nTEACHERS: 64% of these rural school teachers are women.\n\nP.S.: Length of experience, school enrolment, sex of teacher, academic or professional qualifications of teachers do not seem to influence the salaries of rural school teachers in Manitoba. Woman teachers in school districts having an enrolment of 7 or 8 pupils receive, in a number of cases, higher salaries than men in districts where 40-50 pupils attend school.\n\n(The committee was unable to complete the study for graded schools, high schools, etc. In many of these schools restorations on a moderate scale were made.)\n\nPROFESSIONAL JOURNALS\n\nAll, of course, get the Manitoba School Journal. Taking 400 returns from one-room rural schools as a good sampling, we found the following in order of popularity:\n\nThe Grade Teacher\nThe Western Teacher\nThe Canadian Teacher\nModern Instructor\nGeographic Magazine\nThe School (Toronto)\nChild Education\nRed Cross\nPrimary Service\n\nThe Educator\nSchool Arts\nHealth Bulletin\nMaster Seatwork\nDents Teacher's Aids\nPictorial Education\nProgressive Teacher\nForest and Outdoors\n\nA very few (less than a dozen) say they cannot afford to take any professional journals at present salary. A number of teachers say they are using ones subscribed to in former years. Other teachers say that the radio educational features and Western School Journal supply all the material along that line that they have time for.\n\nOne teacher receiving $575 per year subscribed to three professional journals.\n\nOf indirect benefit to the teacher professionally in supplying up-to-date information on present day topics, for enlarging viewpoints, or in providing a means of escape from uncongenial surroundings were listed.- Readers Digest, Literary Digest, Macleans, World Affairs, The Forum, The Chatelaine, Current Events.\n\nSALARIES AND BOARD IN RURAL ONE-ROOM SCHOOLS\n\n| Year | Salary | Board |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| 1930-31 | $856 | $230 |\n| 1931-32 | 728 | 205 |\n| 1932-33 | 619 | 176 |\n| 1933-34 | 492 | 158 |\n| 1934-35 | 478 | 136 |\n| 1935-36 | 465 | 153 |\n| 1936-37 | 492 | 154 |\n| 1937-38 | 522 | 169 |\n| 1938-39 | 540 | 163 |\n\nPOOR COPY\nNUMBER OF FAMILIES IN RURAL DISTRICTS\n\n56 schools report 1-5 families represented\n162 \" \" 6-10 \" \"\n120 \" \" 11-15 \" \"\n62 \" \" 16-20 \" \"\n19 \" \" 21-25 \" \"\n4 \" \" over 25 \" \"\n\nOne district in an old settled community has 4 pupils from 2 families but there are over a dozen families in that district. There are 62 schools reporting 16 to 20 families with pupils in school but there are 115 districts with 16 to 20 families.\n\nRADIOS IN RURAL DISTRICTS\n\nA study of the rural returns indicates that there is an improvement in connection with radio during the past year. From these returns we estimate that there are over 10,000 radio sets in the one-room school districts. There should therefore be at least forty thousand rural listeners.\n\nOut of 400 rural districts, one reports a radio in the school; 100 teachers are boarding where there is no radio; 300 have the privilege of listening to broadcasts.\n\n7 school districts have not a single set\n4 \" \" 1 set\n25 \" \" 2 sets\n30 \" \" 3 \"\n24 \" \" 4 \"\n28 \" \" 5 \"\n42 \" \" 6 \"\n26 \" \" 7 \"\n24 \" \" 8 \"\n25 \" \" 9 \"\n40 \" \" 10 \"\n29 \" \" 11 \"\n32 \" \" 12 \"\n55 \" \" more than 12\n\nA few did not report the number.\n\nSPECIAL STUDIES\n\nThe Federation office gets many papers, magazines and reports. From time to time some of these are of educational value and members of the Research Committee read these, report on them, and in some cases give extensive reviews.\n\nAmong these were:\n\nSize Factor in one-room schools reviewed by James F. Holmes, of St. James.\nReports from Quebec, by R.C. Paris, of St. James.\nQuebec Survey (Hepburn), by Miss Cheshire, of Winnipeg.\nSuggestions for helps, by A.C. Chadwick, of Ewart.\nTenure problems and legislation, by J.H. Hall.\nHomework problems in conjunction with a study being made by R.E. Shaw, of Alberta.\nSchool organization and city administration, by Geo. M. Newfield.\n\nThe Committee thinks this type of work should be extended and would recommend that the next Research Committee investigate the matter and try to make use of the personal readings and study of a host of teachers.\n\nWinnipeg, Man.,\nApril 6th, 1939.\nOttawa, February 14, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCILL\n\nIn response to your request, I am sending forward herewith statement indicating the residential schools at which per capita payments for the quarter ending December 31, 1938, have not yet been made.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 16, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Salaries of Indian Day School Teachers\n\nI have for acknowledgment Mr. Jackson's memorandum of February 13 and also report of the Research Committee of the Manitoba Teachers' Federation for the academic year 1938-39, attached thereto.\n\nI may state that immediately following a discussion of the 1940-41 estimates, which took place at your office a few weeks ago, a very thorough survey and investigation of the salaries paid Indian day school teachers was undertaken by the officials of the Welfare and Training Division. I am attaching hereto, for your information, a statement prepared by these officials. In this statement you will find the number of teachers in white rural schools for the year 1938 and the salaries paid to the teachers. You will note also the number of Indian day school teachers employed in each of the provinces. These teachers are classified and placed in the salary brackets allowed by this Department. I regret to say that in the case of the province of Quebec we have been unable at this date to secure a statement of the salaries paid to public school teachers.\n\nIn a discussion relating to the salaries that should be paid Indian day school teachers, one cannot be too careful to keep in mind a number of factors that have a direct bearing on the matter. The location of our Indian day schools is important. The officials of the United Church have on more than one occasion protested vigorously against the refusal of the Department to pay the transportation costs of the teachers nominated by the United -\nthe United Church for service at Indian day schools in outlying districts. These officials have pointed out that transportation costs to a number of these schools amount to $200. It is my understanding that in many cases this amount is advanced by the missionary Societies and later refunded at the rate of so much per month by the teachers. Indian day school teachers, unlike public school teachers, do not qualify for superannuation allowances and are subject to dismissal at 65. Our school teachers and the Teachers' Federation of the province of Saskatchewan have recently petitioned the Department to make provision for a teachers' superannuation fund. The obstacles, however, standing in the way of the creation of such a fund are in my judgment almost insurmountable.\n\nIn discussing Indian administration on a number of reserves with Indian agents who have visited Ottawa during the last two or three years, I have been deeply impressed by the assistance our Indian agents are able to give from our school teachers. Where an Indian agent lives 50 or 60 or 100 miles away from a reserve, he invariably communicates with the teacher in respect to relief allowances, complaints that have reached him from the Indians, the receipt of medical and other supplies, the best date or dates for the payment of twenty allowances, etc. We are not now making, nor have we at any time made, an allowance to teachers to cover the cost even of postage and other incidental expenses inseparable from these services. The emphasis that we are now placing on vocational instruction, carpentry work, elementary agriculture and hand-loom weaving, etc., is imposing additional burdens upon our teachers. Dr. Robertson has been insisting for a couple of years that only married teachers be employed and employed on the understanding that the man will assist in the promotion of agriculture on the reserve and that his wife will engage in the organization of women's clubs, etc. One of the most encouraging features of Indian administration at this date is in my judgment in evidence at Indian day schools where an increasingly large number of teachers have with very little encouragement or direction from the Department organized extra curricular activities on the reserve. References to these activities\nand their success appeared from time to time in the monthly reports of the Superintendent of Welfare and Training.\n\nIt should be borne in mind also that Indian day schools are not subject to the same inspection as public schools, for the simple reason that many of them are almost inaccessible. This means that we are almost wholly dependent on the ability and willingness of the teacher in charge of the school to give of his or her best without direction or without the oversight ordinarily exercised by the trustees and inspectors in the case of public schools.\n\nDrastic reductions have taken place in the salaries paid public school teachers during the period of the depression. The salaries paid in the case of a number of the provinces went far below the statutory minimum existing in such provinces with respect to waitresses, dish washers and the lowest classes of unskilled labour. At the same time the provincial educational authorities have been steadily elevating academic and professional standing, with the result that in a great many of the provinces now a teacher must have completed first year Arts or its equivalent, plus one year in normal school, plus three summer courses at a recognized summer school, before he or she can qualify for a permanent certificate. The result is exactly what one might expect: Canada is now confronted with a shortage of fully qualified teachers and in two of the provinces - Alberta and British Columbia - this shortage has become quite acute. We are not vitally concerned with the province of Alberta, as we have only one day school in that province, but we are unable at this date to secure the teachers necessary to conduct our schools in the province of British Columbia. Commissioner MacKay, in a letter to the Department dated January 10, 1940, states: \"The second teacher has not been thus far secured for Gitladamix, and Bishop Rix informed me yesterday that he is continuing to make inquiries for a suitable teacher but at the moment had no one whom he could nominate. I may say that every effort is being made to secure qualified teachers for the existing vacancies in our Indian schools, all of which happen to be in the diocese of Caledonia. The Provincial Department of Education has been asked to assist, but owing to the scarcity of fully qualified teachers, the province is faced with a similar problem to our own and is\nnot at present in a position to help.\"\n\nThe Minister of Education for the province of Alberta, in his 1932 report, on page 8 states: \"For the first time in years, a distinct shortage of teachers was experienced during the summer and fall of 1932. With an increase in registrations at our normal schools, however, it is our hope that supply and demand will come into balance again.\" My prediction is that unless there is a substantial increase in the salaries now paid to public school teachers throughout the Dominion, we shall during the next two or three years revert to the same conditions that existed in Canada during the last war and during the early twenties. In these times, provincial departments of education were compelled by force of circumstances to issue permits to at least 25% of the teachers, thus enabling them to take charge of schools, despite the fact that they had neither the academic standing nor the professional qualifications to undertake such work.\n\nWe have no seasonal schools at this date in operation in the provinces of Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan or Alberta. We have a few in operation in the other provinces. The desirability of abandoning these schools where the enrolment is 10 or less is now under consideration.\n\nThe suggestion made by the Minister and referred to by Mr. Jackson in the penultimate paragraph of his memorandum was adopted insofar as it was at all practicable to adopt it in fixing the salaries of teachers at the start of the 1932-40 academic year. There are certain difficulties, however, that confront the officials when they attempt to adopt the suggestion in the case of certain schools. For example, Indian Agent Hudson recommends the retirement of the present teacher at the Indian Island Day School in New Brunswick who has reached the age of 65, and the employment of a married man, who would be prepared to give direction to agricultural operations on the reserve and whose wife might be charged with the responsibility of organizing the women into a worthwhile women's group. Mr. Hudson assured us that only in this way can we hope to get a number of the Indians in his agency off relief. Ninety-nine per cent. of his Indians are now in receipt of relief allowances.\nallowances from the Department. Should it be decided to adopt Mr. Hudson's suggestion, although the enrolment at this school is comparatively small, it would not be possible to secure a married man, trained in the sense that Mr. Hudson thinks he should be trained, for the salary paid the present teacher. The present salary amounts to $700 a year.\n\nDirector.\nFebruary 23, 1940.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE ADMINISTRATOR IN COUNCIL\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT Vote 163, the main estimates 1939-40, Department of Mines and Resources, provided an amount of $1,295,351.00 for per capita grants to Indian residential schools and that supplementary estimate No. 620 provided an amount of $76,000.00 for the same purpose, or a total amount of $1,371,351.00.\n\nTHAT the above amount was provided on the assumption that the average attendance at all Indian residential schools would not exceed 92.85% of the total authorized pupilage;\n\nTHAT owing to gradual increase of school population and the necessity of providing residential school maintenance for several children in destitute circumstances, the average enrolment exceeded the percentage mentioned above and, therefore, an additional amount of $62,662.86 is required to complete the payments of per capita grants for the quarter ended December 31, 1939;\n\nTHAT unless the above amount is paid immediately to the Churches responsible for the operation of the schools it will not be possible for the Churches to provide the services -- food, clothing etc. -- essential for the Indian pupils in attendance.\n\nThe undersigned accordingly recommends, the necessity being urgent, that in pursuance of the provisions of Section 25, Cap. 27, the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act 1931, a Governor General's Warrant be issued for the sum of $62,662.86 for the purpose above noted.\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nFebruary 23, 1940.\n\nPRECIS:\n\nTo secure Governor General's warrant for payment of $62,882.85 for per capita grants to Indian residential schools.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDir. of Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nRe - Salaries of Indian Day School Teachers (file 1-1-3).\n\nI have your memorandum of the 16th instant in reference to the above. The Minister will I am sure be interested in reading your comments.\n\nThe statement setting forth the salaries paid by all the Provinces to teachers in white rural schools would seem to indicate very clearly that our average salary is much higher, for example,\n\nProvince of Nova Scotia - Only 8 teachers out of 1416 receive salary of $800 or over, whereas the 11 teachers employed by the Department are all paid this sum or more.\n\nProvince of New Brunswick - Only 17 teachers out of 1426 receive salary of $800 or over, whereas 14 out of 15 of those employed by the Department receive this sum.\n\nProvince of Ontario - Only 1990 teachers out of 5284 receive salary of $800 or over, whereas 86 teachers out of a total of 103 employed by the Department receive this sum or more.\n\nProvince of Manitoba - Only 26 teachers out of a total of 1325 receive $800 or over, whereas 45 out of a total of 55 employed by the Department receive this sum or more.\n\nProvince of Saskatchewan - Only 67 teachers out of a total of 4255 receive $800 or more, whereas 24 out of a total of 31 employed by the Department receive this sum or more.\n\nProvince of British Columbia - The salaries appear to be more in line with those of the Department.\nThe statement does not show whether any allowance was made for the living accommodation provided to many of our teachers. It is assumed the comparison was based on the actual cash salary paid. If so, the difference would be greater.\n\nYou have set forth some good reasons why teachers at Indian Day Schools should be paid at a higher rate. It is not clear, however, that in fixing the salaries whether the special considerations you mention were kept in mind. Is it not a fact that only a small proportion of the teachers interest themselves actively in the welfare of the Indians and devote a good part of their time in doing the kind of work, for instance, that Dr. Robertson expects of them. If this should be true, is it not possible to compensate them for this extra service and at the same time reduce the salaries of other teachers who either because of their lack of interest or because the school is so situated that they are unable to, or it is not necessary for them to perform such services.\n\nIt is appreciated that it may be difficult to arrive at a definite scale but there would appear to be no good reason for paying all of our teachers on a scale higher than the average paid by the Provinces, unless they are all performing services not performed by the teachers in white rural schools. It is suggested that further consideration might be given to exploring the possibility of adjusting the salaries of those teachers who are not performing such services. Perhaps it might be possible to fix basic rates and when extra duties are placed upon any of the teachers, a special allowance made for the work involved.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\nMISSIONS CATHOLIQUES DU MACKENZIE\nR. C. MISSIONS OF MACKENZIE\n\nFort Smith, N.W.T.,\nFebruary 29, 1940.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe last scheduled airmail trip down the Mackenzie for the winter season is ordinarily arranged in such a way that it is impossible for our schools and hospitals located north of Fort-Smith to have their quarterly or monthly reports mailed before the month of June, thus causing inconvenience to your Branch for the closing of the fiscal year and postponing payment of the grants at a very late date. The same thing occurs also in the fall, when reports for September quarter or September month cannot reach your office before or even after Xmas.\n\nWhen discussing lately various affairs with His Excellency Archbishop Breguet, he has suggested me to write you in connection with this unfortunate situation, and he has asked me to inquire whether or not you would object to our schools and hospitals located north of Fort Smith making their quarterly or monthly reports so that the last fall and spring scheduled mail might be able to take them out. This would mean that reports from schools and hospitals would close as at the 23rd or 25th, as may be the case, of March end of September, instead of closing as at the end of month or quarter. The next reports would of course include these few supplementary days which were omitted in the previous returns.\n\nThis arrangement would favor the R.C. Indian Residential Schools of Fort Resolution, Fort Providence, Aklavik, also the R.C. Hospitals located at Aklavik, Fort Simpson and Fort Resolution. Your decision and the kind consideration you will undoubtedly give to our request will be greatly and gratefully appreciated.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nFather J. Serrurot, O.M.I.,\nBursar.\nOttawa,\nMarch 7, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. MCGILL\n\nIn view of the information contained in Father Ferrurot's letter of February 29 regarding the mail service I consider we could advise him that he can forward the March quarter returns of the residential schools on March 23 and the September quarter returns on September 23 but they should be prepared as if they had been completed on March 31 and September 30 respectively. That is, for all pupils in residence on March 23 and September 23 he should ask grant for the full quarter.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMarch 8, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 29th ultimo which refers to quarterly returns from the residential schools in the Diocese of Mackenzie I may say that there will be no objection to your forwarding the March quarter return about March 23 and the September quarter return about September 25.\n\nHowever, in doing so you should prepare the returns as if they had been completed on March 31 and September 30 respectively. If there are any adjustments between those dates and the end of the quarters the necessary deductions can be made from the return for the following quarter.\n\nI am referring your letter to the Superintendent of Medical Services, Dr. Stone, in order that he might write to you regarding the hospital returns.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

When the complete returns for the period were received, however, it was discovered that an additional amount of $62,662.88 was required to pay the grants in full to December 31, 1938. This additional amount has now been provided by Governor General's Warrant.\n\nYou are no doubt aware that there is a recognised pupilage at each of our residential schools. It was the practice of the Department until the fiscal year 1937-38 to provide in the estimates the total amount required to pay per capita grants in full and such amounts were based on the assumption that each school would have its authorized enrolment of pupils and that the attendance would average approximately 100%. For example, the total authorized pupilage at all residential schools for the fiscal year 1937-38 was 7,992 and the amount required to pay the per capita grant in full, $1,129,493.00. This was the amount voted. The amount actually disbursed because in that fiscal year was only $1,106,295.70. I should state that it was the practice in those years to make advances to a number of residential schools from the surplus funds available.\n\nThe Government, in an attempt to economize, decided -\ndecided in the fiscal year 1933-34 to vote only the amount sufficient to pay per capita grants on the assumption that the average attendance at residential schools would not exceed approximately 95%. For the fiscal year 1933-34, while the amount required to pay the per capita grants in full was $1,189,774.60, the amount actually voted was $1,126,750.00. In other words, for the first time in the history of the Department, the amount voted was insufficient to meet our financial obligations to the churches charged with the responsibility of operating our residential schools. However, inasmuch as payments had been made to certain residential schools in advance, it was not found necessary that year, or for a number of years, to ask for a supplementary estimate.\n\nNo attempt has been made in recent years to correct this condition or to revert to the policy in force prior to the fiscal year 1933-34. I have never been able to convince myself that the policy in effect since 1933-34 is sound. The Government has a large investment in Indian residential schools and the principals in charge of these institutions should be encouraged to operate them efficiently and to aim not at a low average attendance but at the highest average attendance possible.\n\nI feel that the time has now arrived when we should provide from year to year the total amount required to operate our residential schools on the assumption that these schools will have an average attendance of pupils of approximately 95%. I am sending forward, for your information, memorandum submitted to me by the Superintendent of Welfare and Training, dated February 8, 1940. I am sending forward also a statement showing the authorized pupilage at each residential school during the year 1939 and the actual average pupilage during the same year. I should like to direct your attention particularly to the summary of this statement which reads as follows:\n\n| Month | Total authorised pupilage at all residential schools | Total average attendance stall residential schools | Per cent of average to authorized pupilage |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| March 1939 | 8538 | 8250.05 | 96.63 |\n| June 1939 | 8538 | 8308.48 | 97.32 |\n| Sept. 1939 | 8538 | 8150.28 | 95.46 |\n| Dec. 1939 | 8538 | 8275.44 | 96.96 |\nIn preparing the estimates for the present fiscal year (1940-41) the amount requested for per capita grants was $1,271,249.00. This sum represents 92.24% of the amount that would be required to make our per capita grant payments for the present fiscal year if our schools operated with their full quota of pupils and with an average attendance of approximately 100%.\n\nFrom our experience in 1939 you will note that an additional amount will be necessary for the fiscal year 1940-41 as it is now apparent that the total average attendance will exceed by a substantial margin an average of 92.24%. In fact, for the year 1939 it averaged 96.59% and there is every reason to believe that it will be as much, if not more, during the current year. The Indian school population is increasing at the rate of approximately 300 per annum. This fact in itself must tend toward a higher enrolment at residential schools. The number of orphan and neglected children for whom provision must be made at these institutions appears to have increased steadily during the depression years.\n\nIn view of the fact that the payments for the quarter ended March 31, 1940, are now due, I am anxious that a decision should be reached at an early date with respect to the amounts that should be paid. The officials of the Treasury feel that they should have specific instructions with respect to the policy of the Government in this regard before any payments for the March quarter are actually made.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, April 15, 1940.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Minister,\n\nWith respect to my attached memorandum to you of April 11, I think it well to point out that when the estimates for the coming fiscal year were being prepared some six months ago the figures presented in the attached memorandum were not available.\n\nThe estimates were based on the average attendance for the previous fiscal year, 92,242. Even had these figures been available it would have made no difference as we were under instruction not to increase the vote.\n\nDirector.\n\nEnclosure.\nMr. R.A. Hoey  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRumour has it that the Department of Indian Affairs is considering reduction either in the grant or in the pupilage of our Indian Residential Schools. If this rumour is founded it is to be hoped that the Department will bear in mind that there has been a considerable increase in the cost of living since the beginning of the war. The Canadian Press, under date of February 28th, carried the following news:\n\n\"The Dominion Bureau of Statistics reports its general commodity prices index rose to 82.9 in the week ended Feb 23 from 82.5 in the previous week and 73.3 in the corresponding week last year.\n\nIt will be seen from the above that if the Department puts into effect a 10% reduction either in the grant or in the pupilage, our Residential Schools will be operating under a 20% reduction as between this year and last year, the rise in commodity prices amounts in itself to more than 10%.\n\nIt is sincerely to be hoped, therefore, that the Department will not put into effect any reduction either in grant or pupilage without consulting the representatives of the Church organisations engaged in Indian work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\n**DEPARTMENT:** Mines and Resources  \n**BRANCH:** Indian Affairs  \n**DATE:** May 2, 1940.\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n| 1940-41    | Receiver General | $2,025.00 |\n|            | Cr.

McGill,\nDirector, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nThe copy of your circular letter of the 22nd ultimo,\nNo. 1-1-3, addressed to Principals of Indian Residential\nSchools, reached me some days ago, and I have been\nendeavouring ever since to find some way of averting\nthe very serious consequences to our Society which the\ndecision of the Government set forth therein, will\ninevitably bring.\n\nSpeaking for myself personally, although I am con-\nvinced that the same view is held by every member of our\nSociety, I realize that the extreme gravity of the\nEuropean situation makes it impossible for the Church\nSocieties cooperating with your Department of Government\nin Indian educational work, to ask for a reconsideration\nof the latter's decision to reduce the per capita grants.\n\nThe reduction of the privilege to 92.24 per cent, as\nsuggested by you, would not make an appreciable difference\nin the operating cost of any School, and when I point\nout that our Society has now a bank overdraft of $35,586.00,\nor which 44% must be paid, and that the reduction in the\nper capita grant will mean a yearly loss in revenue of at\nleast $21,000.00, you will understand my profound concern\nin the matter.\n\nIn my position as Secretary and Executive officer of\nour Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission, I am\nexpected to suggest some way whereby our Indian Schools\nmay be kept in operation, and I now write for the specific purpose of ascertaining if your Department of Government could arrange for a certain number of the refugee children who are, I understand, to be brought to Canada in the near future, to be accommodated at some of our Schools on a per capita grant earning basis. If our Commission limited the Indian pupilage to the number you suggested in your circular, we would distribute among the Schools located near to the railway lines a total of one hundred of the refugees. The Schools I have in mind are as follows:\n\nChapleau ........ 10\nShingweau ....... 20\nSioux Lookout... 20\nElkhorn .......... 10\nBlackfoot ....... 20\nBlood ........... 15\nPeigan .......... 5\n\nI am assuming that the Government will be obliged to allocate a certain sum of money for the care of the refugees, and that the grant for any accommodated at our Schools would be provided from that special source and not from the approved estimates for your Department.\n\nAs the above suggestion is intended to help the Government as well as our Society, I will be interested to learn at your earliest convenience if there is any possibility of its being accepted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTHW/KH\nOttawa, June 19, 1940.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of June 7, in which you submit, for departmental consideration, a suggestion that provision be made at a number of residential schools operated by the Government, in co-operation with your Commission, for the care of 100 refugee children.\n\nI am not in a position at this date to state what provision is likely to be made by the Government for the care of refugee children in the Dominion. I am, however, sending forward your suggestion to the Minister for his consideration. Should the Government decide to make provision for the care of refugees at residential schools, I am disposed to think that they would be likely to take over one or two schools for this purpose rather than send small numbers of refugee children to a number of schools throughout the Dominion. However, this is just my personal opinion. I shall be glad to communicate with you again in respect to the matter when I am in a position to supply you with more definite information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nReverend T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.S.C.C.,\n28-48 The Bible House,\n164 Alexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba\nOttawa, June 18, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am attaching hereto copy of a circular letter sent out to the Principals of our Indian residential schools and dated Ottawa, May 26, 1940, and also copy of a reply received by me from Dr. T. H. R. Westgate, Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.\n\nI have acknowledged receipt of this letter and intimated to Dr. Westgate that I am sending forward to you for your consideration the suggestion made by him with respect to the care of refugee children at Indian residential schools.\n\nYou will note that the Anglican Residential School Commission have a bank overdraft at this date of $5,566. In addition to this, it is just possible that they are no longer able to secure funds from old country sources for missionary effort in this country. I am of the opinion, therefore, that they will experience the utmost difficulty in keeping their Indian residential schools open and in operation during the war period.\n\nShould the Government decide to make provision for a number of refugee children at Indian residential schools, it would be advisable, in my judgment, to take over two or three residential schools and operate them for this purpose rather than send groups of children to a large number of our residential schools throughout the Dominion.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH\nOttawa,\nAugust 6, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDOCTOR MCGILL\n\nIn the current year's appropriation provision is made on a basis of nine months only for the under-mentioned combined white and Indian day schools at each of which we have allowed, for many years past, a regular amount each year:\n\n| NAME OF SCHOOL          | AMOUNT REQUIRED FOR TEN-MONTH TERM | VOTED FOR NINE-MONTH TERM | EXTRA AMOUNT REQUIRED FOR ADDITIONAL MONTH |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| ONTARIO                 |                                    |                           |                                            |\n| Hiawatha                | $300.00                            | $270.00                   | $30.00                                     |\n| Honey Harbour           | 350.00                             | 315.00                    | 35.00                                      |\n| Mattawa                 | 350.00                             | 315.00                    | 35.00                                      |\n| Michipicoten Harbour    | 700.00                             | 630.00                    | 70.00                                      |\n| Whitefish River         | 1,000.00                           | 900.00                    |                                            |\n| MANITOBIA               |                                    |                           |                                            |\n| Jack River C.E.         | 650.00                             | 585.00                    |                                            |\n| Moose Lake              | 350.00                             | 315.00                    | 35.00                                      |\n| Round Plain             | 600.00                             | 540.00                    | 60.00                                      |\n\nAdditional amount needed for 6 combined schools in order to pay them on a ten-month basis .................. $265.00\nThe usual grant for Whitefish River has been paid for the months of April, May and June amounting to $300.00. Owing to small attendance of Indian children at this school the authorities have been advised that no further payments will be made to them. As $300.00 was voted for this school there will be an unexpended balance of $600.00.\n\nPayment of $195.00 has been made to the Jack River C.E. School for the months of April, May and June. Due to the small attendance of Indian children the authorities of this school have also been notified that it was our intention to reduce the grant from $65.00 a month to $17.50 a month from September 1st, 1940.
