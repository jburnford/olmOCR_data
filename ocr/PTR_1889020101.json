It has been organized under the most favorable auspices; it has a wide field to work in and must if properly conducted be of inestimable benefit to the country and to the advancement of science and learning. It is fortunate in having among its officers members of much ability, of education and of literary and scientific attainments. During the winter months short papers will be read on various literary and scientific subjects, and in the summer the work of the society will be more particularly directed to field work. We hail with pleasure the organization of the Saskatchewan Institute, and trust that everyone in the district will take a keen interest in it and contribute what they can to its success. Now that the initiative has been taken and the Institute formed no scruples or fears should deter any person from joining and taking a deep interest in the work.\n\nOn the subject of railway settlement there seems to be somewhat blighted hopes. A report has come to hand evidently on good authority, to the effect that the negotiations between the C.P.R. and Regina & Lake Road have fallen through and that no contract will be signed with the latter company until after the present election. If such be the case this district will be in a bad plight, we have pointed out time and again that a railway is an absolute necessity. That without one we cannot remain connected except to starve. We consider that we are not being fairly treated by the Government in this respect, and that if some immediate action is not taken we shall lose our railway communications in this direction. If the same serious settlement will cease to exist. If terms cannot be made with the Regina Road an offer should be made to the Manitoba & North Western and to that made to the R.C.L.R. Railway, which if it is not sufficient we consider that a cash subsidy should be given to any line that will come into Prince Albert and Bitter Creek at once.\n\nAnother matter requiring the attention of the Government is the necessity of a post office and other public buildings at this point. The building now being used for a post office, besides being very unsafe, does not give the convenience and accommodation required. All other Government offices here are in the same fix. The Government pay about $300 per annum for the buildings at present in use. They can borrow money at five per cent, and $300 would pay the interest on $15,000. Ten thousand dollars would erect a block which would be ample sufficient for all purposes for a number of years, and then about $300 would be saved to the community. With such a block, and proper heating and lighting arrangements would be made in fuel, the buildings now in use are so poorly built as to require an uncalculated expenditure for heating purposes. If we cannot get a railroad the authorities will still do us this especial act; it will make a saving in the end to the Dominion.\n\nAfter the lapse of seven months the expenses of the Legislative Assembly elections have been paid.\n\nThe official report just published shows a surplus of $3,000,000 in the Dominion treasury for the past financial year.\n\nTHE TORONTO WORLD\nIs absolutely the best daily Paper in Canada.\nThe Toronto World is the only Paper in Canada which is not only printed but also bound, delivered, and distributed throughout Canada.\nIt is printed twice daily, and sent to every part of the Dominion.\nIt is the only Paper which is sold in every part of the Dominion.\nIt is the only Paper which is delivered to every part of the Dominion.\nIt is the only Paper which is bound, delivered, and distributed throughout Canada.\n\nCampbell's Cathartic Compound\nTonic Elixir\nBaking Powder\nCardigan Jackets\nPea Jackets\nRemnants of Carpets\nChoice Selection of Ladies' Hosiery\nMen's Overshoes at cost for cash\nMitts and Mocassins\nA Paying Investment.\nFrames Our Stock.\nR.

The new stage is the first driver of an old Calgary stage, the proprietor being Mr. John Macdonald. The trip was made last week, the stage was loaded by police, barrel and trunk containing liquor was found. The whole carft was seen and taken to the police station, where the man placed under arrest. The team and wagon were released and taken to Stand- man's store at the same time. The man was told that the driver, Readon, knew nothing of the contents of the barrel and trunk. Neither he nor the pro- prietor of the stage was charged. The stage was delivered to the police station, loaded on the stage. They were delivered at the stage office in Calgary, and handed over to the police. The stage was fined $100 and costs and the team and stage, which did not belong to him, confiscated. A police constable was sent to Standman's store to take the team and wagon. Acting under orders Standman refused to give up the team until the bill for fine and costs was paid. The police went to the barracks for fur- ther instructions, and Sup't Macdonald was ordered to send the team and wagon. Standman still refuses, the police taking forcible possession. The case has been appealed. Mr. Haultain for defendant.\n\nEDMONTON.\n\nFrom the Bulletin, Dec. 8.\n\nStill no snow, no zero weather, no thaw to be expected.\n\nJ.D. Wilson, of the H.R.

Hirding, of Edmonton, was returned to him at Stony Plain on Saturday evening within six hours after the first appearance of the advertisement. The dog, described as a couple of months old, by Dr. Wilson has also been recovered. The moral is plain.\n\nQU'APPELLE.\n\nFrom the Vindicator, Jan. 17.\n\nA cold wave has struck this part of the North-Western the worst.

The members consisted of Messrs. Davis and Couns. Woodman, Donaldson, Goddard, Sanderson, Davis and Mair.\n\nThe Finance and Assessment, Board of Works, Health and Relief, and the Fire, Water and Light Departments made their reports; but not being in accordance with the procedure by law, were thrown out on the following motion being carried, after which the members returned to the mayor and the same of the councillors:\n\nMoved by Coun. Davis and seconded Coun. Sanderson, that reports of committees presented this evening be thrown out as the committees are not legal.\n\nThe mayor ruled this motion out of order for the reason that the committees are legally appointed.\n\nCoun. Davis moved that the report be received.\n\nThe mayor asked for the year and may, when all the councillors voted any; the mayor being absent.\n\nThe motion was then put and carried. All orders for it were from the mayor.\n\nThe following committees were then appointed:\n\nFinance and Assessment\u2014Woodman, Davis, Mair.\n\nBoard of Works\u2014Woodman, Goddard, Mair.\n\nHealth and Relief\u2014Davis, Donaldson, Goddard.\n\nFire, Water and Light\u2014Donaldson, Woodman, Sanderson.\n\nThe mayor reported the action he had taken in connection with gladiolus houses.

Donaldson gave notice that he would introduce a by-law to amend By-law No. 27.\n\nThe following committee were appointed:\n\nJohn Smith\u2014Chairman, John Smith.\n\nThe council then adjourned to meet again on Monday evening next, 4th inst.\n\nTHE HISTORICAL SOCIETY.\n\nA meeting was held in the Nielson Academy on Saturday evening last to consider the advisability of forming a historical and scientific society. Mr. Jacquin presided and explained the object of the meeting. He said that earlier in the year a proposal had been made to form a society connected with St. Paul's Presbyterian Church, but they had decided against it because there was no one having a wider field. They had drafted a constitution to submit to this meeting and had decided that it was necessary to seek assistance to all who were likely to be interested in such an organization. He hoped the society would be formed and that it would be successful.\n\nShort speeches were also made by Capt. Perry, Rev. Canon F. Van, Archdeacon Macdonald, and others, all of whom were in sympathy with the object of the meeting. Mr. W. R. Gurney spoke at length, saying that while he was fully in accord with the object of the meeting and would be glad to do all in his power to make such an organization a success, he thought it would be a mistake to attempt to form a society without a wider field. He thought it would be better to form a society connected with the church, as such a society would be more widely known and would have a larger membership.\n\nThe meeting was adjourned until further notice.\n\nTHE ROYAL BAKING POWDER.\n\nAbsolutely Pure.\n\nFOR SALE OR RENT\n\nTHE LELAND HOUSE\n\nPRINCE ALBERT.\n\nOriginating in the olden times, Leland decided to give up the hotel business for the purpose of selling real estate.
