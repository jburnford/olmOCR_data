T. SMALL, M.A.,\n\nBARRISTER-AT-LAW\n\nUNDER THE DIRECTION OF\n\nFREDERIC CUMBERLAND, Esq.\n\nMANAGING DIRECTOR.\n\nToronto:\n\nPRINTED BY HUNTER, ROSE & CO., 25 WELLINGTON STREET.\n\n1876.\nPREFACE.\n\nDuring the last Session of the Dominion Parliament, two Special Acts relating to the Company were passed. The first of these \"An Act respecting the Lien of the Dominion on the Northern Railway of Canada,\" and the second, \"The Northern Railway Company Act, 1875.\" The greater part of \"The Railway Act, 1868,\" its amendments and some general Acts respecting Railways are incorporated in this latter Act by mere reference; so that, in order to ascertain the state of the law affecting the Company it was necessary to examine the statute books of many years. It was therefore thought expedient to arrange, for the use of the Company and its officers, all these Acts in the form of a single consolidated enactment with an index. The parts of the general Railway Acts which affect the Company are printed in a smaller type than those of the special Acts of the Company. Wherever changes, rendered necessary in many places for the sake of uniformity, have been made, italics have been used.\n\nThe two above-mentioned special Acts have also been printed separately; the former will be found at page ninety-seven, and the latter at page seventy-five of this book.\nA CONSOLIDATION\n\nOF THE\n\nSTATUTES\n\nRELATING TO THE\n\nNorthern Railway Company of Canada.\n\nWHEREAS, for the proper accommodation and development of the traffic of the district served by the Northern Railway Company of Canada, it is necessary to change the gauge of the said railway from five feet six inches to four feet eight and one-half inches, and that additional rolling stock and other equipments should be provided, and additional works and improvements executed on the said railway, and new expenditure on capital account will thereby have to be incurred:\n\nAnd whereas the present share and loan capital of the Northern Railway Company of Canada, hereinafter called \"The Company,\" consists of the following particulars (that is to say):\n\n(a) First preference bonds to the amount of \u00a3250,000 sterling, in bonds of \u00a3100 sterling each;\n\n(b) Second preference bonds to the amount of \u00a3283,900 sterling, in bonds of \u00a3100 sterling each;\n\n(c) Class A, third preference bonds to the amount of \u00a350,000 sterling, in bonds of \u00a3100 sterling each;\n\n(d) Class B, third preference bonds to the amount of \u00a3100,000 sterling, in bonds of \u00a3100 sterling each;\n\n(e) The lien of the Dominion, amounting to \u00a3475,000 sterling;\n\n(f) The share capital of the Company, amounting to \u00a3203,800 currency, divided into 40,760 shares of \u00a35 currency each;\nAnd whereas besides the lien, the Government holds \u00a350,000 in amount, of the said second preference bonds, and \u00a350,000 in amount, of the said Class B, third preference bonds:\n\nAnd whereas by this Act provision is made for the discharge of the lien of the Dominion upon certain conditions and payments to be made by the Company:\n\nAnd whereas to enable the Company to comply with the said conditions and to make such payments to the Government of the Dominion for the discharge of the lien it is necessary to re-adjust the Company's share capital:\n\nAnd whereas, the Company and the Northern Extension Railways Company, hereinafter called \"the Extension Company,\" have presented petitions praying that the railways of the Northern Extension Railways Company may be declared to be works for the general advantage of Canada, and that powers may be granted for the amalgamation of the said companies:\n\nAnd it is expedient that the prayers of the said respective petitions should be granted:\n\nTherefore Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:\u2014\n\nPART I.\n\n1. If the Company or any Company formed by its amalgamation with any other Company under this Act do, on or before the first day of April, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six, or within such extended time as the Governor in Council may grant, not exceeding three months thereafter, pay to the Receiver-General of Canada, or to the financial agents of the Dominion in England, the sum of one hundred thousand pounds sterling, such payment shall operate as a full discharge and release of the said lien and of all principal and interest due in respect thereof, and the Receiver General or the said financial agents (as the case may be) shall give the Company a certificate of such payment, which shall be sufficient evidence of the discharge of the lien and of all claim in respect thereof: Provided always, that the said bonds of the Company held by the Government shall not be affected by the payment aforesaid, but shall hold their present rank and priority in any arrangement that may be made of the affairs of the Company, and that the accrued interest on the second preference bonds shall be paid under the terms of the several repealed Acts relating to the said railway. (38 V. Can. c. 23, s. 1.)\n2. The Directors of the Company shall call a special general meeting of the Company, to be held at Toronto within six months after the eighth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five, to consider the question of the extinguishment of the existing ordinary share capital of the Company, for a price to be paid out of money to be raised by the issue of new stock under this Act, or the commutation of the said ordinary shares into such new stock as aforesaid, such price or such new stock to be accepted by the shareholders in full satisfaction and extinguishment of their respective holding of original shares: And provided such extinguishment of the present ordinary shares for a price stated, or commutation, at a rate and on terms stated, into new stock, be sanctioned by resolution of the Company and affirmed by two-thirds of the votes of the shareholders present or represented at such special general meeting of the Company, to be duly called and held at Toronto within the time aforesaid, the resolution to that effect agreed to and passed as aforesaid, shall be binding upon all the holders of the present share capital of the Company, and upon the Company: And for the purpose of the separate vote of the shareholders among themselves upon the said question of extinguishment or commutation, each and every share in the capital stock of the Company represented at such meeting, shall entitle the holders thereof, to one vote for every such share: Provided always that it shall be lawful for the Company to agree separately with any one or more of the shareholders for the extinguishment or commutation of his or their shares, and in the event of such agreement or agreements taking effect, the shareholder or shareholders so agreeing shall not have any vote at the special general meeting to be held under this section; but such agreement or agreements shall not take effect unless or until the same shall have been sanctioned at the special general meeting by resolution of the Company and affirmed by two-thirds of the votes of the shareholders as aforesaid present or represented as aforesaid, excepting the shareholder or shareholders so agreeing as aforesaid. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 1.)\n\n3. When and so soon as such resolution as in the last preceding section mentioned, has been duly agreed to and passed as aforesaid, there is hereby created, and the Company may properly pass proceedings if the necessary resolution is contained, new ordinary stock of the amount of five hundred thousand pounds sterling, the holders of which shall be entitled to participate rateably one with another in the net profits of the Company, and the said ordinary stock hereby created shall hold, with regard to the bonds of the Company, the same rank and position as the share capital of the Company held before the passing of this Act. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 2.)\n\n4. It shall be lawful for the Directors of the Company to raise by the issue of new ordinary stock, part of that hereby created, at such prices as shall be obtainable for the same, so much money as shall be necessary for discharging the Govern-\nment lien, and, if such extinguishment shall have been agreed upon, for paying off and extinguishing the existing share capital, pursuant to the provisions in that behalf hereinbefore contained; or, in the event of the shareholders having agreed upon the commutation of the original share capital by the exchange thereof for a portion of the new ordinary stock hereby created as hereinbefore provided, it shall be lawful for the Directors, in addition to the issue for discharging the Government lien, to issue a sufficient portion of the said new ordinary stock hereby created, for the purpose of such commutation of the original share capital. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 3.)\n\nResidue of new stock, how disposed of.\n\n5. It shall be lawful for the Directors of the Company to issue for the benefit of the Company, the residue of the new ordinary stock hereby created, at such prices as shall be from time to time obtainable for the same, and in such amounts and on such terms and conditions as the Directors may think proper, and to apply the proceeds of such issues to the general purposes of the Company properly chargeable to capital account: Provided that no new ordinary stock in the excess of the amount required for discharging the Government lien, and extinguishing or commutating the original share capital as herein provided, shall be issued without the previous sanction of a special general meeting of the Company. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 4.)\n\nProviso.\n\nNature of new stock\u2014transfer, &c.\n\n6. The said new ordinary stock shall be, and shall have all the incidents of personal estate, and shall be transmissible and transferable in any quantities not involving fractions of a pound sterling, as nearly as may be in the same manner, and subject to the same regulations as the share capital of the Company has hitherto been. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 5.)\n\nWhen the old stock shall be extinguished.\n\n7. When and so soon as the payment shall have been made, as hereinbefore provided in discharge of the lien of the Government, and the aforesaid agreement for purchase or commutation of the original share capital shall have been carried out by the Company, the share capital of the Company heretofore existing shall be extinguished. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 6.)\n\nProvision in case of failure to carry out the foregoing arrangement.\n\n8. In the event of no arrangement being made and agreed to by the holders of the present share capital for the extinguishment or commutation thereof under the provisions of and within the time limited by the second section of this Act, then and thereafter the provisions hereinbefore made for the issue of new ordinary stock shall be void and of no effect, and then, but not otherwise, the six following sections shall have effect. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 7.)\n\nPreferential stock may be issued\u2014its rank and privileges.\n\n9. There is hereby created, and the Company may issue pursuant to the provisions in that behalf hereinafter contained, preferential stock to the amount of three hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling, and the said preferential stock hereby created shall hold with regard to the bonds and ordinary\nshare capital of the Company, he same rank and position as the lien of the Dominion held at the time of the passing of this Act; and the holders of the preferential stock hereby created, or of so much thereof as may from time to time be issued under the provisions herein contained, shall be entitled to receive out of the net profits of the Company interest at the rate of six per cent. per annum upon such preferential stock, before any dividends or interest whatever shall become payable out of the profits of the Company upon the said existing ordinary share capital; and if at any time hereafter, any surplus revenue applicable to dividend shall remain after the said ordinary stock has received six per cent. dividend, then such surplus shall be divided rateably between the holders of the said preferential and ordinary stock. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 8.)\n\n10. It shall be lawful for the Directors of the Company to raise by the issue of preferential stock, part of that hereby created, at such prices as shall be obtainable for the same, so much money as shall be necessary for discharging the Government lien pursuant to the provisions in that behalf hereinbefore contained, and the first charge upon the proceeds of such preferential stock shall be the payment to the Government of the Dominion of the amount required for the discharge of the Government lien. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 9.)\n\n11. It shall be lawful for the Directors of the Company to issue for the benefit of the Company the residue of the preferential stock hereby created, at such prices as shall be from time to time obtainable for the same, and in such amounts as the Directors may think proper, and to apply the proceeds of such issues to the general purposes of the Company properly chargeable to capital account; Provided, that no preferential stock in excess of the amount required for discharging the Government lien, as herein provided, shall be issued without the previous sanction of a special general meeting of the Company. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 10.)\n\n12. The said preferential stock shall be and shall have all the incidents of personal estate, and shall be transmissible and transferable in any quantities, not involving fractions of a pound sterling, as nearly as may be in the same manner and subject to the same regulations as the share capital of the Company has hitherto been. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 11.)\n\n13. No share heretofore existing in the capital of the Company shall be transferred after the thirtieth June or thirty-first December next following the date when the payment to extinguish the lien of the Dominion shall have been made, but immediately after such thirtieth June or thirty-first December, all currency scrip issued in respect of such share capital shall be cancelled, and every corporation or person registered as a shareholder at that date, or then entitled to be so registered by virtue of a transfer previously executed, shall be registered for Transfer of currency\nan amount of sterling stock, at the rate of four pounds sterling for every existing registered share of five pounds currency, the certificates for which sterling stock shall be issued in exchange for the surrender of the certificates or scrip of the currency shares; and upon such exchange being effected, and from the date thereof, the said sterling stock shall stand in all respects in the rank and position of the said currency shares for which it shall have been exchanged. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 12.)\n\n14. The benefit of the exchange provided by the next preceding section shall not extend to any share in respect of which no claim to it, which shall ultimately be found to be valid, shall have been made within two years, from the thirtieth June, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five, at the office of the Company either at Toronto or in London, England; but at the expiration of the said time all such shares shall be extinguished for the benefit of the Company, and all dividends accrued due or payable on the stock which was issuable in respect thereof, shall be forfeited to the Company. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 13.)\n\n15. In case the Corporation of the said City of Toronto, or of the County of Simcoe, do in proper form of law effectually release to the Company their said shares in the Capital Stock of the said Company, the said shares shall no longer be included in the shares of the Capital Stock dealt with in the preceding provisions of this Act, but this shall not affect the right of the said Corporations to be represented upon the Board under this Act. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 14.)\n\n16. The Company shall have power to change the gauge of its railway, or any line of railway leased to the Company or belonging to a Company amalgamated with it, to the width of four feet and eight and one-half inches. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 15.)\n\nPART II.\n\n17. The railways of the Northern Extension Railways Company, hereinafter called the Extension Company, are hereby declared to be works for the general advantage of Canada; and the expression \"The Company\" in this Act shall mean the Northern Railway Company of Canada, as well after as before the amalgamation, and the corporate name of the Company shall remain what it now is. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 16.)\n\n18. It shall be lawful for the Company and the Extension Company, at any time after the passing of this Act, to enter into an agreement for amalgamation upon such terms, conditions and stipulations as may be therein set forth, and sealed with their respective common seals, and approved in extraordinary general meetings of the respective Companies, specially called for the purpose, by resolution, for which not less than two-thirds of the votes of the persons present or represented at such respective meetings shall have been given in the affirm-\nNorthern Railway of Canada.\n\native, but so that such agreement shall contain provisions to the following effect:\n\n1. The franchise or charter of the Extension Company, with all its powers, authorities, rights, and privileges, and all its railways, plant and undertaking, with all its property, real and personal, shall be transferred to and vested in the Company, and the members of the Extension Company shall thenceforth be members of the body corporate of the Company: Provided always, that the Company, and the undertaking and works thereof, shall continue liable upon all covenants and agreements in respect of the bonds of the Extension Company in the same manner and to the same extent as if such amalgamation had not taken place, and the holders of such bonds shall retain their bonds with the same charge on the undertaking and railways late of the Extension Company, and with the same rights and privileges in all respects including the same conditional right in the Company of voting and qualifying as Directors, as under the twenty-eighth section of the Act of the Legislature of Ontario, thirty-five Victoria, chapter forty-three,(a) as if the amalgamation had not taken place, and as if this Act had not been passed: and any debt due to the Company from the Extension Company, or from the Extension Company to the Company, shall merge and be extinguished. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 17, sub. 1.)\n\n2. The benefit of the franchise or charter of the Extension Company, with all its powers, authorities, rights, and privileges to be transferred under the powers of this Act, and the railways, plant and undertaking, and all the property, real and personal, of the Extension Company shall be deemed and taken to be worth when cleared of all debts and other liabilities in any way whatever embraced in the capital and construction accounts of the Extension Company, and when cleared of its debenture debt, a sum not exceeding four thousand one hundred and nine pounds sterling for every mile of the railways of the Extension Company from Barrie to Gravenhurst in the one direction, and from Collingwood to Meaford in the other direction; and such mileage shall be ascertained by the result of an actual survey and admeasurement of the railways when completed; and from the sum agreed to as the sum (not exceeding four thousand one hundred and nine pounds sterling per mile) for which the said Extension Railway may be purchased by the Company, all such debts and liabilities including the said debenture debt and the amount necessary for completing the said railway to Gravenhurst, shall be deducted, and the balance only shall be payable to the shareholders of the Extension Company in the new ordinary or preferential stock of the Company, as the case may be, and thereupon after such amalgamation and payment the share capital of the Extension Company shall be extinguished. Provided that in no event Proviso:\n\n(a) See sec. 83.\nAmount not to exceed paid up capital of Extension Company, and interest and premium.\n\nshall the amount so to be paid by the Company to the shareholders of the Extension Company for the purchase and extinguishment of their shares exceed in the aggregate the amount of the share capital of the Extension Company actually and bona fide paid up in cash before the commencement of the session of the Parliament of Canada held in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five, with interest thereon at the rate of ten per centum per annum, from the date of the respective payments, and a premium not exceeding twelve and one-half per centum upon such paid up stock. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 17, sub. 2.)\n\nAmalgamated Company to pay debts of Extension Company.\n\n3. All debts due from, liabilities of, and contracts subsisting with the Extension Company, shall become debts due from, liabilities of, and contracts subsisting with the Company, and all rights of action and suit which shall have accrued to or against the Extension Company shall ensue and subsist for the benefit of and against the Company, and there shall be no abatement of any action or suit which shall have been commenced by or against the Extension Company; but any such action or suit may, upon a suggestion of the amalgamation effected under the provisions of this Act, be continued and prosecuted by or against the Company in the same way as it would have been continued and prosecuted by or against the Extension Company if such amalgamation had not been effected. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 17, sub. 3.)\n\nCompany may issue new stock up to \u00a350,000.\n\n19. The Company shall be empowered to issue for the purposes of amalgamation on the terms limited by this Act, and so far as not required for that purpose for any object within the charters of either of the amalgamated Companies, additional, new ordinary or preferential stock, as the case may be, to an amount not exceeding fifty thousand pounds sterling beyond the amounts hereinbefore limited as to such stocks respectively, irrespective of amalgamation.

(38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 19.)\n\nLoan capital of Extension Company to form part of that of Amalgamated Company.\n\n21. After such amalgamation the loan capital of the Extension Company shall be added to and form part of the loan capital of the Company, and the Company shall have the same powers from time to time of issuing, selling, or pledging bonds of the Company, and to the same extent and with the same privileges or priorities as to the undertaking and property belonging before the amalgamation to the Extension Company.\nas the Extension Company would have had as to bonds of that Company, if such amalgamation had not been effected, (a) and may upon the maturity of any bonds the Extension Company issued previously to the amalgamation, or of any further bonds issued under the authority of this section, raise the sums required for paying off the matured bonds or any part of such sums, either out of any fund of the Company applicable to capital services (whether arising from the issue of ordinary or preferential stock under the powers herein contained, or arising otherwise), or by issuing, selling, or pledging other bonds of the Company bearing interest at any rate not exceeding six per cent. per annum, at such price and upon such terms and conditions as the Directors of the Company may think fit; and the bonds upon the security of which any sums required for paying off the respective matured bonds shall be raised, may to the amount of the respective matured bonds, but not further or otherwise, be so issued as to take the place of and be entitled to the respective privileges and priorities attached to the respective matured bonds for or towards paying off which such sums respectively shall have been raised, or may be issued, with such other privileges and priorities not limiting, restricting, or prejudicially affecting the rights of holders of then existing bonds, or without any preference or priority, as the Directors of the Company shall think fit. (38 V. Can. c. 65, s. 20.)\n\n22. Until the first general meeting of the Company, held after the date of the amalgamation, three of the Directors of the Extension Company, to be nominated by the Board of the Extension Company as existing at the date of the amalgamation, shall act as Interim Directors of the Company, in addition to the other Directors of the Company under this Act.

(35 V. Ont. c. 43, s. 13.)\n\n26. The by-laws heretofore passed in aid of the North Grey Railway Company, by the Townships of Collingwood, Euphrasia and St. Vincent, are hereby confirmed, so far as relates to the omission to insert therein a specific day for the same to take effect.

Can. c. 68, s. 9, sub. 18.)\n\n19.

Can. c. 68, s. 9, sub. 19.)\n\n20.

Ont. c. 15, s. 1.)\n\n22. The same fee shall be payable for such subpoenas as in the case of subpoenas issued out of such Superior Court in civil cases, and the witness shall be entitled to the like conduct money; (38 V. Ont. c. 15, s. 2.)\n23. The depositions of witnesses examined before such Arbitrators shall be taken down in writing, and shall forthwith after the making of their award, together with the exhibits referred to therein, and all other papers connected with the reference except the award, be delivered or by registered letter transmitted by the Arbitrators to the Clerk of Records and Writs of the Court of Chancery, with appropriate stamps, and shall be filed by such Clerk with the Records of the Court; (38 V. Ont. c. 15, s. 3.)\n\n24. Any party to such arbitration may, within one month after receiving a written notice from one of the Arbitrators of the making of the award, appeal therefrom upon any question of law or fact to a Judge of any of the Superior Courts of Law or Equity, and upon the hearing of such appeal, such Judge shall, if the same be a question of fact, decide the same upon the evidence as in a case of original jurisdiction; (38 V. Ont. c. 15, s. 4.)\n\n25. Upon any such appeal the practice and proceedings shall be, as near as may be, the same as upon an appeal from a decision of the Judge of the County Court in Insolvency; (38 V. Ont. c. 15, s. 5.)\n\n26. The right of appeal hereby given shall not affect the existing law or practice as to setting aside awards; (38 V. Ont. c. 15, s. 6.)\n\n27. A majority of the Arbitrators at the first meeting after their appointment, or the sole arbitrator, shall fix a day on or before which the award shall be made, and if the same is not made on or before such day or some other day to which the time for making it has been prolonged, either by the consent of the parties or by resolution of the Arbitrators, then, the sum offered by the company as aforesaid shall be the compensation to be paid by them; (31 V. Can., c. 68, s. 9, sub. 21.)\n\n28. If the sole Arbitrator appointed by the Judge, or the Official Arbitrator appointed by the Minister of Public Works, or any Arbitrator appointed by the parties, dies before the award has been made, or is disqualified, or refuses or fails to act within a reasonable time, then, in the case of the sole Arbitrator, the Judge, upon the application of either party, and in the case of the Official Arbitrator, the Minister of Public Works, upon a like application, the Judge or Minister being satisfied by affidavit or otherwise of such death, disqualification, refusal or failure, may appoint another Arbitrator in his place, and in the case of any Arbitrator appointed by the parties the Company and party respectively may each appoint an Arbitrator in the place of his Arbitrator so deceased or not acting, but no recommencement or repetition of prior proceedings shall be required in any case; (31 V. Can. c. 68, s. 9, sub. 22.)\n\n29. Any such notice for lands, as aforesaid, may be desisted from, and new notice given, with regard to the same or other lands, to the same or any other party, but in any such case, the liability to the party first notified for all damages or costs by him incurred in consequence of such first notice and desistment, shall subsist; (31 V. Can. c. 68, s. 9, sub. 23.)\n30. The Surveyor or other person offered or appointed as Valuator or Surveyor or as sole Arbitrator, shall not be disqualified by reason that he is professionally employed by either party, or that he has previously expressed an opinion as to the amount of compensation, or that he is related personally or of kin to any member of the Company, provided he is not himself interested.\n\nNo cause of disqualification shall be urged against any Arbitrator appointed by the Judge, after his appointment, but the objection must be made before the appointment, and its validity or invalidity shall be summarily determined by the Judge; (31 V. Can. c. 68, s. 9, sub. 24.)\n\n31. No cause of disqualification shall be urged against any Arbitrator appointed by the Company or by the opposite party after the appointment of a third Arbitrator; and the validity or invalidity of any cause of disqualification urged against any such Arbitrator before the appointment of a third Arbitrator, shall be summarily determined by the Judge, on the application of either party, after two clear days' notice to the other, and if the cause is determined to be valid, the appointment shall be null, and the party offering the person so adjudged to be disqualified shall be held not to have appointed an Arbitrator; (31 V. Can. c. 68, s. 9, sub. 25.)\n\n32. No award shall be invalidated from any want of form or other technical objection, if the requirements of this Act have been complied with, and if the award state clearly the sum awarded, and the lands or other property, right or thing for which such sum is to be the compensation; nor shall it be necessary that the party or parties to whom the sum is to be paid be named in the award; (31 V. Can. c. 68, s. 9, sub. 26.)\n\n33. Upon payment or legal tender of the compensation or annual rent so awarded or agreed upon to the party entitled to receive the same, or upon the deposit of the amount of such compensation in the manner hereinafter mentioned, the award or agreement shall vest in the Company the power forthwith to take possession of the lands, or to exercise the right, or to do the thing for which such compensation or annual rent has been awarded or agreed upon; and if any resistance or forcible opposition be made by any person to their so doing, the Judge may, on proof to his satisfaction of such award or agreement, issue his warrant to the Sheriff of the District or County, or to a Bailiff, as he may deem most suitable, to put the Company in possession, and to put down such resistance or opposition, which the Sheriff or Bailiff, taking with him sufficient assistance, shall accordingly do; (31 V. Can. c. 68, s. 9, sub. 27.)\n\n34. (a) Such Warrant may also be granted by any such Judge, without such award or agreement, on affidavit to his satisfaction that the immediate possession of the lands, or of the power to do the thing mentioned in the notice, is necessary to carry on some part of the Railway with which the Company are ready forthwith to proceed; and upon the Company giving security to his satisfaction, and in a sum which shall not be less than double the amount mentioned in the notice, to pay or deposit the compensation to be awarded within one month after the making of the award, with interest from the time at\n\n(a) This and the following sub-section must be read together.\nwhich possession is given, and with such costs as may be lawfully payable by the Company; (31 V. Can. c. 68, s. 9, sub. 28.)\n\n35.

Can. c. 24, s. 3.)\n\n36. The compensation for any lands which might be taken without the consent of the proprietor shall stand in the stead of such lands; and any claim to or incumbrance upon the said lands, or any portion thereof, shall, as against the Company, be converted into claim to the compensation, or to a like proportion thereof, and they shall be responsible accordingly whenever they have paid such compensation or any part thereof to a party not entitled to receive the same, saving always their recourse against such party; (31 V. Can. c. 68, s. 9, sub. 29.)\n\n37. If the Company has reason to fear any claims or incumbrances, or if any party to whom the compensation or annual rent, or any part thereof is payable, refuses to execute the proper conveyance and guarantee, or if the party entitled to claim the same cannot be found, or is unknown to the Company, or if for any other reason the Company deems it advisable, the Company may pay such compensation into the office of one of the Superior Courts with the interest thereon for six months, and may deliver to the Clerk of the Court an authentic copy of the conveyance, or of the award or agreement if there be no conveyance, and such award or agreement shall thereafter be deemed to be the title of the Company to the land therein mentioned; (31 V. Can. c. 68, s. 9, sub. 30.)\n\n38.

If such order of distribution be obtained in less than six months from the payment of the compensation into Court, the Court shall direct a proportionate part of the interest to be returned to the Company, and if from any error, fault or neglect of the Company it is not obtained until after the six months have expired, the Court shall order the Company to pay to the proper claimants the interest for such further period as may be right; (31 V. Can. c. 68, s. 9, sub. 33.)\n\n41.

The substance of any such By-law when approved as aforesaid if it affects any officer or servant of the Company may be proved by proving the delivery of a copy to, or its receipt by such officer or servant, and if it affects any other Railway Company using the railway shall be painted on boards or printed on paper and pasted on boards and hung up and affixed and continued on the front or other conspicuous part of every wharf or station belonging to the Company, according to the nature or subject matter of such By-laws respectively, and so as to give public notice thereof to the parties interested therein, or affected thereby: and such boards shall from time to time be renewed as often as the by-laws thereon or any part thereof shall be obliterated or destroyed, and no penalty imposed by any such By-law shall be recoverable unless the same shall have been published, and kept published in manner aforesaid; (38 V. Can. c. 24, s. 2.)\n\n7. Such By-laws when so confirmed shall be binding upon and be observed by all parties in the third sub-section mentioned, and shall be sufficient to justify all persons acting under the same; and for proof of the publication of any such By-laws affecting only any other railway Company using the railway, it shall be sufficient to prove that a printed paper or painted board, containing a copy of such By-laws, was affixed and continued in manner by this Act directed, and in case of its being afterwards displaced or damaged, then that such paper or board was replaced as soon as conveniently might be; (38 V. Can. c. 24, s. 2.)\n\n122. The Company may by a By-law impose upon any officer, servant, or person who before the contravention of such By-law has had notice thereof and is employed by the Company, a forfeiture to the Company of not less than thirty days' pay of such officer or servant, for any contravention of such By-law, and may retain any\nsuch forfeiture out of the salary or wages of the offender.

The Directors of the Company shall call a special general meeting of the Company, to be held at Toronto within six months after the passing of this Act, to consider the question of the extinguishment of the existing ordinary share capital of the Company, for a price to be paid out of money to be raised by the issue of new stock under this Act, or the commutation of the said ordinary shares into such new stock as aforesaid\u2014such price or such new stock to be accepted by the shareholders in full satisfaction and extinguishment of their respective holdings of original shares: And provided such extinguishment of the present ordinary shares for a price stated, or commutation, at a rate and on terms stated, into new stock, be sanctioned by resolution of the Company and affirmed by two-thirds of the votes of the shareholders present or represented at such special general meeting of the Company, to be duly called and held at Toronto within the time aforesaid, the resolution to that effect agreed to and passed as aforesaid, shall be binding upon all the holders of the present share capital of the Company, and upon the Company: And for the purpose of the separate vote of the shareholders attending such meeting, the share capital of the Company shall be deemed to consist of two classes of shares, viz., one class of shares representing the capital of the Company, and another class of shares representing the capital of the Extension Company, and the holders of the former class of shares shall be entitled to vote thereon separately from the holders of the latter class of shares.\nshareholders among themselves upon the said question of extinguishment or commutation, each and every share in the capital stock of the Company represented at such meeting, shall entitle the holders thereof, to one vote for every such share: Provided always that it shall be lawful for the Company to agree separately with any one or more of the shareholders for the extinguishment or commutation of his or their shares, and in the event of such agreement or agreements taking effect the shareholder or shareholders so agreeing shall not have any vote at the special general meeting to be held under this section; but such agreement or agreements shall not take effect unless or until the same shall have been sanctioned at the special general meeting by resolution of the Company and affirmed by two-thirds of the votes of the shareholders as aforesaid present or represented as aforesaid, excepting the shareholder or shareholders so agreeing as aforesaid.\n\n2. When and so soon as such resolution as in the last preceding section mentioned, has been duly agreed to and passed as aforesaid, there is hereby created, and the Company may properly pass issue, pursuant to the provisions in that behalf hereinafter contained, new ordinary stock of the amount of five hundred thousand pounds sterling, the holders of which shall be entitled to participate rateably one with another in the net profits of the Company; and the said ordinary stock hereby created shall hold, with regard to the bonds of the Company, the same rank and position as the share capital of the Company held before the passing of this Act.\n\n3. It shall be lawful for the Directors of the Company to raise by the issue of new ordinary stock, part of that hereby created, at such prices as shall be obtainable for the same, so much money as shall be necessary for discharging the Government lien, and, if such extinguishment shall have been agreed upon, for paying off and extinguishing the existing share capital, pursuant to the provisions in that behalf hereinbefore contained; or, in the event of the shareholders having agreed upon the commutation of the original share capital by the exchange thereof for a portion of the new ordinary stock hereby created as hereinbefore provided, it shall be lawful for the Directors, in addition to the issue for discharging the Government lien, to issue a sufficient portion of the said new ordinary stock hereby created, for the purpose of such commutation of the original share capital.\n\n4. It shall be lawful for the Directors of the Company to issue for the benefit of the Company, the residue of the new ordinary stock hereby created, at such prices as shall be from time to time obtainable for the same, and in such amounts and on such terms and conditions as the Directors may think proper, and to apply the proceeds of such issues to the general purposes of the Company properly chargeable to capital account: Provided that no new ordinary stock in excess of the proviso.\namount required for discharging the Government lien, and extinguishing or commutating the original share capital as herein provided, shall be issued without the previous sanction of a special general meeting of the Company.\n\n5. The said new ordinary stock shall be, and shall have all the incidents of personal estate, and shall be transmissible and transferable in any quantities not involving fractions of a pound sterling, as nearly as may be in the same manner, and subject to the same regulations as the share capital of the Company has hitherto been.\n\n6. When and so soon as the payment shall have been made, as hereinbefore provided in discharge of the lien of the Government, and the aforesaid agreement for purchase or commutation of the original share capital shall have been carried out by the Company, the share capital of the Company heretofore existing shall be extinguished.\n\n7. In the event of no arrangement being made and agreed to by the holders of the present share capital for the extinguishment or commutation thereof under the provisions of and within the time limited by the first section of this Act, then and thereafter the provisions hereinbefore made for the issue of new ordinary stock shall be void and of no effect, and then, but not otherwise, the six following sections shall have effect.\n\n8. There is hereby created, and the Company may issue pursuant to the provisions in that behalf hereinafter contained, preferential stock to the amount of three hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling; and the said preferential stock hereby created shall hold with regard to the bonds and ordinary share capital of the Company, the same rank and position as the lien of the Dominion held at the time of the passing of this Act: and the holders of the preferential stock hereby created, or of so much thereof as may, from time to time, be issued under the provisions herein contained, shall be entitled to receive out of the net profits of the Company interest at the rate of six per cent. per annum upon such preferential stock, before any dividends or interest whatever shall become payable out of the profits of the Company upon the said existing ordinary share capital; and if at any time hereafter, any surplus revenue applicable to dividend shall remain after the said ordinary stock has received six per cent. dividend, then such surplus shall be divided rateably between the holders of the said preferential and ordinary stock.\n\n9. It shall be lawful for the Directors of the Company to raise by the issue of preferential stock, part of that hereby created, at such prices as shall be obtainable for the same, so much money as shall be necessary for discharging the Government lien pursuant to the provisions in that behalf hereinbefore contained, and the first charge upon the proceeds of such\npreferential stock shall be the payment to the Government of the Dominion of the amount required for the discharge of the Government lien.\n\n10. It shall be lawful for the Directors of the Company to issue for the benefit of the Company the residue of the preferential stock hereby created, at such prices as shall be from time to time obtainable for the same, and in such amounts as the Directors may think proper, and to apply the proceeds of such issues to the general purposes of the Company properly chargeable to capital account: Provided, that no preferential stock in excess of the amount required for discharging the Government lien, as herein provided, shall be issued without the previous sanction of a special general meeting of the Company.\n\n11. The said preferential stock shall be and shall have all Nature and incidents of personal estate, and shall be transmissible and transferable in any quantities, not involving fractions of a pound sterling, as nearly as may be in the same manner and subject to the same regulations as the share capital of the Company has hitherto been.\n\n12. No share heretofore existing in the capital of the Company shall be transferred after the thirtieth June or thirty-first December next following the date when the payment to extinguish the lien of the Dominion shall have been made, but immediately after such thirtieth June or thirty-first December, all currency scrip issued in respect of such share capital shall be cancelled; and every corporation or person registered as a shareholder at that date, or then entitled to be so registered by virtue of a transfer previously executed, shall be registered for an amount of sterling stock, at the rate of four pounds sterling for every existing registered share of five pounds currency,\u2014the certificates for which sterling stock shall be issued in exchange for the surrender of the certificates or scrip of the currency shares; and upon such exchange being effected, and from the date thereof, the said sterling stock shall stand in all respects in the rank and position of the said currency shares for which it shall have been exchanged.\n\n13. The benefit of the exchange provided by the next preceding section shall not extend to any share in respect of which no claim to it, which shall ultimately be found to be valid, shall have been made within two years, from the thirtieth June, or the thirty-first December (as the case may be) next following the passing of this Act, at the office of the Company either at Toronto or in London, England; but at the expiration of the said time all such shares shall be extinguished for the benefit of the Company, and all dividends accrued, due or payable on the stock which was issuable in respect thereof, shall be forfeited to the Company.\nProvision to shares held by Toronto and Simcoe.\n\n14.

The Company shall have power to change the gauge of its railway, or any line of railway leased to the Company or belonging to a Company amalgamated with it, to the width of four feet and eight and one-half inches.\n\nPART II.\n\nNorthern Extension Railways' works for benefit of Canada.\n\n16.
