He spoke of the line between Brandon and the Saskatahene boundary, which he said, seems to have lost sight of the fact that in applying for the Grand Trunk Western line he was losing time. The Local Govern- ment Board has already told him that it was not proper to push the limit of its power until it knew whether such a line would be served by the Dominion Government, so the questions now raised by the Jum der Union, if they are really raised, are whether such a line will be served, or is it going to be pushed beyond the limit of the rights of the Dominion, and if it is not, why not? Is the idea of a split city going to be pushed? Are they going to give up the fact that the Dominion does not want to handle the matter? If they do give it up, what is the theory behind this? It is not practical, and the sooner we get away from the idea that it is going to be a split city, and once the shape of things, that much will be done toward settling the matter.\n\nIt was suggested that a resolution be moved that the Union do all in its power to oppose any attempt to split the City into the two sides, but Mr. Parry said that all such resolutions were futile unless they were backed up by other resolutions.\n\nThe House adjourned.\n\nTHE WINNIPEG TIMES AND PROPOSED ROCK LAKE AND BRANDON R.R.\n\nThe Winnipeg Times, in its issue of Thursday, December 6th, informed our readers that the Chicoutimi Railway Company had completed the track and that the line would be opened for traffic on December 31st, 1897.\n\nTHE RAISIN TRADE.\n\nA great many complaints are being made about the raising of prices for raisins. It is alleged that the merchants are charging exorbitant prices for these fruits. A meeting of the raisin growers has been called to discuss the matter.\nNOMINATION\nFOR\nCIVIC ELECTIONS\n1885.\nCITY OF BRANDON.\n\nNotice\n\nIt is hereby notified, that a meeting of the citizens of the City of Brandon will be held at the City Hall, on Monday, December 1st, 1885.\n\nE.

We found her on the bench and brought her here. She seems to be in great pain.\"\n\nThe woman sat on a bench in the entryway of the building, her head bowed, her hands clasped behind her back. Her dress was torn at the knee; her shoes were very faded; there stood on the ground near her feet a small child.\n\n\"Does she belong to you?\" asked the judge.\n\n\"I believe she does,\" replied the officer, not seeming to care.\n\n\"No! You're lying!\" cried the child, jumping down.\n\n\"Nay, not now,\" said the judge, raising his hand. \"Go on with your work. I will hear you when you are done.\"\n\nThe woman continued to sit, her eyes fixed on the ground.\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" she asked, her voice wavering.\n\n\"I want you to go back to your husband,\" said the judge, sternly.\n\n\"He wouldn't let me work for him,\" she replied, tears streaming down her face.\n\n\"He has no right to keep you from working,\" said the judge, firmly.\n\n\"But he's cruel!\" cried the woman, clutching at the child.\n\n\"I'm sure he's not,\" replied the judge, dismissively. \"Go back to your work.\"\n\nThe woman sighed, stood up, and walked away. The child followed, crying softly.\n\nINDIAN GIRLS.\n\nAs an example of their docility, even when faced with the loss of their family, these girls prove their adaptability. One girl, found wandering in the street, was seen by a passing Indian woman who approached her and offered her some food. The child accepted the food, smiled, and disappeared into a nearby alley. Another was found crying in a doorway, surrounded by a group of Indians who gave her food and comfort. Despite the trials and tribulations they face daily, these girls maintain their sense of dignity and resilience.\n\nJersey Beauties.\n\nThere are spots as much more enchanting than Jersey. Let them have a word to the beauty-loving stranger.\n\nA Ride for Life.\n\nA Man Switched on a Brand Finished Saturday.\n\nOn Monday, December 9th, 1867, a man was spotted riding a bicycle in the streets of New York City. He wore a dark suit and a bowler hat. Onlookers watched in awe as this daring new mode of transportation transformed city streets into open highways for the first time in history.\n\nMIXED FARMING.\n\nCalifornia papers are urging the farmers of the coast to increase their farming and begin growing more crops. The state has an abundance of these things in its vast farmlands, so large quantities of produce can be marketed in the coming years.\n\nTHE BRANDON WEEKLY MAIL\n\nLETTER TO FARMERS.\n\nWhat May Be Done for the Right Ambition Farmer?\n\nMr. Pond Replies.\n\nNearly two weeks ago, Mr. Pond posted a letter to his subscribers about what farmers could do to improve their situation. It remains to be seen how many farmers read and responded to his suggestions.\n\nOld-fashioned Farmer.\n\nAn Old-fashioned farmer was visiting his young relative in North Carolina. His old friend looked around the house and commented, \"This place is just like my old house back home.\"\nAT SAN JACINTO.\n\nHow Texas Was Captured and Held\u2014General.\n\nAn aged Texas warrior's reminiscences of the War for the Independence of Texas.\n\nThe Commercial Gazette has the following account of an interview with Mr. Hopson, who was an active participant in the battle of San Jacinto, and who has been engaged in the business of tailoring for many years. He was present at the battle of San Jacinto, and his recollection of the events of that day are still vivid in his mind.\n\nMr. Hopson describes the scene of the battle as follows:\n\n\"The battle of San Jacinto was fought on April 21st, 1836, near Houston, Texas. The Texans, under the command of General Sam Houston, defeated the Mexicans under General Santa Anna. The battle lasted from sunrise until noon, and ended in a decisive victory for the Texans. The Mexicans lost over 600 men killed and wounded, while the Texans lost only about 15.\"\n\nMr. Hopson also relates how he came to be present at the battle:\n\n\"I was living in Houston at the time of the battle, and I heard about it through the newspapers. I decided to go to the battle, and I set out on horseback early in the morning. I arrived just in time to see the battle begin, and I was able to witness the entire engagement.\"\n\nMr. Hopson goes on to describe the conditions at the battle:\n\n\"The Texans were well armed and well trained, while the Mexicans were poorly equipped and ill-prepared. The Texans were able to take advantage of their superior training and equipment, and they were able to defeat the Mexicans with relative ease.\"\n\nMr. Hopson concludes by saying:\n\n\"It was a great day for Texas, and it will always be remembered as the day when Texas gained its independence. I am proud to have been there, and I am grateful for the opportunity to share my experiences with others.\"\n\nTHE TORONTO STORE\n\nSELLING OUT.\n\nLEAVING BRANDON.\n\nA Great Shantybuilding Sale\u2014over 100,000 worth of Dry Goods, Clothing, Carpets, Blankets, Pots, Pans, Hats and Caps now on sale.\n\nAs we are engaged in business in Ontario, this sale is SQUARE and NO HURRY.\n\nHeaps of Dry Goods\n\nTo Whom From\u2014Large Stock of Plain and Brocade Silks for Ladies and Men.\n\n100 pieces Dress Goods, from $1.00.\n\n20 pieces Grey and Plain Wool Foursuits, yellow coat, $1.00.\n\n75 Ladies Shawls and Jackets, at half price.\n\nAll goods marked down from 25% to 50%.\n\nCAR LOADS OF CROCEIES.\n\nFresh Fruit from $1.00, Fish from $1.00, Eggs from $1.00, Butter from $1.00, Flour from $1.00.\n\nCome early and take advantage of this Great Sale.

CROSSLEY, 9th Street.\n\nBlood Bitters\n\nBitters\nPRIME RANGERS.\n\nBufflehead, or Black-necked Nasty Kestrel.\n\nThere are not many instances of the prairie's most common birds of bison, hawks and elk that once \"shook the earth\" in the province. Are they extinct? No, not yet. They are in better shape than ever before, and are now an object of deep interest. Last Friday morning, a fine specimen of the rarest moose, that had been shot in the vicinity of Brandon, was found. All day long the body was surrounded by wondering crowds, who truly felt that they had seen a sight of a passing nature. There lay the last survivor of a race which, some years ago, found an asylum in the province. The animal was killed at the age of twelve years, and the greatest wonder is that it should have lived so long. It is not impossible, that his mate, a very rare species, will soon join him.\n\nMUSICAL.\n\nThe members of the L.O.A.S. have arranged for a grand concert on the evening of the 21st inst., and have secured the best talent of Winnipeg. A sufficient guarantee of the excellence of the performers is given by the fact that they are engaged to accompany the Civic Band, and will be heard in the concert hall at 8 o'clock. The programme will consist of selections from the operas of Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini, and others, as well as selections from the works of Mendelssohn, Schumann, and other composers.\n\nCIVIC ELECTIONS.\n\nThe nominations took place on Monday last, Mr. Clark Macdonald being elected. As a result, Mr. Macdonald, candidate for alderman, was nominated for the position of mayor. The election was held at the City Hall, and the result was announced by the Returning Officer.\n\nTHE WALL-PAPER EMPORIUM.\n\nNow open for inspection.\n\n48 Cases Latest Designs in Wall Papers\n\nAt prices to suit all.\n\nWholesale and Retail.\n\nW.
