B.F.

May we suggest under the circumstances that this be purchased locally.\n\nIn regard to Mr. Johnson's tender, may we say that the sub-contract for the Sarcee Day School only was $1400.00, and we consider Mr. Johnson's bid a very fair one, and would so recommend. We feel that he will do a good job on both buildings.\n\nMay we say that both buildings are progressing, with some delay over labour and rains, but we rushing the job for opening of school around the first week in September. Road and bridge conditions have not helped us in the supply of materials, but this is now in hand. The buildings may say look very good to the writer, and certainly are of solid construction.\n\nJohn. Pugh, Supt.,\nStony - Sarcee Indian Agencies.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\nAttention: Col. B.F. Neary.\nRe: Out-Buildings, Big Horn Day School.\n\nWith reference to the marginally noted subject matter, may we refer you to Major C.A.F. Clark's report of June 15th, 1948, indicating to you the number, sizes, construction etc. of the buildings at the Big Horn Indian Reserve, Nordegg, Alta.\n\nIn this connection as we are now nearing completion of the two main buildings, namely the school & residence, the out-buildings will require some attention. We note that Major Clark suggested the usual toilet facilities, of which there must be three, residence, boys & girls, and a log building 30' x 20' for sheltering horses or pupils etc.\n\nThe item suggested by Major Clark as to cost was placed at $500.00. We have discussed this matter with Mr. Johnson in charge of construction, and have suggested to him, that the toilets be constructed from scaffolding material for studs etc., and if shiplap available at the end of the main building work, that this be used for sheathing on studs, and to finish the three, it is suggested that we cover the outsides with Cedar imitation log siding, and roof with green asbestos shingles in line with the school roofs.\n\nWe selected places in rear of the buildings, in a slight depression in the terrain, and all will be placed over holes, with the boys and girls toilets screened by trellis from each other and spaced some distance apart.\n\nIn the case of the building, 30' x 20', we have the logs on hand, and it is recommended that this building be on a 4\" concrete floor, with 8\" x 8\" to carry the log walls, and a lean too roof, of 2 x 6 rafters, and roll tar paper roofing in green used to cover on common boards for sheathing, with one door made up from shiplap.\n\nSome part of this building should be used for the storing of Coal, and one end for the storing of supplies for the reserve, and to do so, it is suggested that a partition of shiplap should be installed.\n\nMaterial for the above proposals was not included in Purchase order No. 44774, and while we have not prepared any costs for the above, we are visiting the site next Monday, and will review the material on hand, and consult with Mr. Johnson as to construction costs, and advise by Air Mail. It is however estimated that the cost of material will approximate $450.00. Labour costs will be ascertained and advised as above. The cost of materials will be divided by the use of scaffolding material, and form material, but a great deal of this was used in putting in the insulation for the subfloor in the school, and our figure may be high. We have sufficient cement on hand, not having put in the full sized basement due to rock formation found at excavating the basement.\n\nOver.\nOn our last visit to this job, we endeavoured to ascertain completion costs for labour on the two buildings, and found that work sheets up to date at that time, left us with approximately $450.00 in labour account, with all windows to be framed in, floors to be laid, lining in both buildings, and the chinking of outside walls to be carried out, with cement smoothing finish to basement and foundation walls, and rough estimate to complete the above would be around $1000.00 to $1200.00; further check on this will be made Monday next, and request will then be made for further accounts be Cheque from the \"Rocky Mountain House\" agency.\n\nWe have a very solid job on this school and residence, and attractive looking. The writer has taken some coloured moving pictures of the work as it went along and when completed will forward to you for viewing. They are in 8 M size.\n\nMay we have your advice and suggestions in regard to the outbuildings, please, as we would like to complete all work while we have a crew on hand.\n\nJohn E.

The estimate, based on the wage rates being paid, will require a further amount as stated above, which will not include the proposed erection of the shed as covered in our letter of 27th instant. For this work it is estimated that a sum of $350.00 for labour and approximately $250.00 for material, requisitions to cover this material attached, should the Branch authorize this shed being built.\n\nWe may say that we are a little disappointed at the progress being made in the finishing work as to labour, and we have asked Mr Johnson to speed his work up, consistent with workmanship, and his date line was given as above, i.e.: Sept 20th next, for the school and residence.\n\nMay we ask that the Accountable Cheque as noted in the first paragraph be forwarded as soon as possible, please.

This account represented purchases under Purchase Order No 41088, File 91638-4-3, dated April 1st last.\n\nWhen checking into this matter, the writer who prepared and forwarded the above Voucher, found several errors in extensions at the time and changed the total of Mr Bruce's account from $1229.67 to $1230.07, and on receipt of your above referenced letter, we re-checked this account and the purchase order above, and again found discrepancies, and as a result we have written to Mr Bruce showing these alterations that will of necessity have to be made, unless the Branch pay the account after a re-check. We have made copies of Mr Bruce's original account, and have made a copy of the Voucher No 322, but we are holding for our files, the last copy of the Bruce written account as rendered to this office on June 4th last.\n\nWe are enclosing a copy of the changes that we found in the above account, which we have mailed to Mr Bruce for his checking purposes. It is also pointed out that attached to the original voucher sent forward, a receipt for $154.30 was attached to cover the hauling charges which were to be prepaid by Mr Bruce.\n\nWe are concerned over the loss of the Voucher, but we are satisfied that same left this office as above. The errors that will be found are contained in both Mr Bruce's account and also in the Purchase Order No 41088, and are:\n\n(over.)\nare:\n\nExtension of 36 pcs of $2 \\times 4 \\times 16$ @ $52.00 .. $22.46.\nnot $22.00 as in P/O No 41088.

(267 B Feet.)\n\nThe total of Voucher No 322, should read $1231.37,\nas against $1230.07.\n\nWhen the voucher and purchase order in question have\nbeen checked and the figures corrected, may we suggest that\nMr Bruce's account be paid at the corrected figures and Mr\nBruce advised accordingly.\n\nWe regret that we did not carry out a closed check when\nwe rendered this voucher, having failed to check the figures\non the Purchase order which we took as correct.\n\nMay we be advised if our original Voucher is found,\nplease.\n\nJohn E.

Ref Your File 701-1 (E), 4/10/49.\n\nWe have for acknowledgement your above referenced letter, and in reply, it is advised that the writer has just returned from a visit to the above school, and found that all inside work had been completed as to Carpenters work, painting had commenced on the residence, and a start was to be made on the school on Sunday.\n\nThere remains two sets of stair entrances to be made for the residence, which will be completed when the shed which they have commenced has been completed, using up odd material to make these stairs.\n\nThe work performed on these buildings has been good, and the finish work fairly good when one considers that log buildings are not as easy to work as frame. Favourable comments have been made by local and other people on the very presentable buildings erected at this point.\n\nThe latter end of the finishing work has been somewhat slow and the date of September given by Mr Johnson proved too short, the actual finishing date of the two school buildings being Oct 8th. We will provide the photographs as soon as possible as requested.\n\nIn regard to school supplies, we may say that Mr Bulmer has taken up residence at the Big Horn Reserve, and is making himself useful while not teaching school as was hoped on the 3rd, but we did intend opening up on the 17th, this to give time for the painting and floor varnishing to set. No school supplies have been received, and it is now suggested that sufficient supplies for approximately 15 pupils be forwarded, all of which would be for lower grades 1-2-3, and as the writer is now making and has been making almost weekly trips, we will check with Mr Bulmer and make out a requisition for supplies. We say this as we note that you use the word additional school supplies, and we wonder if any supplies have been sent forward, as such have not come to hand.\nto hand:\n\nWe made enquiry at the Railway Station at Nordegg, Canadian National Railway, before leaving on Friday evening. We did not make out any requisition, being under the impression that certain supplies would be sent forward as in the case of the Eden Valley Indian Day School. Would you kindly advise us by wire if supplies have been sent forward at all? We regret the oversight if we should have provided you with requisitions for school supplies.\n\nIn checking over the supplies furnished by the T Eaton Co., of Winnipeg with Mr Bulmer, we noted some damage to certain articles, these included a crack in top plate of the kitchen range, one glass broken in the Dining room china cupboard, a slight tear in the studio lounge, and a slight tear in one mattress. We feel that these happened when hauling form Nordegg to the Big Horn, the roads being very rough and rocky, and being crated inspection was not made at railway point. The damage to the articles is not great, and repairs can be made except in the case of the stove (kitchen), and this is not serious enough to warrant pulling the stove down to effect the repair. Two or three shortages have been noted and these will be dealt with direct with the T Eaton Co., at Winnipeg.\n\nMr Bulmer requested us to furnish blinds for the residence, and curtain rods, and a requisition is being prepared which will be subject to authorization.\n\nStorm Doors were not included in the requisition for materials for the residence and it is recommended that these be provided, of a Combination type, storm and screen, and a requisition will be sent forward to cover this item for your consideration.\n\nAt this time of writing we have not received any further accountable cheque for school labour, and we would ask that this be provided in the amount of $1500.00 for the school & residence, and an amount of $350.00 as authorized for the shed building, and should these amounts not cover the complete job, vouchers will be submitted to cover the concluding work if required.\n\nJohn W.

He also requested an advance of $350.00 for labour, if authorized to erect a shed.\n\nOn September 19th Mr. Pugh advised that the accountable advance of $1500.00 had not been received and we sent an Army Message to you. On September 30th we wrote you from this office because the advance had still not been received by Mr. Pugh. You wired on October 5th asking if the amount requested was a further $1500.00 because you had apparently forwarded an accountable advance in this amount about September 21st. We replied by Army Message that the accountable advance referred to was still the same one originally requested in Mr. Pugh's letter of August 31st.\n\nIn other words, it appears that the accountable advance which you state was sent around September 21st has not been received either at Rocky Mountain House or at the Morley office. Mr. Pugh is presently at Rocky Mountain House and we were in touch with him by phone today. He urgently requires the $1500.00 advance originally requested to complete the school and teacherage, and a further $350.00 advance to complete the shed.\n\nIf the $1500.00 was actually sent on September 21st, I have no idea where it is or where it could be unless it was lost in the mail.\n\nG.

Arrangements are being made to forward Superintendent Pugh an accountable advance of $1,850.00 which it is understood will be the total amount required in connection with labour.\n\nThe delay in sending this advance is due to the fact that we had to transfer funds from another project, as the work at the above school has gone considerably higher than we anticipated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST\nChief, Education Division\n\ncc Supt.

(2) We had difficulty in getting the cement chinking of the logs on the outside to hold, we used metal lath strips, and the cement holds to unite, but where it lapses to the logs, it did not adhered too well, and may have to be gone over later. The lumber co has now agreed to supply us with sash balances at this date, and this we believe is the only item not completed, and when procured, it will be necessary to have Mr Johnson place them in the school cases, and we have left the sash stop partially nailed for this purpose.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn Hugh Scott,\nStony - Sarcee Indian Agency.\nJanuary 6th, 1950.\n\nMr. J.E.

D. McLean\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nSecretary\n\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant re the reopening of the Louis Bull Day School, and to say that this is the first we hear of this school since December 1893. On September 1897 the matter stood as follows: Hon. Mr. Forget then at Hobema was written to the effect that the work of the school was allowed to continue until certain enlargements to the Red Deer School would allow of the children of that reserve to be removed to Red Deer. He was also informed that there was no provision in the estimates for this school, not to mention the purchase of material to finish a winter school for the same band at Pigeon Lake. This was pursuant to Department's letter No. II8151-7 of the 10th of December 1893.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIt would not cost very much to build a boarding school that would accommodate 35 or 40 children. As we have the sawmill here on the reserve, I think that each man that is head of a family would get out 10 logs apiece for lumber. So there are plenty of logs on the Reserve; this would be a great saving in expense.\n\nIs there any law to compel the children to come to school?\n\nIf not, would you pardon a recommendation for every day the children are absent from school but for a good reason, which the teacher should acquaint me or myself with the cause. We charge them cents for each day, and that to the kept off their treaty money, the teacher being present at treaty payment with his school register. I think a small fine would bring them to school more regularly. As it is a shame that a teacher should sit in a school room buried by the gas to teach the children and they will not come. I know I would rather teach 15 or 20 than 5 (or missing 3 or 4). I think it is time for confusion while children have got to go why not the Red.\n\nA. A. Goodhead\nSir,\n\nI have read the contents of the pamphlet regarding tuberculosis. I think that cleanliness is one of the very important things that we need to hang upon our Indian people.\n\nLast summer we adopted the plan of washing the children every Friday afternoon. And we could see a great change in the children, especially did it show itself in the little delicate girl. She is now robust as the others and happy. We wash them in the tub. I wash the boys and my wife the girls. If we had a boarding school so that we had the children all the time, we could keep them clean and healthy. And if we want to save our Indian people, we must save the children.

Dr. Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, has been written to in regard to the unsatisfactory attendance at this school of Indian children and informed that the Department does not see its way clear to continue the school after June 30, next, unless he can show some good reasons to the contrary.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, February 9, 1906.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nThe Department wishes to call your attention to the unsatisfactory attendance at the Louis Bull day school as shown by late returns received. When last inspected there were no Indian children present, although a number of whites are attending the school.\n\nUnless a decided improvement can be had in the attendance of Indian children at this school, the Department does not consider that it would be justified in continuing the grant after June 30, next.\n\nThe white settlers in the neighborhood can secure a school for their children through the provincial authorities, but this Department cannot keep up a school for their benefit.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

Louis Bull Indian Day School.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant #118154/1 referring to the attendance at the Louis Bull Indian Day School at Bear's Hill, Alta. I am writing today to the Chairman of that District, and as soon as his answer is received I will report the facts to the Department for such action as may be deemed advisable.\n\nI have the honor Sir to be,\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir:\n\nWhen I was at the Hobson Indian Agency in December I inquired as to whether the Louis Bull's Day School was yet open and I was informed that it was going to be opened but that it was now closed owing to the fact that most of the Indians were absent, including the school children. Under these conditions I thought it would be a waste of time for me to visit this school.\n\nI perused the last quarterly returns of this school and from them gleaned that there were 14 children living in the vicinity of the school, with 13 of these children enrolled and an average attendance of 4.17 claimed. The total number of days these 14 children made their appearance at the school during the last quarter was reported according to this report to be 180 days. This satisfied me that the school was doing no good. I think the Department should write to Rev Dr Sutherland notifying him that progress could be made under such conditions.\n\nThe Louis Bull School is doing no good. I think the Department should write to Rev Dr Sutherland notifying him that progress could be made under such conditions.\n\nSchool will be closed unless I was informed that Mr. Goodhand has opened a trading post a short distance from the northern boundary of the reserve and that Mrs. Goodhand is now the teacher, i.e., an energetic teacher is secured for it.\n\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nMrs. Goodhand keeps the register and issues the biscuit when the children drop around on occasional days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, January 30, 1907.\n\nRev. Sirs,\n\nIn connection with previous correspondence relative to the Louis Bull day school, I beg to say that from a late report received by the Department it would appear that this school is doing no good under the present teacher and the Indian Commissioner recommends that your attention should be called to the unsatisfactory condition existing there and that the school be closed unless an energetic teacher can be secured for it.\n\nThe last communication received from you on this subject was dated February 13, 1906, in which you mentioned that you were writing to the Chairman of the District and would report the facts to the Department for such action as may be deemed advisable. Since that date no further communication has been received from you, and the Department would like to know what action, if any, your Society is prepared to take with a view to bettering the state of affairs at this school, as it would appear to be useless to carry it on under the present conditions.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.M. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto.\nOttawa, January 30, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Inspector Markle's report on the Louis Bull's day school, and in connection with your marginal note thereon I beg to say that the Rev. Dr. Sutherland has been written to and informed of your views in regard to this school.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D.

The people are very much scattered, and to get anything like a regular or full attendance is impracticable, especially in the winter season. The same difficulty is experienced at Sampson's Reserve, and although the people are being systematically visited by the present teacher, Mr. J.A. Youmans, he finds it exceedingly difficult to keep a Day School in operation.\n\nPerhaps it ought to be said that a further difficulty, and perhaps the chief one, has been caused by the establishment of a Boarding School at Ermineskin's Reserve, while a similar provision for Sampson's and Louis Bull's Reserves has been refused to us. This has caused dissatisfaction among the Indians and a consequent reluctance on their part to send their children to the Day School. Furthermore, they are influenced by rumors current among them, and for which there would seem to be some foundation, that the Department is in favor of Boarding Schools and only Boarding Schools. If the Department is prepared to carry out this policy we are quite prepared to co-operate with it in such cases as White Fish Lake, Battle River, etc.\n\nI will make further enquiry respecting the work of Mr. Goodhand at the Louis Bull School, but I am persuaded that the amount of energy will make the Day School successful under existing conditions.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary, Dept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nA. Butterworth\n\nGeneral Secretary\nOttawa, March 10, 1907.\n\nRev. Sirs,\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Dutherland was written to some time ago regarding the unsatisfactory condition of the Louis Bull day school, and he replied stating that he would make further enquiries respecting the work of Mr. Goodhand. There were no pupils present on the date of the last visit of the Agent and the attendance is very irregular and unsatisfactory.\n\nThe Department would like to have your views as to what could be done to better the condition of affairs there.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.

J. H. Fawcett, seconded by Rev. T.

There are 19 children of school age in that district without educational facilities of any kind \u2014 under the Cold Lake Settlement where a considerable area of land on the Reserve has been occupied by returned men and they are desirous that an effort should be made to provide for their religious needs. An additional teacher is needed for its Sunday day school. We would urge the full consideration of these matters by the missionary and stationing Committee of the Annual Conference and would urge the securing of whatever additional help is found to be needed and its placing of the whole work under the supervision of its present missionary.\nJuly 8th, 1920.\n\nMr. Duncan C.

In view of the very doubtful success of a day school on this reserve and the completion in due course of the large school at Edmonton, which will take care of all the Methodist children of Alberta, I regret that I cannot see my way clear to recommending the expenditure that would be entailed in establishing and maintaining a day school at this point.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

The Department has decided not to build for the present. There is a church there belonging to the Methodist body that can be used for that purpose. Would the Department sanction the paying of a teacher if we place one there?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. Steiner\n\nRF/3R.\nOttawa, October 20, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nRev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Day School, states that he has received a strong request from the Methodist Missionary at Hobbs, Alta., for the re-opening of a school on the Louis Bull Reserve. He states that there is a church belonging to the Methodists that could be used for class-room purposes and wishes to know whether the Department would sanction the paying of the salary of a teacher, if they send one there.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will furnish your views regarding this request and whether you consider that a school should be opened on this reserve. In this connection I may say that, when the new industrial school at Edmonton is completed, it is hoped that it will provide accommodation for all the Methodist children on this reserve. In the meantime, however, if you consider it advisable that a day school be provided at this point, the Department would give the request of the Rev. Mr. Ferrier favourable consideration.

I may add that, upon completion in due course of the large school at Edmonton, it is expected that all the Methodist Indian children of Alberta will be provided for in that institution.

There is a Bear Hills on the Ermineskin's Reserve. If you will state definitely where Bear's Hill is located, giving the name of the Reserve, the Department will be in a position to consider your request.

Bury, of the Church of the Nazarene, for the establishment of a mission and school on the Louis Bull Indian Reserve, to be conducted under the auspices of his church, I beg to say that this Reserve, as far as the spiritual needs of the Indians are concerned, has always been under the domination of the Methodist Church. The census return of 1916 (the last for which figures are available) shows that there were 84 Indians in the Band, 62 of whom were classed as Methodists and 22 as Roman Catholics.\n\nThe day school on this Reserve has been closed for several years, but requests have frequently been made by Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, to have it re-opened. In a recent letter to the Department he states that he has the offer of a teacher, and that the Methodist Church has a building in which it would be suitable to carry on school work, and he requested the sanction of the Department to appoint a teacher and re-open the school. He stated that the delay in building the proposed industrial school at Edmonton makes it imperative that some provision be made to retain the Methodist Indian children until such time as the proposed industrial school is ready for occupation. His request has been referred to Mr. Commissioner Graham.\n\nI might further point out that this Reserve has always been considered as under the auspices of the Methodist Church, and I am of the opinion that they would strongly object to having a school re-opened on the Reserve under the auspices of another religious body and authority granted for a missionary being appointed. This latter point is submitted for your consideration in dealing with the request of Rev. Mr. Bury.\n\nThe file containing the correspondence is submitted herewith.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSept. 23rd, 1921.\nOttawa, Sept 23, 1921\n\nMr.\n\nPlease report an attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\nMemorandum,\n\nHon. Sir James Lougheed.\n\nSeptember 30, 1921.\n\nWith reference to the attached letter, from Rev. James H. Bury, of the Church of the Nazarene, with regard to the establishment of a school on Louis Bull's reserve, Hobbema agency, I beg to say that the last census showed that there were 84 Indians in this band, 62 of whom were classed as Methodists, and 22 as Roman Catholics. The Ermineskin's boarding school is available for the Roman Catholic children. For some time the Methodists conducted a day school on the reserve, which, owing to lack of attendance, was closed some years ago. Just lately, considerable correspondence has passed between the Rev. T. Perrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, and the Department, in reference to the reopening of a day school which the Church wishes to conduct, pending the erection of the new industrial school at Edmonton. The question is at present before Commissioner Graham, and I think it is quite likely that we will agree to conduct a day school in a building which they will provide, for a time, at least. Under the circumstances, I do not see how we could consider the establishment of a school to be conducted under the auspices of the Church of the Nazarene.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd inst. No. 112-5-1 informing me that Reverend T. Ferrier, Superintendent of the Methodist Indian Schools, states that he has an offer of a teacher for the Louis Full Reserve, and requests that the school be re-opened.\n\nYou will recall that you wrote to me on the 20th October on the same subject, stating that Mr. Ferrier had received a similar request for the opening of the school. I wrote stating at the time that I thought it would be undesirable to open the school as we were shortly to open a new school at Edmonton. At that time I thought the school would be in operation before now, but it seems we are just as far away from opening now as we were when I wrote that letter a year ago. I would be in favor of opening a Day School to hold the children, but I am very much opposed to providing expensive desks. It is possible that we have desks at some of our other schools that are not in use, and could be sent there, but I do not know of any. To equip this school and close it in a year's time would not be good business.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, Oct. 3rd, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that, at the request of the Rev. T.

Mr. Ferrier has been requested to arrange to have it fitted up for school purposes, and the desks can be supplied from the stock which was taken over from the Red Deer Industrial School.\n\nMr. Ferrier has been requested to obtain the services of a suitable teacher and as soon as the Department receives notice as to the teacher engaged you will be further informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of September 22nd, No. 112-5-1, regarding Mr. W. E. Elliot, late Teacher at the Louis Bull Indian Day School. The action of the Department in this matter is quite satisfactory to the authorities of the Methodist Church.\n\nIn answer to his claim, concerning which I wrote him, I have instructed the Treasurer to send him $37.50, the amount he claims is due him for teaching. He also puts in a claim to me for $70 cash that he says he spent in fitting up the house that he lives in. I am making provision that this shall be refunded to him.\n\nMr. Elliot puts in a further claim for $50 for labour that he gave, personally, on the building. I may say that, in harmony with our policy, we would not be able to pay this amount, as we never duplicate a man's salary from the funds of the Missionary Society. Nearly all our teachers and missionaries among the Indian people are doing this class of work continually, and we never think of paying extra for such services. However, I shall bring the whole matter before our General Board of Missions and, if they see fit to consider this $50, I shall have no objection to his receiving it.\n\nI trust that this will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the LOUIS BULL School.

Fuller,\nInsp.\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask., June 14, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nLouis Bull's Day School.\n\nThis school is taught by Mr. T. E. Sinclair, and was opened in Jan. 1922. It had been closed for a number of years, so the children have had no previous training. At the present time there are twenty-one on the roll, all in grade one. At the time of my visit there were five boys and four girls present. I examined the children in their work and think they are getting along very well considering the fact that they have only been in school for a little over a year; and also when they entered they could not speak English.\n\nThe same thing applies here as at the Samson Day School in regard to attendance - it is very irregular; but I believe Mr. Sinclair is a very conscientious worker and considering the circumstances under which he is laboring, in my opinion, he is doing very well.\n\nM. Christiansen,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nApril 28, 1924.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nRev. T.

Agent and teacher should be so informed in due course.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, May 14, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to confirm your conversation with the Superintendent of Indian Education and to inform you that the Department agrees to the closing of the Louis Bull Indian Day School as at the 30th proximo. The children who have attended should be recruited for the Edmonton Indian Residential School. Please inform Mr. Sinclair, the teacher, and communicate with the Rev. Principal of the Edmonton institution, so that he can take concerted action with the Indian Agent with a view to having the children placed in the residential school. Mr. Commissioner Graham and Mr. Indian Agent Askey have been informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, May 14, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department has corresponded with the Methodist Church authorities and it has been decided to close the Louis Bull Indian Day School on the 30th proximo. The children who are attending this school should be recruited for the Edmonton Indian Residential School and I should be pleased if you would communicate with the Rev. Principal of that institution, with a view to taking concerted action in the matter of having the children admitted for the fall term.\n\nThe Methodist Church authorities will inform Mr. Sinclair, the teacher, of the closing of the day school, but it would be advisable for you to give him official notice from this Department as well. You will take measures to safeguard any government equipment in the school and, when action has been taken, please notify the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Mr. Taylor our missionary at Hobema. He is of the opinion that the attendance at Louis Bull warrants keeping it open for at least another year. At present he says the parents are not favorable to the children being recruited for Edmonton but believes that at the end of another year it might be possible to recruit the greater part of them. This phase was not discussed when I was in Ottawa. What is the opinion of the Department regarding continuing it for one more year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Carrier\nOttawa, May 27, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the closing of the Louis Bull Indian Day School. The Department has given this question careful consideration, and, in view of the reports that have been received from various sources and the advisability of filling the Edmonton Indian Residential School, it has been decided to make no change in our plans. The Indian Commissioner and the Indian Agent were advised on the 14th instant that the day school would be closed on the 30th proximo and the pupils recruited for the Edmonton Indian Residential School. I should be pleased if you would inform the teacher and the missionary that it is considered in the best interests of the work to close the school and that they should do their best to cooperate with the Rev. Mr. Woodsworth and the Indian Agent in the effort to place the children at Edmonton.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nRev. T. Ferrier\nSuperintendent of Methodist Indian Schools and Hospitals in Canada\n\nThe Secretary Dept.\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThere is a request from the Louis Bull Reserve to keep open the school for another year. There is also a suggestion that if one school is closed, let it be Samson for one year instead of Louis Bull.\n\nWould you kindly look into the reports of attendance and advise on this latter suggestion.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nT. Ferrier\nOttawa, June 25, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, in further reference to the closing of the Louis Bull Indian Day School at the end of the present school year. In reply I beg to say that the attendance at this school during the past year has been very irregular. The highest enrolment during any quarter was 15 pupils. The average attendance for the year was 7.\n\nAt Samson's Day School the highest enrolment, which was for the December quarter, last, was 36 pupils. The attendance at this school was also irregular, the average attendance for the year being 11.\n\nIt was understood that when the Edmonton Residential School was open and in active operation, both the above named schools were to be closed and the children recruited to Edmonton. As you were informed in our letter of May 27th, last, the Department has given the matter careful consideration and has decided that of the two schools it is advisable to close Louis Bull's. Instructions have been issued to the Indian Commissioner and the local Indian Agent, as well as yourself, to that effect. The Department is not disposed to change the plans that have been made for the closing of the Louis Bull School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your communication No. II2-5-I, dated May 14th last, and to the closing of Louis Bull's Day School, I beg to state that upon the receipt of your latter I notified the Teacher Mr. T.E. Sinclair.\n\nSchool was closed on June 27th and I am taking charge of the school material and government equipment.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

The general impression is that if the school is not kept open for another year, it will react against securing pupils for the Edmonton school. Would it taking too much to have the Department request a report from Mr. Askey on this situation?\n\nI am making this request on Mr. Woodsworth's recommendation as he believes it would greatly help the cause at Edmonton if the Louis Bull School were continued for one more year.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT.

They estimated that between 25 and 30 children would attend if a Day School were opened up there. Agent promised to take this matter up with Inspector Gooderham.\n\nHarold Moore,\nClerk in charge.\n\nCopied:\nCS\nB. F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Day School Program - Hobbema Indian Agency\n\nOn a recent visit to this Agency, the Superintendent, Mr. Woodsworth, suggested it would be better to start a consolidated unit, centrally situated, than to erect small units at scattered points on the various reserves of this Agency. I believe this is well taken.\n\nThe program for 48/49 includes one day school for this Agency, I believe, and it was recommended that this be placed on the Louis Bull's Reserve. If Mr. Woodsworth's suggestion is to be carried out, this unit should not be on the Louis Bull's Reserve, but should more likely be near the Indian Agency.\n\nThis letter is written to get your reaction to such a suggestion, also to ascertain if the plans of the small schools, which you propose to erect, are such that they can be enlarged or increased into a multiple unit.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nMarch 3, 1946.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nDay School Program - Hobbsen Indian Agency.\n\nReference your 112-6-3 of February 25 -\n\nThe Departmental policy with regard to consolidation is that where possible we do not erect one-room schools, but rather, larger schools where a more efficient educational program can be covered.\n\nHowever, we have experienced considerable difficulty in putting this policy into effect, due to the poor road facilities which exist on most Indian reserves. The main factor in consolidation is that bus transportation can be provided for children from scattered homes, in order that they may be carried to a larger day school.\n\nThe one-room day school, of which we have now prepared a standard plan, is such that it can be easily expanded into a two-room school by having an extra class conducted in the basement. This basement has been designed in such a way as to provide ample light. In fact, there is as much light in the basement as there is in the main classroom.\n\nFor extra teacher's quarters, the store room and boiler room (for hot water heating) can be easily converted for extra accommodation.\n\nHowever, it would seem that a thorough educational survey of the Hobbsen Agency should be carried out before any definite decision is reached. If you so wish, we can arrange to have our Educational Survey Officer visit your Inspectorate in May or June and carry out such a survey. I will expect to hear further from you in this regard.\n\nBernard V. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Woodsworth\nHobbema Superintendency:\nProposed Day School for Louis Bull Band:\n\nOn May 18 I went to the Louis Bull area with Mr. Superintendent Woodsworth and the Assistant for the area, Mr. T.G. McLeod. It was necessary to drive thirty miles in order to get to a point only six miles from agency headquarters. The visit had been scheduled for an earlier date but all roads were then impassable.\n\nThe upper photo shows the general area near the old school where the Indians want the new installation. In the lower photo a man is shown standing behind a stake that marks where the northwest corner of the school should rest. The old school appears in the left rear. The point marked is approximately at \"X\" in the upper picture. The bottom photo shows the view south to Hobbema, with the band's Catholic mission on the skyline.\n\nThe ground shown is high enough to prevent the basement from flooding. Water should not be a problem. A 400 ft well (drilled) is suggested. This work must, I am told, await the completion of hospital well (August 1st).\n\nIt appears possible to obtain Indian carpenters, labourers, and a cement worker. Local department officials are already considering possible contractors and sources of materials.\n\nThe Indians brought up the matter of religion in the school. With the approval of his fellow-tribesmen one man said: \"We want to continue to be Catholics in the morning, Baptists in the afternoon, United Church in the evening, and Sun Dancers when we feel like it.\" More reasonably, they insisted that they want to model procedures on the pattern of the Alberta public schools. They look for a community-centered school offering some adult education.\n\nThe band claims 76 children under 16. They want the 15 who attend Erminekin to attend the day school. I told them that academic progress in a one-room school would probably be slower than in a well-graded school, but they insisted that the day school would have compensating factors. They promised to enforce attendance.\n\nThe family farthest away lives 2\u00bd miles from the site. Many parents would like to have their children start school at six, but there will be enough for one teacher to handle with the present age limits. We might look forward to a consolidated school for the upper grades later on in the pattern of the Muncey reserve.\n\nThe question of ownership of the site was raised. Rev. A.J. Law, United Church missionary, disclaims any title.\n\nC.A.F.

Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nLouis Bull Reserve\n\nWe have now received Major Clark's report upon his visit and inspection at the Louis Bull Reserve. I understand that a site has been selected which satisfies practically all requirements. It is understood that a delay can be anticipated until a well has been drilled. Major Clark advises that a 400 ft. drilled well will probably be required and that this work will have to wait until the completion of a hospital well (August first).\n\nAs you know, we have a standard bill of materials now for this one-room school, listing all requirements for its construction. We have found elsewhere that the employment of a good foreman carpenter at an hourly rate (usually $1.50 per hour) is the best solution for the erection of the school. The Department can buy all the materials and arrange to have them shipped to the nearest station. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Indian Superintendent Woodsworth, in the hope that he will know of such a carpenter who can supervise the work of Indian carpenters, labourers, etc. I understand that you already have on hand a number of copies of the bills of materials referred to above. In submitting a requisition for the materials it is only necessary to state on a requisition form \"Materials as listed on the attached bill for standard one-room Indian day school and attached teacher's residence\". You can then list local suggested sources for the following\nmajor items:\n\n(1) Gravel, stone, tile, etc.\n(2) Lumber and millwork,\n(3) Hardware,\n(4) Paint,\n(5) Plumbing supplies.\n\nThe cement is usually ordered direct from the factory.\n\nBernard F.

Gooderham's Report on the Louis Bull Day School. Original on file #754-1.\n\nI visited the site on the Bull Reserve picked for the new Day School and I also surveyed the general situation on the Samson and Ermineskin Reserves. On these two reserves there are a number of children not receiving any education and I believe that these children with other pupils, who are now attending residential schools, could be put into a two-roomed school located near the village of Hobbema, provided transportation was available. The province have lately completed some highways through these Reserves, on which vans could operate the year round and to which most of the pupils would have very short distances to walk. There will be more information about this at a later date. If such a program could be carried out, practically all the children of school age on the Reserves at Hobbema can be cared for in residential and day schools.\nEXTRACT FROM THE\nMINUTES OF THE LOUIS BULL COUNCIL MEETING HELD ON MONDAY, JUNE 20TH, 1949.\n\nChildren:\n\nChildren for the Day School must be examined for application for the school.\n\nLaw:\n\nUnder Section 185 of the Indian Act, Council passed the following law: \"Children attending the Louis Bull Day School are to start school at the age of six.\"\n\n(Sgd.)

Mr. Rapske is apparently a member of the same church operating the day school on the Montana Reserve. It is known that the North American Baptist Church is doing considerable proselytizing on the Louis Bull Reserve and I am informed by Mr. Woodsworth that they appear to be making some progress.\n\nI have acknowledged Mr. Rapske's application, advising him that I have sent a copy to you. I do not know how many college credits are required for a degree in the United States, but I am advising Mr. Rapske that we would prefer to employ a teacher with a first-class Alberta certificate, if one can be found.\n\nFor your information, I visited the site of the Louis Bull School last week. The foundation was completed and the frame work up. The carpenters were beginning to sheath the walls.\n\nG. H.

Gooderham\n\nDear Mr. Gooderham:\n\nI understand you are at present looking for a school teacher to take the position in the day school to be built on Bull's Reserve, Hobbema. I have had a special interest in the welfare of the Indian people for some time now. If the opportunity for this teaching position is still open, I would appreciate having you consider my qualifications and application for it.\n\nI am a Baptist, member of the Emmanuel Baptist Church, and the pastor of this church is Rev. W. Sturhalen for further reference refer to him at Morris, Manitoba. Now you no doubt also require to know what education I have had. In 1946 I completed my High School, then for two winters following I attended the Christian Training Institute at Edmonton. It was while in Edmonton that I became interested in Indian work. Then this last spring of 1949, I completed one year of college work at the North American Baptist Seminary, Rochester 7, New York. Added to this I took one course, Geology at the University of Rochester. This gave me a total of 37 college credits.\n\nAt the present time I am enrolled in the College at Sioux Falls, South Dakota. If the school at Bull's reserve should not be ready for opening by the middle of February, I would be able to finish another 17 to 19 credits. This would give me a total of 54 to 56 college credits, provided of course that you consider accepting me.\n\nI am 21 years old and my birthday is January 17, 1928. I am 5' 9\u00bd\" tall and am of German descent.\n\nFor references apply to Rev. E. P. Wahl, 10810-78th Ave. Edmonton, Alberta (President of the Christian Training Institute) Dr. G. A. Lang, President of the North American Baptist Seminary, Rochester 7, New York. Dr. T. W. Bender, former professor of the North American Baptist Seminary, 246 Alexander St., Rochester 7, New York.

Also, I have heard of the desire to have a Baptist school-teacher.\n\nI have a very special interest in the Indian work at Bull's Reserve. While at the Christian Training Institute at Edmonton, I was able to visit the reserve with Rev. Benke several times. I was struck by the widespread ignorance prevalent among the Indians in our modern times, and the needs of this people has become of very special interest to me.\n\nI am at the present time attending the Sioux Falls College in South Dakota. I have entered this study year with the purpose of better equipping myself for the very work you would require.\n\nLast year, I attended the North American Baptist Seminary at Rochester, New York, where my total college credits amounted to 33 and 4 credits in a Theological course. 6 of these credits were taken at the University of Rochester in the course of Geology. I have completed high school. I understand that you would like to have a high school graduate with one year university.\n\nI would like to apply for the position of teacher of the new school being built and I would very much appreciate having you consider my application.\n\nIf the school should not be ready to open before the beginning of February, 1950, I would be able to finish another 16 college credits, making a total of 49.\n\nMy age is 21, and date of birth Jan. 17, 1928. My height is 5 ft. 9 in. and I am of German descent.\nIf there is additional information you would like to have in considering my application, I will be glad to furnish such, if possible.\n\nFor recommendation, please apply to my pastor, Rev. W. Sturholm, Morris Manitoba; Rev. E. P. Wahl, President of Christian Training Institute, 10810 - 78 Ave., Edmonton, Alberta; Prof. R. Jeschke, registrar of the North American Baptist Seminary, 246 Alexander St., Rochester 7, New York.\n\nI am a member of the Emmanuel Baptist Church, Morris, Manitoba.

If the officials of the Indian Affairs Branch at Ottawa appoint him I would endorse such an appointment.\n\nWould you please let me know as soon as you receive word from Ottawa about Arnold Rapske's application as the teacher of Bull Reserve School. Thank you ever so much.\n\nThe people on the Bull Reserve have placed confidence in us in that they asked us to supply them with a teacher. And we surely want to try and place a good teacher there who will do justice to the calling of a teacher. We may humbly say: if we are only given the opportunity by the Grace of God we will satisfy as much as lies within us.\n\nVisiting the Camsell Hospital recently, I also spoke with Narcius Brown. And of his own accord he said that he wants our church to supply the teacher for the Day School on Bull Reserve.\n\nThanking you for your courtesy and trusting to have a reply soon.\n\nYours for the betterment of our Indian friends,\n\nBible Teacher and Missionary\n\n\"Fred W. Benke\"\n\nAddress: Rev. Fred W. Benke  \n10831 98 Street  \nEdmonton, Alberta\nOctober 17, 1949.\n\nMr. H.N. Woodsworth,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nHobbema, Alta.,\n\nLouis Bull Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 112-6-10\n\nYou can show Major Clark a copy of the Reverend Mr. Benke's letter when the Inspector visits the school.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/HM\nSuperintendent of Education:\n\nLouis Bull Indian Day School\n\nReligious denomination of teacher:\n\nThis question has been discussed with Rev. Fr. Schmidt and the Rev. F.W. Benke. Each wishes his denomination to dominate the operation of this school, and each has the support of some heads of families. If the Baptists turn out to be in the majority, heads of Roman Catholic families who insist on their children attending a school under non-Catholic auspices (as the Baptist majority will certainly require) are inviting sanctions.\n\nI have suggested to the missionaries and to Mr. Supt. Woodsworth that in a few weeks' time each family head living within the school radius be required to make a statutory declaration of his present faith, as oral statements at census-time and petitions with signatures and votes at meetings have proved to be very confusing.\n\nThe family head is to be instructed fully that this statement will be used by the Department to determine the type of school to which the Department may send the child. Parents may, of course, on their own responsibility send their children to schools under denominational auspices other than their own. There are Anglican children attending Presbyterian and United Church schools.\n\nThe missionaries meanwhile will have a chance to explain to their denominations' adherents the significance of such statutory declarations, and to consider further whether the Louis Bull land will benefit by the application of s. 100 (2). The Baptists are unlikely to be able to nominate a certificate teacher. The Roman Catholics may not be in the majority.\nAs the band's members were formerly Methodists for the most part, and subsequently United Church; and as they formerly expressed to me a wish to have their day school conducted in the manner of an Alberta public school, if the Baptists prove to be in the majority, and if their denomination cannot supply a certificated teacher, they and their missionary should be requested to accept a certificated teacher of a denomination which is not trying to gain converts on this reserve. Such teacher should be required to restrict religious observances during school-hours, at all times, indeed, while he has charge of the pupils, to such observances as are acceptable to all whose attendance at the school is ordered or agreed upon.\n\nC.A.T.

You will note hereunder Major Clark's report of October 16th indicating that there is a distinct difference of opinion with regard to which denomination is in the majority.\n\nI would like to discuss with you the proposals made by Major Clark with regard to the settling of this controversy.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

The Reverend Fred Benke approached the council regarding supplying a teacher. The Indians expressed themselves in favor of a teacher of the Baptist denomination as they have in previous meetings. The council asked Mr. Benke if his church could supply a qualified teacher. All present at the meeting were in favor of a Baptist teacher. There was no one against it.\n\n(Signed) H.N.Woodsworth,\nSupt. Hobbeema Indian Agency.\nEdmonton, Alberta  \nSeptember 24th, 1949\n\nMr. H. N. Woodsworth  \nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs  \nHobbema, Alberta\n\nDear Mr. Woodsworth:\n\nHerewith I am enclosing the letter from Miss Felicite Strohschein of Wetaskiwin, Alberta expressing her wish to become the teacher in the Montana Reserve Day School. Would you kindly forward this request to the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa. Thank you. Mr. and Mrs. R. Neuman and myself are well satisfied with the ability of Miss Strohschein. She has been along quite frequently in the different types of mission work among the Indians. And has a special fondness to teach Indian children. The Neuman's will arrange with her about board and room.\n\nMay I kindly ask the following about this school on the Montana Reserve: Is this school now fully recognized by the Department of Indian Affairs as a Government Day School?\n\nWill the teacher receive full Government pay when she takes up her duties by the beginning of May, 1950 at the completion of her studies at the University?\n\nIn one of our former conversations you mentioned that having the school in our church we would therefore be entitled to receive rent. Would you kindly take this up with the proper officials and let me know their re-action. We are pleased to have your frequent visits to our school and the interest that you show. You have no doubt noticed that church and school in the one building is rather crowded. But we are willing to carry on for a while in such cramped conditions so that our dear Indian friends may receive a better education. But we hope that the time will soon come when the Government will erect a school and rooms for the teacher on the Montana Reserve. I am sure that you are giving these vital matters your thoughtful concern and are urging the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa to take action in the not too distant future. It would be good. Would you kindly give me the information about the Montana Day school as above stated as soon as you find it convenient. Much obliged.\n\nReceived with many thanks the permit from the Department of Indian Affairs to erect a Baptist Church on the Bull Reserve. I have forwarded this valuable document to our Mission Headquarters for their further thoughtful and prayerful consideration. And they will take action as soon as feasible. We want to do our best for these people both old and young.\n\nWe have also good prospect for a Normal School teacher to take over the new school on the Bull Reserve as soon as it is finished and open for class instruction. Would you please keep me informed as to the developments of the school.\n\nThanking you for your kind consideration and helpful suggestions.\n\nYours for the Welfare of the Indians.\n\n\"Fred W.

At one time, the majority of these Indians were Methodists but seem to have changed their faith.\n\nOn September 19th, 1949, at the request of the Chief and Council, a meeting of the Band was held on the Louis Bull Reserve, and a vote was taken to try to get an indication of the type of teacher wanted. The Indians by vote favored a teacher of the Baptist faith and the Chief and Council signed a resolution to this effect. Narcisse Brown, councillor, was absent being hospitalized at the Charles Camsell Indian Hospital in Edmonton and was unable to sign. Previously he has indicated his agreement in the matter.\n\nDue to the effort of the Indian Association of Alberta, the Indians have been led to believe that what shall be an undenominational day school will be established, in which all faiths attend and the various missionaries are allotted time for religious instruction. Regarding the matter of a sworn statement as to religious affiliation indicated by Major C.A.F. Clark in his letter of October 16th to you, could we be advised further about this?\n\nAttached, find vote taken and resolution signed by the Chief and Council of the Louis Bull Band.\n\nH. N.

We are completing plans for a building project erection in the summer of 1950.\n\n(b) The teacher will be classified according to our salary schedule when the Department school opens in either September or October depending upon when it is completed.\n\nIt is normally our practice to advertise for teachers for the new schools which we are erecting. You might discuss this matter with Mr. Gooderham and find out whether he considers it worthwhile to advertise for teachers for both the Louis Bull and Montana (when the new schools are completed).\n\nBernard F.

N. Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\n\nEncl.\nHNW/ehg\nEdmonton, Alberta  \nNovember 2nd, 1949\n\nMr. H. Woodsworth  \nHobbema, Alberta  \nDear Mr. Woodsworth:\n\nOn my recent visit to the Bull Reserve I noticed that the school building is making good progress. You will of course better know about the actual procedure. But from what I note, it seems that the building should be finished this year.\n\nYou will recall that at the Band Meeting on the Bull Reserve the Indians asked for a Baptist School teacher and you asked me whether we could supply one by January since then the Indians have repeatedly asked whether we can have a teacher for them. Now we can state that we have a fine Christian girl, who has a love for the Indian children and is willing to take over as a teacher by January, if she has definite word about her acceptance in good time before. She has teacher's certificate and has teaching experience. Her name is Miss Bernice Stober.\n\nWould you kindly inform Mr. Gooderham about this well qualified school teacher. And that he can notify the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa. We will be willing to send in any further information about this teacher when ever requested. Please let me know!\n\nThanking you for your courtesy,\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Fred W. Benke\"\n\nAddress: Rev. Fred. W. Benke  \n10831 98th Street  \nEdmonton, Alberta\nEdmonton, Alberta,\nSeptember 24th, 1949.\n\nMr. H.N. Woodsworth,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nHobbema, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Woodsworth:\n\nHerewith I am enclosing the letter from Miss Felicite Strohschien of Wetaskiwin, Alberta, expressing her wish to become the teacher in the Montana Reserve Day School. Would you kindly forward this request to the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa. Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Neuman and myself are well satisfied with the ability of Miss Strohschien. She has been along quite frequently in the different types of mission work among the Indians. And has a special fondness to teach Indian children. The Neuman's will arrange with her about board and room.\n\nMay I kindly ask the following about this school on the Montana Reserve: Is this school now fully recognized by the Department of Indian Affairs as a Government Day School?\n\nWill the teacher receive full Government pay when she takes up her duties by the beginning of May, 1950 at the completion of her studies at the University?\n\nIn one of our former conversations you mentioned that having the school in our church we would therefore be entitled to receive rent. Would you kindly take this up with the proper officials and let me know their reaction. We are pleased to have your frequent visits to our school and the interest that you show. You have no doubt noticed that church and school in the one building is rather crowded. But we are willing to carry on for a while in such crowded conditions so that our dear Indian friends may receive a better education. But we hope that the time will soon come when the Government will erect a school and rooms for the teacher on the Montana Reserve. I am sure that you are giving these vital matters your thoughtful concern and are urging the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa to take action in the not too distant future. It would be good. Would you kindly give me the information about the Montana Day School as above stated as soon as you find it convenient. Much obliged.\n\nReceived with many thanks the permit from the Department of Indians Affairs to erect a Baptist Church on the Bull Reserve. I have forwarded this valuable document to our Mission Headquarters for their further thoughtful and prayerful consideration. And they will take action as soon as feasible. We want to do our best for these people both old and young.\n\nWe have also good prospect for a Normal School teacher to take over the new school on the Bull Reserve as soon as it is finished and open for class instruction. Would you please keep me informed as to the developments of the school.\n\nThanking you for your kind consideration and helpful suggestions.\n\nYours for the Welfare of the Indians.\n\n\"Fred W.

Reserves in this province.\n\nHobbema Agency\n\nThere is a demand for a day school on the Louis Bull Reserve. A building which was used as a day school many years ago still stands at a point where there should be between fifteen to twenty pupils. We are informed that it could be made usable for less than $500.00 in repairs, and that a teacherage could be built at a point where there is good water, and not over one-half mile from the school.\n\nThe foregoing is brought to your attention in order to ascertain what is the policy with regard to day schools in this province. Is the Branch prepared to start day schools this year if suitable accommodation can be found and teachers located to man the schools.

I understand that a site has been selected which satisfies practically all requirements. It is understood that a delay can be anticipated until a well has been drilled. Major Clark advises that a 400 ft. drilled well will probably be required and that this work will have to wait until the completion of a hospital well (August first).\n\nAs you know, we have a standard bill of materials now for this one-room school, listing all requirements for its construction. We have found elsewhere that the employment of a good foreman carpenter at an hourly rate (usually $1.50 per hour) is the best solution for the erection of the school. The Department can buy all the materials and arrange to have them shipped to the nearest station. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Indian Superintendent Woodsworth, in the hope that he will know of such a carpenter who can supervise the work of Indian carpenters, labourers, etc. I understand that you already have on hand a number of copies of the bills of materials referred to above. In submitting a requisition for the materials it is only necessary to state on a requisition form \"Materials as listed on the attached bill for standard one-room Indian day school and attached teacher's residence\". You can then list local suggested sources for the following\nmajor items:\n\n(1) Gravel, stone, tile, etc.\n(2) Lumber and millwork,\n(3) Hardware,\n(4) Paint,\n(5) Plumbing supplies.\n\nThe cement is usually ordered direct from the factory.\n\nBernard E.

It is expected that the well must be drilled to a depth of at least 300 ft., and therefore the estimated cost will be in the neighborhood of $600.00.\n\nThe driller had just completed a well in the vicinity of the school site and unless given this work would have moved away. I, therefore, authorized Mr. Woodsworth to employ him to commence immediately.

Gooderham Regional Supervisor Indian Agencies in which he quotes a telegram sent by Mr. Neary regarding the well on the Louis Bull Reserve Day School site. I beg to inform you that the services of well drillers are very hard to procure.\n\nMr. A.Knie and Son well drillers who are to commence within the next week or two on a well for the Hobbema hospital have had great success in getting water on the reserve. They have drilled a great number of wells for us and have found satisfactory water supplies. No one can ever be certain that a well may be a failure or not.\n\nIn order that a well be drilled at the Day school site before freeze-up it is imperative that Mr. A.Knie proceed with the well which is now underway.\n\nThis matter was discussed with Mr. G.H. Gooderham on June 19, 1948 when he visited this Agency.\n\nAttached find an agreement signed by Mr. Knie. Casing will be borrowed from casing on hand at this Agency which is used for drilling wells on the various reserves.\n\nYour understanding of the necessity of proceeding with drilling will be appreciated.\n\nH.N.

In this area water is at a depth over 400 ft. This was known by previous drillings in this area. We were very lucky to secure water as some drillings to the north west have been unsuccessful.\n\nMr. McLeod Assistant and myself inspected the flow of water at this well. After testing over an hour we found an undiminished flow with slow pumping of over 2\u00bd gal. per minute. This supply will be adequate for any demands.\n\nFor your information the following data was secured.\n\n1. Water flow at 2\u00bd gal. per minute or 150 gal. per hour.\n2. 3\" casing used supplied by agency from Ermineskin stock pile 224 ft. from top.\n3. Well drilled to depth of 405 ft. Water rises in well to 120 ft. from top.\n4. Impossible to pump by hand small 1\u00bd H.P. motor at least required. Well drillers advise slow pumping. If power installed pressure tank should be put in.\n5. 1 5/8 x 16 cylinder needed.\n6. 180 ft. of 1\" pipe.\n\nThe well has been capped pending decision of Department in purchasing pipe and pump and pump engine. The well drillers are available to supply or install this equipment.\n\n(sgd.) H. N.

Please note what data and information he has given and what is required to complete the well.\n\nIt is also to be reported that Mr. Woodsworth got an estimate on the cost of running power over to this site from the Calgary Power Company. There is a little over two miles of line and the company stated that the costs would be in the neighborhood of $3,000.00, which figure no doubt is too high to be considered.\n\nThe Alberta Construction Company of Edmonton has already made a bid on other buildings on this reserve and may be the successful bidders for this work. It is noted that this company has also quoted $7,955.00 for construction of the Alexander's Day School, which is a similar school, and I doubt, they would be prepared to do this one. I would like very much to know if this price would be considered if it were the lowest received. As you know, we are very anxious to get some of this construction started, and a company is more interested when there are three or four buildings to erect. For your information, the other buildings in question on this reserve are a hospital and Clerk's house.\n\nYour reply would be appreciated.\n\nG. H.

Original on file # 754-1.\n\nI visited the site on the Bull Reserve picked for the new Day School and I also surveyed the general situation on the Samson and Ermineskin Reserves. On these two reserves there are a number of children not receiving any education and I believe that these children with other pupils, who are now attending residential schools, could be put into a two-roomed school located near the village of Hobbema, provided transportation was available. The province have lately completed some highways through these Reserves, on which vans could operate the year round and to which most of the pupils would have very short distances to walk. There will be more information about this at a later date. If such a program could be carried out, practically all the children of school age on the Reserves at Hobbema can be cared for in residential and day schools.\nDecember 14, 1943.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nLouis Bull Indian Day School\n\nI note your recommendation that instead of providing a one room school, we provide a two room school and arrange for bus transportation.\n\nIf this school were located near Hobemma village, would it be possible to arrange for a bus contractor who would carry these children daily? It does not pay the Department to establish its own buses unless there are a large number of children involved. Elsewhere we have been able to arrange for school buses under contract.\n\nI would like to discuss this situation with you when you visit Ottawa.\n\nBernard F.

It is noted that you are decided on a one-room school and that you recommend construction by day labour. It is noted that there are three men, namely, Jim Potts, Alex Wilson and Olle Hagen, who might be suitable for the job of foreman carpenter. Under separate cover, I am sending you two copies of Plan 888 and would appreciate a recommendation from you as to which of these three men you would feel to be the most satisfactory for the job. As soon as this matter has been settled, we will immediately arrange to purchase the bill of materials through the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nThis will leave only two matters to be settled, and these are the ownership of the land and the provision of Hydro. Is there any obstacle in the way of securing title to the land, or has this matter already been settled? Is there any possibility of having Hydro brought to the school, or would you recommend that the school only be wired at the present time and that steps be taken to have it connected at a later date.\n\nBernard F.

Woodsworth,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nHobbema, Alberta.\n\nLouis Bull Indian Day School.\n\nBy now you will have received copies of plan 888, the proposed school for this Reserve.\n\nIt is hoped that you are completing arrangements for a foreman carpenter to supervise the erection of this school.\n\nWe are prepared to order the materials as soon as we hear further from you.\n\nAs it takes two or three weeks to get the cement, I would suggest that you advise as soon as possible concerning the erection of this school.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nExtract from the Minutes of a Meeting of the Louis Bull Band Council, held April 19th, 1949.\n\nSchool: Superintendent Woodsworth informed the Council that it was the intention of the Department to build a school on the Louis Bull Reserve this year.\n\n(Sgd) H.

Both men are unavailable.\n\nJim Potts, Treaty Indian of the Samson Reserve, living at Pigeon Lake has been approached, and after careful consideration of the fact that he is an Indian and that there is a general prejudice against employing Indians in responsible positions, I find myself willing to recommend his services. This man is continually employed by whites as a carpenter and paid at highest rates. He has taken on the job many times of building houses, being solely in charge of construction. He is able to read blue prints. According to Mr. T. G. McLeod, Assistant, his workmanship is of a standard, if not above that of most white carpenters.\n\nI suggest that you proceed with ordering the required materials and we should receive an accountable cheque for two thousand dollars to pay labor immediately.\n\nIn view of your stated delay in securing cement, I suggest that we use cement belonging to the Department of National Health and Welfare, at present stored in our garage. Due to moisture conditions, the cement seems to be deteriorating. There are approximately 100 or more bags on hand. The Department of National Health and Welfare also have some form shipload on hand here that though used, would be satisfactory. If you could get the Director of that Department to authorize this arrangement, we would account for the material used of which they have an inventory and proceed at once with the foundation of the school. Gravel would have to be purchased locally from Gee or Ponoka, who has a gravel pit. Other material needed would have to be purchased by the Department.\n\nIf you think this arrangement satisfactory, especially in the case of the cement, we will make every effort to facilitate and build this school with a minimum of expense.\n\nH.

Potts as foreman-carpenter at the rate of $1.25 per hour. I enclose Contract Agreement in triplicate which he should sign and return to this office. We will then have it signed by the Deputy Minister, and two copies will be returned to you, one for your own office and one for Mr. Potts.\n\nWith regard to your suggestion about the cement, we have the following memorandum from the Assistant Director of Indian Health Services:\n\n\"Memorandum: Mr. B.F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nLoan of Cement to Indian Affairs Branch\n\nThe cement in storage at Hobbema will be used for the reconstruction of the hospital in the near future.\n\nIf this material will expedite the construction of your school, it could be loaned to you and replace If you expect delivery of cement within the next month, you may take the cement now in storage and return same as quickly as possible or within one month.\"\n\n.....\nAn accountable advance of $2,000.00 for payment of labour has been forwarded to you. It is understood that the accountable advance is only to be used in the payment of labour. You should forward accounts direct to the Department for payment of any material that you are authorized to purchase.\n\nThe gravel and sand may be purchased locally and the Department Purchasing Agent has been requested to purchase the materials.

As you are aware, the use of cans in this climate would be totally unsatisfactory as they would freeze. I suggest the only sanitary toilets are those containing a pit, individually located.\n\nH. N.

To date we have not been able to secure other than an approximate estimate of the cost of putting in hydro to this school from the Calgary Power Ltd. Their line crosses the reserve a little over a mile from the site of the school. There are two advantages in having electricity run into this school:\n\n(1) Most classrooms operate during the short daylight periods and I have found the usual country school without light to be a pretty dark place, especially around four o'clock in the winter months.\n\n(2) A good teacher will be easier to entice to the position if we have power.\n\n(3) Elimination of fire hazard using lamps.\n\nIf you consider it in order I will secure tenders for wiring and this could be done shortly as the construction of the school is now going ahead rapidly. Material seems to be arriving slowly though we are arranging for shortages as they become evident so not to hold up the workmen.\n\nH.N.Woodsworth,\nSuperintendent.\nSeptember 26th, 1949.\n\nMr. H.N.

It is not my desire to bring up any East-West controversy, but I would, nevertheless, like to point out that all buildings in Alberta are so equipped. In the coastal regions and the East, although rainfall is heavier during the season, it does not fall in such a short time as on the prairies. It has been found in this area that eavestroughing is necessary to remove the water from the immediate vicinity of the building and to direct it so as to avoid damage to the building and prevent ponds being formed around the structures.\n\nIt would be appreciated if eavestroughing was approved for the Louis Bull Day School.\n\nH.

These mats will be used in the Louis Bull Day School as when originally ordered from J.H. Ashdown; they informed us that they could not supply them and had cancelled our order. As a result, two cocoa mats were purchased locally for the Hobbema Day School.\n\nIt is felt that since these mats appear to be difficult to obtain at times, that rather than return them, it would be better to turn them over to the Louis Bull Day School.\n\nIt is hoped that you will concur in this arrangement.\n\nH.

Wiring: This work has been done, by authority of the Dept., that is just the rough wiring, the rest being left for further instructions. In this connection I might state that I have seen the local authorities of the Calgary Power Co. and they intend to extend the line to the Day School.\n\n2. Plumbing: I agree with you that the possibility of getting a bathroom into the present building is practically impossible unless a bulge was made into the Class Room, and when discussed was considered unsuitable.\n\nA. I have seen Mr. Pearson and received a quotation of the Pipe Valves and fittings, labor, etc., which is $1.70 per foot, the approximate distance would be 325 feet.\n\nB. I have seen Mr. Osterberg re the placing of a bathroom for the teacherage, and the only prospective point to be considered is on the S.W. corner of the School where one of the windows of the Teacherage would have to be cancelled and used as door into the bathroom, the question of heating the bathroom would then come up, as it is doubtful if the heat from the house would be strong enough to keep the pipes from freezing in severe weather.\n\nI am sorry to state that Mr. Osterberg called in yesterday, and advised me that the work was going along very satisfactory but that he was afraid that he would be held up for the windows, which he finds very difficult to get.\n\n(sgd) Anthony McMillan\nSuperintendent.\nS.

McMillan, Esq.,\nSuperintendent,\nPeigan Indian Agency,\nBROCKET, Alberta.\n\nRe: Peigan Indian Day School\n\n(1) Wiring.\n\nAs discussed over the telephone today, you should send a wire to Col. Neary stating that you have a tender of $220.00 to do the wiring only in the new day school and teacherage. For the time being you should not consider extending the wiring to any other buildings, just the school room and the teacher's quarters need be completed. As soon as Col. Neary sends his approval you can ask the electrician to commence. I did not ask you to get a price on fixtures because I think the Department should state the type of fixtures that should be installed.\n\n(2) Plumbing.\n\nMajor Clark suggested that a bathroom might be considered, and Col. Neary in his letter of November 16th, file 751-1 (E) stated that he would appreciate any recommendations which might be made to provide such facilities. The teacher being considered for this school is a married man with two small children. I definitely agree that at least a water supply and preferably a bath and toilet should be provided in this school. We have no authority to do so but I cannot see where it would be possible to provide a bathroom in Plan 888. The rooms are too small now to accommodate the teacher and his family. If a bathroom is installed there will have to be an extension to the building.\n\nI suggest you proceed as follows:\n\n(a) Obtain a price on the cost of extending the present Agency-Hospital water supply to the school. This will at least provide a supply of water in the kitchen and obviate the necessity of carrying water all the way from the hospital by pail.\n\n(b) Discuss with the contractor the possibility of erecting an extension to the building to provide a bathroom if such an extension is possible without spoiling the appearance of the building.\n\nThe main consideration now is the price on getting the water supply to the teacherage.\n\nIf Mr. Osterberg thinks that a bathroom extension is possible, he might be able to give you some rough idea as to what this would cost, including the fixtures, installation and septic tank.\n\nI repeat, we have no authority to do any of this extra work and it must not be undertaken until the Department has indicated approval.\n\nG.

The day school is under construction and Mr. Osterberg, the contractor, informs me that with reasonably good climatic conditions it can be completed by Christmas.\n\nThe contractor and Mr. McMillan brought up two matters:\n\n(1) Wire for electricity. Unfortunately we should have used the plan adapted for locations near hydro-power. The agency is served by hydro-power (Calgary Power Company) and Mr. McMillan is endeavouring to have the line extended from the hospital over a distance of about 175 Ft. without cost to us. The school should therefore definitely be wired and I have asked Mr. McMillan to obtain a bid from a Pincher Creek firm covering only the rough installation of outlets, etc. and avoiding installation of fixtures for the time being as you may have some instructions with regard to the type of fixtures used in our schools.\n\n(2) Mr. Osterberg mentioned the fact that some of the moldings and casings provided in the bill of materials are no longer stocked in Alberta lumber yards. We have experienced this before in the construction of staff residences. He is mainly concerned with the casing. The type mentioned in the bill of materials must be milled and the mills are so busy that he cannot expect delivery for some time. However, the yard stock both Victory and Miracle casing. I recommend that he be authorized to use Miracle casing as this is every bit as good as the casing provided in the bill of materials. Please advise.\n\nG. H.

This was from Bennett & White Calgary, Limited, and was in the amount of $22,391.00.\n\nAs we have had this particular school building erected elsewhere at a cost of between ten and twelve thousand dollars, we felt that this tender was too high entirely. Then on October 15, 1949, another tender was received from R. Osterberg, 2022 Seventh Avenue South, Lethbridge, Alberta. This was in the amount of $12,560.84. Please find attached copies of two letters (a) from Regional Supervisor Gooderham and (b) from Mr. Osterberg, concerning the delay in forwarding his tender to the Department.\n\nEven though Mr. Osterberg's tender was delayed in reaching the Department, I would recommend that a submission to Council be made covering the acceptance of his tender, in view of the fact that it is $10,000 lower than that of Bennett & White Calgary Limited.\n\nDirector.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, October 21, 1949.\n\nREQUEST FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL:\n\nRequesting authority to accept the tender of\nR.

MACKAY\n\nRe: Peigan Indian Day School\n\nAs you are aware, we recently advertised for tenders for the erection of the above one-room school and attached teacher's residence at Brocket, Alberta.\n\nThese advertisements were for a standard one-room school with attached teacher's residence, in accordance with Plan 388. This school has been costing from $8,750.00 up to $13,000.00, depending on the location.\n\nOnly one tender was received for the erection of this school, that of Bennett and White, Ltd., Calgary, Alberta. It was for the amount of $22,291.00. This is so much higher than any other tender which we have received for this type of school, that I cannot recommend its acceptance.\n\nThis is not an isolated reserve, in fact a good highway passes within 200 yards of the school site. I would suggest that we advertise again for tenders next spring, and if none are received within a proper price range, that we consider the possibility of erecting this school by day labour with the Department purchasing all the material.\n\nBernard F.

Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Peigan Indian Day School\n\nOn receipt of your army signal message of August 18, I immediately got in touch with Superintendent McMillan, Peigan Agency, who informed me that although he would prefer a new school as per plan 888, it would be impossible to use the community hall as it is when the weather becomes cold.\n\nHowever, if a new school could be completed and ready for occupancy by January 1, the opening of this day school would not be delayed to any great extent as it is not anticipated that the community hall could be made ready for use before that date.\n\nIt would therefore appear that the completion of a new school by January 1 would be the best plan.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\n\nP.S.

E. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRef: Peigan Indian Day School\nRef: yours to Superintendent McMillan\ndated August 3, file 715-5 (E)\n\nI spent the 5th and 6th on the Peigan Reserve and concluded that it would be unwise to advertise for a teacher until the Community Hall is repaired.\n\nYou have received tenders for this work from Mr. McMillan and it is hoped that they are acceptable.\n\nI not only inspected the building but met Contractor Neilson who is prepared to do all the carpenter work, also principal of the Highland Motors and saw a Shafco oil fired Heater, similar to that which he is prepared to install in this building.\n\nI was favourably impressed with Mr. Neilson. I learned from him that the insulation contract is submitted by an associate. The Shafco Oil Heater, in my opinion, is ideal for this building and the cost of fuel will be less than coal. Furthermore, no fireman is needed.\n\nAs for the wiring and lighting of this building, there appears to be no alternative but to follow the provincial regulations although the building is already wired. Should these contracts be approved, it will then take some time before the work can be completed. I doubt if the school can be ready for pupils before the first of January.\n\nOn this assumption, I suggested to the Superintendent and the Principal of the R.C. School that pupils be taken into the residential schools in September without undue consideration of a day school. It is expected that there will be at least 30 pupils who cannot be enrolled at the residential schools but to designate who must wait for the day school will cause confusion. When the day school is opened, a readjustment of residential and day pupils can be readily made. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to Mr. McMillan.\n\nG. H.

McMillan, Indian Superintendent, Brocket, Alberta; and G. H. Gooderham, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Post Office Building, Calgary, Alberta.\nIndian Affairs Branch Dept of Mines & Resources Ottawa.\n\nAttention B F Neary Esqr.\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th inst, re the establishment of a Day School at the Peigan Indian Agency, and your wire to Mr Gooderham of July 26th re requisitions on the repairing of Peigan Indian Community Hall to make it suitable for a day school, I have been in touch with contractors for the necessary bids, and list of materials since the receipt of your letter of July 4th.\n\nClassroom. Gunner Nielson has been in touch with this work for some time and on Tuesday checked it over with another contractor, and has promised me a list of material and labor bid, as soon as possible, which should be before the last of the month.\n\nLighting. Pincher Creek Electric has checked this hall up with the idea of fluorescent lights at the East End of the Hall where the classroom will be situated the rest of the Hall will be ordinary lighting. The man checking this work had to get the instructions of the Electrical Insp. for the Province, which has just arrived, and his bid will be turned in immediately.\n\nHeating. The only mode of heating for this Classroom will have to be the Blower type, run by oil, and Mr Stark of Highland Motors, who has one in his Garage, and is the Agent has written away for price and full information which I will pass on as soon as received.\n\nOver.\nDesks. I am requisitioning for the desks on the basis of ten small, ten large, and ten medium.\n\nBlackboards. I am requisitioning, for two blackboards, one 10' and one 6' which should be enough.\n\nJanitor supplies. I have noted the authority to purchase the necessary equipment for cleaning the school etc up to $50.00\n\nTeacherage. As I have been advised that the Sacred Heart School authorities, have been unable to procure a Sister for the Day school, I have asked the Contractor to include in his bid the completion of the two rooms in the West end of the Community Hall. It would therefore be necessary to furnish the rooms for the type of Teacher hired.\n\nClassroom Supplies. Your remarks are noted.\n\nTeacher. As the Sisters have received word from their Headquarters their inability to supply a Teacher, owing to a shortage, will the advertisement be placed by the Branch, in the papers, or do you wish me to place the notice in the papers in the south of the Province. If so may I have a rough copy of the ad, I should put in, as I notice the salary schedule for First Class Certificate calls for 1680 to 3120, and the second class from 1560 to 2040.\n\nI sincerely hope to get this work done and have school ready before Sept 1st, however with the inability of getting any other but Local contractors to bid, I feel I am on the spot, as we have two or three projects to complete, and a chance of the same contractor getting the bid, may cause loss of time.\n\nAnthony McMillan\nSuperintendent.\n\nWill Air Mail requisitions and bids as received.\n\nCopy to G.H. Gooderham Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\nMr. A. McMillan,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.,\n\nPeigan Indian Day School\n\nAn Order-in-Council has now been passed for the establishment of this school, and it can be referred to as the \"Peigan Indian Day School\" with code number 715, for requisitions, vouchers, etc.\n\nWe will expect to receive from you in the near future, the bill of materials which the Departmental Purchasing Agent can order.\n\nClassroom: We are agreed to leave the classroom as one-room, in order to avoid any extra installation.\n\nLighting: We are prepared to install fluorescent lights in the main classroom but it is only to be installed in the part of the room where the pupils will be working. It is not felt that more than thirty pupils will be enrolled and, therefore, we do not need to provide lighting for the whole room.\n\nHeating: Please submit a requisition for a blower type of unit which will be sufficient to heat the main classroom.\n\nDesks: Please order sufficient desks in small, medium and large sizes to cover your requirements.\n\nBlackboards:\n\nPlease submit a requisition covering blackboards which come in 4\u00bd foot widths. Standard lengths are 6\", 8\", 10\", and 12\".\nJanitor Supplies: You can make local purchase of $50. of such items as toilet paper, paper towels, soap, brooms, dust bane and smaller items required to get the classroom and teacherage clean.\n\nTeacherage: I understand that the teacher will be living in the Sacred Heart Residential School and will commute daily to the day school. If this is correct, then the only furniture we will require for the teacher's room will be a table, chairs, linoleum rug, curtains and possibly a studio couch. Would you please confirm this so that we can requisition for this furniture.\n\nClassroom Supplies:\n\nWe are arranging to forward a standard list of classroom supplies. The teacher may requisition for other items as soon as she reports for duty in September.\n\nTeachers:\n\nPlease find attached an application form which you may have the teacher complete and return here when she has been nominated. This will then enable us to state her salary in accordance with our teachers' schedule.\n\nIn view of the short supply of desks and blackboards, I would ask you to requisition for these as soon as possible.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEnclos:\nBPW/HM\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. TRACK\n\nPlease send the standard list of school supplies to:\n\nMr. A. McMillan,\nPeigan Indian Day School,\nBrocket, Alberta\n\nThis is a new school just established and there will be some thirty children in attendance with about twenty in Grade 1. It will be a Catholic school, but I would suggest that you supply the Basic Readers only as there will be a few Protestant children in attendance.\n\nBernard F.

On speaking to Mr Peltier about it, he immediately became very impertinent, and I suspended him. Prior to this, the Indians had complained that the Teacher had exposed his person during School hours, but Mr Peltier's excuse was, that this was owing to his trousers being short of buttons, so I let the matter drop.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\n(signed) Chas de Cazes\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Indian Commissioner\n\nRegina.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of a letter from Mr Agent De Casse in which he states that he suspended the teacher of the Joseph's School, Mr Peltier; and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the Agent's action, and the teacher should be dismissed at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nCopy\n\nEdmonton Indian Agency,\nJan 14th. 1896\n\nEnclosed herewith please find the School Returns of\nthe St Albert and Joseph Schools for December quarter.\nIt will be observed that those from the latter school\nare made out in anything but a proper manner.

There appear to be plenty of children of school age on the reserve and the Department considers that some steps should be taken to secure a more regular attendance, as unless some improvement takes place it would not be justified in continuing the school.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg,\nMan.\nLake St Ann\nFeb. 26th 1905.\n\nJ.

David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nThe Indians of Joseph's Band have promised me that if a day school be provided on that reserve, that they will guarantee an average attendance of 18 children for 10 months in the year and are prepared to sign a paper to that effect. In the event of these promises not being fulfilled they are willing that their children be sent to the Industrial or boarding schools.\n\nThe salary for a man and wife to fill this position would be about $900 to $1000 a year. The man to look after the destitute. The cost of school furniture would be about $70 to $100.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nP.S. I would be glad to hear the decision of the Dept. in this matter so I can tell the Indians at treaty time.\nOttawa, July 26, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Indians of Joseph's Band in the Edmonton Agency have applied to the Department for the re-opening of the day school there.\n\nI would ask you to be good enough to look into this matter when you next visit the Edmonton Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Markle, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRed Deer, Alta.\nSir,\n\nFearing I would not have the time to spare to visit the Joseph's Band of Indians I asked Mr. Agent Verreau to interview them on this subject and to get an assurance from them that they would regularly send their children to the school, if reopened, and in event of them failing, after once given a chance, to carry out their promises that it would be understood at the outset that the school would be closed and the children of school age, and in good health, taken to one of the boarding or industrial schools.\n\nMr. Verreau has reported about as follows:\n\nThere are 33 boys and 19 girls aged from 7 to 14 years members of the Joseph's Band. They reside from 1/2 to 4 miles from the site of the old school, most of them within 1 mile.\n\nMr. Verreau states that the Indians promised him that they would agree to keep up an average attendance of 18 for 10 months of the year providing they were given a school and a free mid day meal. Mr. Verreau states that it would cost $100.00 for the necessary repairs to the old school building and that it would, too, be necessary to have the children gathered, conveyed, to the school each morning, that a married couple would expect about $75.00 or $65.00 per month and rations to do this work\u2014woman as teacher and man outside work. I observe from his letter that he fears the promise\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\npromise he states was given by the parents, i.e., average attendance or 18 for 10 months per annum, would not be of long duration and that it would soon be necessary to place them within one of the residential schools.\n\nMy impression is that the Indians, or many of them, would soon forget their promises and that the attendance would soon be nearer 8 than 18, that during the short winter days they would not be in the class room more than an hour or two and that little real progress would be made. If the Department, however, is desirous of testing the zeal of these Indians to secure an education for their children the expenditure of about $1500.00 will prove whether they are in earnest, and if they are not action might be taken then, if thought desirable, to secure a number of the children for residential schools.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp.\nOttawa, October 6, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo in reference to the opening of the day school for the Joseph's Band, Edmonton Agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to incur the expenditure suggested by the Agent in providing the services of a man and his wife, giving a mid-day meal and conveying the children to school. If, however, the Indians are thoroughly in earnest in their request to have the school re-opened the Department might favourably consider the appointment of a teacher. It is taken for granted that the old building is available and in a fair state of repair, although it will be necessary to provide some furnishings. Most of these children reside within such a distance from the school that they will be able to attend without being conveyed. I would ask you to take the matter up again along these lines with the Agent. Would it be possible for a single teacher to find accommodation?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

This sum is divided as follows:\n\n- Mudding house and whitewashing same: $20.00\n- 6 seats 13' long: $15.00\n- 3 desks, 14' long: $15.00\n- Other furnishings: $15.00\n\nTotal: $65.00\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nRef.

Owing to the large number of children of school age on this reserve the Department is prepared to assume obligation for a salary of a teacher if the church authorities will nominate a satisfactory person. As soon as they are in a position to do this the necessary authority for the repair will be given. I would ask you, therefore, to take the matter up with them with a view to securing the services of a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A.

Dec. 1 1904.\n\nMr. Verreau, Indian Agent.\n\nDear Mr. Verreau,\n\nWith reference to our conversation the other night, I beg to say that I do not feel justified to recommend any person for the position of teacher of a day school at Lake St. Ann Reserve. I do not think that there is a person living, man or woman who could make a success of such a school at said place.\n\nAnd permit me to disclose my frank opinion on this question of day schools for our Indians. Of course I leave out altogether the question of the Reserves in Eastern Canada, the conditions of which I do not know but for our Indians in these western countries I know that they are not prepared as yet for day schools even of an improved system and they will not be prepared for a long time yet until several generations of the parents have been trained in Boarding Schools. Everyone acquainted with the circumstances of our Indian Reserves in the west very well know that Day schools here would be only a sham; the attendance would be illusory and these schools would stand there as a pretext not to send the children to Boarding Schools.\n\nThe training in Boarding Schools is certainly more easy, more satisfactory and more thorough and it would be a great pity to do anything that would tend to deprive the Indians of such Training.\n\nThis is my honest opinion on the whole subject and I would be pleased if you would send a copy of this letter to the Department.\n\nBelieve me Dear Mr. Verreau,\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n(Signed) Emile J. Legal.\nOttawa, January 12, 1912.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Indians of Joseph's Band (Alexis Reserve) have applied for the re-opening of the day school on their reserve. There are reported to be 42 children of school age; most of whom reside within one mile of the school. An examination of the returns from the St. Joseph's Industrial School and the St. Albert Boarding School does not show any children enrolled from this band. The Department has expressed its willingness to repair the buildings and provide the salary of a teacher.\n\nA copy of Your Lordship's communication in reference to the re-opening of this school has been forwarded through the office of the Inspector. The Department, while fully appreciating Your Lordship's attitude towards day schools in the diocese and the reasons therefor, is of opinion that the re-opening of this day school would be of benefit to these Indians, as they are evidently not in favour of sending their children to the residential schools. If the Indians are sincere in their representations a fairly successful school should be the result.\n\nIt is said that accommodation for a teacher is available, and, if Your Lordship will nominate a competent person, the Department will provide a fair salary and call upon its officials to give every assistance possible towards the carrying on of the work. With the co-operation of the\n\nRight Rev. E. J. Legal,\nBishop of St. Albert,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nDepartmental officials and the Missionaries there should be little doubt as to the success of the school.\n\nIn view of the circumstances as above set forth I should be glad to further hear from Your Lordship in reference to the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nTo the Secretary of the Indian Department,\nOttawa.\n\nSt. Albert, Alta., Jan. 28, 1912\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your communication of the 12th inst. (File No. 116689/1.) concerning the project of reopening the Day School on Alexis Reserve (Lake Louise), I beg to say that my opinion based on my whole experience of Indian ways in the West, is so strongly adverse to these day schools, that I feel it is my duty bound, not to encourage in any way such a move.\n\nOf course, I have no power for preventing one more trial and one more certain failure.\n\nI do not know of any person whom I could recommend for the position of teacher, and there is no one to whom I could conscientiously recommend to accept the position, knowing as I know, how thankless and disheartening would be the task.\n\nI have the honor to remain, dear Sir,\n\nYour very obediently,\n\nEmile J. Royer\nArchbishop of St. Albert.\nOttawa, February 5, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of December 16th, last, and previous correspondence in connection with the re-opening of the day school on the Alexis Reserve I beg to say that the Department has noted the contents of the enclosure written by His Lordship Bishop Legal and has also received a letter direct from His Lordship of the same purport, that is, that he is not prepared to nominate a teacher for a day school there because he considers that there is no chance of making it a success.\n\nNotwithstanding the attitude of His Lordship the Department would like you to look carefully into this matter when you make your inspection of the Edmonton Agency and report further.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Markle, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRed Deer, Alta.\nSir,\n\nAs directed in your letter of the 5th instant I have inquired regarding the possibilities of operating a day school on the St. Joseph's Reserve and the evidence I have gathered leads me to the conclusion that the school, if opened, would not be a success unless it is thought that the children could make satisfactory progress by attending school for only two months, from about May 1st until about September 1st, for I have been assured that this is the only period of the year that the majority of this band are or ever were on their reserve. Then, moreover, would the children of this reserve attend a day school regularly even during the whole time referred to.\n\nMr. Agent Verreau seems to entertain the view that if he could spare the time during the months alluded to spend 10 days at a time, and on two or more occasions, at that reserve during the period the Indians are at home that he could get the greater number of the children of school age of this reserve into one of the boarding schools if you so desired.\n\nThe reason given by Mr. Verreau that he has not spent more time at Joseph's and other reserve is because he has no confidence in his assistants\u2014Mr. Rance.\n\nI am of the opinion that His Lordship has given you a very reasonable prophecy of what would be the outcome if an attempt was made to operate a day school on Joseph's Reserve.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, February 25, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to previous correspondence in connection with the opening of the day school on the Alexis Reserve in your Agency I beg to say that, in view of the reports made to the Department as to the probable success, it is not considered advisable to re-open the school at the present time.\n\nMr. Inspector Markle states that you are of the opinion that you might be able to recruit a number of the children from this reserve for the boarding schools and I would ask you to use your best endeavors in this direction during the coming summer and report success to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nUrbain Verreau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6340)\n\nFile 708-1, part 1\nSaddle Lake - Goodfish Lake. 1909 - 1949\n\nFile 708-3, part 1\nSaddle Lake - Goodfish Lake - Salaries.\n1912 - 1925\n\nFile 708-5, part 1\nSaddle Lake - Goodfish Lake School - 1886 - 1924\nBuilding Accounts.\n\nFile 708-8, part 1\nSaddle Lake - Goodfish Lake School - Teachers'\nResidence. 1913 - 1924\n\nFile 708-9, part 1\nSaddle Lake - Goodfish Lake School - School Lot.\n1916\n\nFile 709-5, part 1\nSaddle Lake - Alexander School - Buildings.\n1948 - 1949\n\nFile 710-5, part 1\nSaddle Lake - Big Horn School - Nordegg.\n1948 - 1949\n\nFile 711-1, part 1\nSaddle Lake - Louis Bull Day School. 1899 - 1949\n\nFile 711-5, part 1\nSaddle Lake - Louis Bull Day School - Buildings\nand Accounts. 1900 - 1949\n\nFile 715-5, part 1\nSaddle Lake - Peigan Buildings & Accounts.\n1949\n\nFile 717-1, part 1\nSaddle Lake - Alexis (Joseph) School. 1895 -\n1912\n\nFile 717-5, part 1\nSaddle Lake - Alexis (Joseph) School - Buildings\nand Accounts. 1949\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 717 - 5 VOLUME 1\n\nSUBJECT ALEXIS DAY SCHOOL\nBUILDINGS, ACCOUNTS, ETC.\n\nCORRESPONDENCE FROM APRIL 49 TO DEC. 49\n\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE TO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\n\nNOTE: For subsequent correspondence relevant to the subject matter of this closed file see\nFILE 6-1 13-1 13-8 VOLUME 1\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\u2014 INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH \u2014\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 717 - 5 VOLUME 1\n\nSUBJECT ALEXIS DAY SCHOOL\nBUILDINGS, ACCOUNTS, ETC.\n\nCORRESPONDENCE FROM APRIL 49\nTO DEC. 49\n\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE\nTO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\n\nNOTE: For subsequent correspondence relevant to the subject matter of this closed file see\nFILE 6-1 13-1 13-8 VOLUME 1\n| TO       | DATE     | BY   | DATE | C.R. | FILED BY |\n|----------|----------|------|------|------|----------|\n| S.J.A    | 15/4/49  | EM   |      |      | EM       |\n| W.P.     | 8/1/50   | EM   | 16/1 |      | EM       |\n| H.E.     | 16/7/60  | EM   |      |      | EM       |\n| Col.

Building,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nAlexie Indian Day School.\n\nReference your letter of 12 December.\n\nWe have noted the circumstances surrounding the fire which destroyed the teacherage at this school. Fortunately, we have sufficient funds to re-erect this building and I would ask that you immediately take the following action:\n\n(a) Advise the Department as to the amount of an accountable advance required for the cutting of new logs. You might have the Indians start cutting these logs at once.\n\n(b) Submit, by Airmail, a requisition for the millwork and lumber required for the teacherage.\n\n(c) Arrange to clean up the house owned by the Department at Glenovis Village.\n\n(d) Get a firm tender from Mr. Pope, the Glenovis Postmaster, for transportation of Mr. Deckery to the school for each teaching day only.\n\n(e) Submit a requisition for the fuel needed.\n\nWe agree that it is very likely that the fire was caused by an overheated stove pipe. Therefore, Mr. Deckery\nwill have to be very careful in the new teacherage to ensure that his draughts are controlled properly. Mr. Bergen might take additional precautions in erecting the chimney in the new teacherage.\n\nI have today placed a requisition with the Departmental Purchasing Agent for a new set of house furnishings and would suggest that you contact the T. Eaton Company as soon as you receive the purchase order and arrange immediate delivery.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Gooderham\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nAlexis Indian Day School\n\nPlease find hereunder two self-explanatory reports from Mr. Indian Superintendent Robertson and Mr. Regional Supervisor Gooderham concerning the fire which destroyed the teacherage at the above Indian school.\n\nIt would seem that this building was destroyed by an over-heated stove and that every reasonable precaution had been taken in erecting the teacherage.\n\nYou will note that a building is available which could be used as a teacherage until a new one can be erected. I would recommend that Mr. Gooderham's suggestions be followed and that this building be used pending the erection of a new log teacherage.\n\nWe have funds available for the purchase of new furniture and for the continued operation of this school.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nConfirming my telegram of today, I regret to advise that the Alexis Reserve teacherage and furnishings were completely destroyed by fire yesterday, Sunday, December 11/49.\n\nI received a long distance telephone call from the teacher, Mr. Dockery, at 2 P.M. saying that the teacherage had been destroyed by fire. Mr. Bergen, the man who erected the buildings, has been working at the Stony Plain Reserve and I arranged to pick up Mr. Bergen and Mr. Callihoo, Farming Instructor at Stony Plain Reserve, and drove out to Alexis Reserve, to see if we could ascertain the cause of the fire.\n\nMr. Dockery states that he had been doing some work in the school and on his return about 11 A.M. they smelled smoke and noticed smoke coming from the wall, in the living room, around the opening to the chimney. They doused it with water and the smoke stopped. Unfortunately neither of this old couple is very active and Mr. Dockery went to call some Indians to have help available if it should start up again. Mrs. Dockery states that after her husband left she could hear fire in the ceiling over the living room and by the time Mr. Dockery got back with help the building was a mass of flame. One of the Indians managed to get out the dinette table and four chairs and the arm-chair from the living room, and Mrs. Dockery got out the blankets from the bed. Everything else was a complete loss.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Dockery are under the impression that the fire was caused through some fault of the chimney but both Mr. Bergen and myself are satisfied that it started from an overheated pipe from the heater in the living room. The chimneys in these buildings are constructed of cement chimney blocks on a cement foundation.\nThe blocks are well cemented together and the chimney plastered with cement on the outside to eliminate any possibility of cracks. We inspected the entire chimney in the School building and it is standing up perfectly.\n\nThe chimney in this building was in the kitchen, against the living room wall, with an opening through the wall for the pipe from the living room heater. This opening was some six inches wider than the pipe and was well insulated with asbestos board both around the opening and on the ceiling above the pipe, and should have been quite safe. There was a wood fire in the heater and the only cause we can figure is that they forgot to close off the drafts and it got going too hard.\n\nAs there was no other living quarters for them on the Reserve, I brought Mr. and Mrs. Dockery to Winterburn and for the present they are staying in the teacher's residence for Stony Plain #2 School. Mr. Leskiw is driving out and back from his home in Edmonton and is not using his living quarters as yet, this winter. The School at Alexis Reserve will have to be closed in the meantime. However, if some arrangement for living quarters can be made by the first of January, this will only mean one week extra Christmas Holidays.\n\nThe Department own a fire room house in Glenevis village, about three miles from the School. The Health Services are using one room for a dispensary and examination room and we are using two rooms for a ration store house. If a new set of furnishings could be ordered at once, two or three of the rooms in this house could be cleaned up and would make quite comfortable living quarters. This would, of course, necessitate the arranging of transportation to and from the School for Mr. Dockery. Mr. Pope, the Postmaster at Glenevis, operates a small motor livery and I think arrangements could be made with him to take Mr. Dockery out and back from the School for between $30.00 and $40.00 per month as long as the road is not blocked with snow. Should he be unable to get through, similar arrangements could be made to have an Indian drive Mr. Dockery by sleigh. This is the only method I can see of getting the School in operation again by the first of the year. The attendance at the School has been much better than I had anticipated and I am very anxious to keep it going without too long a break, while awaiting replacement of the residence provided, of course, the Department decides to make such replacement, and for which there does not appear to be any alternative.\n\nShould you decide to follow the plan I have suggested, it will not be necessary to purchase new buffet table and chairs or a kitchen range. The range in the burned residence was destroyed but the one purchased for Stony Plain #2 can be used at Alexis as the Stony Plain #2 residence had a range already installed in it and this can remain there for the present at least.\n\nCon't.\nWill you please let me have your instructions in the matter as early as possible.\n\nMr. Dockery is willing to live in the Glenevis house and drive to and from the School.\n\nE. A. Robertson,\nSuperintendent.\n\nEAR/\nc.c. G. H. Gooderham Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor,\nIndian Agencies,\nCALGARY, Alberta.\nAIR MAIL\n\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Alexis Indian Day School, Edmonton Agency.\nYour file 42110-9-2\n\nYou have been advised by wire that the log teacherage at this school was burned to the ground on the 11th inst. In a phone call today, Mr. Robertson states that he believes that it was caused by an over-heated stove and it is inferred that the teacher and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Dockery, were in Edmonton at the time.\n\nThey have been moved temporarily into the cottage supplied for the teacher of the second school at Winterburn as the present teacher is a bachelor and does not occupy it. This is many miles away from the Alexis School, therefore the Alexis School is closed.\n\nIn the village of Glenavis which is situated on the north side of the Alexis Reserve and at the head of a road which we built through the reserve past the day school, Indian Affairs and the Department of Health and Welfare purchased a house which is used as a rationing and clinical centre. It is substantially built and with very little cleaning up will make a very comfortable home. It is a two-story building and rations and medical supplies can be transferred to the part which is not needed for living quarters. It is our recommendation that this house be made the teacherage until such time as a new one can be erected beside the school.\n\nMr. Robertson believes that the services of a local Glenavis citizen can be secured for about $30.00 a month to take the teacher back and forth to the school which is three miles south of the village. This would be done by car when roads were passable and by sleigh at other times.\n\nAs all the furnishings were burned a new supply must be purchased immediately. Stoves will not be needed as there is a heater in the house and the cook stove supplied for the Stony Plain cottage was not set up there since there was already a departmental cooking range in it. The remainder of the standard furnishings, plus blinds, will be required. These must be obtained as quickly as possible as the new teacher for Stony Plain will want to occupy the Stony Plain house on or before the first of January. I suggest you give the Superintendent of the Edmonton Agency authority to purchase the furnishings required for Alexis, in Edmonton. If necessary, he could get prices from the T. Eaton Co. Ltd., the Hudson's Bay and Woodwards and wholesale.\nWhile Mr. Dockery is at Winterburn, it is suggested that he be required to assist Miss Hirondelle.

Ottawa\n\nSir,\n\nWhen at Wabunum Reserve recently I was requested by the Chief and Band of Indians resident there to place before your Department their earnest wish for a Boarding School. They claimed that there are people of the same faith with them at Stony Plain, and Pius, Lac La Biche and also at Lake St. Anne who would send their children to the school. They also claim that at this present time they have 17 children at the Red Deer Industrial and also some 30 children of school age on the Reserve for whom they desire education at home. They claim that they have been told that the Red Deer School is to be closed and that schools are to be established at Hobema and Spraddle Lake, and Morley and that...\nAs the nearest of these would still be one hundred miles from them they do not desire to send their children so far away as also among an alien people. They say that now they have grown to a strong appreciation of the advantages of schools and humbly ask your department to throw funds for them on their own Reserve and adjacent to these other Reserves which are near to them.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted,\n\nJames Fairlie\n\nJohn McDougall\nOttawa, December 20, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant advising the Department of the request of the Indians of the Wabamun Reserve that a boarding school be established for the education of their children.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev.

Therefore, we, the undersigned Indians of Pauli Reserve, as well as the Indians of Lac St. Anne, Riviere Du Barry, Stony Plains, and Buck Lake, whose names are attached to this petition, pledge ourselves to support the school by sending our children.\n\nWilliam Burwash 2\nPierre Kotanie 1\nPierre Kowawas 1\nSamuel Akie 1\n\nEdward Akie 2\nPeter Akie 1\nJohn Kiefel 1\nTherona Burwash 1\nAdvent Kotanie 1\n\nLottie Burwash 1\nLouise Kachipot 1\nAlexander Kowawas 1\nThomas Bighead 1\nCalgary, Aug. 3rd, 1910\n\nThe Secretary of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received the attached list of names of children from the Chief of the White Whale Reserve with a request that I forward this on to you.\n\nThese Indians are very much interested in the education of their youths and as four or possibly five districts Reserves would be served and my name helpful in the establishment of a Mission School Boarding School on Paul's Reserve at White Whale Lake I humbly trust that your department will take this matter into your serious consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJohn M.

SCOTT.\nIndian Residential School\nUNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\n\nREV. J. F. WOODSWORTH B.A.\nPRINCIPAL\n\nMr. R. T. Ferrier;\nDepartment of Indian Affairs;\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI enclose herewith a letter I just received from Mr. Berner after he had visited our mission at Hobbema. This whole story of a day school seems very unlikely as far as the sanction of the Department is concerned, however I thought I would write you to find out if anything has reached the ears of the Department. This agitation on the part of the Indians of Hobbema is perennial and usually members of our church bodies immediately fall for it. Our Conference will be held in Edmonton of 27th Inst when undoubtedly the matter will come up. I would appreciate an official letter from you dealing with the matter in a definite way because I know by experience how difficult it is to quiet an agitation once commenced. If you cannot get a letter to me in time a telegram might be sufficient until the letter arrived.\n\nI do not think it necessary to see Fred Littlepoplar as he is an agitator, and I have an idea that the Agent knows nothing about this proposal. If this request is in order I shall await a reply at your convenience.\n\nSincerely Yours;\n\nJ.F. Woodsworth.\nMy Dear Brother Woodsworth,\n\nI have had a nice visit here and I find the general atmosphere very encouraging... Caston was in good spirits and there are many signs of improvement. However, there is one matter, however, which I think you ought to know so you may use your own judgment as to the timeliness of your own visit and I want to know now if you will give me the impression that the Department has practically promised them a day school or practically promised them about half an hour of School the House. There is talk of gathering of Indians at Union Lake early in June and this matter... which was brought up there, seems to settle my... Social meeting of Indians in... enthusiasm over recently on resolved the matter to... clarity and brought the matter to... attention of that body desiring the promise that the matter will be brought up at Conference... Very wisely ten... Caution is keeping out of this. But I think you ought to be informed.\n\nIf you thought you... to be well to drive down before Conference and see what you can... to secure information? Having the... put... to feel how... you. Mrs Young... in here visiting and she... wonderful cough is here visiting and she is wonderful today. She keeps... dine... today. Wishing to all... noon. Introduced and... clerk is here.\n\nMany kind wishes to all,\n\nYours affectionately,\n[Signature]\nArthur Laverne\nOttawa, August 21, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, informing the Department as to the disposal made by you of the Government property at Samson's Indian Day School.\n\nThe 14 double desks and 3 rear seats on hand may be turned over for the use of the Ermineskin's Indian Residential School, and you may arrange to have this done. We note that the sewing machine, which is the property of the Department, is being used by the missionary and is at the mission. This machine may remain at the mission. The stove, pipes, lock and key may also be handed over to the mission. We note that all the other classroom supplies have been handed over to the Ermineskin's Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. G. Askey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter No. II2-7-1, of July 6th last, and disposal of the government property at Samson's Day School. I have the honor to state that all the school books, stationery, and a quantity of raffia, rattan and colored plasticine, have been turned over to the Ermineskin Residential School. The Rev. Principal is also asking for the 14 double desks and three rear seats, to take care of the increase in attendance which he expects at the beginning of the term.\n\nThe sewing machine is the property of the Department, having been purchased in November 1910, Vr.3049 - $30.00 - It has been used by the Missionaries and is at the Mission, it is not in very good repair.\n\nThe stove, pipes, lock and key I would suggest be donated to the Mission as they are set up in the Church.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 6, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing an inventory of the Government property on hand at the Samson's Indian Day School. Regarding the disposal of this material, I beg to say that you may offer same, with the exception of the sewing machine, the stove and the desks, to the Ermineskins Indian Residential School, without charge therefor. If they desire any of these supplies, you may arrange to have them forwarded to that school. The daily register may be destroyed.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state who owns the sewing machine. It is thought that it may have been furnished by the church authorities as we do not appear to have any record of having supplied this article. I shall be glad to have your recommendation as to what should be done with the stove and whether you could arrange for its sale.\n\nThe 14 double desks and 3 rear seats should remain in the school until we can dispose of them to some other school. It is noted that the curtain, the teacher's desk and the clock are of no value.\n\nPlease keep a list of any material transferred to the Ermineskins School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. D. Askay, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nSir,\n\nIn compliance with the instructions of your letter dated May 31st last, No. II7-7-1, I beg to herewith enclose an Inventory of Government Property used in Samson's Day School.\n\nThis school was closed today, and the children who have been attending same will be recruited for the Residential Schools after the summer holidays.\n\nWith reference to your instructions re looking of the doors and windows, I beg to say that Samson's Day School was held in the United Church building, and I am therefore having the light school material moved and stored at the Agency. The stoves and desks I am leaving in the Church building awaiting your instructions.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Asst.

I shall, therefore, be pleased if you will make the necessary arrangements with the local Indian Agent to see that all the Protestant children of school age, who are in good health, are placed in the Edmonton School as soon as possible when the school reopens after the summer holidays. An application and certificate of health should be forwarded for each child.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nN. M.

Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, has forwarded the resignation of Miss Mildred Logan, teacher of the Samson's Indian Day School. Mr. Ferrier at the same time draws attention to the advisability of closing this school and recruiting all the children for the Edmonton Indian Residential School. We are taking this matter up with Mr. Commissioner Graham, and you will, no doubt, receive instructions from him in the matter. You should use every endeavour to have the Protestant children of school age, and who are in good health, sent to the Edmonton School as soon as it opens after the summer holidays.\n\nYou will be good enough to see that the Samson's Day School building is securely locked and the windows strongly fastened. All the classroom supplies should be stored, and, if possible later, it might be possible to have them distributed to other schools. Please forward an inventory of the school desks, blackboards, classroom equipment, etc., on hand when the school closes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.

June 30th, next.\n\nYour suggestion regarding the advisability of closing this school and recruiting the children for the Edmonton Indian Residential School will receive attention. We are requesting Mr. Commissioner Graham and the local Indian Agent to take the necessary action in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T.

The Department is not prepared to close this institution at the present time, as there is an average attendance of approximately 10. We are in correspondence with the Rev. Principal and the Indian Agent, with a view to preparing a list of children who should be placed in the Edmonton Indian Residential School under Section 10 of the Act. When the list for this reserve and those for other reserves in the vicinity of Edmonton are complete, definite instructions will be directed to you concerning the placing of the children in the Edmonton school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nM. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to Department #112-7-1 dated the 17th of December last, with reference to the subject of the proposed closing of the Samson Indian Day School, in which you referred to a list of pupils by Agencies being prepared by the Rev. J.F. Woodsworth upon the receipt of which I was to receive a further communication from you. May I ask if the information you desired to procure is now complete.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 17, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 404-11 of the 8th instant, covering the Public School Inspector's report on the Samson Indian Day School. The Department agrees that consideration to the closing of this school should be given and that the pupils might be recruited for the Edmonton Residential School. The Department discussed this question and the whole subject of increasing the enrolment at the Edmonton Institution with the Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools and I understand the Rev. Mr. Woodsworth is preparing a list of pupils by agencies, which should be in school. When this is to hand, instructions will be directed. It may be necessary to have certain children placed in the school under Section 10 of the Act. At this time the question of closing the Samson Day School will receive attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the Samson Day School, which was inspected by Mr. E.L. Fuller on the 20th of November. The school is taught by Miss Mildred Logan, and is under the auspices of the Methodist Church. The Inspector points out that the teacher is meeting with fair success, but she has not the special training actually required for teaching Indian children.\n\nI would draw your attention to the very poor attendance at this school, the number of children enrolled being 79% of those that should attend, and the average attendance for the month of October 79% of those enrolled.\n\nI understood when the question of erecting the School at Edmonton was decided upon, it was with the understanding that all those Protestant children at the Hobbema Agency would be sent to this school and the Day Schools closed. I think this should be done without delay. The Edmonton School has never been brought up to its capacity or anything like it.\n\nI would draw your attention to what the Inspector says regarding the qualifications of the teacher. This is the usual observation made at most of our schools. On the whole, our teachers are not as well qualified as they should be, and we get recommendations very often from the Inspectors that these teachers should be sent away to receive Normal training.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nExtract from report of Inspector E. L. Fuller on the Samson Day School, dated Nov. 20th, 1925. Original on file 112-7-6.\n\n\"Miss Logan is meeting with fair success. She has not the special training actually required for teaching Indian children. Not enough attention has been paid to teaching the children items of general information which are not found in the course of study. Good progress cannot be made until the children have a 'grounding' in that general knowledge which the average English speaking pupil acquires from his everyday experiences before entering school.\n\n\"One of the essential needs of Indian schools is teachers who are especially qualified both by experience and inherent ability. A good instructor must have a good grounding in the subject of psychology particularly as it applies to Indian children. A few extra dollars spent in securing this type of teacher would in the end prove to be an economy.\n\n\"As already noted, I would recommend that the teacher give instruction with a view to fixing in the minds of her junior pupils those items of general information necessary for an intelligent acquisition of the subject matter outlined in the course of study. The subject of Reading should be strongly stressed. Three or four short lessons a day would not be too much with Indian children who are entering school.\"\nOttawa, Sept. 22, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Methodist Church authorities have nominated the services of Miss Mildred Logan as teacher of the Samson's Indian Day School, in the Hobbema agency. Miss Logan holds a Second Class Professional Certificate for the Province of Nova Scotia. The salary allowed her is at the rate of $800 for the 10 teaching months, supplemented by the bonus provided by law. Miss Logan began duties on the 8th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

We have approved of the appointment of Miss Logan. Her retention in the position will depend upon the success with which she meets in the work. The question of salary will be decided as soon as we receive further information from Mr. Ferrier regarding the qualifications and experience which Miss Logan possesses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. G. Askey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nOttawa, September 9th, 1924.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, recommending the appointment of Miss Mildred Logan as teacher of the Samson's Indian Day School, in the Hobbema Agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the temporary appointment of Miss Logan, her retention in the position to depend upon the success which she achieves in the work. We will await your report as to the qualifications which she possesses, when consideration will be given to the salary which can be allowed her. It is presumed that Miss E. Nightingale, who was offered the position as teacher at this school, did not accept. Your report at an early date stating the qualifications of Miss Logan will be appreciated.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Agent Askey, Hobbema, of the approval of the temporary appointment of Miss Logan, and requesting him to give her every assistance he can upon her taking up duties at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

She will commence duties on the 8th. She has been recommended to me by the missionary in charge. As soon as I receive her qualifications, I will notify the Department regarding her standing.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nTell off [signature]\nTell Ferrier [signature]\nFurther info [signature]\nSalary later\nOttawa, August 12th, 1924.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, recommending the appointment of Miss E. Nightingale, formerly matron at the Brandon Indian Residential School, as teacher of the Samson's Indian Day School, in the Hobbema Agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted you consider that although Miss Nightingale is not a qualified teacher her services would be quite satisfactory at the Samson's Indian Day School. The Department is prepared to give her a trial as teacher, and will allow her salary at the rate of $700 per annum, supplemented by the bonus provided by law. In view of the fact that Miss Nightingale has no professional qualifications, the above salary is all that the Department can allow. This offer is made on the understanding that Miss Sweet, the former teacher, has retired. The Department has had no intimation that she intended to give up duties.\n\nPlease inform the Department as to whether a vacancy for a teacher exists at this school, and, if so, if Miss Nightingale will accept the position at the salary offered and be prepared to take up duties on or about September 2nd, next, when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays. Your early reply will oblige in order that we can inform the local Indian Agent as to the arrangements that have been made for a teacher for the next school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAbout eleven months ago Miss Nightingale who was acting as boys' matron in this institute had her hand poisoned and was taken to the general hospital in the city. Through the excellent surgical, medical and hospital treatment she received her life was saved. It was necessary to amputate her right arm at the elbow. This institution has cared for her and looked after her interests believing that under the circumstances an obligation rested upon us. She has been here for some time recuperating and her health is in very good condition. On account of her handicap however, and other reasons, I think it would not do to have her here permanently. She is a bright, intelligent woman and very good in handling small children. While she is not a certified teacher, I believe she would do excellent work in an Indian day school on a Reserve. The hours would be shorter and her handicap would not be so noticeable.\n\nWe have one school not supplied yet, viz., Hobema in Alberta. Would the Department sanction her appointment there as teacher?\n\nUp to the present I have not consulted her on this proposition but I would like to know if it would be satisfactory to the Department before offering her this position. A reply by return of mail will greatly oblige\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. Ferrier\nOttawa, January 14, 1924.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that the Department does not supply rations to Indian day schools. We would, however, supply certain provisions for the purpose of furnishing the pupils with a midday lunch. These supplies usually consist of flour, rice, beef, tea, sugar, salt and baking powder. I may say that supplies of this nature are only furnished to schools where the teachers undertake to prepare and serve a lunch to the children at midday. We will write Mr. Agent Askey and request him to purchase and deliver a quantity of the above supplies if you will undertake to prepare a midday lunch for the pupils. He will also be instructed, if the purchase is made, to deliver these supplies at the school.\n\nThe janitor's duties consist of sweeping and cleaning the schoolroom each day, scrubbing the same at least once a month, lighting the fires in due time in the morning to have the school-room heated when the pupils arrive, and attending to any snow shovelling that may be required.\n\nThe Department does not supply clothing to school children except in cases of orphan and destitute children specially recommended by the Agent.\n\nIn future it would be well if you would direct enquiries, first, to the local Indian Agent, and if you receive no satisfaction, to the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

As it will be necessary to obtain the services of a teacher to succeed her, I shall be pleased if you will nominate a teacher having the necessary qualifications. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher secured by you should be forwarded for the approval of the Department.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will give this matter your early attention, in order that the services of a teacher can be obtained in time to commence duties when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. W. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask., Jun3 14, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nSamson's Day School.\n\nThis school has been taught by Miss Sweet, who lives just outside the reserve. She however, informed me that she was resigning - her resignation to take effect the 30th of June. There were twenty-four children on the register, but at the time of my visit, there were five girls and seven boys present. Most of the children are in the first grade, five being in the second grade and four in the third. The average attendance has been approximately ten. The teacher informed me that it was very discouraging work on account of the irregular attendance. Naturally a child coming two or three days and then staying home one or two, does not make very rapid progress. This, however, is not Miss Sweet's fault, as she is quite a capable girl, and has given good service. I might add that the children who have attended at all regularly have advanced very well in their studies.\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the SAMSON'S INDIAN School. December 12, 1922.\n\nOnly a few of the children in this school are attending regularly. A number attend scarcely at all, and the majority are very irregular. As a rule the parents are not interested. Compulsion is the only method that will secure satisfactory attendance. The provision of play ground equipment, of which there is none on the school grounds, would be a decided attraction for Indian children and would induce some of them to attend more regularly or their own accord.\n\nE. L. Fuller,\nInsp.\nOttawa, October 9, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 4th instant, I beg to inform you that the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Marion Sweet as teacher of the Samson's Indian Day School, to succeed Mrs. Taylor, who has resigned. The salary allowed Miss Sweet will be at the rate of $800 per annum, plus any bonus provided by law.\n\nMr. Agent Kirby and Mr. Commissioner Graham have been informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Department is not prepared to furnish her with a supply to be used by her in the treatment of cases of ill health.\n\nMr. Agent Kirby is being informed of the appointment of Mrs. Taylor as teacher.\n\nI will be pleased if you will communicate with Mrs. Taylor and arrange for her to take up duties when the school reopens after the holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I have secured the services of Mrs. Taylor who has had some teaching experience and is a graduate nurse. I would like the sanction of the Department to her appointment as teacher and would like also to know if it would be possible for her to have a supply of drugs in order that she may be able to treat any needy cases.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\n\nTF/GD\nOTTAWA, May 26th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nA request has been received from Miss Ida Fairservice, teacher of the Samson's Indian Day School, for permission to close the school for the summer holidays when she has taught the required number of days in the school year, which will include the period the school was closed on account of her illness. She also requests that she be allowed to teach on Saturdays, as she is anxious to get home to visit her father who is seriously ill.\n\nMiss Fairservice is being informed that the Department has no objection to her closing the school for the holidays when she has completed the required number of days, and also if the Indian parents are willing to send their children, she may teach on Saturdays.\n\nShe has been requested to prepare her quarterly return before leaving and send same to you for transmission to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. W. Hickey, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nOTTAWA, May 26th, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, requesting that, for the reason stated in your letter, you be granted permission to close the Samson's Indian Day School for the summer holidays when you have taught the required number of days during the present fiscal year.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that when you have made up the 200 teaching days, which includes the days you were absent on account of illness, you may close the school for the summer holidays. Mr. Agent Kirby is being informed accordingly.\n\nIf the Indian parents are willing to send their children, you may, under the circumstances, teach during Saturdays, but this arrangement is not to form a precedent in the future, and this concession is only granted in order to allow you to complete the full number of days required so that you can get away from your duties in order to be with your father during his illness.\n\nWhen you close school, you should prepare and forward your quarterly return to the local Indian Agent, showing the days taught, attendance, etc., for the present quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMiss Ida Fairserice,\nTeacher, Samson's Indian Day School,\nBox 138, Ponoka, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to write in regard to the severe illness of my father and would therefore ask under such circumstances if I might close school when I have made up 200 days this including the time I was sick but not including authorized holidays throughout the year, or is it compulsory that I have to reach the required number of days in this quarter.\n\nI wish also to say the agent brought me a telegram\nstating father was dying\nas the doctors did not\nthink then he would of\nlived until morning but\nhe rallied through and is\nnow gaining slowly but\nthe doctors say he cannot\nthoroughly recover being as\nhe is forty seventy years\nof age, but he may linger\nfor sometime in that\ncondition.\n\nOn receiving the sad news\nI was unable to travel at\nthat time as I was on\nthe verge of a nervous breakdown\nand wasn't advisable for\nme to attempt such a long\njourney besides I was quite\nreconciled to the fact I\ncould not reach home\nin time to see him in life\nhad he not of taken this\nsudden change.\n\nBy the advice of Rev. R. S.\nGeneral Sup't of Indian Education\nadvising me to teach on Saturdays during this quarter if the children would attend in order to get in the required number of days and also so I could go home at the earliest date possible not knowing how soon the end may come.\n\nOn asking the parents they quite agreed to send their children on Saturdays saying they had no objection whatever and that they would see their children attended so I have been teaching practically every Saturday this quarter. Any consideration which you may give me in this matter will be highly appreciated in this hour of trouble and awaiting an early reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSamson Indian School\nOttawa, April 18, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, regarding the attendance of the Indian children at the Samson Indian Day School and the steps taken by you to obtain a more regular attendance.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has already taken up this matter with Mr. Agent Kirby and he has been informed that if the parents refuse or neglect to send their children to school, it might be well to take exception under Section II, of the Indian Act, as amended at the last session of Parliament, and prosecute the worst offenders.\n\nIt is regretted that you were put to inconvenience owing to lack of fuel. Accounts were received and paid in January last for the purchase of four cords of firewood and three tons of coal. The Department was not aware of any want of fuel.\n\nIt is hoped that you will continue your services as teacher until the end of the present school year, namely, June 30th, and that the conditions complained of by you regarding attendance, fuel, etc., will be satisfactorily adjusted by the agent.\n\nThe testimonials which you enclosed, have been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n551159\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to yours of March 22nd & the request to say I investigated into the statement made by the Indian agent in regard to the attendance at the sameon Indian Day School, and much to say when I asked several of the parents if he had urged them to send their children to school they replied no, he hasn't said anything to me concerning our children attending school. I must say he didn't\nvisit and inspect the school last month therefore I was unable to ask him about this matter also, because as I haven't had the opportunity of seeing him since December, I am glad these matters are receiving attention.\n\nI wish also to state I am awaiting a reply from Rev. P. A. of Lewis, Brandon Dept. of Indian Education in regard to this also as I am leaving the work after this term is not before, but I'm to wait until I hear from him in the matter, but I do not intend remaining here to be used in the rude manner in which I have been used I have to\nbe respected as a teacher and I have done the work to the best of my ability and would offer myself to be able to get all the results. I am certainly discouraged I have been free from result of my work but which caused my illness and just came through with my life.\n\nSecond I've spent already over $150 in surgery etc. for the children. In order to get them to attend more regularly and I have to teach the children both truthfulness and cleanliness and this has certainly been a hindrance to my work and no example whatever to them and not justice to me and they do all the thanks spare for all my efforts in\ntraining them to be better Canadian citizens. I would uphold anything for betterment of the children, but not for worse. This is my eighth year teaching in an Indian and half white school two in an Indian and half sending references from Inspector to Board on my part work and I think you will quite understand how I must feel in this matter. I feel badly over this as this work is strenuous enough without having this to contend with and I am very sorry this has happened, as I shall not come into the work again but I hope the one taking my place in this work will make\na better success than I have. I wish also to say I had an average of 27 anyway last year at Okane River Indian Day School and with great success and would only too gladly like to have the same result here. I wish also to say before closing that the children from attending the Bay School here except they will attend some steps to compel them to come will have to be enforced as some of them have already laughed and said several times what story before when telling them if they would not send their children to a day school they would have to go up.\na Boarding School as it was useless money trying to do anything with them without education. I would advise in regard to this matter if they still insist in not sending their children to school to have them warned if they do not send their children to a day school they will be taken to a Boarding School and this carried out but let them have the privilege of a day school first. Don't wait well what will happen and not a story which they will hear again as they said in times past for I would advise charging their money or part of it deducted from those not sending\ntheir children to school\nand living within a\nreasonable distance\nand also leave them\nadvised as to their\nand if they do not\nsend their children\ncarry it out and I think\nthey would then see,\ntheir children attended\nif this could be done.\nwhich I am only giving\nmy opinion in this matter.\nor the parents if they\nalso have a child as they\nwill have to be compelled\nto attend I am begging\nthis to your wise discretion\nand I might also say\nI remain in my terms\nbut here I will gladly\nadvise the parents so\nthese children in any\nway you may give\nme authority to act\nto have them attend\nschool, and if you deem this worthy of attention please address me what to do in this matter and I shall attend to same next month after Rev. R. Taylor is through at College so I can get him to interpret for me. Thanking you for your kind attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIda Hainsworth\nTeacher\nLamoreaux Indian Day School.\nCopy of Sandy C.

(Rev.) J. C. Jones\nOttawa, March 22, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nIn your report on the Samson's Indian Day School for the month of January, last, you stated as follows: \"I am trying to get a larger attendance, but am not receiving much assistance from Miss Fairservice.\" This matter was drawn to her attention and she was informed that it was part of the teacher's duties to encourage the children in their attendance in every way possible and that she should use every effort on her part to that end.\n\nA reply has been received from Miss Fairservice in which she takes exception to your statement. She states that she takes a deep interest in the children attending the school and that, upon her arrival, she drove around the reserve in company with Rev. R. C. Taylor and visited the homes of the parents who were not sending their children to school and she has also given you a list of the children who failed to attend.\n\nThe attendance at this school is very irregular and it might be well for you to again inform the parents that it is expected that their children will attend regularly. In cases where they refuse or neglect to send their children to school, it might be well to take action under Section 11 of the Indian Act, as amended at the last session of Parliament, and prosecute the worst offenders.\n\nThe teacher has also complained about the condition of the biscuits supplied. She states that on opening some of the boxes she found they had been badly damaged by the mice and were not fit for use.\n\nShe has also complained about the wood supplied and that, as it has not been properly cut for use, the school-room has been very cold and she claims that as a result she developed bronchitis.\n\nIn January, last, an account was forwarded by you for four cords of firewood and three tons of coal. It is not understood why there should be complaints regarding the fuel. You should take these matters up with the teacher and make satisfactory arrangements regarding the fuel and the biscuits.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. W. Kirby, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbs, Alta.\nOttawa, March 22, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant regarding the matter of attendance of the Indian children at the Samson's Indian Day School and containing a statement as to the activities taken by yourself in order to induce the Indian children to attend.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the efforts taken by you are noted. It is not expected that you will perform the duties of a truant officer, yet the Department will be pleased if, on every opportunity, you will impress upon the Indian parents the benefits to be derived by a regular attendance of their children and continue in your efforts to promote the same.\n\nWith reference to your report concerning the condition of the biscuits received and also the wood supply, I beg to say that these matters will receive attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Ida Fairservice,\nTeacher,\nSamson's Indian Day School,\nBox 138,\nPonoka, Alta.\nIn reply to your letter in which the agent sent up today after having it in his office for most of a month as he told me six weeks ago when he visited the school that there was a letter there from the Department but he had forgotten to bring it up as I got my mail at Ponoka so a reply came from the Department addressed to me at Ponoka with the agent's mail and he then sends it up.\n\nI may say in regard to the agent reporting about low trying fact a large attendance but I had not received assistance from anyone in the matter is an untrue statement as I have taken an interest in the children attending school to the best of my ability.\nand can get proof of this fact.\n\nI wish also to say that after I arrived here Mr. Taylor and I drove around to the different homes who were attending school and urged them to come. They made excuses such as he's a woman now she should be home working etc.\n\nI must also state in the latter part of November or beginning of December Mr. Taylor and the agent a list of those not attending as the agent said he was going to act as a tenant officer and compel them to come. But the children failed to arrive.\n\nTwo weeks before Christmas I took a very severe attack of bronchitis but managed to teach until the holidays when I took very ill and was unable to resume my duties.\nuntil January 18th when the Indian agent visited school six days after school reopened and asked for another list of those who hadn't been at school yet as he didn't know which ones were attending or those who weren't, no doubt he found out the other this was January 26th and he had taken no steps then to have them attend but said he was going to but they failed to arrive yet.\n\nThe children have all had mumps during this quarter as Mr. McLellan reported.\n\nNow, if the agent failed to get the children to attend what effect would I have in urging them to come if he can't compel them it can't be expected of me.\n\nThose attending school attend fairly when no sickness but it is those\nwho haven't been to school yet.\n\nWe live six miles from the school at the edge of the Reserve, but at the end of the children not attending have no English nor yet have their parents for which would be useless for me to go and urge them to come without having their language nor no interpreter as Rev. C.J. Taylor is attending Edmonton University and especially since you heard my I must also say I am making investigation into this matter and shall get the agent on his next visit what this means as I am not going to withhold such.\n\nI have already sent a copy to Rev. Arthur Baines but Indian Education and if this is not investigated into I shall leave the work as I am\ndoing my very best in regards\nthis matter, and I am very much\nsurprised at such a statement.\nI quite understand why he was\nand which was no fault of mine.\nI shall write the other letters\nseparate so as they shall not\ncontain more than one subject.\nFurther you shall understand\ncircumstances, and in my investigation\nshould I deem it necessary to\nwrite again you shall always\nme in the near future.\n\nYours truly,\n[Signature]\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada\nDear Sir:\n\nI feel it my duty to report conditions at the Lamont Bay School.\n\nThe agent brought them to school and told me he didn't think I would find many biscuits as the mice had been at them.\n\nIn opening a box I found no biscuits but crumbs, mice nests and mice skeletons which is a disgrace and the box full of such above mentioned.\n\nI wish also to say that one evening the box the children held their noses and said \"yes\" to which I apologized and said the agent did not know they were in such a state to which they replied \"no\" they were destroyed by mice so that it is impossible to expect us to eat such.\n\nI am not saying he knew the state\nthe book was in, but he knew\ncertainly not had been destroyed\nby smell by the smell of the book.\nIt when he knew such was the\ncase he should be investigated.\nAnd it wasn't clearness on his part\nto expect the children to eat such\nthat had been so badly fettered\nby smell it is inevitable that it is in\na dreadful state if for example\nas requested I shall gladly send\nit along.\nI am going to show the book\nin my next report.\nSuggesting that these receive attention\nbut I heard for me to teach\nthem cleanliness when I meet\nwith such dirt.\nThanking you.\nYours Truly,\nEdna Smithson.\nOttawa, February 11, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nThe returns received from the Samson's Indian Day School show a small average attendance. The Agent states that he has been trying to get a larger attendance, but has not received much assistance from you in the matter.\n\nIt is expected that you will use every effort you can to induce the parents to send their children regularly to school. It is part of the teacher's duty to encourage the children in their attendance in every way possible. The Department will expect to see better results as regards the attendance during the balance of the school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Ida Fairservice,\nTeacher,\nSamson's Indian Day School,\nHobbema, Alta.\nExtract from report of Agent C. W. Kirby on the Samson's Indian Day School for the month of January, 1921. Original on 117199/7.\n\nI am trying to get a larger attendance, but am not receiving much assistance from Miss Fairservice.\nExtract from Agent's Report for the month of August 1920, on the Samson's Indian Day School. Original on 117199-7.\n\nA new teacher has been appointed to teach this school by the mission authorities and took charge on the 31st.\n\nJ. Butlin,\nAgent.\nOttawa, March 26, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant in reference to the amount of salary paid you as teacher of the Samson's Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the salaries paid the teachers in the Methodist Indian day schools are arranged between the Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, and the Department, and the amount allowed for the teacher of the Samson's Day School is at the rate of $600.00 per annum. You should refer to Rev. Mr. Ferrier regarding an increase in your present salary.\n\nIn reference to the bonus I beg to say that a bonus is allowed to teachers of Indian day schools at the rate of $150.00 per annum, payable quarterly, for the present fiscal year. You began duties on November 12th and the $20.60 received by you was the amount of the bonus due for the time you taught during the December quarter. As soon as your returns for the March quarter are received you will be entitled to a further instalment of the bonus of $37.50.\n\nThe cheques for salary are sent to the Treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society, Toronto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Roy O. Taylor,\nTeacher,\nSamsons Indian Day School,\nPonoka, Alta.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nTo\u2014The Sec\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nJust a line to bring reference to salary paid for teaching in an Indian Day School. This I am told is $60.00 per month. Now in view of the increasing high cost of living you will agree that this is entirely inadequate.\n\nAgain you are no doubt aware that in white schools the minimum salary is $820.00 per annum. This is paid not only to those holding a certificate but also to those teaching on permit.\n\nIn Alberta at least, the teachers are united in demanding and are getting a salary commensurate with the H.C.I. living. Now I think I will be quite in order when I say that it is true the salary was increased in Indian Schools and that the pre-war wage is not enough. This will mean less difficulty in getting suitable teachers for our Indian schools.\nYou will agree that there are not as many attractions in an Indian School as there are in a white school. In the first place you are isolated and more or less in contact with Indians only. To one who may not speak the language this is not very attractive.\n\nAgain your work is more exacting as the progress of the pupils is so slow as at times to be almost discouraging.\n\nI would like to know when and what bonus you pay for teaching. I received one cheque for $20.60. In what amount? Do you forward it on receipt?\n\nPlease take this matter up with the Dept. and advise me what is being done. I think the salaries ought to be retrospective till Oct. 1918 if any increase is considered. Thanking you for favor asked.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRoy L. Taylor.\nOttawa, December 9th, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo enclosing a communication from the Rev. Roy C. Taylor, teacher of the Samson Indian Day School, in which he applies for a grant to provide a Christmas treat for the pupils.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will authorize an expenditure to the extent of $7.00 for the purchase of fruit, candy, etc., to provide a treat for the pupils at Christmas. You will be good enough to furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of these articles, the amount of which should not exceed the above sum of $7.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Butlin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to herewith enclose a communication from the Rev. R. Taylor, teacher of the Samson Day School, in which he is asking the Department to assist in getting up an Xmas tree for the pupils.\n\nWith the exception of the last few years the Department had allowed the teacher the amount of $7.00 towards the Christmas tree.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nLansona Day School\nNov 24th 1919\n\nMr. J. Butten\nIndian Agent\nHobbema\n\nDear sir,\n\nI am writing you with reference to our intended Xmas tree for the school children. This will only be possible if the Indian Department offer some assistance. A small donation for the purchase of fruit and candy etc. would be much appreciated by both pupils and teacher alike.\n\nI would be very pleased if you would make this request to the proper authorities so that we shall know whether or not our plans for a Xmas tree are to materialize.\n\nYours very sincerely,\nRev Roy L. Taylor (Teacher)\nOttawa, October 27, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant enclosing a communication from Rev. R. J. Taylor, teacher of the Samson's Indian Day School, requesting permission to hold the classes in the Mission Church, instead of in the school-house.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, provided the church authorities have no objection to the use of the Church for school purposes, the Department will approve of the transfer of the equipment, desks, etc., at a cost not to exceed $10.00. A curtain may also be purchased for the school-room and the Church building banked for the winter, at a cost not to exceed the amount stated by you. It is noted that this school will be re-opened for class work on the first proximo.\n\nAfter the desks and equipment are removed from the old school building the windows and doors should be securely fastened up.\n\nIf any school material, such as books, stationery, etc., is required the teacher should forward a requisition for the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. G. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Butlin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbs, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to state that the Rev. R.C. Taylor has taken over the Samson Day School from the Rev. R.B. Steinhauer transferred.\n\nThe school will be re-opened for class-work on November 1, 1919.\n\nI am enclosing an application from Mr. Taylor asking for permission to hold the class in the Mission Church instead of in the old school house at Farm 15B., also to move the equipment, desks and etc to the church for a cost of $10.00. He also asks for the amount of $10.00 for a curtain for the school-room, and $5.00 to bank up the church building for the winter. Total cost $25.00 -\n\nFor the reasons stated in Mr. Taylor's letter I would recommend the above application.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nBattle River Mission\nLamoon Reserve\nOct. 20th 1919\n\nMr. J. Butten\nIndian Agent\nHobbema\n\nDear sir,\n\nI beg to make application to you for permission to hold Day School in the mission church instead of the old school. This would be more convenient for me, as it is nearer the mission house, and is also I believe, more central for the children who attend.\n\nThere would be some little expense entailed in carrying out this plan viz. moving of School\nequipment i.e. desks etc. The church building would need banking to ensure warmth. The following is an approximate estimate of moving school furniture and putting into shape at new location.\n\n(1) Moving school furniture, lavatories etc. $10.00\n(2) Banking church building $5.00\n(3) Curtain for school-room $10.00\n\nTotal $25.00\n\nThanking you in anticipation for favor asked.\n\nYours very Sincerely,\n\nRoy L.

When school commences again I will forward vouchers in favour of Mrs. Steinhauser as instructed.\n\nI am Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Asst.

Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, in which he states that Mrs. Steinhauer, wife of the teacher of the Samson Day School, goes over to the school every day and prepares a hot dinner for the children and that Mr. Steinhauer has written him, asking if any financial recognition could be given for her services.\n\nMr. Ferrier has been informed that the Department will make Mrs. Steinhauer an allowance of $10.00 a month for the ten teaching months for her services in preparing this meal for the children. This allowance will be made from the first of September, last.\n\nYou should forward vouchers in the usual way at the end of each month for the amount due Mrs. Steinhauer for this service. Kindly forward a voucher at once for the amount due her for the months of September and October.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ. Butlin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nOttawa, October 30, 1918.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant, in which you state that Mrs. Steinhauer goes every day to the Samson's Day School and prepares a hot dinner for the children and that Mr. Steinhauer, the teacher, has written you asking if any financial recognition could be given for her services, and suggest that she be given a grant of $150.00, which would be seventy-five cents a day for two hundred teaching days.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will make Mrs. Steinhauer an allowance of $10.00 a month for the ten teaching months for her services in preparing this meal for the children. This allowance will be made from the first of September, last. Mr. Agent Dublin will be advised of this grant being allowed and instructed to forward vouchers at the end of each month for the amount due Mrs. Steinhauer.\n\nIn regard to driving the children to school, I beg to say that the Department has no funds available for this purpose at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nToronto, October 24th, 1918\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nOn the Hobema Reserve Rev. R. B. Steinhauer is teacher. Mrs. Steinhauer goes over every day and prepares a hot dinner for the children. I visited there last winter and recognized the excellent service she was giving in that capacity. Mr. Steinhauer has written me asking if any financial recognition could be given for her services. I would suggest a grant of $150; this would be .75\u00a2 a day for 200 teaching days. He also informed me that the stage had been discontinued for bringing the children to the school. I think that this is a very important matter affecting materially the attendance, as many of the children are far away.\n\nYour consideration of these two requests from Mr. Steinhauer will be appreciated, for I think they are both worthy.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nTF/M\n\nP Perrier\n\nDuncan C.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant embodying an extract from a letter of Rev. W. Hollingsworth, Lacombe, Alta., through whom payment is made of the salary of the teacher of the Samson's Day School, with reference to an increase in the salary of the teacher of this school and to the amount paid by the Department for the quarter ending March 31st, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Miss Aylwin applied to the Department in March, last, for an increase in her salary from $500.00 to $600.00 per annum. Her request was granted, such increase to date from the first of January, last. It was through an oversight that the Treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society was not notified of this increase.\n\nWith reference to the amount of salary allowed Miss Aylwin for her services for the period which she taught this school during the March quarter, last, I beg to say that she closed this school during the months of January and February and only taught for a period of twenty days in March, for which salary was allowed at the rate of $600.00 per annum and a cheque for $60.00, being the amount due, was sent to the Treasurer of your church.\n\nMiss Aylwin was informed that, as she had closed\n\nRev. J. H. Armup, B.A.,\nAssistant Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nWesley Building,\n299 Queen St., West,\nToronto, Ont.\nclosed this school during the two months above stated, she must keep it open during July and August, next, and, if she does so, the full amount of her yearly salary will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nMay 21st, 1917.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following is an extract from a letter of Rev. W. Hollingsworth, of Lacombe, Alberta, through whom payment is made to the teacher of the Indian Day School on Samson's Reserve, Alberta:\n\n\"I am in receipt of a letter from Miss A. Aylwin, of the Samson's Day School, stating that she applied for an increase of salary from $500 to $600 and that the letter she received from the Department indicated that this was granted and would date from January 1st last. As I have no word from you to that effect, and the cheque for the quarter does not include such addition, I imagine that there is either a blunder in her interpretation of the Department's reply, or that from some neglect the Mission Rooms have not been advised.\"\n\nWe have received no intimation of this increase, and should be glad of an authoritative statement which we may present to Mr. Hollingsworth, and through him to the teacher. For the third quarter of the current year the cheque from the Department amounted to only $60 instead of the usual amount of $125.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJHA/M.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ. D.

I also have a horse to keep.\n\nMy father died a little over a year ago and since then two of my brothers have gone to the front, so that I have expenses to meet now that I did not have before, and that my salary will hardly allow for.\n\nI respectfully ask that my salary be raised to $200 instead of $800, which will not be a bit too much to cover\nmy expenses.\n\nHoping that you will give my letter your favorable consideration and thanking you in advance I am\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nAbbe Sylvain\nOttawa, January 18, 1917.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 10th instant I beg to say that if the Samson's Day School is closed during the months of January and February it must be kept open during July and August, as teachers of day schools are required to teach two hundred days in the year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss A. Aylwin,\nTeacher,\nSamson's Indian Day School,\nPonoka, Alta.\nJ. D. McLean Esq.,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received your letter of the 3rd regarding the Sunday Day School, giving me permission to close the school during Jan. and Feb., for which I am very thankful. I have not been teaching since the new year began, and I shall keep the school open during July and August, but beg to be allowed to put someone in my place part of the time. I do not feel that I am receiving justice to be compelled to teach all through the hot weather on account of not having a school warm enough to stay in through the winter. Also will I be permitted to open school the latter part of Feb. if the weather permits, and take that time off in the summer.\n\nHoping for an early reply and thanking you for your kind favors I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. G. Lewis (signature)\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Miss Aylwin, teacher of the Samson Day School, wrote me on the 12th inst., asking if she might close the school during the months of January and February, 1917, giving as her reason, that the school house was cold and the children poorly clad. I replied to the Teacher informing her that I could not see any necessity for the closing of the school during these months, also asked her to re-open the school on the date set for the same in January 1917.\n\nToday I received the attached communication from Miss Aylwin, stating that she would not reopen school until she had heard from the Department.\n\nI might say that the children are well clad, a good supply of clothing having been given them from the Dept. stores here, blankets have been supplied the driver who conveys them to school, for use in his sleigh. A good meal is also given the children at noon. There is plenty of wood and the fires kept up. The school house is not any different to what it was other winters. I do not therefore think it necessary to close the school, and the weather here is very mild.\n\nThe average attendance during this quarter has been II - small and irregular. This would be the only reason for the closing of the school, in my opinion.\n\nWill the Department kindly advise me.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI am Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nPovoka Alta\nDec 30, 1916\n\nInd Agent Hothema.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sending in my returns this morning.\n\nI have written to the department and told them that the school is too cold to teach in during the cold weather.\n\nI shall not open school again till I hear from them. I should hear about Tuesday.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. Aylen\nOttawa, January 3, 1917.\n\nSIR,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Miss Aylwin, teacher of the Sanson's Indian Day School, in which she asks that the school be closed during the cold weather, owing to the condition of the building.\n\nMiss Aylwin has been informed that this school may be closed during the months of January and February and kept open during July and August instead.\n\nIf you will refer to the Indian Day School Regulations, a copy of which is enclosed herewith, you will see that the summer holidays may taken at some other time of the year, if it is considered desirable to do this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Butlin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nOttawa, January 3, 1927.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo in regard to closing the Samson's Indian Day School during the cold weather.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the condition of the building, this school may be closed during the months of January and February and kept open during July and August instead. Mr. Agent Butlin will be written to in regard to the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss A. Aylwin,\nTeacher,\nSamson's Indian Day School,\nPonoka, Alta.\nSamson Bay School\nPenoka, Alta.\nDec 22nd 1916\n\nSchool Dept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wrote to the Indian Agent some time ago, telling him that I did not think it was possible for me to keep the school opened during the cold weather.\n\nThe school is very old and even if there was an effort made to fix it up I do not think it could be made warm as the wind blows though all around the walls. And in some places there are great cracks that one can see through.\n\nSome of the children are very poorly clad, wearing only summer clothing, and they have been compelled to sit around the stove for the last two weeks in order to keep warm.\n\nThe school has been condemned by several parties who have visited the school within the last two years and the rotten part looks too as if it were going to collapse.\n\nIn the Agents answer regarding my letter he stated: That he did not see any reason for closing the school through January and February.\nwhich are the months which I asked for to have it closed) and for me to kindly open the school at the proper date after the holidays. I cannot see how I can do it; it is unreasonable to ask it.\n\nLast winter we had a very cold spell in January and there was another stove put up in the school room. The bottom is burnt out of this stove and there is no lid for the top and often we could not make a fire in it because it filled the room with smoke.\n\nAnyone who has examined the school will say that it is not fit to teach in during the cold weather, but I would be sorry to quit the school up on account of this. Though my salary is smaller than that which other teachers are receiving, I am able to keep it on account of being near home and able to board there.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon and that this letter will receive your favorable consideration.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nMiss A. Sylvester\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, December 7, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant enclosing a communication from the teacher of the Samson's Bay School in which she asks the Department to grant her some assistance in getting up her usual Christmas tree for the pupils.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to make any allowance for this purpose this Christmas, as it is not considered that the attendance would justify it. You will be good enough to inform the teacher accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ.

Allymowin\nMethodist\n$500 - 1912\nformer field worker\n\nJus 32\nboys 47\n33\n80\n\nhigher enrollment 26 -\naverage 14\nsummer last quarter 17\naverage 11\nSamson's day school.\n\nAlberta Inspectorate,\nRed Deer, November 13, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant in which you ask me to state what changes are necessary to secure a regular attendance of pupils at the Samson's day school. My view is that regular attendance can only be secured through compulsion. Under the existing conditions I think the expenditure is largely a waste of funds and energy. It is necessary for White children to attend classes regularly for about 10 years to gain an ordinary education. Whites have an advantage over the Indians for the tuition is in a language, generally at least, spoken and understood from babyhood. My impression is that if the records of this school are compiled for the last 3 years that the most regular attendants were not present 1/3 of the days the school was in operation.\n\nI hesitate, however, with regard to advising coercive measures, until adequate provision has been provided to receive the children. At this point a new and up-to-date class room, with a kitchen and refectory attached, and a cottage & a stable for the use of the teacher would be required. I would ask the Indians to set aside about 160 acres of land for school purposes. My reason for suggesting such a large area of land is because at some future date it might be thought expedient.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nexpedient to provide and operate some other kind of a school than the one herein suggested. In such an event there would be sufficient land for pasture, farming and gardening and the buildings on the ground could then be used for some purpose.\n\nIf the Department has decided to continue an industrial school, at Red Deer or at some other point in Northern Alta., the children from this day school ought to be transferred to the industrial school, on attaining the age of say 14 years, for a 3 year term.\n\nThe day school should be, I think, in charge of a qualified male teacher, married and without a family. About an acre of land might be under cultivation in connection with this day school so that the teacher would be in a position to practically demonstrate the growing of flowers and garden stuff in this acre plot during the summer months.\n\nThe cost of the buildings, fences, well, &c., would be between $5000. and $5500.00. I would not expect to secure a competent teacher for this post for less than $75.00 per month and then on the assurance that this salary would be advanced to $83.33 per month after a 2 year term and there was abundant evidence of proficiency.\n\nThe curriculum of Indian schools require revision, I think. If the present generation of Indians are educated in ethics and the masses advanced to about Standard IV, i.e., speak, read, write fair English and compute ordinary business transactions, the Department would then have discharged its duty towards the Indians along educational lines.\n\nMy notion is that the young male Indians should be encouraged to take up diversified farming for a livelihood and the young females tutored along such lines as will best fit them to become helpful wives to Indian farmers. I have stated on several occasions that the class books in use in Indian schools do not, in my opinion, meet the requirements of the pupils, say for Indian children after they have\nhave passed standard 2 readers, or standard 3, anyway.\n\nThe opinion I have held is that every line of reading matter should be instructive on ethics and the gaining of an honourable livelihood in after life.\n\nRegarding the so called Industrial schools I entertain the view that of late they seem to me striving to make sufficient to meet expenses to too great a degree. When they are compelled to do this too little class & demonstration work is carried on. Last week I visited the St. Joseph's school (Dunbow) and there has been no class work by the boys since June last at this institution. Gardening, haying, harvesting and threshing has been the occupation of the staff and the male pupils for over 4 months. Class work likely was resumed by the boys today. The girls have received regular tuition, however. I shall likely make up a report of this inspection to-morrow and have simply referred to this to illustrate my statement \"that industrial schools seemed to me to be striving too much now to meet the expenses of operation\".\n\nThe vacation, too, should be at a time when it best met the local conditions.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp.\nOttawa, November 8, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to that portion of your report on the Samson's Bay School in which you state that some very radical changes seem to be necessary at this school to secure regular attendance I beg to say that the Department would like you to state what changes you think should be made other than having the school remain open during July and August and the vacation taken in November and April.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ. A. Markle, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRed Deer, Alta.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR J.A. MARKLE ON THE SAMSON'S DAY SCHOOL.\n\nDATE OF INSPECTION, - OCTOBER 24th, 1916\n\nNUMBER OF PUPILS PRESENT - .......... 14\nNumber of children that should attend ....... 45\nNumber of children enrolled, - ........ 32.\n\n12 enrolled are reported 5 years.\n8 enrolled are reported 6 years.\n\nLack of interest by both the parents and the children.\n\nThe months of July and August usually taken for vacation,\nIndians are usually at home these months and absent November\nand April, depends some on the season. Vacation could be\ngiven these months to better advantage to the school.\n\nIf the quarterly returns are examined they will\nshow plainly why so little progress made at this institution,\ni.e., irregular attendance by pupils trying to master a strange\nlanguage.\n\nSome very radical changes seem to be necessary at this\nschool to secure regular attendance. Without this very little\nprogress can be made. The harvest is some later than usual this\nseason and the threshing is still to be done. As soon as the\nIndians can get away at rat hunting they are likely to go and\nto take the children with them. The attendance will suffer in\nconsequence of children leaving on the rat hunt. Think school\nshould remain open during July and August and vacation given\nwhen Indians and children away - likely about months of November\nand April. School in operation 5 days during September, also\nclosed all of July and August.\n\nDate of Inspection, - October 24th, 1916.\nOttawa, September 18, 1916.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant in regard to the Sampson's Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you should endeavour to secure another driver at once. You should also inform the Indians that they must send their children to this school regularly, and if necessary, you should enforce the regulations relating to the education of Indian children.\n\nThe Department expects you to take a decided stand in this matter, and it is hoped that the Indians will see the necessity of sending their children to the school regularly.\n\nYou will be good enough to report in the near future as to what action you have taken.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nJ. Butlin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nHobbema, Alta.\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that Samson's Day School was re-opened on September 1st, with a man to drive the children to and from the school, also a good supply of material on hand for a mid-day meal for the pupils. On the 8th the driver gave up his work, and since then I have not been able to secure another driver.\n\nI visited the school today, Miss Aylwin, Teacher present but no children. I have spoken to Chief Samson and others, but they appear indifferent as to assisting in keeping up attendance at school.\n\nDuring the latter part of last term the attendance was small and irregular.\n\nI instructed the Teacher to close the school again, and await your instructions in the matter.\n\nKindly advise me.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI went to the Hobbema Agency at noon today and with a view of inspecting the Day School on the Samson's Reserve and before it closed for the summer holidays. On arrival at the Agency I learned that Mrs. Mann had died a few hours previously and as work had been upset through this sad occurrence I returned home with the intention of making this inspection at some future date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWith reference to your letter No. II7199/I of November 15, 1914, and to the appointment of Miss Gertrude Aylwin as assistant at Samsen's Day School at a salary of $25.00 per month, on condition that she act as Field Matron on the reserve, I beg to herewith enclose Miss Aylwin's reply to the same, in which she states that her sister Miss Gertrude has declined to accept the position as she does not care to perform the Field Matron duties.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPovoka Alta\nDec 15 1914\n\nJ Butten Esq:\nIndian Agent,\n473240\nSuffern Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMiss A.

A copy of the Memorandum of Instructions for Field Matrons on Indian Reserves is enclosed herewith for her guidance and she will be required to furnish a report at the end of each month as called for in the last paragraph of these instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Butlin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Agent Butlin encloses an application from Miss Abbie Aylwin, teacher of the Samson's Day School, for an assistant. The Agent says that she can get her sister to help her for $25.00 a month.\n\nThis school is apparently making good progress under Miss Aylwin's charge, as shown by the Agent's report for the month of October, last. Her predecessor, Mrs. Watters, had an assistant allowed her. As the preparation of the mid-day meal and the teaching of domestic science takes her attention from the school work, I think the Department would be justified in allowing her an assistant so long as the attendance keeps up. Having her sister with her I think would insure better work.\n\nOK OK\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nHobbema, Alberta.\n\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to herewith attach an application received from Miss Abbie Aylwin, teacher of Samson's Day School, in which she is asking the Department to grant her an assistant, and gives her reasons.\n\nMiss Aylwin states that her sister Miss Gertrude Aylwin would act as her assistant for $25.00 per month.\n\nI might state that the attendance at this school for the present year shows as follows:\n\nQuarter ended March 31, 1914 average attendance = 10 - 52\n\" \" 30th June \" \" \" = 8 - 63\n\" \" 30th Sept. \" \" \" = 12 - 14\nMonth ended October 31, \" \" \" = 17 -\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPonoka Alta\nSep 30, 1914\n\nJ. Butlin Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema Alt.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn regard to the matter we were speaking of a few days ago; I think I would be able to get an assistant at \u00a325 a month.\n\nThere could be a great deal more done for the children in the way of keeping them clean if I had an assistant, as well as teaching them to sew and cook, as my time is divided between the two rooms the school work is neglected.\nwhile I am attending to sewing and cooking and such work.\n\nI would be very much pleased if you would take this matter up with the Department and point out to them the difficulties which we are working under, and how unsatisfactory it is for one person to be trying to manage so much work. Besides I think we would have a better attendance as a number of the big girls would take an interest if they could spend more time at sewing and cooking. They might also be taught to prepare vegetables for the mid day meal.\nHoping that my letter will meet your favorable consideration\n\nI am\n\nyour truly,\n\nA. Aylenin\n\n(teacher)\nOttawa, June 14, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, and in reply I beg to say that, in view of the circumstances, six weeks holidays may be allowed the children of the Samson's day school and also the additional two weeks may be taken at the Christmas season, as suggested by the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeo. G. Manp, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI beg to herewith enclose a letter received from Miss Aylwin, Teacher of Samson's Day School, relative to the summer holidays.\n\nMiss Aylwin is asking to be allowed to take only six weeks holidays during the summer, instead of the two months as granted by the Department, and the remainder of the holidays she would like to have at Christmas time.\n\nKindly advise me if this arrangement would be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nI am Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nGeo. Y. Mann Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn regard to the holidays I would like to have it arranged so that we would have but six weeks during the summer, and the remainder of the time to be taken at Xmas.\n\nAbout the middle of August the Indians will be here looking after their hay, and we will have a better attendance than we would during the cold, short days of the winter.\n\nHoping that this will meet with the department's approval I am.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAbbie Aylwin\nTeacher\nOttawa, May 7, 1912.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that it was not the intention of the Department to ask you to do systematic field matron work on the Samson's Reserve in addition to your duties as teacher of the day school. However, your duty as teacher will call for your visiting the homes of the pupils, as it is only in this way that you can obtain and retain the confidence of the parents and incidentally in these visits it will be possible for you to do some work along these lines.\n\nI may say that the Department desires you to give instruction in sewing to the girls attending the school and I would ask you to report what materials will be necessary for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Abbie Aylwin,\nTeacher,\nSamson's Indian Day School,\nPonoka, Alta.\nPonoka Alta\nApril 24, 1912\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy, etc.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your favor of the 5th inst. and in reply beg to say that there has been some mistake in regard to the Field Matron Work. I did not apply for the Field Matron position as it has not been held by the teacher heretofore.\n\nThe school hours being from nine A.M. till four P.M. it would be impossible for me to do the work during those hours. In any case it would be necessary for me to keep a horse which would be considerable expense to me.\n\nI might say that if the department saw fit to make my salary eight hundred dollars a year, I would keep a horse and attend to this work after four and on Saturdays when necessary.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAlgie Aylen\nReferring to your letter of\n\nNo.\n\nI beg to herewith enclose the report of Mrs. Watters in connection with the field Matron work on Samson's Reserve, for the month of March 1912. The same is not made out in accordance with the Departments' instructions letter No. II7199/I dated March 7, last.\n\nThese instructions were received at this Agency on the 14th March, and forwarded the same day to Mrs. Watters. I herewith attach Mrs Watters reply to the same on the 20th in which she states that the instructions are too late to be followed for the month of March.\n\nFrom what I can learn, apparently, the visits recorded in this report, are visits made by Indians to Mrs. Watters residence.\n\nMrs. Watters and family left Hobbema on the 30th March, for Edmonton.\n\nMiss Alwin is in charge of the class-room work and the work of preparing the Noon-day meal for the pupils.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nHobbema,\nMar 20/1912\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour instructions received.\n\nIt will be too late for this month to make out dated report.

Monthly reports on the field matron work will be expected regularly and the Agent will report upon the class-room work.

S. G. I. A.\nReserve Hall\nPonoka Alta\n20 Mar/12\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to yours of March 10th which I have just received would say forget that my letter seemed conditional. I cannot possibly continue longer than end of March & herewith resign my position.\n\nIt was only my intention to recommend the party mentioned as I find it impossible for me to manage successfully all the branches of the work. I knew it was Miss Perry's intention to assist with the midday meal & with the girls. I felt that the work could not be left in\nbetter hands\n\nRegretting the delay caused by my mistake\n\nI am yours respectfully,\n\nFlorence Watters\nOttawa, March 26, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nReplying to your inquiry of yesterday's date I beg to say that at the end of the June quarter, 1910, Mrs. Watters, who formerly taught the Goodfish Lake Day School, was transferred to Samson's Day School, Hobbema Reserve, as teacher and field matron at a salary of $500.00 per annum. In August of 1911 an assistant at a salary of $300.00 per annum was appointed. On March 4th, last, Mrs. Watters sent in her resignation, which was conditional upon Mr. A. Perry being appointed her successor as teacher of the school and on the 11th instant a reply was sent stating that her resignation with the condition attached could not be accepted, but that, if it was absolutely impossible for her to continue in the work on account of the state of her health, she should send in a definite resignation. On March 12th the Agent wrote enclosing an application from Miss Aylwin, who has been Mrs. Watters' assistant since the beginning of this calendar year, and the Department informed\ninformed the Agent that should an unconditional resignation be received from Mrs. Watters Miss Aylwin's application would be borne in mind and that on account of her experience the Department was prepared to look favourably upon her application. By Saturday's mail a letter came from Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, enclosing Mrs. Watters' resignation and an application from Mr. Perry for the position of teacher for himself and for Mrs. Perry as field matron. No action has yet been taken on Mr. Ferrier's letter, nor on Miss Aylwin's application since the receipt of the resignation.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nMEMORANDUM\n\nSchools Branch -\n\nWill you please let me have a memorandum with reference to Mrs. Waterson, teacher of the Indian school, Hobbema Reserve.

A.\nSecretary Department Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed you will find the resignation of Mrs. Matters as Teacher of the School on the Samson Reserve, Alberta. Also an application from Mr. A.J. Perry. I have also a letter from the Rev. Mr. Barner, Principal of the Red Deer Institute, recommending the appointment of Mr. Perry as Teacher, inasmuch as he appears to have his heart in the work and would have the help of his wife in preparing a warm meal for the children. I think this appointment would be very satisfactory. I would like the sanction of the Department to it, and also let me know what salary the Department would be willing to pay. Mr. Scott has been on this Reserve personally and knows the conditions. An answer at your earliest convenience will greatly oblige me. In the meantime I will write Mr. Perry telling him the steps I have taken re the application.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nF. Ferrier\nDear Sir,\n\nAs Mrs. Waters has informed me that owing to ill-health she has decided to resign the school on the Samson Reserve, and as I presume that my chance for the other position, for which I applied to you, are very slight, I would be glad if you would consider any application for the school.\n\nI could be ready to take charge by April 1st. Mrs. Perry would assist me by preparing the dinner for the pupils, and as we have no family, and consequently her household duties are light, she thinks that she could take charge of the field workers' duties also.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA. M. Perry\n\nP.S. If you consider my application favourably, kindly let me know as soon as possible, in order that I can make preparations for moving.\nIndian Industrial School\n\nat Red Deer Alta\n\n4th May 1912\n\nMEMO.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI understand that my sister is resigning her work at Hobema owing to ill health. I know it has been a great strain on her with her nervous condition, and I think she is very wise in her action. The Government and Church have got better returns for their expenditure there under her regime than I have seen in 9 years of observation of that work.\n\nI am glad to say that an excellent supply for the work is appearing in the person of Mr. H.W. Perry. He and his wife are willing, I believe, to take charge. I am sure you will make no mistake in engaging him if his\nIndian Industrial School\n\nMEMO.\n\nname comes before you because he has a love for the Indians and has been successful as a farm instructor among them. Trusting that all are well,\n\nYours fraternal,\n\nArthur Barner\nReserve Hall\nPonoka Alta\nMar. 4/12\n\nDear Sir Terrie,\n\nMy health has been very poor for some time & my doctor claims I cannot recover without complete rest, so I find it necessary to resign my position as teacher of Sampson's school - Hobbema.\n\nI have been loathe to give up, fearing the work might return to state of neglect; but the way seems to be opening nicely.\nI have been talking the matter over with Mr. Perry. Mr. and Mrs. Perry are quite interested in the work. I feel confident if Mr. Perry's application for the position is accepted that the work will not suffer in the least through change of teachers.\n\nMr. Perry's application will soon be in for the school.\n\nOf course, I may resign in his favour and will leave feeling that the work will be kept up in good shape. I have worked hard since coming here to build up the work, and I would not like to see it neglected again. I wish to resign at the end of March which is the end of the present quarter. The work here is in good condition.\ninterest in school continues. I am sorry to be obliged to resign but I find I cannot recover or remain in the work.\n\nSincere regards\nto Mrs Ferrier & family\n\nYrs sincerely\n\nMrs Florence Walters\nOttawa, March 21, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant enclosing an application from Miss Aylwin for the position of teacher and matron on the Samson's Reserve in the event of Mrs. Watters resigning.\n\nIn reply I may say that the Department has not received an unconditional resignation from Mrs. Watters, but, should such be received, Miss Aylwin's application will be kept in mind. On account of Miss Aylwin's experience the Department is prepared to look favourably upon her application.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeo. G.

Miss Aylwin wishes to keep her position and in addition to it to do the work that Mrs. Watters has been doing, preparing the mid-day meal for the pupils.\n\nMiss Aylwin informs me that she has had two years training in the Alberta College in Edmonton, and so far I have found her work in connection with the Day School satisfactory. In event of Mrs. Watters leaving I would suggest that Miss Aylwin's application receive consideration.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPonoka, Alta\nMarch 12, 1912\n\nG.

Jan 3/12\n\nI have not been able to do as much in connection with\nthis work as I had hoped during past month. Partly\nowing to illness, & not having any team to drive\naround with makes it difficult to handle the visiting\nduring winter months. I find that the women have\na good knowledge of washing & cleaning & instruction\nalong this line is not necessary. I find many of\nthe homes as neatly kept as can be expected in\ntheir circumstances; all that is needed is occasional\nvisiting & encouragement. The women are coming to\nme with their various needs & help them with sewing\netc in my home. In cases of sickness, I take food\nor whatever is needed. I have helped women make\nquilts. Have given out seventeen quilts to families\nwho needed them. Visited with 17 families &\nhelped in making garments. Given clothing\nto ten families also scripture pictures & mottoes\nfor a ornament of homes.\n\nHoping above is satisfactory, you respectfully,\n\nFlora Watts\nField Station\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter No. II7199/I of the 10th instant, and to the position of field matron in connection with the Samson Day School.\n\nI beg to inform you that Miss Abbie Aywin commenced teaching the classes on the 3rd instant, which work was handed over to her by Mrs. Watters, and the preparing of the mid-day meal is done by a little girl sent down to the school by Mrs. Watters.\n\nAs advised by you I gave Miss Aywin all the instructions for the field matron, but she informed me that she did not have anything to do with it, that Mrs. Watters had arranged with her to do the class-room work only. Miss Aywin has no qualification in the way of certificates, but appears to be making a little progress with the classes.\n\nMrs. Watters has been absent from the reserve again for the past two weeks and only returned last evening; hence I was unable to see her until today. Mrs. Watters stated that she had arranged with the Department to do the work of field matron herself, in lieu of being supplied with a class room teacher, and that the arrangement had been accepted by the Department.\n\nMrs. Watters was at the school on the 3rd inst., and not again until today.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 10, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo in which you state that Miss Abbie Aylwin has applied for the position of field matron on the Samson's Reserve and that she is recommended by Mrs. Watters.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department would like to have some information in regard to Miss Aylwin's qualifications for the position. If she has commenced work it will be necessary for her to submit monthly reports through your office, as was done by Miss Barner. As you are now familiar with the duties of a field matron you will be good enough to give Miss Aylwin such instructions as you consider necessary and also give her all the assistance in your power to make the service a success.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeo.

Since that date until yesterday the 15th Miss Barner has been keeping the school open, but closed it yesterday until after the Christmas holidays, she informed me that she was unable to continue with the school work.\n\nI cannot therefore consult with Mrs. Watters as to a successor to Miss Barner, on account of her absence, and Miss Barner could not give me the information that the Department requires.\n\nI will endeavour to see Mrs. Watters immediately upon her return here, and report to the Department.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 5, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nMrs. Watters, teacher of the Sampson's Day School, has written advising the Department that Miss Barner, her assistant, will have to give up the work at the end of the current month. She asks that a successor be appointed. The Department is prepared to carry out the suggestion and will pay at the rate of $30.00 per month for the ten school months. I have to ask you to be good enough to consult at once with Mrs. Watters and submit the name of a suitable person, giving qualifications, etc. Kindly give this matter immediate attention so that there may be someone to take up the work upon the re-opening of the school after the Christmas holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeo.

You should communicate with him.\n\nA salary of $30.00 a month for the ten school months will be allowed.

Of late I have found the work very trying. My health has been gradually giving way until a week ago when I took suddenly ill. My sister Miss Barner has kept school open & finds the work altogether too much for one person. There are 3 stoves to keep going. Dinner to prepare for 20 to 22 children; beside all the sewing & knitting, studies etc. Being anxious to build up the work here I have worked possibly harder than I thought. I would be sorry to be obliged to give up when all is progressing so nicely; but it will be quite necessary for me to resign unless I may have an assistant. Miss Barner will not be able to remain later than the end of Dec. She would be willing to assist until then; if the Deptt will give me permission to engage a suitable person to assist, duties to commence\nJan 1st. Salary $30 per month. I will endeavour to find a capable assistant until then be able to continue in charge. I will undertake to do whatever visiting is necessary among the people. Assisting where necessary in sickness, with sewing or supplying clothing to needy. The close confinement in school & the heavy responsibility is what is so hard on me. This would be remedied by having the assistant for after the heavy morning work is over I could leave her in charge & drive out on my visiting rounds. This would incur no extra expense & both branches of the work would be well cared for.\n\nHoping this plan will meet with your approval & that you will kindly let me know soon if I may do as proposed.\n\nI am yr resp.\n\nFlorence Watters\nTeacher\nSampson's school\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to herewith enclose Miss Agnes Barner's report for the month of October 1911.\n\nI am Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\"October Report.\" Ponoka P.A.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFor receiving my instructions until the latter part of Oct., no special report of the work was made out; although quite a number of visits were made up to the present the instructions given have consisted chiefly in sewing & knitting, the mother's meeting have also been fairly successful.\n\nIn May the Dept. furnished 137 yds. 8 print & flannelette remnants & up to the present the number of garments made are as follows:\n\n| Garment       | Number |\n|---------------|--------|\n| Women's skirts | 6      |\n| Women's waists | 5      |\n| Girls dresses  | 4      |\n| Children's dresses | 7    |\n| Girls skirt    | 1      |\n| Shirts         | 4      |\n\nAprons - 5\n\nBackings for quilts - 6 consisting of 130 yds.\n\nTotal number of yds. used 120, the balance of goods will be used as needed in my visits.\n\nAgnes Barner\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. II7199/5 of October 20th last, containing instructions for Miss Barner of Samson's Day School.\n\nThe delay in replying to your communication is due to Miss Barner being absent in Wetaskiwin.\n\nI have given Miss Agnes Barner a copy of your instructions which she is to follow as field matron.

Payment will be made from the time that she assumed her duties as your assistant, but the Department cannot make a cheque in her favour until such time as it is made aware of her christian name. The Agent has been asked to give this information.

No action should be taken of course to sink a well.\n\nThe Department will, however, retain the services of Miss Barner as field matron. Miss Barner will be expected to devote her efforts to the improvement of the home life of the Indians on the reserve. She should visit their homes, giving practical instruction in plain cooking, washing, sewing, the cutting, mending and making over of garments, ventilation, cleanliness, home treatment of common diseases and rules for the treatment of emergency cases as well as other branches of knowledge essential to the proper management of the home, special attention being paid to sanitation and cleanliness.

The Department will, however, be responsible for any food supplies which should be granted to sick or indigent Indians with whom you may come in contact in your field matron work. These, however, must be issued in the ordinary way from the ration house by the Agent.\n\nOwing to the fact that the contractor refuses to accept the figure first quoted by him for the new day school building the Department has been unable to finally award the contract.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Living is very high out here, each time we go for provisions a team costs us $5.00. We are obliged to buy fuel & often pay for water & have many calls for meals & food for the sick & as we will be doing considerable deaconess work the demand will be heavier. My salary barely covers expenses now, but if we were allowed rations all these demands could be much easier met.\n\nDo you think this matter could be arranged for us? We reopen school first Mon in Sep. also inspect the workmen same day; but as Miss Barner has accepted the position we will not need to close school while catering for workmen. Hoping this is satisfactory.\n\nYours respectfully,\nFlorence Walters\nOttawa August 31, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant and in reply beg to say that Mrs Watters was instructed on the 23rd instant to re-open the Samson Indian day school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAsst.

When, however, it is under construction you may close school temporarily while you are engaged in catering for the workmen.\n\nWith regard to the employment of your sister, Miss Barner, as assistant I beg to say that the Department will not be prepared to pay her a higher salary than $300.00 per annum, as this is the rate the Department has to pay for similar services.

I do not know at yet what arrangements are being made about new building; but as I will be obliged to board the carpenters while working, I thought if we were likely to have the new school by Sept it would be better not to reopen in old building, as attendance is always small until after having; & it would be hard to manage the boarding & school together so far apart. The contractor said he would put on enough men to build the school in about a week, & I would need a little time for fixing bedroom, painting floors etc. My sister Miss Banner is with me at present & would like to know if she may expect the position of assistant; as she has had another offer. I would much prefer\nmy sister to a stranger\n\nI am to be depended on\n\nhas had quite a wide experience.\n\nI have been obliged to give up my meetings during vacation.\n\nI was advised to take complete rest.\n\nThe work will soon be taken up again; after praying is over.\n\nI got so wet the two last weeks of school that I have been quite bad with rheumatism & haven't been able to walk any distance all vacation. So if we could reopen in new building it would be much easier or if my sisters engagement commenced with beginning of term we could manage nicely until later on. I hope arrangements will soon be made for water, we have none that is fit to use & are just having to depend on rain.\n\nWill you kindly let me know soon what your wish is in these matters yes resp.\n\nFlorence Walters\nExtract from letter from Mr. Agent Mann, dated July 24, 1911.

I beg to submit the following report.\n\nI visited this school today and found fourteen children present, the pupils were neat and clean, nearly all girls, and at the time of my visit were engaged in sewing.\n\nMiss Brant who has been in charge of the school work during October, November and December left the work last week, and Mrs Watters is now teaching herself. During the extremely cold weather the Teacher found the school-room cold and moved the school material up to her residence, where she is now teaching. When the weather moderates she intends to move back to the school house.\n\nThe Indian driver John Baptiste who has been employed in conveying the children to and from the school has I believe performed his duties faithfully, on those days when the weather was severe he didn't arrive with the children until nearly ten o'clock. It is my impression that if the children were not conveyed to the school the attendance would be exceedingly small.\n\nThe substantial noon-day meal supplied by the Department, has also proved a great inducement to the children.\n\nAn\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAn improvement has been noticed in the class-room work and also in the industries taught the children.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nRules for\nGerald's report\nSee under\nI requested Mr. Mann to provide a workbench for the Sampson's day school. This will be attended to as soon as the severe weather is over. I acknowledged the $30 cheque received for my sewing machine. The machine is now in use & doing good service. The girls are learning to use it.\n\nWe have been obliged to remove from the school to the school residence; until severe weather is over. The school buildings are so cold that the fires take little effect & it is impossible to even thaw out the dinner by noon. Any water spilled on floors or tables never thawed & the children cried & shivered with the cold while attendance was down at low as 5 - some days none. So rather than close school I had whatever was necessary removed to the house & we are quite comfortable our attendance since has not been less than 12. We will return to school as soon as the severe weather is over; as the buildings are very comfortable in warm weather.\n\nResp. Mrs Florence Watters\nOttawa, January 12, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to submit at once a full report upon the Samson's day school in which you should deal fully with the work being performed by the teacher and also upon the system of having the children conveyed to and from school, which has been in force for sometime.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Mrs. Waters formerly received a salary of $300.00. The Department is now paying her at the rate of $500.00 per annum.

Should this arrangement meet with Mrs. Water's approval be good enough to advise the Department so that full instructions can be given her. It is understood that for this salary Mrs. Waters will prepare a mid-day meal for the children at the school; teach them sewing knitting, etc., and endeavour to increase the attendance by obtaining an influence over the parents on the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

The school is at present in charge of Mrs. E. B. Steinhauer, wife of the Missionary on the reserve.\n\nIn this connection I beg to advise you that arrangements were lately made to convey the children from the northern portion of the reserve to the school and to provide a mid-day meal for them. New and better seating accommodation is also to be placed in the building. The Department trusts, therefore, that your society will be successful in obtaining the services of a competent teacher, as it is desired to give the day school under these conditions a fair trial. To one with proper qualifications a salary of $400.00 will be paid, but the Department would like to obtain a teacher with training as a nurse for this work, who, in addition to her school-room duties, would take up field matron work on the reserve. If possible to secure such a salary of $500.00 would be paid.

You will be good enough to advise the Department when the engagement takes effect and payment will be made monthly upon receipt of the usual vouchers. This agreement may be terminated at a month's notice from either party. The Department is very anxious that this experiment should prove a success and will rely upon you to use your best efforts to see that the desired result is accomplished.\n\nAny additional supplies required for the mid-day meal may be provided.\n\nYour remarks with reference to the desks have been noted and new ones will be provided.

The desks are old and homemade. I think there should be proper desks supplied.\n\nThe school-house is a log building 20 x 30, and was put up some years ago; it is not worth enlarging or repairing.

I beg to inform you that, the assistance asked for by the Teacher has been rendered, and the instruction contained in your letter are carefully noted.\n\nWith reference to conveying the children to and from the School, I have made inquiries and find that an Indian would transport the children from the northern portion of Samson's Reserve to the school and return them home again for the sum of $1.50 per day.\n\nThe distance from Louis Bull's Reserve to the Samson Day School is over ten miles and it would not be possible for the same team to do it all. But I will inquire and find out what one of the Louis Bull Indians will transport the children from that Reserve for.\n\nAt the present time there is a good attendance at the Samson Day School.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 2nd, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo, advising the Department that the Samson's day school has been reopened under the charge of Miss S. J. Porter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that authority to furnish provisions for a mid-day meal and to purchase fuel has already been given you.\n\nThe Department would like to see a determined effort put forth to make this a successful school. The giving of the meal referred to will probably prove an incentive to regular attendance, but more than this is required. The Department will expect you and the other officials on the reserve to use your best endeavours to secure the interest of the Indian parents and prevail upon them to send their children to school. Everything should not be left to the teacher; all should co-operate to obtain appreciable results. The Department has of late been paying particular attention to school work and where the Agent and Agency employees have a right conception of their duties and responsibilities to the Indians as well as to the Department permanent success has been met with.\n\nOn some of the reserves in Saskatchewan the experiment of conveying the children resident at a distance from school has been tried and has proved popular with the Indians. The Department would like you to make inquiries\n\nGeo. G. Mann, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHobbema, Alta.\nwith a view to ascertaining the cost of transporting the children on the northern portion of the Samson's reserve to the school, which is situated at the south side. You may also get an estimate of the cost of bringing the children from Louis Bull's to the present school. It is possible that one rig could convey from Louis Bull's and Samson's all that would attend, provided the distance is not too great. You will be good enough to go fully into this whole matter and report in detail.\n\nThe Department is anxious to provide for the education of these children on the reserve. It may require much perseverance to overcome the objection of some of the Indians to a day school, but so satisfactory has been the experience of the Department with day schools at several points in the West, it is convinced this opposition would cease could it be shown that a successful day school can be conducted. In the present instance if the results prove encouraging the Department will be prepared to establish, at a more central point on the reserve, a day school that will be a credit to it and the Indians.\n\nKindly give this matter your most earnest attention and report as soon as convenient.\n\nReferring again to the mid-day meal you will be good enough to see that Miss Porter is properly equipped to serve it, and, in case anything was overlooked in the Department's letter, that it is supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nINFORMATION AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nHobbema, Alta.\n\nJanuary 20th, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No. 1\n\nI beg to advise you that a new teacher, Miss S.J. Porter, has been supplied the Samson Day School by the Methodist Mission authorities.\n\nMiss Porter entered upon her duties there this month. I have received the enclosed requisition from her, and forward the same to you for consideration.\n\nApparently the teacher intends to live in the school house, and also wishes to give the pupils a lunch at noon, which accounts for her asking for certain articles in the requisition.\n\nA supply of ten cords of wood @ $2.50 per cord, is also required at this school. Will you kindly authorize me to purchase the same.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa Dec. 2nd, 1909\n\nMemorandum for Mr. Scott\n\nThe situation of the present school is suitable for that Band and a portion of the Montana Band, the difficulty however is to secure regular attendance with the opposition of Chief Samson to a day school.\n\nSeveral of the Indian houses are a short distance from the present site and more will probably be built owing to the removal of those who were on the surrendered portion.\n\nDuring the summer a considerable number including Samson himself camped within a half a mile of the present school, so that there is not distance that affects the attendance.\n\nA day school with boarding annex so that the scholars could be brought and returned home is I think the best solution of the attendance problem. If properly explained to Samson and built near his house he might be satisfied.\n\nIt would also be suitable for Louis Bull's people who now have no school, and would be midway between Louis Bull's and the most distant of Samsons.\nGood water would be a consideration and a deep well would have to be drilled. The plans are attached showing the approximate position of the houses on each reserve.\n\nLouis Bull is 6 miles from Sauernes House and the most distant of Sauernes people are about the same.\nOttawa, November 6, 1909.\n\nMemo.\n\nMr. J.K. McLean, D.L.S.\n\nThe question of educational facilities for the Protestant Indians on Samson's reserve has been receiving the consideration of the Department.\n\nAs you spent some time on this reserve during the past season I should be glad to have a report on the situation as seen by you while there.\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 12th instant No. 117199 re a Day School at Samson's Reserve, Alberta, I beg to say that the experiment of a Day School has been tried on this Reserve and under some of the most faithful and devoted teachers that we have ever employed, but with very poor success.\n\nMy own conviction is that nothing will satisfy Samson but a Boarding School, and this, I think, as was been pointed out in previous correspondence, would be very undesirable as long as the Red Deer School is open. I do not know if it is Indian Agent Mann's intention that Mr. Steinhauer should teach the school, but if so, I beg to say that he has abundant work in the discharge of his duties as missionary without undertaking the additional part of school teaching. If the experiment of a Day School is to be tried with any chance of success then it is essential that the Department undertake forthwith to provide the necessary appliances and make such provision for bringing the more distant children and furnishing them with a warm meal at noon as will help to overcome the reluctance of the Chief and their parents to have them attend anything but a Boarding School.\n\nIf the Department takes up heartily the most approved methods we will do all in our power to co-operate, first in the way of influencing the parents through the labors of the missionary, and secondly by trying to find and submit to the Government the names of well qualified teachers; but if this last effort is to be\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs.\n\na success, increased salaries are indispensable. I am quite of your opinion that the ordinary type of Day School has no chance of success at Samson's Reserve. I greatly sympathize with the Department in the many difficulties encountered in this matter of Indian Education, nevertheless I am persuaded that with patience and the right appliances many of these can be overcome.\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. [Signature]\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, Aug. 12th., 1906.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 16th and previous correspondence on the subject of a day school on Samson's Reserve, I have to inform you that Indian Agent Mann has stated to the Department that the Rev. E. B. Steinhauser has been instructed to open a day school on the Reserve. While the Department desires to encourage the establishment of day schools, it would seem almost hopeless to expect any degree of success on this Reserve unless some specially attractive features are to be introduced, whereby the Indian children might be led to attend regularly and in fair number. Agent Mann reports that there are about 40 children, all of Methodist parentage, on the Reserve, and therefore so far as numbers are concerned and the unity which should arise from similarity of religious belief, the ground for the establishment of a day school should be fruitful. The Department will be willing to supply funds to carry on a day school and erect any necessary additional buildings if some plan to attract a regular attendance could be devised, and if a proper teacher and competent assistance could be obtained. Chief Samson's objection to a day school might be overcome if the children who live at some distance from the school could be brought to it daily, if a warm mid-day meal was supplied or if a boarding annex, such as has been suggested, were provided. I should be glad if you would give these matters your careful consideration, as it seems almost useless to open the doors of what would be an ordinary type of day school when there is such opposition to the effort on the Reserve.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nOntario Methodist Missionary Society,\nToronto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of No. 1\n\nI beg to advise you that, the Rev. E.B. Steinhauer of the Methodist Mission here has just informed me that he has been instructed by his Superintendent Rev. T. Ferrier, to open the Day School on the Samson Reserve. That Mrs. Steinhauer was going to teach for a while or until a teacher would be supplied by the church authorities, and that they would expect the Department grant as usual.\n\nFor the information of the Department I beg to report as follows:\n\nOn the Samson Reserve there are about forty (40) children of the Methodist faith of school age 6 - 15.\n\nThe Day school was in charge of a very competent teacher at the time it was closed in June 1907, and was closed for the reason of the irregular and poor attendance.\n\nThe School shows a list of twenty-four names of children who had attended at one time or another, and the average attendance at the Day School during the last two years of its existence is as follows;\n\nJune\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJune Qr. 1906 average attendance - 5\nSept. - 8\nDec. - 3\nMarch Qr. 1906 - 4\nJune - 4\nSept. - 8\nDec. - 4\nMarch Qr. 1907 - 2\nJune - 2\n\nI might also state that Mr. Steinhauer said that Chief Simon refused to give him any assistance in getting the children to attend school. He refused to aid it in this way when the school was open.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nDictated - Dr. S. Toronto, May 14th, 1909.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, #117199, referring to the question of a Boarding School on Samson's Reserve in the Province of Alberta. I quite recognize the fact that there are serious difficulties surrounding this educational problem, and that while the Red Deer Institute remains in operation a Boarding School on Samson's Reserve would be unwise.\n\nYour question as to whether Chief Samson would be interested in the establishment of a Day School which might have a Boarding Annex is worthy of consideration. At the present time we are gathering what information we can bearing upon the whole question and I trust we may be able to suggest something to the Department at no distant date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 10th, 1899.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo requesting an explicit statement of the policy of the Department respecting the Boarding School on Samson's Reserve. In reply I beg to state that so long as the Red Deer Institution is in operation, with a staff which is large in proportion to the pupilage, and equipment which meets all the requirements, it would seem unnecessary to provide a Boarding School on Samson's Reserve. The Department recognizes the difficulties which surround the educational problem on this Reserve, but it would be impossible to give a pledge for the erection of a Boarding School on the Reserve. Would Chief Samson be interested in the establishment of a Day School, which might have a boarding annex. This plan has been carried out at White Bear's Reserve and at Mistawasis Reserve with excellent results. The Department would hope to be able to assist in establishing such a School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nSecretary, Methodist Missionary Society,\nTORONTO.\nMy dear Mr. Scott,\n\nThere are some matters in connection with Indian Educational Work in Alberta which I deem it necessary to bring before the Department, and being under the impression that it is a subject with which you now have to deal I am writing to you. If in this I am mistaken, I will trespass upon your kindness to pass over the letter to the proper official.\n\nA short time ago I received a letter from Rev. A. Barner, Principal of the Red Deer Industrial Institute, in which he gave me an account of a house to house visitation among the Protestant families on the Battle River Mission in the Hobbema Agency, in the interests of the Institute. The following is an extract from the letter referred to:\n\n\"The Rev. E. R. Steinhauer and I completed this visitation last Monday, the 15th instant. Chief Samson's home was our first call. We presented the situation to him very carefully, describing the present life and work of the School. He gave a very calm and thoughtful reply. He was very kindly in his disposition to us and very respectful, but he said 'I have never been in favor of the Red Deer School. I opposed the erection of it. I have always wanted a boarding school like the Roman Catholics have. I cannot support the Red Deer School in any way. I have asked my people to not place their children in the Roman Catholic School until next fall, so that we may know what the Government and Church are going to do for us. If a Boarding School is not assured by that time I will tell the people to send them if they like. We do not want a Day School, for we need somewhere to leave our children when we go away.'\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.\nbut we are not going to send them off the Reserve when there is a school on the Reserve.\n\n\"This is the substance of his address as it was interpreted to me by Mr. Steinhauer.\"\n\nReferring to Chief Samson's contention I think we should be in a position to state definitely, on the authority of the Department, whether a boarding school will be placed on his Reserve or not. From our point of view, as well as that of the Department, such a boarding school is considered unnecessary, because the Red Deer Institute is within easy reach. But in view of the Chief's expressed determination to advise his people to send their children to the boarding school on Ermineskin's Reserve, if he cannot have one on his own Reserve, we are face to face with the question whether the Department and the Methodist Church intend to pursue a policy that must alienate the children on Samson's Reserve alike from the Red Deer School and the Methodist Church and send them elsewhere. The effect of this upon the Indians on other Reserves, I need not enlarge upon.\n\nHoping that we may have explicit statement of the policy of the Department respecting a boarding school on Samson's Reserve, I am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDuncan C.

Feb 20th, 1906.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D. D.\n33 Richmond St., Toronto.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 14th instant, I regret very much that the statement made in the report to the Indian Department should have been misleading. I stated that after November the 15th, the morning session was changed from 9 to 9.30, owing to the fact that the pupils could not get there any sooner during short days in winter, especially those who were some distance from the school, and did not repeat naming the hours in the afternoon session, for they were the same, there was no change made. I suppose I ought to have explained more fully that after three o'clock I usually practise the children in singing, drill or give some religious instructions, for the school always closes at four o'clock, and has ever since I came to the Reserve. I find this practice very helpful in getting the pupils to speak more loudly and promptly.\n\nNow regarding the reports, I always wrote the required number for the Indian agent to sign and send to the Department, and a copy for the missionary to sign and send to the Mission Rooms. Why they have not been sent I cannot explain unless that Rev. German our late missionary here, may probably have intended keeping them until the close of the year and sending them then, but may have forgotten. I entrusted it entirely to him. However I have kept some copies which I will send, and also the last report as you desired. In the future I shall forward them myself.\n\nI am very sorry that anyone should be led to think I have not\nbeen faithful regarding the duties of the school, for I have always tried to do all in my power to promote the interests of this school, and my work has not been confined to the school alone, but also to the homes of the community. I regret that Rev. German is no longer here, who could give you a good report of the work done, but I should like to refer you to Mr. Grant our Indian Agent who visits the school regularly and will be able to tell you all about it.\n\nCertainly the work is often very discouraging, as the parents are very often obliged to go away hunting or fishing, taking the children with them which makes the average seem very low, but they are gone for weeks at a time. Then too there is so much sickness often diseases that are contagious. While they are here their progress is splendid.\n\nWere it not that we who are engaged in the Indian work have entrusted all to the control of a Higher Power, the discouragements the loneliness would often seem too great to be borne, but we also take courage when we remember that our friends are upholding us in prayer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) S. Klippert.\n\nP. S. I was thinking that probably some one else might be more capable of taking this work than I, and while I know it is difficult to find any one willing to engage in the Indian work, I would continue until the end of this term, and if you could in the meantime secure another I would very willingly resign. I felt that I had been led to take up this work, and trust that I have not brought dishonor upon the cause of God.\nOttawa, March 6, 1906.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ult. with reference to the school hours in Sampson's school during the December quarter, last.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a letter giving similar explanations was received from the Indian Commissioner on the 17th ult., which were entirely satisfactory to the Department.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\n\nMiss S. Klipert,\nTeacher,\nSampson Indian Day School,\nPonoka, Alta.\nTo the Secretary,\n\nIndian Department,\n\nPanoka, Alta., Feb 20th.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI believe you have attended the work in the school on Samson's Reserve, as well being satisfactory. I thought the statements in the report were quite clear. I said after three. The hours in morning session were from 7:30 - 12:00. We made this change because during the short days it was impossible for the pupils to be on time. Those who lived some distance from the school. The afternoon session remained unchanged.\n\nI know that I ought to make have written perhaps a fuller explanation. I usually finish with the lessons at three o'clock. In the afternoon after three I spend some time in practicing the children in singing or in drill or calisthenics. Find the exercises helpful in teaching the Indian children to speak more loudly and obey more promptly.\n\nEver since I came here I have kept the school open until four o'clock and would like further information to Mr. Grant (Indian Agent) here, as to the time the school has been kept open.\n\nI know it must seem difficult to understand why the average is usually low. But there are\nOttawa, February 19, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th inst., and in reply I beg to say that the explanation with reference to the school hours at the school on the Samson reserve during the December quarter is satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your note of the 26th ultimo, I would say that on inquiry I find that a mistake was made in the school return in putting the hours at from 9.30 to 12 and omitting the hours of the afternoon session, which are as usual. I may say that it is the practice in this Country to have schools start half an hour later in the winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAsst.

Sir,\n\nI have to call your attention to the unsatisfactory condition of the day school on the Sampson reserve. The average attendance at this school has been less than three for some time back, and the teacher has not been keeping the school open during the prescribed hours each day. In September last, the school hours were only from 9 to 12 in the morning and from 1.30 to 3 in the afternoon, and since November 16 school was only open from 2.30 to 3, noon, with fifteen minutes intermission.\n\nThe Department does not see that it would be justified in continuing this school, unless it can be assured of their being a prospect of much better attendance, and it would, therefore, like you to enquire into the condition of affairs and have your views on the question of closing this school at an early date.\n\nThere are some white children attending, but the Provincial authorities will have to provide for them in case the school is closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

There is no doubt that a school ought not be kept open in the present conditions and I will refer the matter to Rev. J.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 19th July, 1901.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to call your attention to the unsatisfactory attendance at the Indian school on Samson's reserve which is conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church. For the past year the average attendance has been less than 2 and unless some means can be suggested of improving this state of affairs, the Department would not be justified in carrying on the school.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg,\nMan.\nThe work of the teacher is not capped at every turn. In the summer they are away making hay and in the winter they are away on hunting expeditions for two weeks or a month at a time. They almost invariably take their families with them so that the work of the teacher suffers in consequence. They are not only away but they are not properly cared for and this is shown in their inability to pay attention to their work when they do come to school. Under such conditions no real progress is impossible. The only solution to this difficult problem is that a small boarding school be erected.\nTo be sure, that hope will be there will be some chance for the teacher to see the results of his labor. There are also some families living altogether out of reach of the day school who would send their children to a boarding school but as they are now situated the children scarcely see the inside of a school.\n\nFrustrating that these requests will help to guide the Department in making its decision.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nWallace Jones\nTeacher.\nIndian Agent's Office,\nHobbs\n20 January 1899\n\nRef.: Letter No.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward school returns for quarter ended 31 December 1898 for Stansons and Louis Bull Bay schools, which were not received until the 14th and then had to be returned again.\n\nRegarding Stansons School, the late teacher Miss Smith left for Red Deer Industrial School and it was consequently closed during December.

Would advise a furnace or a large coal heater to be installed.\n\nC. W. Kirby,\nAgent.\nOttawa, December 16, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your report on the Samson's Indian Day School for the month of November, last, in which you advise that, as the building in which the classes are conducted is very hard to heat, a furnace or a large coal heater be installed, I beg to say that the Department would be prepared to provide a large coal or wood burning stove, but would not undertake to install a furnace, as the building is the property of the Methodist Church. You may, therefore, obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers handling stoves and purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price the stove which you consider would be suitable to meet the requirements. The stove pipes necessary may also be purchased.\n\nProperly certified accounts, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the stove, to which should be attached a memo showing the names of the firms which you asked to submit a price and the prices quoted by them.\n\nWhile a stove to meet the requirements should be obtained, it should be purchased as cheaply as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Now I am told that the Indians did not clean the chimney. I insisted that this should be done before the new stove went up. I would therefore suggest that this be done at once as if there is a fire in the building and it is destroyed we shall certainly claim damages. The Govt are getting the building free of rent and I think as to cleaning all\nThe pipes in the building the Department should do this. I would like to have the pipes of the whole building cleaned this week as the building is used daily for school purposes by the Dept. I think they should keep the offense. I would explain if you would attend to this at once as I am afraid of a fire breaking out. Miss Jenny cleaned the whole building on Saturday so I presume you will pay her more than usual. There should be a damper on the first long as the pipe otherwise there will be too much draft.\nAgain, I think some zinc or tin some sort should be put behind the store along the form so that it won't be needed.\n\nAnd I would be glad if you would attend to this advice as I am uneasy about things as they are.\n\nThank you\n\nYours in haste,\n\nRoy C. Taylor\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to herewith enclose a letter received from the Rev. R.C. Taylor, Methodist Missionary at Hobbema, in which he is asking the Department look after the cleaning of the church chimney and pipes.\n\nI have purchased the extra heater and pipes and had them put up in the church, or in that portion of which is being used for Samson's Day School. The same is now in good working order.\n\nThe Missionary should have attended to the cleaning of the church chimney etc during the summer or Christmas holidays, as it is a good days work for two men, and will necessitate the closing of the school again. This expense I consider should be defrayed by the Mission. The Department has done its share for the use of the building as a school.\n\nI am Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

The Department has recently supplied a stove and the necessary pipes for that portion of the building used for school purposes and it is considered that it has done its share in the matter.

Only the quantity sufficient to provide a midday lunch for a month should be purchased at one time, and when these supplies are exhausted, you should then arrange for the purchase of a further quantity. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred, and only the supplies absolutely necessary should be obtained. Properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred. You will be good enough to see that these supplies are delivered to the teacher and placed in her care. The Department will expect you to give this matter your early attention, after you have consulted the teacher as to the quantities of the various supplies that would be required.\n\nRegarding the janitor's services, I have to request that you will see that he performs his duties in a satisfactory manner. It is expected that he will see that the classroom is swept and dusted each day, and scrubbed at least once a month. He should also attend to the lighting of the fires in sufficient time in the mornings to have the classroom warm when the pupils arrive.

Sweet,\nTeacher of Sunday Day School.\nSir,\n\nIn compliance with your letter No II2-7-5, dated the 14th instant. I beg to state that I consulted the Teacher of Samson's Day School with reference to the supplying of a mid-day meal for the pupils. The Teacher informed me that she was not prepared to supply a mid-day lunch, unless the present arrangement were not satisfactory.\n\nYour letter dated March 1st, 1923, No. II2-7-5, authorized beef, flour, rice, and baking powder, and with the exception of the flour and baking powder (biscuits being used instead) these have been supplied from the Warehouse here to both Louis Bull's and Samson's Day Schools for the mid-day meal, during the past year. As Samson's Day School is held in a portion of the Methodist Church building there are no facilities for cooking, and the lunch during the year has been prepared for the pupils by Mrs. Taylor at the Mission house, without expense to the Department.\n\nThe supplies for this lunch have been sent to the school from here on Saturdays with the Farming Instructor of the Samson Reserve.\n\nWith regard to the janitor's services, I might say that I have instructed the Janitor as regards his work and informed the Teacher at the beginning of each term as to what\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nwhat work was required of him, asking her to let me know at the end of each quarter as to how the work was performed before I would voucher for his pay. The attached is a Certificate sent to me by the Teacher for the quarter ended December 1923 and from it I understood the janitor was performing his work satisfactorily. As the School is six miles from the Agency it is impossible for me to keep in touch daily, and in this matter more co-operation on the part of the teacher would be of assistance.\n\nThe above matters will have my continued careful attention and which I trust will be satisfactory.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nP.S. Since receiving the Department's last letter I have supplemented the ration to the schools, with tea, sugar, flour, and baking powder.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 11th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, regarding the preparation and serving of the midday meal for the pupils of the Samson's Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the arrangements for the serving of this meal and the supplies that are being furnished by you each week for the purpose have been noted. We note that there are no facilities in the building in which the school is carried on for the preparation of the meal, and that the same is prepared for the pupils by Mrs. Taylor at the Mission house. As long as Mrs. Taylor is willing to prepare this meal, there will be no need to alter the arrangements and have the teacher do the work. The teacher should, however, assist Mrs. Taylor as far as possible in the preparation and serving of the meal.\n\nWe note that the janitor is performing his services satisfactorily, judging by the certificate which you forwarded from the teacher. It is further noted that you have fully instructed the janitor regarding the work he is required to perform.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. G.

As yet no definite decision has been made in the latter regard.\n\nOur purpose in sending Mr. Doucet to the Hobbema Agency, to consider a possible site for a day school, is due to the fact that he was in the West and we thought that it would be advisable to have complete information available, in the event of its being finally decided to establish a day school.\n\nAs soon as a definite decision is made regarding the matter you will be further advised. In any event, it would not be necessary for you to include an amount for this day school in your agency estimates, as the money provided for the day schools throughout Canada is included in a lump sum.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A.G.B.

Education:\n\nPurchase of Robbema Public School:\n\nOn this date with Mr. Supt. Woodsworth, I went over the school building and grounds which are offered for sale by the Ponoka School Division for $6,000 with the hope that Metis children will share the facilities thus made available. Their presence is not desired in the white schools.\n\nThere is stated to be over three acres of ground, most of which has been cleared, levelled and is grass-covered\u2014one of the best playgrounds I have seen.\n\nThere is no well on the premises, water being obtained from a shallow well in the yard of a house one hundred feet away.\n\nElectric power has been carried to the house above.\n\nThe highway from Edmonton to Calgary passes the school.\n\nInside the school is 32 ft. long and 22 ft. wide. The main classroom is 23' by 22' with 50 ft. of blackboard and six feet of display board. The floors are of hardwood and are in good condition. The adjoining \"activity\" room, visible through a glass partition, is 9' by 12' and is well supplied with cupboards.\n\nThe movable furniture and the library books are not offered for sale. We will have to supply teacher's and pupils' desks, books and all the usual supplies. Local officials should at an early date supply Ottawa with the number of children in each grade who are to be admitted to this school in September so that supplies and equipment may be made available in sufficient time before opening-day.\n\nThere is a full basement containing a good furnace, two cloakrooms (each with a toilet-bowl of the yeast type) and a washstand for general use. The toilets are stated to have given trouble-free service. They appear to be in good condition and are odorless at this time.\n\nAltogether the installation is a bargain at the asking price, and I fully support the recommendation that it be purchased.\n\nIn the afternoon we attended a Board meeting of the Ponoka School Division. Present also were Mr. Ross, the local school superintendent, and Dr. Swift, deputy minister of the Alberta Dept. of Education.\n\nThe other party to the agreement into which it is suggested that the Dominion Government enter would be the Board of School Trustees of the Ponoka School Division (Secretary DeForest Nelson) and not, as in the case of the recent negotiations in Manitoba, the Provincial Government.\n\nI described the terms on which we have contributed to the capital cost and operating expenses of schools where Indian and white pupils are educated together. I did not suggest that we would require from the Ponoka Board a contribution toward capital cost because, privately, I think that what we are saving on construction cost might be reckoned as more than covering any contribution for which they would be liable.\nOperating costs were discussed at greater length. Those present agreed to consider the school a thirty-five pupil school. It is almost certain that there will be five Metis attending during the first year of operation; there could be ten such pupils, and I warned the Board that the proportion of Metis could increase sharply if the Director's instructions to Supt. Woodsworth (to eject trespassers) are fully carried out (see letter 754-1 (R.T.) 26 October, 1948), or if, to qualify for Family Allowances, additional Metis were to move in. The members of the Board appeared, however, to be reconciled to the early prospect of paying from fifteen to thirty per cent. of the operating costs which, I also warned them, were likely to be higher than those obtaining in some small schools because the Dominion Government makes no charge to Indians for anything connected with schools.\n\nDr. Swift read from the Alberta Schools Act to show that in calculating costs to be charged when one school district received pupils from another, the following items only are to be included:\n\n- Salary of teacher and janitor\n- Cost of classroom supplies used during the year\n- Cost of light, heat and water consumed\n\nTo these I think we should add (and mention in the draft agreement to be offered to the Board) maintenance and repairs for this particular building. It will have to be re-decorated in a lighter colour within a year or two.\n\nThe digging of a well and the extending of the powerline seem to be more our responsibility as capital costs linked with the construction of two more rooms and a teachersage on the same land.\n\nI stated that as a majority of the Indians who are likely to attend are adherents of the Roman Catholic Church certain provisions of the Indian Act apply. There was no objection made, but Mr. Ross, who inspects the Ermineskins Residential School, expressed the hope that only certificated schoolteachers would be considered for appointment.\n\nThere was one other factor that I thought worth mentioning. The Parliamentary Committee recommended that Indian children be educated wherever possible along with white children. They made no recommendation for setting up \"Jim Crow\" establishments as some people might call the proposed arrangement. I intimated that the opinion of the Alberta Indian Association might be sought.\n\nThe Board secretary is to send the account for the purchase of the school to Mr. Supt. Woodsworth in the near future.\n\nC.A.F. Clark,\nG.A.F. Clark,\nEducational Survey Officer.\n\nCAFC:\n\nC.C. to Regional Supervisor:\n\" Superintendent, Hobbema Agency.\"\nSuperintendent of Education:\n\nHobbema Day School:\n\nWith Mr. Supt. Woodsworth I again visited this school on Friday, June 10, particularly to see the Metis pupils who attend and to inspect their cumulative record cards.\n\nOn this occasion there was only one Metis present, a son of Daniel Spence who lives on a nearby road-allowance.\n\nThe teacher told me that she does not keep cumulative record cards for elementary pupils. It seems to be the rare one-room school in the western provinces which maintains these records in the manner presumably expected.\n\nThe teacher reassured us that the school has always been comfortably warm. She stated that the lighting, however, is poor on dull days.\n\nWhen the school closes at the end of June she intends to devote herself to her domestic duties.\n\nLater we toured the Metis areas, questioning the adults whom we found at home. Present indications are that there may be six Metis children likely to attend in September.\n\nIt might be advisable to declare to all concerned now that (if this school is purchased) that attendance for the next year will be restricted to those children within walking distance whose parents at recent treaty-payment declared themselves adherents of the Roman Catholic Church. This will allow the Ermineskin School to make early arrangements regarding discharges and admissions for next year.\n\nThe Superintendent might soon prepare a list of the homes in the above category which he considers that this day school could conveniently serve so as to provide thirty Indian pupils.\n\nC.A.F.

Electric power has been carried to the house above. The highway from Edmonton to Calgary passes the school.\n\n\"Inside the school is 32 ft. long and 22 ft. wide. The main classroom is 23' by 22' with 30 ft. of blackboard and six feet of display board. The floors are of hardwood and are in good condition. The adjoining 'activity' room, visible through a glass partition, is 9' by 12' and is well supplied with cupboards.\n\n..................................\n\n\"There is a full basement containing a good furnace, two cloakrooms (each with a toilet-bowl\nof the yeast type) and a washstand for general use. The toilets are stated to have given trouble-free service. They appear to be in good condition and are odourless at this time.\n\n\"Altogether the installation is a bargain at the asking price, and I fully support the recommendation that it be purchased.\"\n\nThis is a stucco school, and the total price for the building, three acres of land, coal-shed, tables, chairs and coal is $6,163.00. Mr. Indian Superintendent Woodsworth and Mr. Regional Supervisor Gooderham both recommend the purchase of this school at the price indicated, and I have prepared a submission to Council accordingly.\n\nThis school would be attended by Roman Catholic children presently attending the Hobbema Residential School. There are now at least seventy-five children of school age, mostly of the Roman Catholic faith, for whom there are no school facilities. The Ponoka School Division is erecting a consolidated school and, therefore, have no further need of this building. It is ideally situated for about thirty pupils who can walk daily to it. The Provincial Department of Education has also requested that we admit five or six Metis children for whom they will pay the regular tuition rates.\n\nI CONCUR IN THIS RECOMMENDATION\n\nActing Director.\n\nRecommendation forwarded to Council\n\n26/7/49\nMr. G.H.

Brown, RESERVES & TRUSTS\nDEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, CANADA.\n\nOttawa, April 23, 1949.\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Justice,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Orders in Council authorising the purchase of land or payment of compensation for expropriated land.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nOrders in Council authorising the acquisition of land almost invariably require that a good title, free from all encumbrances, be acquired as a condition precedent to payment of the purchase moneys. It frequently appears, upon title to land being searched by agents of the Minister of Justice, that the vendor's title is subject to a reservation in respect of mines or minerals or to easements or encroachments which do not affect the use of the land for which it is being acquired. In such cases, it has, in the past, been necessary to have the Order in Council amended to permit the purchase price to be paid for the land subject to the reservation, encumbrance or encroachments.\n\nTo avoid delays and inconvenience, I suggest, for your consideration, that, when authority is being sought from the Governor in Council for such transactions, the Report to Council should be so framed as to seek authority to pay the purchase money upon obtaining a good title free from all encumbrances, reservations or encroachments other than such encumbrances, reservations or encroachments as, in the opinion of your Minister, do not affect the use of the land for the purpose for which it is being acquired.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) W. R. Jackett,\nAsst. Deputy Minister.\n\nThe Deputy Minister,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nOttawa, 4th May, 1949.\n\nAttached hereto for your consideration is a copy of a letter from the Assistant Deputy Minister of Justice, dated the 23rd ultimo, referring to Orders in Council authorising the purchase of land or payment of compensation for expropriated land.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Jackett suggests that when authority is being sought from the Governor in Council for such transactions the Report to Council should be so framed as to seek authority to pay the purchase money upon obtaining a good title free from all encumbrances, reservations or encroachments other than such encumbrances, reservations or encroachments as, in the opinion of the Minister, do not affect the use of the land for the purpose for which it is being acquired.\n\n(sgd) W.

If, as stated, the facts are as above Order in Council P.C. 3859, dated the 3rd day of August, 1949, is not worded in accordance with instructions from the Department of Justice and requires amendment.\n\nPlease note the circular memorandum sent to all Directors dated the 4th May, 1949, to which was attached copy of a letter from the Department of Justice dated the 23rd April, 1949, copies of which are attached hereto for ready reference.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLegal Adviser.\nRe: Hobbema Day School\n\n1.

Since then, our Superintendent, Mr. Woodsworth, has met with the Board of the Ponoka School Division when it was stated that this school might be offered to our Department for $6,000.00. Mr. Woodsworth was instructed to get a letter in writing, together with plans of the building and the grounds that would go with it.\n\nApparently the Division has approached the Deputy Minister of Education in respect to this possible sale, as indicated by the attached copy of a letter from Dr. Swift, the Deputy Minister.\n\nIf you will refer to my letter of February, you will note that I have suggested that a school be purchased, if the price is satisfactory, and that a second school be erected by the Branch at Hobbema to educate Metis as well as Indian children.\n\nBefore I proceed further in an interview with the Provincial authorities, I wish to know your reaction and what possibilities there are of erecting a school for the Samson and Ermineskin Indians at Hobbema.

We understand further that it is intended to educate the Metis children of the vicinity in the same school. This appears to be a very sensible arrangement.\n\nWe should be pleased to know, however, what is contemplated with respect to the cost of educating the Metis children, both those who are the responsibility of the Ponoka School Division, by virtue of residence therein, and those who are in residence upon the reservation which is not a part of the school division.\n\nIt might be desirable, when you are in Edmonton, to visit us so that we may discuss the rather difficult problem of the Metis children.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.)

I am led to understand that no such addition is now proposed. Therefore, I respectfully submit a supplementary estimate for a day school building or class room to accommodate approximately 30 pupils. This building should be either built as an addition to the Hobbema Day School or at the site of the Ermineskin Indian Residential School.\n\nFor your information, there are at present 100 pupils of school age on this Agency, without school facilities. When the Louis Bull Day School is completed, this figure should be reduced by 30 pupils.\n\n[Signature]\nH. N. Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\n\nHHW/G\nc.c.

The various types are described in the attached Appendix.\n\nFluorescent lighting possesses some advantages over incandescent lighting and is recommended as first choice. Its first cost is higher but its power consumption is much less than incandescent lighting.\n\nOf the two incandescent types indirect lighting is recommended in preference to general diffuse because of its freedom from glare and its soft distribution, provided that the fixtures and lamps will be kept clean and the ceiling will not be allowed to become dirty or discoloured.\n\nIt is particularly suited in this case also because of the lower than average ceiling height. The glare from enclosing globes would be excessive.\n\n**FLUORESCENT** - illustrated on Plate 8 in group 2.\nLamps to be shielded by louvres, lens plates or diffusing glass or plastic.\nLamps per fixture: 4, 10-watt\nColour of lamps: ordinary white\nHeight: close to ceiling\nNote: Place the fixtures so that they are parallel to the line of vision of pupils.\n\n**INDIRECT** - illustrated on Plate 2, group 1, No. 2\nHeight: suspended 18 inches from ceiling\nHydro lamp: 500 watt bowl-silvered inside-frosted\nNote: Units of this type are less affected by accumulated dust than any other form of indirect lighting.\nDecember 9, 1949\n\n**Blackboard Lighting**\n\nThe blackboard lighting indicated on the drawing is according to Method No. 3 illustrated on Plate 7. If PAR-58 lamps should not be available R-40 flood lamps may be substituted.\n\nOther types of equipment, which may be either exposed or recessed into the ceiling as desired, are manufactured by the following firms:\n\n- Curtis Lighting of Canada Limited\n- Chadwick-Carroll Brass & Fixtures Ltd.\n- Ellis & Howard Limited\n- Holophane Company Limited\n\nThis equipment must be installed according to the manufacturer's printed or written instructions.\n\n**Lobby, Cloak and Wash Rooms**\n\nInstallation of enclosing glass is optional.\n\nHydro lamps: 60 - 100 watts, inside-frosted\nHeight: 8 - 10 ft. above floor\n\n**Basement**\n\n1 ceiling socket in open section\nHydro lamp: 150 watts\nOne plug receptacle near furnace\n\n**Entrance**\n\nEnclosing glass, type not important.\nHydro lamp: 100 or 150 watts\n\n**Painting**\n\nThe results for which these classroom lighting recommendations are planned will require white ceiling and light tinted upper walls.\n\nFrom the information received it would appear that the present ceiling finish does not meet this requirement and should be refinished.\n\n**Electric Wiring**\n\nAll wiring must conform to the regulations of the Electrical Inspection Dept. of the H.E.F.C.\n\nThe service entrance may be located wherever convenient. Conductors: 3 No. 8 wires in one inch conduit. Service Switch: 60 A. enclosed safety switch fused at 35 A., or a 35 A. air circuit breaker. Panels: 4 oct. D.F. type.\n\nBranch circuits may be concealed or exposed conduit, concealed cable, or surface raceway. For wire sizes see instruction on the drawing. Wall switches for classroom general lighting should be 20 A. T-rated.\nDecember 9, 1949\n\nComments\n\nIf indirect lighting is selected the fixtures and lamps must be wiped free of dust once a month and thoroughly washed three times a year. Also the ceiling must be repainted with matte white when it becomes discoloured or dull in tone.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGGC/JDC\n\nLIGHTING ENGINEER\nMETHOD NO. 3\nPROJECTOR FLOOD LAMPS\n\nLamp receptacles are mounted on cast metal condulets having a permanent fixed angle.\n\nLOCATION OF LIGHTS\nDistance of centre of condulet from wall is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of distance from centre of blackboard to ceiling.\n\nDETAIL OF COMPLETE FIXTURE\nCondulet\nLamp receptacle\nLamp\nLamp shield\nAPPENDIX TO SCHOOL LIGHTING REPORT\n\nThis appendix forms an essential part of the lighting recommendation\n\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nBenefits of Adequate Lighting\n\nThe necessity of adequate lighting in classrooms has been thoroughly established by scientific research and by actual experience. The cost of installing a good lighting system is small compared to the benefits accruing from it. Some of these benefits are: minimized eye strain, clear seeing from all parts of the room, increased efficiency of teacher, independence of variations in daylight, better progress and fewer examination failures, greater benefits to pupils with subnormal eyes, better discipline, and more cheerful surroundings.\n\nRequirements of the System\n\nThe principal requirements of classroom lighting are that it shall provide evenly distributed illumination of adequate intensity for all desks, with sharp shadows minimized and with the least possible glare.\n\nTypes of Lighting\n\nThere are three types of lighting that may be used for classrooms. The selection will be influenced chiefly by the cost of the fixtures, the provision for cleaning them regularly, and the maintenance of the ceiling in good reflecting condition.\n\nIndirect Tungsten Lighting. See Plate 2, groups 1 and 2\n\nThis is produced by projecting light to the ceiling from which it is distributed throughout the room. Consequently the ceiling MUST be maintained in a highly reflective condition: white or near white.\n\nIf the fixtures are of the OPEN type, units 1, 3, 4 and 5 of group 1, Plate 2, or those of group 2, they will collect considerable dust which will necessitate frequent cleaning. Unit No. 2, group 1 uses a BOWL-SILVERED lamp in which the reflector is deposited upon the inside of the bulb where dust cannot collect. Therefore, a reasonable accumulation of dust will not seriously reduce their efficiency. This is a decided advantage.\n\nThe quality of properly designed and installed indirect lighting is excellent - softly diffused light that is beneficial to the eyes.\nSemi-direct Tungsten Lighting. See Plate 2, group 4.\n\nThis lighting is produced by enclosing-glass units; No. 1, group 4 is of prismatic glass; units 2 to 5 are of white or milk glass. White glass units to comply with these recommendations must be greater in diameter than in depth.\n\nSemi-direct fixtures are satisfactory if they are of the specified size and shape, and suspended at the specified height.\n\nThe lighting is somewhat less refined in quality than indirect, but does not depreciate quite as rapidly from the accumulation of dust or discoloration of the ceiling.\n\nFluorescent Lighting.\n\nThis is much more efficient than tungsten and will produce twice or more as much light for the same amount of power. It has advantages for high intensity lighting. Fixtures with bare lamps fully exposed are not suitable for classrooms.\n\nIn school the pupils spend a considerable amount of time looking straight ahead at the blackboard or the teacher. If bare lamps are exposed to view the glare may be objectionable.\n\nWhen fluorescent lighting is to be used on 25 cycle power, the utmost care is needed in the selection of fixtures that will minimize the flicker that is caused by the 25 cycle power.\n\nRelative Cost.\n\nFluorescent lighting is higher in first cost than tungsten lighting, particularly in 25 cycle districts. Indirect tungsten is next, and semi-direct tungsten the lowest.\n\nBlackboard Lighting.\n\nIt is most important that all the pupils be able to see distinctly the work that is written on the blackboards. Most blackboards reflect glaring light that prevents clear seeing.\n\nThe most effective way of overcoming this is to shade the windows that admit the glaring light and illuminate the blackboards by supplementary units installed especially for the purpose.\n\nMaintenance.\n\nAll lighting fixtures collect dust, particularly indirect open type fixtures of any kind. Dust absorbs and wastes light. This wasted light is paid for but not received. Cleaning of lighting equipment is just as necessary to a lighting system as lubrication to an automobile.\nMaintenance (Cont'd)\n\nDo not let the ceiling become dull with age. Dark ceilings increase glare and reduce the efficiency of the lighting.\n\nAllowance for Depreciation.\n\nIn the preparation of this recommendation an allowance has been made for natural depreciation of the lamps and the accumulation of dust on the lighting equipment between cleaning periods. The lighting will therefore appear higher in intensity when the system is new than it will after a few months' use.\n\nWiring.\n\nThe importance of adequate wiring is evident from the fact that a 10% voltage loss, due to inadequate current-carrying capacity, will cause a light loss of approximately 24%. The minimum wire size is noted on the drawing. This size is based on a maximum voltage loss of 2%, which is in accordance with good wiring practice. (In no case should wire smaller than No. 12 B & S Gauge be used for branch circuits).\n\nWindow Shades.\n\nAttention is directed to the proper use of window shades. They are installed particularly to shield the desks near the windows from direct sunlight.\n\nIt is only under the MOST favourable conditions that the desks farthest from the windows receive fair daylight illumination. When the window shades are drawn over the upper half of the windows, the illumination on desks farthest from the windows may be decreased 60% or more, depending upon the local conditions.\n\nConclusion.\n\nThis plan has been carefully prepared for this particular school. Emphasis is placed on the importance of providing lighting in accordance with present-day standards. REDUCTION OF THE NUMBER OF FIXTURES, OR THE SUBSTITUTION OF SMALLER LAMPS OR INFERIOR LIGHTING EQUIPMENT WILL RESULT IN INFERIOR LIGHTING THAT WILL NOT PRODUCE THE DESIRED RESULTS. The following steps are necessary in order to take full advantage of the benefits of better lighting.\n\n1. Install the lighting outlets as indicated.\n2. Insist on adequate wiring with wire sizes shown on the drawing.\n3. Install only mogul-socket fixtures for classroom lighting (for tungsten lamps).\n4. Select the type and size of fixture specified.\n5. All electrical work must be approved by your District Electrical Inspector.\n\nSupervising Lighting Engineer.\nH. N.

Besides giving each a small gift, I would like them to have some treats - candy - nuts - oranges, etc. Since I cannot afford to do both, could we raffle some article, blanket for example, with the proceeds to go for the treats?\n\nIf this is permissible, we will display whatever we choose at the store, make our own posters and tickets, which the children will sell.\n\nI know that everyone will support this by buying tickets since it is for such a cause.\n\nIf obligatory, we will send a contribution to Red Cross or Children's Fund.\n\nWill you please advise me if I may go ahead with this plan.\n\nThank you.\n\nYours truly,\n\"Edna Northcott\"\n\nCOPY/ehg\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Hobbema Indian Day School\nChristmas Concert\n\nAttached find copies of correspondence concerning the matter of providing treats for children attending this school, on Friday December 16, 1949 at their Xmas concert.\n\nThere must be a similar problem and solution in other Indian Day Schools that are in operation across Canada.\n\nThe Indian Chief and Councillors have suggested that the $20.00 or so needed be provided from their Band funds on a per capita basis, as children of all four Bands attend this school.\n\nYour early advise would be appreciated.\n\nH.N.Woodsworth,\nSuperintendent.\n19 December, 1949.\n\nMr. H. H. Woodsworth,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nHobbema, Alberta.\n\nHOBBERA INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nPlease find attached the Lighting Specifications prepared for the Hobbema Indian Day School. Would you please obtain tenders from electrical contractors for the installation of Fluorescent lighting as provided for in these plans. You will note that the Department prefers Fluorescent lighting for the classroom rather than indirect lighting. The Fluorescent lighting fixtures are to be as illustrated on plate 8 in group 2. Please note the other item in classroom lighting, namely the special lights for the blackboards.\n\nThe installation of lights in the lobby, basement, entrance, etc., are as listed on page 2.\n\nYou will note that a white ceiling will be needed and the upper walls will have to be tinted in a pastel shade, preferably green.\n\nThe other details are self-explanatory.\n\nBernard J.

Woodsworth, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nHOBBEMA,\nAlberta.\n\nReference is made to your letter of December 7th, 1949, your file 112-6-3, in connection with the Hobbsma Indian Day School Christmas Concert.\n\nIt is realized that it is now too late to furnish the Christmas treat for the children at the Day School for this year. However, the practice in many other Reserves is to have the Council of the Band concerned request by resolution an expenditure from their Funds for this purpose. When you have been notified of the approval of the resolution, accounts could be submitted covered by your voucher in the usual manner. Presumably an expenditure of $20.00 would be divided among the Bands on a per capita basis. This is for your guidance in the future.\n\nA.G.

We had obtained a price from Mr. Fee of Wetaskiwin of $570.00 which was afterwards increased to $600.00, but we understood this offer to be for the erection of the school by day labor with himself as foreman. It afterwards appeared that he was acting for Mr. S.H. Reist, a contractor of Wetaskiwin, and the intention was to pay the lump sum of $600.00 for the building erected from plans and specifications which had been approved. This slight misunderstanding delayed the matter and the telegram of September 23rd which I prepared was not sent.\n\nI think it important that this small building should be erected immediately. The Minister has the authority under the provisions of the Public Works' Act to make arrangements for the construction of works without public tender under certain conditions. The condition which governs in this case is \"Cases where the estimated cost of the work is less than $5,000 and appears to the Minister, in view of the nature of the work, that it is not advisable to invite tenders.\" The work may also be considered as one of pressing emergency as the present school buildings are\nat an inconvenient distance from the school teacher's residence and extremely cold in winter weather. I would, therefore, recommend that Ministerial authority be obtained to carry out the arrangement.\n\nOttawa, 16th October, 1911.\nI beg to herewith enclose a duplicate copy of two letters which I wrote to the Department on the 5th instant.\n\nI have not as yet received any reply to them, and fearing that they or your answer may have gone astray in the mails I am writing you again.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir\u2014\n\nWith further reference to my letter of July 24th, and to your of August 25th, re proposed erection of a temporary day school building beside the teacher's residence on Samson's Reserve. I beg to inform you that when I interviewed Mr. Frank Fee about putting up the building for $570.00 he stated that his first estimate and sketch was made in a hurry and he had omitted to include certain things, and would not take the contract less than $600.00. I then wired you on the 28th last.\n\nOn receipt of your telegram of the 1st inst. I went to Wetaskiwin to see Mr. Fee as to erecting this building by day labour under himself as working foreman. Mr. Fee refused to have anything to do with the building by day labour. Mr. Fee is the foreman of Contractor S.H.Reist, and was taking the work for Mr. Reist.\n\nMr. S.H.Reist will contract to erect the building required with Mr. Fee as his foreman, as per specifications herewith enclosed for the sum of $600.00\n\nI might state that it is impossible to hire day labour to erect this building, and would recommend that the Department accept this offer, as I find it reasonable considering the cost of day labour and material here.\n\nWill you kindly return the enclosed specifications to me.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOffice of the Indian Agency,\n\nSIR,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 3106 & 3107, amounting to $10.00\n\nfor Glass for Samson's Day School residence, and Gasoline for Agency Gasoline Pump Engine.\n\nThis Expenditure was authorized by Departmental Estimates 1911-1912.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nGeo.

would be at the Joblens Agency in May to look over and report on the Day School situation, and he would like the Chief and Indians interested in a Day School to meet Major Clark and make their recommendations to him. There are two Baptist missionaries now teaching on the Ontonabee Reserve without any assistance from the Department, at their new Baptist Church on the Ontonabee Reserve, there are from 10 to 15 children attending these classes. There are also 15 pupils now in the two Residential schools, but there is no more accommodation for more pupils now. If the Ontonabee Band wish to have a Day School started on the Ontonabee Reserve, they should put their case before Major Clark when he comes to Joblens, as they have enough children of school age on their reserve to warrant a Day School.\n\nA.M. Woodsworth,\nSuperintendent.\nMay 24, 1948.\n\nColonel Neary:\n\nHobema Superintendent,\nBaptist Mission and school on the Montana Reserve:\n\nWith Mr. T.G. McLeod I went to the m/n reserve on May 16, proceeding part of the way by truck, finishing the journey across flooded areas in a wagon drawn by a team supplied by a white farmer, Mr. Bill Davis of Ponoka.\n\nIn the accompanying photo Mr. McLeod is shown seated in the Baptist church-school. At his left are Miss Twila Bartz and Miss Cecilia Priebe.\n\nMiss Bartz is an American college graduate with a teaching certificate from North Dakota. Miss Priebe is not a certificated teacher. They state their denomination as the North American (formerly it was \"German\") Baptist Church \u2014 baptism of adults by complete immersion \u2014 with headquarters at Forest Park, Illinois. They have, indeed, a closer depot, The Christian Training Institute in Edmonton. The head thereof is the Rev. F.W. Benke whose address is 10231 96th St., Edmonton.\n\nThese young ladies started in Edmonton during the winter and resumed their work on the reserve about April 25.\n\nThe building which they used was erected by the denomination primarily as a church. Comfortable living quarters are included at the back. They use water from a creek, boiling it, of course. I also saw the place where they began work \u2014 a little log cabin owned by an Indian named Standing-in-the-road. Living quarters consisted of a trailer which is still standing in the yard.\n\nThey have an enrolment of nine pupils with an average attendance of eight. The denominational status of these children is as confirmed and it is at Louis Bull.\n\nThey seem to have obtained sufficient school supplies at church expense. What they want mostly is official recognition.\n\nI had an unexpected conversation with the Rev. Mr. Benke. He took the seat beside me on the train from Nordegg to Rocky Mountain House (he had been working among the Indians) and knowing that a school at Bighorn was under consideration, he tried to supply a teacher. I told him that the position might eventually be advertised. At a previous meeting with the Indians they told me that they wanted the school \"Protestant\". They have a Methodist-United Church tradition.\n\nC.A.F. Clark\n\nCopy to Mr. Goodwin.\nMay 31, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. D. J.

He advises me that a building has been erected by the denomination, primarily as a church, but that a school is also being conducted there. The teacher is Miss Bartz, who holds an American teaching certificate from North Dakota. They have asked for official recognition of the school and payment of the teacher. I understand from Major Clark's report that these Indians are mainly of the United Church faith. I would therefore appreciate your comments as to whether they are working in coordination with your missionary efforts on this reserve.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

I am sending a copy of it to Dr. Hart in Edmonton. Dr. Dorey will be there from September 4th to 6th and no doubt among other matters will be discussing the issue you have raised in this correspondence. I have asked him to send along any recommendation or report any decision to be sent to you.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nM. C. Macdonald\nHobbema Indian Agency\n\nFile: 112-6-3\n\nHOBBEMA, Alberta,\n15 October, 1948.\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n507 Public Building,\nCALGARY, Alberta.\n\nRe: Montana Day School\n\nFor your information, I beg to report the Montana Day School will be in operation during the coming winter.\n\nThe missionary teacher is Mr. Newman, a veteran of the last war, and having seen service in Italy and elsewhere. He and his wife and two children are accommodating themselves in the rear of the church and are building an addition before winter. I have met them, and find them to be most suitable.\n\nAt the dedication of the Church, on October 10th, the children who have been in attendance at the school for the past year or two, gave an impressive demonstration of what they have been taught. Children ten and twelve years old spoke in perfect English. A year ago, some of these children could not speak a word of English, like their parents, and usually presented a fairly primitive appearance.\n\nAs the presence of this school involves such matters as payment of Family Allowances and general administration, I would be glad of your comments. I am sure it would be very difficult for the Department to get teachers to labor and live among the Indians as these people do. I would suggest that some aid be given to the school, say in the form of scribblers and readers. I am sure that they will be welcome and well used.\n\n(sgd.) H. N. Woodsworth,\nSuperintendent.\n\nHNM/ehg\nB. F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Baptist Mission and School, Montana Reserve,\nHobbema Indian Agency.\n\nReference is made to Major Clark's report of May 24th on the above. I am now attaching copy of Superintendent Woodsworth's letter of October 15th in which he reports that the school will be in operation during the coming winter under the supervision of a missionary teacher, Mr. Newman.\n\nWe wrote Mr. Woodsworth on the 19th, asking for the average attendance at the school, as well as Mr. Newman's qualifications. Mr. Woodsworth replied that the average attendance is 15 children and that Mr. Newman is not a qualified teacher. He has Grade 9 standing and, in addition, attended the Bible School at Edmonton, which is under the jurisdiction of the Baptist Church.\n\nThere seems to be no doubt that the North American Baptist Church is making some progress on the Montana Reserve. The children are at least learning to speak English. Mr. Woodsworth asks that we at least supply some scribblers and readers to help them along this year. We assume that this can be done, but wonder if you can suggest any other way in which we can materially assist this school.\n\nFor your consideration, please.\n\nG. H.

I recently discussed the situation with Dr. Dorey and he advised that he would have no objection to the Department recognizing this school.\n\nI would like to have an opportunity of discussing this problem with you.\n\nBernard F.

It is our intention, following our conversation, to recognize this as a private school in which Indian children are receiving education. This means that we will be able to pay to the authorities responsible for this institution a tuition fee for each child in attendance. We cannot at the present time establish it as an Indian day school within the meaning of the Indian Act but can recognize it as indicated in the above paragraph. This will serve to confirm our conversation in this regard.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

This brings up the following questions:\n\n1. Am I authorized to pay Family Allowances for the children attending this school, according to the Family Allowances Act?\n\n2. Should I have the teacher keep a day school record of attendance to fall in line with this?\n\n3. Will this school be entitled to school supplies such as readers, scribblers, etcetera?\n\n4. Should I require regular medical inspection of the school?\n\n5. Should I have inspection of the school by the School Inspector?\n\n6. Should I send in my inspection report, as I do with the Residential school?\n\n7. Should I have the children attending this school authorized by the Department?\n\n8. Being a day school, the children require a hot noon lunch which they do not bring. At present the Missionary is supplying this.\n\nAttached please find copies of a document handed to me by a group of the Montana Indians about a month ago which has some bearing on this school. This church school has the support of the majority of the Montana Band, but in my opinion the distance some children have to go is too great.\n\n(Cont'd page 2)\nDirector Indian Affairs Branch - Re Baptist Mission and School, Montana Reserve\n\nHowever, this may be met by the fact the missionary has a truck which could pick up most of the children quite easily, as the trails are in fair condition. This factor cannot be overlooked.\n\nH. N. Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\n\nEnclosure\nHNW/chg\nCol. B. F.

N. Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\n\nEnc. 2\nHNW/ehg\nHobbema Indian Agency\n\nHobbema, Alberta\n23 February 1949\n\nDirector\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nAttention: Mr. B. F. Neary\n\nRe: Baptist Mission Day School\nMontana Reserve, Hobbema Indian Agency\n\nWith reference to your 112-2-1 (E) of 10th January, 1949, I beg to submit a list of those at present enrolled at the Baptist Mission school, Montana Reserve. There are ten in regular attendance and a potential ten more who have applied to go. Of these ten, the majority are going to the Edmonton Indian Residential School and some to the Ermineskin Indian Residential School.\n\nBefore three interpreters, the Resident Nurse, the Farm Instructor and myself, nearly all the Montana Indians claim to adhere to the teaching and doctrines of the Baptist church.\n\nMr. R. Neuman has a grade IX standing, plus three years education at a Baptist College in Edmonton, which I am informed, has a good standing in Educational circles. He is a veteran of six years service with the army and was in the First Division serving in Italy. He seems to be as well qualified as any teacher on the Hobbema Indian Agency. It is hoped that all teachers, regardless of religious denomination, be at least of normal standing in the near future.\n\nGood work is being done by Mr. Neuman and wife since their arrival. They have organized sewing clubs among the Indian women, feed their pupils a noon meal, plan to plant a school garden this spring, and in general are carrying out a program of education which as a whole is showing results, and such that no other church organization has done to date, due to the fact that they are in close contact with the Indians as family units.\n\nH.

However, we have sent a good stock of school supplies and a number of Progress Report forms with a Register. As this is a private school, we will not be able to add Mr. Neuman to our salary list at the present time. I hope that this will be possible at a later date. In the meantime, would you please forward, each month, a voucher made out in his favour and reading as follows:\n\n\"To Tuition fees of ......

I readily concur with your suggestion that the savings be kept until the individual attains the age of twenty-one years or marries, as a general policy. I am continually amazed however, at specific cases of young people of seventeen or over who have exhibited mature judgement in the spending of their savings. There is the case of Marcella Lightning who applied all her savings this year to buying a sewing machine and even went to work at a white farmers in order to make up the difference. At present, I have a girl (Maria Wildcat) recently discharged from the Ermeliekin School, who has decided not to withdraw her savings until she can get $60.00 or more to enable her to purchase a sewing machine. She is working for various white people to try to attain this end. This girl is also needed at home to aid her widowed mother support a large family. At the conference of Superintendents in Canada last April, this matter was discussed. At that time, it was pointed out and to which I agree, that the critical period of an Indian life is from the time he leaves school until he gets his feet. He or she is released from discipline into a world of low standards and he must adjust to cope with this situation, without further aid or guidance.\n\nI am continually appalled by the lack of opportunities for the Indians on this Agency. They live in the centre of one of Canada's wealthiest areas and near enlightened centres, yet over a hundred and possibly one hundred and fifty children will never be able to attend School. As you are aware, no school has been built on this Agency since 1890. I see children of people whom I have known since birth sinking gradually into poverty and ignorance as a result. The children who can not find facilities in school are getting married, legally or otherwise, at the ages of 14 years to 18 years. They provide a great problem and I suggest that any arrangement regarding saving this group should be kept in mind. I would appreciate receiving specific instructions as outlined above, and in the meantime, will discourage any further withdrawals. In the case of Barney Montour, I will inform him and his parents that he will have to keep his savings until he marries or attains the age of 21 years. For your information, he is helping his father on a successful farm.\n\nH. N. Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\nROUTE SLIP\n\nPASS TO:\n\n1. T.S.\n\n2. Col.

There are two Baptist missionaries now teaching on the Montana Reserve without remuneration from the Department, at their new Baptist Church on the Montana Reserve, there are from 10 to 15 children attending these classes. There are also 15 pupils now in the two Residential Schools, but there is no more accommodation for more pupils now. If the Montana Band wish to have a Day School started on the Montana Reserve, they should put their case before Major Clark when he comes to Hobbema, as they have enough children of school age on their Reserve to warrant a Day School.\n\nH. N. Woodsworth,\nSuperintendent.\nMay 24, 1948.\n\nColonel Neary:\n\nHobema Superintendency,\nBaptist Mission and school on the Montana Reserve:\n\nWith Mr. T.G. McLeod I went to the m/n reserve on May 18, proceeding part of the way by truck, finishing the journey across flooded areas in a wagon drawn by a team supplied by a white farmer, Mr. Bill Davis of Ponoka.\n\nIn the accompanying photo Mr. McLeod is shown seated in the Baptist church-school. At his left are Miss Twila Bartz and Miss Cecilia Priebe.\n\nMiss Bartz is an American college graduate with a teaching certificate from North Dakota. Miss Priebe is not a certificated teacher. They state their denomination as the North American (formerly it was \"German\") Baptist Church \u2014 baptism of adults by complete immersion \u2014 with headquarters at Forest Park, Illinois. They have indeed, a closer depot, The Christian Training Institute in Edmonton. The head thereof is the Rev. F.W. Benke, whose address is 10231 98th St., Edmonton.\n\nThese young ladies stayed in Edmonton during the winter, and resumed their work on the reserve about April 25.\n\nThe building which they use was erected by the denomination primarily as a church. Comfortable living quarters are included at the back. They use water from a creek, boiling it of course. I also saw the place where they began work \u2014 a little log cabin owned by an Indian named Standing in-the-road. Living quarters consisted of a trailer which is still standing in the yard.\n\nThey have an enrolment of nine pupils with an average attendance of eight. The denominational status of these children is as confused as it is at Louis Bull.\n\nThey seem to have obtained sufficient school supplies at church expense. What they want mostly is official recognition.\n\nI had an unexpected conversation with the Rev. Mr. Benke. He took the seat beside me on the train from Nordgaar to Rocky Mountain House (he had been working among the Indians), and, knowing that a school at Bishop's was under consideration, he offered to supply a teacher. I told him that the position might eventually be advertised. At a previous meeting with the Indians they told me that they wanted the school \"Protestant\". They have a Methodist-United Church tradition.\n\nC.A.F. Clark\n\nCopy to Mr. Woodham.\nMay 31, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. D. J.

He advises me that a building has been erected by the denomination, primarily as a church, but that a school is also being conducted there. The teacher is Miss Bartz, who holds an American teaching certificate from North Dakota. They have asked for official recognition of the school and payment of the teacher. I understand from Major Clark's report that these Indians are mainly of the United Church faith. I would therefore appreciate your comments as to whether they are working in coordination with your missionary efforts on this reserve.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

I am sending a copy of it to Dr. Hart in Edmonton. Dr. Dorey will be there from September 4th to 6th and no doubt among other matters will be discussing the issue you have raised in this correspondence. I have asked him to send along any recommendation or report any decision to be sent to you.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nM. C. Macdonald\nHobbema Indian Agency\n\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n507 Public Building,\nCALGARY, Alberta.\n\nRe: Montana Day School\n\nFor your information, I beg to report the Montana Day School will be in operation during the coming winter.\n\nThe missionary teacher is Mr. Newman, a veteran of the last war, and having seen service in Italy and elsewhere. He and his wife and two children are accommodating themselves in the rear of the church and are building an addition before winter. I have met them, and find them to be most suitable.\n\nAt the dedication of the Church, on October 10th, the children who have been in attendance at the school for the past year or two, gave an impressive demonstration of what they have been taught. Children ten and twelve years old spoke in perfect English. A year ago, some of these children could not speak a word of English, like their parents, and usually presented a fairly primitive appearance.\n\nAs the presence of this school involves such matters as payment of Family Allowances and general administration, I would be glad of your comments. I am sure it would be very difficult for the Department to get teachers to labor and live among the Indians as these people do. I would suggest that some aid be given to the school, say in the form of scribblers and readers. I am sure that they will be welcome and well used.\n\n(sgd.) H. N.

Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Baptist Mission and School, Montana Reserve,\nHobbema Indian Agency.\n\nReference is made to Major Clark's report of May 24th on the above. I am now attaching copy of Superintendent Woodsworth's letter of October 15th in which he reports that the school will be in operation during the coming winter under the supervision of a missionary teacher, Mr. Newman.\n\nWe wrote Mr. Woodsworth on the 19th, asking for the average attendance at the school, as well as Mr. Newman's qualifications. Mr. Woodsworth replied that the average attendance is 15 children and that Mr. Newman is not a qualified teacher. He has Grade 9 standing and, in addition, attended the Bible School at Edmonton, which is under the jurisdiction of the Baptist Church.\n\nThere seems to be no doubt that the North American Baptist Church is making some progress on the Montana Reserve. The children are at least learning to speak English. Mr. Woodsworth asks that we at least supply some scribblers and readers to help them along this year. We assume that this can be done, but wonder if you can suggest any other way in which we can materially assist this school.\n\nFor your consideration, please.\n\nG. H.

This brings up the following questions:\n\n1. Am I authorized to pay Family Allowances for the children attending this school, according to the Family Allowances Act?\n\n2. Should I have the teacher keep a day school record of attendance to fall in line with this?\n\n3. Will this school be entitled to school supplies such as readers, scribblers, et cetera?\n\n4. Should I require regular medical inspection of the school?\n\n5. Should I have inspection of the school by the School Inspector?\n\n6. Should I send in my inspection report, as I do with the Residential school?\n\n7. Should I have the children attending this school authorized by the Department?\n\n8. Being a day school, the children require a hot noon lunch which they do not bring. At present the Missionary is supplying this.\n\nAttached please find copies of a document handed to me by a group of the Montana Indians, about a month ago which has some bearing on this school. This church school has the support of the majority of the Montana Band, but in my opinion the distance some children have to go is too great.\n\n(Dont'd page 2)\nDirector Indian Affairs Branch - Re Baptist Mission and school, Montana Reserve\n\nHowever, this may be met by the fact the missionary has a truck which could pick up most of the children quite easily, as the trails are in fair condition. This factor cannot be overlooked.\n\nH. N. Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\n\nEncl.\nHNW/ehg\n507 Public Building,\nCALGARY, Alberta,\nJanuary 6th, 1949.\n\nCol. B. F.

There are ten in regular attendance and a potential ten more who have applied to go. Of these ten, the majority are going to the Edmonton Indian Residential School and some to the Ermineskin Indian Residential School.\n\nBefore three interpreters, the Resident Nurse, the Farm Instructor and myself, nearly all the Montana Indians claim to adhere to the teaching and doctrines of the Baptist church.\n\nMr. R. Neuman has a grade IX standing, plus three years education at a Baptist College in Edmonton, which I am informed, has a good standing in Educational circles. He is a veteran of six years service with the army and was in the First Division serving in Italy. He seems to be as well qualified as any teacher on the Hobbema Indian Agency. It is hoped that all teachers, regardless of religious denomination, be at least of normal standing in the near future.\n\nGood work is being done by Mr. Neuman and wife since their arrival. They have organized sewing clubs among the Indian women, feed their pupils a noon meal, plan to plant a school garden this spring, and in general are carrying out a program of education, which as a whole is showing results, and such that no other church organization has done to date, due to the fact that they are in close contact with the Indians as family units.\n\nH.

However, we have sent a good stock of school supplies and a number of Progress Report forms with a Register. As this is a private school, we will not be able to add Mr. Neuman to our salary list at the present time. I hope that this will be possible at a later date. In the meantime, would you please forward, each month, a voucher made out in his favour and reading as follows:\n\n\"To Tuition fees of ...... Indians children attending Baptist Mission School, Montana Reserve .......... $ ...........\n\n(The amount paid will be the average attendance of pupils for the month multiplied by $5.00 per pupil, i.e., if the attendance is 8.5, then tuition fees will be 8.5 x 5, or $42.50.)\n\nThis voucher will be supported by the monthly Day School Report form used in all our schools. I do not think that Mr. Neuman or yourself will have any difficulty interpreting this form.\n\nBernard F.

N. Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\n\nEncl. 6\nGAL/ehg\n\n(W.B. names included in statistics for private school)\nWith reference to your 94-112 (T-3) of March 10, and to your comments regarding the present policy of allowing a child to withdraw his savings as soon as he is discharged from School. I readily concur with your suggestion that the savings be kept until the individual attains the age of twenty-one years or marries, as a general policy. I am continually amazed however, at specific cases of young people of seventeen or over who have exhibited mature judgement in the spending of their savings. There is the case of Marcella Lightning who applied all her savings this year to buying a sewing machine and even went to work at a white farmers in order to make up the difference. At present, I have a girl (Marie Wildcat) recently discharged from the Ermineskin School, who has decided not to withdraw her savings until she can get $60.00 or more to enable her to purchase a sewing machine. She is working for various white people to try to attain this end. This girl is also needed at home to aid her widowed mother support a large family. At the conference of Superintendents in Calgary last April, this matter was discussed. At that time, it was pointed out and to which I agree, that the critical period of an Indian life is from the time he leaves school until he gets his feet. He or she is released from discipline into a world of low standards and he must adjust to cope with this situation, without further aid or guidance.\n\nI am continually appalled by the lack of opportunities for the Indians on this Agency. They live in the centre of one of Canada's wealthiest areas and near enlightened centres, yet over a hundred and possibly one hundred and fifty children will never be able to attend school. As you are aware, no school has been built on this Agency since 1890. I see children of people whom I have known since birth sinking gradually into poverty and ignorance as a result. The children who can not find facilities in school are getting married, legally or otherwise, at the ages of 14 years to 18 years. They provide a great problem and I suggest that any arrangement regarding saving this group should be kept in mind. I would appreciate receiving specific instructions as outlined by you and in the meantime, will discourage any further withdrawals. In the case of Barney Montour, I will inform him and his parents that he will have to keep his savings until he marries or attains the age of 21 years. For your information, he is helping his father on a successful farm.\n\nH. N. Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\nROUTE SLIP\n\nPASS TO:\n\n1. T.S.\n\n2. C.F.

Woodsworth I visited this school on the morning of Friday, June 10.\n\nThere were nine pupils present. The register showed that these were the most dependable of those enrolled.\n\nThe room, which is primarily a church, is a model of neatness and cleanliness.\n\nThe walls are attractively decorated with pictures, posters and examples of the pupils' work.\n\nThere is a commendable emphasis on health habits and personal grooming. The children seem to be developing a self-propelled desire to acquire civilization.\n\nVery good progress has been made in reading by the younger pupils, and the older pupils appear to evince greater interest in other school subjects. Someone, either Mr. Newman or his predecessor, seems to have given momentum to the mental life of these children.\n\nThe pupils have planted an extensive garden, divided into plots which will be judged for prizes toward the end of this month. The work is integrated with classroom activities.\n\nThis is not an authorized Indian School, but it might be possible for the Department to assist further in the education of these children by donating any of the following:\n\n(a) Some desks\n(b) about eight feet of blackboard (photos will follow showing the meagre writing surfaces now available)\n(c) a drinking-water container.\n\nSome parents will have to be further instructed regarding truancy, family allowances, and church-affiliation regulations. For example, the mother of two children who left Brimneskin School to attend here does not receive allowances for them on the ground that, for the remainder of this school year, they are considered truants; and yet at recent treaty-payment she again declared herself\nan adherent of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nI have requested the Superintendent to supply us with the form for \"Potential School Enrolment\" completed for each denomination according to the stand taken by parents at the latest treaty-payment.\n\nC.A.F.

We are, therefore, requisitioning for these.\n\nNeeded are:\n\n1. A blackboard.\n2. Desks or tables - fifteen.\n3. A drinking fountain and sanitary cups.\n4. Cocoa and crackers for a noon meal for a possible 15 pupils or more, for the year 1949-50.\n\nAt present, Mrs. Neuman, wife of the teacher, is preparing a hot drink and biscuits for the children, at their own expense and considerable trouble to herself as she has two small children.\n\nWe do not know the type of blackboard required. Mr. Clarke will be able to suggest something. We are unable to estimate the amount of cocoa or biscuits for 15 pupils, or what is allowed.\n\nAttached, find requisition for these articles, in quadruplicate.

I find that this school which started from nothing is progressing in a manner favorable to the welfare of the Indians.\n\nThere are sixteen pupils in attendance compared with nine of last year. Some of these pupils belong to the Samson Band which I presume is in order.\n\nThe teacher is very appreciative of the aid supplied by the Department in the way of the cups, blackboard, water cooler, books and desks. They were badly needed and with the increase in pupils are a necessity. A noon meal is supplied by the school, the wife of Mr. Neuman performing this function. I suggest that this is a large endeavor.\n\nRecently we received authority to purchase as per departmental list certain janitor supplies and sanitary necessities amounting to a total of $90.20. I suggest these would be very useful if not necessary for the health of the children attending this school. Could the purchase of these supplies be authorized?\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.N.

N. Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\n\nEncl.\nWetaskiwin, Alberta\nSeptember , 1949\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOTTAWA, Canada\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI would like to make my application as a teacher for the day school of the Montana reserve in Alberta.\n\nI attended high school in Wetaskiwin where I completed grade twelve this year. I am now entering the University of Alberta where I will take up the course leading to the certificate of Junior Elementary and Intermediate, in the Faculty of Education. My plan is to continue studies by means of summer school.\n\nFor several years, I have assisted in mission work on some reserves near Hobbema. During the last few years I have been instructing for several weeks of daily vacation bible school, held on these reserves. One summer I assisted Miss Twila Bartz a qualified teacher; for several weeks; while she was conducting school on the Montana Reserve during the summer months.\n\nIn the course of time I will be pleased to fill out applications forms.\n\nWould you kindly advise me further in the near future.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Felicity Strohschein.\"\n\nAddress: 10810 78 Avenue\nEdmonton, Alberta\nOctober 14, 1949.\n\nMr. H. N. Woodsworth,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nHobbema, Alberta.\n\nBaptist Mission School.\n\nReference your 112-6-3\n\nI note that you have provided a sum in your estimates for the erection of a proper day school to replace the present private school being operated.\n\nWe do not wish to encourage the establishment of private schools on Indian reserves and therefore cannot give too much encouragement to such establishments, especially when we are in a position to provide our own schools.\n\nYou have been previously advised as to the rate of remuneration which we can pay for pupils attending this school. Until we have erected our own school, it will not be possible to pay the teacher in any other way than that outlined in our previous letter of March 26, 1949.\n\nI presume that Miss Strehschein is interested in teaching in this school by September 1950. I also presume that she is of the same religious denomination as that of the Indian children attending this school, as provided for in Section 100 of the Indian Act.\n\nIt is of course understood that all supplies forwarded by the Department to this private school remain the property of the Department and will be transferred to our own school if and when such a building is provided.\n\nCopy sent to\n\nBernard F.

Woodsworth, Superintendent\n\nVoucher No. 650\n\nDate: 7 October 1949\nMontana School:\n\nWith Mr. Supt. Woodsworth I visited this school on Friday, Oct. 14th.\n\nThere were sixteen Indian children present. The capacity of the building (a church) is about twenty-four. The probability is that more and more children will be attracted to attend this school which those in charge are using as a civilizing agent in a variety of ways.\n\nCare will have to be exercised that Indians are not permitted to withdraw their children from other schools without observing all the legal and administrative checks. On the previous day we had to take back to Ermineskin Residential School an older girl who wanted to enjoy the greater freedom and happy atmosphere of this \"popular\" school.\n\nThere appears to be a movement of families from other reserves to this sparsely-populated reserve, and the demand for a Departmental Day school will become increasingly insistent. Erection of a one-room school with teacherage should be planned for next year.\n\nThe pupils, and the Department, are presently receiving full value for the five dollars per pupil-month that the Department allows. The school is well-conducted. The missionary-teacher, though uncertificated, is gaining skill, and the pupils are making fair progress. A generous lunch is served, and the teacher even conveys some pupils to and from school, both to ensure attendance and to avoid misbehaviour en route.\n\nI suggest that, to obviate any criticism that these pupils are not receiving the full programme allowed elsewhere, the usual allowances for school lunches be made available.\n\nC.A.F.

Clark during his recent visit. Both he and I found the first two paragraphs of your letter confusing. For your information, a day school for the Montana Reserve was placed in our estimates to replace the private school now in operation on this reserve. This, I understand, conforms with Departmental policy. There are now 18 pupils in attendance at this school. The question of their religious affiliation has come up from time to time. I believe by far the majority are now of the Baptist faith.\n\nMiss Strohschein is the daughter of a local farmer who is a Baptist. I understand that she is attending Normal School in Edmonton and will be available for teaching some time in April or May whenever the Normal School closes. As she will soon be a qualified teacher, I suggest her services should be secured, and that the missionary Mr. Neuman, at present carrying on teaching in their church, should be relieved of his duties, which is unqualified for, though doing his best at.\n\nH.

Woodsworth,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nHobbema, Alberta.\n\nDear Mr. Woodsworth:\n\nHerewith I am enclosing the letter from Miss Felicite Strohschien of Wetaskiwin, Alberta, expressing her wish to become the teacher in the Montana Reserve Day School. Would you kindly forward this request to the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa? Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Neuman and myself are well satisfied with the ability of Miss Strohschien. She has been along quite frequently in the different types of mission work among the Indians. And has a special fondness to teach Indian children. The Neuman's will arrange with her about board and room.\n\nMay I kindly ask the following about this school on the Montana Reserve: Is this school now fully recognized by the Department of Indian Affairs as a Government Day School?\n\nWill the teacher receive full Government pay when she takes up her duties by the beginning of May, 1950 at the completion of her studies at the University?\n\nIn one of our former conversations you mentioned that having the school in our church we would therefore be entitled to receive rent. Would you kindly take this up with the proper officials and let me know their reaction. We are pleased to have your frequent visits to our school and the interest that you show. You have no doubt noticed that church and school in the one building is rather crowded. But we are willing to carry on for a while in such crowded conditions so that our dear Indian friends may receive a better education. But we hope that the time will soon come when the Government will erect a school and rooms for the teacher on the Montana Reserve. I am sure that you are giving these vital matters your thoughtful concern and are urging the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa to take action in the not too distant future. It would be good. Would you kindly give me the information about the Montana Day School as above stated as soon as you find it convenient. Much obliged.\n\nReceived with many thanks the permit from the Department of Indian Affairs to erect a Baptist Church on the Bull Reserve. I have forwarded this valuable document to our Mission Headquarters for their further thoughtful and prayerful consideration. And they will take action as soon as feasible. We want to do our best for these people both old and young.\n\nWe have also good prospect for a Normal School teacher to take over the new school on the Bull Reserve as soon as it is finished and open for class instruction. Would you please keep me informed as to the developments of the school.\n\nThanking you for your kind consideration and helpful suggestions.\n\nYours for the Welfare of the Indians.\n\n\"Fred W.

We are completing plans for a building project erection in the summer of 1950.\n\n(b) The teacher will be classified according to our salary schedule when the Department school opens in either September or October depending upon when it is completed.\n\nIt is normally our practice to advertise for teachers for the new schools which we are erecting. You might discuss this matter with Mr. Gooderham and find out whether he considers it worthwhile to advertise for teachers for both the Louis Bull and Montana (when the new schools are completed).\n\nBernard F.

Any child entering the school will be subject to instructions in that religion. Furthermore, anyone making an application for admission to the proposed Montana Day School is definitely signifying that he wishes his children brought up in the religion taught at that school. The school will be officially known as the Baptist Mission Day School. This is not a Government school but a private school on which the Government will pay a grant according to the number of pupils attending. The grant will be expended to the best advantage by the religious body conducting the school. Superintendent mentioned also that it should be clearly understood that once a child is admitted to school, if the child misses five consecutive days, his family allowances will be cut off. The head of each family wishing to have his children admitted was then called up in turn and questioned as to what religious faith he followed, which was entered into the treaty record books.

H. Gooderham's office, during a recent visit suggest that quotations might be secured for the Montana Day School at an early date. This school was placed in our 1950-51 estimates. If all plans were developed before April 1st, 1950 and tenders accepted, an early start on the school might be made. This would be of double use, by first enabling the school to be completed in good weather by September 1st, 1950, and secondly, employing Indian labor in this year of crop failure and thereby relieving the financial stress of the Indians.\n\nOur experience in the construction of the Louis Bull Day School has brought out a very important feature lacking in Plan 888; that is basement construction. I have been informed by competent individuals that a full sized basement could have been constructed at less cost than the present foundation. I am also of that opinion.\n\nThe construction of a full sized basement would have solved such things as storage space, heating problems, recreation and workshop facilities. The Hobbema Day School is a model of efficiency in this line, having a full basement and furnace.\n\nI am pointing out this feature so that if possible, consideration may be given to amending plan 888 when used on the Montana Reserve. Otherwise, we are well pleased with the school.\n\nH. N.

If the cost is reasonable in comparison to tenders received on similar schools in Alberta, then the Montana school should be erected on a day labor basis.\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to Mr. Woodsworth.

Clear approximately 2 acres of brush for school site.\n\n2. Cut a line through the brush on the proposed site of the school comprising approximately 4 acres.\n\nThe proposed site of the new school will be approximately one half mile north of the Baptist church which is located in the south-east corner of Section 29. This should place the school almost in the centre of the Montana Reserve, west of the proposed north and south road through the Montana Reserve. There is an iron survey peg near the Baptist church which we will use as a basis of locating the school.\n\nIn order to ensure accurate location, the cutting out of the road allowance as a line, is important.\n\nI consider $15.00 per acre to be a fair price for brushing and burning.

You were going to have the cost of the Louis Bull school checked; if the final cost was reasonable, I believe we should use the same crew on the Montana school. Mr. Woodsworth should advise if the same carpenters are available on day labour basis and what the hourly rates will be.\n\nIf there is any other information you require, please advise so that we can get this building started.\n\nG.

Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nUnder separate cover you are today being sent the preliminary blue prints for the new building being erected this summer at the Cariboo Residential School, Williams Lake, B.C.\n\nThis is the building we thought would fit our requirements at Hobbsma. You will note that it provides for a dormitory building now which can be converted later for classroom use. The ground floor now provides two large dormitories and washroom facilities. Later it can be converted to classrooms or playrooms.\n\nThe first floor already provides two dormitories which could be converted to four classrooms. You will note that the perforated lines show where the corridor and cloakrooms would be placed later.\n\nHobbema Residential School\n\nOur main consideration at Hobbema is to use the funds available to provide dormitory accommodation for the children. Later when funds are provided for the main administration building, this unit can be used for classroom purposes.\n\nYou will note that I am also sending the Boiler House blue print. This will provide heat for the buildings shown in Index 923 and also for the main administration building.\nto be provided later. This main administration building will contain the dormitories, kitchens, laundry, staff quarters, etc.\n\nMorley Residential School\n\nI would appreciate your comments on the suitability of this plan also at the Morley Residential School. We have noted carefully Mr. Pugh's plan and his letter of April 27. It will be necessary probably for you to discuss this plan with the Principal of the school and with Mr. Pugh's successor.\n\nThe immediate need is for about 100% more classroom space and about 50% more dormitory space. If you used the top floor for classrooms and the bottom floor for dormitories would this be a satisfactory solution? The classrooms provide for 160 children and the dormitories for about 80. It might be possible to have Grades I to VI only at Morley and to send the Junior High School pupils to Edmonton. There we have spare accommodation and intend to investigate the possibility of sending the Junior High School pupils to the Edmonton Public School.\n\nBernard F.

I did not realize that this plan would lend itself more easily to the addition of another classroom when needed. I also agree that you should advertise for tenders for construction of this school.\n\nRe: Montana Day School #1\n\nI agree that Plan 888 should be used for this school and that construction should begin as soon as possible so that it will be ready by September 1st.\n\nMy main purpose in preparing for early construction of these schools is that good teachers can more easily be found if we can offer them a school commencing September 1st. It is more difficult to find a good teacher if the school opens in the middle of the term. Furthermore, our task of assigning pupils as between day schools and residential schools is made much easier if the new day schools are opened at the proper time.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Woodsworth, together with a copy of yours, and I am asking him to expedite quotations on drilling of the wells.\n\nG.H.

Neary, Superintendent of Education, Indian Affairs Branch of April 24th and May 4th, 1950, in which you request a quotation be submitted for a well on the site of the proposed Montana Day School, be expedited. I beg to submit a quotation from A. Knie and Son of Leduc, well drillers. These men have drilled all the wells on the Hobbema Indian Agency in the past few years and have assured us good and adequate water supplies in nearly all cases. I recommend them to you.\n\nYou will note that they have quoted at $1.40 per foot. As no wells to date have been drilled on the Montana, the depth of the well is only speculative and no one can be sure of its exact depth or for that matter, if water exists. From wells in the surrounding countryside, I would estimate a well of over three hundred feet which would cost around $420.00 to drill.\n\nMr. Knie also estimating on this basis, has indicated the amount of casing, pipe and other well equipment. We are submitting a requisition for these supplies as estimated. If there is a surplus of pipe or casing, we will write for authority to buy it for Band wells. If there is insufficient, we will requisition for that needed. As soon as authority is given to drill the well and the site is accurately located, (see Montana Band resolution for survey) we can proceed. We have sufficient Band casing and well equipment to supply, pending replacement.\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. N. Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\nHobbema Indian Agency\nDept.

She completed her normal training at the University of Alberta this year and is now a Certificated Teacher. It is hoped she can be employed.\n\n(2) Materials: Mr. Woodsworth has requisitioned for these as well as the furnishings for both school and teacherage.\n\n(3) Well: Attached is a quotation from Mr. A. Knie Well Drillers of Leduc, Alberta. These men have drilled all the wells on the reserves at Hobbema in the last few years and have rendered satisfactory service. Mr. Woodsworth has requisitioned for the casing and other equipment. Since no wells have been drilled in the vicinity of the school site it is impossible to say how deep the drillers will have to go, but Mr. Woodsworth estimates that they may have to go to 300 feet, which would cost around $420.00 to drill. If water is found at a lesser depth and there is surplus casing and pipe, it can be purchased by the Band for Indian wells. Will you please authorize him to employ Mr. Knie on the basis of his quotation of $1.40 per foot?\n\n(4) Labour: Mr. Jim Potts and crew are available to construct this school. Mr. Woodsworth requires an accountable advance of $200.00 to pay labour.\n\nG.H.

Gooderham  \nRegional Supervisor Indian Agencies  \n507 Public Building  \nCALGARY, Alberta\n\nRe: Montana Bay School\n\nI beg to inform you that the Ponoka School Division has a splendid one-room school east of the town, known as the Shultz school. It is about five years old, but has been used only three years. It is 20 x 40 in size, with a cloak room and library. It is finished with insul-brick and inside with tin-tex (unpainted).\n\nIt has a basement under it at present, and a furnace.\n\nThe school division want $4,000.00 for this building as it stands, without the furnace. They estimate the cost of moving the building to the Montana Reserve would be about $700.00. If this building were constructed at present prices, it would cost at least $8,000.00 minus basement. Mr. Ross, the school inspector of the Ponoka School Division, highly recommends the building for classroom purposes.\n\nThe Ponoka School Division has another school west of Hobbema, known as the Poplar Forest school, for which they want $2,500.00, as it stands. It is not as new as the Shultz school and does not compare with it generally. However, it is worth the money and would provide an adequate classroom space.\n\nI would recommend that the Shultz school be acquired and placed on the Montana Reserve, with a basement installation. This very good buy is due to the consolidation of school units in the Ponoka School Division. Possibly Major C.A.F. Clark could investigate further this opportunity. The Poplar Forest school might be acquired also, if the price is reasonable, as an additional unit. This should also be investigated by Major Clark. The money saved and the fact of getting a school ready for September should justify consideration of these purchases. With the money saved, possibly more units could be opened at Hobbema, which are urgently needed.\n\nH. N. Woodsworth  \nSuperintendent  \nHobbema Indian Agency  \nDept.

Gooderham  \nRegional Supervisor Indian Agencies  \n507 Public Building  \nCALGARY, Alberta\n\nRe: Construction, Montana Day School\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 19th, addressed to the Superintendent of Indian Education, and confirming our conversation and your written note on the above noted subject. I beg to inform you that Jim Potts and crew have agreed to report to Rocky Mountain House and build school in that area, in about two weeks time.\n\nThe Montana Day School proposed in the Hobbema Indian Agency can either be built by contract or by foreman contract labor, desired.\n\nH. N. Woodsworth  \nSuperintendent  \nHobbema Indian Agency  \nDept. Citizenship & Immigration\n\nc.c./Director, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa  \nMr. T.G. McLeod, Assistant, Rocky Mountain House\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Montana (Hobbema #3) Indian Day School\n\nFurther to my letter of May 19th and yours of the 20th, James Potts and his Indian crew will erect the log school unit on the Sunchild Cree Reserve and, therefore, their services will not be available for the Montana school.\n\nAt a meeting with Superintendent Woodsworth, his Assistant Agents and Chief Crane at Hobbema on the 27th instant, it was suggested that Mr. George Lee of Red Deer be employed as foreman in the building of the Montana school. Lee is a mixed blood, who is well known at Hobbema as a competent carpenter foreman. Mr. Woodsworth stated that Lee would be prepared to take the position of foreman and employ an Indian crew, provided he was paid at the rate of $1.50 per hour.\n\nAs it is most desirable to employ Indians where possible in the construction work on Reserves, I am recommending that his employment be approved at the rate he demands.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nGHG/lo\nc.c. Mr. Woodsworth\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Montana Indian Day School\n\nFurther to ours of the 15th, file 112/6-1-4, I promised the Assistant Agent at Rocky Mountain House that I would endeavour to get an Indian building crew to erect the log day school and teacherage on the Sunchild Cree Reserve. Mr. MacLeod is very well acquainted with the Indians in the Hobbema Agency where he was Farming Instructor for 26 years, and assures me that they could do this work better and at less cost than if an endeavour was made to find a white crew. At present a white crew is hard to obtain.\n\nOn my return from Treaty payment I stopped at Hobbema and asked Superintendent Woodsworth not to give Mr. Jim Potts and his crew a contract to erect the Montana School until further instructions.\n\nAs the two frame schools, Plan 888, are to be erected at Hobbema, it is my suggestion that tenders be called. This would release the Indian crew for the Sunchild Cree unit.\n\nYou will be advised after I have discussed this further with Mr. Woodsworth.\n\nG.H.

It is presumed that we will have your comments in due course. I would strongly recommend that your building supervisor examine this building first.\n\nWe must also obtain a specific tender on the moving of the building. The Poplar Forest school may be too old to withstand moving. The Shultz school might stand this treatment.\n\nIn any event we must remember that the purchase of one or the other of these schools will not provide us with a teacher's residence.\n\nBernard F.

The requisitions were sent to you on May 12th with complete details. Mr. Geoderhan has requested advice as the foreman-carpenter is ready to begin work but the materials have not yet arrived nor is there any sign of purchase orders having been issued.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMontana Indian Day School:\n\nWith Mr. Sup't. Wordsworth and Mr. Far Supervisor Sklad I again examined proposed sites for this school. The most suitable site is still the one agreed upon with the late Rev. F.W. Benke.\n\nThis site is at the N.E. corner of the N.E. quarter of Section 20. This will place it near the junction of two road allowances.\n\nThe land for playground slopes gently toward the south, allowing for drainage. Very little clearing will be required.\n\nThe mission will be on the opposite side of the east-west road allowance. There is good water there, which augurs well for a good well at the school. Authority and an accountable advance to explore for water is recommended.\n\nMr. Wordsworth and I were shown a good school which the Ponoka district wants to sell. It is shown in the accompanying photos. This school could be moved on to the site during the vacation, and be ready to operate at the first of September. Construction of a new school at this point would be a protracted operation. In the present, we could omit a teacherage, as the candidate for the position (Miss Felicity Stroschen, whom I have interviewed) would board at the mission.\n\nMr. Sklad is preparing a plan of the site. The school which is offered for sale should be oriented with the main windows facing easterly.\n\nC.W.

Woodsworth,\nSuperintendent,\nHobbema Indian Agency\n1. Pursuant to instructions received from Mr. G.H. Goodhart, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies the above work was undertaken on May 25th and completed on June 5th. In the a.m. of the 25th, accompanied by Asst. Agent Moreauville, the proposed site was visited and examined and in the p.m. the work commenced. A plan of Township 43, Rge. 24, West of the 4th Meridian was secured from the Provincial Technical branch and this showed that some thirty-five years ago a line had been established from a point 24 chains north of the N.E. corner of Sec. 6, due north on a bearing of 270\u00b0.01 to the former Methodist Mission Reserve on the Battle River. Assisted by two Indian Arrows, I reopened this line and the remains were found. These were barely discernible and the stakes are gone. This line was opened to the N.E. corner of Sec. 20 and at this point stellar observations were made to determine the true meridian. The magnetic declination here was found to be N 23\u00b0.30E. The line was then continued 4000 chains to the S.E. quarter of Sec. 29 and the N.E. corner of the \u00bc-section established. A line was then opened due west 4 chains, 46.9 links and a stake set. At this point a long rectangular field lying north and south was encountered and this field was crossed on a due west bearing and a second stake set 5 chains west of Stake 1. At Stake 2 the line was run due south 8 chains and stake 3 set and the line then was turned due north. This provided the boundaries of a proposed school site containing 4 acres.\n\n2. On the 31st the land occupied by the school in the Hobbs Settlement and the land adjoining to the south (2 lots) were measured and the boundaries checked. The total content was found to be 29.93 sq. chains. The true boundaries of Lots 7 and 8 were located by the use of the transit.\n\n3. On the 1st, Maj. C.A.F. Clarke of the Welfare Division stated he wished to go to Hobbs and whilst there he examined the proposed site. He decided the school might be located to more advantage near the Baptist Church. A site was then laid out for the school grounds and the building site staked out. Information with regard to this is contained in the attached plan. The corners of the school site are located on the ground and marked by 2x2 wooden stakes. The building site in the grounds has also been staked at the four corners. It will be seen that no levels were taken as this additional work did not seem to be necessary. The building site is practically level. The church building was determined as to location with respect to both road allowances and the school building site aligned to the church. All measurements were chained and checked by stadia.\n\n4. Instruments employed in this work were secured from the University of Alberta Engineering Dept. and the transit was checked in the laboratory and again in the field to assure it being in adjustment. On the the Indian arrows, Alex Mackay, assisted throughout the entire work and is familiar with all locations shown on the attached plan.

S. Gee, cement and gravel contractors of Ponoka, which indicates that he will complete the basement for the Shults school for a price of $1,197.25. If yeast toilets are installed which are in the present school site, he quotes a price of $280.00 additional to install the system. This covers only the disposal system, not the fixtures which are two toilets.\n\nIn view of the quotation received, the Shults school, minus the furnace, should cost:\n\n| Item       | Cost   |\n|------------|--------|\n| Building   | 4,000.00 |\n| Moving     | 712.00  |\n| Basement   | 1,197.25 |\n| Sewage     | 280.00  |\n\nTotal: $6,189.25\n\nAt this price, we will have a school equally as good as the Hobbema Day School at approximately the same cost.\n\nI recommend a small teachersage be built which if it cost $4,000.00 (and it should not exceed that amount) will give us a school unit not exceeding my original estimate of over $10,000.00.\n\nH.

He states he will move the Shultz school from its present location to the Montana Reserve Day School site and place it on a foundation there, preferably a basement, for the sum of $712.00. The school is at present on a basement foundation and the moving would be twenty-three miles.\n\nI consider that this charge is very reasonable and agree with estimate submitted by Mr. Ross.\n\nAs yet, we have not received quotations on the construction of the basement. I recommend, because it conforms with the school plan, that a basement containing a furnace and yeast toilets be placed under the school. The basement construction should be completed before moving is done. As soon as quotations are received I will forward them for your consideration. When drilling the well, I have taken into consideration that the well be included in the basement which will mean a slight change in the basement as compared with the present basement plan. This is advisable to prevent freezing and enable extension of water service. The casing can be pulled for repairing as it will clear the wall.\n\nI know you will agree with this arrangement.\n\n[Signature]\nR.M. Woodsworth\nSuperintendent\nHobbema Indian Agency\nDept.

He explains that in addition to the casing already purchased the drillers recommend the purchase of 280 feet of 2\" casing at $1.25 a foot. This casing will be placed inside the present 3\" casing so that they can seal off the water presently seeping into the hole as it is not good water. They will then drill down perhaps another 100 feet hoping to find water deep down i.e. around 400 feet. Mr. Superintendent Woodsworth says that the only good wells in this area are deep wells. In fact, the only really good well we have is at the Hobema Day School. Even Ermineskin Residential School has not a first class well. At Louis Bull we had to go down almost 500 feet.\n\nThe drillers recommend that we stay with the present hole as almost exactly the same performance might have to be followed elsewhere.\n\nAs this additional action is likely to double the original estimate and authorized expenditure I told Mr. Woodsworth that we must first seek Ministerial approval. He has agreed to call in the driller and with his help compose a night letter describing the situation and giving a new estimate with his recommendation.\n\nC.A.F.

We would be very pleased to do this but for the fact that our Architects have not yet completed the Hobbema Day School plan. The Montana School is now being advertised and we will advertise the Hobbema School immediately the plans are finished.\n\nIt is very likely that the same contractors will bid, naturally, for both projects.\n\nBernard F.

Woodsworth, Esq.,\nSuperintendent,\nHobbema Indian Agency\nHOBBEMA, Alberta.\n\nRe: Montana Day School\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of July 5th, file 112/6-1-723, in which you outline the difficulties encountered in obtaining water for the a/m school.\n\nBefore any decision can be made in this connection will you please ascertain from the well driller if this mud can be cased off and the present hole drilled deeper. If this can be done, what would the extra cost be for casing?\n\nIf Mr. Knie does not think it feasible to continue with the present well, it is suggested that he drill a new hole not less than 5\" in diameter so that if the mud formation is again encountered it could be cased off and the well continued with a smaller drill. If the latter procedure is recommended, please submit cost per foot of drilling a 5\" hole, also the cost of casing. Before this work can be proceeded with, it will be necessary to obtain the Department's approval.\n\nG.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nHM/mg\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Well, Montana Day School - Hobbema Agency\n\nSuperintendent Woodsworth advised you on the 4th by wire that the drillers failed to obtain water at 265 feet. He then wrote this office to say that the mud formation was so bad that the well drillers did not like the looks of the situation and left the site until further instructions.\n\nOn receipt of this I wrote him as per the attached copy of a letter, as it has been my experience that a 3\" hole is too small where it is anticipated that quicksand and mud will be encountered. The drillers may state, however, that by driving the 3\" casing to the water line, satisfactory results may be obtained.\n\nYou should receive a copy of Mr. Woodsworth's report.\n\nGHG/lo\nAtt.\n\nG.

This recommendation was approved by the Minister.\n\nWe are now advised by Indian Superintendent Woodsworth that a depth of two hundred and sixty-five feet has been drilled but water has not been obtained.\n\nThe well-driller has recommended to our Superintendent that the drilling should be continued to a depth of five hundred feet and the driller believes that if this is done there is a reasonable likelihood of securing water.\n\nThe additional expenditure for labour and casing etc., will be $536.80.

Instructions were given to have Mr. Dawson, the Surveyor who was at the Agency to establish the roads to the east and north. This was done and Mr. Gee was advised that his tender was accepted, as was Mr. Frizzell's removing the school. On the 6th I was again at Hobbema when the actual site of the building was staked out to leave the well on the north west corner. Mr. Gee moved on to the location that day and was instructed to cement a pit on the well site connecting with the basement of the school. I did not have an opportunity to inspect the Poplar Forest and Manito Schools which you refer to in your letter of August 31st file 721-5 but Mr. Battle had inspected them and advised that the Manito was in his opinion the better building to be converted into a teacherage. I instructed Mr. Woodsworth to contact the Secretary of the Ponoka School Board and ascertain what was the lowest that the Board would accept and at the same time to get a bid from Mr. Frizzell for moving the school and alternate bids from Mr. Gee, as quickly as possible and advise this office.\n\n1. Eighteen hundred dollars is the price set for the school by the Board and no reduction can be anticipated.\n2. Mr. Frizzell will move the school a distance of about (20 miles), place it on a foundation with new wooden plates for $648.90.\n3. To date no bid for the basement has been received from Mr. Gee but it is my estimate that he will ask for at least $1,000.00 to erect retaining walls and a half basement; $1,400.00 to erect a full basement.\n\nFrom the foregoing it must be assumed that the total cost of putting this building on the site to be in the neighbor-\nhood of $4,000.00. The alterations to make it suitable for a teacherage should include the dropping of the ceiling + 2 partitions & possible insulation and small repairs and a furnace, which is estimated to cost $2,000.00. The total cost should not exceed $6,000.00.\n\nI recommend the purchase of the building and a full basement unless there is a considerable difference between a full and half basement, which is not anticipated as a half basement is not economical since retaining walls must be erected.\n\nA good teacherage could not be erected for less and certainly it would not be as big as this building. As it is badly needed, I hope that authority can be given immediately to purchase and accept the tenders so that Mr. Gee might remain on the site and do the teacherage basement on completion of the school basement.\n\nUnder separate cover, I am writing you regarding the use of the Baptist Church and teacherage until such time as the school and teacherage are ready for occupancy.\n\nAs quickly as possible, kindly wire.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe: Montana Day Schools,\n\nMr. Newman, the Baptist Missionary on the Montana Reserve, has been most co-operative in the operation of a school among these Indians. As the Baptist Church is not receiving any grant, he has asked that a rental be paid for the use of the church and for the room supplied to the teacher until the Indian school and teacherage are ready to occupy. This is a very fair request and it is recommended that a rental of $25.00 per month be paid for the use of the church and $15.00 per month for room rent.\n\nThe Missionary quarters are very crowded as Mr. Newman has a large family and it is our hope that the teacherage will be ready for use before the end of the current year.\n\nG.

I am sending to you a plan of a small building which we have used for agency clerks' residences and would appreciate hearing from you as to whether you feel it would be satisfactory. We have a bill of materials for this plan and can order these materials at once if you will send an army message to the effect the building will be satisfactory.\n\nCould the same crew erect this building who will be responsible for the new school at Hobbema No. 2?\n\nThis new building may cost about $5,000.00 but at least we have a proper teacherage and not a building which has been moved and adapted for use as a house.\n\nBernard F.

IF ANY PRIORITY CAN BE OBTAINED MR GEE WILL ACCEPT CARLOAD CEMENT\".\n\nFurther to the above, I beg to state that it is practically impossible to obtain supplies of cement in this area. Mr. Gee is a local contractor who uses large supplies of cement, and if he is unable to secure any, it looks as if the completion of this school will have to be postponed until cement supplies are available.\n\nG.

You will note the Indenture is not signed by the representative of the Ponoka School Division. This was not signed on the advice of Mr. G.O. Noble, the lawyer to the School Division, until the Department had approved the adding of the words \"by and at the expense of the bargainer\", which has been initialed by them.\n\nIn signal to Mr. Gooderham dated 23 August 1950 the moving of the Shultz School at a cost of $712.00 by Mr. Webb Frizzell of Lacombe was authorized being additional to the purchase price.\n\nWhen the additions to the Indenture is authorized by you and returned we will arrange for the matter to be concluded by having the signature of the officials of the Ponoka School Division added to the Indenture.\n\n[Signature]\nH.N.

The success of the former has, in no degree, equaled that of the one at Whitefish Lake. This want of improvement is easily traceable to the teachers. Had these schools been conducted by trained and qualified teachers, of whom there is so dearth, the progress made might have been conspicuous, as that which the teacher at Whitefish Lake can show.\n\nExtract from Annual Report from Agent Ross of Saddle Lake Agency for 1894.\n\n(Original on 113219)\nSir,\n\nMr. Agent Ross in his Annual Report on the Goodfish Lake Agency makes the following remarks in regard to the Saddle Lake Indian School:\n\n\"The schools at Saddle Lake, Whitefish Lake and at Whitefish Lake remain under the supervision of the Methodist Church. The success of the two former has, in no degree, equaled that of the one at Whitefish Lake. This want of improvement is easily traceable to the teachers. Had those schools been conducted by trained and qualified teachers, of whom there is no dearth, the progress made might have been conspicuous as that which the teacher at Whitefish Lake can show.\"\n\nThe attention of the Methodist Church authorities should be called to the Agent's remarks as to the want of properly qualified teachers and they should be asked to remedy this state of affairs if possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy Supt:Genl:\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nIndian Agent's Office,\nSaddle Lake\n1st May 1897\n\nRef.: Your Letter No.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report that the Rev. Martin E. Kinnick, Methodist Missionary in Saddle Lake Reserve, also Teacher at the Day School in the same Reserve, has received orders from his church authorities to move at once to White Horse Lake.\n\nThis will necessitate the closing of the school until the arrival of another Teacher which I suppose is having the attention of the Responsible Authorities. I am not aware whether the Appointment is in the hands of the Department or the Church.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, No. 236, reporting the removal of the teacher of the day school at Saddle Lake and the consequent closing of the school until the arrival of another teacher, and stating that you are not aware whether the appointment is in the hands of the Department or the Church. In reply I have to inform you that while the Department has hitherto left the appointment of teachers of Indian schools in the hands of the Church authorities carrying on missionary work in the vicinity, it has decided that in future all new appointees shall possess proper teaching qualifications, equal at least to a provincial third class certificate, and the Church authorities should be so informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nV. Gibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, and to say that I have seriously considered the matter of closing the Saddle Lake day school. I am not prepared to make a recommendation to this effect just now, but will do so at an early date if no improvement is shown.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nToronto, 3rd Jan., 1864.\n\nTo Indian School at Saddle Lake.\n\nSir,\n\nA third time an information reached me that the Indian day school at Saddle Lake, N.W.T. had been closed by the discretion of the Agent or Inspector, on the ground, I believe, of the very small attendance. It appears that subsequently the teacher there, Mr. Leonard, re-opened the school on his own authority, but at the request of various parties in the neighborhood, and has been carrying it on since then. He expressed the opinion that the small attendance was due largely to the location of the school, which was not convenient for many of the Protestant Indians on the Reserve, and recommended that another site be selected, if possible, some distance away. Since then, as I am informed, the Reserve was visited by the Rev. John McDougall, Superintendent of Northern Indian Missions in the North-West, and after consultation the Indians agreed to set aside a certain portion of land for the use of the Mission, so long as the Missionary Society continued its work at that point. I presume that this matter has been brought to the notice of the Department before this time, but I write now respecting two points: First, That I think it very desirable that a school should be maintained at Saddle Lake, and the customary grant be made by the Department for the purpose; and Second, That it is very desirable that when any changes are proposed respecting schools\nthat have been carried on under the auspices of the Methodist Church, that I should be informed at the time of what is proposed. I find that in some cases important changes are made by the Indian Agent, either independently or in consultation with the missionary, so by instruction of the Superintendent, or when I have no information, and some times even without the slightest advice I know what has been done\u2014without even that the information reached me in time to instruct you.\n\nIt is in the wish of the Superintendent that, in regard to matters in his jurisdiction, that he should communicate with the Indian Commissioner. As trustees we will willingly do our best to do very desirable work in this way we should be happy to receive any advice or any proposed changes.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I beg to submit the following report:\n\nThere are eleven (II) children of school age\nbelonging to the Methodist Mission, residing on the\nSaddle Lake portion of the reserve. Six of these\nchildren live within a reasonable distance from the\nschool house, and one of these a boy of unsound mind,\nBelow is a list of all the children.\n\nBlue Quill, has one boy seven and a half years\nof age, and lives only a short distance from the\nschool.\n\nNahyawhatatic, has one girl 10\u00bd years, and\none boy 7 years old, the family live within a rea-\nsonable distance from the school, but the children\nwere very irregular attendance in the past.\n\nMatook, has a boy 13 years old but of unsound\nmind.\n\nSam Steinhauer, has one girl 7\u00bd years old, they\nlive about three miles from the school, too far to\nattend regularly.\n\nAugustine Steinhauer, has a little girl of eight\nyears old, they live considerable distance from the\nschool. Steinhauer informs me that he intends to\nsend this child to Whitefish Lake to school.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\n\nCharles\n\nWinnipeg, Man.\nCharles Jackson, has a boy 12 years old and a girl 10 years, they live about three miles from the school, and would therefore be irregular attendants.\n\nJames Cardinal, lives within a reasonable distance from the school, and has a girl of six and a half years old.\n\nLouis Cardinal, lives within a reasonable distance from the school, and has two boys, one 12 years the other 5 years old but he will not promise to send the children to school regularly.\n\nI herewith attach a rough sketch showing where the Indian houses are located on Saddle Lake, and the distance from the school. I do not consider that if the school house were removed to a new location that it would be any better. There are now four families with children of school age living in the vicinity of the school house.\n\nThe attendance always dwindles down during the summer months, on account of the Indians camping out at their hay fields, and taking the children with them. There are some of them of course who are very indifferent as to sending their children to school.\n\nI cannot say that the Indians have any objection to the school.\n\nThe present Teacher, Mr. C. W. Leonard, is not well liked by the Indians, caused chiefly through his transactions with them, over which there has been differences, and there were two families who refused to send their children to school on this account, in the past. The Indians claim that the Teacher's disposition towards them is not a pleasant one, with other remarks that reflect no credit upon him.\nI also consider that the Teacher has not shown a disposition to encourage the children attend school, he maintained that his part of the work was merely to be on hand and teach the children when they came to school. His overbearing manner has not a good effect upon them.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obt. servt.\n\n(sgd.) Geo.G.Mann\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant re the Saddle Lake Day School and to enclose a copy of a letter from the Indian Agent and a plan of the reserve with Indian houses, the whole speaking for itself. I hardly think it worth while to keep the school open, but beg to leave the matter to the decision of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 11th March, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nThe Indian Commissioner, who was asked for a report on Dr Sutherland's application for the reopening of the day school at Saddle Lake, writes that he hardly thinks it would be worth while to keep the school open, and in confirmation of his opinion he encloses a copy of a letter from Mr Agent Hann, who forwards a sketch showing the location of the Indians' houses on Saddle Lake from which it would appear that only a few of the 11 Methodist children of school age on the reserve could possibly be regular attendants at the school owing to the distance they would have to go; and even if the school were removed to a new location, matters would not be improved.\n\nIn addition to this the Agent says that the teacher whom Dr Sutherland wishes to have recognized is not liked by the Indians, and he considers him unsuitable for the work, owing to his overbearing manner.\n\nIn view of the foregoing I do not think that the Department would be justified in recognizing the school, and Dr Sutherland might be advised of the situation.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOTTAWA, 15th March, 1904\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 6th January last regarding the closing of the Saddle Lake school, I beg to say that as a result of the enquiries made, the Department considers that it would not be justified in again re-opening this school as there are only a very limited number of children of school age on the reserve who could possibly be regular attendants owing to the distance they would have to go, and even if the school were removed to a new site matters would not be improved. The Department has been furnished with a sketch showing the location of the Indians houses at Saddle Lake which bears out the above statement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nRev.

Sir,\n\nReferring to our conversation of the other day, I beg to repeat what I then said, viz., that the suggestion of closing the school at Saddle Lake was the outcome of the failure in attendance. In addition to the causes which ordinarily operate against the regular attendance of Indian pupils at Day Schools, there was in this case I fear a cause created by the teacher who, from the information that I have, displayed rather a faculty for creating antagonism than the tact so essential in dealing with Indians. On the understanding that you will name a substitute for Mr. Leonard, who in your opinion will be well fitted for the position of teacher, the school will be kept open until we can judge from the results under the new man whether they will warrant its continuance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Frank Oliver,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSome two years ago\nthe Indian Dept. closed the Saddle\nLake day school. It will readily sug-\ngest itself to you who was the mover in\nthis matter and to show that it was\na somewhat personal matter I refer\nyou to the a communication addressed\nto Rev. Mr. McDougall over the signature\nof Mr. McKenna, Ass't Sec., Com.,\nWinnipeg. He says \"remove the man\nand we shall reopen the school.\"\nI have never had anything to do\nwith Mr. McKenna and of course\nhis source of information is the\nInd. Agent at Saddle Lake.\n\nThe Church did not \"remove\nthe man\" who is myself and I\ndo not think you can hope so\nserious objection to my occupying\nthe position nor any other of our\nparty adherents and supporters.\nSteps are being taken to re-\nopen the school and I am writing\nso that you will be behind the scenes\nin the matter.\n\nMy school at the Mississaugas\nconsisted of\nMr. Beatty's children 6\n\" Tomlinson \" 1\n\" Whitfield \" 6\n\" Carroll \" 1\n\nTotal 14, besides the\nIndian children. Their attendance was\nirregular I admit and the closing of the\nschool was not illegal but it was I believe\nunjust under the circumstances. There\nwere as all as you know Govt. officials\nremoved from any public school and\nthe closing of the school is felt to be a grievance\nand to be done in a vindictive spirit.\nPlease for your favorable consideration when this\nmatter comes up. Yours respectfully\n[Signature] Donald\nChas. M. Leonard, Saddle Lake, \nwrits regarding re-opening of \nSaddle Lake School. When it \nwas closed 2 years ago there were \n12 besides Indian children at-\ntending & the closing of school \nwas felt to be a grievance, as \nchildren were removed from \npublic schools.\n\nAsks favorable con-\nsideration when matter \ncomes before Council.\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to Mr Leonard's letter regarding the closing of the Saddle Lake school, I beg to say that this school was closed on the 30th June 1903 by direction of the Indian Commissioner with the consent of the Department, on account of the very unsatisfactory attendance of Indian pupils, the average for that year having fallen to 4, and for the last quarter it did not reach two. Rev. Dr Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, wrote the Department regarding the closing of this school and the Indian Commissioner was asked for a report on the subject. He expressed the opinion that it did not seem worth while to keep the school open and enclosed a copy of a letter from Agent Mann regarding this school, from which it appears that there were only 11 children of school age belonging to the Methodists residing on the Saddle Lake portion of the reserve. Only 6 of these children live within a reasonable distance of the school and one of them (a boy) was of unsound mind. A sketch accompanied Mr Mann's letter showing the location of the Indians houses around Saddle Lake and the situation of the schoolhouse, which proved his contention that most of the Indians live too far from the school for their children to attend, and it would not seem possible to place the schoolhouse in a more favorable situation.\nThe Agent in his report did say that the teacher, Mr Leonard was not well liked by the Indians caused chiefly through his transactions with them, over which there were differences and that two families had refused to send their children to school on this account. The Indians claimed that the teacher's disposition towards them was not a pleasant one, with other remarks which reflected no credit upon him.\n\nThe Agent was of the opinion that the teacher had shown a disposition to encourage the children to attend school, maintaining that his part of the work was merely to be on hand and teach the children when they came to school. The Agent concluded by stating that the teacher's over-bearing manner had not a good effect upon the Indians.\n\nIn March 1904 Dr Sutherland was advised that as a result of the enquiries made, the Department considered that it would not be justified in again reopening this school, as there were only a very limited number of children of school age on the reserve who could possibly be regular attendants, owing to the distance they would have to go, and that even if the school were removed to a new site, matters would not be improved.\n\nAfter the school was closed in 1903, Mr Leonard re-opened it on his own authority at the request of various parties in the neighborhood, and in Jan. 1904 when the Department was advised of his action by Dr Sutherland, he was carrying it on, and may still be continuing it.\n\nIn June 1904 the Asst. Commissioner forwarded a copy of a letter addressed by him to Rev. John McDougall, Supt. of Indian missions in the N.W.T., who\nhad visited the reserve after the closing of the school. A copy of Mr McKenna's letter to Mr McDougall is turned out on file herewith, from which you will see that he suggested to McDougall the naming of a substitute for Mr Leonard, when the school would be kept open until it could be learned from the results under the new man, whether they would warrant its continuance. Up to the present time the school has not been officially re-opened and the Department is not aware of what steps have been taken to have this done.\n\nIt is no doubt a hardship to the officials not to have a school for their children, but the Department is not supposed to conduct one for this purpose. The small attendance was sufficient cause for the closing of the school, and the Agent's report as to the unpopularity of the teacher would justify the Department in asking for a change if the school were to be re-opened.\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nReferring to the Deputy Minister's letter of the 15th January 1904, in regard to the Day School at Saddle Lake, conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church, which was closed for an insufficient attendance of pupils, I beg to say that recently I have had correspondence with Rev. Dr. Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Church, and Rev. A. R. Albridge, Chairman of the Vermilion River Methodist District, and they assure me that since the school was closed, a considerable number of children on the reserve have become of school age, and that Mr. C. W. Leonard, whom the said Chairman placed in charge of the school during the summer, has had an attendance at times of 24 pupils.\n\nUnder these circumstances I am prepared to recognize the said Mr. Leonard as Teacher of the school while his services are satisfactory, from the 1st. of October, the beginning of the present quarter, providing the Department can find funds to pay the usual teacher's salary for the balance of the present financial year, for which no item was placed in the current year's estimates. I will re-enter the item in the estimates for the next fiscal year, now in course of preparation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, 9th November, 1905.\n\nMemorandum:-\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nWith reference to the question of re-opening the Saddle Lake School I beg to say that a communication has been received from the Indian Commissioner, in reply to letter addressed to him by you, in which he recommends that this School should be recognized from the 1st October last, the beginning of the present quarter, under the management of Mr. Leonard as teacher.\n\nThe Accountant informs me that funds can be found to pay him the salary although the School is not included in the estimates, and, under the circumstances, I would suggest that it be given a trial.\nOttawa, November 14, 1905.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd inst., with further reference to the reorganisation of the Saddle Lake school, and in reply I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation, the Department will sanction the opening of the school from October 1st, under the management of Mr. Leonard as teacher.\n\nThe continuance of this school is dependent on its being conducted in a satisfactory manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nSecretary.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nSaskatoon, Sask.\nSaddle Lake, June 14th.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nToronto.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is a very rare thing for me to write a letter of complaint. I am under obligation to do so now however. It is re the attitude of the Indian Agent to our school work here. We have put up with almost everything up to the present calculated to discourage us in our school work. We have come to the place now where silence ceases to be golden.\n\nLet me go back in my story so as to give you an idea of the situation. When Mrs Seller took charge of the school two years ago it was soon quite noticeable that Mr. Batty did not take any interest in the work of the school. When fall came on with some persuasion we succeeded in getting the school in good shape for the winter. That was the fall of 1907. So far there had been nothing to complain of. The winter of that year saw a great deal of hardship in procuring wood and getting it cut up for the school. I provided a good deal of the wood myself and day after day went to the school and cut up wood necessary for the day. I did not do this, however, without approaching Mr. Batty over and over again about it. I got tired of that. So I thought I would try a new plan and made an arrangement with the Agent that I should hire the Indians to bring wood to the school and cut it and send the bill to him. This I have done ever since and the wood problem has been fairly well solved, giving me, however, work which belongs to the Agent.\n\nMatters moved along fairly well then until the fall of '08, when time came to have the old log school fitted up for the winter. I requested Mr. Batty to get the school mudded for us. He gave me no assurance that he would do it and at last\nput me off by saying \"That is not my business; that is the work of the Farm Instructor; go to him about it.\" The Farm Instructor did not think it was his duty, and so the old school went unmudded. When the cold winter came we found that it would be impossible to hold school there, and rather than close school altogether we opened our home for a school and took the children into our own home. You can imagine how inconvenient that was for us.\n\nThen we fitted up the old kitchen into a school. Happily I had had it mudded before the winter set in. That is where school is being held yet.\n\nNow I took all this which I have related in the best of good nature. I did not complain or say an impatient word even to Mr. Batty. I am writing this letter to you now because I have heard from the office here that Mr. Batty is using his influence with the Department to have the school closed altogether; and why, I do not know.\n\nOf course there is a very small attendance. I have it to say though, and without the least reservation, that if the Indian Agent here took the least interest at all in the school it would be an easy matter to get a larger attendance. Possibly you know that it is the duty of the Agent to visit the Indian schools once each month and send in to the Department a very detailed report of his visit to the school. Well you will be amazed to learn, and the Dept. through you, I trust, that he did not pay even one official visit to the school since Mrs Seller took charge of it two years ago. Notwithstanding this he has sent in a full report of a visit each month.\n\nYou have no doubt read that pamphlet entitled, \"Regulations relating to the education of Indian children,\" printed in 1908, containing the recent Act of our Government re this matter. We believe this to be a valuable aid to us in our work if - if - we had an Agent who would show the least inclination to do the part\nassigned him in this pamphlet. Before I had a copy in my possession I went to him and asked him if he had not power given him to see that Indian children attended school. He said he knew of nothing of any such regulation as I mentioned. I had at the same time positive proof that he had read them and discussed them with others. I told him that I had read the Act, and then he modified what he had said by stating that the Department did not desire him to put that into force.\n\nNow we have a Methodist family within the two mile area who will not send their children to school. The father has turned out to be a sort of medicine man, and does not want to send his children to school. This is the family I had in mind when, during the last few months, I have gone to the Agent to secure his assistance. I do not think that any drastic measures would have to be used in getting these children to school if the Agent would only take up the matter with them and show them what the law requires.\n\nWe look upon our school work here as the most hopeful side of our work if only we could secure the attendance of our Indian children. So far as I can see there is no reason why we should not have an average of 18 or 20 children attending school. My own mind in the matter is, if the Indian Department would only build a good school in a more central part of the protestant portion of this Reserve, and if teams were sent round every morning to the doors of the homes where children are, and these teams took the children back again in the evening, that at least 20 children could be at school every day. A compulsory Act under such a system would then be workable and might be put into force without much friction. Of course it would cost a little more, but would it not be wise to spend a little more and get some results? The inefficiency of our school work at this point has cost us more heartache than any other thing. What will become of our work here\nif this problem is not more efficiently solved? I know of several children whom we will lose if we do not do something right away.\n\nI am writing this letter to you, dear Doctor Sutherland, to ask you to take up this matter with the Department and see that this school is not closed here. This letter is not written in a few minutes of \"the blues\", (that's a trouble I know very little about) It is written after a great deal of deliberation. I want your counsel in this matter, also your influence to see that the Agent is made do his duty in regard to school work. I have not written any complaints to the I.D. This is the first I have written or said outside about the matter.\n\nTrusting that I may hear from you soon re this matter of most vital importance to our work here.\n\nI am,\n\nYours fraternaly,\n(Signed) J. A. Seller.\nSuperintendent General, Indian Affairs.\n\ning properly located, and I trust that this will have the favorable consideration of the Superintendent General. A neat and comfortable church has recently been erected, and a dwelling for the missionary is now in process of erection. If to this were added a comfortable and properly equipped school house, there would be all necessary appliances for doing good work, but to make the school a success under present conditions is simply an impossibility.\n\nIn regard to the Agent, I can only say that I know Mr. Seller to be careful in his statements and I am convinced he would not have formulated the complaint has he not felt that this was the only resort.\n\nHoping for a favorable reply, I have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Sutherland\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnclosure.\nSir,-\n\nI have the honor to enclose copy of a letter recently received from the Rev. J.A.Seller, B.A., missionary to the Indians at Saddle Lake, Alberta, referring to the condition of school work on that Reserve and the attitude of the Indian Agent in relation thereto. I have no information beyond what is contained in the letter referred to, but I can underwrite Mr. Seller as a man who is not only very careful in his statements, but is courteous and considerate in his intercourse with other people, and I know that his desire is to maintain the most friendly relations with the Agent of the Government on the Reserve where he is stationed. I am aware that the attendance at the Protestant school at Saddle Lake has been and still is small, but in view of the dilapidated and uncomfortable condition of the school house and its inconvenient location, and the indifference, not to use a stronger term, of the Agent, one only wonders that any children can be induced to attend. We have been informed that it is the policy of the Superintendent General to endeavor to improve the character of the Indian Day Schools, and it appears to me that Saddle Lake affords an excellent opportunity of trying the experiment. With some eighteen or twenty Protestant children of school age on the Reserve I feel convinced that a fairly good attendance could be secured if there was a suitable build-\nSuperintendent General, Indian Affairs.\n\ning properly located, and I trust that this will have the favorable consideration of the Superintendent General.

J. A. Seller, I have to inform you that Mr. Inspr. Markle has been instructed to enquire fully into the condition of day school work on the Saddle Lake Reserve and make recommendations which will effect what seems to be a needed change. Mr. Markle will consult with the Rev. J. A. Seller and the Indian Agent with reference to the location of a new school building and the adoption of some means for increasing the attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, Esq., D.D.,\nSecretary Methodist Missionary Society,\nTORONTO.\nOttawa, July 6th., 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nThe attention of the Department having been drawn to the necessity of improving the day school building on the Saddle Lake Reserve, I have to request that when you next proceed to that Agency you will enquire carefully into the conditions which exist on the Reserve with reference to the Day School. It is desired that this School should be operated under more favorable conditions and the Department will be prepared to erect a new and improved building at a central location. Means will also be adopted to increase the attendance. In due course arrangements could be carried out for the provision of a simple but nourishing mid-day meal, and if necessary, at certain seasons of the year arrangements might be made to transport the pupils who reside at a distance to and from the school. You should consult with the Agent and the Rev. Mr. Seller upon these matters and point out that the Department desires to increase the usefulness of this day school and that the Agent will be expected to use his influence with the Indians and to take a personal interest in the work of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. A. Markle, Esq.,\nInspr. of Indian Agencies,\nRed Deer, Alta.\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, 7th July, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nYour letter of the 30th ultimo was received here via Winnipeg, on the 5th instant. In writing to me hereafter please address at Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, as the Indian Commissioner's Office at Winnipeg has been closed and I have been transferred to headquarters.\n\nIn regard to the Protestant School at Saddle Lake, taught by Mrs. Seller, the Department will take into consideration whether or not it may be advisable to erect a new school-house at an early date.\n\nA year or two ago your Mission at Saddle Lake obtained leave to occupy ten acres of land near the lake on which to build a Church and Mission House. Have these been erected? Because if they have not it will be premature to place a new school-house adjoining that site. If Mrs. Seller continues teacher of the school she will require to live nearby.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Dr. Sutherland,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto, Ont.\nThe Methodist Church,\nMISSIONARY DEPARTMENT,\n\nDictated - Dr. S. Toronto, July 8th, 1909.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant intimating that the Indian Commissioner's office at Winnipeg has been closed and that you have been transferred to head-quarters.\n\nIn regard to Saddle Lake I would say that a neat and commodious church has been erected on the new site near the Lake, which was set apart for mission purposes a year or two ago. A new mission house is now in process of erection near the church, and it is very desirable that a school house be erected in the same locality.\n\nI am informed by the Secretary of the Department that Mr. Inspector Markle has been instructed to enquire fully into the condition of the Day School work at Saddle Lake, and when his report is received I trust that the way may be open to provide the necessary school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nHon. D. Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMr. C. T. Scott\n\nI request you will take these letters be placed on the desk in my office at the Lake Protestant School. You will note that there is a house near the school house which has been used for the purpose of housing the new school. I request you to unite with me.\n\nD. L.\nSir,\n\nSome weeks ago I received a letter from you asking for information re. the day school on this reserve and I overlooked bringing the referral to letter with me, therefore unable to refer to it and to reply to all the questions contained therein. On my return to my office I shall endeavor to reply to the unanswered portions and now to hand you herewith a sketch of a portion of the reserve together with the ages of the children and the approximate distances they now reside from the old school building.\n\nI learn since I arrived here that Mrs. Apow has taken charge of the school and operating it in the old mission building and where she has taken up residence. The old mission building is located about \u00bd mile nearer to the homes of several of the children than the old school building.\n\nI was under the impression that there were double, at least, the number of children of school age and protestant faith on this reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInsp.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 28, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th inst., with reference to the day school on the Saddle Lake reserve, and in reply I beg to say that the Department will await the further information referred to therein before taking any action.\n\nI may add that, in view of the small number of pupils of the Protestant faith on this reserve, the Department is not disposed to incur any large expenditure in connection with the erection of a new school building, but will give the matter careful consideration.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.

Left agency too suddenly to secure full information. This I intended to do if had not been called away. The Agent is in a position to advise you fully.\nSir,\n\nIf you turn to my letter of the 6th ultimo you will observe that I referred to a letter from you and which I stated I neglected to take with me to Saddle Lake. Since I returned here I tried to locate the letter referred to and I have so far failed, I may locate later but for fear I do not I shall thank you for a copy - letter referring to the day school. I may say, however, that I failed to visit the place on this visit, having been called away by the Minister, but I know that the old log walled building that has been in use for a number of years is neither fit for use or worth expending any money on. It is not an easy matter to locate a new site and that site be central and for the reason that the lake obstructs direct ways to a site and, moreover, Indians change locations and what now might be a central location might not be next year. If the Indians surrendered some of their land and started to farm on the lines I have indicated in the proposition I made to them, copy forwarded, the location of many homes would be changed. If they surrender and receive a handsome sum in cash I prefer not to be asked for a prediction as to where they may settle down. Near where the new Church is located, west end of the lake, seems now to be about the best point for a new school building, if one is to be erected.\n\nSince I wrote letter of the 6th ultimo Louise and Thomas Wahonanow have gone to the Onion Lake boarding school and this reduces the number of children within the reserve by 2.

The attendance varies from - to about 5, so I was informed, I asked about what it would cost to hire a conveyance to bring the children to the school and to return them to their homes after the school was closed and the reply was that possibly some one would undertake the work for about $3.00 per day. I learned at this late visit that the Indians of Saddle Lake and White Fish Lake are great believers of freedom of action and view any restraint as very galling and humiliating. If provision was made to deliver their children at the school and return them to their homes they would look upon it as another stroke at their rights. The Chief at White Fish, Pakan, stated: \"Do not app- \"riate any of the help his band is now receiving from the \"Department and that he would be glad if all officials removed \"therefrom, including the bulla placed there by the Department. He afterwards stated that he had little grounds for complain- ing personally, that the sack of flour and 30 lbs. of bacon he received monthly was very good but he would like to get del- ivery of it at White Fish Red rye and not be compelled to go to the agency for it. He was reminded that the change was made, re-delivery, at his own request. Many at Saddle Lake entertain \"the freedom of action\" idea, too.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNote. As you know I receive mail at many points and office is partially a moving one. This is a small excuse for mislaying the letter refer- red to above.\n\nJ.A.M.\nEx'd\n\nOttawa, November 4th, 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn connection with previous correspondence in reference to the Saddle Lake Day School and the need of a new building there I beg to say that, while the report of the Department's Inspector in regard to this school shows that the old building is unfit for use and not worth repairing, the Department is not satisfied that it would at present be justified in going to the expense of erecting a new building on the site proposed by you, or in fact anywhere on the Reserve, as it is doubtful where the Indians will permanently locate.\n\nThe attendance is small and uncertain and the cost of hiring a conveyance to bring the children to school would be an excessive charge owing to the situation of the Indians' habitations! I am enclosing a rough sketch showing where the Indians are located, with a list of the locators, the number of children in each family of school age and the distance they reside from the school. The Inspector further states that these Indians do not appreciate anything the Department is doing for them, and would strongly object to any compulsion in regard to the education of their children. Even if provision were made to take the children to and from school they would look at it as another strike at their rights.\n\nIn view of the unsatisfactory condition of\n\nRev. Dr. Sutherland,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\naffairs on this Reserve the Department considers that it would be premature to take up the question of erecting a new school building. In the meantime, however, the Department would be glad to give consideration to any suggestions for improving the conditions and assisting the teacher under the present arrangement of holding the school in the old mission building, if those engaged in the work have any to offer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nsecretary.\nOttawa, November 2nd, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st ultimo asking for a copy of letter sent you on July 6th, last, and in reply I beg to enclose you copy of letter referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nsecretary.\n\nJ. A. Markle, Esq.,\nInspr. of Indian Agencies,\nRed Deer, Alta.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Saddle Lake Indian School.\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th inst., #117060, referring to the Indian School at Saddle Lake. It is conceded that the old school building is unfit for use and not worth repairing, but the Department thinks it would not be justified in going to the expense of erecting a new building on the site we have suggested, or, indeed, anywhere on the reserve, as it is doubtful where the Indians will permanently locate.\n\nThere are features of this question which I find it difficult to understand. In interviews and correspondence with the Department we have been given distinctly to understand that the Minister was entirely in favor of improving the character and work of Indian Day Schools, rather than provide additional Boarding Schools or Institutes. Although we were not very sanguine as to the results of Day School work, yet we were willing to support the Minister in this policy and give it a fair trial. With a view to bringing about a more satisfactory state of things on the Saddle Lake Reserve, we stationed a very able and conscientious man at that point, whose wife is thoroughly competent as a teacher, provided another could not be secured. To further encourage the Indians, we aided them in the erection of a new Church on a new site much more convenient than the old one. We also have erected, this Summer, a dwelling for the Missionary, and are doing everything to show the Indians that this is a permanent location, and we wish to encourage them in settling on the most convenient part of the reserve. The school we considered a necessity in carrying out the general plan,\nalthough we would have preferred a Boarding School for the Saddle Lake, White Fish Lake, and Good Fish Lake Indians, had such a plan been favored by the Minister. To have the plan of the Day School blocked at this stage is not only disappointing in itself, but has another very serious aspect, namely, that it is the very thing which encourages, or almost compels, Indians, if they desire their children to be educated at all, to send them to some of the existing Boarding Schools, and as no Protestant Boarding School is within reach the alternative is very plain. Like Indians everywhere, those at Saddle Lake may not be much interested in education for their children, but, with proper facilities provided, and the influence of a man like the Rev. Mr. Seller, I feel convinced that in course of time, and not very long time at that, the greater part of the children would be gathered into the school, and if some expense would be incurred in bringing in those who live at a distance it would be a very wise expenditure in view of possible results. Knowing that a new dwelling for the Indian Agent had been erected, we were confirmed in the impression that Saddle Lake was to be continued as a centre, and it seems to me that Saddle Lake is one of the very places where the new policy of the Department respecting Day Schools should have a fair trial.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, Nov. 13th., 1909.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of Nov. 5th on the subject of the Saddle Lake Indian Day School, I beg to say that the policy of the Department with reference to the promotion of day school work has not in any way been altered, nor is the erection of a day school at Saddle Lake positively refused by the letter of the 4th. of November. It is simply thought to be premature to immediately order the erection of the building when the hope of success seems somewhat questionable. You were placed in possession of the facts as they appeared to one of our Inspectors and you were asked for suggestions, if any could be offered by those engaged in the work. It was thought that the success of the missionary work under the new auspices might be taken as an index of what measure of success could be expected in the educational field. I am bound to say that your remark that a school is considered a necessity in carrying out the general plan would influence the Department to erect the new buildings.\n\nThe enclosures in letter of the 4th. of November show that there are only thirteen Indian children and two non-treaty children on the Reserve. Notwithstanding that there is no boarding school on the Reserve or in the immediate vicinity you will observe that eight children are now attending the Church of England Boarding School at Onion Lake and five are in the Industrial School at Red Deer. Of the 13 children of pure Indian blood now on the Reserve, Mr. Markle stated that two, Louise and Thomas Wahatanow went to the Onion Lake School on the 22nd. of September and that there was a likelihood of two children\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary Meth. Missionary Society,\nTORONTO.\nof Dan Makokis also going to this school. That would still further reduce the available number, and our Inspector's statements cannot be reconciled with the statements made in the Rev. Mr. Seller's letter to you of the 14th of June last in which he stated that there should be an average of from 18 to 20 children attending school. The Inspector also stated that he understood it would probably cost $3.00 a day to transport the children to and from school; which would be more than the Department could undertake to pay for that service.\n\nAs it will be impossible to erect any building during the winter there will be time for you to correspond with Mr. Seller and obtain an extended report from him. If you will kindly do so, the Department will further consider the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nI was at the Saddle Lake Agency during the greater portion of the month of September and I intended to take a visit to the day school before leaving but was called away hastily by the Superintendent General and failed to visit this institution.\n\n1. From what I gathered, however, I did not mind much. The attendance at best was 4 or 5 and they only attended now and again. Moreover, the Rev. Mr. Macdonald of the Onion Lake boarding school had visited the reserve and arranged for the transfer of several of the pupils to the Onion Lake school.\n\n2. While at the agency I made up a map of the reserve and on it showed the location of the homes of the children of school age. From it I concluded that it would be no easy task to get a regular attendance at a day school within this reserve - locate it at any point.\n\n3. This school is under the auspices of the Methodist Church and with Mrs. Ayer as the teacher. I do not think Mrs. Ayer holds any standard of a teachers certificate.\n\n4. The old school building was abandoned some months before and Mrs. Ayer was occupying the old mission house and teaching, when any children to teach, in one of the unoccupied rooms of this mission house. It is about\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nas central a location for a school as there is on the reserve but the pupils are too few and their homes at too great a distance from any point to ensure a regular attendance, particularly when neither the parents or the children care whether school keeps or not.\n\n6. The Methodist denomination at one time held a good grasp on the Indians of the Saddle Lake and White Fish Lake reserves. Apparently they have lost this grip by trying to operate three day schools, and an industrial at a long distance away from the recruiting grounds, against a very well managed and aggressive boarding school operated under another denomination and right on the ground. The result is exactly what might have been foreseen years ago.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nThe Methodist Church,\nMISSIONARY DEPARTMENT.\n\nDictated - Dr. S.\n\nToronto, November 20th, 1909.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPermit me to thank you for your letter of November 12th, No. 117,060, referring to the Indian Day School at Saddle Lake. This letter puts me in possession of some local circumstances of which I was not previously aware. I may say also, that information contained in a letter from another official of the Department gave me some insight into the attitude of the Indians, or some of them, toward the Government and its agent, which leaves it uncertain if they would cordially co-operate in school matters even if a suitable building were provided. The Indians had co-operated so heartily in the erection of a new church that it left me under the impression they would be equally cordial in the matter of a school. I will write at once to the missionary in charge, and if he can give me any information that will supplement that already received by the Department I will communicate it to you without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSaddle Lake, January 5, 1910.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nToronto.\n\nDear Brother,\n\nI am writing this letter at your request to offer some suggestions re the education of the Indian children at Saddle Lake.\n\nIn the first place permit me to say that I greatly appreciate the opportunity of laying this matter before you and through you approaching the Department of Indian Affairs, re this matter.\n\nI was not a little surprised to learn that the official report of Inspector Markle as to the number of Protestant children at Saddle Lake is so far from being a true statement of the situation as I find it. I judge that the best way to convince you of the incorrectness of his report in this particular is to give you a list of the Protestant children with their ages and the names of father or guardian.\n\nThe list is as follows:\n\n| Name of child          | Age | Parent or Guardian |\n|------------------------|-----|--------------------|\n| Louise Quinney         | 9   | Angus Quinney      |\n| Zacharias Cardinal     | 10  | James Cardinal     |\n| Mary Cardinal          | 12  |                    |\n| William Cardinal       | 6   |                    |\n| Jessie Steinheuer      | 14  | Sam Steinheuer     |\n| John Steinheuer        | 12  |                    |\n| Roy Steinheuer         | 10  |                    |\n| Marie Steinheuer       | 6   |                    |\n| Albert Neyawetatik     | 15  | Jane Neyawetatik   |\n| James Neyawetatik      | 12  |                    |\n| Marjory Steinheuer     | 10  | Mrs. Henry Steinheuer, Sr. |\n| Evangeline             | 11  | Arthur Steinheuer  |\n| Solomon Steinheuer     | 7   |                    |\n| Edward Stone           | 6   | Mrs. Angelina Apow |\n| Lloyd Cardinal         | 10  | Louis Cardinal Dr. |\n| Jones Cardinal         | 14  | Louis Cardinal, Sr.|\n| Charlotte Wasatanow    | 10  | Simon Wasatanow    |\n| Thomas Wasatanow       | 12  | Simon Wasatanow    |\n| Louise Wasatanow       | 12  | Simon Wasatanow    |\n| Nora Lakokis           | 10  | Daniel Lakokis    |\n| Clara Lakokis          | 6   |                    |\n| Mahokis                | 6   |                    |\nAll the children on this list are Treaty Indian children and Protestants. Four of them, two of Simon Wasatanow's and two of Daniel Makokis' have gone to Onion Lake since I sent you my previous reckoning. This means that eighteen Treaty Indian children are still with us.\n\nWhen I wrote you that letter containing the reckoning of the number of school children here I included the children of a family not entitled to Treaty because they have taken up a homestead just outside of the Reserve. I hardly understand why such children should be discriminated against. Ought they not rather to be favored because of the very fact that the father has given up Treaty rights and stepped out for himself? There are three children in this family and they reside nearer than a number of Treaty children. I included them in my former estimate of the children it would be possible to convey to and from school and thus educate them. Then there are two or three other not Protestant children from whose parents I have secured promises of attendance at school if a team conveyed them to and from the school. In each case these children are several miles from school.\n\nThe point of importance before us in this regard however, is this: That eighteen Treaty Indian children are still with us, that this is correct and that the report of the Inspector is not correct. When the report of the Inspector was sent in, moreover, the two children of Daniel Makokis had not gone to Onion Lake. His report should have been\ntwenty (20) and not thirteen (13).\n\nI have great respect for Inspector Markle and a high opinion of his judgment but he receives his information from the agent here and that is why it is incorrect. I am quite sure that the Inspector is not in any way prejudiced against our interests and that he has no idea that his report is an incorrect one.\n\nI am asked for suggestions re the problem here. In reply I may say that I do not think I can do anything more than I have already done to increase the attendance at school. Of the eighteen children here not more than ten are within two miles and a half from the school.\n\nOne of the things that makes it hard to conduct day-school is the lack of respect on the part of the Indians for our day school. I do not wonder at this.\n\nThe school house that has to be abandoned on December of 1908 was a disgrace to the place, and now that the school meets in a dingy, dark, old kitchen of a ready-to-be-abandoned mission-house with no spot in which to hang a map, two small windows which some days let in scarcely enough light to enable the children to read and desks so huddled around as to make it difficult to draw up a class into line, the situation is scarcely improved.\n\nNow when you add to this the facts I disclosed in my last letter re this matter, as to the way the Agent at this point has treated this school (I ask) can you wonder that the Indian has lost respect for our\nday school? How can a teacher, missionary or anyone else, be expected to do much to improve the situation under present conditions?\n\nI have only one suggestion to offer and it is this: That the problem of the education of children here and at Goodfish and Whitefish Lakes can be best solved by erecting a boarding school. The day school will never begin to work out this problem. This is seen plainly when you consider the following facts:\n\n1. Only ten out of the eighteen children mentioned above are near enough to attend school and four of them are between two miles and two and a half miles away.\n\n2. There ten children come from four families. Now if two of these families happen to be away for two or three months of the school year (as is often the case), not these two families are inevitably those with the largest number of scholars (namely Sam Steinhauser and James Cardinal), there are very few children left to attend school.\n\n3. The fact that these eighteen children are scattered over an area whose radius, taking the old mission house as a centre, is eight miles.\n\nIf these children were conveyed to and from school, the problem might be partially solved but probably this method would be too expensive for returns realized. This method would not meet the difficulty outlined above in 2.\n\nThe erection of a Boarding School here or between here and Goodfish Lake, sufficient to accommodate all the children on Brother Steinhauser's Mission and on my own, will be the first move in my humble opinion, toward the most successful working out of the situation in this work which we represent. I may emphatically state that I have no personal interest in recommending a\nBoarding School here for I have no ambition in this direction and am penning these words with only one feeling that of an intense longing for the education of our Indian boys and girls. I feel sure that if the Red Deer Industrial Institute were within fifty miles of this Reserve the children now drifting from us into the Onion Lake School would be attending our own Institution. We would much rather have them attend the school at Onion Lake than have them drift into the R.C. Boarding School but why should not the Methodist Church be training her own Indian boys and girls?\n\nI humbly submit to you the result of my findings as a missionary of two years and a half among the Indians here and trust that my letter is sufficiently plain to be readily understood.\n\nYours fraternaly,\n\n(Signed) J.A.Seller.\nDictated - Dr. S.

Seller for additional information, and have just received his reply, a copy of which I enclose for your information. From this you will see that the number of Protestant children on Saddle Lake Reserve is larger than was mentioned in the Inspector's Report. That, however does not solve the question of attendance at school, but Mr. Seller makes further suggestions which may be worthy of consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C.

Sir,\n\nThe Department has just received the resignation of Mrs. Steinhauer, teacher of the Saddle Lake day school, to take effect on the 31st instant. This resignation has been accepted.\n\nIn this connection I may say that the Department does not think it advisable to continue this school in operation. The attendance has been very poor lately; the last three quarters showing averages of 4.8, 3.1 and 4.9 respectively. There are on this reserve in all only 27 children of school age, 12 of whom are situated so that they might be able to attend the day school. There are at present enrolled at the Red Deer Industrial School twelve and at the Blue Quills Boarding School five. In view of the above the Department considers that it would be advisable for the Missionary and others interested to put forth special efforts to have as many of the remaining Protestant children as possible enrolled at Red Deer and should this effort meet with success there will be no necessity at the present time for the day school. I trust that this suggestion will meet with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T.

There are now more children within three miles of the site occupied by the Methodist mission than there were within the same distance of the old school where school was formerly held.\n\nOur purpose now is to make trial of a school in the Methodist mission house for the month of October and if there is sufficient encouragement to warrant it to then (in October) make application\nTo the Department of the Indian Affairs to open the school for the balance of the year.\n\nI wish, however, to ask the department through you for the use of whatever supplies were on hand when school closed here viz.: desks, blackboards, maps, globe, and any other of the necessary articles on hand and also chalk.\n\nbiscuits be supplied for the children while we are holding school here.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nJ. A. Leller\nMethodist-Miss\nSaddle Lake\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith, a communication received from the Rev. J. A. Seller, Methodist Missionary at Saddle Lake, regarding the opening of the Day School on this reserve.\n\nAs you will note, he proposes opening the school in the Mission house, and intends giving it a trial in the month of October.\n\nHe also asks that he be allowed to use the old school material on hand, and that biscuits be supplied to the children.\n\nI might state that the supply of old school material on hand is very limited.\n\nI would respectfully recommend that the Department grant his request.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, October 1, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo enclosing a communication from the Rev. J. A. Seller, Methodist Missionary at Saddle Lake, in which he states that he proposes opening school in the Mission House and giving it a trial for the month of October.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Seller may be allowed to use the old school material on hand for this school and you may supply him with a small quantity of biscuits for the children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. E. Hughes, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nSaddle Lake\nOct. 5th\n\nFrank Redley Esq.,\nDeputy Dept. General of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWishing to teach the Indian children belonging to our work here (there being no day school here) I wrote through the Indian Agent here, asking the Deptt. for the use of desks, blackboards, books, etc., etc., that were on hand when the school was closed. We cannot begin school until we get this permission. Kindly see that our communication to the Deptt. is answered immediately and oblige.\n\nYours Truly,\nRev. J. Keller,\nMethodist Mission.\nOttawa, October 14, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 5th instant I beg to say that Mr. Agent Hughes was instructed on the 1st instant to allow you the use of the old school material on hand for the Saddle Lake School, which has been opened under your charge, and also to supply you with some biscuits for the children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. A. Seller,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nSaddle Lake\nOct 30th\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nToday closes three weeks of our experiment with the day school at Saddle Lake and so far as attendance is concerned the following is the result:\n\n- No pupils on the roll: 22\n- No of half-breed children (from agency): 3\n- No of Indian children: 19\n- Average of Indian children: 14\n\nThe parents are showing a very deep interest in the school and there are other children who are not yet in attendance but will be before long. We desire to ask the\nDepartment to officially open the school for the balance of the year i.e. until the end of next June.\n\nThere is practically no equipment and it is very difficult to conduct this school thus. We trust that we may have it opened officially and get before long the necessary supplies to have the school conducted.\n\nI am your respectfully,\n\nRev. J. Keller\nOttawa, November 6, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo in reference to the day school being conducted by you at Saddle Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the supplies asked for in your letter of the 12th ultimo were ordered from the Government Stationery Office on the 23rd of that month and will no doubt reach you shortly. If you require any further supplies you should send a requisition to the Department for them and they will be ordered. A supply of blank requisition forms is being sent you under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. D. McLellan,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. A. Seller,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nThe Secretary Department,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMrs. Setter, wife of the Missionary at Saddle Lake, Alta., has opened the school that was closed some time ago, by the Department.\n\nMr. Setter has written to me to the effect that they have twenty-two names on the roll, and an average attendance of fourteen, and are in need of a register, slates, books, maps and black-board. Would the Department favor the sending of these supplies?\n\nThey are holding the school in a room of the Mission House. This would give an opportunity to test whether this school should be re-opened, or not.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\n[Stamp: Schools Branch]\n\nNOV 11 1914\nOttawa, November 11, 1914.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant in reference to the school which has been opened at Saddle Lake and stating that Mr. Seller has written you to the effect that they are in need of a register, slates, books, maps and a blackboard.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that on the 12th ultimo Mr. Seller wrote to the Department asking to be furnished with some supplies. The articles asked for in his letter were ordered from the Stationery Office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe returns from this day-school will have reached you before this does and will reveal the fact that the average attendance of Treaty Indian children for the quarter was 11.5.\n\nIn November, I wrote the Department that giving the progress of the school up to this time and asking that the school be officially opened. To this I have not received any reply as yet and do not know whether it officially opened or not.\n\nWe, however, thought that it\nbe the proper course for us to send\nthe school returns through the Indian\nAgent here.\n\nIf this school has not been\nofficially opened does that mean that\nmy wife receives no remuneration for\nlast quarter. We have opened up a\nroom in our house and now are\nfairly well equipped for carrying on\nthe work. My wife is giving practically\nall her time to teaching. This means\nthat we must hire help to look\nafter our home. We cannot afford to\nhire the assistance and receive no\nsalary for teaching.\n\nShould this school not be\nofficially opened we will find ourselves\nin this predicament financially unable\nto continue at any longer and this\nwill be a very painful step\nfor us to take because of the interest\nbeing taken by parents and children,\nthe almost phenomenal progress of\nthe children. Two new names have\nbeen added to the roll since the school opened for this term. We therefore expect the attendance to be as good this quarter as last.\n\nWe trust that the department has officially opened the school and that the usual remuneration for last quarter will be forthcoming in the usual time.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nSADDLE LAKE, ALTA.\n\n11th January, 1915.\n\nSir,\u2014 \n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith, report of the Saddle Lake day school on Saddle Lake reserve in this agency for the quarter ended December 31st, 1914.\n\nHaving had no intimation that this school was to be formally opened, I have not been making monthly reports on same.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, January 25, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant forwarding the December quarter return of the Saddle Lake Day School.\n\nThis quarterly return shows that there was an average attendance of eleven children and the Department, in view of the attendance, has decided to allow this school to be open as long as the attendance warrants it and will pay a salary at the rate of $300.00 per year for the teacher's services from the first of October, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. E. Hughes, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nOttawa, January 25, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant with reference to the re-opening of the day school on the Saddle Lake Reserve.\n\nThe quarterly return for the December quarter has been received and, in view of the attendance as shown by this return, the Department has decided to allow a salary at the rate of $300.00 per year for the teacher's services from the first of October, last. The grant for salary will, however, only be continued should the average attendance as shown by the returns continue to be such as would warrant the Department in keeping the school in operation.\n\nAs this school is conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church the salary due for the December quarter, viz. $75.00, is being sent to the Treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society, Toronto.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. A. Seller,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nThe Secretary Department,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose you the report of the Day School at Saddle Lake, showing an enrolment of 14 pupils and an average of 11.5 for the quarter ending December 31st.\n\nMrs. Seller is teaching this school. She is the wife of our Missionary. They opened this school on account of the pressure that was brought to bear upon them for the education of the children, and they have given it a trial for the quarter. They are still continuing this school and I would like to know whether the Department will sanction this school being continued and if so, the paying of Mrs. Seller a salary of Five Hundred Dollars.\n\nYou will kindly let me know at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF. Ferrier\n\nTF/JM\nOttawa, February 1, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant enclosing the report of the day school at Saddle Lake for the quarter ending December 31st, last, and requesting that a salary at the rate of $500.00 per year be paid Mrs. Seller, the teacher, for her services.\n\nIn reply I have to inform you that the Department decided to allow the re-opening of this school provisionally and, if after a reasonable trial the attendance is shown to warrant it, the Department will increase the salary. In the meantime the teacher is being allowed salary at the rate of $300.00 per year from the first of October, last, the same as was previously paid the teacher of this school when it was formerly in operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Saddle Lake Indian Day School, dated May 17, 1915. Original on 117060-6\n\nAttendance, etc.\n\nNew and proper buildings, transport of pupils to and from the school and, first, I think, Indians to agree to regular attendance, compulsion to be agreed to by Indians, if they fail to carry out such a promise.\n\nBuildings and Premises.\n\nThere is the old school building, log walls, not in use for about 7 years and unfit for use. Location not good either. The school now in operation is held in the parlour of the parsonage. Too small and otherwise unsuited. Anyway neither Mr. or Mrs. Sellar disposed to use this room for this purpose much longer. They claim, with reason, upsets their home and home life. Agreed to its use for a period to test Indians as to their true desire for a school.\n\nGeneral Remarks.\n\nIf a day school to be maintained on this reserve, I think a new building first required. Building containing a class, dining and kitchen room as well as a vestibule and small store room to hold supplies. Building should be in most central location. Before I would provide such a building, I would ask the interested Indians to sign an agreement promising to send their children between ages of 7 and 12 years to this school. Agreement to include that they agreed to compulsion in event of them failing to meet promise. Then when children attain 12 years of age parents to agree to transfer them to a higher school\u2014say to Red Deer Industrial\u2014if the Department so desired. On such an agreement might be safe for Department to provide a proper new school building, transport and a mid-day meal. Might be necessary, too, to provide house accommodation for a teacher, some one who is capable and willing to give full time to the work. Schools where children go remain home or absent themselves from school for trivial reasons are, in my opinion, largely a waste of funds and energy. Children cannot be expected to advance in a strange language unless they attend school regularly. If schools are an advantage to Indians they should take advantage of them when provided and not \"play School\".\n\nSgd. J. A. Markle,\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, June 24, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your report on the Saddle Lake Day School I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that before undertaking the erection of a new building there it would be well for you to obtain a written agreement, such as you suggest, from the Indians interested in the school to see that their children attend regularly. On receipt of this agreement the question of erecting a school there will be dealt with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. A.

In the meantime the Indians might get out the logs and stone necessary for the foundation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. A. Selby,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following with regard to the Saddle Lake day school as it is now operated and express some opinions regarding a new school building and which I understand is under contemplation.\n\nAbout the end of May last I reported the desires of the Indians, chiefly advanced by the Rev. Mr. Sellar, for a new school. I suggested to the Department that it might be prudent to ask the Indians for some guarantee that they would use the school if it was provided. In a letter received from the Department, dated June 24, No. 117060/1, this suggestion was approved. For the reason that I was not likely to visit that reserve for some months I requested Mr. Agent Hughes to take up the matter with Mr. Sellar and the Indians. I advised being very particular with regard to the Indians understanding the question of compulsion, in event they neglected to send their children to the school if one provided, and to see that the signatures of the Indians were witnessed.\n\nSoon after I arrived at the Agency this month I learned that some sort of a document had gone forward to the Department but no copy was in the office and unable, therefore, to judge as to its merits. I learned at a later date that the Indians strongly objected to the compulsory clause and had only agreed to it when they were told that the Department were not likely to provide a school without. I learned also that the Indians had promised\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\npromised to provide the logs for the walls of said building and to erect these logs. Apparently they are satisfied, too, that the finishing of the building is to be awarded to them and that the Department is to pay them for this work. This, in my opinion, is too loose a bargain for they may demand an unreasonable sum for this work. Another question apparently unsettled is the cost of transporting the pupils to and from the school, for I presume it is the intention to provide a mid-day lunch and transport. It will require 3 transports to get the children at the school before 9:30 A.M. The Indians' habitations are several miles distant from the proposed site and which is a fairly central one. If only one transport supplied some of the pupils would likely be too late for the lunch. The cost of transport is likely to be about 50\u00a2 per day for each pupil.\n\nMy impression is that a far more satisfactory building could have been erected of frame than of logs. The Indians probably would have given about 15000' of lumber and if a frame building were erected on a substantial cement concrete foundation I feel sure the after expense would be much less than the annual cost of keeping up a log walled structure. I question whether the lumber could now be secured from the Indians. They would require time to get out logs to be sawn and the winter months is the proper period to do this.\n\nI do not know the policy of either the Department or the Methodist Church on this school question. If it is that this and similar schools are to be nurseries for the Red Deer Industrial School I suspect the Indians do not entertain this view. Their notion is that this and similar\nsimilar schools are intended to supplant the Industrial School. I question whether the Indians do not entertain still wider views. There are Indians on the saddle Lake Reserve who claim allegiance to the Roman Catholic Faith. Still my impression is that these same Indians, or some of them at least, are contemplating sending their children to the proposed new school, if it is provided. In fact I believe if they were allowed to so do some would withdraw children from the Blue Quill's School under the plea that they intended to send them to this new school. In fact it would not surprise me if some renounced their faith to carry this into effect.\n\nIf it is the policy of the Department and the Methodist Church to close up the Red Deer School and to operate mid-day lunch schools on this, the Whitefish Samson's and Paul's Reserves I think they may all be fairly successful if started on clear understandings with regard to regular attendance, the compulsion carried out from the start and efficient teachers placed in charge, but not otherwise.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInsp.\nOttawa, November 24, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your report of the 21st of September, last, on the Saddle Lake Day School I beg to say that the Department has not committed itself to anything in connection with the proposed re-opening of this school. Rev. Mr. Seller was told in August, last, that the Department would be prepared to undertake the erection of a new building as soon as plans and specifications were sent in and approved, but up to the present these have not reached the Department. When received the question of erecting a new building will receive due consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nJ. A. Markle, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRed Deer, Alta.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the Blue Quills Boarding School, dated May 19, 1916. Original on 116859-6\n\nMost of the pupils, if not all, that are in Standard I were enrolled during the last fiscal year. This fact is evidence to me that Indian children should be in constant attendance at school if it is expected that progress is to be made. Any hopes that I entertained regarding the work being done at the two day schools within this agency was considerably shaken after I inspected this institution. You have the quarterly returns of the three schools referred to and it is my opinion that if comparisons are made from the time the pupils now in Standards I and II were first enrolled at the 3 schools, you will, like self, question the prudence of continuing the operation of the day schools. The day schools are less costly, which is one item and it is about the only entry likely to be placed to their credit.\n\nSgd. J. A. Markle,\nInsp.\nSaddle Lake\nSept 28th\n\nMr. C. Hughes, Indian Agent\nDear Sir,\n\nIt is the prevalent idea that the Indian Day School is a total failure, and this conclusion has been arrived at, not without reason. In comparison with the work done in Industrial and Board schools, the day-schools fail very low. And yet, there is a conviction that the day-school need not be a total failure.\n\nI seem to me that much might be accomplished, if the work were more strictly confined to the teaching of reading, writing and arithmetic, while an extreme effort is made to have the pupils understand what they are reading about, and as far as possible to have them speak the English language. With this conviction in my mind, I have taken hold of the work of this school this year, with the idea of making a test year of it. I want to know for myself just what can be accomplished in one year, by keeping the pupils constantly at work, and requiring them to ask and answer.\nquestions, during the English language lesson, they are asked to answer first in English then in Cree and English alternately, sentence by sentence, and finally I have them answer me in English only. I do not doubt the very effectiveness, they get a good grasp of the meaning of each lesson story. I have reason to believe, that, as soon as the raising is over, we will have a more regular attendance than has been usual, since this school began. We have found it necessary to keep the children employed every moment of the time from opening in the morning until blowing at dinner; and this, I feel, ought to be of great value for their moral effect. Some have said all education was futile, and that it is the acquisition of English that ought to be chief concern.\n\nNow, I believe we do the best possible work. We must receive much nourishment from many of the pupils here, yet, there seems nothing ideal about any child whatever, wholly dependent on it. We secure food for them. Most of them come to us distances from one to four miles, so that they have to leave immediately, and it is late when they get home again. It is my belief that\nThese pupils would do much better work and would enjoy their school life infinitely better if a warm meal were provided for them each day at noon. This would necessitate meat of some kind, rice, beans and seasoning. Also the necessary equipment for cooking and serving. The following list I think will include all requirements.\n\n180 lbs meat (3 months' supply)\n60 lbs rice (do)\n25 lbs beans (do)\n10 lbs salt (do)\n1 lb pepper (do)\n\n1 - 10 qt kettle\n1 ladle\n2 dozen plates\n2 dozen cups\n2 dozen spoons\n1 water kettle\n1 3 qt teapot\n1 large granite jug\n5 lbs tea (3 months' supply)\n25 lbs sugar\n1 - 10 qt granite dishpan\n10 yds glass towelling for dishwipes\n\nThere has been no adequate provision of wood for the school during the last two years. I must request that in addition to the above-mentioned supplies\nyou ask the Department of Indian Affairs\nto take the necessary steps to give us\na sufficient supply of wood, ready-cut\nfor the winter's need. We ask also,\nthat someone be appointed to make\nfirewood and collect fuel each day.\nI respectfully submit these requests\nto you and urge you to the\nconsideration of the Department.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMrs. J. H. Teller\nTwo years ago Mrs. Keller and I cleared out one of the rooms in our house and there held school for the Indian children. This school had been closed for several years. During the subsequent year we proved to the Department that it ought to be reopened which was done and a teacher was regularly appointed. The most of last year school was held in an Indians' house which was available. In the meantime your Dept., after considerable correspondence promised to erect a new school building but no sooner were we ready with plans & specifications bills of lumber etc. were sent.\npostponing building until the war is over. This has left us in a bad plight. Can nothing be done by the Department to help us in this situation? The old school building still stands but it would cost upwards of $200 to make it fit to use as a school. No Indian house is available. Shall this school be closed for a need of a building? Considering that it is a serious thing to have these children grow up without an education what does the Department advise in the matter?\n\nI beg to submit to your consideration these above matters of interest to me. Yours sincerely,\n\nRev. J. Keller\nSaddle Lake\n\nJune qtr. 1916 - 17 - 7.5\nMarch qtr. 1916 - 22 - 8.5\nDec qtr. 1915 - 19 - 10\nSept qtr. 1915 - 13 - 6\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nSADDLE LAKE, ALBERTA.\n\nSeptember 28th, 1916\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith, a letter received from Mrs. J.

She states that it is the prevalent idea that the Indian Day school is a total failure.\n\nSpeaking from my own experience, I regret to state that the Day schools here have proved to be a failure.\n\nThe mid-day meals given at these schools are an inducement to some of the pupils to attend school for a short time but the novelty of going to school for a hot lunch soon wears off and in my opinion, these meals are a detriment to the parents of the children who are attending school as well as the children themselves, as they are given object lessons in expecting to receive something for nothing, and the indolence and pauperism which is to be found on the reserves, could, I believe, be traced back to some such beginning as this in a good many cases.\n\nAs an illustration, I would quote the Whitefish Lake Band No. 125. These people had been receiving rations and assistance in different other forms until some three years ago. Since that time, with the exception of three or four cases which have been supplied, no rations have been issued and in the last three years or so, the Indians there have\nhave made more progress than they have ever done in twice the time previous to the closing of the ration house, and I believe that this was due to the fact that the Indians were given to understand that they were expected to work for a living and that they were not to expect the issue of rations regularly as they had been formerly.\n\nThe same might be said of the Indians of the Saddle Lake reserve. A liberal ration has been allowed these Indians regularly and they had formed habits of loafing around home until they were hungry and then coming to the ration house where they took it for granted, free rations would be issued to them.\n\nLast Spring, the quantity of rations usually issued was cut down and I have not seen any suffering among the Indians to date and in fact, I believe that they have made a better living this year (considering the scarcity of money) than they have done in other years.\n\nIn view of what I have learned from my experience with the Day schools and from the foregoing facts, I have come to the conclusion that the sooner the young Indians are taught and given to understand that they must be self-supporting, the sooner we will see an improvement in conditions among the Indians, and in my opinion the children should learn this in the schools, instead of being led to think that they had a right to expect assistance.\n\nUnder the circumstances and from what I know of existing conditions, I do not feel that I can make any recommendation in connection with Mrs. Seller's requests.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nSaddle Lake\nOct 23rd\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to ask you why the salaries of teachers in Indian day schools are not uniform. Last year the Saddle Lake school teacher received $500.00 and I understand that the Whitefish Lake school teacher received $600.00 and the work of each teacher was practically the same and if one was better qualified than the other the Saddle Lake teacher had the advantage.\n\nNot seeing the reason for this I thought I would write you making enquiries. Thanking you for your prompt and kindly replies to my former letter.\n\nYours respectfully,\nH. Keller\nOttawa, November 2, 1916.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo in reference to the salary paid the teacher of the Saddle Lake Day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department pays the salaries of the teachers of the Methodist Indian day schools at the rate asked by the Rev. Mr. Perrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian schools. I may inform you that there is no Whitefish Lake School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRev. J. A. Keller,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMrs. J. A. Seller has been teaching the day school at Saddle Lake since Sept. 1st. She holds a first-class certificate (honor) from the Board of Education of Prince Edward Island. She also has a knowledge of the Cree language and I think will give excellent service. I understand she prepares a noon day meal for the children. If so it is just possible that the salary should be $600.00, the same as it is at Whitefish Lake.\n\nMy request for salary at this point in October is on the basis of $500.00. Would the Department favor the salary being placed at $600.00?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\nOttawa, December 21, 1916.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant asking that the salary of Mrs. J. A. Seller, teacher of the Saddle Lake Day School, be increased to $600.00 per annum.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to grant Mrs. Seller any increase at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian School,\nBrandon, Man.\nJuly 26th, 1920.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe - Hudson's Bay Co. v. Rev. E.R.\nSteinhauer - File 46162 LWH.\n\nOur clients, The Hudson's Bay Company, have a claim against the Reverend M.R. Steinhauer who is in your employment, in the amount of $86.78. We are very loathe to take up this matter with you, but we shall be glad if you will kindly communicate with Mr. Steinhauer and impress upon him the necessity of a gentleman in his position paying his just debts. If you do not wish to do this you might let us have the present address of the reverend gentleman.\n\nYours truly,\n\nLOUGHEED BENNETT & COMPANY\n\nPER..........................\nOttawa, August 31, 1920.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, relative to the indebtedness of Rev. E. R. Steinhauer to the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the address of this man is Saddle Lake, Alta. All cheques for his salary are sent to the Treasurer of the Methodist Missionary Society, Toronto, as the school which he teaches at Saddle Lake is conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church.\n\nMr. Steinhauer's services were engaged by the above authorities subject to the approval of the Department and it will not be possible to deduct the amount of his indebtedness. I would suggest that you bring this matter to the attention of the Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, Brandon, Manitoba.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nMessrs Loughhead, Bennett & Company,\nBarristers, Solicitors, etc.,\n122 Eighth Avenue, West,\nCalgary, Alta.\nExtract from Agent's Report on the Saddle Lake School\n11766-7 for the month of April.\n\nThere is apparently no progress being made.\n\nGeo. S. Dodd\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, May 19, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe agent of the Saddle Lake Agency, in his regular monthly report for the month of April last, states that there is, apparently, no progress being made by the pupils of the Saddle Lake Indian Day School.\n\nThis school is under the charge of Rev. R. B. Steinhauer and, as he does not appear to be making any success in the work, the matter of obtaining another teacher to replace him when the school reopens after the summer holidays, is submitted for your consideration.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you regarding the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. T. Barrier,\nSuperintendent\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to yours of May 19th, 118-5-1 re the teaching at Saddle Lake Indian day school:\n\nI fail to understand the criticism of your Agent regarding the work of Rev. R. E. Steinhauer. He did excellent work in the Hobema School and his services have always been very satisfactory. He is a graduate in Arts and I believe a very excellent teacher. However, I think the time has come when he should be relieved of the school duties. Not because of inefficiency but because of too many duties to perform. I would like to see Harry Steinhauer there as teacher and would be pleased if the Department would endorse the nomination.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndustrial School, Brandon\n\nTF/GD\nOTTAWA, July 13th, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, in which you state that Rev. R. B. Steinhauer is giving up duties as teacher of the Saddle Lake Indian Day School, and that you are nominating Mr. Harry Steinhauer for the position.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Harry Steinhauer at the same salary, viz: $600 per annum and bonus at the rate of $150 during the present fiscal year. You may inform him accordingly, and I will be pleased if you will arrange with him to begin duties when the school reopens after the present summer holidays. The Indian Agent is being informed accordingly.\n\nI would also like you to be good enough to state the qualifications and experience which he possesses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent, Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOTTAWA, July 13th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Reverend T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, has notified the Department that the Rev. R. B. Steinhauer is giving up duties as teacher of the Saddle Lake Indian Day School, and that he is nominating Mr. Harry Steinhauer for the position to succeed him.\n\nMr. Ferrier is being informed that the Department will approve of the appointment of Mr. Harry Steinhauer to begin duties when the school reopens after the present summer holidays. The salary allowed him will be at the same rate, viz: $600 per annum, together with the bonus at the rate of $150 per annum during the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeo. S. Dodd, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nOTTAWA, November 2nd, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from the Rev. R. B. Steinhauer, relative to the appointment, as janitor, of Mrs. A. Steinhauer at a salary of $25.00 per year. Mr. Steinhauer claims that he was authorized to appoint this janitor by Mr. Hughes, ex-Agent, and that the work has been satisfactory.\n\nWould you enquire into this matter and if you feel that the services of a janitor have been authorized by the Agent, and the work should be continued, we would be glad to have properly prepared vouchers, in duplicate, covering this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nGeo. S. Dodd, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith, return of the Saddle Lake Indian Day school for the quarter ended September 30th, 1921.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing the September quarter return of the Saddle Lake Indian day school. It is noted that the school was closed during the whole quarter and the teacher states that the reason for this was that the Indians were absent at their hay camps and consequently were too far from the school for the children to attend.\n\nKindly advise the Department if you consider that the teacher was justified in keeping the school closed during the September quarter, and you should also state if you consider that salary should be allowed the teacher for that period. No payment will be made until your reply is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nGeorge S. Dodd, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, No.118-5-1, with reference to the closing of the Saddle Lake Day school during the September quarter.\n\nIn reply, I beg to inform you that during the early part of August, Rev. R. B. Steinhauer spoke to me about closing the school until after haying, as there were no children coming. R. B. Steinhauer at this time was substituting for Harry Steinhauer who was putting up hay and breaking on his own place.\n\nI advised him to close the school until such time as he would be assured of a reasonable attendance. Under the circumstances, I do not think that Steinhauer is entitled to salary for this period.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOTTAWA, December 9th, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nA return was received sometime ago from the Sadile Lake Indian Day School, which was for the quarter ending September 30th last. The school was closed during the whole quarter, the teacher stating, as a reason therefor, that the Indians were absent at their hay camps and consequently were too far from the school for the children to attend.\n\nWe referred this matter to Mr. Agent Dodd, asking him to advise whether the teacher was justified in keeping the school closed and if he considered that salary should be allowed for the quarter. The Agent, in reply, stated that Rev. R. B. Steinhauer, early in August last, spoke to him about closing the school until after haying as there were no children attending. Rev. Steinhauer at this time was substituting for Mr. Harry Steinhauer, who was putting up hay and breaking on his own place. The Agent advised that the school be closed until such time as the teacher was assured of a reasonable attendance and that, under these circumstances, he does not consider that Harry Steinhauer is entitled to salary for the quarter.\n\nAfter carefully considering the matter, it has been decided to allow payment of salary for the above quarter, together with bonus for the month of September. This payment is made in view of the fact that your Church Treasurer has, no doubt, forwarded salary to Mr. Steinhauer for that period. This brings up, however, the question as to whether the Department would be justified in paying to Church Treasurers the salaries of teachers who are not giving service by reason of the school under their charge being closed. We understand that in some cases this is not the fault of the teacher as the Indians are away from the Reserve while the teacher remains and renders service in other ways.\n\nAn expression of your views regarding this matter will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt., Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit the following reports on schools I have visited during the month of November.\n\nSaddle Lake Day School:\n\nAttendance 15, ventilation nil. Temp. of school 60\u00b0. Condition of school dirty, children receive hot tea at noon. About 2/3rds of the pupils require dental treatment. Morley Cardinal aged 11, vision of lt. eye defective. Lloyd Quimby aged 11 hearing of lt. ear defective. Children attending this school were extremely dirty, and poorly disciplined. Teacher did not impress me as being interested in his pupils nor the school. Absolutely no ventilation and school dirty. Mentality of the pupils was only fair.\n\nI have instructed all teachers to train the pupils in proper breathing exercises. So many children among the Indians are \"mouth breathers\" have stooped shoulders, indolent walks, very poor carriage and physiques.\n\nE. P. Johnston,\nTravelling Nurse.\nOttawa, December 17, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to draw your attention to a matter arising out of the report of Travelling Nurse E. P. Johnston. It is reported that the children attending the Saddle Lake Indian Day School were extremely dirty and poorly disciplined and that the teacher did not impress one as being interested in his pupils and school. The Nurse states that there was absolutely no ventilation and that the school was dirty.\n\nYou will please check up Mr. Harry Steinhauer and inform him that, if there is not an early improvement at his school, the Department will have to take steps to secure a successor who will give better satisfaction. Kindly inform the Department of your action, and keep us informed if there is any marked improvement at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nGeo. S. Dodd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nOttawa, December 17, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that I have written to Mr. Agent Dodd, instructing him to make an effort to have Mr. Harry Steinhauer, Teacher of the Saddle Lake Indian Day School improve the conditions at his school. You will remember that a Travelling Nurse, E. P. Johnston, in her report for November draws our attention to the extremely dirty condition of the children in the school and the teacher's apparent lack of interest.\n\nI have informed Mr. Agent Dodd that, unless there is a decided improvement in the near future at this school, the Department will take steps to secure a successor to Mr. Harry Steinhauer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, December 30, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer again to the report of Travelling Nurse E. P. Johnston. As I read her remarks concerning the Saddle Lake Indian Day School, a matter is brought to my attention that I overlooked at the time of my letter of the 17th instant. The Nurse claims that at the school mentioned the ventilation was nil.\n\nIn addition to the action that I requested in my last communication, would you, at the first opportunity, make arrangements to see that the pupils at the Saddle Lake Indian Day School get fresh air during their work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nGeo. S. Dodd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to yours of December 9th No. 118-5-1:\n\nI have made enquiries concerning the length of time taught by Henry Steinhauer and find the facts are as stated in your letter. I may say that the policy I have pursued on behalf of the Methodist Church is that teachers who are not engaged in any missionary work should not be paid for time that the school was closed unless the closing was authorized by the Department on account of sickness or some such reason. In the case of those in the two-fold work of teaching for the Department and doing missionary work, I have only asked the grant to be paid for the time the school is kept open. There are cases where it is impossible to reach the minimum of 200 teaching days for the year. In all such cases we ask for the grant for the time spent in the class-room. The Church pays the difference in consideration of the two-fold work done. In this particular case your Agent, Mr. Barnet, and Mr. Steinhauer held a conference and it is clearly understood that in future no salary will be paid for the time the school is closed during the teaching term, it being understood that 200 days is the minimum for a full year.\n\nI wish to express my appreciation of the fair consideration given the case in point.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndustrial School,\nOTTAWA, February 1st, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, regarding the period of service rendered by Henry Steinhauer, teacher of the Saddle Lake Indian Day School, and stating the policy of your church in regard to the payment of salaries to teachers holding a dual position as missionary and teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that the payment of salaries is to be based on 200 teaching days in the year and that, in the payment of salaries for broken periods, the teachers are to be paid in the proportion that the number of days taught during a quarter bears to the total number of teaching days in the year.\n\nIn the past we have always dealt generously in the payment of salaries for missionary teachers who have not taught the full number of days in each quarter on the grounds that they were performing related duties of equal value. We will, in future, continue to deal as generously as possible in cases of this kind.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir,\u2014\nReferring to your letters of the 17th and 30th ultimo, No. 118-5-1, I have the honour to inform you that I inspected the Saddle Lake Day school on the 25th instant. The floor was clean. I opened two of the windows and instructed Harry Steinhauer, teacher, to keep them open during teaching hours.\n\nThe discipline was very poor. I pointed this out to him. He told me that he would not teach after the mid-summer holidays as he was going onto a farm and that in all probability, he would send in his resignation early next month to take effect at the end of the March quarter, next, if he could not get a man to go on to his farm.\n\nI shall keep the Department informed as to his work.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, February 7, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 26th ultimo, referring to the Saddle Lake Indian Day School.

I am corresponding with Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, with a view to securing a new teacher for the first of April, 1922.\n\nA return, showing the attendance, days taught, etc., should be prepared before Mr. Steinhauer leaves the school and forwarded to the Department by you, so that the amount of salary and bonus due may be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Nine pupils were present on the day of my visit, 6 boys and 3 girls. I gave them a brief examination and found them very backward. They do not speak up well and I had difficulty in hearing them. The attendance in January was very poor owing to the severity of the weather. I found the building comfortable and the pupils present looked clean and healthy.\n\nIt is very apparent that the parents do not appreciate this school inasmuch as the pupils enrolled live within a radius of three miles and if they were interested, the attendance should be greater than it is. I may say that a number of the pupils have been recruited for the new Boarding school at Edmonton.\n\n(Mr. Miriam)\nInspector of Ind. Affairs\n\nNote - Original report on file 6 Blue Chilco's Sch.\nOttawa, March 18, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to that portion of Mr. Inspector Murison's report relative to the Saddle Lake Indian Day School. The Department is writing to the Methodist Church authorities, requesting them to give serious consideration to the advisability of closing this school and recruiting the pupils for the Edmonton Indian Residential School. The average attendance was 14.3 for the December quarter, but there are more children in the immediate vicinity that should take advantage of the opportunity offered at the day school. If any definite action is taken, you will be advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

The children who have attended should be recruited for the Edmonton Indian Residential School. Please inform Mr. Rankin, the teacher, and communicate with the Rev. Principal of the Edmonton institution, so that he can take concerted action with the Indian agent with a view to having the children placed in the residential school.

The children who are attending this school should be recruited for the Edmonton Indian Residential School and I should be pleased if you would communicate with the Rev. Principal of that institution with a view to taking concerted action in the matter of having the children admitted for the fall term.\n\nThe Methodist Church authorities will inform Mr. Rankin, the teacher, of the closing of the day school, but it would be advisable for you to give him official notice from this Department as well.

This has been brought to your attention on different occasions by this office; and it is a question whether this school should not be closed, and the pupils transferred to Edmonton School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Every effort will be made to recruit the pupils for Edmonton School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nSaddle Lake\nJuly 22nd 1924\n\nMr. D. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nThrough your local Agent, we have been informed that our Saddle Lake Day School is closed for good. When we heard that this was done, every Indian who has a child or lives protected against it. For this reason, they do not wish to part with their child or children when they are just reaching school age, taken away from them to some school situated some distance away. Parental responsibility is taken away from them, which is unnatural.\n\nThe school throughout the year has been very satisfactorily carried out its work through the leadership of Mr. Rankin. Children have made good progress in the last quarter, showed an average attendance of 11.2 out of an enrollment of 15.\nAs a rule attendance usually falls down, because people move away from their homes, but it so happens that the families from which children come have been staying on their homes and working on their land.\n\nBesides we have some supplies, such as wood, and some stationary, which are on hand heavy on the work.\n\nThe provision school was opened again.\n\nThe danger, I see in such a step is this, some poor protestant Indians are bound their children to this Roman Catholic Boarding School, where they can see them as often as they will and in the end become Catholics.\n\nThe sad mistake (allow me to point it out) the Department has made in the closing four Day School, is the idea of forcing the Indians to send their children where they don't think to be while very young.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. B. Graham\nOttawa, July 30, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, regarding the closing of the Saddle Lake Indian Day School. Your protest against the closing of this school and the reasons therefor have been noted.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the new Edmonton Residential School was erected for the purpose of providing educational facilities for the Protestant Indians of the Saddle Lake agency. It was the intention to close certain of the day schools and to recruit the children to the residential school. The Public School Inspector, in a report on his last inspection of the Saddle Lake School, stated that \"the attendance problem is a serious drawback to general progress.\" The Methodist Church Authorities have approved of the closing of the Saddle Lake School and Mr. Commissioner Graham, Regina, has recommended that this school be closed and the pupils transferred to the Edmonton School. The Department is not prepared to continue the day school and it is hoped that the Indian parents will see that it is in the best interests of the children that they be sent to the Edmonton Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. B. Steinhauer, Esq.,\nSaddle Lake,\nAlta.\nOttawa, August 25, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Mackie:\n\nI have been asked to reply to your letter of the 9th instant, addressed to His Excellency the Governor General, enclosing a petition from certain members of the Saddle Lake Indian Band. The day school on this reserve has been conducted in the past under the joint auspices of this Department and the Methodist Church Missionary Society. The Inspector of Indian Agencies, the Indian Commissioner and the Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools have agreed concerning the advisability of closing the day school at Saddle Lake and recruiting the children for the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nFor the 15 months ended March 31st, last, the average attendance at the Saddle Lake Day School has been less than 10. This record does not warrant continuing the activity, especially when there is a fine, new institution at Edmonton for the purposes of giving Indian children both academic and vocational training. You may inform the petitioners that the Department is not prepared to continue the Saddle Lake Day School and I trust they will be seized with the importance of taking advantage of the splendid facilities at the Edmonton Indian Residential School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent General.\n\nH.

A. Seller, widow of the Rev. J. A. Seller B. A. who some years ago was our missionary on the Saddle Lake reserve, was asking me regarding a record of her teaching experience in the day school at Saddle lake. Mrs. Seller has recently taken her normal training and has been accepted on the city staff here in Edmonton. It appears that previous experience has considerable to do with the standing she will have and also the salary, so she is anxious to have her full time as a teacher credited to her.\n\nShe taught in the Saddle Lake school from 1907 to 1909; and from 1913 to 1915. I would be glad if you would look up her record, reports of inspectors etc and send her a statement of her work so that it could be used by the department of Education here in Alberta. It is just possible that this may help her to obtain the desired standing. If this statement is sent to her through me I shall be glad to see that she receives it.\n\nYours Truly;\n\nJ.T. Woodsworth,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 26, 1924.\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nThis is to certify that Mrs. J. A. Seller taught at the Saddle Lake Indian Day School, which is conducted under the joint auspices of this Department and the Methodist Missionary Society, for four academic years: 1907-08, 1908-09, 1914-15 and 1916-17.

Our school at Cold Lake, it goes without saying is no exception to the general rule.\n\nWith such unsuccessful efforts, and knowing the governments desire to establish and maintain on all the reserves, Boarding Schools, which give entirely different results, I, in my turn, now take the liberty to make a request for such a school to be established here, assuring you that nowhere could such an institution be more usefully maintained than here.\n\nAll our Chipewyan desire to see their children well educated, and the children themselves generally like to come to school. What do we see however? Out of 43 or 49 children of school age, 10, 11, and occasionally 12, only, and always the same attend daily. Why do not the others come, because in the first place, they have\n\nIndian Commissioner,\n\nRegina.\ntoo great a distance to go over. As a matter of fact, only six live within something less than a mile from the school, some five or six more live within nearly two miles from it, some few others within 2\u00bd or 3 miles, others within 4 or 5 miles, others again within 6 miles, a good number are 3 or 9 miles away, and at last, few, 14 or 16 miles from the school. The reason of this is that many families who formerly and until recently were settled near my mission, have gradually dispersed, and went to live in proximity to their hay grounds, to avoid the ever increasing amount of hay which they had to transport.\n\nAgain, you must be aware that for a number of years the Government has left the Chipewayans to their own resources, giving them none of the help which is given to the other Indians on all the Reserves. Hence, for our people, both those of whom the children live near the school, and the others, periods of penury, of want which force them to take the gun and go to the bush with wife and children not to starve at home. This is a great reason for the frequent lowering of the schools average attendance. For all these reasons, I repeat, that nowhere could the establishment of a boarding school be more desirable than here. I therefore am bold enough to urge you to authorize us to open such a school, the operation of which to begin on the 1st July of next year 1896.\n\nI have told you at the beginning of this, that we had 43 or 49 children of school age. If you could authorize us to take about 40 boarders, the Sisters\nwhich we most probably will have by next year, will possibly be able to take the balance at their own cost, and so all would be in a position to receive the education they are so desirous of obtaining.\n\nsgd. L. Legoff. Ptr. O.M.I.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a translation of a letter from Rev. Father Legoff asking for the establishment of a Boarding School for the Chippewans at Cold Lake; and in reply I beg to say that owing to the greatly increased demands in a like direction, the Department cannot hold out much hope in this direction until it has seen how the Estimates for the current year are going to turn out. If any aid were granted in this direction, the Department would feel more like giving it by increasing the numbers provided for at the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Onion Lake and sending the children there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt:Genl:\nThe Assistant Indian Commissioner,\nRegina, N.W.T.\nS' Albert, 15 Oct. 1875.\n\nMy Dear Sir,\n\nRev. Father Legoff wrote to you lately to ask you to establish a Boarding School for the Indian Children of his reserve at Cold Lake. He has given you the reasons and motives for such request, the value of which you will appreciate.\n\nThere are but few reserves which are more deserving of such an aid from the Government. We have already gone ourselves to considerable expense with the object of obtaining means to take charge of this school and the Indians are extremely well disposed towards having their children well educated.\n\nBe kind enough, dear sir, to take great interest in this school and recommend the granting of the ordinary allowance for buildings and for the keeping of about forty children.\n\nAll the Indians of this Reserve are Chipewyans, &c., who, industrious, good labourers and very anxious to see their children taught the learning and proper use of true civilization.\n\n(Signed) X.

I will communicate with the Agent as to the advisability of reopening the same, but may say, the meanwhile that I have a letter on file from the Roman Catholic Missionary at that point stating that the houses of the Chippewa are three, six, eight and more miles away from the school and the children are therefore unable to attend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIndian Agent's Office,\nOnion Lake P.O.\n8th March 1900\n\nRef: Your Letter 5th Feb. 1900, No. 126/148.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter quoted and in reply to inform you that so far as I can judge from what I have seen of the Chippewa Indians and from what I can gather from the Mission and The Hudson's Bay Company, there is no reason to expect that a Day School at Cold Lake would be any more successful now than it was when the old school was there, and I do not think that the average attendance would be more than 7 or 8.\n\nIt is of course possible that if the band is allowed a farmer and their operations are successful that the most industrious of the Indians would remain at their farms and send their children to school, but while the whole band derive their living principally from hunting and fishing, it is unlikely that a day school could be successfully conducted.\n\nI have the honour &c.\n\n(Sgd) W.

I might, however, go a little further and say that I doubt that the average attendance can reach 7 or 8.

There are quite a large band of Indians and all Catholics, and a school for their children is so much more desirable that these Indians are still, to a great extent, hunters, and are obliged to take their children with them; so that a day school, always a very poor means of success, anywhere among the Indians, is of no practicability here.\n\nIt may be alleged that these children can be sent to the Onion Lake Catholic School, but this school is well filled and should be enlarged to receive all the children from Cold Lake. By building at Cold Lake it would be much more convenient for the Indians, &c., and preclude the necessity of enlarging at Onion Lake, for the present.\n\nThe survey of the Reserve has not been completed, I believe, but this could not be an objection, as it is practically certain that there is a Reserve there.\n\nHoping\nHoping that it will be found advisable to take steps at once, in order to have a Boarding School soon established near the Catholic Mission of Cold Lake,\n\nI have the honour to remain,\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nYour most respectful & obedient servant,\n\n+ Emile J.

Similar applications have been made to the Department on behalf of the Chippewyans in this neighbourhood since 1895.\n\nCold Lake is about one hundred miles north of Fort Pitt and no reserve has yet been surveyed for these Indians there, the Indians all being nomadic in their habits and unable to attend a day school. The Bishop is anxious to get a grant for the boarding school to be conducted in connection with the Roman Catholic Mission there.\n\nThis locality is not visited by our Inspector or Agent and the only information we have regarding these Indians is from the Roman Catholic Missionaries. There are said to be some fifty children of school age belonging to the Chippewyans who will receive no education unless a boarding school is provided, but it is a question in my mind what an advantage a day school would be to them, as they will for some years have to follow the chase for their living.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOTTAWA, 2nd January, 1902.\n\nRt.

Every time I have come to visit this reserve, the Indians have insisted on the necessity of having a Boarding School organized here, for the benefit of their children.\n\nThe objection, so far, from the Indian Department was that they had no surveyed Reserve; but this objection exists no more, as the Reserve has been surveyed for about four years. The Boarding School of Owen Lake is not very far away, it is here (about 70 miles), but after a trial, the Chipewyans strongly object to have their children mixed with Cree children, as they pretend that they do not agree very well together.\n\nBesides, they are numerous enough to have a Boarding School of their own, and they protest that it will be easy to have it filled with pupils. They number together about 62 families, and there are a number of families at Heart Lake that would also supply a number of pupils.\n\nThe Indians of this Reserve are all Christians, and as far as I know them, I believe that indeed they would feel and act towards the School, in a manner different from the other tribes, as they more willingly listen to the advice of their missionary.\n\nFor all these reasons I hope that their reiterated demand will meet with the desired solution.\n\nAnd I have the honour to remain, Honourable Sir,\n\nYour Very respectful and obedient servant, + Emile Joseph, P.P.,\n[Signature]\n\n[Seal]\nOttawa, September 6, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\u2014\n\nBishop Legal has again applied for the establishment of a boarding school on the Cold Lake reserve, Treaty 6, Alta.\n\nThey have been agitating for a school of this class there since 1895. That was previous to the setting apart of the reserve. In 1900 the Commissioner, who was asked to report as to the number of children that would be likely to attend if a day school were established there, said there would not be more than an average of seven or eight. Since that date we have had no further information, although a renewal of the application was made in December, 1901, on which the Minister said, \"Let stand for present\".\n\nWe have no reports concerning this band, but if the department is inclined to consider the Bishop's request, Inspector Chisholm might be asked for a report. It seems to me that any children that it would be necessary to send to a boarding school could be placed in the Onion Lake, as I do not consider the objection the Bishop states the Indians have to this school is any valid excuse for not sending them there.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, September 16, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nHis Lordship Bishop L\u00e9gar\u00e9, of St. Albert, has applied to the Department for the establishment of a new boarding school on the Cold Lake reserve for the benefit of the Indians residing there, and as there is little or no information on record in the Department concerning this band, it would like you to send in a report on this application in time for consideration when the estimates for the next fiscal year are being taken up.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nW. J.

McLean\nSecretary.\n\nThe Right Rev. Emile J. Legal, O.M.I.,\nBishop of St. Albert,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nOffice of the Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n\nBATTLEFORD INSPECTORATE,\nNorth Saskatchewan Inspectorate,\n\nPrince Albert, Sask. October 19th, 1907\n\nRef. Your letter No. 162985 of the 16th September.\n\nSir,\n\nComplying with instructions contained in your letter above quoted I have the honor to report as follows:\n\nThe Chippewayan band at Cold includes 271 persons, of whom 60 are between the ages of 6 and fifteen inclusive, and 60 are under 6 years. It will thus be seen that the population eligible by age for attendance at school is large, and is likely to be recruited from year to year, according as these pass the age limit, from those who are now under the minimum age.\n\nOf those who are between 6 and 15 years 35 live within the limits of the reserve, and with few exceptions within two miles of a central point at or near the Mission; while 25 live outside the reserve, for the most part on the north side of the Beaver River, (the reserve being on the south), and at distances of from two to five miles from the Mission.\n\nThe reserve includes two townships, being 8 miles from east to west and nine miles from south to north; but only the northern and north-eastern portion is occupied by the Indians. Those living on the reserve could, accordingly, be served by a day school; but when the day school was in operation, as it was for several years, the attendance was but poor, although the Indians lived then in nearly the same places as at present.\n\nThe agitation for the establishment of a boarding school here has been going on for some years locally, and it has\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nit has been discouraged by the Agent and myself in the interest of a better attendance at the Roman Catholic school at Onion Lake. The Chippewyans, however, send their children only with reluctance, if at all, to the Onion Lake school, where the attendance is otherwise entirely Cree. They recall the fact that a number of the children they have sent there have died, and they claim they have been at times ill-used by their schoolmates, regarding the Crees as a rougher class than themselves.\n\nI never found that their fears as to their children being ill-treated were justified, although it is true in any Indian school that the vex ill treatment of the younger by the older, the weaker by the stronger, would be a matter of daily occurrence if it were not for the vigilance of those in charge. And as for the sickness and death of some of their children, the fault does not belong peculiarly to this or any other school, for it is only too well known that boarding school life is unsuited to the Indians of this generation and distinctly injurious to their health.\n\nHowever, as regards the case in question, the boarding school at Onion Lake has not served, and is not likely to serve, the needs of the Chippewayan band; and as against the general objection to boarding schools above referred to there are two main considerations in favor of the establishment of a boarding school for this band. In the first place the population is so scattered, on and outside of the reserve, that they cannot in any large measure reap the benefits of a day school; and secondly, now that the hunt is failing, these people are becoming poorer year by year, and in many cases are unable to feed and clothe their children properly. A boarding school would, accordingly, to a greater extent than on most reserves, be a charitable as well as an educational institution.\n\nThere is little doubt that in case a boarding school were established on this reserve admission would be sought for nearly all the healthy children of school age in the band.\n\nYet,\nYet, since under a strict medical examination a large percentage would probably be found ineligible, a school with accommodation for thirty pupils would be sufficient. There is also a small band of Chippewayans at Heart Lake, about sixty miles to the west, who are a branch from this band, and whose children could be accommodated here.\n\nIf, however, it is the policy of the Department to restrict the development of the boarding school system, the work of education could be accomplished otherwise. About two-fifths of this band live outside the reserve and for the most part on the north side of the Beaver River. The land they occupy is not so favorable for agriculture as on the reserve; yet it is by no means bad; and as they are persistent in their request for an extension of the reserve northward across the Beaver River and toward Cold Lake, the entire band would, I think, agree to the exchange of a portion of good land in the southern or western part of the reserve for an equal area north of the river. If this were granted the location of the various families would be fairly well fixed, and two day schools, one near the Mission and the other a few miles north of the River, would serve the needs of the band, one or other being within reasonable distance of all with a very few exceptions. Provided two such schools were furnished with capable teachers devoted to their work, the children of destitute parents clothed, and a plain but wholesome meal provided for the children at noon, in addition to the usual accessories of school work, the work of education would be accomplished, and the general well-being of the children attained, under very favorable conditions and at a moderate cost.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, November 8, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nBishop Legal, of Prince Albert, has again applied for the establishment of a boarding school at Cold Lake reserve, Treaty 6, Alta.\n\nAs there was no information before the Department, on which a decision could be arrived at, Mr. Inspector Chisholm was asked for a report. He has complied with the Department's instructions, and I think you will agree with me, after reading his report, that there is very little necessity for a boarding school at this point.\n\nMartin Beaver\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to inform you that at recent treaty payments the Indians of Chipewyan band No.124 made a strong request that Boarding School be opened on their reserve.\n\nThe band is altogether Roman Catholic, and I met them with the reply that the R.C.School at Onion Lake was open to them and that they should send their children there. They, however, would not pay any heed to my advice, the objections being the distance of 60 miles that would separate them from their children, and the overbearing treatment that they expect them to receive from the Cree children who would many times outnumber them.\n\nTo impress upon me that they were not speaking for speaking sake, they said that every time I visited the reserve they would renew their request, and ask me to recommend the Department that it would be granted.\n\nThere are in the neighbourhood of 60 children in the whole band of school age, of whom over half the number live on the reserve. I do not know what kind of schools the Department are at present in favour of, but if there is any intention of increasing the number of boarding schools, I am under the impression that one on the Cold Lake reserve would have a good attendance.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\nNo. 99\n\nOttawa, August 30, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 16th inst., I beg to inform you that no provision has been made in this year's estimates for the establishment of a boarding school on the Cold Lake reserve and the matter will have to stand for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW.

The chances of the band having a second reserve on the shores of the lake are considerably enhanced, and, although some of the families will be residing on one or the other of the reserves more than heretofore, having to attend to farming operations, many will still persist in hunting; which, in addition to the fact that the Indian houses are widely scattered, forces me still to think that a boarding school is the kind most suitable for these Indians.\n\nI would be glad to know if the department contemplates opening a school for these Indians at no far distant date.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSIR,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 27, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th inst. in reference to the establishment of a boarding school for the Chipewyan Indians at Cold Lake, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to meet the wishes of the Indians in this respect at present.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW.

Should the present proposed arrangement be carried through it is thought that day schools would meet the educational needs of these Indians and you will be good enough to bring the matter up again when the time is opportune.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nW. Sibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nTo the Superintendent general of Indian affairs Ottawa.\n\nSt. Albert, Alta., July 3,\n\nVery Honorable Sir,\n\nOn the occasion of my recent visit to the Reserve of Cold Lake Reserve, a very large gathering of Indians have come again, and asked my assistance with the view of obtaining from the Indian Department, the establishment of a Boarding School on this Reserve, under the auspices of the Catholic Church.\n\nAlexander Piche', considered as the head man of the tribe, has explained the claim with the approbation of all present.\n\nThe population of this Reserve is about 180 souls, and there is another Band of Chipewyans, located at Heart Lake, about 70 miles N.W. which is visited by the Missionary of Cold Lake. This Band is about 100 strong. All these Indians, to the unit, are Catholics.\n\nThere are about 50 children of school age at Cold Lake, and 20 more at Heart Lake.\n\nThe Indians request for a Boarding School, as all former attempts to establish and keep up a day school, have proved to be a failure. The Indians promise to readily put their children in the Boarding School, and not to take them away, when they will go in hunting expeditions.\n\nThe Boarding\nThe Boarding school at Onion Lake is not far distant indeed, but the Chipewyan children do not very well agree with Cree children, and the Cree Reserve are amply able to supply the number of children for that school.\n\nThis petition of the Chipewyans has been received, I may say, every time I have been visiting them, and personally I have always encouraged their demand, which seems to me perfectly just and reasonable.\n\nI fully believe that these Indians, more than many others, have a very strong claim on the Department, and that this time it will be favorably considered and receive its sanction.\n\nI have the honour to remain,\n\nVery Honourable Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEmile J.

L\u00e9gar\u00e9, O.M.I., D.D.,\nBishop of St. Albert,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nWinnipeg, 9th August, 1910.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nWhen I rested at Cold Lake en route from Onion Lake to the Saddle Lake School, I was waited upon by the Chief and leading men of the Chipewyan Band, No. 124, whose Reserve is in the vicinity of the lake.\n\nThey represented to me that there are some fifty children of school age in the Band, and that they urgently desire that they should have the means of receiving a good education, moral, as well as mental and manual. They stated, with intelligent appreciation of changing conditions, that the pressure of white settlement must push farther and farther into the background the Indian untrained in the means employed by the white man for securing a livelihood and ensuring advancement.\n\nWith equally intelligent appreciation of their own condition, which makes day-schools for their children educationally futile, they very emphatically made known that what they desired was a boarding, not a day school! \"We go,\" they said, \"hunting and trapping, and we have to take our children with us. We would lose the means of making a livelihood in which we are skilled were we to remain at home to send our children to a day-school, were there one. That is out of the question. The only way to really provide for the education of our children is by establishing a boarding school.\"\n\nThere would not be room enough to accommodate all the available children of this band at the Onion Lake School. In addition to the children on the Cold Lake Reserve there are Chipewyan children lacking the means of education at Hart Lake.\n\nBut even if there were room at the Onion Lake School,\nor if its capacity were increased for the purpose of providing\nfor them, it would be practically impossible to prevail upon\nthe Chipewyans to send their children to a school in which Crees\npredominate. \"We do not\" said their leader, \"like to send our\nchildren to school with Cree children, for they do not get along\nwell together\". But the objection lies deeper than that. The Crees\nand Chipewyans are hereditary enemies. They are of distinctly\ndifferent stocks. They differ in character, and differ consider-\nably even in external appearance. The line of cleavage is\nwell marked in their languages.\n\nThe Chipewyans are tractable and teachable; and it\nwould be sound policy to provide them with acceptable means of\neducation. They expressed a keen desire for a boarding school;\nand my enquiries compelled the belief that they are determined\nto make good use of one, if provided. They assured me they would\nbe grateful for the boon.\n\nAt Cold Lake and at part Lake the Indians are all\nCatholics, and those who approached me distinctly asked for a\nboarding school under the auspices of the Catholic Church.\n\nAn elderly man and a leader among his people,\nstated that when Governor Morris made the treaty with them\nhe promised that provision would be made for the education of\ntheir children; and he complained that since that time nothing\nhad been done for the education of the Chipewyans, whose children,\nin the meantime, were to their very great disadvantage, growing up\nin ignorance.\n\nI was given to understand that these Indians had\nseveral times asked the Department to establish a boarding\nschool for them.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear that the Department will\nfavorably consider making early provision for establishing the\nmuch desired school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nI.R.C.I.S.\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nAugust 6th, 1910.\n\nSir:\n\nWith regard to the Chipewyan band No. 149, they then spoke about the delay in surveying the new reserve, vide your file No. 232842 and the prospects of having a boarding school, vide your letter January 5th last No. 132 985/1, and said that when these two matters were settled they would be more ready to comply with the department's wishes.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) W.

In case a day or boarding school were opened here, in accordance with the request of the Indians, (See later in this report), it might be possible to arrange for nursing at the same time.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW.

The band made a unanimous and very urgent request that the Department should be petitioned in their behalf for the establishment of a boarding school. They maintain they have had an unfavourable experience with male teachers; and they want a school conducted by the Sisters. They do not want a day school either; in fact, it is clear that a main object with them is to be relieved of the support of their children, provided the latter are not taken away from the reserve. The Agent, I understand, furnished the Department with particulars as to the school population of the reserve.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW. J. Chisholm,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 23, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report of inspection of the Onion Lake Agency, and in reply to that portion in which you deal with the establishment of a boarding school for the Cold Lake Indians I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to erect a boarding school at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. Chisholm, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 5, 1910, I have the honour to draw the department's attention to the fact that the securing of a second reserve for a portion of the Cold Lake Chipewyan band has now been so far completed that the question of establishing a school or schools for these Indians deserves attention.\n\nIf the day school system is adopted of course it would be necessary to have a school on each reserve, as there is a distance of about 12 miles between them. The position in this case is one in which a Boarding School would, in my opinion, be most successful. The Indians, although now turning their attention to farming, are still hunters, and so long as the hunt lasts they will devote the winter months to that mode of living, and in many cases would take their children with them if there was not a Boarding School in which to leave them. The Indians, and a large majority of the settlers, belong to the Roman Catholic Church, and, in the longer established reserve, that on the south side of the Beaver river, there is a Roman Catholic Mission in connection with which it is probable the Roman Catholic Church would readily establish a Boarding School, and to it, I feel sure the Indians of the newer reserve would be sure to send their children.\n\nThere are about 40 children of school age, counting those of each reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, February 24, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared at the present time to consider the erection of a boarding school for the Indians of the Gold Lake Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. Gibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honour to report that on the evening of the 6th instant, when visiting Cold Lake Reserve, the Chief and two of his Councillors came to see me for the first time since their appointment.\n\nThe Chief referred to the meeting as being the first, and on that account hoped that his first request would not be refused as it had been when made several times previously. His request was for a Boarding School on the reserve. I told him that I regretted that his first request was one which I feared the Department could not entertain, in view of the fact that the Boarding School at Onion Lake, conducted by the R.C. Church to which his band belonged, was open to receive their children. The Chief insisted, however, that I should submit his request to the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgn. W. Sibbald.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 3, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo reporting that when visiting the Cold Lake Reserve the chief and two of the councillors applied to you for the establishment of a boarding school on their reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it will not be able to comply with their request at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAasst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. Sibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nWhen last at Cold Lake I had a conversation with the Rev. Father Dauphin relative to the possibility of having a Day School on that reserve. There is an old log building, formerly used as a church, situated at a little distance from the present Mission buildings, which, if the Department would bear the expense of moving, re-roofing and fitting up as a Day School, the Mission would attend to the work. Pulling down, re-building and re-roofing would cost in the neighbourhood of $250.00, in addition to which would be the cost of desks and other school fittings. The usual grant would, of course, be expected. The R.C. Mission would arrange for the accommodation of three Sisters, one of whom would be teacher, another a nurse who would visit and assist the sick people where nursing is required; whilst the third would be a general assistant and companion to the nurse on her visits to the Indians.\n\nI understand that some letters have passed between the Department and the R.C. Church authorities relative to establishing a hospital at Cold Lake; no doubt the present proposition is made in hope that a hospital will be allowed at some future time.\n\nThere would not be any difficulty in getting from 25 to 30 pupils for the Day School.\n\nI would be glad to have the Department's view of this matter at your early convenience.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\nhave made and spoke to them of\nthe prospects of the establishment\nof a boarding school and a hospital.\nUnder cover of a letter of\neven number dated 1st inst. I\nsent you a letter received from\nHis Lordship devoted chiefly to\nthe day school for Redvers' reserve\nbut in which he referred briefly to\nthe Cold Lake school. No doubt\nhe has also communicated with\nthe Department on both subjects,\nand I would recommend their\nsupport of the Department\nin both projects.

Day School on Cold Lake reserve No. 149.\n\nDuring a recent trip I visited that reserve on the evening of Sept. 24th and on the following day called on the Rev. Father Dampier at the R.C. mission.\n\nThe boys of the building referred to in my letter above quoted have been removed by the church authorities onto the mission property and have since been re-located with a view to providing a dwelling for the resident priest. The roof is in course of construction and the building is quickly approaching completion.\n\nThe intention is to devote the main part of the building now occupied by the priest to a home for three R.C. Sisters and to use the part of the house now used as a kitchen as a school room. One of the sisters is to be the school teacher and one a nurse whose duty it will be to visit the sick; the third will be a nursing companion and general helper.\n\nHis Lordship Arch Bishop Leger had been visiting the reserve and told the Indians of the arrangements that had\nOttawa, December 9, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 2nd of October last, I beg to say that the Department is prepared to agree to the proposition of Bishop Legal to make a trial of a day school on the Cold Lake Reserve on the same terms as allowed for the school at Long Lake, but, as His Lordship intimates that he intends placing sisters in charge of this school instead of a man and his wife, the Department will accept this arrangement. As His Lordship has a room ready for occupation this scheme may be given a trial. You may make a requisition for enough material to give this school a start.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Father Grandin has been advised that the Department will accept the proposition of His Grace Archbishop Legal in connection with the establishment of a day school on the Cold Lake Reserve and he has been informed that a grant of $400.00 per annum will be allowed for a teaching sister and $300.00 per annum for her assistant, who is also to act as field matron. A copy of the instructions to field matrons has been sent to Father Grandin. In addition to this the Department has agreed to pay a rental of $240.00 per annum for the accommodation offered by His Grace for the carrying on of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Sirs,\n\nReferring to the interview had with you last week in regard to the establishment of a day school on the Cold Lake Reserve I beg to say that the Department is prepared to agree to the proposition made by His Grace Archbishop Laval to give this school a trial and will make a grant of $400.00 per annum for the salary of a teaching sister and of $300.00 per annum for an assistant, who is also to act as field matron. A copy of the Memorandum of Instructions for Field Matrons on Indian Reserves is enclosed herewith. In addition to this grant for salary the Department will be prepared to pay a rental for the accommodation furnished by His Grace the Archbishop at the rate of $240.00 per annum.\n\nMr. Agent Gibbald will be advised accordingly and requested to make a requisition for enough material to give this school a start.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDuncan C.

The alterations made in the mission building causes the room used as a school room to be much smaller than the one that was first intended for that purpose so that if the Department has decided to erect a day school it would be advisable to build as soon as possible.\n\nI would remind the Department that the R.C. church has in view the establishment of a boarding school and a hospital on this Chipewyan reserve. I would recommend a hospital but I think a day school would be preferable to a boarding school.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Sibbald,\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to letter from this office of June twenty-ninth and to inform you that at recent treaty payments on the Chippewa Reserve I called at the school and found about fifty children there, but regret to say that on 28th inst., since my return, I received a letter from the Rev. Father Dampier of the Mission there informing me that ten cases of fever had broken out in the school and calling for the Doctor. I at once wired to Dr. Charlebois to attend and when I have further particulars will write again.\n\nWith regard to establishing a regular Day School on the Chippewa Reserve there is no doubt in my mind that it would be well attended and I feel sure would be otherwise a success. The alterations made in the mission building causes the\nroom used as a school house to be much smaller than the one that was first intended for that purpose so that if the Department has decided to erect a Day school it would be advisable to build as soon as possible.\n\nI would remind the Department that the R.C.

Gibbald\nIndian Agent\n\nMr. Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOct.\nOttawa, October 24th., 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nwith reference to the cheque which is going forward to you in payment of the salary for September quarter of Sister Eugenia as teacher of the day school at Cold Lake Reserve, which school was opened in June last, I have to request that you will inform the Department whether an assistant teacher, who is to act as field matron has been employed. The Department wrote you in this matter on the 10th January last and sent you printed instructions with regard to field matron work. You were told in that letter that $300.00 a year would be allowed for the services of a teaching sister, who should do field matron work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. Sibbald Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nExtract from letter from Archbishop Legal of Edmonton, dated July 21, 1917. Original on 442062.\n\n502973,\n\nYour circular of last 27th of June has just reached me here when I was considering the advisability of writing you on various subjects.\n\nOf course I appreciate very much the initiative taken by your Department of increasing by $10.00 the per capita grant of all residential schools conducted by the different religious denominations on Indian Reserves. This is perfectly justified by the increased cost of everything necessary for the maintenance of said schools.\n\nI intended to write you about the particular conditions of this Indian Reserve of the Chipewyan of Cold Lake. The Indians are indeed very much pleased to see that a start has been made towards the establishment of a hospital for their sick and of a school for their children, but it is only a start. The Rev. Sisters are here since the 3rd day of June, 1916. They have opened the day school on the 19th of the same month of June 1916. The school has been attended by an average of 30 to 35 pupils.\n\nTherefore I take the liberty to urge these two points:\n\n1. A reasonable increase of the grant for both staffs\nstaffs of hospitals, and school on same reserve, viz.\u2014\n\nI would suggest an increase of $25.00 for each salary.\n\n(Flour is paid here over $9.00 per hundred weight.)\n\nAddress St. Albert P.O., Alta.\nCold Lake -\nSister Eugenie salary $400\nSum quarter - 37 average 29\nave for the year 27\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nIn reference to that portion of Archbishop Legal's letter of the 21st ultimo in which he asks for an increase in the salary of the teacher of the Cold Lake Day School I beg to say that this school has been in operation for a year. During that time it has had an average enrolment of 37, with an average attendance for the year of 27.\n\nMr. Agent Sibbald, who visited this school on the 25th of May, last, reported that the pupils, who are all in the lowest standard, are progressing slowly and that the teacher has a ready manner of imparting knowledge to them.\n\nSister Eugenie is the teacher and she is paid at the rate of $400.00 per annum. In view of the large enrolment and average attendance I think the Department would be quite justified in giving the increase asked for.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nAugust 8, 1917.\n\nMost Reverend and Dear Sir,\n\nReferring to that portion of Your Grace's letter of the 21st July, in which reference is made to the Cold Lake hospital and day school, I regret to state that conditions have not changed since I wrote you on the 17th of May, 1915, and it is not, therefore, possible at the present time to proceed with the erection of the hospital.\n\nI am pleased, however, to comply with Your Grace's request to increase the salaries of the teacher and assistant teacher, which are now $400.00 and $300.00 per annum respectively, by $25.00 each, and they will be paid at the rate of $425.00 and $325.00 from the first of the current quarter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDuncan C. Scott,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMost Reverend E.J. Legal, O.M.I.,\nArchbishop of Edmonton,\nSt. Albert P.O.,\nAlta.\nMr. Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nIndian Affairs.\n\nSt. Albert, Aug. 17, 1917\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAcknowledging receipt of your letter of the 8th inst., I beg to say that I feel very much grateful to you for the increase by $25 per month of the salary of Teacher and Assistant Teacher at the Cold Lake Reserve day school.\n\nAnd I remain, Dear Mr. Scott,\n\nYour very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nEmile Legay,\nArchbishop of Edmonton.\nOttawa, October 12th, 1917\n\nSir:-\n\nI beg to inform you that the salary of the field matron, Sister Blanche, at Cold Lake has been increased from $300.00 per annum to $325.00 per annum dating from the 1st of July, 1917.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Sister Eugenie, the teacher of the Cold Lake Day School, has been laid up with typhoid so that the school has been closed for some time. I can't say exactly how long as I have not been at the reserve for some time.\n\nOne of the other sisters has written asking that the teacher may not be asked to supply a return for the quarter ending Dec 31st as she is not able to do so and a request is also made that the school may be closed for the month of January on account of the extremely cold weather, the month to be counted as part of the Annual holidays.\n\nMy intention is to leave for the Northern Reserve tomorrow and will let the Sisters know that January will be counted as part of the holidays and will arrange that the Dec return may be supplied when the teacher is strong enough to do so and I would ask that the usual cheque for the quarterly grant may be issued although the return is not yet rendered.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nJanuary 5th 1918\nOttawa, January 15, 1918.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant in which you state that the Cold Lake Day School has been closed for some time owing to the illness of Rev.

Hibbald\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOnt.\nOBLATE FATHERS\nPROVINCIAL HOUSE\nOblate Fathers\n1018-107th Street\nEdmonton, Alta.\nEDMONTON, ALTA., APRIL 5TH........1919\n\nD. Scott Deputy superintendent general\nof Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAllow me to draw your attention to the Cold Lake school, and to ask you what you intend to do for the Chippewyan children of this Reservation. The influenza has made quite a few orphans amongst them, and if you do not do something for them, they will live a miserable life. Belonging to no one, they will be passed from one family to another, and not well treated by any. You cannot send them to the Onion Lake school, as past experience has shown that Chippewyan children die when sent away from their reserve.\n\nCould you not build a small boarding school on this reserve for the number of children of school age. There are not so many of them, and as they cannot be sent out, it seems the only way to help them, above all the orphans who have no claim on any body but the Department.\n\nAdditions could be made to the present school to accommodate all the children, and without too great an expense. Please, Dear Sir, remember the Chippewyan orphans, and do come to their assistance.\n\nYours respectfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. [Signature]\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the request of Rev. Father Grandin to have a small boarding school on the Cold Lake Reserve for the accommodation of the Chippewayan children there I beg to say that he states that there are some children made orphans by the epidemic of influenza on the reserve and that the Indians object to sending their children to Onion Lake, as they claim that many of them die when sent away from the reserve. Father Grandin states that there are not many children there who would need to be provided for and he suggests that an addition could be made to the present building to accommodate them, without any great expense.\n\nThere is a day school in operation there, in charge of the Rev. Sister Eugenie, held in the mission building, which is the property of the Oblate Fathers.\n\nLast year Mr. Inspector Crombie suggested that the Department might advance them $250.00 for the purpose of purchasing lumber and erecting an addition to the present building to provide extra class-room accommodation; repayment to be made by the mission from the rent which they are charging the Department for the school-room, $240.00 per annum. On the 18th of June, last, Rev. Father Dauphin was asked whether he would be willing to carry out the Inspector's suggestion. No reply has been received to that letter.\n\nMr. Inspector Crombie, in his last report on the Cold Lake Day School, made in November, 1917, states that the school is doing good work, but, like other reserves where the parents earn part of their living by hunting, there are times when the children are kept from school. He also\nstates that there is a great opportunity here for school work and, if a good attendance can be maintained, much good will result. If a few boarders could be provided for, it would not be necessary for the parents to take the children with them when absent from the reserve, and the school work would not be interrupted.\n\nThe Department has no definite information as to the number of orphans there, and I would suggest that Mr. Inspector Crombie be asked for a report on Father Grandin's application.

you that it is impossible for me to teach the Day School at de Goff. I am tired and need a rest for a while and so the other sisters are not going back to the mission this year.\n\nAs to the provisions and school material we will see that they be kept safe until you have an opportunity to go there.\n\nI am sorry to give you such a disappointment, but hope that in a near future we will be able to resume our work amongst the Indians when the Department builds a Boarding School on the Reserve.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSister Eugenie.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith a letter received from Sister Eugenie, teacher at the Cold Lake Day School, which speaks for itself.\n\nI was at Cold Lake on August 24th and 25th, and whilst there visited the Mission and found that the Day School was closed. Father Balter, one of the priests in charge of the Mission, told me that the Sisters were having a holiday, but that he expected them back immediately, when the Day School would be re-opened. However, on my return to Onion Lake I found the enclosed letter from Sister Eugenie awaiting me.\n\nIf I do not hear any further from Sister Eugenie or Father Balter in the meantime, I will take the matter up on my next visit to the Cold Lake reserve, and will advise the Department of any development in the situation.\n\nIt would appear from Sister Eugenie's letter that Sister Marcelle, Field Matron, has also left the reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agency.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo enclosing a communication from Sister Eugene, teacher of the Cold Lake Indian Bay School, in which she states that it is not her intention to resume duties as teacher upon the re-opening of the school after the summer holidays.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you should take the matter of securing another teacher up with the church authorities, and, if you consider this school should be continued, the services of another teacher should be secured. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by the church authorities should be submitted for the consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nCold Lake, Sask.\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nReferring to your letter of the 8th ultimo, No. 115-3-1, I have the honour to report that when at Cold Lake reserve on the 12th instant, I called at the R.C. Mission for the purpose of ascertaining from the Rev. Father Balter, the position with respect to re-opening the Day School at that place.\n\nFather Balter stated that, in his opinion, it was hopeless to try to re-open the school. He pointed out that the Indians of the Chipewyan band are almost entirely hunting Indians, and that they are away from the reserve, following their vocation, for lengthy periods and take their whole family with them, but that they would willingly leave the school children if there was any place at which they could leave them. He also said that when the Day School was first opened, it was with the understanding that the Department would shortly establish a Boarding School on the reserve; and, at first, the Indians made every effort to have their children attend; but, as the prospect of obtaining a Boarding School diminished, the Indians lost heart and made little effort to send their children to the Day School. Father Balter added that should the Department consider building a Boarding School on the reserve, he felt sure that the Sisters of Charity - who were in charge of the Mission and Day School - would come back and re-open the Day School pending the building of a Boarding School.\n\nI may say, in this connection, that there are about 35 children of school age in the Chipewyan band. During the first year the Day School was open, 1916, the average attendance was 27 whilst during the last year the average was 12 only.\n\nIt is a matter of regret that the school is closed and that the Sisters have left. Apart from the school work, their presence on the reserve and their visits to the homes of the Indians, undoubtedly had a good effect; particularly in the case of the Chipewyan women, who are now, noticeably, more clean and tidy in their dress and homes than formerly. However, it appears that nothing can be done just at present towards the re-opening of the Day School. A new Roman Catholic Bishop, in place of the late Archbishop Legal, has been appointed, and Father Balter has not yet been able to communicate with him on the subject.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nExtract from Report of Mr. Inspector W. Murison on the Onion Lake Agency, October 29th to November 16, 1920.\n\nOriginal on 77-115-1\n\n==================\n\nCOLD LAKE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThe day school at this point which was conducted by the Sisters of the Assumption is now closed. Owing to the irregular attendance the sisters became discouraged. A satisfactory attendance cannot be looked for at this point so long as the Indians follow their avocation of hunting and trapping as their chief occupation. The last return shows an enrolment of 19 with an average attendance of three.\n\nW. Murison\n\nInsp.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the Indian Day School at Cold Lake reserve, which has been closed since June 1920. I have the honour to inform you that when at the R.C. Mission at Cold Lake recently, I was informed by Father Balter, the priest in charge there, that the church authorities had written the Department, asking that the school be reopened and Mr. J. H. Lirette, given the position of teacher, and his wife that of Field Matron, and that they be paid a joint salary of $1000.00.\n\nI understand that Mr. Lirette has 15 years teaching experience; that he is the holder of a 1st. Class Certificate for New York State, and a 2nd. Class Certificate for both Manitoba and Alberta. I know Mr. Lirette personally and believe he would be successful as teacher of an Indian Day School if given the position; for some years past he has been keeping a store at Cold Lake, and about a year ago married the daughter of Mr. Z. A. Lefebvre, who was farm instructor at the Cold Lake reserve prior to 1913.\n\nIf the Department has been approached by the church authorities and the re-opening of the Day School at Cold Lake is under consideration, the appointment of Mr. and Mrs. Lirette, as teacher and field matron, respectfully, would have my recommendation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, October 21st, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the re-opening of the Indian Day School at Cold Lake Reserve and the appointment of Mr. J. H. Lirette, as teacher, and his wife as field matron, and requesting that they be paid a joint salary of $1,000.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that no communication has yet reached the Department from the church authorities regarding the re-opening of this school, or the appointment of the above teacher and field matron respectively. In your letter of October 15th, 1920, you stated as follows:\n\n\"I called at the R.C. Mission for the purpose of ascertaining from the Rev. Father Balter the position with respect to the re-opening of the day school at that place. Father Balter stated that in his opinion it would be hopeless to try to re-open the school. He pointed out that the Indians of the Chipewyan Band are almost entirely hunting Indians, and that they are away from the Reserve following their vocation for lengthy periods and take their whole family with them.\"\n\nIn order that the Department may be in a position to consider the request of the church authorities when it is received, I will be pleased if you will furnish a full report as to the attendance that would likely result if this school was re-opened. Particulars should also be forwarded regarding the building in which the school would be conducted, and whether it is in a suitable condition to carry on the work.\n\nIn view of the report submitted by you on October 15th, 1920, it is considered that unless conditions have changed the Department would hardly be warranted in undertaking the expense involved in conducting a school at this point.\n\nYour report on this matter should be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nONION LAKE AGENCY\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE\n\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nNovember 2nd, 1921\n\n559419\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo No. 115-3-1, with reference to the proposed re-opening of the Indian Day School on the Chipewyan reserve at Cold Lake.\n\nAt the census taken recently there were 45 children of school age in the two Chipewyan bands at Cold Lake. Of these 14 are enrolled at the Onion Lake (R.C.) Boarding School, leaving a balance of 31. After deducting from this number all those who for any reason could not attend the Day School it appears to me that an average attendance of 20 is a very conservative estimate, and could reasonably be expected.\n\nI was again at Cold Lake on October 30th, and called upon Father Balter at the Roman Catholic Mission there; he seems very keen and enthusiastic over the prospect of the re-opening of the Day School. Formerly, when the Sisters of Charity were living at the Mission the Indian Day School was held in one of the rooms there which had been enlarged for that purpose. However, since the Sisters have left the Mission building, it has again been used as quarters for the priests, who have given up the building they formerly occupied. This is the building that would now be used for school purposes. The room intended for the classroom is 21 ft. square. The building is a log one, two storied and shingled. It is a good building in every respect, and the remainder of the building would be occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Lirette, if they are appointed teacher and field matron respectively. Father Balter told me that he would expect to be paid the same rental as formerly, i.e. $20.00 per month. At the time of my visit the building was undergoing necessary repairs to the plaster, etc.; it has been unoccupied for the past twelve months.\n\nVery little equipment would be required as there is now on hand at Cold Lake, 20 double school desks, a teacher's desk and two chairs.\n\nI reminded Father Balter that about a year ago he had thought it hopeless to attempt a re-opening of this Day School. He is of the opinion that conditions have now changed (insofar as the sentiment of the Indians towards a Day School is concerned), I agree with him and that if the School is now re-opened it will have a good attendance. This also is my view, and I may add that the chief of the band told me that if the school is re-opened he will use his influence to have all the children attend.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa, November 11, 1921.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 2nd instant, with reference to the proposed re-opening of the Indian day school on the Chipewyan reserve at Cold Lake. I have noted that you believe that there would be an average attendance of twenty if this school were re-opened and that Father Balter of the Roman Catholic Mission is enthusiastic over the prospect of the re-opening of this day school. I understand the nature of the building that would be used for the purpose and the necessity for but little equipment. The Department was pleased to learn of the change in sentiment on the part of the Indians and their present favourable attitude towards a day school at Cold Lake.\n\nIn reply, I beg to state that the Department will consider the re-opening of this school, upon a formal request from the church authorities. You informed us in your communication of the 16th ultimo that the Department was being approached by the church concerning this matter. We are at present in receipt of no communications relative to the re-opening of the Cold Lake day school, and I would suggest that you request Father Balter to again get in touch with his Ecclesiastic Superior, with a view to having this matter brought to our attention.\n\nConcerning the appointment of Mr. J. H. Lirette, as Teacher, and his wife to the position of Field Matron, we will have to ascertain first if these appointments are suitable to the church that is doing missionary work at that point.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nFrom your communications regarding the matter, the Department was convinced that a day school at Cold Lake might be successful, but we are desirous of securing the co-operation of the Roman Catholic church authorities to ensure a supervision of that denomination in addition to our own. As you know, this is the Department policy with respect to the education of our Indian children.\n\nCommunicate with Father Balter, and, when we are in receipt of recommendations from the Roman Catholic church, we will inform you of our action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nLeGoff Alberta,\n22nd October 1921.\n\nTo The Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Can.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe day school of this reserve (Chipewyan Reserve No. 149) has now been closed for over a year. The sisters who had been in charge of this school had been promised a Boarding School, and as the Department have failed to establish said boarding school, the sisters have left.\n\nIt is a well-known fact that day schools are far from being a success, and this is the reason why we have so often urged the Indian Department to open a boarding school here, as there are on this reserve a great number of Chipewyan children who are growing up without any education whatever, and as there are no hopes of getting the boarding school, I have been requested by the Indians to find some teacher to open the day school again, and in view of the fact, I beg to recommend a gentleman Mr. J.H. Lirette, who holds a first-class certificate for teaching in New York State, also certificates for teaching in Manitoba and Alberta. Mr. Lirette has had long experience in teaching and his wife Mrs. Lirette would be a good matron. I would ask you to kindly accept Mr. Lirette to the position; he is willing\nto accept the position at $1,000.00 a year.\n\nHis Lordship Archbishop J.H. O'Leary of Edmonton was here last week, and after talking the matter over with him, he strongly advised me to try to get Mr Lirette to take over the school.\n\nI will be anxiously waiting your reply. Trusting you will give the matter a favourable consideration.\n\nYours obediently\n\n[Signature]\n\nBalto\nOttawa, November 12, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 22nd ultimo with reference to the proposed re-opening of the day school on the Chipewyan reserve at Cold Lake and the appointment of Mr. J. H. Lirette to the position of Teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department is seriously considering offering the Indians on this reserve some school facilities, and, with this in view, we have lately written to Mr. Agent Turner at Onion Lake, asking that you secure the moral support of your Ecclesiastical Superior who, I believe, is His Lordship Archbishop J. H. O'Leary, of Edmonton. If His Lordship will recommend the re-opening of this school, and if both he and yourself assure us of your interest in the matter, and can at that time find a suitable teacher, the Department will give the matter earnest consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nReverend L. Balter,\nLeGoff, Alta.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nMr. myr. might goaded w/o\n2.\n\nHe as well as certificates for Manitoba and Alberta.\n\nMr. Lirette has had years of experience in the teaching profession and his wife, Mrs. Lirette, I am told would make a good matron. Mr. Lirette would accept the position for the sum of $1000.00 annually.\n\nI earnestly hope you will give this matter your most kind consideration.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nArchbishop of Edmonton.\nTo The Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe school for day scholars of Chipewyan Reserve No. I49 has now been closed for over a year. The sisters who had been in charge of this school for some time, had been promised a boarding school, and as the department of Indian Affairs has not established it, the sisters have left, for want of resources to carry on.\n\nIt is a well-known fact that day schools are far from being a complete success among the Indians. This, I believe, is the reason why The Rev. Father Balter has so often urged your department to open a Boarding school on the above-mentioned Reserve. There are, I am told, a great number of Chipewyan children growing up without any education whatever and, if there be no chance for the opening of the boarding-school, I am requested to ask you to allow the day-school to be reopened.\n\nFor the position as teacher I would recommend Mr. J. H. Lirette who holds a first-class teacher's certificate for New York.\nOTTAWA, Nov. 26th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 11th instant and previous correspondence regarding the re-opening of the Indian day school on the Chipewyan Reserve, at Cold Lake, I beg to say that a communication has been received from His Grace The Archbishop of Edmonton requesting that this school be re-opened, and recommending that Mr. J. H. Lirette be appointed teacher and his wife assistant, and to perform matron's duties on the Reserve.\n\nIn view of your report as to the attendance that would result, and also in view of the request of the church authorities, it has been decided to authorize the re-opening of this school, from the first of the new year. The classes can be conducted in the Mission Building, in the room formerly used for the purpose. The Department will allow the church authorities a rental for the use of the building at the rate of $20.00 per month, which is also to include the heating and caretaking. You should arrange with the church authorities to have the classroom ready for occupation by the first of the new year. The rent and salary of the teacher will be paid from that time, upon receipt of the usual quarterly return of attendance, and certified vouchers covering the amount of rent due.\n\nThe salary allowed Mr. Lirette as teacher will be at the rate of $650 per annum, and his wife, who is appointed as assistant to the teacher, will be paid at the rate of $350 per annum, - a combined salary of $1,000 per annum.\n\nIt is expected that Mrs. Lirette, besides assisting in any duties which she is called upon to perform in the classroom, will also undertake matron's duties on the Reserve. She should visit the Indians' homes and instruct the women in general housekeeping, and in the cleanliness of their homes, and the care of their children. She should also visit any cases of sickness on the Reserve.\n\nIt is noted by your letter of the 2nd instant that very little equipment will be needed to fit up the classroom, as there are sufficient desks for the pupils and teachers.\n\nYou should inform Mr. and Mrs. Lirette of their appointment, and arrange with them to begin duties as soon as possible after the new year. Both His Grace The Archbishop of Edmonton and the Rev. Father Balter have been informed of the re-opening of this school and the appointment and salary allowed Mr. and Mrs. Lirette.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nI might further add that Mrs. Lirette's title will be \"Assistant to the Teacher\". This is to overcome the necessity of applying to the Civil Service Commission for the classification and establishment of a position for her as field matron.\n\nYou should inform the Department later as to the date on which Mr. and Mrs. Lirette began duties.\n\nA requisition should be forwarded for any school material, such as books, etc., and same will be sent through the Government Stationery Office.\n\nYou will be good enough to give these teachers any assistance you can in their work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nOTTAWA, Nov. 26th, 1921.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the re-opening of the Indian day school on the Chipewyan Reserve at Cold Lake, and recommending that Mr. J. H. Lirette be appointed teacher, and his wife as assistant to the teacher, and to perform other duties on the Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of our Agent's report as to the number of children that would likely attend, and that a suitable classroom can be provided in the Mission Building, and also in view of the request of Your Grace and the Reverend L. Balter, the Department is authorizing the re-opening of this school on the first of the new year.\n\nThe appointment of Mr. J. H. Lirette as teacher at a salary of $650 per annum is approved, as is also that of his wife as assistant to the teacher, and to perform duties as field matron on the Reserve, in visiting the Indians' homes and instructing the women in general housekeeping and the cleanliness of their homes and the care of their children. She should also visit any cases of sickness on the Reserve. The salary allowed Mrs. Lirette will be at the rate of $350 per annum. This will allow a combined salary for both services at the rate of $1,000 per annum.\n\nThe Department will also allow a rental for the use of the building for classroom purposes at the rate of $20.00 per month; it being understood that this amount will include the necessary heating and caretaking.\n\nI might add that our Acting Agent, Mr. Lang Turner, has been informed of the Department's decision, and instructed to have the necessary arrangements made in order that Mr. and Mrs. Lirette can begin duties after the new year.\n\nIt is hoped that this school will meet with every success and that there will be a good and regular attendance of Indian children of school age on the Reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be, Your Grace's\n\nMost Obedient Servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. J. H. Lirette is appointed teacher, at a salary of $650 per annum, and his wife as assistant to the teacher, and besides any duties in the classroom, she is to undertake matron's duties on the Reserve. She should visit the Indians' homes, and instruct the women in general housekeeping and in the cleanliness of their homes and the care of their children. She should also visit any cases of sickness on the Reserve. Mrs. Lirette should forward a report through the Agent from time to time on the duties she is performing. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $350 per annum. This will provide a combined salary of $1,000.\n\nThe Department will allow a rental for the use of the building for classroom purposes at the rate of $20.00 per month; it being understood that this amount will include the necessary heating and caretaking.\n\nIt is hoped that the classroom can be made ready by the first of the new year, and that Mr. and Mrs. Lirette will take up duties as soon as possible after that date. It is also hoped that this school will meet with every success and that there will be a good and regular attendance of the Indian children of school age on the Reserve.\n\nOur Acting Agent, Mr. Lang Turner, has been informed in accordance with the above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

H. Lirette has been appointed teacher, at a salary of $650 per annum, and his wife assistant to the teacher. Besides any necessary duties in the classroom, she is also to undertake matron's duties on the Reserve. The salary allowed Mrs. Lirette will be at the rate of $350 per annum.\n\nThe rent allowed for the use of the building for classroom purposes is $20.00 per month, which includes the heating and caretaking.\n\nIt is the intention to re-open this school at the beginning of the new year. The Agent states that there will be an average of 20 children that could reasonably be expected to attend.\n\nMr. Lang Turner, Acting Indian Agent, has been informed accordingly as well as the church authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It had been arranged that Mr. and Mrs. Lirette should occupy the mission building in which the schoolroom is situated. However, Mr. Lirette now informed me that as he had not yet been able to dispose of his store business (vide my letter of October 15th, even number) he would be unable to live at the school for about three months, by which time he expects to dispose of his business. In the meantime he would travel to and from the school, night and morning.

You should also state whether Mr. Lirette's efforts to dispose of his business will interfere with his duties as teacher. If the plans he has made will not interfere with the work, the Department has no objection to the arrangement made to reside at a distance from the school and travel to and from work each day.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Lirette, told me that he thought he would resign when the school closed for the summer holiday but that he would let me know later. It appears that Mr. Lirette's brother is settled in Fort McMurray and is doing well there and wishes his brother to join him.\n\nOn my visit to Cold Lake reserve a few days ago for the purpose of making treaty payments, I called upon Father Balter at the R.C. Mission, and he told me that Mr. Lirette had left for Fort McMurray and did not intend to come back to Cold Lake. The Rev. Father asked me to report this to the Department as he understood that application was being made to the Department for the position.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA, July 26th, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, informing the Department that Mr. J.

Father Balter is endeavouring to secure the services of a teacher to succeed Mr. Lirette. If possible, the services of a married man should be secured. The man to perform the duties of teacher, and his wife that of assistant to the teacher, and, besides any duties she may perform in the classroom, she could also undertake matron's duties on the Reserve.\n\nIt is hoped that competent persons can be secured for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The reasons set forth are the following:\n\na) The children on the reserve have a right to education according to the treaties;\n\nb) The Department of Indian Affairs having studied the question before the war had reached the conclusion that a boarding school was a necessity. The construction was delayed by the war but now as before the circumstances have not changed and the same necessity (if not greater) is still existing;\n\nc) The day school in spite of the good will of the Indians cannot give satisfactory results. It is true a certain number of children draw a little benefit from the school but the Department is aware that our Indians live in the woods most of the time, hunting, etc. They necessarily bring their children along. Even when the Indians stay on the reserve as the latter is very large it is almost cruel to ask from the children to attend school regularly during Winter. Kindly note also that there is a small reserve situated at 15 miles from Legoff and the children can in no way attend school.\n\nd) There is a boarding school at Onion Lake but the Montagnais are reluctant to send their children to that school for the following reasons:\n\nI-The distance which is 80 miles;\n\nII-The Montagnais though desiring that their children learn English insist that they learn their prayers in their own dialect. At Onion Lake the prayers are said in English and in Cree.\n\nIII-Even if these inconveniences did not\nexist the school of Onion Lake being overcrowded\nthe children of Cold Lake Reserve would find no\nplace for them.\n\nI leave all these facts to your\njudgment and make the request for the erection\nof a boarding school on Cold Lake Reserve.\n\nJoseph [signature]\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report the receipt of a letter from Mr. X. P. Crispo, Provincial School Inspector, Alberta, reading as follows:\n\n\"There are five children who would like to be admitted to the Indian school at Cold Lake, and as this seems to be the only means of providing school facilities for these children, I should be pleased were you to inform me if arrangements can be made to admit them. If an arrangement is possible will you kindly state the terms, financial, or otherwise.\"\n\nI have not yet had an opportunity of ascertaining the views held by Mr. Hebert, the school teacher, with respect to this, but if he has no objection to teaching these extra pupils, and the Department will allow them to attend the Indian Day School at Cold Lake, I do not know of any objection to their attendance. There is ample room for these extra children at the school, and, if the Department agrees to allow them to attend, I would suggest that a fee of $1.00 per month for each child be charged the parents or guardians.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 14th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, regarding the request made by the Provincial School Inspector that school facilities be provided for five children at the Cold Lake Indian Day School, as there is no school in the vicinity at which they could attend.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department would have no objection to granting permission for these five children to attend the Indian day school provided there is accommodation for them, and they would not interfere with the instruction given the Indian children, and, also, provided the teacher would consent to give them instruction.\n\nRegarding the fees to be charged, this is a matter that will be left to yourself and the teacher, as it is considered, if the teacher will agree to perform the work necessary in giving them instruction, the fees should go to him. The sum mentioned by you, viz: $1.00 per month for each child, to be paid by the parents or guardians, should be a fair rate to charge for the privilege of providing educational facilities for their children. These five children should only be permitted to attend if such attendance will not in any way interfere with the regular classroom work of the Indian children, and if the teacher will agree to accept them in view of the fees which he will receive from the parents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

If the Department can see its way to giving Mr. Hebert an increase in salary, it would carry my recommendation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 15, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing a communication from Mr. Chas. P. Hebert, teacher of the Cold Lake Indian Day School, in which, for the reasons stated, he applies for an increase in salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that, in view of the reports received from the Public School Inspector and yourself regarding the work Mr. Hebert is performing in the classroom, it has been decided to allow him an increase of $100 in his salary from the 1st instant. This will make his salary from that date at the rate of $750 per annum, payment of which is based on ten teaching months in the year. In addition to salary, he will be entitled to bonus provided by law, which, during the present fiscal year, is at the rate of $15 per month for the ten teaching months. I would point out that the above increase will provide a total salary and bonus of $1400 to Mr. and Mrs. Hebert, and this is the total amount which we have available for salaries at this school.\n\nPlease inform Mr. Hebert of the increase of $100 per annum allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Hebert, teacher of the Cold Lake Indian Day School, an increase of $100 per annum in his salary from the 1st instant. This increase has been made on his application, and in view of the excellent reports that have been received from the Public School Inspector and the Indian Agent as to the work he is performing in the classroom. This will make his salary from the above date at the rate of $750 per annum, which will be supplemented by the bonus provided by law.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

However, as you have signed the return it is presumed that you agree with the teacher and payment is being allowed to him for the three months of July, August and September and two months holidays should be taken during the winter, as the Department can only allow salary for ten teaching months in the present school year, which ends June 30th, next.\n\nPlease advise during what month the holidays will be taken at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake,\nSASK.\nLegoff Alta, Sept 9th, 1925.\n\nTo His Grace H.J.O'Leary,\nthe Lord Archbishop of Edmonton.\n\nYour Grace,\n\nAt several times in the past we have petitioned the Indian Department for the construction of a boarding school and hospital on the Cold Lake Reserve.\n\nThe Department of Indian affairs having studied the question before the war, had reached the conclusion that a Boarding School and a Hospital was a necessity. The construction was delayed by the war, but now as before the circumstances have not changed and the same necessity (if not greater) is still existing.\n\nAs far as the Boarding School is concerned the children on the two Reserves have a right to education according to the treaties. The Day School in spite of the good will of the Indians cannot give satisfactory results. It is true a certain number of children draw a little benefit from the Day School, but the Department is aware that the Chipewyan Indians live in the woods most of the time, hunting etc. They necessarily bring their children along. Even when the Indians stay on the Reserve as the latter is very large it is almost cruel to ask the children to attend school regularly especially during the winter. Kindly note also that there is a small reserve situated at 15 miles from Legoff and the children can in no way attend school.\n\nReferring to the construction of a hospital, I beg to inform Your Grace that for a few years past mortality seems to have been more marked among the Chipewyan Indians than on other Reserves. According to the Doctors themselves (Dr. Charlebois, Dr. Hill, Dr. Sabourin), in most cases this work has been handicapped for want of a hospital, the Indians as a rule not being able to give remedies according to prescriptions. At the present time the Indians have to transport their patients 30 miles, from here to Bonnyville Hospital. It is easy to realize the inconvenience of such a situation.\n\nThat is why Your Grace I believe will justify...\nARCHBISHOP'S RESIDENCE\n8317 105TH STREET\nEDMONTON, ALBERTA\n\nSeptember 16th, 1925.\n\nMr. Scott,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI enclose you the copy of a letter sent to me by Reverend Father Balter. I personally visited this district last week and have ascertained that his claims are absolutely justified.\n\nI therefore appeal to you to take up this matter as soon as possible. May I also request you to see that the money is voted for the new School in Saddle Lake which is quite imperative.\n\nWith sentiments of esteem and sincere best wishes,\n\nI am,\n\nSincerely yours\n\nArchbishop of Edmonton.\nOttawa, Sept. 23, 1925.\n\nDear Archbishop O'Leary:\n\nI have Your Grace's letter of the 16th instant, enclosing a copy of a communication from the Rev. Father Balter. There are many pressing claims upon the Appropriation for Indian Education and I am not hopeful that funds will be provided for the construction of an Indian residential school at Cold Lake in the near future. The replacement and enlarging of the present building at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School has already been urged by Your Grace and others, and, when future estimates are being prepared, the claims of this reserve will not be overlooked.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

I refer to the school requirements for the Indians of this Agency and part of the Onion Lake Agency, viz.: Keewehins Reserve. In my opinion, the question of building a school on the Saddle Lake Agency should not be considered. The school should be built at St. Paul de Metis, and should be sufficiently large to accommodate not only the children of the Saddle Lake Reserve, but of Cold Lake and Keeheewins reserves as well. I believe that a school of the same capacity as that which we have built for the Roman Catholic Church on the Blood Reserve would meet the requirements.\n\nI understand that the church authorities are anxious to have a school built at Cold Lake as well as at Saddle Lake. This would be a mistake, as a school centrally located would take care of the requirements of Saddle Lake and a great part of the Onion Lake Agency. Of course, if this scheme is carried out, and I think it should be, the Department should insist on closing up the day schools. In my opinion, the operating of these schools is only a useless waste of money, for which we are getting no value.\n\nI believe that the establishing of a school at St. Paul de Metis will meet with the approval of the Archbishop of Edmonton, and the Oblate Order.\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham.\nOttawa, October 28, 1926.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to a portion of your 407-7 B of the 16th instant, in which you recommend that a residential school be erected at St. Paul de Metis. I note that such a school would not only replace the worn out buildings at the Blue Quills Institution, but would provide residential facilities for the children of the Cold Lake and Assiniboine Reserves. A note has been made for future Estimates in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nI am compelled to address myself to you on the following questions.\n\nI have been teaching here for five years. Have asked for more fuel to heat the school. Receive only $10 a year. The last five years have cost me an average of $70 not including $30 allowance. Thus I had to pay from my own pocket. I understand that many day schools receive as far as $170 for fuel. Is there any reason why I should be limited to a little $10 a year.\n\n(2) Nothing is furnished on the line of midday meal except biscuits. When bacon, rice, rolled oats etc could be given, attendance was very much better. Is there no way of giving these poor little Indian children a better meal at noon?\n\n(3) It was made to understand when I first came here that if I gave satisfaction my salary would be raised. I have asked for that raise Mr. Crepo, the school insp., has recommended me in his report, but no raise has come.\nI hate to ask, yet I am told that the dept. gives very little unless it is urgently asked for. I like my position, my work and the Indians. Never had the least trouble with any of them. Still I don't like to see school teachers gain a salary of 12 to 16 hundred a year in the province while I receive only $750. You see very well Mr. Stewart that it is not much for a teacher who now has 15 years of experience in Alberta.\n\nI therefore rely upon your kindness and hope that through your influence these three questions shall be advantageously settled.\n\nI remain sincerely yours,\n\nChas P.

In connection with the fuel allowance, I wish to point out that the Department made an agreement with the local missionary to the effect that the rental of $20 per teaching month should include the necessary heating and caretaking. Accordingly, your request for an increased fuel allowance should be made to Rev. Father Lacombe. With reference to the midday lunch, I have to inform you that on the 26th ultimo, following receipt of Mr. Inspector Morrison's report, the Department authorized an expenditure of $5 per month during the winter months so that some beef, beans, tea, etc., could be provided.\n\nWhen you were appointed in 1922, you were allowed salary at the rate of $500 for the ten teaching months, and, in addition, Mrs. Hebert was allowed $200 per annum for her services as field matron. It is true that you have given satisfaction, and in 1924 an increase of $100 was allowed in your case.\n\nIn your letter to Mr. Stewart, you leave the impression that your salary has never been increased since your appointment and that at present it is only $350 for the ten teaching months. May I point out that you are in receipt of $900, and when the salary of Mrs. Hebert is added thereto, it makes a total of $1400, which I feel compared quite favourable with remuneration paid to workers in rural day schools in the province.\n\nI am pleased to inform you that, in harmony with the Department's practice to recognize satisfactory services, I have directed that an increase of $50 be granted in your case as from the 1st of September, next.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Shepersky, of Cold Lake, Alta., I wish to report that it is true the day school which the Department conducts for the Indian children of the Cold Lake reserve is only partly meeting the demands of the situation. Archbishop O'Leary, at one time, asked the Department to provide a boarding school and hospital for the Indians of Cold Lake. His Grace and the Oblate Order have been given to understand that the proposed institution near St. Paul de Matin will be large enough to accommodate the Roman Catholic children of, not only the Saddle Lake reserve, but also those from the Keechewins and Cold Lake reserves. This arrangement is, apparently, satisfactory to the church authorities. A farm and building site are now being transferred to this Department for the new institution, and the Main Estimates provide $50,000 to commence the building activity.\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, March 16, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Shapersky:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, urging the establishment of an Indian residential school on the Gold Lake reserve. The Department realizes that boarding schools are best suited to the needs of the Indian children of Alberta; but it is not practical to have such an institution on each reserve. At the present time, I am contemplating a large new school for Roman Catholic Indian children near St. Paul de Metis. A building site and farm have been secured and it is proposed to commence the erection of the buildings this year. This proposed school is for the children of the Saddle Lake, Gold Lake, Koesesin and Frog Lake reserves and will likely be ready for pupils some time next year. Children of the Gold Lake Indian reserve, who are unable to attend the day school regularly, will be eligible for admission to the new school near St. Paul de Metis.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. F. R. Shapersky,\nGold Lake,\nAlta.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR MURISON,\nDATED OCTOBER 15, 1929, ON HIS VISIT TO\nTHE COLD LAKE RESERVE.\n\nCOLD LAKE RESERVE.\n\nA number of Indians waited for me at the Mission where I stopped for lunch. Included in the number was Chief Jumbo from the Big Island Lake Reserve, and their chief object in seeing me was to again agitate for a residential school on their reserve. They claim that they were promised a school before the war and each time I visit the reserve they bring up this question, and they have it so firmly fixed in their minds that it does not appear as though they will cease agitating until they get what they are asking for. The Chief from Island Lake endorsed the request and stated that all the members of his Band would send their children to Cold Lake, but that Onion Lake was too far and hard for them to reach.\n\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MR. COMMISSIONER GRAHAM,\nDATED OCTOBER 19, 1929, ENCLOSING INSPECTOR\nMURISON'S REPORT.\n\nYou will note that the Indians of the Cold Lake Reserve are making a request to be supplied with a residential school. In my opinion the Department would be making a serious mistake if they were to build a school at this point. We have all the schools in this part of the country that we need, especially if we build one at St. Paul de Metis.\nCOLD LAKE DAY SCHOOL.\n\nI called at this school on October 10th. I have already reported upon the classroom, which is in the old Priest's house, a proportion of which is also used as a residence for the teacher. This is not an attractive or suitable building for school purposes and can only be classed as a makeshift.\n\nThere are\n\nCOLD LAKE DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThere are only 5 Indian children on the roll so far for this quarter, 2 boys and 3 girls. In addition to these, 3 children who belong to the Farming Instructor and 2 belonging to the teacher are also attending. Mr. Chas. Hebert, the teacher, has good qualifications, but it would be very difficult for any teacher to make a showing with the conditions as they are regarding attendance.\n\nI noted that some swings and a teeter have been erected in the playground.\nRegina, Sask., Oct. 19, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith a report of an inspection made at the various schools in the Onion Lake Agency.\n\nI do not think the Department would be well advised in spending any money on the erection of new buildings for a Day school in this agency. The time will come when there will be a residential school built at Saddle Lake and the children from Cold Lake should go to this school, or to a school of the same denomination at Onion Lake. I think you will agree with me in this matter.\n\nW. M. Graham.\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nCOLD LAKE INDIAN RESERVE\nOnion Lake Agency\n\nLEGOFF, Alta.\nOctober 31st, 1929\n\nThe Honourable Charles Stewart,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nHonourable Sir:\n\nWe, the undersigned Indians of the Cold Lake Reserve respectfully beg you to take into serious consideration our often reiterated demand for the establishment of a Boarding School on our own Reserve here... Your predecessors have repeatedly promised us such a school... We were once on the point of having it, but the World War forced the Indian Department to postpone the erection of that school... Since then, the Indian Reserve Inspectors, our Agents, our Ecclesiastical Superiors have been unanimous in supporting our just demand, and in promising us a Boarding School... Sad to say!! After so many years of anxious and patient expectation, we seem to be still at the same point.\n\nWe want higher education for our children, and we want it given here on our Reserve. We shall never consent to sending our children to the proposed St-Paul school, and our sending them presently to Onion Lake, is, and was always intended to be, a temporary arrangement.\n\nWe were promised a Boarding School before it was even a question of rebuilding the Onion Lake Anglican and Catholic schools; and before there was any talk of reorganising the Saddle Lake school. Are we going to wait until all the old Boarding Schools of the West are rebuilt, before we are given our own school, which was promised us since so many years??\n\nWe feel that our rights are slighted, that somebody, somewhere, is playing with us, and we resent it very deeply!\n\nTherefore, Honourable and Kind Sir, we once more entreat you most respectfully, but also most energetically, to reconsider our request, and to give this our school question the earliest possible solution.\n\nWe consider that our school ought to be the first on the list of the boarding schools to be built in 1930.\n\nShould you deign to grant us our just demand (you have the power to do it) we shall forever be most grateful to you, and we shall pray the Lord to bestow upon you and those dear to you His most precious Blessings.\n\nAlphonse Woull\u00e9, ex Chief.\nSamuel Janvier, Counsellor\nAlphonse Pich\u00e9, Counsellor\nHarry Janvier, Counsellor\nStanislas Nest\nJ.B.

Charles Stewart, which I received under cover of one from the Rev. Father Lacombe, at Cold Lake, with a request that I forward it to Mr. Stewart. However, it seems proper that this should be transmitted through your hands.\n\nWith regard to the request of the Cold Lake Indians for a Residential School, I beg to say that the facts are as stated in the letter. These Indians were made to believe that they were on the point of having a Residential School erected just before the outbreak of the World War; and, since the war, at every meeting of the band at which the Inspector and myself have been present, they have always brought up the subject, and appear to feel very keenly about it.\n\nI may say that the number of children of school age belonging to this band is, approximately 60. This number includes those at present attending the Onion Lake Residential School and the Cold Lake Indian Day, which is, respectively, 39 and 13.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNovember 21, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Turner:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing a petition from the Indians of the Cold Lake Reserve, addressed to the Honourable Charles Stewart. You may inform those interested that the establishment of an Indian residential school on this reserve has been before the Department for some time; but that it is not practical to have such an institution on each reserve. I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to this request. The parents of the Cold Lake Indian Reserve should be given to understand that the new school, which it is proposed to erect at St. Paul, is partly for their children.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOnion Lake, Sask., March 11, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report for the month of February past.\n\nIndian Day School on the reserve. (Cold Lake Reserve)\n\nThis was discussed at some length as these people are most anxious for a day school. They claim they have twenty children of school age who have never had any tuition and they requested me to report this situation to the Department.\n\nJ. Hill, M.D.\nST. LAWRENCE DAY SCHOOL, COLD LAKE RES.\n\nI visited this school on the 29th of April. Mr. Charles Hebert is still in charge as teacher. There are 14 children on the roll, 7 of whom are Indian children. On the day of my visit there were 6 present. Five of the children belong to the Farming Instructor and the teacher, and there was one Indian child only in attendance. The attendance of the Indian children is very irregular, and so far as this school being a means of providing an education for Indian children is concerned, it is useless and only a means of excuse for not sending them to the residential schools. The Indians of this band all engage at trapping and hunting, and this pursuit takes them away from their reserve a great deal.\nST. LAWRENCE DAY SCHOOL, COLD LAKE RES. (CONT'D.)\n\ngreat deal and they take their families along with them. Even when they are residing on the reserve, they are indifferent about sending their children to school. There is no change in conditions, insofar as the classroom and teacher's residence, which is in the same building, are concerned. I believe that Mr. Hebert is a well qualified teacher, but he has not a chance to show what he can do under the present conditions.\n\nW. Morrison\nEXTRACT from Report of Mr. Indian Agent Turner for the Month of October, 1931, regarding the COLD LAKE INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 115-3-7.\n\nAt this school there are thirteen half-breed children attending, ten of whom were present at the time of my visit. The teacher informed me that the local police officer had called on him and asked him to allow these children to attend the school.\nOttawa, November 16, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to your report on the Cold Lake Indian Day School for the month of October last. It is noted that there are 15 half-breed children attending. The last return received from this school, for the quarter ended September 30, 1931, shows an enrolment of 25 pupils. We are not aware whether this number included the half-breeds in attendance.\n\nIt is considered, in view of the number of half-breed and also children of the farming instructor and teacher, who, we understand attend, that the Provincial authorities should be responsible for part of the cost of maintaining the school. In several instances we have combined white and Indian schools, the municipality or the Provincial Government paying part of the cost. If there is a school section organized in this locality, would it not be possible to arrange with them or with the Provincial Government to pay part of the cost of the teacher's salary and other maintenance charges? I would point out that this Department is under no responsibility for the education of half-breeds or white children.\n\nI would be pleased to have a report from you, giving your views regarding the conducting of a combined school for the Indian, half-breed and white children in the neighbourhood of the Cold Lake School. In forwarding your report, please state the total number of Indian children who could attend and also the number of half-breed and white children in the neighbourhood, who are at present attending.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOmien Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, December 17, 1923.\n\nRight Reverend Monsignor:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to an Indian residential school at Cold Lake. His Grace Archbishop O'Leary and others have pressed for the establishment of a school near St. Paul. It is hoped it will be possible to commence the erection of the buildings next summer. This institution is for the children of the Saddle Lake, Cold Lake, Keeheewin and Preg Lake Reserves.\n\nIt is not practical to have a residential school on each Indian reserve, and the Cold Lake Indians should be informed that their children will be eligible for admission to the new school to be erected near St. Paul.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Right Reverend Monsignor J. C. McGuigan, V. G.,\nArchbishop's Residence,\nEdmonton,\nAlta.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of the 16th ultimo, No. 115-3-1, addressed to Mr. Turner re Cold Lake Indian Day School. Mr. Turner, as you are aware, is on six months sick leave.\n\nI visited Cold Lake reserve on the 16th instant, when I inspected the children attending the day school. There were ten in attendance, viz., three Indians, five whites and two breeds. There are 49 children enrolled, of which 25 are Indians, 17 are breeds and the remaining 7, (whites) are the children of the school teacher and farm instructor. These breed children come from unorganised districts south, east and west of the Indian day school, and the nearest organized school and school district, (Beaver Crossing) is six miles further north. It is quite obvious that the Province should assist in the maintenance of this school and I am writing the Provincial Department of Education, at Edmonton, Alberta, by this mail, explaining the situation.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOttawa, December 29, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, regarding the attendance at the Cold Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that of an enrolment of 49 children, 25 only are Indians, 17 others being half-breeds and 7 white children. It is also noted that you are taking up with the Provincial Department of Education, Edmonton, the question of their assisting in the maintenance costs of the school. When you have had a reply, I shall be pleased to have a further report as to what action the Provincial Department is prepared to take in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nThe Indian Office,\nOnion Lake,\nSask.\nOnion Lake Agency\n\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nJanuary 25, 1932.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of yours of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the white and half-breed children attending the Cold Lake Indian Day School.\n\nThe white children, as I previously stated, belong to the school teacher and farm instructor.\n\nThe parents of the half-breed children live south, east and west of the reserve. Some of them have no fixed abode, being transients or squatters, and I am quite certain there are not sufficient at any one point to justify the organization of a school district, and if it were possible to justify a school at one of these points it would hardly serve them all. I am told very few are on homestead land, but all are a reasonable distance from our school.\n\nThe fact remains that they are attending our school and being educated, and consequently we are doing the work which your Department may not feel justified in undertaking, hence the co-operation asked for in my previous letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. T. Hill,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nJ. H. Ross, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Education,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your favour of the 21st instant in which you advise me that there are 25 Indians, 17 breeds and 7 white children attending the Cold Lake Indian Day School, and that the Federal Government is supporting this school but feels no responsibility for the education of the white children and the half-breed children.\n\nThe white children belong to families of the employees of the Federal Government, and in my opinion the Federal Government should be responsible for the education of these children, or at least should allow these children to attend the school they are operating on the Reserve.\n\nIn regard to the half-breed children I wish to say that when there is a sufficient number of them in any unorganized territory the Department of Education will feel justified in organizing a school district and placing it on the same basis as the other school districts throughout the Province. If there is not a sufficient number in any one place to justify organizing a school district the Department does not undertake to pay any part of the expenses of the parents who send their children to a private school.\n\nThere is, however, a Correspondence Branch in connection with this Department, that carries on the correspondence work in the grades from one to eight inclusive without cost to the parents. These half-breed children could enroll in these classes.\n\nWould you kindly advise me whether or not these children are located at any one point where a school district could be formed and all these children educated. I do not know of any case where the Federal Government and the Provincial Government have come to an understanding with regard to the education of half-breed children or white children on a reservation. I would also like to know whether these pupils live near the school or whether they are living on homestead land outside of the Indian reservation, and if there is a sufficient number in any one place to justify the Department in organizing a school district.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. J.

R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nThe Indian Office,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, in which you advise me that the white children referred to in your former letter live on the Indian Reserve, and are the children of the school teacher and farm instructor, and that the half-breed children live at times in the east, west or south of the Reserve.\n\nThe logical place, therefore to have the children educated, is in the Indian School on the Reserve, if the Superintendent of Indian Schools will grant them permission to attend that school. The Reserve is owned by the Federal Government and administered by officials of the Federal Government, and the Department of Education cannot justify using the funds of the Province to support schools that are not under its jurisdiction. It would appear that the attendance of these pupils does not interfere seriously with the operation of the school, and the teacher will be able to do just as satisfactory work unless their presence necessitates the opening of new classes.\n\nI am of the opinion that this is not a case in which the Department of Education has any provision in the Act giving it authority to open up a school on the Reserve or to assist by a grant the financing of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister\n\nMr. J.

BUSKARD,\n\nReferring to your note of the 23rd instant, with regard to Mr. Charles P. Hebert, teacher of the Cold Lake Indian Day School, Le Goff, Alta., I have to say:\n\n1. Mr. Hebert possesses a second class professional certificate for the province of Alberta.\n\n2. He is in receipt of salary at the rate of $55 per teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year.\n\n3. The average attendance for the first three months of this year, as shown by the quarterly return received was 4 Indian children, 3 white (children of Mr. Hebert) and 2 half-breed children. The teacher stated that very few Indian children were left on the reserve, as the Indians were compelled to go north to their hunting grounds. The return for the 3 months period ending June 30th, last, shows an enrollment of 25 Indian children with an average attendance of 12.\n\n4. We receive no returns showing the attendance for any one day or the number of days on which there were no pupils in attendance. This information is kept by the teacher in his daily register of attendance and could be obtained if required.\n\n5. Mr. Hebert receives salary at the rate of $50 per teaching month, less 10% during the present fiscal year. She assists in the preparation of the pupils' midday meal, instructs the girls in sewing, mending, knitting and cooking and is also expected to visit the Indian homes on the reserve.\n\n6. A grant of $5 per month is allowed during the winter months - November 1st to March 31st - to purchase beef for the midday meal. Mr. J. T. Hill, Acting Indian Agent, forwards an account for payment each month. This beef has lately been purchased from C. H. Ross, Le Goff, Alta., at 8\u00a2 per pound. Besides, the following are purchased with the regular yearly contract supplies and forwarded to the school, viz.: 700 lbs. biscuits, 75 lbs. rice, 36 lbs. drinilk and 240 lbs. rolled oats.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nNovember 9, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Murison:\n\nWhen you visited the Department in March last, you intimated that it might be advisable to close the Cold Lake Indian Day School. The attendance at this school is comparatively small, and, in the March quarter, especially, very few children attend. Would it not be possible to arrange to have the children attending this school enrolled at one of the residential schools? I understand that the Blue Quills Residential School requires more pupils. Please let me have a complete report in connection with this matter as soon as possible, and, if you recommend that it be closed, you should state the date on which such action should be taken.\n\nThe present teacher has been in the employ of the Department for 10 years, and you might let me know what chance there is of his securing employment at one of the residential schools. I find, from a memorandum on file in the Department, that you consider Mr. Hebert is well qualified and would make a splendid officer at a residential school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nNovember 7, 1932.\n\nDR. MCGILL,\n\nThe Minister has been informed that two schools on the Indian Reserve at Cold Lake\u2014one at Ireland Lake and the other at LeGoff\u2014could be closed as a measure of economy. It is represented that from January to April 1932 no pupils attended at LeGoff and that the other schools in the Cold Lake district are practically in the same position, and that any pupils involved could be economically transferred to the school at Onion Lake.\n\nThe Minister would like a statement covering the attendance at Ireland Lake and LeGoff during the first six months of the calendar year of 1932, and also a report as to the attendance during the same period at other schools in the Cold Lake district.\n\nWill you also let him have the benefit of your view as to the advisability of closing the schools at Ireland Lake and LeGoff and transferring the pupils to the Onion Lake school.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nNovember 9, 1932.\n\nMemorandum\n\nHONOURABLE THOMAS G. MURPHY\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 7th instant, I may say that I have been unable to identify the school to which your correspondent refers as \"Ireland Lake\". We have no school by this name.\n\nThe only school conducted by this Department on the Cold Lake reserve is known as the \"Cold Lake Indian Day School\", which is situated two miles from Legoff, Alberta. The quarterly returns received from this school show the following attendance:\n\n| Enrolment | Average |\n|-----------|---------|\n| Quarter ended March 31, 1932 | 6        |\n|           |         |\n| \"         | June 30, 1932 | 22       |\n\nThe above figures give the attendance of Indian children only. In addition to them, the school was attended by three whites (children of the teacher) and children from two half-breed families.\n\nI am requesting Inspector Murison to report regarding this school, with a view to determining if it could be closed and the children attending it enrolled at a residential school.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nthree miles of the Railway station at St. Paul de Metis, and,\nas there is a direct line from there to Bonnyville, twenty-five\nmiles South of the Reserve, this would not entail any great\ndifficulty so far as transportation is concerned. There are\nat present over thirty children from this Reserve attending\nthe R. C. Residential School at Onion Lake.\n\nWith reference to the Teacher, Mr. C. Hebert,\nhe has a First Class Teacher's Certificate for the Province of\nAlberta and appears to be bright and well qualified. I do not\nknow of any opening at a residential school which he might fill,\nbut this matter might be taken up with the principals of the\nschools.\n\nI wish however to bring to your attention the fact\nthat the Rev. Father Gauthier has had a day school in operation\nfor some time at Joseph Bigheads which is being operated by the\nChurch. He has provided a frame building 24' x 24' with 10' walls\nand a rubberoid cottage roof. Thirty pupils are enrolled, eleven\nboys and nineteen girls; twenty-five attending regularly. Mrs.\nR. Martineau, an ex-pupil of the Fort Resolution School, has been\nacting in the capacity of teacher. She had a Grade 8 standing at\nthe time of her discharge. It has occurred to me that, if the\nDepartment would give favorable consideration to recognizing this\nschool, Mr. Hebert might take over the duties as teacher, but I\nquestion at this time of year if he could get suitable housing\naccommodation for himself and family. I was on the point of\nreporting this matter to you when I received your letter, in as\nmuch as Father Gauthier has requested me to ask the Department for\ncertain equipment as well as recognition of his school. At the\ntime of my visit Mr. Hebert was anticipating that the Cold Lake\nDay School might be closed, but of course I could not give him\nany information as I did not know what the attitude of the\nDepartment would be, but he stated that in the event of the\nschool being closed he would endeavour to obtain a school else-\nwhere. In any event I see no need for continuing to pay for Mrs.\nHebert's services. It has appeared to me that the salary paid her\nis out of proportion to the services rendered.\n\nI trust that the foregoing will convey to you my\nviews in regard to the situation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE,\nW. REGINA, SASK., 15th November, 1932.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 115-3-1, dated the 9th instant, with reference to the Cold Lake Indian Day School.\n\nI may say that I visited this school again on October 19th last and found conditions very unsatisfactory. There are eight Indian children enrolled, but only two were in attendance on the day of my visit. In addition to these, I found three children belonging to the Farming Instructor and four of the Teacher's own children in the classroom. This school, in my opinion, should be closed. As long as it is kept open, it will simply be used as an excuse by certain members of the Band for not sending their children to residential schools. The Indians have been informed from time to time that the existence of the school depends upon the interest they take in it. They have evidently not taken the warning seriously, in view of the fact that the attendance does not improve. It is becoming worse rather than better as time goes on. The Teacher is in receipt of a salary of $1,000.00 a year and his wife is paid $600.00 a year as Assistant Teacher and the results under existing conditions are practically nil.\n\nI may say that I have discussed the matter very candidly with the Teacher and he fully appreciate the situation and understand that the conditions which have prevailed in connection with the attendance would not justify the Department in keeping the school in operation. The Agent is of the same opinion. I would recommend that the school be closed at the end of December, as I can see no good reason for continuing it under present conditions, and that an effort should be put forth to have the children of school age on the Reserve placed in one of the Roman Catholic residential schools. The Blue Quills Residential School is situated about eighty miles from the Reserve, but it is within - three miles of -\n\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nNovember 18th, 1932.\n\nMr. Etherland -\n\nWill you kindly let me have your observations on letter hereunder from Mr. Murison with reference to the Cold Lake Indian Day school.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nOttawa, December 1, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge your 309-11B of the 15th ultimo, regarding the Cold Lake Indian Day School. It is noted that, on the occasion of your visit to this school, you found conditions unsatisfactory - there being only a small attendance of Indian children.\n\nAs the Indians take little interest in the school and the attendance has gradually become smaller, it is considered that it would be advisable to close it at the end of the academic year, viz.: June 30th, next. As the present teacher, Mr. C. Hebert, and his wife, who performs the duties of assistant teacher, have given satisfactory service, the Department does not wish to close the school at the end of the current quarter and throw them out of employment at this season of the year. However, you should inform both Mr. and Mrs. Hebert that the school is to be closed at the end of June, next, and this will give them time to secure other employment.\n\nMr. J. T. Hill, Acting Indian Agent, Onion Lake, is receiving a copy of this letter. He is being requested to see, when the school closes at the time above mentioned, that the building is properly secured and all classroom equipment stored or distributed to other schools.\n\nAny pupils of school age and in good health on the Cold Lake Reserve could be sent to residential schools. You and Mr. Hill should take the necessary action next summer to have them placed in a Residential school - either the Onion Lake or the Blue Quills Institution.\n\nIt is noted that you discussed with the teacher the closing of the Cold Lake Day School and that he understands the conditions which have prevailed in connection with the attendance, which does not justify the Department in keeping this school in operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Morrison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, December 1, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nFor your information, I am enclosing copy of a communication of today's date to Mr. Inspector Murison, regarding the closing of the Cold Lake Indian Day School. From this letter, you will observe that the school mentioned is to be closed as from June 30th, 1933, on account of the lack of interest on the part of the parents and the poor attendance.\n\nYou should see that the building is properly secured, and any classroom equipment may be distributed to other schools in your agency. Next summer, you should endeavour to have the Indian children of school age and in good health on the Cold Lake Reserve placed in residential schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

However, I do not think that the Department would be justified in incurring any further expense in connection with this school, at least not until the Indians undergo a change of heart with regard to the education of their children.\n\nW. Morrison,\nInspector.\nCOLD LAKE DAY SCHOOL\n\nI visited this school on October 19th and found only two Indian children in attendance. In addition, there were three of the Farming Instructor's children and four of the teacher's children present in the classroom. The attendance at this school, I may safely say, has never been satisfactory for any length of time. This is partly due to the indifference of the Indians regarding the education of their children and partly owing to the fact that these Indians follow hunting and trapping extensively as a means of livelihood, and, consequently this vocation necessitates their being absent from the Reserve for extended periods of time, many of them taking their whole families with them to the trap lines. The Teacher, Mr. Charles Hebert, receives a salary of $1,000.00 per year and his wife $600.00 a year as Assistant Teacher. This is a large sum of money to pay in view of the average attendance at this school. The Teacher appears bright, has a First Class Permanent Certificate for the Province of Alberta, and I am satisfied that, if he could get the attendance, he is quite capable of getting results. However, under the circumstances, no teacher however well qualified could make a satisfactory showing with such an intermittent attendance as has existed at this school.\n\nIn former reports with regard to the classroom accommodation, I mentioned that the building provided would not be suitable if...\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nDecember 7, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-3-1, of the first instant, regarding the closing of the Cold Lake Indian Day School.
