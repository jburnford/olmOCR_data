The reports received from the Principal indicate that there has been no leakage of water through the walls treated with this product.\n\nPresent indications are that we will have some funds available for further expenditure at the Alert Bay School during the current fiscal year and it would be appreciated if you would ascertain and advise me as soon as possible the amount and cost of the material that would be required to complete the waterproofing of the exterior walls in the same manner as the section which has already been treated under Mr. Warren's direction.\n\nWhen we receive this information from you it will be decided if the amount required can be provided and, in that event, it is our intention to arrange for its purchase and storage at the Alert Bay School so that it may be applied to the exterior walls when weather conditions are suitable during the spring of 1941.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nNovember 4, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo with reference to the completion of the waterproofing of the outside face of the walls of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that it is too late to do the work during the current fiscal year but as present indications are that we will have some funds available I am taking up the matter with the Surveys & Engineering Branch with a view to determining the quantity and cost of the material that would be required to complete the waterproofing of the exterior walls. When we have this information it will be decided if the funds can be provided and, in that event, the material will be purchased and shipped to the school for storage until next year when the work can be done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to your letter of September 25th, your file 156-0-5, regarding the completion of the waterproofing of the outside face of the walls of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nOn receipt of your letter I wrote to Mr. Todd for a report on the work done last year under the direction of Mr. W.C. Warren, but owing to the Agent's absence from his office considerable delay occurred in supplying the information requested.\n\nIt would appear from the reports received that the last waterproofing has proved satisfactory and that the Department would be justified in making the necessary arrangements to continue the work.\n\nIt is too late to do any of this work this fiscal year as in order to obtain satisfactory results the waterproofing material should be applied in the warm dry weather of summer.\n\nAs the work already done, including the purchase of materials, was carried out by the local Branch of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau, on instructions from the Surveys and Engineering Branch, Ottawa, I should like to suggest that the question of the purchase of the materials required be referred to that Branch who could make the necessary arrangements with their Vancouver Office to place the orders for the materials and the storage of same.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOFFICE OF THE INDIAN AGENT\n\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nOctober 26, 1940.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of October 2nd last, file 15/6/8131, I regret the delay in answering same owing to my absence from the office.\n\nEnclosed you will please find copy of a letter received from Principal Anfield, which will be self-explanatory.\n\nMy observations from time to time concur with Mr. Anfield's findings, and I would recommend that the balance of the walls be water-proofed next spring as soon as weather conditions permit, using the same material as heretofore.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"M. S. Todd\"\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOctober 25th, 1940.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to our conversation of today's date, I have made a further careful examination of the inside walls on the south-east face of the building. It can be said with reasonable certainty that the water-proofing carried out by the Department under the supervision of Mr. W. O. Warren, has proved satisfactory to date.\n\nIn conversation with those who have been constantly working on this side of the building, and from my own observations since this work was completed, it can be said that no water has seeped through from the water-proofed surfaces to the inside of the building. It is noticeable that the heavy furring which took place on these walls previously has now ceased, but continues in increasing amounts on the front wall of the school which, as you are aware, was not water-proofed.\n\nIn giving weight to the relative values of the new roof put on the school at the same time as this water-proofing was done and the water-proofing itself, it must be reported that there has been but little diminution of water in the basements coming through the front walls. This would seem to add to the value of the water-proofing work done as such seepage has stopped entirely on that face of the building.\n\nThe residence, which was water-proofed at the same time as the south east wall, has also stood up well and there are no signs of seepage through any of the walls.\n\nIn view of these facts, it would appear most likely that the completion of this water-proofing work would solve the problem of leakage into the school entirely, and it is a pleasure to hear that the Department has funds available to undertake this work. I am glad, however, that only the purchase of materials will be made at this time as it would be absolutely impossible to do such work during the weather we shall have from now on until spring.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nOffice of the Kwawkewlth Indian Agency,\n\nOctober 12th 1940\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 179, amounting to $195.55 in favour of Hoffars Limited, 1790 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, B.C., for parts for Lister gas engines at the Alert Bay Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Purchase Order 26581 A\n\nLetter No. 15-6-0-5 dated April 24, 1940.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. LA. 518\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nAlert Bay, B.C., Apr. 3, 1941.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nAlert Bay Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nVOTE: Allotment\n\nSHIP TO: Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nPurpose for which required: Repair of intake pipe line (Fire protection pump).\n\nNOTE:\u2014Requisition for non-consumable equipment, state if New Issue or Replacement.\n\nConsumable equipment and supplies use columns 1 and 2.\n\n| Quantity | Unit Price | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| 300' of \u00bd\" galvanized strand, 7 wire, 8 gauge cable, in two 150' lengths | .06 | 18.00 |\n| 6 \u00bd\" genuine Crosby clips | .49 | 2.94 |\n| 2 \u00bd\" galvanized thimbles | .10 | .20 |\n| 50 lbs pig lead | .07 | 3.50 |\n| 1 10\" cast iron melting pot | | 3.50 |\n\nFreight and cartage: 3.56\n\nTotal: $32.00\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

(RG 10, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 8)\nOttawa,\nMarch 6, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nConsideration has recently been given to the necessity for waterproofing the south and east walls of the Alert Bay School and Principal's residence. Part of the east wall was done two or three years ago but I understand that an additional coat of liquid waterproofing is advisable.\n\nIn preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1941-42 it was only found possible to include an amount of $1075.00 for repairs and improvements at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. Our funds next year will be so limited that it will be impossible to expend a larger amount than the sum mentioned.\n\nI have recently received an estimate showing that the cost of the material required for waterproofing the walls would be approximately $750.00. If the Department bought the necessary material for this work could the school management assist us by supplying labour without any cost to us? Such action on their part would be greatly appreciated as, due to present conditions, it is not possible to provide funds for the purpose.\n\nPlease discuss this matter at once with Mr. Anfield and let me have an early reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. M.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n4th March, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Alert Bay School.\n\nWith further reference to your memorandum of November 4th, 1940, relative to the proposed purchase, during the present fiscal year, of materials for the further waterproofing of the walls of the above school, I am enclosing for your information copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer, Engineering and Construction Service, dated February 27th, to which is attached a Bill of Materials.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Mills asks to be advised as soon as possible whether this work is to be undertaken during the coming summer so that he can arrange accordingly.\n\nGeneral Executive Assistant.\nFebruary 27, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Alert Bay Residential School\n\nWith reference to your memoranda of November 25th and December 12th last, regarding waterproofing for exterior walls on the above, I may say that an inspection of the school was carried out on the 1st and 2nd instant by Mr. Warren of Mr. Webb's staff.\n\nWe are now in receipt of Mr. Warren's report dated the sixth instant in which he states that moisture is entering the building through the south and east walls only, and that he was unable to find any evidence of dampness on those portions of the east wall of both the school and principal's residence which were waterproofed with Minwax in 1938. The untreated portion of the east wall and most of the south wall appear so saturated that seepage is evident in a number of basement rooms. In some spots the plaster has fallen off and in many instances in the upper floors of the school evidence of moisture penetration is present where the plaster has become soft and porous.\n\nFrom Mr. Warren's report it is noted that paint has deteriorated on the window frames, and in many cases has weathered off entirely. The absence of paint on the brickmoulds has allowed them to absorb water, which has resulted in loosening and cracking the caulking.\n\nThe need for pointing of brick joints does not appear to be great; but it is understood from the report that some work of this nature will be necessary.\n\nFrom observation and discussions with the school principal, Mr. Warren appears satisfied that no trouble from dampness has been, or is likely to be, encountered in the north and west walls.\n\nThe work involved in remedying the conditions at the school, including the principal's residence, and as reported by Mr. Warren may be summarized as follows:\n\n(a) Thoroughly clean all brick surfaces including back of parapet walls from all scale, dirt and dust. Remove efflorescence by the use of a diluted solution of hydrochloric acid.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n(b) Rake out and point all loosened and cracked mortar joints in brickwork and stone coping; and caulk all cracks and flaws in brickwork with Minwax or equal caulking compound.\n\n(c) Remove all loosened caulking from window brickmoulds, and recaulk where necessary.\n\n(d) On the south wall of both the school and principal's residence apply two coats of Minwax or equal liquid waterproofing, coloured at the job to match previous waterproofing treatment. On the areas of the east wall of both the school and principal's residence, not previously treated, apply two coats of liquid waterproofing, coloured as for south wall. On the east wall of both the school and principal's residence, previously treated, apply one additional coat of liquid waterproofing, coloured as for south wall. Waterproofing should be coloured by the addition of dry colour, and should be applied with a spray gun.\n\n(e) Due to the obliteration of the brick jointing by the coloured waterproofing, the treated surfaces will present areas of one solid colour. In order to obtain a uniform colour over the whole building, the north and west walls not being waterproofed should be coloured with two coats of oil stain, which could be prepared at the job.\n\n(f) Repaint window brickmoulds with two coats of approved paint.\n\nA spray painting machine should be provided for the application of the waterproofing material, and the oil stain. It is felt, however, that since only the purchase of materials is contemplated during the current fiscal year, arrangements might be made for the rental of such labour saving equipment, when operations are begun.\n\nI am forwarding herewith, in duplicate, a bill of materials in connection with the work, which materials are estimated to cost approximately $1,229.00, delivered at Alert Bay. This estimate may be subdivided as follows:\n\n**Waterproofing materials**\n\n- Liquid waterproofing, caulking compound and pointing materials ........................................... $750.00\n\n**Painting Materials**\n\n- Painting Materials .................................................. 200.00\n\n**Scaffolding Materials and accessories**\n\n- Scaffolding Materials and accessories ......................... 179.00\n\n**Expendable Sundries**\n\n- Brushes, paint pails, trowels, chisels cleaning materials, etc. ........................................... 100.00\n\n**Estimated Total**\n\n- Estimated Total .................................................... $1229.00\n\nIf a spray painting unit is not available for rental when required, add ........................................... $250.00\nOwing to Minwax having been used already on parts of the buildings at Alert Bay and the satisfactory results obtained to date, it is recommended that Minwax should be utilized for the proposed work.\n\nThe waterproofing work should be started not later than June 1st, and should be completed by the end of July, while painting could be carried on until September 15th.\n\nWith regard to labour it is probable that all labour, including a foreman for the work, may have to be obtained in Vancouver, due to the absence of local labour during the fishing season.\n\nIn this connection I may say that labour and other costs on the work, which it is understood will be carried out during the 1941-42 fiscal year, are estimated to be approximately as follows:\n\nLabour for waterproofing ............. $1,550.00\nLabour for painting .................... 650.00\nContingencies, engineering, etc. ..... 300.00\n\nEstimated total 1941-42 .............. $2,500.00\n\nYou will observe that the materials to be provided from funds available during the current fiscal year, together with expenditures for carrying out the work next fiscal year, are estimated to cost approximately $2,980.00.\n\nIt would be appreciated if we were advised as soon as possible whether the above work will be undertaken this summer so we can arrange accordingly.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nChief Engineer.\nBILL OF MATERIALS FOR\nWATERPROOFING AND PAINTING\nAT ALERT BAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nWaterproofing Materials\n\nHeavy Clear Minwax Waterproofing\n1 only 55 U.S. gallon drum\n2 \" 30 \" \" drums\n2 \" 5 \" \" \"\n\nMinwax No. 1 Caulking Compound\n11 only 65 lb. irons\nColour - grey\nConsistency - for caulking gun use\n\nPainting Materials\n50 Imperial gallons raw linseed oil\n50 \" \" boiled linseed oil\n500 lbs.

J. Arnall\nS.P.W. Engineer, D.P.W.\nMr. F. EARL ANFIELD  \nPrincipal\n\nThe Indian Agent,  \nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Todd,\n\nFurther to our conversation of today's date in consideration of Mr Hoey's letter to you, file 156-0-5, of March 6th, last; and of the Commissioners letter to you, file 15-6-524 of Feb. 22nd last, with enclosed report and recommendation of Mr W.G. Warren of the Survey and Engineering Branch and your reply thereto under date of March 5th, I have given this matter very careful thought and have made a thorough study of the report submitted by Mr Warren.\n\nTo accept Mr Hoey's suggestion would involve a tacit responsibility for any work done and this I am unable to do. The problem of waterproofing this building is an extremely difficult one and I have not enough technical knowledge to see that the recommendations made by Mr Warren are properly carried out. If however, the point of responsibility is not raised at all and the matter approached from a strictly financial angle I would estimate the cost of labour as far beyond the absorbable possibilities of the School per capita grants and I could not conscientiously recommend such an expenditure to the I.R.S. Commission, M.S.C., as much as they and the writer would like to be of assistance to the Department. Most expenditures at this school are in the nature of fixed charges. The children have to be fed, clothed, kept warm and healthy. With increased costs and diminishing returns due to the cut, an almost irreducible minimum of maintenance cost has been reached. The only fluid budget head is that of salaries and the per capita cuts forced a reduction in these to a point where staff members are receiving $27.50 per month with maintenance, and doing up to fourteen or more hours a day.\n\nMr Warren's labour cost on the proposed work totalled $1500.00 approx: for the brick work only. To do the painting required, a further item for labour totalling $630.00 approx: was noted; a sum total of $2130.00 to be expended on labour. Mr Warren's report showed a total material cost of $1398.00 approx: which Mr Hoey's letter has reduced to $750.00 of available funds. Reduced proportionately the $2130.00 labour cost would amount to $1225.00 to be put up by the school authority, presumably from per capita grants. Should our I.R.S. Commission have such a surplus available, I would feel compelled to make a very strong appeal that it be utilized to increase the reduced salaries of the staff and to restore or implement courses that the cuts in per capita grants have necessitated.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I cannot support Mr Hoey's suggestion.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPrincipal.\nMr. F. EARL ANFIELD  \nPrincipal\n\nThe Indian Agent,  \nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Todd:\n\nFurther to correspondence from Mr Hoey, in which it was suggested that the School authority might assist in the cost of waterproofing the School; and stating that the sum of $1075.00 only would be available for all the Departmental needs of the School; it would seem imperative that the Department should be informed without delay that the following items will have to be taken care of this summer without fail, if valuable property is to be maintained in efficient order.\n\n(1) Main boilers will require new smoke boxes, hoods and all new metal stacking. Present equipment is paper thin and can be punched through anywhere. Furnace gases are leaking badly into boiler room. Estimated cost $200.00, though exact cost is now being secured from the makers of the boilers.\n\n(2) Pomona deep well pump has been in operation II years without a cent of expense to the Department. Increasing loss of water and wobbling in head are proof that this pump must be pulled this summer, without fail, and new impellers, bearing and bronze seats installed. Estimate to hand for parts $148.00 f.o.b. Vancouver. The School would do the work.\n\n(3) Lighting plant engines must have new cylinder heads and perhaps new pistons. These engines have operated II years without a stop of any kind. Estimated needs for parts $350.00 at least.\n\nThere are other urgent needs, but the three jobs mentioned herewith are imperative if the plant is to continue operating. We must have heat, water and light if the school is to function at all. I mention this with the very definite hope that the funds available will be apportioned to take care of the above.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nApril 7, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant the Department authorizes an expenditure of $132.00 in order to repair the intake pipe of the fire protection pump at the Alert Bay Residential School. It is noted that of this amount $100.00 will be required for labour and $32.00 for the material shown on the attached list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith application of Mr. Indian Agent Todd, dated March 29, 1941, to expend $100.00 for labour and, in addition, purchase material for repair of the intake pipe of the fire protection pump at Alert Bay Indian Residential School, the cost of material being estimated by the Dominion Water and Power Bureau to cost $32.00 as per attached requisition, a total of $132.00, assuming that labour costs will amount to that estimated, which I presume is a maximum estimate.\n\nThese repairs have become necessary owing to the fact that some seagoing craft or log boom has become entangled with that part of the pipe line on or below the foreshore, dragging the pipe out of line and thereby breaking the leaded joints, consequently it will be necessary to realign the pipe and recaulk the joints, which Mr. Todd considers can be done by local labour without the necessity of supervision by the engineers of the Water and Power Bureau, the latter concurring with this proposal.\n\nAs the school is meanwhile without fire protection from this pump, I would recommend approval of the application, and request that if at all possible authority be granted to proceed with the work as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nMarch 29, 1941.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 25th last, No.15-6-1128, in which you enclosed correspondence in connection with damage done to the intake pipe at the Alert Bay Residential School.\n\nToday I went into this matter with Principal Anfield, and while we both feel repairs are difficult to do owing to tides, nevertheless we are prepared to undertake the same, and I enclose you herewith copy of Mr. Anfield's letter which will be self-explanatory.\n\nAs this matter is of some urgency, I would appreciate if you would kindly communicate with the Department by Air Mail requesting authority for approximately $100.00 for labour to do these repairs and at the same time arrange with the W.P. Branch to ship us by return the materials requested in paragraphs (b) and (c) of Mr. Anfield's letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Ms. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\nINDIAN & ESKIMO RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL COMMISSION\n\nMr. F. EARL ANFIELD\nPrincipal\n\nST. MICHAEL'S SCHOOL\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nMarch 29th, 1941\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd,\n\nFurther to our conversation of today's date re the work needed to put the fire pump intake back into proper condition, I would confirm the following requirements:\n\na/ Labour.\u2014 approx. $100.00. This would be contingent entirely on tidal conditions permitting the work of leading points to be completed.\n\nb/ A joint leading outfit with sufficient lead to take care of two or three joints should others be strained. This could be obtained, I presume, through the Water Power Branch in Vancouver.\n\nc/ New holding cables to replace those broken. The specifications and cost of these should be on file in the W.P. Branch in Vancouver and this new cable could likely be purchased from their office and shipped direct. Cable clamps should be included.\n\nIt should be borne in mind very distinctly that skilled local labour is a very limited matter and if in pulling these pipes into place, weakened joints should break, the whole intake will have to be floated out. Such a job should be in charge of an engineer in my opinion.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nApril 2nd, 1941.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to Departmental letter of March 6th last, No.186-95, in which you request information in connection with repairs and improvements to the Alert Bay Residential School, I beg to advise I have gone into this matter very carefully with Principal Anfield, and I enclose herewith copy of his reply which will be self-explanatory.\n\nI also enclose a further letter from Principal Anfield in which he points out some items which are necessary to be attended to this year which amount to approximately Seven Hundred Dollars.\n\nIt would therefore appear impossible for the Department to undertake the necessary work as well as purchase the waterproofing material for the school even if it were possible for the School to provide funds to take care of the labour. Under the circumstances, it is difficult for me to recommend to the Department what action should be taken in respect to the waterproofing of the school.\n\nI agree with Principal Anfield that the work to be done on the school should be done by an expert, as this has always been considered such by our engineers. In my opinion we should not spend any further money for experimenting on the walls of this school, but rather realise we have got to face a situation that exists and definitely provide sufficient funds to have the work done which would be of a permanent nature.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nMr. F. EARL ANFIELD  \nPrincipal\n\nThe Indian Agent,  \nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Todd,\n\nFurther to our conversation of today's date in consideration of Mr Hoey's letter to you, file 156-0-5, of March 6th, last; and of the Commissioners letter to you, file 15-6-524 of Feb. 22nd last, with enclosed report and recommendation of Mr W.O. Warren of the Survey and Engineering Branch and your reply thereto under date of March 5th, I have given this matter very careful thought and have made a thorough study of the report submitted by Mr Warren.\n\nTo accept Mr Hoey's suggestion would involve a tacit responsibility for any work done and this I am unable to do. The problem of waterproofing this building is an extremely difficult one and I have not enough technical knowledge to see that the recommendations made by Mr Warren are properly carried out. If however, the point of responsibility is not raised at all and the matter approached from a strictly financial angle I would estimate the cost of labour as far beyond the absorbable possibilities of the School per capita grants and I could not conscientiously recommend such an expenditure to the I.R.S. Commission, M.S.O.C., much as they and the writer would like to be of assistance to the Department. Most expenditures at this school are in the nature of fixed charges. The children have to be fed, clothed, kept warm and healthy. With increased costs and diminishing returns due to the 5% cut, an almost irreducible minimum of maintenance cost has been reached. The only fluid budget head is that of salaries, and the per capita cuts forced a reduction in these to a point where staff members are receiving $27.80 per month with maintenance, and doing up to fourteen or more hours a day.\n\nMr Warren's labour cost on the proposed work totalled $1500.00 approx; for the brick work only. To do the painting required, a further item for labour totalling $630.00 approx; was noted; a sum total of $2130.00 to be expended on labour. Mr Warren's report showed a total material cost of $1304.00 approx; which Mr Hoey's letter has reduced to $750.00 of available funds. Reduced proportionately the $2130.00 labour cost would amount to $1225.00 to be put up by the school authority, presumably from per capita grants. Should our I.R.S. Commission have such a surplus available, I would feel compelled to make a very strong appeal that it be utilized to increase the reduced salaries of the staff and to restore or implement courses that the cuts in per capita grants have necessitated.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I cannot support Mr Hoey's suggestion.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPrincipal.\nMr. F. EARL ANFIELD  \nPrincipal  \n\nThe Indian Agent,  \nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Todd:\n\nFurther to correspondence from Mr Hoey, in which it was suggested that the School authority might assist in the cost of waterproofing the School; and stating that the sum of $1075.00 only would be available for all the Departmental needs of the School; it would seem imperative that the Department should be informed without delay that the following items will have to be taken care of this summer without fail, if valuable property is to be maintained in efficient order.\n\n(1) Main boilers will require new smoke boxes, hoods and all new metal stacking. Present equipment is paper thin and can be punched through anywhere. Furnace gases are leaking badly into boiler room. Estimated cost $200.00, though exact cost is now being secured from the makers of the boilers.\n\n(2) Pomona deep well pump has been in operation II years without a cent of expense to the Department. Increasing loss of water and wobbling in head are proof that this pump must be pulled this summer, without fail, and new impellers, bearing and bronze seats installed. Estimate to hand for parts $148.00 f.o.b. Vancouver. The School would do the work.\n\n(3) Lighting plant engines must have new cylinder heads and perhaps new pistons. These engines have operated II years without a stop of any kind. Estimated needs for parts $350.00 at least.\n\nThere are other urgent needs, but the three jobs mentioned herewith are imperative if the plant is to continue operating. We must have heat, water and light if the school is to function at all. I mention this with the very definite hope that the funds available will be apportioned to take care of the above.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nReplying to Departmental letter of March 6th last, No.156-9-5, in which you request information in connection with repairs and improvements to the Alert Bay Residential School, I beg to advise I have gone into this matter very carefully with Principal Anfield, and I enclose herewith copy of his reply which will be self-explanatory.\n\nI also enclose a further letter from Principal Anfield in which he points out some items which are necessary to be attended to this year which amount to approximately Seven Hundred Dollars.\n\nIt would therefore appear impossible for the Department to undertake the necessary work as well as purchase the waterproofing material for the school even if it were possible for the School to provide funds to take care of the labour.

If such is the case, one can readily understand that the repairs suggested by Indian Agent Todd are urgently needed. I am returning the quotation received by the Indian Agent from Pumps & Power, Limited, and departmental approval is granted for you to make the purchases as outlined. No reference is made in this correspondence to the amount necessary for labour. It is just possible, of course, that the labour costs may be borne by the school authorities.\n\nYours truly,\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMajor D. M.

This firm, as stated by Mr. Anfield, has the only Agency for this pump in British Columbia, so I would recommend that the order be placed with them.\n\nA Requisition in triplicate is also enclosed for the necessary parts, and as this equipment should be overhauled and repaired in the near future, I would recommend that the order be approved by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

The above will be deducted from the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Alert Bay School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith a requisition for two sets of smoke boxes and hoods complete, together with the necessary pipes and connections for the main and H.P. boilers at the Alert Bay Residential School. Copies of an exchange of correspondence relative to this matter are enclosed, together with quotations and equipment required from the makers of the boilers. It will be observed that the price quoted by this firm for the necessary equipment is $365.00.\n\nThe supply of this equipment is necessary and I would recommend that same be provided as soon as possible as the matter would appear to be urgent. A reply by air mail would be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\n17th May, 1941.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of May 12th last, No. 15-6-1958, which is in reply to mine of May 6th last, enclosing requisition for two sets of smoke boxes and hoods complete, together with pipes and connections for the main and H.P. boilers at the Alert Bay Residential School, I can only reiterate my report that the smoke boxes, hoods and stove pipes have collapsed and it is necessary to make complete replacement, and that the matter is very urgent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\nMay 12, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to refer to your letter of May 6th enclosing requisition for two sets of smoke boxes and hoods complete, together with all pipes and connections for main and H.P. boilers at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, and copies of correspondence relating thereto.\n\nNo provision whatever was made in the Estimates of recent years for this expenditure. In 1938-39 an item of $72 for new hoods and stove pipes for the main boilers was included in a list of requirements forwarded by Mr. Anfield. The Estimates for your Agency, however, were late in arriving here on that occasion. Consequently, the requirements of your Agency had to be made up in this office based on the former year's submission and no provision could be made for the item of $72 referred to.\n\nIn Mr. Arnall's report of November 12, 1940, reference is made to the smoke pipe and breaching being thin, but no recommendation for replacement was made.\n\nThere is no doubt that the appropriation for such services has been severely cut and if replacement of these hoods is not an urgent necessity it might be well to provide for same in your forthcoming estimates. Otherwise, the expenditure, if approved, will undoubtedly be made from the reduced amount set aside for St. Michael's for this fiscal year.\n\nPlease consult Mr. Anfield and let me have your reply at the earliest possible date, when, if necessary, the matter will be referred to the Department for consideration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nM.S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nMay 6th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAttached please find correspondence with enclosure from Principal Anfield of St. Michael's School, which will be self-explanatory.\n\nUpon receipt of this letter, I interviewed Mr. Anfield and he informs me he reported in 1937 in his Estimates that it would be necessary to buy new hoods and stove pipe for the main boilers, but no further action was taken, and the parts have since gradually deteriorated until now the smoke boxes as well have collapsed and it is necessary to make a complete replacement of the parts requested.\n\nMr. Anfield states he reported the above to Mr. T.G. Arnall when he was making his last boiler inspection, but apparently through an oversight Mr. Arnall has omitted to include it in his report.\n\nAs this matter is very urgent, will the Department please give it their immediate attention?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Mr Todd:\n\nAttached please find bids from the Vancouver Iron Works for the manufacture and shipment f.o.b. Alert Bay at a cost of $365.00 of new smoke boxes, hoods and stacking for the main and H.P. boilers of this school. To get a bid on this work, it was necessary to dismantle one of the boilers and ship the smoke box and hood to the Vancouver Iron Works, the makers of these boilers in 1929.\n\nIf competitive bids are required, it will be necessary to have this equipment sent from the Vancouver Iron Works plant to other tenderers.\n\nThe School is without the use of one boiler and as the hood and smoke box on the one still in operation are in as bad or worse condition than the one shipped down, it is earnestly requested that replacement of this equipment be expedited. This is the first expense on these boilers in eleven years of steady operation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nVANCOUVER IRON WORKS LTD.\n\n\"The Iron Works\"\nDesigners & Builders of Boilers Tanks & Steel Plate Work\nElectrically Welded Steel Pipe\n\n1195 Sixth Avenue West\nVancouver, B.C.\n\n29th April, 1941.\n\nAll quotations are subject to change without notice and to confirmation by us on acceptance.\nAll quotations covering imported goods are based upon Canadian Customs Duty, Excise Tax, Sales Tax, Exchange and Freight Rates existing at date of quotation.

Fifteen minutes is enough to prepare it to bake. My experience is that it is the easiest Oven to work with, as I can raise up the heat or let it down as easy as I please. Bread and fancy pastries are done beautifully.\n\n(Sgd) A. De Moor, Royal Bakery, St. Boniface, Man.\n\nI have been using your ECONOMY OVEN for over eight years now, baking bread and pastries, and am very much satisfied with it.\n\n(Sgd) P. Meyer, Notre Dame de Lourdes, Man.\n\nI have been using your ECONOMY OVEN No. 2 now for six and a half years and in all that time I have never had one bad batch of bread, cakes or pies; and I have turned out three batches of bread in one day from 48 to 50 loaves in each batch. Every day, except Sundays, I have been using the Oven with every success and satisfaction.\n\n(Sgd) M. A. Lunn, Lunn's Home Bakery, McGregor, Man.\n\nFor two years I baked at the Lebret Indian School, where I used your ECONOMY OVEN with every satisfaction - so pleased am I with it that I am buying one for my own bake shop in town. I believe it will pay for itself in 12 months with the saving of fuel. My previous oven was one of the old type, solid brick 12' x 14' in size and burning nearly a cord of wood to bake a batch of 280 loaves.\n\n(Sgd) J. Z. Lafleur, baker, Lebret, Sask.\n\nIn 1922 I bought a No. 4 ECONOMY OVEN from you, which gave me entire satisfaction as long as I used it. In 1926 I lost my bake shop, but the Oven being so portable, I was able to salvage it. I was unfortunate in a second fire in 1928, as it gained so much headway before being noticed that I was unable to save anything. The same day I placed an order for another No. 4 and that is the Oven I still have, and with which I would not care to part.\n\nWhen estimating the cost of baking two years ago, I found that with half a cord of wood, costing $2.50, plus .30 for sawing same, making a total cost of $2.80, I baked 4,611 loaves of 16 oz. bread. Believe me, I am satisfied with the low fuel cost of this oven. I bake an average of 180 loaves 16 oz. and there is a lot of room left. I am sure that it is possible to bake two sacks of flour into four pound loaves in this Oven.\n\nAnother great advantage of the Oven is its cleanliness. It does not dirty the shop in any way. I think a lot of the ECONOMY OVEN - in fact I know of no oven to touch it, and I will always be at your service in demonstrating it or showing it to those interested.\n\n(Sgd) Florent Girard, baker, St. Ann des Chenes, Man.\n\nC2/3-33/1000.\nPUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.\n\nWe have been using our ECONOMY OVEN for the past 12 years and we appreciate highly its advantages and today we thank you for having supplied us with an excellent yet inexpensive baking system. It is a real saving to us and we cannot praise it too highly. It is very low in operating cost and its large capacity gives the advantage of large quantity bake at one time and very evenly. The baking is done with little drudgery for the baker. Accept our expression of gratitude.\n\n(Sgd) Les Filles de la Croix, Lafleche, Sask.\n\nWe received the ECONOMY OVEN a week ago. The Sisters tell me it is a marvel.\n\n(Sgd) Rev. Father L. Pilon, O.M.I., Principal,\nLac la Biche Mission, Alberta.\n\nIt is with pleasure that I recommend the ECONOMY OVEN we got from you last year. We have been using it constantly ever since with complete satisfaction. Accept our good wishes.\n\n(Sgd) Sister St. Laure, Superior,\nSt. Joseph's Hospital, Sudbury, Ontario.\n\nWe have been using your large ECONOMY OVEN since 1918 for the cooking of bread and pastry and the results obtained in all respects are most satisfactory. The baking is quick and perfect and the saving in fuel and work soon paid for the Oven. I can strongly recommend the ECONOMY OVEN.\n\n(Sgd) Sister M. A. Prono, Treasurer,\nSt. Boniface Hospital, St. Boniface, Manitoba.\n\nThe ECONOMY OVEN, No. 3, was installed in the School by the Department of Indian Affairs in 1922, or over ten years ago. We have used it regularly and have found it satisfactory in every respect.\n\n(Sgd) Rev. A. R. Lett, Principal, St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B. C.\n\nOur ECONOMY OVEN gives us complete satisfaction.\n\n(Sgd) Sister Eusebie, Superior, Convent of the Sisters of Charity, Havre St. Pierre, Quebec.\n\nOur ECONOMY OVEN, No. 3, has been in use for three years and has given splendid service. I can recommend this Oven for perfect baking.\n\n(Sgd) Rev. Joseph Jores, Principal, Indian Residential School, Ahousaht, British Columbia.\n\nC3/3-33/1000.\nPUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.\n\nWe have had your ECONOMY OVENS in our Institution for some time. The first was installed in 1920 and the second one in 1922. They have both proven entirely satisfactory.\n\n(Sgd) W. A. Hendry, Principal, Indian Residential School, Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nWe are actually using four of your ECONOMY OVENS, Noiel No. 3, in our boarding schools and I take much pleasure in stating that we are entirely satisfied with them. I will shortly place an order for one for our Hospitals.\n\n(Sgd) Rev. Father J. C. Lefebvre, O.M.I., Vicarate Bursar, North-west Territories, Fort McMurray, N.W.T., Canada.\n\nOur ECONOMY OVEN No. 4, is giving, and since we bought it five years ago, has always given perfect satisfaction. It is easily operated and the bread is always well baked.\n\n(Sgd) Rev. Geo. Forbes, O.M.I., Principal, Cariboo Indian School, 145 Mile Sta., British Columbia.\n\nOur ECONOMY OVEN No. 3, purchased six years ago is giving every satisfaction.\n\n(Sgd) Sr. St. Ferdinand, Sisters of the Assumption, Ermineskin Indian School, Hobema, Alberta.\n\nWe are most satisfied with our ECONOMY OVEN, which is very economical in fuel and very easy to control - turning out delicious baking. We are entirely satisfied with it.\n\n(Sgd) Sister J. C., Maison St. Joseph, Otterburne, Manitoba.\n\nAm well pleased with the OVEN, and find it \"Economy\" indeed.\n\n(Sgd) Rev. F. E. Pitts, Principal, Indian Residential School, Alberni, British Columbia.\n\nIt is many years now that we have used two of your No. 4 ECONOMY OVENS and they have given us at all times, most complete satisfaction. In other words, economy of fuel, perfect and uniform baking of bread is our experience with them.\n\n(Sgd) Father G. Leonard, O.M.I., Principal, Indian Residential School, Lebret, Sask.\n\nC4/3-33/1000.\nThe two ECONOMY OVENS you supplied us for our Camps on the Slave Falls Hydro Development, proved highly satisfactory and were in every respect as you described them, both as to economy and service. We believe the ECONOMY OVEN is one of the best and would not hesitate to recommend it to any prospective buyer.\n\n(Sgd) Chas. V. Blake, John Gunn & Sons, Ltd.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nI have been using an ECONOMY OVEN for the past three months, and it has given the utmost satisfaction. It will heat up in 20 minutes and costs one cent per hour for operation.\n\n(Sgd) Z. J. Bourdon, Manager, Midget Pie Shop,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nWe use our ECONOMY OVEN for cakes, biscuits and pastry and it has proven very satisfactory in every detail.\n\n(Sgd) E. Birdsall, Pinehurst Inn, Victoria Beach, Manitoba.\n\nThe ECONOMY OVEN you sent us is a little marvel. The very first day we tried it we had lovely bread to sell over the counter and the expense for the wood used in baking the bread was so small that we could not compare it with what we had to use in our old oven. We believe that the saving in fuel will be sufficient to enable us to pay for our Oven inside a year. You should advertise it as much as you can, as it deserves to be known.\n\n(Sgd) A. B. Cote, Manager, Red & White Stores,\nMcLennan, (Peace River Country) Alberta.\n\nThe ECONOMY OVEN is proving very satisfactory and economical. I use it for baking bread for foxes. I think no Oven could be more satisfactory or easy to manage.\n\n(Sgd) J. W. Jones, Fox Breeder, Charlottetown,\nPrince Edward Island.\n\nI have used your ECONOMY OVEN for 10 years in my home and with the most complete satisfaction. I have baked biscuits, cakes, pies and bread in it, all at once, and they come out perfectly done. All the wood necessary for one baking is a mere handful. Its name is appropriate. The Oven is a pleasure to work with.\n\n(Sgd) Mrs. M. Sweeney, 374 Horace St., Norwood, Manitoba.\n\nWe find our No. 2 ECONOMY OVEN ideal for a fur farm. It is very suitable and our experience has been that of satisfaction.\n\n(Sgd) Sven Klintberg, Mgr., Winnipeg Silver Fox Company,\nBird's Hill, Manitoba.\nKIRKLAND & ROSE\nBAKERS & CONFECTIONERS SUPPLIES\nTOOLS, UTENSILS, MACHINERY & EQUIPMENT\nSOUP FOUNTAINS & FOUNTAIN SUNDRIES\n\n130 WATER STREET\nVANCOUVER, CANADA\n\nJuly 11th, 1941\n\nF.E.

When forwarding accounts, you should attach a copy of your purchase order.\n\nIn connection with your second letter of the 18th instant, it is noted that the cost of the beds and mattresses requested by the Principal will exceed $500. You should, therefore, let me have definite information regarding the length and width of the beds and mattresses required. The only information supplied by the agent in the estimates this year was a request for 25 No. 4000 beds and 25 mattresses.

This price may of course have advanced since that time.\n\nWould you kindly take the matter up with the Department and ascertain from them whether it will be possible to purchase these beds, or a portion of them this year, and if so I will obtain tenders and submit requisitions in the usual way.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

Todd,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nWe are desperately in need of at least twenty-five beds, mattresses and pillows this year, but before calling for bids on them, I would greatly appreciate your finding out if there is any likelihood at all of the Department having funds to purchase them.\n\nAs you know we have asked for them for three years but we have now reached the place where we will not have enough beds to sleep our reduced pupilage.\n\nWhen the school was built in 1929 we moved in nearly seventy beds from the old schools and as these had already done nearly twenty years service and are now completely finished.\n\nThe bids secured last year totalled $536.00.\n\nThanking you,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\"F.

Since that time, no doubt, prices have advanced slightly, but this would give the Department the approximate cost, and I would appreciate if you would kindly advise me if money was provided for this work in order that we can have it done.\n\nI might add the barn needs painting very badly to keep it from deteriorating, and I would recommend that it be painted if funds are available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nAm attaching bids secured last year for painting the School barn.\n\nIt will be appreciated if you would find out if there is any possible chance of having this work done this summer before having these bids revised. It is useless asking firms to keep on bidding year by year if the Department has not the funds to undertake the work.\n\nThe barn was built and painted one coat only in 1930 and not a thing has been done to it since. The building urgently needs painting as the rains go right through the drop siding and the lumber is in real danger of rot. I would not think of asking for this work in these times except for the fact that lack of such paint will bring on the ruin of a $6000.00 barn. I would offer to have the labour supplied by the School but for the heights involved. It would not seem right to have Indian children painting a barn of this size.\n\nThanking you for your advice, and awaiting your reply.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nFEA/B.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nLetter No.\n\nOffice of the Kwawkewlth Indian Agency,\n\nJune 18, 1941\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 73, amounting to $395.19 in favour of Vancouver Iron Works, Ltd., 1155 West 6th Avenue, Vancouver, B.C. for construction of 2 new smoke boxes and hoods complete for the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.

Your kind cooperation will greatly oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Ms. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nFurther to our conversation re the hot-water heating boiler at this School, attached please find copies of letters received from Patterson Boiler Works, makers of this boiler. It is noted that they recommend the boiler should be sent down for retubing and that the cost would be from $35.00 to $40.00. To this would be added freight charges both ways and cartage in Vancouver.\n\nThis boiler has never given satisfaction at this School and were it not for the coils in the main heating boilers, we would be hard pressed to get adequate hot water for our requirements.\n\nHowever, in view of the urgent need of a hot water heater, I would recommend that this equipment be sent down for prompt retubing, testing and return.\n\nYour assistance and recommendation will be greatly appreciated.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nFEA:B\nEnc.\nVancouver, B. C.\nApril 20th, 1942.\n\nMr. F. Earl Anfield,\nPrincipal, Missionary Society of Church of England,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to yours of the 17th inst. The cost of a new set of tubes for your hot water heater would be about $10.00.\n\nHowever we believe it would be advisable for you to send the boiler here and have it retubed, as in all probability it will require retubing throughout. The cost of retubing same complete and testing would be about $35.00 to $40.00.\n\nWe hardly think your local machinist could make a satisfactory job, as tubes have to be expanded in and not welded.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPatterson Boiler Works Ltd.\n\nPer C.D.P.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Todd requesting that certain repairs be made to the hot water heater at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, together with copies of letters from Mr. Anfield and the Patterson Boiler Works Ltd., relating to the matter. This boiler was supplied by the Department to the school in 1938 at a cost of $328.00 - refer your P.O. 8392 and E.R. 1770.\n\nAlthough Mr. Anfield states in his letter of April 22nd, addressed to Mr. Todd that \"this boiler has never given satisfaction at the school\", no previous complaint regarding the boiler was made to this office. The Patterson Boiler Works supplied the unit and it is just possible that the Principal may have had some correspondence with this Company on the subject.\n\nAs immediate repairs are necessary I would recommend that the Department approve of having the boiler sent to the Patterson Boiler Works and that the cost involved be paid either from school funds or charged to the allotment to this school for maintenance of equipment for the current fiscal year.\n\nA reply by air mail would be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nApril 22nd, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe enclosed copy of letter received from Principal Anfield, will be self-explanatory.\n\nFor your information, this boiler was purchased by the Department three years ago, and in my opinion should have given longer service than it has; however as it is an emergency repair job, I would recommend that authority be granted at once for the boiler to be shipped to Vancouver and the necessary repairs made as the school are finding it difficult to carry on without a sufficient hot water supply.\n\nWould you kindly advise me by return mail whether Principal Anfield may ship the boiler to Vancouver for the repairs required, the accounts to be forwarded to this office for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"M.S.Todd\"\n\n(M.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa,\nJune 17, 1942.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $450.00 was provided for repairs and painting at the Alert Bay School and an amount of $1300.00 for a new water tank, beds and mattresses. We have already authorized expenditures of approximately $120.00. The balance, of course, is still available. You should confer with the Principal immediately and submit detailed information regarding the manner in which the amount available should be expended. In the event of any materials or supplies being required explicit information should be given, as this is required by our Purchasing Branch. Your recommendations should be forwarded through the office of Indian Commissioner MacKay.\n\nDue to present conditions it is most important that we hear from you at the earliest possible date. As you are aware, it is extremely difficult to obtain deliveries on many items and, therefore, the sooner the order is placed the better for all parties concerned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I have before me a copy of the list of requirements which Mr. Principal Anfield forwarded to Mr. Indian Agent Todd on July 1st last, and assume that the Indian Agent will have forwarded that list to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBRW:A.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nLetter No.\n\nOffice of the Kwawkewlth Indian Agency,\n\nJune 18, 1942\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 54, amounting to $54.68 in favour of Patterson Boiler Works Ltd., 750 Alexander Street, Vancouver, B.C., for repairs to hot water boiler at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, including shipping charges to and from Alert Bay to Vancouver.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental letter 156-6-5 of April 27, 1942.\n\nLetter No. 215-6-7913 dated April 29, 1942, from Indian Commissioner D.M.

T.B.R. Westgate, Secretary of the M.S.C.C., stating that the Principal of the Alert Bay School forwarded to you, on July 1 last, a list of the requirements at the school. This list has not yet reached the Department and it would be appreciated if you would forward it immediately. In this regard I would refer you to official letter of June 17 last.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. M.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of August 11th last, file 156-0-5, I beg to advise you Rev. T.B.R. Westgate, Secretary of the M.S.C.C., is apparently confused in the correspondence received from Principal Anfield of St. Michael's School.\n\nApparently Dr. Westgate is referring to Principal Anfield's letter of July 1st last dealing with his Estimates for 1943-44, which were included with ours and which are now at the Indian Commissioner's office for his attention. This letter of Mr. Anfield's gives a list of requirements for the school for that period, but which are not required at the present time.\n\nIn Departmental letter No.156-0-5 of June 17th last, you pointed out there were certain funds available for the school for the current year, and advising out of the $1,750 approved, an expenditure of approximately $120.00 had been made. In this connection, our records only show that one voucher, amounting to $84.68, has been spent, and I would appreciate if you would kindly advise me what the $120.00 represents.\n\nIn the appropriations approved for the current year, it is the desire of Principal Anfield and myself to keep these to a minimum. We have gone over the various items requested, and have decided it is necessary to ask for the one item of $894.00 for a hot water tank, but this cannot be done until such time as the Boiler Inspector arrives and makes his recommendations, giving the necessary information to meet the requirements. Just when Mr. Arnall will be able to let us have this we are not sure, as he has informed us he cannot make his annual inspection for a short time yet. I might add the cost of equipment has increased, and no doubt the amount of $894.00 asked for will have in all probability, to be increased to $1,000.00.\n\nIn addition to this there will be only one other small item of expenditure requested, particulars regarding which will be forwarded shortly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa,\nAugust 28, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. A review of our files indicates that of the $1750.00 provided $34.68 has already been spent for repairs to the hot water boiler. Consequently, there is a balance of $1695.32 still available.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. M.S.

If funds can be provided for this purpose, I would recommend approval of the application.\n\nAlso enclosed are quotations from the Restmore Manufacturing Co.

The alternative would be the installation of a large wood-burning furnace which is out of the question at the present time.\n\nI would recommend that this expenditure be approved and would appreciate the Department's decision by airmail.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

They promptly air mailed the letter to this office and on Thursday morning, upon receipt, we wired directly to Alert Bay suggesting that they immediately make application through their supplier, Union Oil Company, for a temporary permit.

I note from this report that he suggests the tank be secured next year. However, it might be inferred from your letter that you feel it should be replaced immediately. It would be appreciated if you would discuss this matter again with Mr. Arnall and, if he feels the tank should be replaced now, please have him prepare and forward complete specifications regarding the size and type of tank needed. It will likely be very difficult to secure this tank, due to present conditions, at least that is our experience in one or two similar cases.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I should appreciate hearing from you with regard to the last paragraph of that memorandum.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey\n\nCrane Limited, Victoria, B.C., have written us advising that they can supply the steel storage tank and accessories for the Alert Bay C.E. Indian Residential School, with the exception of the 5th item of purchase order 16314 calling for:\n\n1 only 2\u00bd\" - #64S Crane tank temperature regulating valve with bulb and 8' flexible cable. $130.00\n\nTo procure this item, they state that the U.S. manufacturers require a priority rating of AA-2. Our experience has been that it is virtually impossible to obtain such a high rating on an article of this kind, unless its end use is definitely connected with the war effort.\n\nI would suggest that you arrange to obtain the advice of Commissioner MacKay regarding this matter. He may be able to procure a Canadian made substitute or a suitable second-hand regulating valve. If not, could the installation be made without this regulator, to the satisfaction of the Provincial Boiler Inspectors.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 28, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 26th instant, the Department approves an expenditure of approximately $75.00 in the purchase of material required at the Alert Bay Residential School to comply with the new dim-cut regulations. A copy of your purchase order should be attached to the account.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI beg to forward herewith copy of a letter received from Mr. Anfield, Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, making application for authority to purchase materials required for eighty-four (84) windows of the school in order to comply with the new Dim-out Regulations.\n\nThree (3) ply veneer is not available as the entire output is being used in connection with the war effort. The only suitable substitute available locally is Murray Wall Board which Mr. Anfield has advised will meet requirements. Seventeen hundred (1700) square feet of this material will be required, the cost of which f. o. b. Vancouver, is estimated at approximately $75.00.\n\nIt will be observed that Mr. Anfield is not in a position to purchase this material from school funds and requests that same be provided by the Department. Under the circumstances I would recommend that the Department approve of the expenditure involved. As the matter is urgent a reply by airmail would be helpful.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nCOPY.\n\nSt. Michael's Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. F. Earl Anfield, S.M.\nPrincipal.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nP.O. Box 70\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nOn today's mail I received notification as Chairman, Civilian Protection Committee, Alert Bay, that effective February 1st, 1943 \"Dim-out\" regulations for District \"B\", in which Alert Bay is situated, go into effect. Put briefly this compels us to blackout all lighting that faces the sea, and this is going to be a problem as far as material is concerned. This dim-out will be for the duration, and it means that we will have to put in permanent shields with ventilating facilities for all our dormitories, and class rooms, as these will have to be put in at sunset and removed each morning day after day by Indian children. For such permanent blackout, only Veneer is suitable, though it need not be of #1 Grade. We have already installed three thousand feet for blackout purposes, but in our class rooms, and dormitories we had tar paper shields on wooden frames, figuring that at the worst we would only have occasional need to use them. These must now be changed, and for these 84 windows we will require 1700 square feet of 5 ply Veneer or suitable equivalent, in sheets 10' x 4'.\n\nFor your information, the school paid from grants the cost of all blackout material purchased up to this time. Now that almost as much again will be required, I am compelled to ask the Department for help in supplying this material. Mr. Indian Agent Todd is away at Campbell River, and I understand will not be back for at least a week or so, otherwise this matter would have gone through his office in the regular way. We have very little time until February 1st, as we have to construct ventilating shields in every second window to be covered.\n\nYour favourable consideration to the purchase and supply of this material at an early date will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"F. Earl Anfield\"\nPrincipal.\nJanuary 14, 1943.\n\nMr. D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nP. O.

(RG 10, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIndian Agent\nAlert Bay B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nAnswering yours of April 29th, in connection with certain items in Inspector Manning's report on this School. It is necessary to report as follows:\n\n1. The dormitory doors are locked at night for the protection of the children from outside marauders, and from the danger of the children getting in the stair-wells in the event of fire. All the dormitories are equipped with electric buzzers, and are in charge of responsible senior pupils, who can call staff members in the event of sickness and other needs during the night. We have had more than one instance of outside Indians getting into this building and into the girls' dormitories at night. I would recommend that panic-bolts approved by the Fire Underwriters Association be placed on the fire escape doors in all these dormitories.\n\n2. The question of continuing the services of the present senior class room teacher, Mr. Hannlow, in the coming Fall Term, is a matter that must be referred to the Commission in Winnipeg, from whose Offices all Staff appointments are made. I shall place this file before them, with a report, and they will in due course advise me of any decision made. The writer is aware of the unsatisfactory condition of this particular class room, and the necessity for a change in the teaching personnel thereof.\n\n3. Regarding the frame building in which the senior classes are carried on. This building is the property of the Government of Canada, and whilst we are fully aware of its condition and the urgent need of its replacement, this does not appear to be the time for any rebuilding projects. It is planned to continue the use of this building for two of our four class rooms until the end of the war, following which the situation should be then reviewed.

Engine\n\nReplying to your favour of the 14th, on the subject of replacement or repair of the above engine, we would say that some time ago our stock of Petter engines was exhausted and the Government prohibited the importation of any more.\n\nWe believe we could repair your engine so that you will get a good many years of useful life from same, providing that the major parts are not too badly worn.\n\nAbout a year ago we repaired a similar engine for the Cranbrook School which involved re boring the cylinder, making and fitting an oversize piston and the cost of this job was $259.00.\n\nIn order to do this work it will be necessary for you to send the engine in to us and we would be glad to make an inspection of same then submit a quotation. We think it very likely the work could be done for approximately the same figure as mentioned above. For your information, we would say that the prewar price of an 8 H.P. engine was $532.00.\n\nAwaiting your the favour of your reply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nB.C.EQUIPMENT CO. LTD.\nPER W. J. Roach.\nIndian Agent\nAlert Bay B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nIt is not too soon to consider the need of an extensive overhaul and repair of the Department's Petters engine used at this School in the domestic deep-well water pump.\n\nWe have not been informed of Mr. Inspector Arnall's report on this engine following his inspection of equipment at this School last fall; but, something must be done about this engine this summer, or the School will be without the means of pumping water. Mr. Arnall informed me two years ago that this engine would either have to be replaced or have extensive overhaul, and its condition today is much more serious than it was at that time.\n\nTo get an approximate figure to place before you, we wrote to the B. C. Equipment Co., Ltd., Agents for Petters engines in B. C., and to Messrs. Reliance Motor and Machine Works Ltd. Copies of this correspondence are attached herewith.\n\nYou will note that the B. C. Equipment Co. quote $259.00 for an overhaul and rebores job, and that the Reliance Company quote $60.00 for a straight rebores, including piston and rings, wrist pin and alignment; with an additional $3.20 for a spare set of rings. Both quotations are F.O.B. Vancouver.\n\nThe considerable difference in bids from these two firms would appear to be due to the fact that the B. C. Equipment Co. found that the engine referred to in their letter needed an extensive overhaul apart from the rebores job. It is certain that they would find a similar amount of work on this engine, which we know to be in need of new cam, cam-shaft and connecting rod bearing as well as a rebores.\n\nTo bring this to a head, it is respectfully suggested that Mr. Arnall be communicated with for his report and advice on this engine in the light of the correspondence herewith.\n\nIt was not possible to include an item in the current Estimates for this work, as Mr. Arnall had not inspected this equipment when the estimates were drawn up.\nThanking you for your consideration in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nApril 22, 1943.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nReplying to your letter of April 21st last in which you enclose bids for the overhaul of the Petters engine used for the domestic water supply, I wish to refer you to the enclosed report of Mr. T.G. Arnall, Engineer of the Department of Public Works, which I regret was not forwarded to you at the time the certificates were mailed.\n\nYou will note in Mr. Arnall's report he states that the fresh water pump and engine are in good condition. Possibly I am misinterpreting his report, but I understand this is the engine which he refers to.\n\nYou might advise me further in this regard before the matter is placed before the Department, as possibly something has happened to the engine in the meantime which Mr. Arnall could not foresee.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nF.E. Anfield, Esq.,\nPrincipal, St. Michael's School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nIndian Agent\nAlert Bay B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nAnswering yours of April 22nd, I am unable to reconcile Mr. Arnall's report with the condition of the Petters engine referred to therein other than to state that it is quite possible that on the day of his inspection the engine referred to was running presumably in good condition. I have discussed this engine with Mr. Arnall for the past two years, and there has been agreement that extensive repairs would be essential this summer. Only by careful handling has this engine continued to give good service, and we dare not risk another winter without a complete overhaul. The engine has a piston-slap that is a positive warning of impending trouble.\n\nIt will be appreciated if you will consider our previous letter in the light of the information contained herein.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\n\n[Stamp] INDIAN COMMISSIONER\n\nMAY 7 1943\n\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nMay 4th, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M.

Public Works, Canada,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nRe: Indian Residential School - Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nOn looking over the voluminous stack of correspondence regarding the Fresh Water Pumps and Diesel Engines at the Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, B.C., I cannot see that Mr. Anfield could do anything other than ask for prices for the repair of this Engine.\n\nIn my report, dated November 2nd, 1940, I recommended that the cylinder be re bored and new piston fitted and that the pump be drawn from the well and overhauled.\n\nOn my next visit to the school, September 10th, 1941, I was informed that the pump and engine had been overhauled and were in good condition.\n\nOn my visit to the School, October 22nd and 23rd, 1942, the engine was started up in my presence with no trouble and the exhaust was practically clear. There was a slight pin-knock, but not enough to cause any serious trouble. There is a possibility that after six months' operation, this knock has developed further.\n\nI can quite understand Mr. Anfield's position in this matter, which he has discussed with me on several occasions. The whole school depends on this deep well for its whole domestic water supply and should the engine or pump give out, a very serious situation will develop.\n\nThis pump and engine should at all times be kept in the best of condition, or, better, a duplicate unit be purchased and installed.\n\nThe price quoted by the Reliance Motor Works appears quite reasonable. Of course, there might be some other minor repairs needed, but from what I saw of the engine last fall, I do not think any will be required. However, what might have developed during the last six months I am not in a position to say, but for reasons given will emphasize that both pump and engine be kept in first-class condition.\n\nT.J.

Also, the report of the Public Works Engineer, Mr. Arnall, recommending the repairs in question.\n\nIt will be noted that there are two quotations for this work, one being that of the Reliance Motor Works for $65.20, and the other, that of the B.C. Equipment, Limited, Agents for the Engine, for a complete overhaul estimated to cost somewhere in the neighbourhood of $260.00, this being based on the amount of work that was necessary for an Engine of the same make and type recently overhauled for the Cranbrook Residential School. However, it will be noted that Mr. Arnall appears to favour the quotation of the Reliance Motor Works and if funds can be provided for this purpose I would recommend that the expenditure be approved and the work carried out during the summer holidays.\n\nD.M.

MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing correspondence with reference to the installation of a furnace in the old classroom block at the Alert Bay Residential School.\n\nTaking everything into consideration in regard to this building, the Department considers it undesirable to incur the expenditure that would be necessary to install the furnace and consequently favourable consideration cannot be given to the Principal's request.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Todd's letter of the 8th instant forwarding Principal Anfield's letter of the 2nd instant requesting the provision of a furnace for the old classroom block at Alert Bay Residential School.\n\nI would point out that at the request of the Principal two box heaters were provided for this block at a cost of $50.70 to provide a stand-by in the event that the fuel oil supply for the existing burners was shut off during the present shortage. This building is used for classrooms only and constant heating is not required.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I am not prepared to recommend any expenditure for new furnaces for this building.\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJuly 8, 1943.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Department of Mines & Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nReplying to your letter of June 18th last, file 215-6-4955 in which you refer to an expenditure of $1,250.00 for new furnaces in the old classroom block of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, as requested, I discussed this matter verbally with Principal Anfield and at that time we were both of the opinion as this building has been condemned by the School Inspector, and from what knowledge we have ourselves of its condition, it would be unwarranted to attempt to spend any further money on it as no doubt it will have to be torn down immediately the war is over.\n\nThe Department recently purchased small box wood stoves and supplied Principal Anfield with brick so that the building could be used in case the oil supply was cut off, and there is also the other alternative of using the auditorium in the main building as recommended by the Department some time ago. In any case, I am opposed to spending any further money on this old building, and after our discussion was somewhat surprised to receive the enclosed letter from Principal Anfield in which he recommends that a hot-air furnace be installed, provided it could be transferred to a new classroom unit at a later date. Once a hot-air furnace is installed there is very little chance of using it for re-installation, therefore I am opposed to this.\n\nI would recommend that no action be taken in respect to this expenditure, and that Principal Anfield be requested to use the facilities now made available to him by the Department.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\nIndian Agent\nAlert Bay B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nFurther to our conversation of today's date, it is noted that an item for $1250.00 approximately has been included in the estimates sanctioned for the purchase of a furnace for the Classroom block, formerly the Girls Home.\n\nFollowing the condemnation of the steam heating plant formerly in use in this building, oil stoves were purchased by the Department, and installed in the classrooms. No heat was provided for the hallways or store rooms used in this building. A year ago there was a distinct possibility that no further oil supplies would be available and two small wood stoves were purchased by the Department should oil fuel be cut off. At present only two classrooms are used in this building, but some 8 or 10 other rooms are used as store rooms of various kinds.\n\nAt the recent inspection of this School, this building was condemned as a fire trap, and should oil supplies be cut off, the fire risk in this building would be even more enhanced by the use of small box stoves, and I would be most unwilling to sanction their use at all.\n\nIt is presumed that the $1250.00 sanctioned is for a hot-air furnace on which a bid was received from the Nimkish Sheet Metal Co. some two years ago. This bid included equipment to heat three classrooms, and the main hallways. Apart from the actual furnace the job would be a sheet metal project, and the hot and cold air vents would have to be constructed and fitted into the building as it is at present.\n\nFrom the point of view of fire risk such a hot-air furnace would be a good safety measure, though it should be remembered that the building is condemned and that it will be likely torn down as soon as wartime conditions permit.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 17th, your file 156-0-5, regarding the Provincial Inspector's report on the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, I beg to enclose herewith Mr. Todd's letter of the 7th instant forwarding Mr. Anfield's letter of June 5th, in which the Principal advises of the precautions taken to minimize the fire hazard in the old building used for classroom purposes.\n\nD.

S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\nIndian Agent  \nAlert Bay B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\u2014\n\nWith reference our conversation about fire protection at the classroom block of this School, it is necessary to advise as follows:\n\n1. We recognize that this building is a fire trap, but consider that unless it is immediately demolished it is safer to keep it in use.\n\n2. The building is kept under constant supervision by day and by night, and is kept locked when classrooms are not in session.\n\n3. Regular drills are carried out from the building, which can be emptied during school hours in a couple of minutes.\n\n4. There are two hydrant houses within 50 yards of this block; the hoses are kept coupled at all times to the hydrant, and there is a constant supply of water in the lines.\n\nIt is recognized that we could hardly save the building should it catch fire, but with the protection mentioned herewith I think we could manage to keep it from spreading to other parts of the plant, including the main school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFEA/dmw  \nPRINCIPAL\nSupplies mentioned hereunder have been received and found satisfactory with exception of those listed under \"Remarks\".\n\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION | UNIT | TOTAL |\n|----------|-------------|------|-------|\n| 30 only  | Institution Beds, 6' x 3' | Each | $10.80 | $324.00 |\n| 25       | Institution All Felt Mattresses | Each | $6.00 | $150.00 |\n| 30       | Pillows, all feather, in A.O.C. ticking | Each | $1.00 | $30.00 |\n\nPlease prepay transportation charges and attach receipted shipping invoices to regular invoices.\n\nDate: June 27/43\n\nShipping Instructions:\nIndian Residential School,\n\nVote: Primary\n\nEncumbrance No.: 479\n\nFreight or Express charges paid:\n\nRemarks: (Report shortages, if any)\n\nBranch: Date: TO BE RETURNED TO HEAD OF BRANCH Signature of Receiving Officer\nOttawa,\nJune 11, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M.

The requisition is being forwarded to the Departmental Purchasing Agent. For your information I may say that in the current year's appropriation an amount of $1050.00 is provided for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment. We have already authorized approximately $125.00 for repairs to the engines at the school and to this expenditure will be added the cost of the beds, mattresses and pillows.\n\nIn addition, we have provided an amount of $1250.00 for new furnaces in the classroom block. This was brought to our attention last year and I believe was included in the current year's estimates submitted by the Principal. It would be appreciated if you would communicate with Indian Agent Todd and decide if new furnaces are needed. If so, you might let me have an estimate of the cost of their installation.\n\nR.A.

Present indications are that several hundred dollars of this amount will remain unexpended due to the impossibility of getting material, and it is hoped by the Commission that your recommendation would enable the Department to give special consideration to the payment of this item.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\n| Year | Month | Description                                      | Amount |\n|------|-------|-------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1942 | June  | To Driving Grid.

(RG 10, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nAs you are aware, our unloading wharf was destroyed last winter in a heavy south-east gale. No request was made for replacement as the labour situation in Alert Bay was becoming more hopeless each year and it was almost impossible to get men to unload the scows of slabs on the wharf. The Telegraph Cove people, from whom we purchase our fuel supply (600 cords of slabs per year) were of the opinion that they could put in an unloading derrick at Sharpe's boat shop and they spent considerable money trying to work this out. We brought in two test scow loads and we find that the cost of unloading and hauling is exactly double the previous system and as the handling of the derrick will require at least four men I have abandoned the idea entirely.\n\nThe only solution is a grid at the site of the previous School dock on which the scow can be placed and a truck run right onto same and slabs loaded thereon by the driver, requiring only one man.\n\nI have been trying to get the pile driver man for over two months, but unsuccessfully until this week, when he arrived with the driver to do some work at the Cannery. As we were down to less than a month's supply of slabs, I have instructed him to proceed at once to put in this grid and have secured the necessary material from Telegraph Cove. The driving will cost approx. $100.00 less materials, 22 piles, 6 heavy cross timbers, drift bolts etc.\n\nWould it be asking too much for the Department to make a grant of $100.00 towards this job and we will absorb the balance through School grants. I realise this is not the regular way to do this, but had to get action on this problem at once, as the driver may not be back for months and we must get 500 cords of slabs piled this summer without fail in order to have reasonably dry fuel for the winter.\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nYour help in this will be appreciated. In the meantime we shall have to pay the cost and hope that the grant requested can be used as a refund.\n\nThanking you,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPrincipal.\n\nFEA/B.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Can.\n\nI enclose you, herewith, correspondence which has taken place over the erection of a Grid built on the foreshore in front of St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, B. C.\n\nI regret very much to have to place this whole matter before the department, particularly since Principal Anfield has been appointed Indian Agent of Bella Coola, but in view of the circumstances under which this Grid was built, I have no alternative since Principal Anfield has forwarded me his letter of October 1st, 1943 enclosing an account apparently assumed on behalf of the Residential School, and asked that I place the matter before the department. As this whole matter was irregular from its inception, it is necessary for me to go into detail so that the department will know exactly what has taken place from the beginning.\n\nIn the month of October, 1941, Principal Anfield informed me it was too costly to handle their slab wood by unloading it on the school dock which the department had rebuilt at a cost of Two Hundred Twenty-Five Dollars ($225.00) a short time previous to this at the request of Principal Anfield, for this purpose, and asked if I thought the department would object to a Grid being built on the foreshore alongside the dock by the Telegraph Cove Mills for this purpose.\n\nAt that time Principal Anfield stated the Grid would be completed by the Telegraph Cove Mills and the School at no cost to the department, as it was to their interests to find a cheaper way of handling their fuel. It seemed it would benefit both the Telegraph Cove Mills and the School as Mr. Anfield was purchasing the slabs from them, and it was for this reason that they planned discarding the wharf provided by the department for this use and building a Grid in its place.\n\nI informed Mr. Anfield at the time that as it was only a matter of providing a very few piles and the placing of a few timbers to rest the scow on, that I did not think the department would have any objections; but as Mr. Anfield made no application for permission to be forwarded to the department in order to obtain their approval for the building of this Grid, no action was taken in the matter.\n\nDuring the month of December 1941 while I was in hospital in Vancouver, a very severe storm struck Alert Bay with the result that the wharf which we had only recently rebuilt was taken out entirely and allowed to drift away. After I returned to duty and was able to get around I noticed the wharf was missing and asked Mr. Anfield what\nhad happened. He informed me of the circumstances and at the same time told me he and Fred Wastell of the Telegraph Cove Mills arranged with Mr. Goodrow to put in a Grid, but made no mention of the department paying for same.\n\nOn June 13th, 1942 I received the enclosed letter from Principal Anfield, in which you will please note he asked at that time for the department to make a grant towards the work of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00), and further stated \"In the meantime we shall have to pay the cost and hope that the grant requested can be used as a refund\".\n\nKnowing the circumstances from the beginning that it was the intention of the Telegraph Cove Mills and Principal Anfield to build this Grid and arrange for the wood in order that their costs could be recouped, I informed Principal Anfield that as the department had not been consulted and their permission and authority obtained, I could not consider placing it before Ottawa with the recommendation that this be paid.\n\nOn June 24, 1943, Mr. Goodrow came to my office and told me Fred Wastell had informed him the Government was paying for the building of the Grid. I asked Mr. Goodrow who had employed him and what arrangements he had, and was informed as follows. He stated Fred Wastell of the Telegraph Cove Mills employed him to build this Grid for them and that they would pay for same as it was being used for their benefit in getting the scows unloaded quicker and less costly. Mr. Goodrow also informed me that Principal Anfield at the Residential School had nothing to do with it in any way and that it was entirely Telegraph Cove Mills' responsibility, and that he was looking to the Telegraph Cove Mills for payment.\n\nSince the Grid was built the R.C.A.F. have taken over the Telegraph Cove Mills and they are now supplying wood to the Residential School and through this new arrangement the Telegraph Cove Mills have no further use for the Grid.\n\nThe department can draw their own conclusions from the above information and why the Government is now being asked to pay for this Grid. You will also please note in the statement submitted by Principal Anfield the price has now gone up from One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) to One Hundred Fifty Dollars ($150.00).\n\nAs stated above the whole procedure has been irregular and it appears to me the parties responsible for the building of this Grid are now trying to get the department to pay for something which they have no right to do so. I regret very much that Principal Anfield has associated himself with a deal of this kind, but as stated above I have no alternative but to submit same to the Department and recommend against any payment being made or the account being honoured in any respect. In my opinion it is the responsibility of the Telegraph Cove Mills who Mr. Goodrow states employed him to do this work and stated they would pay him for same.\n\n(M.S.

C.\n\nIn Agency Estimates for 1943-44 Principal Anfield of St. Michael's Residential School, included an item for a quantity of paint for his Manual Training under B. C. Special Vote, Technical Education and later the department ruled that this paint did not come under this vote and, therefore, it was deleted.\n\nFor the department's information, this paint was requested for maintenance of the school building and the work was to be done by pupils of the school as a Manual Training Project, due to the fact that labour was difficult to obtain and also with a view to economizing. I am in agreement with the principal's views with regard to the maintenance of the school, as I do not wish to see the building deteriorate.\n\nThe Acting Principal has now submitted a requisition, which we enclose herewith, for the same quantity of paint to be supplied for the same purpose but charged under the vote provided for repairs, and I would recommend that the same be approved by the department. The work will still be done by the pupils as a Manual Training Project.\n\n(M. S.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAlert Bay, B. C.,\nFeb. 5th, 1944.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B. C., Department of Mines and Resources, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nUnder date of December 29th last Rev. S. J. Wickens, Principal of St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, came to me reporting the vertical high pressure steam boiler in the school, used by the laundry and kitchen, had blown several more tubes out, and upon further examination found it necessary to re-tube the boiler.\n\nAs the school was in session it was necessary that immediate action be taken to get this equipment operating at the earliest possible moment, and I instructed Mr. Wickens to purchase, if possible, the necessary tubes at once. This action was taken by myself rather than wait to refer the matter to Ottawa as I felt this was what the department would expect me to do in an emergency of this nature. I also felt that with the shortage of materials it might be possible that we could not obtain them immediately, and the sooner the order was placed the sooner the equipment would be back in operation.\n\nWe were fortunate in obtaining these tubes immediately, which were supplied by the firm who sold us the boiler originally. I enclose you, herewith, voucher #300, covering the cost of same, and would recommend that it be paid as submitted.\n\n(Ms. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncs.\n\nExtra c.c. enclosed.\nIndian Agent\nAlert Bay B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nI regret to report that our vertical high pressure steam boiler is out of commission.\n\nWe have had two or three individual tubes plugged in the past because of leakage, but yesterday a group of tubes blew out. The expert examination by a master mechanic revealed that all the tubes, numbering 67, are due for renewal. This boiler was installed in 1935; the first burst occurred in 1942 and an overhaul was to be expected.\n\nAs a result of the closing down of its operation, the dryer in our laundry is affected, as well as the steamer in our kitchen.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would authorize the renewal of all of the tubes and provide for such work to be done at the earliest opportunity.\n\nI am, yours very truly,\n\nS. J. Wickers,\nPrincipal.\nAlert Bay, B. C.,\nFeb. 25th, 1944.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B. C., Department of Mines and Resources, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nThe enclosed voucher #327 in favor of Mr. C. Ingard, 307 - W. 17th Ave., Vancouver, B. C., is for labour in connection with the retubing of the high pressure steam boiler at St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, and was employed by Rev. S. J. Wickens, Principal, to do the work.\n\nThis work was of an emergency nature and while I was asked by the Principal if the department would pay for this labour, I told him I could not approve of same without first taking it up with the department and obtaining their approval. My own opinion was that when the department supplied the tubes their own engineer should have done the work, but as it now appears, it was a harder job than anticipated. I feel the engineer could not have done it alone and, therefore, in view of the circumstances I would recommend that the department pay the account, as I understand we have sufficient money on hand to do so.\n\nIf the department approves of same I would request that the cheque be forwarded to the above mentioned:\n\nC. Ingard,\n307 - W. 17th Ave.,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nThe attached letter from Mr. Wickens will be self-explanatory.\n\n(M. S.

In advising Mr. Todd and making out the purchase order 29025 A an error was made in showing the amount authorized as $72.20 instead of $63.20 as authorized. Mr. Todd was duly advised of this and instructed to bear this in mind when submitting the voucher.

We asked the company for the receipted freight bill on March 17th and received it only today. In the meantime, in order to expedite payment of the larger amount, we forwarded Voucher No.349 to the Department with the amount of the freight struck off.\n\nIt is noted that the invoice is dated February 15th while the Union Steamships Ltd., have stamped the Bill of Lading that they received the 55\u00a2 on April 8th. It is recommend that this amount be paid from last year's appropriation although the receipt is dated April 8th. It has been explained by merchants previously, at Vancouver, that they have charge accounts with the transportation companies and frequently pay the prepaid freight charges on several shipments at the end of the month in a lump sum. When they ask for separate receipts on an individual shipment, the company stamps on the date on which the receipt is secured.\n\nVoucher No.60-A was prepared in this office, because of the time that would elapse, if we sent the receipt to Mr. Todd and waited until the voucher was prepared in his office and returned to Vancouver.\n\nFor D.

I, therefore, instructed Principal Wickens to obtain tenders for same, as I consider in the interests of protection for the school, that this should be replaced at once.\n\nIn checking up my estimates I find that no provision was made by the School for this replacement, therefore, the funds may have to be supplied from some other request which has not been used up.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would give this your early attention as I am somewhat worried over this situation existing longer than necessary.\n\n(M.S.

(RG 10, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Powers No. 11 Regulator\n\nType and Use\nThis is a self-operating regulator for the control of liquid temperatures in either heating or cooling operations. It is of rugged construction and has been designed to give years of service with a minimum of expense.\n\nIt may be used on steam heated hot water tanks, vats, kettles, dye machines, bleach tubs, pickling vats, acid baths, plating tanks, fuel oil preheaters, milk can and bottle coolers, sugar juice heaters, feed water heaters, Diesel oil preheating vats, sewage treaters, digesters, etc. It may also be used to control liquids used as cooling mediums in drinking water systems, jet condensers, etc. See page 11 for typical applications.\n\nConstruction and Operation\nThe No. 11 Regulator is of all metal construction, simple in design, and easy to install. Its thermostatic bulb contains a sensitive fluid, hermetically sealed, which generates a pressure in proportion to the temperature of the liquid in contact with the bulb. This pressure is conducted through the flexible connecting tubing to the all metal bellows diaphragm in the operating head, which responds by gradually closing or opening the valve to maintain the desired temperature.\n\nTemperature Range and Adjustment\nThe No. 11 Regulator is furnished standard for any specified operating temperature between the limits of 60\u00b0 and 250\u00b0 F. It can be furnished in sizes \u00bc-inch to 3\u00bd-inch, inclusive, where frequent and accurate resetting is necessary, a dial adjustment regulator (page 5) is recommended. Regulators for operation between 40\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 F are furnished with spring and collar adjustment only. A lock for the spring and collar adjustment feature can be provided at extra cost.\n\nTypes of Valves\nThe No. 11 Regulator is furnished standard with a direct acting (spring opened) valve for the control of heating mediums. For the control of cooling mediums it is furnished with a reverse acting (spring closed) valve. It may also be furnished with a three-way valve for mixing hot and cold water or for diverting the flow of a heating or cooling medium (see page 6).\n\nValve Construction (See figure 8)\nThe \u00bc-inch and \u00bd-inch valves are made of steam bronze and are of the low pressure single seat composition globe pattern with double unions. Sizes \u00be-inch to 1\u00bd-inch, inclusive, are made of steam bronze and are of the double-seated balanced type with double unions. Where steam pressures permit, they can also be furnished in the double union single seat composition disc type.\n\nHigh Steam Pressures\nWhen the pressure of the steam to be controlled is above 75 pounds, stainless steel trimmed valves are recommended. For steam pressures above 200 pounds or for total steam temperatures above 500\u00b0 F., steel valves with stainless steel seats and poppets must be used.\n\nWhen so ordered the Powers No. 11 regulator can be safeguarded for a specified over-run in temperature.\n\nExtension Bonnet\nWhen the regulator is to be fitted at a temperature below 200\u00b0 F. or if the valve is to be insulated where moisture may accumulate and freeze on the packing gland and valve stem, an extension bonnet is recommended. The use of this extension bonnet also permits a neater job of pipe covering.\n\nThermostatic Bulb\nThe standard bulb is made of copper and is for use in water and other non-corrosive liquids. For corrosive solutions or gases, a bulb of special material can be supplied (at extra cost) when full information is given regarding the corrosive agent, its concentration, and the temperature at which the solution is to be maintained.\n\nThe standard bulb has a pipe thread tank bushing and retainer nut and a straight flexible tubing connection (see figures 1 and 2); a flange connection will be substituted when required. Bulbs of special design can be furnished if required; a sketch and complete details should accompany requests for prices. Figures 4 and 5 on page 4 show two special bulbs.\n\nSeparable Well\nTo permit removal of the bulb without draining the tank, vat or pipe line, a separable well or socket can be supplied at extra cost but its use retards the action of the regulator to some extent. Where temperature changes are quite slow the interference offered by a well is negligible, but where accurate indication is required and temperature changes are fairly rapid a well should not be used.\nWet Bulb Control\n\nBy covering the bulb of the No. 11 Regulator with a wick kept saturated in an overhead or automatic water pan, the No. 11 Regulator may be used as a wet bulb instrument. A chromium plated style W bulb will be furnished for this service. If the dry bulb is to be mounted on the water pan it should be of the same type of construction. This has an insulating bushing which decreases heat transfer.\n\nFlexible Tubing\n\nStandard flexible tubing is made of copper with bronze protective sheathing. Standard lengths are shown in the price list on page 10 and in the tables of dimensions on page 9; additional lengths may be had at extra cost. Tubing is available to resist the corrosion action of various chemicals can also be specified. Another tubing with nickel finish will resist mild acid fumes. Smooth bendable monel or stainless steel tubing can also be furnished, but the best protection for tubing is lead sheathing (see Item 26 and 30 in the price list).\n\nThe No. 11 Regulator can be furnished without flexible tubing. It is then identified as the Powers No. 11 Regulator and is described in Bulletin No. 241.\n\nCautions\n\nTo prevent results the steam pressure should be kept constant and as low as possible.\n\nTo prolong the life of the regulator and prevent temperature variations due to dirt or sediment lodging between the valve disc and seat, a self-cleaning strainer should be installed in the supply line to the valve. If the steam contains a large amount of moisture or condensate, a steam trap should be installed just ahead of the regulator. See page 7 for strainers and Bulletin No. 253 for traps.\n\nHow to Order (Prices shown on page 10)\n\nDescribe clearly the process or operation to be controlled and specify:\n\n(A) Valve size.\n(B) Type of valve: Direct acting (spring opened), reverse acting (spring closed), or three-way (for mixing or diverting).\n(C) Valve: Single seat, balanced, stainless steel trimmed, or cast iron.\n(D) Type of adjustment: Spring and collar, lever and weight, or dial.\n(E) Is valve to handle steam, water, gas, oil, or brine?\n(F) Pressure and temperature of heating or cooling medium to be handled by valve.\n(G) Operating temperature.\n(H) Range of temperature adjustment.\n(I) Is regulator to have dial thermometer mounted on operating head? If so, state difference in elevation between bulb and thermometer head.\n(J) Liquid in which bulb will be immersed, and its concentration.\n(K) Bulb material: Monel, nickel, steel, nickel plated, chromium plated, lead sheathed (copper, monel, nickel or steel), silver soldered (copper or monel).\n(L) Is bulb to have straight or angle flexible tubing connection?\n(M) Tank material: Brass or same metal as bulb.\n(N) Is bulb to be installed horizontally, vertically pointing upward, or vertically pointing downward?\n(O) Length of flexible tubing.\n(P) Any special features.\n\nThe Powers Dial Adjustment No. 11 Regulator\n\nType and Use\n\nThis regulator is of the same design and construction as the Powers standard No. 11 Regulator (pages 2 to 4), except that it is provided with dial adjustment to facilitate changing the temperature setting over close limits. The use of different style thermostatic bulbs (see figures 9 to 12 below) also makes the regulator suitable for the control of atmospheric, liquid, wet bulb and dew point temperatures.\n\nThis regulator may also be furnished with an indicating thermometer mounted on the operating head.\n\nValve Construction (See page 4)\n\nThe regulator is made in valve sizes \u00bc-inch, \u00bd-inch, \u00be-inch and 1\u00bd-inch only. It is furnished standard with a valve seat of double and single seat pattern, and can be had in the direct acting (spring opened), reverse acting (spring closed), or three-way type. In the three-way pattern the bottom port is screwed.\n\nTemperature Range and Adjustment\n\nThe regulator is furnished standard for a specified operating temperature between the limits of 60\u00b0 and 250\u00b0F, and has a range of adjustment of approximately 20\u00b0. To obtain this range and to permit ease of adjustment and accurate resetting, a fine pitch scale is used. As six complete turns of the adjustment knob are required to cover the entire temperature band, two scales are provided: a vernier scale marked numerically, A to G, inclusive; and a circular dial (marked off in five divisions). After the regulator is installed, it may be calibrated and dial readings recorded with these separate temperature scales. This makes it possible to easily reset the regulator for any predetermined temperature.\n\nHow to Order\n\nIn addition to the information called for on page 4, please specify style of bulb (B, D, F or G), and straight or angle flexible tubing connection.\n\nList Price\n\nSee Items 15 and 16 in the price list on page 10.\n\nDimensions\n\nSee tables on page 9 and notes below tables.\n\nThermostatic Bulbs for Use with Dial Adjustment No. 11 Regulator\n\n| Valve Size, Inches | \u00bc | \u00bd | \u00be | 1\u00bd |\n|-------------------|---|---|---|----|\n| Style B and D Bulbs | A (60\u00b0-250\u00b0), inches* | 8 | 8 | 13 | 13 |\n| B (125\u00b0-250\u00b0), inches* | 8 | 8 | 13 | 13 |\n| B (60\u00b0-125\u00b0), inches* | 15 | 15 | 22 | 22 |\n| Style F and G Bulbs | A (60\u00b0-250\u00b0), inches | 12 | 12 | 15 | 15 |\n| B (125\u00b0-250\u00b0), inches | 8 | 8 | 13 | 13 |\n| B (60\u00b0-125\u00b0), inches | 15 | 15 | 22 | 22 |\n\n*Ball length (D) will be reduced one-inch from nominal diameter (A) to fit 1-inch pipe thread connection on style D bulb will then be 1-inch.\n\nAny of these bulbs may be had either with straight or angle flexible tubing connection, but the type illustrated will be furnished unless otherwise specified.\nThe Powers No. 11 Regulator with Three-Way Valve\n\nType and Use\nThe regulator is designed to mix hot and cold water and deliver the mixture at a constant temperature. It is used for supplying tempered water to wash sinks and basins, for mixing brine in evaporators, industrial processes, etc. It is also used for mixing or diverting the flow of brine in cooling operations. It is not intended for shower use.\n\nValve Construction (See page 8)\nSizes 1/2-inch to 2-inch, inclusive, have bronze bodies with screwed connections. Sizes 3/4-inch to 1 1/2-inch, inclusive, can also be furnished with union connection and flanged ends. Sizes 1-inch to 2 1/2-inch and 3-inch have iron bodies with screwed connection on all three ports, but can be furnished with flanged side and screwed end connections, at an extra cost. Valves are flanged on all three ports and tempered at extra cost in sizes 2 1/2-inch to 4-inch. Sizes 3/4-inch and up have vanes fitted with special skirted design to prevent \"hunting.\"\n\nExtension Bonnet\nWhen the regulator is to control at a temperature below 20\u00b0 F, or if the valve is to be installed where moisture may accumulate and freeze on the packing gland and valve stem, an extension bonnet is recommended. The use of this extension bonnet also permits a neater job of pipe covering.\n\nTemperature Range and Adjustment\nThe standard regulator is furnished for an operating temperature of 140\u00b0 F, and has an adjustment range of approximately 20\u00b0 above and below this point. Any other 40\u00b0 range between 60\u00b0 and 200\u00b0 F can be further specified, at no additional cost. It can be furnished in sizes 1/2-inch to 2 1/2-inch, inclusive, for operation between 40\u00b0 and 200\u00b0 F, at extra cost.\n\nWater Pressure\nFor best results the hot and cold water pressures must be approximately equal. If one pressure is considerably higher than the other, a suitable reducing valve must be used (see Bulletin No. 256).\n\nCautions\nCheck valves should always be installed in both supply lines to prolong the life of the regulator and prevent temperature variations due to dirt or sediment lodging between the valve disc and seat. Self-cleaning strainers should be installed in both supply lines to the regulator (see Bulletin No. 256). Whenever possible regulator should be installed in a mixing position in preference to diverting.\n\nList Prices\nSee Item 6 in the price list on page 10.\n\nDimensions\nSee Table VII on page 9 and notes below table.\n\n---\n\nThe Powers No. 11 Indicating Regulator\n\nTo properly check the performance of a regulator and to determine the temperature being maintained by it, the bulb of the thermometer must be installed directly adjacent to the thermostat element of the regulator. This requires an additional tapping in the tank, pipe line or vat, and if it is in a location where a standard thermometer cannot easily be read, a more expensive remote bulb thermometer must be used.\n\nTo eliminate the expense of the tapped remote opening and special remote bulb thermometer, the Powers No. 11 Indicating Regulator offers as one instrument with a single bulb and tube system a reliable regulator and an easily read dial thermometer.\n\nList Price\u2014See Item 7 in the price list on page 10.\n\nDimensions\u2014See Table VI on page 9 and notes below tables.\n\n---\n\nThe Powers No. 11 Sprinkler Tank Regulator\n\nHeaters used to prevent freezing of the water in sprinkler tanks must be of sufficient capacity to maintain a temperature of at least 40\u00b0 F. in the tank at all times. Considerable heating when the water may become badly contaminated, causing a great waste of water. The Powers Sprinkler Tank No. 11 Regulator will keep the temperature of the water at 40\u00b0 at all times. See figure 29, page 11, for typical installation.\n\nThis regulator has a bulb incased in a well which permits the removal of the bulb from the tank without shutting off the water and draining the tank. A small hole drilled through the seat well of the valve permits a slight flow of steam at all times, even when the valve is in a closed position.\n\nIn ordering specify valve size, steam pressure, operating temperature, length of flexible tubing and type of heater (single, multiple or radiator type).\n\nList Price\u2014See Item 8 in the price list on page 10.\n\nDimensions\u2014See Table VI on page 9 and notes below tables.\n\nThis regulator is approved by the Factory Mutual Laboratories.\n\n---\n\nThe Powers Self-Cleaning Strainer\n\nFor use on pipes carrying water, air, gas, oil or steam.

It is unequalled for heavy duty.\n\nComfort and Safety Features\n\nPressure Equalizing Valve (Figure 3-140). Without this important feature a Powers mixer would be simply another shower mixer. This valve is a floating piston which controls and equalizes the mixture of hot and cold water before they enter the mixing chamber.\n\nIt safeguards the bather from scalding and annoying temperature changes caused by pressure variations in supply lines due to use of nearby showers, faucets and flush valves. It substantially shuts off hot water if cold water supply fails.\n\nSafety Stop Screw (Figure 2-140). This screw can be used to limit the delivery temperature of the shower, thereby preventing the possibility of scalding caused by a \"dead end\" in the hot water supply.\n\nCheck Valves (Figure 5-140) are built into both inlets to prevent backsiphonage or interchanging of hot and cold water.\n\nEconomies\u2014While the first cost of Powers Mixers is higher than that of hand valves and most mechanical mixers, their many advantages make them a much more profitable investment.\n\nBy providing safety features, they prevent damaging public liability and expensive lawsuits caused by accidents to bathers injured in ordinary showers.\n\nNo time or water is wasted while bathers wait for showers to become hot or cool off to the right temperature.\n\nExtra large supply pipes, often used to minimize dangerous pressure changes, are unnecessary when Powers Mixers are used.\n\nConstruction\u2014Powers Mixers are ruggedly built of heavy castings with all internal working parts chromium plated to resist corrosion and wear. They have no thermostatic coils, no diaphragms, and no composition valve seat washers on hot water inlet to prevent leak and need frequent replacement.\n\nTheir sturdy all metal construction insures a durability not equaled by any other mixer.\n\nHow the Pressure Equalizing Valve Works\n\nSimplified Diagrams Showing Cross-Section of Shower Mixer\n\nWARM WATER 105\u00b0 F.\n\n| Hot water pressure 40 lbs. | Cold water pressure 40 lbs. |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Pressure                  | Pressure                  |\n| 10 lbs.                   | 10 lbs.                   |\n\nFigure 6-140. Supply pressures equal.\n\nPressure Equalizing Valve A is a floating piston carrying on each end valves BB, which control the admission of the hot and cold water to mixing chamber C.\n\nTo illustrate the operation of this valve let us assume that the pressure of hot and cold water supply is 40 lbs., and that the handle of the mixer has been turned to the position where the temperature of mixed water delivered to shower is 105\u00b0 F.\n\nAs long as the pressures of both hot and cold water supply are equal, the piston will occupy the neutral position illustrated above.\n\nIf pressure of cold water suddenly drops to 10 lbs., as shown in Figure 5-140, due to use of nearby showers or flush valves, the preponderance of hot water pressure instantly moves the piston sufficiently so that valves BB, by proportionately restricting the higher and favoring the lower pressure, maintain in the mixing chamber C the perfect balance of pressures necessary to maintain the temperature at 105\u00b0 F.\n\nComplete failure of either supply substantially cuts off the other. See Figure 6-140 which illustrates position of piston with complete failure of cold water supply. Spring shown is non-corrosive and is used only as an additional safeguard to insure instant closing of hot water valve when cold water supply fails.\n\nFigure 7-140 shows position of piston with hot water supply suddenly reduced to 10 lbs. Because pressures of hot and cold water flowing to the mixing chambers are perfectly balanced, temperature of shower remains constant at 105\u00b0 F.\nPowers Safety Shower Mixers\n\nThe Powers Safety Shower Mixer is made in three styles:\n\n- **Style A** for exposed installation only.\n- **Style B** for concealed installation where the mixer is accessible from the rear.\n- **Style C** for concealed installation where the mixer is accessible from the front only.\n\n**Connections\u2014**\n- **Style A** has female connection without union at outlet. Style B and C have male connection with union at outlet. Style A can be furnished with male connection and union at outlet, when specified, without extra cost. All mixers have standard straight union inlet connections; elbow connections will be substituted if specified.\n\n**Shut-Off Valve\u2014** This mixer has a built-in shut-off valve.\n\n**Standard Finish** is chromium plated. Style A has dial, handle, stem, bonnet, and union connections highly polished; body is plated but not polished. Styles B and C have all exposed parts highly polished.\n\nSpecial finishes can be furnished if required. Prices on application.\n\n**Special Dials and Handles\u2014** Octagonal dials and handles can be furnished for Styles B and C without extra charge.\n\n**Prison type handle** which cannot be removed for use as a safety device is available at no extra charge for any style mixer. It is secured to the mixer by a pin with a flush head requiring a special wrench to remove it.\n\n**Strainers\u2014** To protect shower mixers and heads from dirt, grit, scale, etc., Powers self-cleaning strainers (page 35) should be installed in hot and cold water supply lines of mixer. We also furnish chromium plated brass strainer tees for the Style A mixer (see roughing-in dimensions and price list).\n\n### Capacities\n\n(Based on delivery temperature of 180\u00b0F)\n\n| Size       | Minimum Hot or Cold Water Pressure, Pounds | Gallons Per Minute |\n|------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| 1-inch mixer | 10                                      | 25                  |\n| 1-inch mixer | 15                                      | 40                  |\n| 1-inch mixer | 20                                      | 60                  |\n| 1-inch mixer | 25                                      | 75                  |\n| 1-inch mixer | 30                                      | 90                  |\n\nNOTE: For complete capacity data see page 36.\n\n### How to Order\u2014State proposed use and specify:\n\n(A) Style of mixer; A, B, C, knee operated, or elbow operated.

If wall flange is required (see Item 2 in price list), specify diameter from center of flange to wall. However, the 1-inch mixer will be furnished with the 2\u00bd-inch minimum dimension. All \u00be-inch and 1-inch mixers with the 3\u00bd-inch minimum dimension.\n\nAll dimensions of 1-inch mixer are same as \u00be-inch except that inlets and outlet are 1-inch; and when furnished with strainer tees, pipe centers will be 10\u00bd inches.\n\n### Style B for Concealed Piping Accessible from the Rear\n\nNeck of mixer is provided with a 1\u00bd-inch extension to accommodate thickness of marble slab, tile or panel. Has chromium plated finish, with exposed parts highly polished.\nStyle C for Concealed Piping Accessible only from the Front\n\nThis style has a metal box to be inserted in wall flush with surface, to receive pipe connections and mixer. The box is springing fitted and when removed makes mixer accessible. Has chromium plated finish with exposed parts highly polished. For thin partitions, the \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch box only can be furnished with a shelf 3 inches deep.\n\nTypical Installations of Safety Shower Mixers\n\nThe Powers Knee-Operated Safety Mixer is designed to mix hot water and deliver a safe supply of warm water for surgeons and dental wash-up sinks. The two safety features, a pressure equalizing valve and a safety stop, described on pages 2 and 3, are included in its construction. The mixer will maintain desired temperature regardless of pressure changes in supply lines. Mixer should be installed with a loose key stop valve in its cold water supply line and a combined volume and stop valve in its hot water supply line. The force of the delivery flow may be regulated by this combined volume and stop valve.\n\nMixer is furnished in chromium plated finish with machined surfaces polished. The bronze wall mounting brackets are optional and may be had in white plated or chromium plated finish.\n\nList Prices\u2014See Items 6 to 8 in price list on page 4.\nPowers Style D Steam and Water Mixer\n\nThe Powers Style D Steam and Water Mixer is recommended for use where it is not practical to install a steam heated water storage tank and regulator. It will deliver hot water at approximately 150\u00b0F, water at a reasonably constant temperature for showers; wash sinks and wash fountains; dishwashing machines; barrel, can and car washes; and industrial processes.\n\nThe \u00bd-inch mixer is intended to furnish tempered water for only one shower or fixture. No shut-off valve or volume adjustment should be installed between the mixer and the shower head or outlet. When used in this manner, the steam and water pressures may be anything between 10 and 100 pounds.\n\nThe \u00be-inch mixer may also be used for furnishing tempered water to washup sinks provided there is a cold water connection at the fixture. By mixing cold water with the tempered water from the mixer, which is in this manner, the handle of the mixer is set at the desired temperature, and permanently in this position. For this type of installation the steam pressure should not exceed the cold water pressure; if it does, a reducing steam and water pressure reducing valve (see Bulletin No. 256) should be installed on the steam supply line to reduce the steam pressure and maintain it at the normal water pressure.\n\nThe 1-inch and 1\u00bd-inch mixers are intended for industrial process work and should generally be operated at least at 50% of their rated capacity.\n\nThe Style D mixer will not operate satisfactorily if either the steam or water pressure is less than 10 pounds or more than 100 pounds.\n\nSafety Features\u2014The two safety features described on pages 2 and 3 are incorporated in the design and a safety stop is included in the construction of this mixer. The mixer will maintain whatever temperature is desired regardless of pressure changes in the supply line. Failure of cold water substantially shuts off the delivery.\n\nConstruction\u2014The mixer is ruggedly built of bronze with all internal working parts chromium plated to resist corrosion. Dial face handles are heavily chromium plated. Handles providing safety stops. Wall flange can be supplied for mounting mixer to wall.\n\nConnections\u2014Inlets have standard male elbow connections with union. Outlet has female connection without union; male connection with union at outlet can be furnished when specified.\n\nTemperature Range\u2014Mixer can be adjusted to maintain any desired temperature between that of the incoming water and 200\u00b0F. Delivery volume decreases proportionately as temperature rises.\n\nCheck Valves\u2014The mixer has built-in check valves to prevent steam and cold water from interchanging. However, as an extra precaution, it is recommended that check valves be installed in both steam and water supply lines.\n\nShut-Off Valve\u2014The mixer has a built-in shut-off valve.\n\nStrainers\u2014To protect shower mixers and heads from dirt and scale, self-cleaning strainers (page 35) should be installed in steam and cold water supply lines or mains. We can also furnish chromium plated brass strainer tees (see roughing-in dimensions and price list).\n\nCAPACITIES\n\n(Based on delivery temperature of 100\u00b0F.)\n\n| Size, Inches | Minimum steam or water pressure, pounds | 10 | 25 | 45 | 60 |\n|-------------|----------------------------------------|----|----|----|----|\n| \u00bd-inch mixer, gallons per minute | 215 | 5 | 7 | 8 |\n| \u00be-inch mixer, gallons per minute | 5 | 9\u00bd | 14 | 16\u00bd |\n| 1-inch mixer, gallons per minute | 7 | 13\u00bd | 22 | |\n\n(Based on steam and water at 15 pounds pressure and water at 60\u00b0F.)\n\n| Delivery temperature | 100\u00b0F | 120\u00b0F | 140\u00b0F | 160\u00b0F | 180\u00b0F | 200\u00b0F |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| \u00bd-inch mixer, gals. per min. | 6\u00bd | 5 | 3\u00bd | 3 | 2\u00bd | 2 |\n| \u00be-inch mixer, gals. per min. | 14 | 11\u00bd | 9\u00bd | 8 | 6\u00bd | 5 |\n| 1-inch mixer, gals. per min. | 19 | 16 | 13\u00bd | 11 | 9\u00bd | 8 |\n\nNOTE: Increase steam with increase in temp. at 140\u00b0F.

Both sizes are made in two styles: M-E for exposed piping, and M-C for concealed piping.\n\nThe mixer controls thermostatically the mixed water temperature. It may be used to deliver tempered water for showers, bathtubs, hydrotherapeutic baths, wash-up tanks, photographic developing and printing tanks, industrial processes, etc.\n\nSee Fig. 39-149. The temperature of the mixed water remains constant regardless of temperature or pressure changes in the supply lines, and failure of either supply shuts off the delivery flow.\n\nRestricting the delivery of an M-E-6 or M-C-6 mixer to a minimum flow of one gallon per minute is possible without a noticeable change in the delivery temperature.\n\nTemperature Range\u2014The standard mixer will deliver tempered water at any desired point between cold water and 115\u00b0 F. It can be furnished for a higher operating temperature (maximum 140\u00b0) when ordered.\n\nConstruction\u2014The thermostat is of the bimetallic type consisting of rust-proof materials, and has a reserve of power many times that required for normal operation. It is very rugged, yet extremely sensitive, and because of its unusual size and heavy construction, it is recommended to be installed near the supply lines. Upon removal of the cover plate the three units comprising the mixer working parts are easily accessible for inspection or cleaning.\n\nThe mixing motor is equipped with stainless steel mixing valves. The valve housing and its seats are heavily chromium plated to resist wear and corrosion. The mixer can be furnished in rough bronze or polished chromium plated finish.\n\nThe standard mixer is designed for upward delivery with the outlet at the top. Bottom outlet for downward delivery, or both top and bottom outlets, can be supplied if specified. Inlet and outlet are tapped with \u00bd-inch pipe thread, but mixers with \u00be-inch inlets or outlets can be furnished if specified.\n\nCheck Valves\u2014The M-E-6 and M-C-6 mixers have built-in check valves which are easily accessible for inspection, cleaning or replacement. The M-E-10 and M-C-10 mixers do not have built-in check valves.\n\nVolume Control Shut-Off Valve\u2014These mixers do not have a built-in shut-off valve. To shut off, restrict or vary the delivery from the mixer, a separate volume control shut-off valve is required (see page 12, and price list on page 11).\n\nStrainers\u2014These mixers have coarse mesh built-in strainers. For additional protection for the mixer and shower head separate strainers of fine mesh and larger screen area are recommended. For exposed installation and to match the mixer, Powers Union Screen (page 11) or Union Check Valve Strainer Trees can be furnished (see page 11 and price list on page 11). As an alternative, the self-cleaning strainers may be installed in hot and cold water lines or mains.\n\nUnion Street Elbows can be furnished for the style M-E-6 and M-E-10 mixers (see page 14 and price list on page 11).\n\nSpecial Features\u2014Which can be furnished without extra charge are thermostat dial and handle for the M-C mixer (page 12); Installation handle (page 14); removable temperature adjustment key (page 14). Prices for special finishes on request.\n\nCAPACITIES\n\n(Based on delivery temperature of 100\u00b0 F.)\n\n| Minimum hot or cold water pressure, lbs. | 10 | 25 | 45 | 60 |\n|----------------------------------------|----|----|----|----|\n| M-E-6 and M-C-6, gallons per minute     | 3  | 4  | 6  | 7  |\n| M-E-10 and M-C-10, gallons per minute   | 4  | 7  | 10 | 11 |\n\nNote: For complete capacities see page 8.\n\nHow to Order\u2014State purpose and use and specify:\n\n(A) Style of mixer; M-E-6 or M-E-10 for exposed piping, M-C-6 or M-C-10 for concealed piping, knee-operated, or elbow operated.\n\n(B) Finish\u2014Rough bronze or chromium plated.\n\n(C) \u00bd-inch inlet or \u00be-inch inlet.\n\n(D) \u00bd-inch (standard) or \u00be-inch outlet.\n\n(E) Top (standard) or bottom outlet, or both.\n\n(F) Is a volume control shut-off valve to be included?\n\n(G) Any special features required?\n\n(I) Normal and maximum temperatures required.\n\n(J) Temperature and pressure of hot water supply.\n\n(K) Temperature and pressure of cold water supply.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, a chromium plated mixer with maximum delivery temperature of 115\u00b0 F. and with \u00bd-inch inlets and \u00be-inch top outlet but less volume control shut-off valve will be furnished.\n\nSimple Construction\n\nNote the simple, rugged construction and the small number of parts. The large bimetallic thermostat motor insures a reserve of power many times that required for normal operation. The valve assembly housing contains the stainless steel mixing valves, strainers and check valves, and may be lifted out as a unit by removal of the two valve housing screws. Due to the construction used, the mixer may be permanently installed, either exposed or concealed, as all parts may be easily removed for inspection, cleaning or repair.\nRoughing-In Dimensions\n\nStyle M-E-6 and M-E-10 for Exposed Piping\n\nFurnished standard with \u00bd-inch inlet and \u00bd-inch control outlet, or both top and bottom outlets, furnished knee-operated.

The delivery temperature remains constant regardless of pressure or temperature fluctuations in the supply lines.\n\nList Prices\u2014See Items 13 and 14 in price list on page 16.\n\n---\n\n**Powers Thermostatic Water Controllers Exposed Type**\n\nThis controller is designed for exposed installation, to control thermostatically the mixing of hot and cold water and to deliver a mixture at any temperature desired within the range of the controller. Controllers for concealed installation are shown on page 22.\n\nBecause of its rugged construction and dependable operation, this controller is used widely on group or gang shower baths, progressive or zone showers, hospital hydrotherapy, wash sinks and wash fountains, automobile and truck washing, industrial processes, etc.\n\nSafe Features\u2014The temperature of the water delivered by this controller will not vary with changes of temperature in the hot water supplied to the controller. Neither will reasonable changes of pressure affect it. (If pressure changes are extreme, a pressure equalizer is recommended; see paragraph headed Water Pressure for details.)\n\nIn case of a failure of either the hot or cold water supply, the controller will shut off the delivery, a dry shut-off on the hot side being assured by the use of a composition disc.\n\nTemperature Range and Adjustment\u2014Standard range is from cold water temperature to 115\u00b0 F., but for hot water line control a range of 100\u00b0 to 140\u00b0 F. can be supplied.\n\nControllers C-20, C-30 and C-40 have lever adjustment, but knurled wheel adjustment will be substituted if desired; Controllers C-60, C-100 and C-125 have wheel adjustment. Removable key adjustment lock can be supplied at extra cost for any size controller.\nConstruction\u2014Controllers C-20, C-30 and C-40 are made of bronze with polished chromium plated finish. C-60, C-100 and C-125 are made of bronze, stainless steel plated, but polished only on machining parts. Controllers can also be furnished in rough bronze. Controller C-125 can be had in iron body construction with bronze inner parts and aluminum paint finish.\n\nCheck Valves and Strainers\u2014All controllers have hot and cold water check valves and strainer tees with removable filter screens of very large capacity.\n\nPiping Connections\u2014Controllers are built standard for upward discharge, but will be furnished for downward discharge when so specified.\n\nStrainer tees are arranged for supply lines coming up from the floor, but may very easily be rotated to accommodate piping coming from above or from the wall.\n\nWall Support can be furnished when specified (see Item 10 in price list below, and roughing-in dimensions on page 21).\n\nWater Pressure\u2014Hot and cold water should always come from the same original source or at least be under approximately the same pressure. For best results this pressure should not be over 60 pounds and never over 100 pounds. Pressure reducing valves should be used if necessary (see Bulletin No. 256).\n\nIf cold water supply pressure fluctuates more than 50% above or below hot water supply pressure, Controllers C-20, C-30 and C-40 should be ordered equipped with a built-in equalizer (see Item 11 in price list). As Controllers C-60, C-100 and C-125 are not made with built-in equalizers, a Powers special composition diaphragm pressure equalizer should be used (see page 21, and Item 12 in price list below). Powers pressure equalizers are also available for use with standard Controllers C-20, C-30 and C-40; information and prices upon application.\n\nPressure equalizers for controllers C-60, C-100 and C-125 are furnished in rough bronze finish only. They have a removable single seat valve, an iron housing, and a special composition equalizing diaphragm. Equalizers should be installed in a horizontal position and may be placed alongside, in back of, or directly over or under the controller, behind the wall, or a reasonable distance from the controller.\n\nCapacities shown in the table below are based on 45 pounds hot and cold water pressure and 100\u00b0 delivery temperature. Complete capacity data will be found on page 36.\n\nHow to Order\u2014State proposed use and specify:\n\n(A) Controller size.\n(B) Exposed or concealed type controller. If concealed, specify horizontal or vertical mounting, and thickness of panel or table top (maximum two inches).\n(C) Finish: Rough bronze, chromium plated, or iron body (C-125 only).\n(D) Upward (standard) or downward discharge.\n(E) Any special features required.\n(F) Maximum temperature required.\n(G) Minimum and maximum delivery volume.\n(H) Pressures of hot and cold water.\n(I) Temperature of hot water.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, an exposed type, chromium plated controller with upward discharge and set for a maximum delivery temperature of 115\u00b0 F. will be furnished.\n\n### LIST PRICES, Capacities, and Shipping Weights\n\n| Item | Controller Identification | Capacities (Gals.

It is particularly recommended for hot water line control, for use on submerged or indirect type heaters, cooling water systems for Diesel and gaso- line engines, etc. The Powers No. 9 regulator is a standard reg- ulator and is not recommended for use as a mixing valve to deliver tempered water direct to shower heads.\n\nConstruction\u2014This regulator is of all metal con- struction with approved brass finish. It is simple in design and easy to install, requiring no compressed air, water or electricity for operation. The hot water inlet is at the top of the regulator, the water inlet at one side, and the outlet for the mixed water at the opposite side. The three-way valve is of the screwed type, and has a special bush well built into the outlet side. The operat- ing lever, which operates both the main bellows diaphragm and adjustment feature, may be operated from the line. The regulator is furnished complete for upright installation but will be furnished inverted if specified.\n\nTemperature Range and Adjustment\u2014The reg- ulator is furnished standard to operate at 140\u00b0F. with a range of approximately 10\u00b0 above and below this point. When specified, it can be furnished for any other 20\u00b0 range between 100\u00b0 and 160\u00b0F.\n\nWater Pressure\u2014Hot and cold water pressures must be approximately equal. If one pressure is considerably higher than the other, a suitable reducing valve must be used (see Bulletin No. 256). Check valves should always be installed in both hot and cold water supply lines.\n\nHow to Order\u2014State proposed use and specify valve size, operating range, range of adjustment, pres- sures of hot and cold water, and temperature of hot water.\n\nLIST PRICES, Capacities, Shipping Weights and Principal Dimensions\n\n| Item | Valve Size, inches | 1 | 1 1/4 | 1 1/2 | 2 | 2 1/2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n|------|------------------|---|-------|-------|---|-------|---|---|---|\n| 1    | List Price       | $112.50 | $178.25 | $209.75 | $261.35 | $323.00 | $356.75 | $387.50 | $429.00 | $460.50 |\n| 2    | Capacity, G.P.M. at 5 lbs. | 15 | 25 | 35 | 50 | 60 | 80 | 100 | 140 | 200 |\n| 3    | Capacity, G.P.M. at 20 lbs. | 30 | 55 | 90 | 125 | 150 | 200 | 250 | 350 | 500 |\n| 4    | Capacity, G.P.M. at 50 lbs. | 45 | 80 | 135 | 180 | 225 | 300 | 375 | 525 | 750 |\n| 5    | Shipping Weight, pounds | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 80 | 100 | 125 | 150 |\n| 6    | Dimension A, inches | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 |\n| 7    | Dimension B, inches | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 |\n| 8    | Dimension C, inches | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 |\n| 9    | Dimension D, inches | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 |\n| 10   | Dimension E, inches | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 |\n| 11   | Dimension F, inches | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 |\n| 12   | Dimension G, inches | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 |\n| 13   | Dimension H, inches | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 |\n| 14   | Dimension I, inches | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 |\n| 15   | Dimension J, inches | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 |\n| 16   | Dimension K, inches | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 40 | 50 | 60 | 70 |\n\nTo prolong the life of the three-way valve and insure accurate control, install self-cleaning strainers in both supply lines. See page 35.\n\nPowers No. 10 Regulator with Three-Way Valve\n\nThis unit is designed to mix hot and cold water in large volume and deliver the mixture at a pre-set tem- perature. It is used in paper mills, tanneries, and other industries that require large quantities of tempered water. It may also be piped to divert the flow of a liquid. It is equipped with a 1-inch reducing valve to deliver tempered water direct to shower heads.\n\nEither compressed air or water, at 15 pounds pressure, must be used for the operation of this regulator, which is furnished with a 1-inch reducing valve to reduce initial pressure of not more than 65 pounds to 15 pounds. If compressed air is available it should be used in preference to water.\n\nConstruction\u2014The three-way valves have bronze bodies, cast in sizes up to Schedule inclusive, and iron bodies, screwed cast, bronze valve seats in sizes 2\u00bd-inch and larger. The bronze valve disc is of special skirted design to prevent \"burning.\" Iron body valves are fitted with bronze flanges at extra cost, as so specified. Companion flanges and bolts are not included but can be furnished at market prices when ordered.\n\nThe regulator is furnished complete if desired. It is connected to the valve top by \u00bd-inch pipe. A supply pressure gauge and control pressure gauge are included. The supply valve is equipped with a filter. A relief valve and a check valve are located in the line between the regulator and diaphragm top.\n\nTemperature Range and Adjustment\u2014Unit can be set to maintain any desired temperature within its 10\u00b0 range of operation.

It is not intended for controlling valve to deliver tempered water directly to shower heads.\n\n**Construction**\u2014Valve sizes \u00bc-inch and \u00bd-inch have bronze bodies with union connections; sizes \u00be-inch to 2-inch, inclusive, have lead bodies; sizes 2\u00bd-inch to 4-inch have iron bodies, screwed, but can be furnished flanged with standard drilling at extra cost. Sizes 5-inch and larger have cast iron bodies, patented design to prevent \"hunting.\" Thermostatic bulb is copper, with pipe-threaded stem and union nut. Flexible tubing is copper with braided protective sheathing; standard lengths are shown in price list.\n\n**Temperature Range and Adjustment**\u2014Regulator is furnished standard to operate at 140\u00b0 F., with a range of adjustment automatically set thereafter; any other 40\u00b0 range between 60\u00b0 and 250\u00b0 F. may be had. Regulator can be furnished at extra cost for operation between 40\u00b0 and 60\u00b0. Special ranges outside of standard, but dial adjustment can be furnished at extra cost for valve sizes \u00bc-inch to \u00be-inch, inclusive.\n\n**Water Pressure**\u2014Hot and cold water pressures must approximately equalize; if they do not, a suitable reducing valve should be used (see Bulletin No. 256). Check valve should always be fitted in both hot and cold water supply lines.\n\n**How to Order**\u2014State properly the size and special valve size, operating temperature, range of adjustment; temperature bulb pressure of hot and cold water; and whether bulb is to be mounted horizontally, vertically pointing upward, or vertically pointing downward. If valve is to be piped for diverting, give full details as to its use.\n\n---\n\n**Other Powers Regulators for Mixing Hot and Cold Water**\n\nIllustrated below are more of the many different types of controls we make. No other firm manufactures such a complete line of devices to regulate the mixing of hot and cold water.\n\nWhenever special problems of temperature regulation arise, let our engineering department study your requirements and recommend the type of control that will give you the best results.\n\nAll of the illustrations below show direct acting regulators. In these installations, should the air supply to the regulator fail the valve springs will move the disc so that the cold water supply is shut off and only hot water allowed to pass through the mixing valve.\n\nIf it is preferred to stop the flow of hot water should the air supply fail, allowing only cold water to flow, a reverse acting regulator must be used, in which case the cold water must enter at the bottom of the valve and the hot water at the side.\n\n---\n\n**LIST OF PARTS, Capacities, Shipping Weights and Principal Dimensions**\n\n| Item | Valve Size, inches | \u00bc | \u00bd | \u00be | 1 | 1\u00bd | 2 | 2\u00bd | 3 | 4 |\n|------|-------------------|---|---|---|---|----|---|----|---|---|\n| 1    | Temperature between 60\u00b0 and 250\u00b0 F. | 878 | 978 | 1078 | 1178 | 1278 | 1378 | 1478 | 1578 | 1678 |\n| 2    | Temperature between 60\u00b0 and 250\u00b0 F.* | 878 | 978 | 1078 | 1178 | 1278 | 1378 | 1478 | 1578 | 1678 |\n| 3    | Capacity, G.

J. Davidson, Departmental Purchasing Agent\n\nGentlemen: Re: File 46.411-15-2 R.C.\n\nAs outlined in our conversation when we visited Ottawa, we now have available a 2\u00bd\" #11 regulator which we can supply to be used for the purpose required. We are assuming that this is low pressure steam, that is up to 50# gauge pressure and are quoting on a bronze trimmed valve accordingly.\n\nWe understand that this regulator is to control the steam on a converter which heats the hot water storage tank, and that the tank supplies water directly to shower heads. Since there is a great risk here that the deposit of scale might become lodged beneath the seat of the valve, which would result in over heating of the tank, or that the capillary system of the regulator might fail, we would recommend the installation of a thermostatic water controller to mix hot water from the tank with cold water, giving tempered water at a maximum of 115\u00b0F. Since the thermostatic water controller will give a direct shut-off on failure of cold supply, this is a positive protection against scalding.\n\nWhile the regulator is necessary and desirable, it is not, in any sense, a safety control, and as there have been several severe accidents resulting from the use of a regulator alone, we wish to place ourselves on record as definitely recommending a thermostatic water controller. Our quotation is as follows:\n\n1 2\u00bd\" #11 regulator, double seated bronze trimmed valve, iron body with screwed connections, temperature range 140-180\u00b0F., with spring and collar adjustment with standard copper bulb and 8' of flexible tubing..........................$114.00\n\nSales Tax extra\n\nMore than 50 different types of Regulators to Control the Temperature of Liquids, Gas and Air\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\n\n1 C40 thermostatic water controller, chromium plated for exposed mounting, upward discharge maximum temperature 115\u00b0F., having 1\" inlets and 1\u00bd\" outlets with a delivery capacity of 53 U.S. gallons per minute at 45# water pressure. This capacity should be sufficient to serve from six to ten showers..................$187.25\n\nSales Tax included\n\nIf exemption is claimed, allowance 4%.\n\nThe above prices are net f.o.b. Toronto. Delivery period on the regulator approximately 2-3 weeks, and on the controller 10-12 weeks.\n\nWe wish to thank you for the opportunity of making this quotation, and trust we may have the pleasure of serving you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE CANADIAN POWERS REGULATOR CO., LIMITED\n\nper\n\nCJB/G\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, July 28th, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M.

A quotation was received on retubing this boiler in 1942 from Patterson Iron Works at a cost of $45.00, plus freight both ways, and it is not anticipated that the present cost of retubing will exceed this amount to any great extent. An amount of $50.00 was provided in the estimates for this purpose and it is recommended that authority be granted to have the boiler shipped to Vancouver and repaired. Please let me have a reply by air mail.\n\n-D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n6-11-4\n\nOttawa, July 17, 1945.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing a list of repairs which are considered necessary at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. The total amount of the repairs requested is $1,005.90.

As the Department had closed their teacherage at Takush Village, Smiths Inlet, and had transferred some household equipment to Alert Bay to be placed in storage, I utilized what furnishings I could to partially furnish the part used as a teacherage. Mrs. Massey, who was then principal of the Alert Bay Indian Day School, purchased additional furnishings to supplement what we already had.\n\nThis year, Mrs. Massey resigned and moved away and was going to sell her share of the furniture locally, which meant we would be back in the same predicament as we were before with no place for a teacher to live. In order to try and keep a permanent place for our teachers, I purchased the furniture owned by Mrs. Massey and paid her $72.00 for everything.\n\nI enclose you, herewith, voucher No. 136 in the amount of $72.00, together with a list of the furnishings purchased and the receipt from Mrs. Massey, and am recommending to the Department that they purchase these furnishings which will be used for a permanent furnished teacherage so long as we are able to have the use of the building. I might add that Mrs. Massey gave us a good price on all these furnishings and they are well worth the money.\n\n(Sgd) M.S.

Stanley Brock are required to forward by the Indian Residential School Commission of Winnipeg to forward to them all invoices for payment. It is possible that Stanley Brock failed to forward the invoice for this amount to the Indian Residential Commission at Winnipeg.\n\nThe item ordered, soap, to the value of $91.88 evidently was invoiced to Winnipeg since the firm makes no complaint of non-payment of this sum.\n\nI am writing to our Winnipeg office to ascertain whether they have paid this freight bill.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) S.

Wickens, Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, called here yesterday regarding the matter of the supply of a station wagon for use at the school, explaining that the need was more necessary now than ever owing to the transportation needs of the children admitted to the Preventorium for treatment. It will be noted that provision was made in the current year's Estimates of the Kwawkwekwth Agency for the supply of a station wagon to the Residential school.\n\nIn view of the information given by the Principal regarding the use of such a vehicle for Preventorium cases it is thought that at least part of the cost involved might be met by the Department of National Health and Welfare and I should like to suggest that they be approached in connection with the matter.\n\nThe need exists for this type of vehicle in connection with the operation of the school and Preventorium and I would recommend that the necessary funds be provided for the purpose.\n\nD.

The question of employing suitable labour has been difficult during recent years.\n\nOn August 8th Mr. Wickens came to me and suggested that the Department supply a time-clock for use of the Night Watchman in order to have a greater check on his movements. Mr. Wickens felt this would insure greater supervision, and in this I concur.\n\nI enclose you, herewith, copy of letter which I have today received from Mr. Wickens, in which he is requesting that a time-clock and equipment be purchased. As I consider this is very necessary in the interests of security to life and property in this school, I am recommending that same be provided at an early date.\n\nAs we have no means here of obtaining prices, it would be appreciated if same could be secured in Vancouver and submitted to Ottawa if you concur in my recommendation.\n\n(M.

Supt., Indian Health Services.\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd,\n\nI regret that my absence from Alert Bay has delayed my letter of Annual Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nI am not repeating the items requisitioned in past years although they are still needed. The water-proofing of the whole school and the new floor to the Auditorium were the main items in last year's requisition.\n\nBeing away from the office I have no present access to my files to ascertain the lesser items in my listed needs of former years.\n\nThe requests I am now making are listed as under:\n\n(1) The razing of the old School Block is very necessary. The recent earthquake did some damage to the building which was already insecure. The two rooms being used as classrooms let in the rain very badly, windows and plaster needing attention. I recommend the erection of a new building large enough to provide two full sized classrooms and two storerooms - approximately 60' x 60' at a cost of $7,000.00.\n\n(2) I recommend the building of a Farm Instructors Cottage. This will provide for better oversight of our herd and livestock and also release much needed space in the main school block for the accommodation of our staff. Cost $3,000.00.\n\n(3) The time has come when some of the mattresses for our Dormitory beds should be renewed. I request that fifty (50) new mattresses be purchased - approximate cost $400.00.\n\n(4) Our farm machinery needs attention and I request that a new Farm wagon be purchased at an approximate price of $200.00. Two new wheels have been purchased for the present wagon during the past year and the frame cannot be expected to last much longer.\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay.\n\n(5) With the increasing difficulty of buying cord wood and the high cost of purchasing coal, I request that consideration be given to the installation of an oil fuel system for the school heating plant - approximate cost $600.00 for the two boilers.\n\nI trust the Department may see its way clear to the authorization of these projects, and beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nS.

Driving rain leaks through the walls and collects on the basement floor. Moisture in the walls is also causing the plaster to fall off.

(RG 10, Volume 6428, file 875-5, part 9)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAttention Mr. R.A. Hoey, Director.\n\nIn a recent press release, your remarks re a proposed or suggested new set up for educational residential schools were noted with interest.\n\nOn his last visit to Prince Rupert en route to Babine Agency, a similar proposal was discussed with District Inspector Davey, with particular reference to the Crosby Home at Port Simpson. Whilst no longer within my jurisdiction I also placed before him a plan which I believed would work admirably at Alert Bay, at which point there is a large residential school under Anglican auspices, as well as a potential 4 room day school set-up.\n\nAt the residential school there is an old \"classroom block\", formerly a girls boarding school. This building is a fire trap and should be replaced.\n\nThe residential school building proper has 3 classrooms. There is a serious shortage of playrooms in this building, the children using the basements for such purposes. Most of the winter months are such as to keep the children indoors a large part of the time.\n\nAdjacent to the residential school is a special reserve, now subdivided; the original purpose of which was to provide land for the housing of ex-pupils. There has been a serious overcrowding of the village day school for many years as Indians from outside villages (too small to support day schools) have moved in to get their children to school.\n\nMy suggestion to Inspector Davey was (a) to build a ten or twelve room consolidated school on the special reserve adjacent to the residential school, capable of handling the 200 pupils from St. Michaels, plus the 100 pupils of the day school in the village. Two of the rooms would be for high school pupils who would be drawn from (a) the Kwakweweth Agency and (b) from other agencies in which there are no available \"high\" high schools, e.g., the Bella Coola Agency. The residential school could become a hostel or home for (a) orphans, neglected and problem cases, (b) these high school pupils (c) preventorium children as at present. The present classroom block would be demolished and so remove the biggest fire risk to the main building.\n\nThe proposed educational centre would be built and operated entirely by the Department with a full Civil Service staff. It would include an industrial arts and domestic science division, and built in the form of a wheel with six spokes. The hub would be a teacher's residence containing apartments and single rooms; the six spokes the classrooms, manual and industrial arts and domestic science; and an auditorium gymnasium. It would be steam heated from the central building. If the teachers quarters were not to be included, the central block could be the gymnasium-auditorium, with shops and domestic science rooms above or below.\nAlert Bay would be an ideal place in which to establish such an educational unit, which would of course be also used in a major adult education programme and presupposes the use of a school-village health nurse, welfare teacher in addition to the academic staff. It should be remembered that the Department is going to have to build (a) a day school of at least 4 rooms for the village in any case (b) a new classroom unit at the Residential School should the status quo remain constant. My suggestion to Mr. Davey was to combine the two needs, take care of the High School pupils of a very large part of the B.C. coast; put the academic side of education solely on the Department and I believe, if the right man can be secured to head it up, do a real piece of work for the Indians at not much greater cost than at present. Pupils of all faiths would be admitted to the proposed educational unit.\n\nThis has been much on my mind in the past few years and your statement to the Indian Committee gives me encouragement to put my idea into writing. I know that Alert Bay is no longer my territory but my roots are down deep in that spot and I do not easily forget the many years I worked there.\n\nIf this scheme has any merit and is investigated further, I would ask that my name be kept out of it as far as the Indian Agent, Alert Bay is concerned, as he may not take kindly to a scheme coming from another Agent.\n\nI may be in Ottawa on leave in September and would like the opportunity of discussing this further and also a proposed Indian co-operative fishing scheme, details of which I am now bringing together into a definite plan.\n\nF.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn official letter of September 18th, 1946, you were authorized to purchase a time clock for the night watchman at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nThe attached account has just been received from Indian Agent Todd.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 14th instant\nwith reference to the request for the Department\nto supply a moving picture machine for the Alert\nBay Indian Residential School.\n\nI realize the value of having such equip-\nment in a residential school, but no funds have\nyet been provided for this particular purpose in\nour appropriation and, consequently, favourable\nconsideration cannot be given to the request from\nthe Alert Bay school.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nAIRMAL:\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Todd's letter of June 23rd and enclosure referred to therein in connection with the proposed supply of a moving picture machine for the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nA memorandum dated July 11th, from the District School Inspector is enclosed, wherein he expresses the opinion that every residential school should have a movie projector, and that limited use of such a machine might be secured for the Day School pupils, but recommends against purchase of this equipment by the Department for the reason that other Residential Schools have used their own funds for this purpose. Aside from this however, the amount provided in the current appropriation for the Alert Bay Residential School will not meet their more urgent requirements in the way of repairs and new equipment, in view of which there could be no object in considering the purchase of a projector at the present time.\n\nD.

S.J. Wickens, Principal of St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, and will be self-explanatory.\n\nNo doubt Inspector Davey is familiar with the kind and type of machine necessary for the School. This matter is being left for his decision.\n\nIf the Department can find their way clear to purchase this machine, I know it will be of value not only to the Residential School but to the Day School as well and I would, therefore, recommend that it be purchased if money is available.\n\n\"M.S. Todd\"\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent.\nMemorandum\n\nTo: The Indian Commissioner  \nFrom: The School Inspector\n\nI refer to the request of the Rev. S.J. Wickens for the purchase of a moving picture machine by the Department for the St. Michael's School at Alert Bay.\n\nEvery Residential School should have a movie projector and in this case a limited use might be made of it by the Day School. However the majority of Residential Schools in B.C., have purchased this equipment from their own funds and I do not consider the value of this machine to the Day School warrants the expenditure of $500 by the Department.\n\nI cannot recommend the purchase of this machine by the Department.\n\nR.F.

Approximate cost - $1,500.00\n\nMAJOR REPAIRS AND ALTERATIONS REQUIRED\n\nImproved Wash Room facilities for the Lower School Boys have been asked for and recommended by the Medical Officer for Indian Affairs. Approximate cost - $300.00\n\nWaterproofing of the Main School Building has been requested for years. Approximate cost at present prices - $4,000.00\n\nChanging over Boiler Room to an oil fuel system is necessary in the interest of labour saving and efficiency. Approximate cost - $500.00\n\nNew Floor in the Auditorium is required. Approximate cost - $250.00\n\nThe above major repair items are in the order of importance given by the Principal, who states that he has discussed them with your Agent.\nOttawa, October 10, 1947.\n\nMr. M.

It is possible that the amount mentioned may not be sufficient and perhaps the work should be delayed until next year.

Original on 315-6-3 re Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nThe building has not received repairs which were long overdue on my last visit.\n\nBrick walls have not been waterproofed, resulting in flooded play rooms in rainy weather.\n\nThe recreation room on the girl's side is already inadequate in capacity for accommodation of nearly one hundred girls. Flooded or wet floors add still another menace to that of overcrowding. Waterproofing of walls should no longer be delayed.\n\nPanic bolts for fire escape doors are on hand but have not been installed. Fire escape doors are still locked awaiting installation of a buzzer system of alarm to indicate when doors are being opened.\n\nIt is recommended that the above alterations be expedited in the interest of safety should a fire break out.\n\nA worn out wooden floor in the boys' play room requires replacement and also an unsanitary wash bench in the same room. Plans for these alterations are under way.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am forwarding herewith Mr. Indian Agent Todd's letter of July 9th with regard to sewer pipe required for repairs at the Alert Bay Residential School.\n\nAs the repairs were considered to be of an emergent nature this office requested the Chief Engineer of the Surveys and Engineering Branch to secure the necessary material.\n\nIn this connection I am forwarding herewith Kwawkewlth Agency Voucher No. 432, in the amount of $48.50 in favor of the Active Trading Co.Ltd., of Vancouver, B.C., and would recommend that same be passed for payment.\n\nD.

Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nFarmers Cottage, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nYou may recollect that on the occasion of my introduction to you by Mr. Forward, the impossibility of securing a contractor to do certain waterproofing at our Alert Bay School was discussed and the question was raised of using the $2,000.00 provided in this year's Estimates for the reconstruction of the Farmer's Cottage. You suggested that the Principal consult your Agent there and submit bills of materials and estimates of labour required to complete this Cottage.\n\nSubsequently, the Principal was instructed on the above lines and we now have received his reply dated 9th October. In this reply he states that this Cottage has been completed, the work being done mainly by the School Staff and the materials and fixtures purchased chiefly from funds provided by this Administration for minor repairs.\n\nIn these circumstances, will you be willing to reimburse us for the materials and fixtures used in this reconstruction and apply the balance of the $2,000 towards one or more of the items which we have requested for inclusion in your Estimates for 1948-49? Among these items are:\n\n- Improvement of Wash Room facilities for the Lower School Boys $300.00\n- Changing over Boiler Room to an oil fuel system $500.00\n- Providing new floor in the Auditorium $250.00\nI understand that the Principal has taken up these matters with your Agent in that locality.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent\nOttawa, October 23, 1947.\n\nDear General Turner:\n\nWe have your letter of the 20th instant with reference to the farmer's cottage at the Alert Bay Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that the principal proceeded with the erection of this building without following the usual procedure.\n\nHowever, I suggest that you arrange to have the accounts covering the expenditure incurred submitted to Indian Agent Todd and he should be requested to forward same to Indian Commissioner MacKay. We are advising Major MacKay in the matter and we will endeavour to make refund to you.\n\nWhen we receive the accounts in connection with the cottage we will be in a position to decide what additional amount if any, can be provided from the current year's appropriation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation we provided an amount for water-proofing the exterior walls of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. Surveys and Engineering Branch found it impossible to proceed with this work during the past summer.\n\nThe officers of the M.S.C.C., whose head office is now located in Ottawa, approached us and pointed out the necessity for providing a cottage for the farmer at the school and asked us if we would expend the amount provided for water-proofing the walls for erecting this cottage.\n\nWe advised them to have the principal consult the Agent and submit requisitions for materials and estimates of labour.\n\nWe are now informed by the M.S.C.C. that the principal completed the work without following Departmental procedure. Evidently the labour was done by the school staff but certain expenditures were incurred for materials, etc.\n\nWe are instructing the M.S.C.C. to have the accounts incurred in connection with the construction of the farmer's cottage submitted to Indian Agent Todd and he in turn should submit them to you. When you receive these accounts you should forward same to this office stating if you consider the expenditures are reasonable and if so, you can certify the accounts and issue purchase orders for the materials that have been secured.\n\nBernard F.

Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe your 6-11-4 of December 2nd, 1947, dealing with Principal's quarters at Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nWhen the new school was built in 1929 I asked the Department to furnish the Principal's residence. Mr. W.E. Ditchburn, the Commissioner declined, but consented to furnish one bedroom only, which was done. The furniture of this room was carefully checked and left when we departed from Alert Bay, but I understand that Mr. A.W. Derrom, Vice-Principal, who took over for me until Mr. Wickens arrived, took this furniture to his suite in the main school. He had recently married one of the staff and I expect required the double bed. He has gone and I believe this furniture, bed, drawers and two chairs, is now used in the same room by a Mr. and Mrs. Wiseman farm instructor at the school.\n\nWhen we left Alert Bay, the Indian Residential School Commission bought our electric refrigerator which was moved to the Preventorium, our oil burning kitchen range and some other items of furniture, which I cannot remember at this time. I know that two bedrooms were left furnished. When I went to Alert Bay in 1926 I had to pay my predecessor $200.00 cash for furniture that I think had been in the school since 1889. It disintegrated and after I married we bought almost all new furniture of our own. If I remember correctly the total expenditure by the Department in the residence did not exceed $100.00 in furnishing the one bedroom.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nNovember 25th, 1947\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: St. Michael's Indian Residential School\n\nRev. Dixon arrived here and commenced duty at the school Nov. 24th, and apparently after having made a general inspection of the premises found that his living quarters were unfurnished. The matter had been previously taken up with his MSCC Headquarters, and he had a letter from them to the effect that it was the Department's responsibility to furnish these quarters.\n\nIt is our belief that furnishings were originally supplied, but have gradually disappeared throughout the years. At any rate, the former Principal had his own furniture, which he took away with him on his departure.\n\nThe new Principal has asked that if possible we obtain the following as soon as possible:\n\n1 Bedroom suite complete\n1 Chesterfield suite with two chairs\n1 Dining room suite\n\nIf it is found that we cannot make these purchases, we would ask that you direct the request through the necessary channels in order to get immediate action. In the meantime the Principal, Rev. Dixon, is getting along on makeshift arrangements.\n\nJ. C. Letcher\nActing Indian Agent.\nAir Mail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Acting Indian Agent Letcher's letter of November 25th wherein he requests that the Department provide furnishings for the principal's quarters at the Alert Bay Indian residential School. In the absence of any information on file with respect to furnishings previously supplied, if any, I contacted Mr. Anfield and secured the information as detailed in his letter attached. I have made inquiries regarding the cost of the furniture requested by the new principal in case the furnishings for his quarters are to be the Department's responsibility and find that the Bedroom suite, Chesterfield suite and Dining room suite will cost approximately $800.00.\n\nI should appreciate being advised if the Department ordinarily assumes responsibility for furnishing the principal's quarters at residential schools and if so if funds to the above amount can be made available.\n\nD.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI enclose for your information a letter recently received from Archdeacon Cook with reference to the Alert Bay Residential School. It is noted from this communication that the M.B.C.C. is prepared to be responsible for the labour required for painting and repairs, provided the annual vacation period be extended for three months.\n\nWe feel that any such extension of the holiday period would be inadvisable for many reasons and consequently we would like you to give us an estimate of what labour would cost to do the work that is absolutely essential. Previous to submitting this estimate you might communicate with the Reverend principal and ascertain what assistance in the form of labour the school staff is prepared to give during the months of July and August and if you have this information it would reduce the amount that the Department would be expected to pay.\n\nYou should also forward a requisition for the paint and materials for repairs that you recommend and let us know the approximate cost of these, and if they can be purchased in British Columbia you should submit the names and addresses of the firms from whom the paint and materials can be secured.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nEnc.\nMarch 9, 1948.\n\nDear Archdeacon Cook:\n\nWe have your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the Alert Bay Residential School. It is noted that in connection with the painting and repair work that you consider necessary at the Alert Bay School, you offer to supply labour if the Department supplies the material. We appreciate your co-operation in this regard but it appears that this would be contingent on increasing the holiday leave from two months to three months.\n\nFor many reasons we feel that it is undesirable to increase the holidays at any one school unless the situation is more serious than at Alert Bay.\n\nWe are writing to Indian Commissioner Arneil requesting him to let us have an estimate of the cost of the labour in carrying out the repairs and painting during the months of July and August. We are instructing him to communicate with the Reverend Principal of the Alert Bay school with a view to ascertaining how much labour can be supplied by the school staff and intimating to him that we will be prepared to pay the cost of the labour over and above what is supplied free by the staff. We are also requesting him to submit a requisition for the paint and materials required.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nVen. Archdeacon H.G.

Mr. Acting Indian Agent Letcher was requested to consult with the Principal and advise what items were required to bring this equipment up to standard. The Acting Agent's letter of February 5th and enclosure in this connection is attached hereto and I would recommend that the departmental purchasing be requested to secure 24 single beds complete with springs and mattresses and 24 additional mattresses. If the Department so desires prices can be secured in Vancouver but it is anticipated that the expenditure would exceed $500.00, the maximum amount which the Commissioner has authority to cover by purchase order.\n\nW.S.

Neary:\n\nThis is just a personal note to thank you for your kindness and help extended to me while I was in Ottawa recently. I arrived home and am on duty. My doctors informed me my recovery is almost complete but I must have proper rest and not try to overdo things.\n\nFor your information, Commissioner Arneil and Inspector Davey visited the Agency three days after my return, and we decided that the north half of Lot 23 (which has since been the subject of another report which will reach you shortly) is the proper location of the new proposed classroom block to accommodate Residential School pupils.\n\nI have also interviewed a local contractor who is building the Agency residence this year and he is willing to accept a contract for the labour only for this building, the Department to purchase all materials. This I think we can do without any difficulty, and as soon as you are prepared to go ahead, this advance notice will help you in deciding your plans. This same contractor would, I believe take a contract to supply material as well as do all the work, providing he was sure of being able to purchase all the material.\n\nYou will be pleased to know that we have drilled a new well and struck a supply of good water close to the new school site. The engineers are installing part of the plumbing which means both teacherages should be ready for occupancy shortly. All the plumbing is being put in with the exception of the toilets. This will have to be held up evidently until the sewerage system is installed.\n\nI am informed the Turnour Island School and Teacherage is about half completed. The Campbell River Teacherage is reported finished.\n\nThis personal note is just to say thanks for all your courtesy and assistance while I was in Ottawa, and to let you know what progress is being made in respect to our schools now under construction.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(M.S.

One merchant informed me he has received no remittance from the M.S.C.C. for four months. This information is becoming public property in this community and is casting a reflection on the Indian Affairs Branch. In respect to the Provincial Fund account, which I know has not been paid for four months, I should like to point out a voucher goes through each month covering their total grant, and I am sure the Department of National Health and Welfare pay this account each month as received; so there is no excuse whatsoever for this money not being passed on to the storekeeper when the Government have already paid it. It is felt this information should be known in Ottawa.\n\nDuring a recent conversation with the Rev. Dixon, Principal of St. Michael's Indian Residential School, he informed me that he had been instructed by Archdeacon Cook, M.S.C.C. Head Office, that he was to employ his staff for the coming term on the same salary basis as heretofore, which means they do not intend to comply with Provincial Department of Labour minimum wage regulations. If this policy is followed through there is no hope whatsoever of ever getting efficient staff in this school and the result will be the same inefficiency, and the administration of this institution deteriorating beyond where it is at the present time. It seems to me the time has come when the Department must take a serious view of the administration of this school.\n\nMr. Dixon informed me that his present engineer who was receiving a cash salary of $112.00 per month, plus living accommodation and other considerations, has resigned and the M.S.C.C. are transferring the engineer from the Chapleau Indian Residential School here and he is to be paid only $60.00 cash per month, plus the same considerations the previous engineer received. This is the policy of the M.S.C.C. They are not increasing salaries after receiving extra grant so that this could be done but are actually decreasing them in this case.\n\nIf the present policy is continued I can see no possible improvement in this school. The recent Departmental circular defined the responsibilities of the Church and the Department and has clarified certain aspects and is welcome.\n\nThe standard of some of the personnel employed in this school is very low. Recently one woman who was employed at the school left and went to work in a local hotel which is known for bootlegging all up and down the coast. This is not an isolated case but will give you some indication as to the type of help employed and the reason they have to employ this type is on account of low wages paid. It appears they take just whoever they can get with the result inefficiency is prevalent and supervision of children lacking. The Indian Affairs Branch, who are indirectly responsible for the care of these children, are being criticized but there seems nothing we can do under the present set-up.\nIndian Commissioner for B. C., Department of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 18th\nand June 8th last, file #6-11-3, and April 26th, file #6-11-4,\nrespectively. I have finally found time to go into the matter of\nrepairs to the Alert Bay Indian Residential School with the Principal,\nand wish to advise you as follows:\n\n(1) Mr. Dixon feels if the Department would approve of an\nexpenditure of $300.00 for labour to assist them in making necessary\nrepairs, they will be able to provide the additional labour themselves.\nI would, therefore, recommend that the Department approve of an expenditure\nof $300.00 for labour in respect to various repairs needed at the school.\n\n(2) Requisition is attached covering 300 lineal feet, 1 x 4,\n#1 and #2 clear, flat-grained Fir, $45. As this item will have to be\npurchased in Vancouver, I would request that you make the purchase\nlocally and have it shipped to the school at your earliest convenience,\nas it is for repairs to tables in the main dining-room.\n\n(3) Requisition is attached for paint, paint brushes, etc. for\npainting interior and exterior of the school.\n\n(4) Requisition is also attached for 200# plaster and 10 sq. ft.\nmetal lath. This material is to repair the inside walls which have been\ndamaged but will not be used until after the waterproofing of the main\nbuilding has been completed, as it would only be damaged.\n\n(5) Requisition is attached for sufficient lumber for a new\nfence in front of the school. This also will have to be purchased in\nVancouver so I would kindly ask you to obtain tenders, purchase same\nand ship it direct to the Principal. As you know the fence at the school\nis in a dilapidated condition. It is the original fence built at the\ntime the school was erected so it has done pretty good. I will supervise\nthe building of this fence and see that it is properly constructed.\nThis material should be dressed as we are going to paint it.\n\n(6) With reference to your letter of October 28th last, please\nbe advised the then principal did not submit a list of materials for\nuse in building the Farming Instructor's Cottage and had he done so\nI would have recommended against paying for same. The particulars in\nrespect to this work were dealt with by the Farming Instructor himself\nin his report on conditions at the school and neither he nor I would ask\nthe Department to spend one cent towards this undertaking. For your\ninformation the Farming Instructor has now resigned and left the school.\nMost of the material in any case was lumber purchased by the Department\nto be used for other specific purposes which were not carried out by the\nschool. As far as I am concerned the matter is concluded.\n\nIn perusing your letter of April 26th you state an amount of\n$4,000.00 has been included in the 1948-9 estimates for waterproofing\nthe main building and that this work will be carried out under the\nsupervision of the Lands and Development Services Branch.\n\np.t.c.\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. W.S.

Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nFurther to our conversation of last Friday afternoon concerning essential repairs to the Alert Bay Residential School:\n\nUnder date July 2nd, Principal Dixon was sent the following Night Letter -\n\n\"NOTIFY BY WIRE IF ANY REPAIRS BEING UNDERTAKEN BY INDIAN DEPARTMENT RELATIVE MY VISIT OF FEBRUARY LAST\".\n\nThis morning, the following Night Letter was received from Principal Dixon -\n\n\"NO REPAIRS UNDERTAKEN BY INDIAN DEPARTMENT AND NO PAINT OR OTHER MATERIAL RELATIVE TO YOUR VISIT RECEIVED INTEND TO SEE COMMISSIONER TOMORROW\".\n\nTo quote, also, from a letter under date June 26th and received this morning -\n\n\"At the time of writing we have not a pint of paint or any material on the place for all the renovating we were supposed to do. Not a thing has been supplied to the school through Mr. Todd since he returned from leave of absence. Anything we have received since I came here is the result of an order placed through Mr. Letcher, then Acting Agent.\"\n\nThe Administration went to considerable expense to do its share in trying to better conditions at the Alert Bay School but unless full co-operation is forthcoming from the Indian Affairs Agent in the field little actual progress can be made in\nbringing the Alert Bay School back to its former high standard.\n\nIn many of our schools and at Alert Bay, just one in particular, the Administration is receiving criticism for conditions which are definitely the responsibility of the Indian Affairs Branch. Then, too, because of the run-down condition and poor accommodation at some of the government-owned schools under our care, we have found it most difficult to retain the services of high type staff members. A considerable amount of the trouble experienced by this Administration in the operation of the Alert Bay School can be traced back to the indifference to his responsibilities of the Agent.\n\nAny help you can give in expediting these very necessary repairs to the above mentioned school will be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry J. Cook\nSuperintendent.\nJune 26, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 23rd instant, file 6-11-2, enclosing a letter from Indian Agent Todd with reference to the Alert Bay Residential School.\n\nSome years ago we reviewed the fire hazard situation at our residential schools and it was decided to allow a grant towards the salary of a night watchman at those residential schools at which we considered a definite fire hazard existed.\n\nThe Alert Bay Residential School was not considered to be in the class just mentioned and consequently we have never allowed a grant for a night watchman at that school. If we make an exception in the case of the Alert Bay School it will oblige us to take similar action at other residential schools in British Columbia and other parts of Canada.\n\nAs no funds have been provided for grants for additional night watchmen, we are unable to favourably consider allowing such grant at the Alert Bay School.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to Superintendent Todd's letter of June 15th and communication from the Principal, St. Michael's School attached, while I am inclined to agree with Mr. Todd's views to a certain extent in view of the financial situation at the Residential School and the fact that the Department makes a grant towards the salary of a night watchman at various residential schools in the Province I would recommend a grant of $40.00 a month to St. Michael's school for a period of six months during the winter season.\n\nW.

Dixon's letter referred to therein in connection with repairs required to the pump providing a water supply to the residential school. As a result of this correspondence and investigations made by the Lands and Development Services Branch a report dated May 31st by Mr. A. Unsworth was forwarded to the Chief Engineer, Ottawa on June 10th. Mr. Unsworth in his report recommends that the 7 H.P. Petter Atomic Diesel engine which operates the pump be shipped to the B.C. Equipment Company, Vancouver, for advice and estimate of a complete overhaul, with which recommendation I concur.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nFebruary 5th, 1948\n\nW.S. Arnell, Esq., Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Water Works System, Alert Bay Residential School\n\nEnclosed herewith please find a letter received this date from the residential School and concerns the present waterworks system at the school.\n\nIn this regard, I wish to advise that the Principal has on different occasions complained that the unit was not operating satisfactorily and I accordingly looked over the whole unit with a view to making my recommendation.\n\nThe system is required to pump into an 18,000 gallon storage tank which is situated about 400 yards from the well itself. The storage tank is about 75 feet above the head of the well, being located on a hill. The well itself is a drilled well depth being about 60 feet and enclosed in 3\" steel casing. The suction pipe to the pump is 3\" in diameter and discharges through the pump into a 3\" outlet.\n\nThe existing pump is of the \"Pomona\" type, and has apparently been in operation for a period of twenty years, and is undoubtedly in need of replacing. Marshall-Wells Company are agents for this particular type of pump.\n\nThe engine which drives the pump is of English manufacture and is known as a \"Fetter\" type. It is a 7. H.P. Diesel. This engine was apparently installed during 1934, and has given constant service since that time. It is impossible to obtain new parts, as this particular model has been discontinued. Any parts requiring replacement must therefore be made up by a machine shop. Now that a reliable source of electricity is available, it is suggested that consideration be given to having an electric motor installed.\n\nThe school being rather a large institution requires a large volume of water each day, and from the information\navailable we find that the present unit can only keep up with requirements after pumping from 10 to 11 hours each day. A unit of this size should be capable of pumping about 2500 gals per hour, whereas it is now pumping less than half that amount. The engineer at the school has informed me that if the pump fails to operate for one day, the school is extremely short of water. This causes a serious fire hazard as well as making sanitary conditions an impossibility. This did actually happen about the time of School Inspector Davey's inspection, and he no doubt can inform you of conditions at that time.\n\nI would also like to point out that we are taking off a small line from this particular system in order to get water to the new Indian Day School quarters which are adjacent to the area. This will not take any appreciable supply from the system, and is urgently required to put water into the teacher's residences which are included in the new unit.\n\nIt is understood that the Department will in the near future be going ahead with a new water system in Alert Bay Indian Village, and that this system will be extended to take in the Indian Day School. The present or proposed line which will be put into the Day school shortly will then act as a secondary line and can be used by the Residential School or the Day school in the event that either system fails.\n\nI would recommend that replacement of the existing pumping unit complete be proceeded with at the earliest possible moment, and definitely should be installed not later than the summer holidays.\n\n\"J.C. Letcher\"\nActing Indian Agent.\nSt. Michael's School\nAlert Bay, British Columbia.\n\nFebruary 8th, 1948\n\nThe Indian agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you know, the domestic water pump and engine have been giving us a great deal of trouble. On looking over the files in this office I find that the engine is a Petters Atomic Diesel 7 H.P. purchased and installed in May 1934. This engine is no longer reliable as many parts are badly worn. In October 1947 the Vancouver Agents for this engine stated that the engine is now a very old model and that parts are practically unobtainable from England as the manufacture of this model has been discontinued. Requests for a new engine or an electric motor were sent to the Indian Agent in October 1938, July 10th 1941, and May 17th 1942.\n\nThe domestic pump is a Domona installed in August 1929. The pump was last pulled in 1941 and new impeller blades were installed. In July 1945 the pump behaved in a spasmodic manner. The Agents for the pump suggested re-setting the impellers and this was done. On December 23rd 1947 the pump jammed. We called in the same mechanic who pulled the pump in 1941, and he suggested that one of the sections may have broken and dropped off. It was impossible to undertake a complete overhaul at that time, so he freed the pump and it has operated since, but at a considerably reduced output. Spare parts have been ordered but they will have to be specially made at the factory.\n\nIt is obvious that both the pump and engine have given good service and that both should be replaced.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"B.O.G. Dixon\"\nPrincipal.\nJune 21, 1948.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Water Supply - Alert Bay Village and Residential School.\n\nEnclosed for your information is a copy of a memorandum dated June 16th which has been received from the Lands and Development Services Branch in connection with the above. I understand that you have received a copy of Mr. Unsworth's memorandum.\n\nYou can arrange for the overhaul of the Petters engine. If it is found that it is not worth repairing you should report immediately stating the approximate cost of following out the suggestion that an electric motor be installed.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nOTTAWA June 16, 1948\n\nRe: Water Supply Alert Bay Village and Residential School\n\nAttached in duplicate is a report from Mr. Unsworth dated May 31, 1948 dealing with the equipment for the Alert Bay Residential School Water System. The following is a quotation of a letter from Mr. Webb dated June 10, 1948:\n\n\"I am forwarding herewith in triplicate memorandum by Mr. A. Unsworth dated May 31, 1948 covering examination of the pumping equipment at Alert Bay school, requested by the Indian Commissioner.\n\n\"You will note that Mr. Unsworth recommends that the Petters engine which drives this plant should be returned for overhauling to Vancouver, and if it is found that it is not worth repairing, consideration should be given to the installation of an electric motor.\n\n\"In view of the fact that we have now connected the new well with that at the school and can use either to supply both systems, it might be advisable to continue, if possible, to keep a power driven pump at the school well rather than depending on electric power for both wells.\n\n\"You will further note that if the pump is to be overhauled, Mr. Unsworth recommends that this work should be carried out at the end of this month when school closes.\n\n\"Two copies of this memorandum have been forwarded to W.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for British Columbia.\"\n\nIt would seem wise not to have both pumps operated by electric power so that the lack of power would not interfere with the operation of both at the same time. The Petters engine should be overhauled during the school holidays. We are expecting a further report from Mr. Unsworth on the matter of the installation of water supply for the Alert Bay village.\n\nChief Engineer,\n\nR. A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands & Development Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nMr. Hoey - For your information.\n\n17/6/48. Director.\nVancouver, B.C.\nMay 31, 1948\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nAlert Bay Residential School\nWater System\n\nAs instructed in your letter of April 27, 1948,\nI looked into the water system at Alert Bay Indian Residential\nSchool on May 16 to May 21 and hereby submit the following:\n\nThis residential school is situated on Lot 1957,\nRupert District. It is on Cormorant Island within a mile\nof the white settlement of Alert Bay, B.C. Two hundred and\ntwenty-five people and some thirty head of stock are dependent\nupon the water supply.\n\nPresent Water System\n\nThe present water system is as described in Mr.\nW.G. Warren's report of May 2, 1930 except that the 5 H.P.\ncrude oil engine as originally installed was replaced with a\n7 H.P. crude oil engine in 1934. (Letters referring to this\nreplacement are on file in the Indian Commissioner's office,\nVancouver, B.C.)\n\nDistribution System in Good Condition\n\nThe concrete storage tank and all steel and cast iron\nmains are in excellent condition. An inspection of all faucets\nand water closets at 11 p.m. on May 16, 1948 showed that these\nwere in good repair. A check on the storage tank level at\n9:15 p.m. May 20 to 6:15 a.m. May 21, gives further proof that\nthe piping system is in good condition. (See Appendix II)\n\nPumping Equipment\n\nSince the distribution system is without leaks, the\nexcess time of pumping could be contributed to unnecessary\nrunning of faucets or to poorly operating pumping equipment.\nThe pumping equipment consists of an Atomic Petters Engine\nrated at 7 H.P. at 650 r.p.m. This engine drives through a\n24\" pulley, a flat belt with a \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) turn to the pulley on a Pomona deep well turbine pump. According to the quotation of March 23, 1929 from Pumps and Power, this pump will deliver 30 to 50 U.S. gpm when operating at 1750 rpm. It is made up of 15 stages and the column is 3\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\" diameter, the drive shaft \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\)\" diameter stainless steel supported by ballless rubber bearings at 10 ft. intervals.\n\n**Test Runs on Pump**\n\nA test run of the pumping unit was made on May 16, 1948 and the data collected is given in Appendix I, together with a graph of quantity pumped in relation to pressure at surface of well. It should be noted that the pump ran at approximately 1610 rpm., the engine at 600 rpm, apparently being governed to that speed. If the engine ran at the rated speed of 650 rpm, the pump would run at 1750 rpm which closely corresponds to that shown on Pumps and Power quotation of March 22, 1929. A graph showing the expected capacity at the higher speed is also shown in Appendix I. By adjusting the setting of the impellers the quantity delivered can be varied somewhat.\n\nA further test was made on the pumping unit by recording the time operated and the water levels in the storage tank from day to day. This data is given in Appendix II. This data shows that the average daily consumption is 22,400 U.S. gallons or about 100 U.S. gallons per person per day.\n\nOn May 21 the engine was not running at 600 rpm but varied considerably. It is estimated it ran at \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) speed for much of the time. Also it was noted that on May 22 the engine was running poorly. On removal of base plate it was noted that the crank shaft bearing had excessive play. Timing gears seemed to be in good condition but cams were worn.\n\nThe pump itself cannot be checked thoroughly without withdrawing from the well but it is considered that it is in fair condition. The seizing which occurred in December, 1947 was probably due to the impellers running on the seats, which\nRecommendations\n\nIt is recommended that the Petter 7 H.P. Atomic Diesel Engine be removed from its foundation and shipped to the agents, namely, B. C. Equipment Co., of Vancouver, for advice and estimate on a complete overhaul. This firm has a complete stock of parts for this engine and it is considered by the undersigned that the engine will be found to be well worth overhauling. The freight and cartage from Alert Bay to Vancouver is estimated to be $6.35 for steamship freight and $6.65 for trucking, making a total of $13.00. Upon remounting the engine after overhauling, the pump impellers should be adjusted to the correct setting and a test run made. It is further recommended that some care be taken to prevent wastage of water.\n\nAlternative Recommendation\n\nIf the Petters engine is not found to be worth overhauling, consideration should be given to a direct drive electric motor, automatically controlled from a float switch in the reservoir.\n\nTime to do Work\n\nA new well on the school subdivision of Lot 1957 was interconnected to the Residential school system in May, 1948. This new well and pump can handle the requirements of the school when in session. However, as the well and equipment has not been proved over many days, it would be better not to depend on it until the summer vacation. Therefore, it is considered that the diesel engine for the Residential School well should be sent to Vancouver for overhaul immediately upon the closing of the school for summer vacation and the new well operated to meet school requirements. Overhaul should be complete in about twenty-one days.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Affairs advised on June 5th, 1941, that no funds could be made available for the work that year, and the matter has been dormant until the present. It is apparent that the amount of the 1941 estimated cost was included in the Indian Affairs 1948-49 annual estimates.\n\nNot only will the available funds be greatly below present costs, but water infiltration will have added tremendously to damage apparent when the report was made. A further investigation will be necessary, and it will not likely be possible to initiate work this year. Further the need for extensive plumbing repairs has arisen, and should be included when any additional examination of the building is made.\n\nWe are therefore writing to Mr. Webb at Vancouver, requesting him to assign an officer to this work, and to furnish us with a complete report, with estimate of cost. Upon receipt a summary with recommendations will be furnished to you for transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nMr. Hoey - For your information.\n\n23/8/48.\n\nA/Director.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nAccounts - St. Michael's Anglican Indian School, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nIn April, 1948, I received the enclosed certified account, dated 31st March, 1948, of Peterson & Edward of Alert Bay for $87.50 covering the provision and installation of a burner at St. Michael's School. I sent it to the Principal with instructions to take up with your local Agent the question of payment as it appeared to be a service for which your Department normally assumes responsibility in Government-owned Schools. I have just been advised by the Principal that your Agent has returned the account to him with advice that it must be paid by the School. I am forwarding this account to you with the request that it be paid direct by the Department under the provisions of your recent formula.\n\nI enclose also duplicate copies of a certified account dated 30th April, 1948, of Pumps and Power Limited, Vancouver (their invoice No. 9542-J) for $345.35 covering repair parts for pump. In forwarding this account, our Principal makes the following comment:\n\n\"The account with Pumps and Power Ltd although dated April 30 was incurred at the end of December, 1947, when we were having a good deal of trouble with the water pump. Mr. Letcher, then acting Indian Agent, was away for the Christmas holidays but as Mr. Todd was in Alert Bay I asked him for permission to buy these parts and he gave me that permission. I have nothing in writing to prove that but it seems to me that if proof in writing has to be produced for every conversation between a Principal and Indian Agent then there is something very wrong about the set-up.\"\n\nAs this service appears to be covered by your Formula for Government-owned schools, I would request that this account too be paid direct by the Department.\n\np.t.o.\nWill you please advise me of the action you take in regard to these two accounts.\n\nIt seems to me that it may well be that these are some of the accounts to which Mr. Todd referred when he advised you recently of complaints that school accounts are not being paid promptly; if so, it would appear that the fault does not rest entirely with the Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent\nAugust 31, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nThe attached account has been received from Indian Superintendent Todd.

Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Indian Residential School, Alert Bay.\n\nHerewith is estimate of cost of certain major repairs to the above school, discussed at that point last week:\n\nReplacement of floors - Assembly Room and Boys Room\n\nFlooring, approximately 4000 F.B.M. @ $120 $ 480.00\nLaying floor $ 160.00\nPainting etc. and contingencies $ 160.00\n$ 800.00\n\nConstruction Additional Ablution Room in Basement for Small Boys\n\n8 wash basins @ $35 $ 280.00\nInstallation $ 150.00\nPartition and doorway $ 50.00\nPainting etc. and contingencies $ 120.00\n$ 600.00\n\nPlease note in connection with above that we have not copy of plan of above school, therefore, before lumber is ordered exact dimensions of rooms in question should be secured.\n\nIn regard to proposed ablution room it has been\nconsidered that wash basins along one wall would be most advisable for available space, although if more basins are desired it would be best to install them on the opposite wall of this room. It does not appear that there is sufficient space for a double centre type basin such as used in present ablution room.\n\nC.E. Webb\nDistrict Chief Engineer\n\nPer:\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Repairs - Alert Bay Residential School\n\nAlthough an amount of $4000.00 was provided in the current appropriation for waterproofing the main building at the above mentioned school it is apparent that weather conditions will not permit of this work being undertaken this year.\n\nI recently visited the school with an engineer from Mr. Webb's office and with Superintendent Toad and as a result of this visit would recommend that certain other work be carried out instead of waterproofing. Additional information is required with regard to some of the repairs necessary but immediate action should be taken to effect repairs to the assembly room floor and the floor in the boys' playroom and an additional ablution room should be provided for the small boys in the basement of the building. The cost of this work is set out in Mr. C.E. Webb's letter of October 21st attached and I would recommend that the Department authorize an expenditure of the funds necessary for the completion of this work from the balance of the appropriation for the school this year.\n\nOther requirements of the school will be the subject of a separate communication at a later date.\n\nW.S.

Public Works, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to report that I have inspected the Machinery owned by\nthe DEPARTMENT of Mines & Resources (Indian Branch)\nand located at St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, B.C.\non the 29th day of September, 1948\nand have found it in the following condition:\n\n**Fire Pumps:**\n- **Condition:** Poor shape\n  - There are several fire extinguishers but none have been recharged since Oct. 1946.\n  - Fire extension ladder in poor shape. A new one should be supplied and marked plainly \"For Fire Purposes Only\". All electric wiring should be checked and modernised and all present wiring that is against safety regulations should be replaced with new material and only approved outlets allowed.\n\n**Condensate Pumps:**\n- **Condition:** One required\n\n**Boiler Feed Pumps:**\n- **Condition:**\n\n**Stokers:**\n- **Condition:**\n\n**Electric Lighting Plants:**\n- **Condition:** Two. (B.C. Power has just been installed)\n  - One worn out, one in fair shape.\n\n**Laundry Machinery:**\n- **Condition:** Lister Diesel Engine in poor shape.\n  - (All belting old and unreliable.)\n  - (Safety catch broken on Extractor.)\n\n**Steam Engines:**\n- **Condition:**\n\n**Gasoline Engines:**\n- **Condition:**\n\n**Diesel Engines:**\n- **Condition:** Lister laundry Diesel.\n  - Poor shape.\n\n**REMARKS:**\nThe entire plumbing and sewerage system should be checked and all obsolete fixtures and fittings replaced with modern material.\nThe laundry engine should be replaced with a large motor or individual machine motors now the B.C. Power line is connected to the building.\nRecondition the Fire Pump and engine.\nStricter supervision re cleanliness of basement plumbing fixtures and machinery is required.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBoiler Inspector, D.P.W.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6429, file 875-5, part II)\nOttawa, November 16, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nLANDS and DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH.\n\nRe: Alert Bay Residential School\n\nYour File: L.A.1756-3.\n\nWe have your memorandum of the 11th instant reporting on the repairs that are required at the above school.\n\nIt is understood that the items marked 1 and 2 should receive immediate attention and as soon as we receive a quotation from Mr. Ward we will give the matter further consideration.\n\nAt the present time we are not in a position to state definitely what amount will be available for repairs at this school during the fiscal year 1949-50 but as soon as we have this information you will be advised.\n\nActing Director.\n\nPP/HH.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Alert Bay Indian Residential School - Kwawkewlth Agency, B.C.\n\nRegarding memoranda from Director of Indian Affairs dated July 26th and August 5th and your marginal notes thereon, and further to our letter of August 20th, Mr. Webb has had a general survey made of the school and in a report dated November 2nd advises as follows:\n\n1. Arrangements were made to have Mr. Ward of Alert Bay submit a price to Indian Affairs for work in connection with an improvement to the hot water supply which it is considered will correct the present condition.\n\n2. It was also arranged to have Mr. Ward re-install the water supply pump engine which has been sitting outside the pumphouse since its return from overhaul in Vancouver. Cost of this is to be paid by Indian Affairs.\n\n3. The wooden floor in the Assembly Hall and Boys room requires replacement. An estimate re this work of $800.00 was supplied to the Indian Commissioner.\n\n4. The question of the provision of a second wash room for smaller boys was considered and an estimate of $600.00 re this has been supplied to the Indian Commissioner.\n\n5. The Preventorium in connection with this school was looked over. A considerable amount of repair work is necessary, chiefly as follows:\n\n   (a) Finishing basement and installing necessary drains...........$1,100.00\n   (b) Placing siding over basement.. 200.00\n   (c) Roofing - duroid type......... 300.00\n   (d) New furnace installed..........1,000.00\n   (e) Decorating and new lining of lower panel of wards with three ply or masonite................400.00\n\n   $3,000.00\n\nThe above figures are considered liberal and work, if done by contract, might be carried out for a lesser amount, and if so, any balance could be used for improvement of porches off the wards. These are very desirable. If detailed plans are required, arrangements will be made to secure these at an early date.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n6. Plumbing - Although plumbing in the school was reported to be in bad shape, an examination did not confirm this report. No taps were found to require repairs and, while some minor repairs are required to toilets, nothing which could not be considered maintenance was noted.\n\n7. Waterproofing - Unfortunately, due to the absence of the principal, who has in any case only been there a few months, and an almost completely new staff, also to the fact that Alert Bay was having an unusually dry spell, it was not possible to determine the full extent of the waterproofing urgently needed. The only part of the building on which details were secured were the front walls in the basement. It would appear that if the sum of $4,000.00 is again made available, it would be possible to contract for a certain part of this building, say the front, to be carried out during next summer season when rainfall is less likely than can be expected between now and the end of the fiscal year. It is suggested the work be done in June, July or August, when monthly precipitation average is in the vicinity of 2 inches, whereas the average increases from that figure to over 3 inches in December and is still 4.75 in March.\n\nIf it proposed to do this work in 1949-50, it is suggested work be done by contract and that tenders be called for in April so that successful tenderer can get work completed in the good months. In the meantime, arrangements will be made to inspect the building after a wet period to definitely determine the points in walls where leaks are occurring.\n\nRe Item 7, Waterproofing, it has been our experience that a partial waterproofing job is never satisfactory; moisture works around through the unwaterproofed areas and destroys the value of the work.\n\nThis report is supplied for transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch for inclusion or rejection in their 1949-50 estimates. If it is decided to do this work in whole or part, we will have Mr. Webb secure definite estimates.\n\nChief Engineer.\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS OF CANADA\n\nCertificate of Inspection of Steam Boiler.\n\nThis Certificate expires ...

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nIn view of the recommendation contained in your letter of the 7th instant, the Department approves the purchase of a washing machine at a cost of $160. for the Principal's living quarters at the Alert Bay Residential School.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nPP/HM\nJanuary 7th, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nThe Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School has requisitioned for a washing machine, for use in his residence, and Superintendent Todd has recommended the supply of this equipment. This is a matter which was discussed during the visit I made to the School and I am of the opinion that provision of an electric washing machine is warranted.\n\nA suitable machine is available in Vancouver at an approximate cost of $160.00. I would recommend that the necessary expenditure be approved.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Department of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nFrom past reports made in respect to St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, the Department is aware of conditions that have existed during recent years, and also that a concentrated effort is being made to bring the physical condition of this school back to where it should be.\n\nSeveral inspections have been made by officials from various Departments who are responsible for certain work to be done. Certain recommendations have been made, approved, and some money authorized for repairs. I have been giving personal attention to these repairs and I am pleased to advise you that what we have been able to complete to date has made a marked improvement, but there is still much to be done, particularly with heating, plumbing and electrical installations. The kitchen was allowed to get in a deplorable condition. The Department have completed the following repairs to date:\n\n1. Kitchen: Two large Army Camp cookhouse kitchen ranges (two ovens each) have been installed with new stove pipe. One kitchen range had coils put in it and connected up direct to a small hot water tank in the kitchen to give them surplus hot water.\n\nThe walls of the kitchen are glazed tile. A year ago the School obtained a spray gun and painted the ceilings and part of the walls with paint. The walls were very dirty and greasy and this was not removed before painting, which not only darkened the kitchen but made it necessary that we purchase special acid to remove the paint and grease from the walls before redecorating could be done. The tile walls should never have been painted but rather washed. The other equipment such as tables, cupboards, etc., have all been gone over, and the kitchen is now in excellent shape.\n\n2. The scullery equipment is being repaired, which is also now in good shape.\n\n3. The plaster on the dining-room walls was all falling off. This has been repaired and the room painted. This is also now in good shape.\n\n4. The boys' washroom has had the plumbing repaired and simple showers installed.\n\n5. New lockers in the boys' playroom have also been installed.\n\n6. Practically all broken window panes have been replaced.\n\n7. Repairs to the diesel pumping engine have been made at a cost of over $400.00, and a new belt for same was also purchased and supplied. Their domestic water system is now in good working order.\n\n8. A new electric washing machine for the residence has been purchased as well as some rugs for the residence and staff quarters.\n\nOther minor repairs too numerous to mention have been completed.\nMaterials to lay new floors in the auditorium and junior boys' playroom are ordered and expected shortly. This installation will be made immediately upon receipt of the materials.\n\nMaterials for back porch steps have been purchased and received and this installation is being made at the present time.\n\nMaterials to hook up our high pressure boiler with the hot water domestic tank have been purchased but the installation is being held up waiting one safety valve. It seems to me that if Gordon and Belyea, Ltd., cannot supply this an effort should be made to purchase it from some other firm in Vancouver so that we will get some hot water in the school. This installation has been delayed nearly two months waiting the receipt of this valve.\n\nSufficient fence material has been purchased and supplied the school. This will be built as a manual training project when weather permits.\n\nElectrical\n\nWhen this school was constructed no provision was made for sufficient outlets including plug-ins for radios, reading lamps in staff quarters and office. At that time very few electrical appliances were used. As years went by the Department installed a frigidaire, electrical appliances in the laundry and kitchen, with the result that the school administration made temporary connections resulting in exposed wires running in all directions all through the school. About a year ago the school electric light plant, after nearly twenty years service, collapsed with the result the administration made an arrangement with the B.C. Power Commission to use D.C. power. This change-over from D.C. to A.C. meant considerable of the electrical equipment was of no further use without being changed over accordingly. When the hook-up to the B.C. Power Commission A.C. transmission line took place, a proper installation was not made with the result that the line was overloaded and continually burning out. I discovered this during one of my inspections sometime ago and sent a local electrician to the school to change the lead-in to remove fire hazard; but even this is only a temporary installation.\n\nIn my opinion, all these exposed wires and temporary installations (none of which would pass Government regulations) are a real fire hazard to this building and the lives of those who live therein. I requested the local electrician to make a survey of the school and then make a report, so that the Department will have some indication as to what is necessary, and be a guide as to what should be done to make this building safe.\n\nI attach hereto copy of his report. In reviewing his report I feel it should be broken down into two parts: First, materials and labour to rewire and make necessary installations where necessary to comply with Government regulations. Second, to change over the present system of operating a diesel engine in the laundry to individual motors attached to each machine in the laundry; the diesel engine being worn out. I am fearful of fire and would kindly ask that Mr. Arnell give this his personal attention immediately upon his arrival back from the East.\n\nHeating\n\nThis school is inadequately heated under the present set-up and has been for a number of years. The Department of Public Works Boiler Inspector recommended to increase the efficiency of the plant that a condensation pump be installed. This recommendation has been made on two occasions by the Boiler Inspector but no action has been taken. I am recommending that the question of this installation should receive immediate consideration and referred to the Boiler Inspector with a request that he advise our Department the type of condensation pump that would be suitable to correct this situation. The residence and school proper have been cold this winter and we are fortunate that we have not had a great deal of illness. I believe the administration\npartially responsible for inadequate heat. In years gone by the school used mill-run coal almost entirely which, no doubt, gave a more intense heat. At the present time they are short of fuel and trying to fire the furnace with green, wet slabs to effect economy. However, I feel the Boiler Inspector's recommendation to install a condensation pump is necessary, and would ask that the installation of this be made as soon as possible.\n\nDomestic Hot Water Supply\n\nThis is very inadequate - so much so that they cannot obtain sufficient hot water to bath the children. The principal informed me yesterday that some of the children had not had a bath for two weeks. The hot water is heated by a small hot water jacket. This hot water jacket needs considerable repairs and the Boiler Inspector has recommended that a larger hot water heater should be installed of suitable type for three hundred people to take the place of the present small worn-out heater. I would recommend that we request the Boiler Inspector to advise us the type and size of hot water heater to be installed and that immediate action be taken to purchase same and have the installation made.\n\nThis is a very serious situation from a health point of view as it is not possible to have sufficient hot water for the children and staff. To give you some indication as to the unclean condition of the children, I should like to mention this. A few days ago I accompanied Dr. Barelay to the Residential School one evening and assisted him in tuberculin testing. Dr. Barelay asked me to scrub the arms preparatory to hypodermic injection. One hundred seventy children were tested and I was amazed to see the dirty condition of a great many of these children. It was so bad that even after I had scrubbed the arm with alcohol, Dr. Barelay returned several pupils to me thinking I had missed them. It was rather embarrassing to the principal but his reply simply was that they had no hot water and thus could not keep the children clean. I attach a letter from the principal re this situation which will be self-explanatory.\n\nI recall many years ago Mr. Anfield, then principal, having difficulty in getting sufficient hot water for domestic purposes. To overcome this the engineer put coils in one of the large boilers to supplement the hot water heater. Evidently this was against Government regulations because when the Boiler Inspector came the following year he ordered that they be removed. This was done and they have been struggling to get by ever since with the present small hot water heater. The Boiler Inspector has also recommended that certain installations be installed. This would help and I am enclosing requisition for this material. I also attach requisition for parts and materials ordered to be installed by the Boiler Inspector.\n\nI am informed $4,000.00 was provided in this year's estimates to waterproof the exterior walls of the Residential School, but due to the Engineers not being able to have the work done in suitable weather, this money will not be used for that purpose this year. I am drawing this to your attention because I believe every cent of this money should be used for emergency repairs such as purchasing necessary equipment to provide ample heat and hot water, also to purchase materials and rewire part of the building to make it safe and remove present fire hazard.\n\nThis somewhat lengthy report is being made to keep the Department fully aware as to conditions in this Residential School. I should like to say that our new principal, Rev. Edwin Allsopp, is doing his best to correct a difficult situation including the physical condition of the building and in the classrooms. I find the children cheerful and happy discipline improved. Mr. Allsopp seems to handle the children well and is liked and respected. When Mr. Allsopp assumed his duties as principal he undertook a difficult task but with patience, firmness and kindness, he is making progress.\n\nHe has been able to employ a first-class kitchen matron who has been with the Department for many years. Miss Muir is a good cook, provides excellent meals for both the children and the staff and this has been one of the main factors in bringing about a happy situation.\n\np.t.o.\nStaff problem is still a worry for the principal and until he obtains efficient supervisors, teachers and other staff members, particularly those in key positions, it will be impossible for him to do much more. The school has not been inspected this term. From observations during my many visits to this school in recent months my views are as follows:\n\nTeaching Staff: The manual training instructor appears to have accomplished very little during the term. He appears listless, with little initiative, and is not of much assistance to the principal. It is requested that the school inspector investigate this part of the curriculum thoroughly on his next visit to the school.\n\nThere are four classrooms, one of which is on the half-day system. Only one qualified teacher is employed and she is very good. The other three teachers were only supervisors in the school but were transferred to the teaching positions when a change in the staff took place. They have no teaching qualifications.\n\nEngineer and Matron: The engineer employed has no papers - not even fourth class, and in my opinion is one of the weakest members of the staff. On practically every visit I have made to the school I have found the boiler room and other parts of the building which come under his care in a filthy condition. He is very sloppy in his work and seems very uninterested. Minor repairs which he should be doing are left undone. On all my visits I have never found him actually working. He seems to like to sit around and complain about everything in general. I wish to point out that the Government have a very large investment in valuable equipment which needs constant attention; otherwise, we are going to be constantly called upon to make expensive, major repairs due to the fact that an inexperienced, inefficient person is in charge. I am going to be quite frank and say that I do not think he is rendering the service the principal needs to keep the school in good running order. I will be making a further report later in connection with this position.\n\nI also feel that the young matron, who has had little experience, is not able or willing to give the principal much support. I do not wish to comment further.\n\nOn most visits I find the school not as tidy and clean as I would like to see it but there is a vast improvement from a year ago. This, no doubt, can be attributed to lack of supervision.\n\nThe farm seems to be a thing of the past. The large herd of cattle which in former days supplied plenty of rich milk for the children, have now been disposed of. It can now only be considered as a vegetable and fruit garden. I believe the farming instructor is a very conscientious, faithful worker, and should be a real support to Mr. Allsopp.\n\nI understand the school have increased the wages slightly, effective as from January 1st, 1949, and I attach hereto copy of the present salaries paid.\n\nSome repairs and replacements in plumbing and sewerage are required are required, and this will be dealt with in another report.\n\nIn view of the fact that the school has permitted staff members to carry out alterations in the building proper to suit their personal needs, and that of the school, by making changes in electrical and plumbing installations, etc., without authority from our Department, and which has now proved dangerous to life and against standard Government regulations; I am recommending that our Department issue instructions that this be discontinued and that no changes or alterations be made in the physical condition of the building without proper authority from the Department.\n\np.t.o.\nI should like to state that the Rev. Allsopp is making a determined effort to correct the situation of a year ago, and is gradually succeeding. To me it is just a matter of having efficient staff - he cannot do it alone.\n\nThis office is giving him every support possible and will continue to do so, and it is hoped that the Indian School Commission will make every effort to obtain efficient help even though they may have to pay key employees a higher salary than at present. If that were done, I can see this school return to the high standard of efficiency of former years.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nEncs.\nSt. Michael's School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nFeb. 1st, 1949.\n\nMr. M. S. Todd,\nSuperintendent of Indian Agencies,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nRecently I had the occasion to call the attention of the Supervisors to the matter of appearance and cleanliness of the children resident in this school. I discovered that certain of the boys had not been bathed for a period of two weeks. The explanation given by the Supervisors concerned was to the effect that they had been unable to obtain sufficient hot water for bathing purposes. Also the grimy appearance of the boys' hands was due to the fact that hot water was not available for washing purposes.\n\nI would refer you to the Inspector's report dated October 1st, 1948, referring to remarks on sheet re Boiler No. 44262 where he states as follows: \"A new hot water heater should be installed, of suitable capacity for 300 people to take the place of the discarded heating pipes from the boiler.\" I have also received many complaints from staff members as to the inadequacy of the hot water supply.\n\nAs you are already aware, we find the Indian children generally subject to various skin diseases and it is important, as a matter of control, that strict cleanliness is insisted upon at all times.\n\nI shall be grateful if you would bring this matter to the attention of the Department of Indian Affairs with a view to having a new water heater system installed at the earliest possible moment. I assure you that every care is taken to ensure the economical use of the hot water supply. Nevertheless, you will realize from what I have stated above that, at the present time, it is absolutely impossible to obtain a regular supply of hot water comparable with the normal requirements of this institution with a total resident population of 230 people.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"J.

Keele, local resident electrician, will give the Department some indication as to the present condition of the school insofar as electrical installations are concerned, and the requirements necessary to comply with standard Government regulations.\n\nAs this report indicates a serious situation and immediate attention necessary to protect the school against fire, I am recommending that Mr. Keele be asked to submit a tender for the following:\n\n(1) To cover necessary materials and labour to have the school rewired according to standard Government regulations; this tender to include all necessary lighting fixtures and outlets.\n\n(2) To cover purchase of motors, materials and labour for the installation of same in connection with the laundry.\n\nMr. Keele's figure of $3,150.00 was not a tender but rather an estimate to give the Department some indication of what was necessary and the cost. I believe Mr. Keele would supply the motors at retail price, less 10%, and do the work on an hourly basis if the Department so wished; and in my opinion the cost would be considerably less than the estimated amount he mentioned.\n\nYour early consideration to this will be appreciated.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Superintendent.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJan. 29th, 1949.\n\nMr. M.S. Todd,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI recently made a service call at the Indian Residential School to repair defective wiring originally installed to power a one h.p. refrigeration plant.\n\nI found that the original two wire 110 volt, 30 ampere service was powering, in addition to the original load of the refrigerator plant, two motor-driven 120 watt Ironers; one 1000 watt Hand Iron; a one-third h.p. motor; two employees' houses and five outlet receptacles. This load on an overfused switch resulted in heat damage to the switch to the extent that it was useless. I made temporary repairs and returned next day to make a more careful survey of the wiring in the school in company with the school engineer.\n\nThe original wiring installed for 110 volt D.C. current was adequate for the restricted capacity of the plant in use.\n\nWhen use of this plant was discontinued and 220 volt A.C. was drawn from city mains, and power equipment added in the laundry and at other points in the building, a lot of makeshift wiring was put in and in many cases this wiring is not only a fire hazard but is dangerous to personnel.\n\nThe building throughout is inadequately lighted by any standard and except where they have been added since the original wiring there are no outlet receptacles. This has resulted in improvised circuits strung on lamp cord in many parts of the building\u2014a dangerous practice at best.\n\nThe diesel motor powering the laundry machines is ready for replacement. With this in mind, and general state of the wiring throughout the building, disrepair and inadequacy, I would strongly recommend that a new three phase 220 Volt A.C. service be installed, and that the original lighting circuits in good repair be powered from this.\n\nThat wiring in disrepair and other dangerous circuits be replaced and powered from this.\n\nThat the washing machines be powered by individual motors and the line shaft and belting be discarded.\n\nThat additional circuits be installed to provide at least a minimum standard of good lighting in classrooms, sewing rooms, dormitories, infirmaries, offices, work rooms and recreation rooms.\n\nFollowing are listed points in the building where improvements are necessary:\n\nTwo playrooms require outlet receptacles.\n\nKitchen requires additional lighting and outlet receptacles.\n\nPower kitchen mixer be replaced or powered with A.C. motor. (Now done.)\n\nExhaust fans in drying rooms be replaced by A.C. units. Wiring to these should be replaced.\n\nLaundry requires outlet receptacles for irons and mangle.\nEngine room requires outlet receptacles for power tools and trouble lights.\n\nBoiler room requires additional and improved lighting.\n\nMain offices require additional lighting and outlets for best illumination.\n\nFifteen staff rooms now using lamp cord circuits require properly wired outlet receptacles.\n\nSewing rooms require additional lighting and outlet receptacles.\n\nDispensary requires more light and outlet receptacles.\n\nAn infirmary used for x-ray and dental clinics requires improved lighting and adequate outlet receptacles.\n\nBoys' infirmary requires more light and provision for heat treatments, etc.\n\nThe principal's residence requires outlet receptacles in living-room and kitchen.\n\nThe garage requires three lights and one outlet receptacle for small power tools.\n\nThe farmer's house has an inadequate entrance service. Requires porch light.\n\nEngineer's house requires improved entrance service. Dangerously inadequate wiring to outlet receptacles should be replaced.\n\nListed are items only intended to provide a minimum standard of lighting and service outlets for an institution of this type and such changes and additions as will bring the wiring within the minimum requirements of the Electrical Code.\n\nThe type and cost of added lighting fixtures and machines would decide the overall cost of carrying out such a program of improvement but, providing for laundry motors, exhaust fans for drying rooms and A.C. motor for kitchen mixer and fluorescent fixtures for the sewing rooms, together with all wiring, appliances, materials and labour, the final cost would not exceed $3,150.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"W. Keele\"\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nDuring my absence from duty in 1948 Mr. J. C. Letcher, Acting Indian Agent, arranged for the purchase of the material listed on the attached invoice #5799 of Stanley Brock Ltd., Vancouver. When the invoice was received no prepaid freight bill was attached and accordingly the voucher was paid less the $2.00 prepaid charges, as shown on the invoice. At the same time we wrote to Stanley Brock Ltd. requesting them to forward us the prepaid express bill but heard nothing from them.\n\nLater a letter was received from Canon H. G. Cook, Superintendent of the Indian School Administration, in which he was making inquiries about the payment of this invoice and also another one from Stanley Brock Ltd. Upon investigation we find Stanley Brock Ltd. billed the Indian School Administration, Ottawa, for $1.40, it being additional charges covering prepaid express on their invoice #5799. Prepaid express bill covering the charges was attached to the invoice and is now in the office of the Indian School Administration, Ottawa.\n\nEvidently the School broke a hinge on the extractor in the laundry and ordered another one to replace the broken part. This was done without consultation with the Department, and it is presumed they felt it was a rightful charge against the school and intended to pay for it themselves but failed to do so. I attach hereto copy of invoice #6346 covering this account in the amount of $17.90.\n\nAs we are unable to obtain the prepaid express bill covering invoices #5799 and #2242, and as the Department did not authorize the charges amounting to $17.90, I am forwarding the file direct to Ottawa and would kindly ask that you interview Canon Cook relative to his payment of this account in the amount of $17.90. The payment of $3.40 express charges is the responsibility of our Department but we cannot do anything about it as the Indian School Administration have the receipted express bill in their office.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nEncs.\nAIR MAIL\n\n14th February, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nIndian Superintendent Todd has forwarded to us a copy of his letter dated 1st February, 1949, addressed to you with reference to conditions at the Alert Bay Residential School. Attached to this communication were copies of letters received from the Reverend Principal of the Alert Bay School and also Mr. W. Keele.\n\nNo action is being taken on Mr. Todd's letter until we receive a report from your office.\n\nPP/ST Bernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n14th February, 1949.\n\nRev. Canon H.G. Cook,\nThe Indian School Administration,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter written to us by Superintendent Todd, and also an account from Stanley Brock Limited.\n\nWe would appreciate being informed regarding your side of this transaction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F. Neery,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nPP/ST\nAttachs.\nOttawa, 23rd February, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nRe: Alert Bay Indian Residential School, Kwawkewlth Indian Agency, Province of British Columbia\n\nIt is our understanding that one of your engineers expects to make an inspection trip to Western Canada.\n\nIn the appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50, we have provided funds which we hope will be sufficient to make extensive repairs to the boiler room at this school.\n\nIf possible, your engineer should visit this school and on his return report to us what work is required.\n\nP/ST Director.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Alert Bay Residential School\nYour file 875-5 (E.1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Pratt's letter of February 14th and Supt. Todd's report of February 1st regarding conditions at the Alert Bay Residential School, there has been some delay in dealing with this matter due to difficulty in determining exactly what is required and securing prices and estimates of costs. Even now it is apparent that some of the requirements cannot possibly be attended to this fiscal year. Mr. Todd has dealt with these requirements under various headings:\n\n(1) Electrical: Mr. Keele's report with regard to the wiring, etc., is quite comprehensive but is not sufficiently detailed to form a basis for a contract with him. Mr. Todd is being requested to discuss the matter with him with a view to securing a detailed tender on the work necessary.\n\n(2) Heating: We are presently awaiting advice from the Dominion Boiler Inspector with regard to specifications for the new hot water heater and the condensation pump for Boiler No. 44261. Items other than these as listed on the attached requisition can be secured locally at an approximate cost of $410.00. $125 of this amount is for a new smoke box for the boiler, delivery of which cannot likely be made before March 31st. If funds to the extent of $285 for purchase of the other items can be made available\nimmediately I would request that I be so advised by Army Signals so that delivery can be taken before March 31st.\n\nOther items referred to in Mr. Todd's letter will be dealt with at a later date. My object in writing now is to request authority for an expenditure of $285.00 for materials to repair the heating equipment.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMr. W.S.

I regret that I did not write you a covering letter explaining this expenditure as there was no authorization given by Ottawa prior to the work being done.\n\nFor your information both these engines broke down about the same time which meant immediate action had to be taken. Prior to this breakdown Commissioner Arneil had inspected the School in company with myself and the late Col. Whyte of the Surveys and Engineering Branch. At that time the School Engineer pointed out to us that neither engine were working properly and we had had under consideration reporting the matter to Ottawa and requesting authority to have these units overhauled, but before I could take this action the breakdown occurred.\n\nAs the work had to be done to protect the school from fire and to allow them to continue with their laundry, I immediately arranged for a local mechanic to have the repair work done. I have no other explanation and trust that this will be satisfactory. I might add both units are now working properly.\n\nPossibly I should also say here that the Engineer in charge at the Residential School has no papers, not even fourth class, and I have found him reluctant to make ordinary repairs. The feeling seems to be not only with the engineer himself but with the Principal himself that any repair work necessary is the responsibility of the Department with the result that as you now know, the Department have spent considerable money in this school during the past year.\n\np.t.o.\nIf our equipment received the same attention as in former years a great many breakdowns and major repairs would not occur, and it is for this reason that I am bringing it to your attention. My own opinion is that we should have an experienced engineer capable of doing ordinary repairs as needed, which would give better supervision and greater care to our equipment.\n\n(M. S.

File #6-11-3.\n\nAs requested, the Department forwarded an accountable advance amounting to $590.00 to cover the repairs recommended by the late Col. Whyte. In addition to this we had a small balance of $23.70 left over from an accountable advance forwarded by the Department, their cheque #51045 of July 16/48, for minor repairs to the Residential School.\n\nAs the time was getting short and as I was having difficulty to find suitable labour to complete the above mentioned work, I went to Mr. T. Westerlund, local contractor, and informed him of the work the Department required done, and asked him if he would undertake the work by day labour, pointing out it had to be done by March 31st, as that was the end of our year.\n\nMr. Westerlund accompanied me to the school where I showed him the work which was required to be done and he then stated it would be far better for him to take a contract to complete the job, as it was already evident there was a shortage of some materials which had been ordered on instructions from the Surveys and Engineering Branch. Mr. Westerlund agreed to supply any shortages of material and provide all the labour for the full amount of $598.40.\n\nAs this was the only way in which I could complete this work before the end of the year, I drew up a tender which covered the necessary material and all labour to complete the job, and this was signed by Mr. Westerlund.\n\np.t.o.\nAs we did not have time to submit this to the Department and complete the work before the end of the year, I asked Mr. Westerlund to proceed with the work on this basis.\n\nThe work was completed by March 31st and we received a very satisfactory job and I attach the tender to the Credit Voucher #347, and trust the Department will approve of the action I have taken.\n\n(M.

Mr. Todd should be aware that he has no authority to enter into a contract involving an expenditure of this amount, but as the work is completed and payment made to Mr. Westerlund, there would appear to be no alternative but to forward the voucher for whatever action may be necessary.\n\nW.S.

Mr. Hargreaves informed our Principal that on his return to Ottawa he would prepare plans, specifications and recommendations on the work needed to ensure the proper functioning of these installations and that, provided necessary funds and Departmental approval were forthcoming, it should be possible to put the necessary work in hand within the next three months.\n\nIt will be greatly appreciated if approval can be given Mr. Hargreaves recommendations and necessary funds provided so that these installations can be put in proper working order before the next winter season. In the matter of funds, will you please see our letter of 28th August, 1948, (acknowledged by your 156-0-5(E.1) of 7th September, 1948) submitting a list of services at the above School for inclusion in your 1949-50 Estimates; this list includes work on sewage, plumbing and heating systems.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHenry G.

C., Department of Mines & Resources,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\nAttached find requisition for materials received from Principal Allsopp for repairs to various projects. In submitting this requisition there is some doubt in my mind whether it is our responsibility to provide this material or not.\n\nThe 18\u00bd M Shingles is to reshingle the woodshed and root house. These old buildings were not built by the Department but rather by the school itself. In regard to the reshingling of the woodshed this building was built by the school as a cover for wood when they changed over from burning coal to wood. When the school was built the Department provided a fuel bin for coal sufficient to take care of their needs but later the school thought they could reduce the cost of fuel by burning wood and this building was erected. I am inclined to feel that if they wished to use this building it is the school's own responsibility and they should pay for the repairs out of the grant.\n\nIn regard to the shingles for the root house, this also was built by the school but now as they have no stock and not using the barn I can see no reason why the vegetables cannot be stored therein and used as a root house.\n\nThe item on this requisition which I feel is the responsibility of the Department is the 2,000 fbm. 2 x 10 Rough Fir Planking, which is to be used to repair steps and sewerage covers. I will mark on the requisition the items I consider we should supply.\n\nIf the Department considers they should supply the total requisition, it is satisfactory with me but I felt I should give you this information so that you can make a decision as to responsibility.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nEncs.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Alert Bay Residential School\n\nI wrote you under date of June 18th with regard to the amount provided in the current Estimates for repairs and for the purchase of equipment for the Alert Bay Residential School, requesting advice as to whether or not in view of the expenditures already made and chargeable to appropriation, and the contemplated expenditure for waterproofing the building, additional funds would be available.\n\nIn the interval we have received the attached communications dated June 20th from Supt. Todd and requisitions for certain materials for improvements to the school. The lumber and nails requisitioned will cost approximately $400 and the paint, etc., approximately $250. Will you please advise if it will be in order for us to proceed with the purchase of the items requisitioned.\n\nDespite Mr. Todd's comments with regard to the responsibility which the Department may or may not have in connection with the woodshed and the root house, it is felt that if these buildings serve a useful purpose and are to be maintained the Department should contribute towards the cost as part of our program for the improvement of general conditions at the school.\n\nW.S.

It is hoped that a decision will be reached at an early date as to how this project is to be handled and that action will be initiated as soon as possible.\n\nJUL 7 1949\n\nT.E. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, July 5, 1949.\n\nRes: Alert Bay Indian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, British Columbia.\n\nIn accordance with a request from Major MacKay, you are advised that our Mr. Hargreaves visited the above on the 5th and 6th of June, and carried out an inspection of the mechanical services. His report may be summed up as follows:\n\nThis building was erected in 1929 and is generally substantially sound. It must be stated however, that additional attention to general all round cleanliness would make conditions more attractive inside and out.\n\nThe heating plant consists of two portable fire box type steel low pressure steam heating boilers of approximately 44 horsepower each, with an allowable working pressure of up to 10 lbs. per square inch, permitted by the Provincial Boiler Inspector on his 1949 inspection report. The boilers are fired with slab wood of very poor quality in an effort to cut operating expenses.\n\nThe distribution system consists of a two pipe low pressure steam and is run to the various parts of the building in a fairly good manner with some exceptions. The Principal's residence which is integrally built, is impossible to heat. This is caused by a faulty arrangement of the branch mains in the basement of this area.\n\nCondensation is returned to the boilers by gravity through a combination boiler return trap and air eliminator assembly, which is not in good operating condition, thereby contributing to improper circulation. As the result of this design, in which no traps are used at the ends of the mains and branch mains, the rooms farthest from the boiler can not be properly heated.\n\nThe radiation is sufficiently large with some exceptions. The radiator traps and valves appear to be in relatively good condition and should function efficiently when the problem of distribution is overcome.\n\nThe domestic hot water requirements could never be met with the present undersized burnt out, and ill-designed equipment. The domestic hot water storage tank has capacity of approximately 800 gallons and appears to be sound. The jacket heater is practically burnt out, and is far too small to cope with the normal demand. A line connected to the tank from the high pressure boiler does not, nor could be expected to materially increase the heating capacity even if no other service from this boiler was to be provided. The high pressure boiler is rated at 165 horsepower and the hourly heating rate of the domestic hot water demand is equal to a minimum of 25 horsepower. The high pressure boiler incidentally is in good condition and large enough to meet the requirements of the laundry services for which it was originally intended.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIn addition to the foregoing, various arrangements of coils in the heating boilers have been tried out and have failed. On one attempt to increase the domestic hot water capacity, coils were installed in the smoke box of one of the heating boilers. This has resulted in the smoke box rusting out when the coil broke and will have to be replaced as soon as possible, in order to keep this boiler in service.\n\nIt was noted that the domestic hot water piping system was somewhat undersized, but it is felt that it is unnecessary at this time to replace it in its entirety. This piping will in all probability have to be replaced however within the next 5 to 6 years.\n\nThe drainage system was brought to the attention of our officer. It was reported by the caretaker and Principal, to be plugged in some sections. Careful observations on the part of our officer leads us to believe that most of this trouble has been the result of a lack of supervision in the basement where the bulk of the plumbing fixtures are. The same holds true with the dormitory where several W.Cs are located for emergency use at night.\n\nOne floor drain in the basement was found to be packed solid with sand and dirt and it is logical to blame this on improper supervision and a lack of good housekeeping. The drainage system will have to be cleaned out and it has reached the stage where the maintenance staff at the school can not cope with this job, due to the lack of suitable tools and a knowledge of how to use them.\n\nOur officer was informed that the underfloor drains were laid in tile, but could find no basis to support this. Tile lines are used outside the building to carry raw sewage to a discharge point in the bay with no intervening septic tank. This is a deplorable method as much of the raw sewage is washed on to the beach at high tide. If a septic tank were installed, the effluent could then be safely discharged into the bay.\n\nIn order to bring the various mechanical services up to the minimum required efficiency, it is recommended that the following operations be carried out:\n\n(a) Re-grade spring pieces and run-outs to risers and radiators where necessary.\n\n(b) Install float and thermostatic traps at ends of all steam and branch mains.\n\n(c) Remove present boiler return trap and air eliminator assembly and replace with suitable condensation pump and receiver making some minor changes to the piping at the rear of the boilers.\n\n(d) Replace pipe covering on steam mains and branches, in sections where it has been torn off.\n\n(e) Remove branch mains in basement in Principal's residence and replace in a manner which will be outlined on drawings.\n(f) Provide an indirect steam fed heater of suitable capacity to provide adequate means of heating the domestic hot water and in conjunction with same, install self contained regulating valve assembly, for automatic control of water temperatures.\n\n(g) If it is decided to convert from wood to coal, it would be highly desirable to install one stoker of the proper size and characteristics.\n\n(h) In addition to the foregoing operations, there will be several minor items to be taken care of, which can only be determined when a layout and specification is prepared.\n\nThe foregoing operations cannot be accurately estimated until plans and specifications are prepared, but it may be safely assumed that if the work recommended is carried out, it will cost in the neighborhood of $8,500.00.\n\nWhen advised that approval has been given, we will proceed with the design covering the revisions to the mechanical services as soon as possible.\n\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS\n\nIt was noted that the wiring was in a very dangerous state. Exposed lines together with evident over-loading of circuits contributes a very real source of fire hazard. Fuses are blowing regularly and the Principal was warned not to permit the use of heavier fuses than those now being used.\n\nThe fire pump located in a pump house at the bay about 1/8 of a mile from the school, was undergoing repairs. The impeller was found to be clogged with bark, pieces of wood and other foreign matter. This indicates that the strainer is either missing or so badly deteriorated, that it is of no further use. It was also noted that the governor on the diesel engine which drives this pump was not functioning properly and attempts to make satisfactory repairs had not been successful. The Indian Superintendent, Mr. Todd, was advised to replace this governor as well as to install a strainer at the end of the intake line to the pump.\n\nThe boilers appear to be in good condition, but the boiler room staff was not impressive. The boiler room was in a filthy condition and there is no excuse for such lack of attention on the part of any fireman or operating engineer. It is felt that if this fireman is to be retained, he should be advised to clean up and pay more attention to ordinary mechanical maintenance duties, which is certainly an important part of his work, and which can be expected to contribute to longer life of all items of mechanical equipment.\n\nIt is also felt that the fire pump should be connected to a suitable electric motor with a starting switch located in the Principal's office as well as a switch in the Pump House. This would assure positive starting of the fire pump when required, whereas under the present arrangement, the diesel engine must be started by hand after the operator has had time to reach the pump house.\n\nThe foregoing remarks under the heading of General Observations are not definite recommendations included in our rough estimate, but suggestions only.\n\nChas.

It is concerned with an old standing complaint, that rain enters through the brick walls, and dates as far back as 1936. In 1938 repairs to roof and waterproofing of a portion of the east wall residence was undertaken, a sum of approximately $1,345.00 having been made available.\n\nSince that date a number of inspections have been made and reports submitted, the latest being the present report from Mr. D.W. Gordon, dated June 24th, 1949, which in effect supports previous recommendations. The essential facts are as follows:\n\nA portion of the east wall of the main school building and the residence have been waterproofed and appear satisfactory.\n\nThe report recommends that the following work be done:-\n(a) the remaining portion of the exterior east wall and the entire exterior south wall be waterproofed (b) the infirmary gun room, which has settled, be raised and repaired (c) the roof along the south wall parapet be repaired (d) repair two leaks in residence and a crack in north concrete basement wall. All the repairs have to do with rain entering the building, a condition which is considered serious.\n\nThe cost of the above work is estimated at $4,400.00 and Mr. Gordon recommends that the work be carried out on the basis of cost plus a percentage. Mr. Gordon's statement that the work might require a contractor's fee of 15% is interpreted to mean a profit of approximately 10% with 15% for other items usually considered as payable charges exclusive of the actual cost of materials.\n\nWe consider Mr. Gordon has submitted a good report and the recommendations are concurred in, but if Indian Affairs can find funds for the work, comparative prices must be obtained for the waterproofing and roofing, and we would request Mr. Webb to provide supervision for the work while in progress.\n\nA copy of same with Mr. Webb's covering letter is attached for the information of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nR.

Webb, Esq.,\nDistrict Engineer,\nVancouver, B. C.\n\n16 June, 1949\nVancouver, B.C.,\n16 June, 1949\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Webb:\n\nRe: Waterproofing\nSt. Michael's School, Alert Bay,\nKwawkewlth Agency, B.C.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions of May 13, 1949, I visited St. Michael's School at Alert Bay. The following are my observations.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Report on Proposals for Further Waterproofing of Walls and Repairs to School Roof at Alert Bay School, Kwawkewlth Agency, by W. C. Warren dated July 21, 1937.\n\n2. Report on Inspection of St. Michael's School Alert Bay, Kwawkewlth Agency and Waterproofing Recommended by W. C. Warren, dated February 6, 1941\n\nLocation\n\nSt. Michael's School is situated at Alert Bay on Cormorant Island some 200 miles north-west of Vancouver, B.C. Alert Bay has a regular steamboat service several times a week and a daily plane service from Vancouver. The school property adjoins the Nimpkish I.R. No. 1, Kwawkewlth Agency.\n\nGeneral Description of School\n\nThe outside walls consist of brick veneer, structural tile backup, wooden furring strips, metal lath, and plaster. The outside brick construction is struck joint in common bond. The horizontal joints average almost half an inch in thickness, the maximum about three-quarters of an inch. Vertical joints are narrower on the average.\n\nThe bricks, being run of the kiln, are not of good quality and are pitted and possibly although none of these defects appear serious. The mortar is good and has not parted off.\nThe sand in the mortar appears to be coarser at the top of the building than at the bottom.\n\nThe east wall of the main school building and the residence have been waterproofed, as described in a report by W. G. Warren, dated February 6, 1941, and are still in good condition. See photo Number One in Appendix I. Most of the cracks and pitting in the south wall and parts of the north wall of the main building, laundry and auditorium walls have been filled with Minwax Caulking Compound. This compound is still in fairly good shape and seems to be sealing the cracks successfully. See photo Number Two in Appendix I. It has peeled and hardened at the outer fringes of thin sections but this separation is not spreading beyond the fringes.\n\nDuring the winter of 1948-49, no water has leaked through the walls of the school except in three localized areas which are discussed later. However, this winter has been colder than usual with the result that much of the precipitation has been in the form of snow, and the driving south-easterly rain storms, which penetrated the school in previous years, have been absent. At the time the school was visited by the undersigned, Alert Bay was enjoying warm, dry weather and therefore the effect of water penetration was not evident in most places.\n\nDefects Causing Leakage\n\n1. There is a large crack on the north cement wall of the west basement. Water entered here last winter. This could be closed by chipping the crack out clean and refilling with cement and a waterproofing compound.\n\n2. The reported leakage into the infirmary sun room has evidently resulted from a settling of the front brick column supports of the room. These supports have settled until the roof slopes away from its drain and the\ntop west side of the roof has come away from the main outside wall of the school as much as three-quarters of an inch. The supports will have to be adjusted before any caulking or waterproofing can be attempted.\n\n3. On the main roof where the roofing sheet meets the parapet wall, it does not, in some places, lap up under the copper flashing. One bad section, in this respect, was along the eastern part of the south face of the main building. It should be noted that a lot of the seepage reported during the past few years was on floors and basement below this section.\n\n4. There were two leaks at the residence, both active last winter. One was over the doorway between the residence and the school; the other was in the ceiling of the residence bathroom on the second floor. Neither of the sources of these leaks could be established. The roof appears to be watertight, the drains are clear, and the caulking and waterproofing above the doorway on the residence roof and the school east wall is good. It is considered that the water is entering in narrow localized holes or cracks and not seeping through large areas or walls or roof.\n\n5. The caulking around the windows on the south side of the school, especially on sides and bottom is poor and needs replacing. The window caulking on the other walls is better but not good. However, the seepage on the south side which has occurred in previous years does not seem to have entered the inside walls around the windows.\n\nGeneral Location of Leakage in Previous Years\n\nThe south inside wall of the east wing on the second and third floors has leaked. The plaster has been saturated mostly between the ceiling and windows.\n\nThe plaster on the south and east part of the west dormitory on the top floor has been saturated from the floor to\na height of four feet. Water has also come in from the upper south-east corner of this dormitory.\n\nThe basement of the east wing has on several occasions collected one to two inches of water which has apparently drained down the south wall. The plaster is directly on the concrete in the basement.\n\nMoisture has collected on parts of interior walls on other rooms facing south but not on as large areas nor as harmful as the areas just described.\n\nLeakage on the east wall of the laundry was stopped when the drains were cleared.\n\nIt must be remembered that the discussion in this section is based partly upon conversations carried on at the school with persons previously employed there, and partly upon the evidence remaining on the walls concerned.\n\nMETHODS OF REPAIRS TO THE SCHOOL\n\n1. Infirmary Sun Room\n\nThe front part of the sun room should be raised to its original correct elevation with screw jacks and 6\" x 6\" columns, using the assembly shown in Sketch Plan I. Then, steel shims inserted on top of the brick columns and the remaining space on the columns grouted in. The earth should be dug out around the present footings, half of one column at one time, and concrete support added to the footings as shown in Sketch Plan II. The total cost, including labour and materials, is estimated to be $550.00. Cost details are given in Appendix II.\n\nII. Roof Repairs\n\nThe roofing along the south wall of the main school should be repaired in the following manner:\n\n1. Clean gravel off present roofing surface up to two feet from the parapet wall.\n2. Raise flashing enough to work on parapet.\n\n3. Brush wall surface clean and apply layer of Plastic Elastic Gum to it and the cleared two foot section of roof.\n\n4. Apply three layers of felt, each smeared with Plastic Elastic Gum, to cover cleared roof and to lay up parapet wall 8 to 10 inches.\n\n5. Copper flashing, see details in Sketch Plan III, to be inserted and nailed to roof deck.\n\n6. One layer of twelve inch wide felt smeared with Plastic Elastic Gum and layed horizontal, covering flashing as shown in Sketch Plan III.\n\n7. Second layer eighteen inch wide felt applied as in 6.\n\n8. Roofing surface relaid using Plastic Elastic Gum and then gravelled.\n\n9. Replace caulking on parapet where necessary.\n\nThe total cost, including labour and materials, is estimated to be $530.00. Cost details are given in Appendix II.\n\nIII. Waterproofing Outside South Wall of Main School and Small Portion of East Wall not already Waterproofed\n\nThe total area is 7800 square feet. The net area, excluding windows and doors, is 6000 square feet. See Sketch Plan IV.\n\nThe waterproofing can be done by this office or by contract with some approved waterproofing firm.\n\nIf done under supervision of this office, the method would be as follows, using Minwax products.\n\n1. Brush down wall surface.\n\n2. Point and re-caulk brick where necessary.\n3. Re-caulk around all windows and other openings.\n\n4. Apply three coats Minwax Brick and Cement Coating of appropriate colour, the first two coats to be thinned with Minwax Brick and Cement Coating Thinner.\n\n5. Paint brick molding on windows, two coats.\n\nThe total cost of above, including labour and materials, is estimated to be $3,300.00. Cost details are given in Appendix II.\n\nThe Minwax treatment could also be done by contract, probably at the same cost. However, if contracting the work is to be considered, there are available waterproofing materials which are applied with special equipment by trained operators. In some instances, the company distributing the material have their own machines and personnel for the work and in other cases, certain contracting firms specialize in the use of a specific product. Two materials which come under the above category are \"Insul-Mastic\" and \"Tremco\" products.\n\nThe cost of contracting the above is estimated to be approximately $3,500.00.\n\nThe estimated useful life of these treatments is in excess of ten years.\n\nAll of the waterproof coatings discussed have one feature in common, that is, they completely cover the brickwork and the distinctive mortar lines are lost, thus changing the pleasing architectural characteristics of a brick building. They are also subject to possible changes in colour themselves by chemical action, usually within one or two years after application. Although these changes do not affect the waterproofing qualities of the covering, the good appearance of the school might have to be restored by painting.\n\nThere are available waterproofing agents that do not alter the appearance of the original brick structure. These are transparent substances which deter absorption and have a\nprobable life of three to five years; comparable to the life of an ordinary paint covering. The successful use of these products necessitates the prior pointing or caulking of all holes and cracks in the brick as well as caulking around openings of doors and windows. The difficulty in ensuring the absolute sealing of all cracks in the expanse of wall at the school and the short useful life of the treatment discourages its use.\n\nIV. Repairing Two Leaks at Residence and Crack in North Concrete Wall of West Basement\n\nThese repairs could be made easily at the same time as I and II with a slight extra cost of $20.00.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nIt is respectively recommended that the repairs to the concrete wall in the west basement, and to the infirmary sun room supports be carried out before October this year by this office. Total Cost $570.00.\n\nThe repairs to the school roof can be contracted or done on a cost plus basis as well as by this office. Contracting, or cost-plus, by a recognized roofing company is recommended for the following reason.\n\nThe repairs to the roof, although of a minor nature and not expensive, are vitally important to the state of the building. Any other waterproofing applied to wall, etc., will be nullified if the roof is not sound. Thus, the work could be accomplished to a greater degree of reliability by a company who are specialists in roofing and roof repair.\n\nThe cost-plus arrangement is preferred for the reason that it would be less costly than a contract. A contractor bidding on the job would have to provide for the contingency attendant upon wet weather which is a\ncommon occurrence in that area, whereas, on the cost-plus basis, if fair weather prevails, a saving is effected.\n\nThe estimate cost of repairing the roof is $530.00.\n\nIt is further recommended that the waterproofing to the south wall be done during July and August by a reputable waterproofing company rather than under direction of this office. This is suggested because:\n\n1. Labour and tradesmen are very difficult to obtain at Alert Bay during the summer.\n\n2. Waterproofing a building of this size is expensive and can be better done by skilled tradesmen under experienced and qualified supervision.\n\nTotal cost of roof repairs, infirmary repair, and waterproofing south wall is estimated to be $4,400.00.\n\nIt is suggested that the window frames of the school be painted and the stucco on the infirmary sun room be replaced. These two repairs could be done by the school authorities as they are actually maintenance jobs.\n\n[Signature]\n\nD. W. Gordon\nAugust 15th, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.

We are authorizing them to proceed with the work recommended in the fifth paragraph of their memorandum.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nOttawa, July 27th, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nRe: Alert Bay Indian Residential School\nYour File L.A. 1756-3\n\nWe are in receipt of your memorandum dated July 19th regarding the roof repairs and waterproofing of the walls at the above school. It is noted that the cost of the work is estimated at $4,400.00, and this amount will be transferred to your Branch when required.\n\nPP/ST Acting Director.\nOttawa, August 18, 1949.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, British Columbia.\n\nFollowing receipt of a memorandum from Mr. T.R.L. MacInnes dated July 27th last, which carried your marginal notation of the 29th ultimo, and which transmitted concurrence by Indian Affairs in operations covered by our memorandum to you of July 15th, 1949, this office requested Mr. Webb of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau in Vancouver, to obtain competitive tenders for carrying out the recommendations included in the report prepared by Mr. Gordon of his office, dated June 16th, 1949, and which he estimated would cost approximately $4,400.00, made up of items as follows:\n\n1. Repairs to Infirmary Sun Room and Concrete Wall in West Basement...........$ 570.00\n2. Repairs to School Roof.....................$ 530.00\n3. Waterproofing exterior brick walls.......$ 3,300.00\n\nEstimated total Cost $4,400.00\n\nMr. Webb in his letter covering the submission of Mr. Gordon's report, recommended that the roofing and waterproofing work be carried out by contract, based on cost plus a percentage and that the repairs to the basement wall and infirmary sun room should be executed by day labour, all under supervision from his staff.\n\nOn the 10th instant however, Mr. Webb sent us an Army Signal, wherein he advised that he considered it advisable to employ an experienced roofing foreman and to execute the roofing repairs by day labour. He proposes however to draw up specifications and a contract agreement from which to obtain tenders for the waterproofing work, to be submitted to this office for approval. No mention is made of repairs to the sun room.\n\nIt is felt that the repairs to the sun room and school roof could very well be executed by day labour at less cost than by a cost plus contract. On the waterproofing work we will expect lump sum tenders.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch is satisfied with this arrangement, but Ministerial approval has not been obtained.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6429, file 875-5, part 12)\nIt would therefore be appreciated if approval could be obtained, allowing us to instruct Mr. Webb to purchase materials and engage labour to the best advantage locally, to execute repairs to the infirmary sun room, and school roof, under his supervision as soon as possible, at a total cost of approximately $1,100.00.\n\nWhen tenders are received for the waterproofing work, we will again request you to obtain Ministerial approval.\n\nChas. H. Buck,\nfor Chief, Engineering and Construction Division.\nAir Mail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to Superintendent Todd's letter of August 13 and requisition attached, the furnishings requested for the Alert Bay Indian Residential School will cost approximately $150.00, f.o.b.

S. Palmer\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Painting Windows, St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nIn his letter which is the subject of our memorandum, of even date, to you regarding waterproofing walls of the above school, Mr. Webb writes as follows:\n\n\"In our memorandum of 16 June 1949 we recommended that painting the window sash be done by the school authorities as it is actually general maintenance. However, it is advisable to have this work done on the south face of the building before the waterproofing mastic is applied for the reasons that absorption through the wood into the brick setting might damage the mastic and also that it is not advisable to sling staging on the walls for about two years after the mastic is applied. It is therefore recommended that arrangements be made with the successful bidder to do the painting. This could be done on the same staging that is used for the waterproofing work and therefore at a very reasonable cost. This cost is not expected to exceed $500.00. Authority for this expenditure is requested.\"\n\nWe recommend that Mr. Arneil arrange to have this item carried out as maintenance under his own authority while the scaffolding is still in place.\n\nChas.

They\nconsider that in handling the work by day labour, less\nexpenditure would be incurred than by cost plus\ncontract.\n\nThe work would be done under the supervision\nof the engineers of the Lands & Development Services\nBranch at Vancouver. I would appreciate it if the\nMinister would approve the expenditure mentioned above.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, August 18, 1949.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, British Columbia.\n\nFollowing receipt of a memorandum from Mr. T.R.L. MacInnes dated July 27th last, which carried your marginal notation of the 29th ultimo, and which transmitted concurrence by Indian Affairs in operations covered by our memorandum to you of July 19th, 1949, this office requested Mr. Webb of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau in Vancouver, to obtain competitive tenders for carrying out the recommendations included in the report prepared by Mr. Gordon of his office, dated June 16th, 1949, and which he estimated would cost approximately $4,400.00, made up of items as follows:\n\n1. Repairs to Infirmary Sun Room and Concrete Wall in West Basement...........$570.00\n2. Repairs to School Roof.....................$530.00\n3. Waterproofing exterior brick walls.......$3,300.00\n\nEstimated total Cost $4,400.00\n\nMr. Webb in his letter covering the submission of Mr. Gordon's report, recommended that the roofing and waterproofing work be carried out by contract, based on cost plus a percentage and that the repairs to the basement wall and infirmary sun room should be executed by day labour, all under supervision from his staff.\n\nOn the 10th instant however, Mr. Webb sent us an Army Signal, wherein he advised that he considered it advisable to employ an experienced roofing foreman and to execute the roofing repairs by day labour. He proposes however to draw up specifications and a contract agreement from which to obtain tenders for the waterproofing work, to be submitted to this office for approval. No mention is made of repairs to the sun room.\n\nIt is felt that the repairs to the sun room and school roof could very well be executed by day labour at less cost than by a cost plus contract. On the waterproofing work we will expect lump sum tenders.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch is satisfied with this arrangement, but Ministerial approval has not been obtained.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6429, file 875-5, part 12)\nIt would therefore be appreciated if approval could be obtained, allowing us to instruct Mr. Webb to purchase materials and engage labour to the best advantage locally, to execute repairs to the infirmary sun room, and school roof, under his supervision as soon as possible, at a total cost of approximately $1,100.00.\n\nWhen tenders are received for the waterproofing work, we will again request you to obtain Ministerial approval.\n\nChas.

Buck,\nfor Chief, Engineering and Construction Division.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Alert Bay Indian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, British Columbia.\n\nSince our memorandum of July 5th last and receipt of Major MacKay's memorandum of July 13th in connection with the above, for your information and transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch, you are advised that the following action has been taken.\n\nPlans and specifications were prepared for revisions to mechanical services at the above building and were forwarded on October 3rd to Indian Commissioner W.S.

A consequent increase of approximately $2,700.00 over our original estimate of $8,500.00, brings the total involved up to approximately $11,200.00. We feel that the above, coupled with recent increases in the cost of materials and labour, as well as the fact that in a lump sum tender, the contractor will protect himself against contingencies, is justification for recommending acceptance of the Mitchell Brothers Limited, tender.\n\nIf approval is received from the Indian Affairs Branch, we will prepare a draft Memorandum to Council asking authority to have this work carried out.\n\nR.A.

Priority has been given to the matter of overhauling the heating system at this school but we have still not been able to secure adequate tenders.\n\nYou will appreciate our position in that we make funds available but that it is simply impossible to guarantee that contractors, especially in B.C. and Alberta, will be interested in accepting jobs at these isolated schools. In fact B.C. has been by far the hardest hit province in so far as completion of projects is concerned. Of three day schools advertised, we were unable to accept any tenders as submitted due to their being so much higher than other provinces. You can inform the Principal of the Alert Bay school accordingly and when the Lands and Development Services Branch are satisfied that a fair tender has been received, you will be advised.\n\nBernard F.

However, it is advisable to have this work done on the south face of the building before the waterproofing mastic is applied for the reasons that absorption through the wood into the brick setting might damage the mastic and also that it is not advisable to sling staging on the walls for about two years after the mastic is applied. It is therefore recommended that arrangements be made with the successful bidder to do the painting. This could be done on the same staging that is used for the waterproofing work and therefore at a very reasonable cost. This cost is not expected to exceed $500.00. Authority for this expenditure is requested.\"\n\nWe recommend that Mr. Arneil arrange to have this item carried out as maintenance under his own authority while the scaffolding is still in place.\n\nChas.

In a discussion with him I was able to learn that little improvement can yet be noted in the classroom work, general discipline and morale of this school.\n\nTherefore I called Canon Cook and General Turner to a meeting in my office to discuss this situation.\n\nThey realize the staff situation is far from satisfactory but advise that it is almost impossible in British Columbia to compete with local industry for general staff and with our Indian day and provincial schools for teaching staff.\n\nI advised Inspector Davey that funds would be made available for the purchase of furniture for the staff quarters and also for paint which can be used to advantage in brightening the teachers' living accommodation.\n\nInspector Davey does not recommend the painting of the interior of the school until discipline has been restored to a much greater extent than at present.\n\nWhile this is primarily a staff problem, the Principal would seem to be at fault in that he had not held a\nsingle staff meeting up to the time of Inspector Davey's visit. He is apparently trying to do too much himself and is even handling some of the classroom work. This leads to the unhappy position of having the Principal tied up in a classroom when he should be supervising the many other activities of the school.\n\nAs you are aware, the contract for the heating repairs will shortly be let and we had just finished waterproofing the outside of the building. In other words, the Department has done its share in restoring this building to proper working shape and the M.S.C.C. has not been able yet to provide the proper staff.\n\nInspector Davey has recommended that either Mr. Caldwell or Mr. Anfield be sent to this school for a period of two weeks or more in order that their experience can be used to advantage in reorganizing the entire staff and working conditions.\n\nI feel that these matters should be brought to your attention as this is the only residential school in British Columbia which is now not functioning in a fairly efficient manner.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 1 DECEMBER 1949\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report dated 24th November, 1949 from the Minister of Mines and Resources, representing:\n\nThat in the 1949-50 estimates of the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, funds were provided for revisions and additions to the Plumbing and Heating Systems at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, British Columbia;\n\nThat tenders were invited through the medium of W.S. Arnell, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, for carrying out this work by contract on the basis of drawings, specifications and other tendering data, prepared by the Department;\n\nThat bona-fide lump sum tenders were received from firms, in the amounts as follows:\n\n| Contractor                        | Amount of Tender |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|\n| Mitchell Brothers Limited         | $13,868.00       |\n| 1980 Burrard Street               |                  |\n| Vancouver, British Columbia       |                  |\n| Barr and Anderson Limited         | $14,572.00       |\n| 1060 Homer Street                 |                  |\n| Vancouver, British Columbia       |                  |\n| Murray Plumbing and Heating Co.,  | $14,623.00       |\n| 1236 Seymour Street               |                  |\n| Vancouver, British Columbia       |                  |\n\nThat the tender submitted by Mitchell Brothers Limited, was investigated and found to be in accordance with drawings and specifications prepared by the Department, and that the said tender was accompanied by a marked cheque drawn in favour of the Receiver General of Canada for ten per cent (10%) of the amount of the tender.\n\nThat this work is of pressing emergency in which delay would be injurious to the public interest.\n\nThe Committee, therefore, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources, advise that authority be granted to accept the tender submitted by Mitchell Brothers Limited, of Vancouver, British Columbia, and to enter into an agreement with the said firm for the revisions and additions to the Plumbing and Heating Systems at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, at Alert Bay, British Columbia, at their tendered price of $13,868.00, funds for which have been provided in the estimates of the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, for Indian Agencies.\n\n(Sgd.)

National Topographical Series, Scale\n8 miles to 1 inch.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe most recent report by Mr. Gordon dated 16 June\n1949, provides pertinent information as to the location of\nSt. Michael's Indian Residential School, its structural\ncharacteristics, and defects in the structure causing moisture\npenetration through the exterior walls.\n\nThe defects causing moisture to leak into the\ninterior of the building were noted as follows:\n\n(1) Basement - Moisture penetration through a crack in\nthe concrete at the north wall of the west basement.\n\n(2) Infirmary Sunroom - Moisture leaking to this room\nevidently resulted from settling of the brick column supports.\nThese supports had settled until the roof sloped away from its\ndrain and the top west side of the roof had been separated from the main outside wall of the school by some three-quarters of an inch.\n\n(3) Roof Flashing - On the roof, at the south face of the main building where the roof sheeting met the parapet wall, it did not lap up under the flashing. Seepage of water was reported on the floor and basement below the section.\n\n(4) Residence - Two leaks were reported at the residence during the winter 1948-49. One of these leaks was over the doorway between the residence and the school and the other was in the ceiling of the residence bathroom located on the second floor. It was considered that the water was entering through narrow localized holes or cracks and not through large areas of walls of roof as these appear in good condition.\n\n(5) Caulking Around Windows - The caulking around the windows on the south side of the school was in poor condition and required replacement. It was not considered that moisture was seeping into the building around these window openings. Nevertheless, to ensure a good job of waterproofing the walls, it was deemed necessary to replace the existing caulking with fresh compound.\n\nRepairs Made\n\nThe repairs completed and the methods employed were, with minor exceptions, those recommended. The repair of the crack in the basement wall was undertaken by the school authorities before other work of repair was started. The crack was filled with a cement and sand mortar without a waterproofing admixture.\n\nThe repair to the sunroom and the roof of the school was conducted under Mr. Gordon's direction with the use of hired labour. Undermining the brick column footings, intended in the sunroom repair, was too difficult and the alternate method shown in the attached plan was employed. The footing\ndimension was increased to 4'-1\" x 4'-1\" and the new concrete was bonded to the existing footing by five, three-quarter inch diameter, dowels, twelve inches long. These dowels were imbedded for an equal length in the old and the new concrete. Patching of the stucco finish to the sunroom was also done at the time. This patching required only a small outlay in time and material and therefore the work was done to preserve the appearance of the building and to prevent further spalling of the stucco finish.\n\nAlso completed under Mr. Gordon's direction, with the aid of a qualified roofer, was the repair to the roof flashing. The work was done as recommended, with the minor exceptions that; (a) hot application of asphalt was used to mop on the felt rather than using the cold application initially considered, (b) sixteen ounce copper sheeting was used in place of the twenty ounce originally intended. With the lighter gauge copper, \"drivins\" were used to fasten the sheeting to the back of the parapet wall. The method of repairing the roof is indicated in figure 3 on the attached plan.\n\nThe cost of repairs to the sunroom columns supports and the roof flashing was $985.39. A detail of this estimate is attached.\n\nThe waterproofing of the south wall of the school was done under contract by the firm of J. T. Devlin and Company of Vancouver. Tremco Manufacturing Company products were used. The treatment consisted of sealing the masonry surface with \"Tremco 101 Primer\" and then applying a coating of \"Tremco 101 Mastic Waterproofing\". Both primer and mastic were applied with spray gun. Two coatings, and in most areas three coatings of the primer, were applied. The actual rate of application averaged one gallon per 100 square feet. The rate of application of the mastic treatment was 4\u00bd gallons per 100 square feet.\nThe colour of the mastic is dark red over the entire wall surface; copings and sills are treated with a natural cement coloured mastic to contrast, and the whole presents a pleasing appearance.\n\nAlthough not included in the contract agreement, the infirmary sunroom was also treated, at no extra cost, in the same way as the main wall to which it adjoins. This was done to ensure a pleasing appearance to the front elevation of the building.\n\nAll copings, sills, parapet walls, flashings and stone work on the south exterior wall of the school were caulked before the waterproofing treatment was applied. A copy of the technical provision included in the contract agreement is attached as Appendix III.\n\nThe cost of the work completed under the agreement was $3,052.00. All work was done to the complete satisfaction of Mr. D. P. Hunter, of this office, who conducted all inspections in connection with the J. T. Devlin and Company Contract. The small area on the east wall of the school noted in Mr. Gordon's memorandum was not included in the Devlin & Company contract. No treatment of any type was given to the east wall at this time. Conclusive evidence of moisture penetration through the surface was lacking. Should seepage through this wall section occur, it would be advisable in the interest of appearance of the school, to treat with the identical \"Minwax\" product used by Mr. W. C. Warren on the remainder of this east wall. Particulars of this treatment are given in this engineer's report of 21 July 1937.\n\nAn additional contract, that of painting and glazing sash and windows on the south face of the school, was awarded to J. T. Devlin and Company. No transfer of funds was made to the Engineering and Construction Division for the work. The contract was arranged directly between Indian Affairs Branch and the contractor. The necessary specifications were prepared.\nIn this office and a copy of these is attached as Appendix IV. The inspection of the work, as in the instance of waterproofing was done by Mr. D. P. Hunter.\n\nOriginally it was suggested that this work could be done by the school authorities as it was actually a maintenance task. However, the painting and glazing was not done at the time the waterproofing contract was started. It was therefore arranged to have the contractor do the work. The amount of the contract was $410.00. This contract was satisfactorily completed. The principal reason for insisting that the sash be painted at this time was the fact that the mastic waterproofing used is characteristically soft or pliable from one to three years after application. For this reason it is advantageous to ensure ladders or scaffolding are not placed against the treated walls for the first few years, as such procedure would damage the mastic finish and permit moisture to enter through the wall of the building.\n\nCost\n\nThe cost of the completed work outlined above was $4,447.39. A detail of this cost is attached as Appendix I.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe repairs to this building recommended in Mr. Gordon's memorandum of 16 June 1949 have been completed in an acceptable manner. The weather during the waterproofing operation was satisfactory. When the primer was applied, the weather was particularly good and better than average conditions for this type of work were encountered. This ensured that the walls were dry before sealing with the primary treatment. Some rain fell before the mastic application was complete. This was not serious because the walls were then impervious to moisture by reason of the priming treatment. No mastic, of course, was applied during the rain.\nNo further trouble with moisture penetration is expected through the exterior south wall of the school. It is expected that moisture will be experienced on the interior walls of the residence. The residence is a two-storey structure attached to the east wing of the main building. The source of entry of the moisture reported on the wall of this building could not be definitely determined and therefore no recommendation to rectify the trouble could be made.\n\nThe appearance of the school has benefitted by the work done. Appendix II, figures 1, 2, and 3, show the pleasing elevation of the front of the school after the waterproofing treatment. Other photographs in the Appendix show the marked improvements effected by the waterproofing, glazing and other repairs.\n\nFurther work could be done to advantage on the exterior of the remainder of the school, particularly on the copings and sashes. No estimate was made on the cost of restoration work necessary. However, it is respectfully suggested that this building be thoroughly examined in the near future and a comprehensive schedule of maintenance and repair work necessary be outlined for execution.\n\nAttached are the following Appendices:\n\nAppendix I - Cost of Work\n\nII - Photographs relative to south exterior wall of St. Michael's Residential School\n\nIII - Technical Provisions applicable to Waterproofing Contract.\n\nIV - Technical provisions applicable to Painting and Glazing Contract.\n\nV - Plan indicating repairs done to wall, roof, and sunroom.\n\nIndian Affairs.

National Topographical Series, Scale\n8 miles to 1 inch.\n\nGeneral\n\nThe most recent report by Mr. Gordon dated 16 June\n1949, provides pertinent information as to the location of\nSt. Michael's Indian Residential School, its structural\ncharacteristics, and defects in the structure causing moisture\npenetration through the exterior walls.\n\nThe defects causing moisture to leak into the\ninterior of the building were noted as follows:\n\n(1) Basement - Moisture penetration through a crack in\nthe concrete at the north wall of the west basement.\n\n(2) Infirmary Sunroom - Moisture leaking to this room\nevidently resulted from settling of the brick column supports.\nThese supports had settled until the roof sloped away from its\ndrain and the top west side of the roof had been separated from the main outside wall of the school by some three-quarters of an inch.\n\n(3) Roof Flashing - On the roof, at the south face of the main building where the roof sheeting met the parapet wall, it did not lap up under the flashing. Seepage of water was reported on the floor and basement below the section.\n\n(4) Residence - Two leaks were reported at the residence during the winter 1948-49. One of these leaks was over the doorway between the residence and the school and the other was in the ceiling of the residence bathroom located on the second floor. It was considered that the water was entering through narrow localized holes or cracks and not through large areas of walls or roof as these appear in good condition.\n\n(5) Caulking Around Windows - The caulking around the windows on the south side of the school was in poor condition and required replacement. It was not considered that moisture was seeping into the building around these window openings. Nevertheless, to ensure a good job of waterproofing the walls, it was deemed necessary to replace the existing caulking with fresh compound.\n\nRepairs Made\n\nThe repairs completed and the methods employed were, with minor exceptions, those recommended. The repair of the crack in the basement wall was undertaken by the school authorities before other work of repair was started. The crack was filled with a cement and sand mortar without a waterproofing admixture.\n\nThe repair to the sunroom and the roof of the school was conducted under Mr. Gordon's direction with the use of hired labour. Undermining the brick column footings, intended in the sunroom repair, was too difficult and the alternate method shown in the attached plan was employed. The footing\ndimension was increased to 4'-1\" x 4'-1\" and the new concrete was bonded to the existing footing by five, three-quarter inch diameter, dowels, twelve inches long. These dowels were imbedded for an equal length in the old and the new concrete. Patching of the stucco finish to the sunroom was also done at the time. This patching required only a small outlay in time and material and therefore the work was done to preserve the appearance of the building and to prevent further spalling of the stucco finish.\n\nAlso completed under Mr. Gordon's direction, with the aid of a qualified roofer, was the repair to the roof flashing. The work was done as recommended, with the minor exceptions that; (a) hot application of asphalt was used to mop on the felt rather than using the cold application initially considered, (b) sixteen ounce copper sheeting was used in place of the twenty ounce originally intended. With the lighter gauge copper, \"drivins\" were used to fasten the sheeting to the back of the parapet wall. The method of repairing the roof is indicated in figure 3 on the attached plan.\n\nThe cost of repairs to the sunroom columns supports and the roof flashing was $985.39. A detail of this estimate is attached.\n\nThe waterproofing of the south wall of the school was done under contract by the firm of J. T. Devlin and Company of Vancouver. Tremco Manufacturing Company products were used. The treatment consisted of sealing the masonry surface with \"Tremco 101 Primer\" and then applying a coating of \"Tremco 101 Mastic Waterproofing\". Both primer and mastic were applied with spray gun. Two coatings, and in most areas three coatings of the primer, were applied. The actual rate of application averaged one gallon per 100 square feet. The rate of application of the mastic treatment was 4\u00bd gallons per 100 square feet.\nThe colour of the mastic is dark red over the entire wall surface; copings and sills are treated with a natural cement coloured mastic to contrast, and the whole presents a pleasing appearance.\n\nAlthough not included in the contract agreement, the infirmary sunroom was also treated, at no extra cost, in the same way as the main wall to which it adjoins. This was done to ensure a pleasing appearance to the front elevation of the building.\n\nAll copings, sills, parapet walls, flashings and stone work on the south exterior wall of the school were caulked before the waterproofing treatment was applied. A copy of the technical provision included in the contract agreement is attached as Appendix III.\n\nThe cost of the work completed under the agreement was $3,052.00. All work was done to the complete satisfaction of Mr. D. P. Hunter, of this office, who conducted all inspections in connection with the J. T. Devlin and Company Contract. The small area on the east wall of the school noted in Mr. Gordon's memorandum was not included in the Devlin & Company contract. No treatment of any type was given to the east wall at this time. Conclusive evidence of moisture penetration through the surface was lacking. Should seepage through this wall section occur, it would be advisable in the interest of appearance of the school, to treat with the identical \"Minwax\" product used by Mr. W. C. Warren on the remainder of this east wall. Particulars of this treatment are given in this engineer's report of 21 July 1937.\n\nAn additional contract, that of painting and glazing sash and windows on the south face of the school, was awarded to J. T. Devlin and Company. No transfer of funds was made to the Engineering and Construction Division for the work. The contract was arranged directly between Indian Affairs Branch and the contractor. The necessary specifications were prepared.\nin this office and a copy of these is attached as Appendix IV. The inspection of the work, as in the instance of waterproofing was done by Mr. D. P. Hunter.\n\nOriginally it was suggested that this work could be done by the school authorities as it was actually a maintenance task. However, the painting and glazing was not done at the time the waterproofing contract was started. It was therefore arranged to have the contractor do the work. The amount of the contract was $410.00. This contract was satisfactorily completed. The principal reason for insisting that the sash be painted at this time was the fact that the mastic waterproofing used is characteristically soft or pliable from one to three years after application. For this reason it is advantageous to ensure ladders or scaffolding are not placed against the treated walls for the first few years, as such procedure would damage the mastic finish and permit moisture to enter through the wall of the building.\n\nCost\n\nThe cost of the completed work outlined above was $4,447.39. A detail of this cost is attached as Appendix I.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe repairs to this building recommended in Mr. Gordon's memorandum of 16 June 1949 have been completed in an acceptable manner. The weather during the waterproofing operation was satisfactory. When the primer was applied, the weather was particularly good and better than average conditions for this type of work were encountered. This ensured that the walls were dry before sealing with the primary treatment. Some rain fell before the mastic application was complete. This was not serious because the walls were then impervious to moisture by reason of the priming treatment. No mastic, of course, was applied during the rain.\nNo further trouble with moisture penetration is expected through the exterior south wall of the school. It is expected that moisture will be experienced on the interior walls of the residence. The residence is a two-storey structure attached to the east wing of the main building. The source of entry of the moisture reported on the wall of this building could not be definitely determined and therefore no recommendation to rectify the trouble could be made.\n\nThe appearance of the school has benefitted by the work done. Appendix II, figures 1, 2, and 3, show the pleasing elevation of the front of the school after the waterproofing treatment. Other photographs in the Appendix show the marked improvements effected by the waterproofing, glazing and other repairs.\n\nFurther work could be done to advantage on the exterior of the remainder of the school, particularly on the copings and sashes. No estimate was made on the cost of restoration work necessary. However, it is respectfully suggested that this building be thoroughly examined in the near future and a comprehensive schedule of maintenance and repair work necessary be outlined for execution.\n\nAttached are the following Appendices:\n\nAppendix I - Cost of Work\nII - Photographs relative to south exterior wall of St. Michael's Residential School\nIII - Technical Provisions applicable to Waterproofing Contract.\nIV - Technical provisions applicable to Painting and Glazing Contract.\nV - Plan indicating repairs done to wall, roof, and sunroom.\n\n[Signature]\n\nNorman P.

S. C. C. has recently returned from an inspection visit to the above school. On his return he discussed with the Superintendent of Education the possibility of converting the heating system at the above school from wood to oil. He advises that it is now almost impossible to obtain an adequate supply of cordwood at Alert Bay. Practically the entire village has converted to fuel oil and the Principal of the School has strongly recommended this conversion. Canon Cook has quoted from a letter received from Principal Allsopp as follows:\n\n\"Since you left Alert Bay I have done a little more investigating into the matter of oil fuel for our heating plant.\n\n\"During the severe cold weather I estimate that it has cost us approximately $20.00 per day for slab wood fuel, this does not take into consideration the wastage of man hours and fuel in handling; apart from cost and effort, at no time has the school been at least comfortably warm.\n\nIn -\n\"In talking the matter over with Mitchell Bros. Engineer he was of the opinion that during the winter season it ought to be possible to adequately heat the school with a daily gallonage of diesel fuel not in excess of 80 gals. daily (twenty-four hours) if his estimate is correct this would prove more economical than using slab wood. The present price of diesel fuel is 15.2\u00a2 per gal. and there is every possibility that by next Fall there will be the convenience of tank truck delivery at a cost of 1\u00a2 a gallon.\n\n\"Another point to consider is that the new hot water system will be cut in to the low pressure boiler which will necessitate the maintaining of a light fire during the summer months.\"\n\nIn view of the heating repairs now being done at the above school under your direction, it would be appreciated if we could have your comments as to the advisability of converting to oil and also as to the probable cost of this conversion.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nColonel B.

I thought the following from a letter of Principal Allsopp might prove of interest:\n\n\"Since you left Alert Bay I have done a little more investigating into the matter of oil fuel for our heating plant.\n\nDuring the severe cold weather I estimate that it has cost us approximately $20.00 per day for slab wood fuel, this does not take into consideration the wastage of man hours and fuel in handling, apart from cost and effort, at no time has the school been at least comfortably warm.\n\nIn talking the matter over with Mitchel Bros.

Your File I.A.1756-2\n\nCanon Cook, Superintendent of the M.S.C.C., has recently visited the above school, and he states that the main smoke stack requires cleaning out. He further advises us that there is no clean-out at the base of the stack.\n\nAs Mitchell Brothers are now employed at the school carrying out work already authorized, it was thought that you might arrange with them to provide a clean-out. Please give this matter your early attention.\n\nFP/ST Director.\nColonel B. F.

The pump and engine mentioned have caused much trouble of late as well as considerable expense to the Administration.\n\nIt would be appreciated if action on Mr. Allsopp's request/have early attention.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nFebruary 3, 1950.\n\nThe Indian Superintendent,\nAlert Bay Indian Agency,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Petters Atomic Diesel Engine, Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nThe above engine which provides power for the Pomona pump supplying domestic water for this school, is again giving considerable trouble, and has been constantly breaking down over the past six months.\n\nDue to the fact that we not only depend upon this engine for our very day supply of water but also for fire protection it is imperative that consideration be given to assure adequate and reliable pumping facilities.\n\nThe present condition of the engine has demanded so much time and attention from our engineer that it has been impossible for him to give sufficient time to the maintaining of other installations at a normal standard of efficiency.\n\nNot only has there been far too much time taken up by our engineer in endeavouring to keep the engine operating, the Indian School Administration have been called upon to pay heavy repair bills in securing the services of local mechanics.\n\nI would refer you to our letter of February 5th, 1948, (copy attached) concerning this engine. It is apparent that the time has come for further consideration being given to the installation of an electric motor which would give reliable service assuring an adequate water supply at all times. This was suggested on Departmental Estimates submitted for the year 1949 - 1950.\n\nYour consideration of this matter will be appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPrincipal.\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you know, the domestic water pump and engine have been giving us a great deal of trouble. On looking over the files in this office I find that the engine is a Petters Atomic Diesel 7 H.P. purchased and installed in May 1934. This engine is no longer reliable as many parts are badly worn. In October 1947 the Vancouver Agents for this engine stated that the engine is now a very old model and that parts are practically unobtainable from England as the manufacture of this model has been discontinued. Requests for a new engine or an electric motor were sent to the Indian Agent in October 1938, July 10th, 1941, and May 17th, 1943.\n\nThe domestic pump is a Pomona installed in August 1929. The pump was last pulled in 1941 and new impeller blades were installed. In July 1945 the pump behaved in a spasmodic manner. The Agents for the pump suggested resetting the impellers and this was done. On December 23rd, 1947 the pump jammed. We called in the same mechanic who pulled the pump in 1941, and he suggested that one of the sections may have broken and dropped off. It was impossible to undertake a complete overhaul at that time, so he freed the pump and it has operated since, but at a considerable reduced output. Spare parts have been ordered but they will have to be specially made at the factory.\n\nIt is obvious that both the pump and engine have given good service and that both should be replaced.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) B.O.G.

As you are aware, general mechanical revisions are now being carried out at the above institution by Mitchell Brothers Limited of Vancouver.\n\nShould the Indian Affairs Branch approve of the proposed conversion to oil firing along the lines outlined below, the Contractor would be requested to submit a price, which if found to be fair and just, would be the basis on which an extra work order covering these operations could be prepared.\n\nWe have first hand knowledge that the slab wood used for fuel in this school is of very poor quality and since it is now reported that wood is increasingly difficult to obtain, it is felt that consideration should be given to the use of oil in one boiler.\n\nThe building is served by two low pressure steam steel fire box boilers, each rated at 44 H.P. One boiler oil fired, would handle the entire load including the heating of domestic hot water except under the most adverse weather conditions. Under such conditions the second boiler could be cut in to service.\n\nIt is felt that the second boiler should be kept as a standby and either fired by wood or coal. This would preclude the possibility of a total shut-down in case of electric current failure.\n\nBased on the most up-to-date method of estimating fuel consumption and assuming a 200 day heating season, 80% efficiency of combustion with oil firing using No. 2 light diesel oil, 23,036 gallons of oil would be required, which is an average of 115 gallons per day. If the Principal's figure of 15.2\u00a2 per gallon plus 1\u00a2 for delivery is correct for that area, this would amount to $18.63 per day, which is under the price now being paid for slab wood.\n\nIt must be clearly understood that the above data is based on the use of light oil No. 2 or 3 so-called diesel fuel oil. Since the school electrical system is served by a generating set it would not be possible to use crude oils requiring electric preheaters as the electrical equipment is not large enough to handle additional loads which would be imposed.\nGreat care should be exercised in the selection of an oil burner for this school, which is remotely located from Vancouver or any other industrial centre. A burner designed embodying the most up-to-date, fool proof and trouble free operation should be selected, as it may be difficult to obtain skilled service in case of mechanical failure. Such a burner is available locally, and its characteristics have been thoroughly checked. If approval is given to this work, it is strongly recommended that the Indian Affairs Branch purchase the burner upon advice which will be given to them at a later date. However auxiliary items including the oil storage tank, controls, refractory lining in the combustion chamber together with piping and other incidental accessories could be supplied by the Contractor.\n\nIt is roughly estimated that this work could be carried out for $2,600.00. We therefore request that the Indian Affairs Branch advise us of their decision in this matter.\n\nChief.\nMr. W.S.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Alert Bay Indian Residential School. Your File 156-6-1-375\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, I enclose for your information a copy of a memorandum received from the Department of Resources and Development, with regard to the proposed conversion to oil firing at the above school.\n\nThe Director was under the impression that it might be preferable to convert to coal. However, we have received a memorandum from the M.S.C.C., from which it appears that they have already considered this matter, and state that the cost of coal would be $10.00 a ton laid down at the wharf plus an additional charge of $2.00 a ton for cartage to the school. In addition to this, there is the extra work of shovelling the coal into the storage bin.\n\nWe would appreciate having your comments on the enclosed memorandum as soon as possible, and at that time you might also let us know your opinion on the relative values of coal or oil.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nExtracts from reports of Principal, St. Michael's School, Alert Bay, regarding use of coal for heating.\n\n(a) Letter dated 26th September, 1949.\n\n\"The idea of the stoker and use of stoker coal is naturally attractive but I feel that care should be taken to see that it is going to be possible to import coal economically. If it can be brought in by the scow load, there will, of course, be considerable saving. Hauling of the coal must also be considered. Under present conditions, coal must be put on the wharf, shovelled into the truck, again dumped outside the school boiler room and finally shovelled into the coal bin. With such operations, I believe there is at least a half ton loss with every fifty tons delivered. To handle a scow load, some type of portable loader would be an essential requirement. There is not a suitable building on the school property to enable storage of a full winter's supply of coal. To avoid waste, a lean-to shed adjacent to the boiler room would be most feasible.\n\nAs you suggest, I will discuss with Mr. Todd the idea of a joint purchase of coal.\"\n\n(b) Letter dated 19th October, 1949.\n\n\"In further reference to our correspondence relating to purchase of coal for heating purposes at this school, I have now had an opportunity of discussing this matter with Mr. Todd who informed me that all Indian Department heating units here have been converted to oil burners (with the Day School being in process of conversion). This method of heating seems to be general throughout the town. The new hospital furnaces are the oil burning type.\n\nAs I have pointed out in a previous letter, importation of coal is an expensive matter. Delivered in bulk by freighter, it costs at present $10.00 per ton laid down on the wharf and $2.00 per ton haulage to the school, then we have the extra work of shovelling the coal into our storage bin. There is naturally an unavoidable loss of weight with so much handling.\n\nIt would certainly be a great asset to have the convenience of automatic firing with thermostatic control, but it is evident that there is little hope of us sharing in a pool coal delivery system with the majority of homes and business firms of Alert Bay using fuel oil almost exclusively.\"\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Alert Bay Residential School\n\nFurther to my letter of February 22nd regarding the proposed conversion of the heating system at the above-mentioned school from wood to oil, I am enclosing for your information a letter dated February 21st from Mitchell Brothers Ltd., which confirms our views with regard to the unsuitability of the wood fuel presently being used. I think it is apparent that steps will have to be taken before next winter to convert this heating system to oil.\n\nW. S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\n(Department of Indian Affairs)\n418 Federal Building,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nAttention: Mr. W. Webster\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe: St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nThe writer has just returned from an inspection trip re the steamfitting and plumbing work that this firm is doing under contract to the Department of Indian Affairs re the above School.\n\nThe Boiler installation, Condensate Pump, Drip lines, Covering etc., are completed. We were not able to obtain sufficient steam pressure on the system with either one or two boilers being fired to get a comprehensive test over the whole building with special regard to the production of heat, which no doubt the system was revised for. The School authorities are at present firing both boilers with slab cordwood in four and five foot lengths, which is soaking wet and of very poor quality, and the b.t.u. output from which is extremely low. It is the only available fuel, and will never gain sufficient output at the boiler to heat this building, especially since the lines are now trapped and not of sufficient pressure to lift the indicator off the pin, so the steam pressure gauges cannot be raised at any time except by shutting the main steam valves for a test on the installation work, at which time we raised sufficient pressure to give the immediate pipe a sound test.\n\nDuring my visit I inspected the Combustion Chambers of both boilers, and found that the combustion chambers at No.1 and No.2 boilers were filled with cordwood with full draft, and that the cordwood reached to approximately fourteen to sixteen inches from the crown sheet, and that very little flame was even licking the crown sheet. After three hours, approximately, a full draft, the Condensate pump functioned twice for very short periods only. Only those Rads in the Boiler-room's immediate vicinity get warm, and at no time did the pressure gauge ever register pounds of steam.\n\nMy humble opinion, until some means of Automatic firing is installed, this system will never heat properly - for your\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\ninformation please.\n\nI am,\nYours very truly,\nMITCHELL BROTHERS, LTD.\n\nper\n(D.M. Goldie)\nMEMORANDUM TO MR. PHELAN\n\nProposed Conversion to Oil Firing\nAlert Bay Indian Residential School\n\nThe Director phoned me about this letter concerning conversion to oil firing at the Alert Bay Residential School. He is a little worried over the conversion to oil and feels we might check into the possible conversion to coal. You might discuss this with Canon Cook and then write to Mr. Arneil enclosing a copy of Mr. Gibson's letter.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMarch 24, 1950\n\nColonel B.F.

The \"accounts\" to which the Principal refers were from the Alert Bay Shipyard for repair work on the Petters Atomic Diesel and the water pump - repairs requiring tools and machining for which the school workshop is not equipped. The amount approximated nearly $200. For years past this pumping equipment has been costing considerable to maintain - not only in replacement parts but in time spent in babysitting the equipment along.\n\nThe other day you informed me that you had written Mr. Todd about the pump and that you would send a \"follow-up\" asking him to hurry a reply to your queries.\n\nWhat is of concern to me however is the added expense to which the school will be put if a motor is installed. Mr. Allsopp estimates $60 monthly. That is an expensive outlay for water per month. At one time we estimated our present cost at about $20.00.\n\nSince the school gave up generating its own electric current and tapped on to the B.C. System our costs for electrical current have increased nearly three times.\n\nCould these facts please be taken into consideration when you review the question after receipt of Mr. Todd's letter?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent\nSt. Michael's School  \nAlert Bay, B.C.  \nMarch 20, 1950\n\nRev. Canon H.G. Cook  \nIndian School Administration  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Canon:\n\nRe: Petters Diesel Accounts\n\nIn acknowledgement of your letter of March 17th.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter; under the circumstances I thought it better to refer the accounts to you before final settlement was made.\n\nThe engine is again giving trouble and a new set of piston rings will have to be installed before we can get it operating again. While the engineer will be able to do much of the preliminary work it will be necessary for the Alert Bay Shipyards mechanic to take care of the fitting of the rings and the lining up of the engine for restarting. I have told the engineer that he must do as much as he possible can so that labour charges will be kept to the minimum.\n\nIn view of your statement in the last paragraph of your letter I wonder if there is any possibility of asking the Department engineers to consider the installation of a Lister engine rather than an electric motor. This is strongly recommended by the Alert Bay Shipyards Mechanic. He states that the Lister is far more satisfactory than the Petter's and would be easy on maintenance costs and very economical to operate. I understand that it will cost somewhere in the neighbourhood of $50.00 - $60.00 per month for electrical energy to operate a motor powerful enough to run our Pomona pump.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.)

I think the point raised by Mr. Robinson with regard to the future servicing of such installation should be carefully considered and as a matter of fact I am inclined to agree with him that we will get a maximum of service in the future if the contractor who makes the installation provides a burner to our specifications.\n\nSince writing the attached memorandum Mr. Robinson has secured additional information with regard to the relative costs of coal and oil and it is apparent that if we could\nsecure coal at the price mentioned by the Principal it would be far more economical than oil, but enquiries have failed to reveal any source of supply of coal at $10.00 a ton. The best price secured so far on the supply of coal with a rating of 12,000 B.T.U.s per pound is $15.50 per ton landed on the dock at Alert Bay, in 100 ton quantities, plus $1.50 a ton cartage to the school. A comparison of costs based on the B.T.U. rating of coal and the B.T.U. rating of diesel oil indicates that oil will cost approximately one-third more than coal but the cost of the coal does not include the cost of handling the coal at the school and as a matter of fact I doubt very much whether there are facilities in Alert Bay for handling coal in 100 ton lots.\n\nWe will investigate the matter further should you so desire but personally I am of the opinion that the information above warrants the installation of oil burning equipment.\n\nExtra copies of this letter and Mr. Robinson's report are attached for the information of Mr. Weir.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nApril 4, 1950\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Arneil:\n\nRe: Hastings - Alert Bay Residential School\n\nThis will acknowledge your request of 17 March to review Mr. Weir's memorandum to our Director dealing with conversion to oil firing at the above mentioned school.\n\nThere is no question of the need to change to some fuel other than the slash wood as used at present. Mr. Weir's suggestion to convert one boiler to oil is a good one; the other boiler to be used as a standby which would preclude the possibility of a total shutdown in case of electric current failure. Unless there is an assured supply of dry cordwood available for standby use, coal is recommended. The assumption that one boiler, oil fired, could handle the entire load except under adverse weather conditions is correct.\n\nThe estimate of fuel consumption and cost of operation appears to be reasonable, providing that the boiler setting is tight and free from leakage and the furnace draft adequate.\n\nFrom the information presently at hand, it would seem that in the Alert Bay area oil fuel would be restricted to the light grades, that is, No. 2 or No. 3. The use of No. 5 or 6 oils does not appear practical at this institution.\n\nThe suggestion that great care should be exercised in the selection of an oil burner for this school is well taken. However, it would be more advantageous to obtain the necessary burner locally rather than follow the suggestion that the equipment be shipped. It is preferable in cases of this nature to have a reliable local contractor tender for the specified burner and installation. In this way quick, efficient, and reasonable servicing and repair is assured.\n\nIf the Engineering & Construction Service would provide the specifications for a suitable burner, these would serve as a guide in obtaining the desired type of equipment.\n\nIt is noted in Mr. Philo Phelan's letter of March 9 that coal may be obtained laid down at the school for the price of $12.00 per ton. Assuming this to be a medium grade bituminous coal, considerable saving in fuel costs would be obtainable with coal firing. However, the cost of $12.00 a ton appears low and before concluding that coal might be less expensive than oil, further enquiry should be made as to the price of this fuel laid down at the school.\n\nIf required, this matter may be investigated thoroughly by your engineering staff in the course of the next few weeks.\n\nNorman P.

Mr. Weir's suggestion to convert one boiler to oil is a good one; the other boiler to be used as a standby which would preclude the possibility of a total shutdown in case of electric current failure. Unless there is an assured supply of dry cordwood available for standby use, coal is recommended. The assumption that one boiler, oil fired, would handle the entire load except under adverse weather conditions is correct.\n\nThe estimate of fuel consumption and cost of operation appears to be reasonable, providing that the boiler setting is tight and free from leakage and the furnace draft adequate.\n\nFrom the information presently at hand, it would seem that in the Alert Bay area oil fuel would be restricted to the light grades, that is, No. 2 or No. 3. The use of No. 5 or 6 oils does not appear practical at this institution.\n\nThe suggestion that great care should be exercised in the selection of an oil burner for this school is well taken. However, it would be more advantageous to obtain the necessary burner locally rather than follow the suggestion that the equipment be supplied. It is preferable in cases of this nature to have a reliable local contractor tender for the specified burner and installation. In this way quick, efficient, and reasonable servicing and repair is assured.\n\nIf the Engineering & Construction Service would provide the specifications for a suitable burner, these would serve as a guide in obtaining the desired type of equipment.\n\nIt is noted in Mr. Phillip Phelon's letter of March 9 that coal may be obtained laid down at the school for the price of $12.00 per ton. Assuming this to be a medium grade bituminous coal, considerable saving in fuel costs would be obtainable with coal firing. However,\nW. S. Arneil, Esq. (2) April 4, 1950\n\nthe cost at $12.00 a ton appears low and before concluding that coal might be less expensive than oil, further enquiry should be made as to the price of this fuel laid down at the school.\n\nIf required, this matter may be investigated thoroughly by your engineering staff in the course of the next few weeks.\n\nNorman P. Robinson\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nREFERENCE YOUR LETTER MAY 5 REGARDING HEATING ALERT BAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.

It is pointed out, however, that coal would not appear to be practical because there are no off-loading facilities and no storage facilities for large quantities on the wharf. The price of $17.00 per ton is based on delivery in 100-ton lots and delivery of lesser amounts would cost considerably more per ton.\n\nW.S. Arnell,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMemorandum to Mr. Arneil:\n\nRe: Heating - Alert Bay Residential School\n\nThis will acknowledge your memorandum of 17 March requesting that consideration be given to a tender and specification from Mitchell Brothers Limited on the installation of oil burning equipment in one of the low pressure boilers at the above mentioned school.\n\nIn the main, the specifications cover the requirements at the above school. However, it is suggested that an oil burner capable of consuming 16 to 20 Imperial gallons of fuel oil per hour should be installed. The components of the burner as outlined by Mitchell Brothers are acceptable. The controls required are as follows:\n\n(1) A re-cycle control to protect in the event of power or flame failure and to withhold restarting of the burner until a suitable scavenging period has elapsed. This control to include a delayed action oil valve opening feature to ensure the burner will come to full operating speed before fuel oil is fed to the furnace.\n\n(2) A high-low limit pressure control should be connected to the re-cycle control circuit to stop and start the oil burner.\n\n(3) Low water cut-off should be wired into the oil burning circuit so as to prevent the burner from operating in the event of low water levels in the boiler. If these are of the float type, it should be equipped with blow-down valve and piping to facilitate removal of sediment from the float chamber.\n\n(4) An automatic draft regulator should be installed to ensure that draft in the combustion chamber is reduced to a level consistent with the proper disposal of the gases of combustion.\n(5) One high limit control valve.\n\nRoom thermostats are not considered advisable in this institution. Manual operation of the radiator valves in the various rooms is considered adequate for an institution of this type.\n\nThe size of the oil storage tank should not exceed 3,000 gallons. Oil delivery is obtainable at Alert Bay by tank truck with a capacity of 500 gallons. The current price of this type of delivery which could be obtained under, say, annual contract, is about 15.2\u00a2 per gallon.\n\nIn deciding the correct size of fuel storage tank, consideration must be given to the fact that there is possibly only one truck available in the community for delivering fuel oil and, too, the limited number of motor vehicles and the isolated nature of Alert Bay would suggest that in the selection of a storage tank the choice should be made for a larger tank than might otherwise be considered adequate.\n\nIt is suggested that a 3,000 gallon tank be obtained. This tank should be buried underground in accordance with the regulations set out for the Province of British Columbia governing such devices. Possibly allowance should be made for constructing a pit under the boiler to provide a combustion chamber of about 44 cubic feet as recommended by the oil burner manufacturer.\n\nThe side walls of the boiler furnace box, target wall, and the furnace box floor would have to be rebricked and properly insulated.\n\nThe cost of such an installation would be approximately $4,000.00. However, competitive bids based on a firm specification might better this estimate. With an annual consumption of 2,336 gallons of oil as noted in Mr. Weir's memorandum to our Director of the 22nd February, fuel oil would cost $3,500.00 a year, whereas coal, if obtainable at $17.00 per ton which appears to be the best price to date, would cost possibly $900.00 less. However, coal does not seem practical at Alert Bay because of the lack of off-loading facilities and storage on the wharf.\n\nIf it is decided to install one oil burner at Alert Bay, definite specifications could be drawn up and tender prices received from reliable local firms.\n\nNorman F.

This account represents ordinary operation of the diesel water pump. I phoned Mr. Allsopp and he advised me they had difficulty in starting the engine and Alert Bay Shipyards were called in several times to do work which in the past would have been taken care of by the school engineer.\n\nThe Department knows we have spent considerable money on this domestic water system. The account in question was authorized by the principal and I am somewhat surprised that he should be paid by the school paying for same when it was agreed by both of us prior to the account being submitted, that it was a responsibility of the school.\n\nIt is quite true this Petter Engine now used for pumping water at the Alert Bay Residential School is worn out and should be replaced. It has been felt the present Diesel Engine should be replaced with a motor. This would give us an automatic system same as used in the Nimpkish Village. The cost would be no more than a Diesel driven installation.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nApril 12th, 1950.\nOn the other hand it has been felt that a Diesel Engine should be installed at the Residential School rather than electric. The reason given in case of failure of the B.C. Power Commission we would still have one pump that could supply both school and village. Personally I do not feel there is much danger of this but it is a point that should be considered. In any case the matter should be referred to our engineers at once with a view to installing a proper pumping equipment.\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nc.c.

Beeching, in connection with the Domestic Water Supply Pump at the above-mentioned school. The school management has been having difficulty with this pump for some time, and for the past several weeks, it has been inoperative and the school has been relying on the Reserve water system. The matter has been the subject of previous correspondence with you, and I believe was brought to your attention by Canon Cook.\n\nMr. Beeching, in his memorandum, gives comparative costs of pumping by electricity and pumping by diesel power, and it is apparent that in spite of the higher initial installation cost, diesel power, over a period of time, will be more economical.\n\nYou will note that a 8 H.P. Petters AV-2 with removable sleeves, is recommended as being the most suitable engine for this job.\n\nI would recommend that the Purchasing Agent be requested to secure such an engine. Installation can be made under the supervision of our Engineering staff.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nRA\nEncl. c.c.: M.S. Todd.\nMEMORANDUM - Norman P. Robinson, Esq.\n\nRe: Alert Bay Residential School\n\nDiesel Engine Driving Domestic Water Supply Pumping Plant.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions, I made an examination of the 5 HP Diesel engine driving the deep well pump at the Alert Bay Residential School on April 15, 1950.\n\nGeneral\n\nFrom observations and previous correspondence written to this Department on this subject, it appears that the plant as it exists today was installed in 1930.\n\nThe installed length of the pump and casing is 65', the depth of the well is about 76' and the depth to the water 55'.\n\nThe pump is a 15 stage type, fitting into a 6\" case and driven by a belt passing around a vertical pulley on the pump and a horizontal pulley on the diesel engine to make altogether a one-quarter turn.\n\nPrevious tests run on the pump showed a capacity of 45 Gals. per minute into a reservoir situated about 100' above the ground elevation of the pump house. However, the present 5 HP Petters Diesel Engine when run at this output was overloaded and the pump capacity was therefore reduced to 30 Gals. per minute. If a new engine is installed it should have a rating of not less than 8 HP in order to cut down on the pump time and increase the efficiency of the plant.\n\nDiesel Engine Presently Installed\n\nThe 5HP Petters engine presently in use is 20 years old, breaks down continually since it is worn out, and should be completely rebuilt. This engine is now an obsolete model and the Supplier has informed us that they would probably have to have many of the parts made up specially if they were to carry out an overhaul job on the engine. This would run the cost of the overhaul job to about $250.00, roughly estimating. The repair bills for the engine alone during the past years have been running up to several hundred dollars annually. This cost could probably have been drastically reduced if the engine had been shipped to Vancouver for a complete overhaul but until recently the main pumping plant for the Alert Bay Village was not adequate to supply both the School and the Village requirements so the plant had to be repaired on the spot in the shortest time possible.\n\nCost Comparison for Diesel and Electric Driving Units\n\nElectric Motor, 7\u00bd HP\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1 - 440V 3-phase 60-cycle Induction Motor | $168.00|\n| 1 - Contactor                             | 29.00  |\n| 1 - Disconnect Switch                     | 15.00  |\n| 1 - Belt Drive with Pulleys               | 100.00 |\n\nElectrical and mechanical installation costs, including about 375' of pole line\n\nFreight - Vancouver - Alert Bay\n\n$422.00\n8 HP Diesel Installation\n\n1 - 8 HP AV-2 Petters Diesel Engine $575.00\n1 - Belt Drive with Pulleys 100.00\nMechanical Installation 30.00\nFreight - Vancouver - Alert Bay 10.00\nTotal $715.00\n\nOperation Cost Comparison\n\nThe following costs have been estimated on an average daily consumption of 12000 Gals. per day:\n\nStatic Head 100 ft 55 = 155 ft\nFriction Head 20 ft\nTotal Dynamic Head 175 ft\n\nTheoretical HP used up in pumping 45 Gals. per minute = \\(\\frac{175 \\times 45}{33,000} = 2.39\\)\n\nAssuming overall efficiency of 50% HP required = \\(\\frac{2.39}{.50} = 4.78\\)\n\nPumping duration per day = \\(\\frac{12000}{45 \\times 60} = 4.45\\) Hrs.\n\nDiesel Engine Operating Cost\n\nFuel consumption based on .5 Lbs. per break HP Hr.\n\nConsumption per day = \\(4.78 \\times 4.45 \\times .5 = 10.6\\) Lbs.\n\nCost per month with Fuel Oil at 18\u00a2 per Gal.\n\n\\(30 \\times 10.6 \\times 0.18 = \\$5.68\\)\n\nElectric Motor Operating Cost\n\nKW Hrs. per month \\(4.78 \\times .746 \\times 4.45 \\times 30 = 477\\) KW Hrs.\n\nB.C.

It is therefore recommended that arrangements be made to purchase a new Diesel Engine to replace the old machine. Since the installation cost of the Diesel engine is only $300.00 more than the electric motor and this will be made up in about two years through a saving in power costs, it can be readily seen that the Diesel engine will be the most practical installation although there will be a slightly higher maintenance cost. But this maintenance cost should not enter into the picture for four or five years and should be more than amply taken care of by the savings in power.\n\nThe most suitable engine for this job would be an 8 HP Petters AV2 with removable sleeves. The Manufacturers' Agent informs me that the cost for a complete overhaul of this machine would run to about $100.00, which is very reasonable when he estimates the life of the engine before requiring this overhaul to be 12 years.\n\nThos.

P. Robinson of this Department, I visited the Alert Bay Residential School to make a final progress inspection of the work which had been carried out in connection with this project.\n\nIn general, the work assigned to the Contractor has been done satisfactorily and in accordance with the drawings supplied by our Head Office.\n\nHeating Plant\n\nThe Contractor has forwarded to us a sketch of the piping plan in the boiler room which is slightly different from the isometric detail shown on the original plan No. 577, Sheet H-1, due to the fact that the boilers were differently positioned as mentioned in our letter to the head of the Engineering & Construction Division dated 9 December 1949. It will also be noticed that the indirect heater is connected to a drip line which is not an ideal arrangement but probably alright in this case. We have, however, taken this matter up with the Contractor and he has agreed to change the hook-up if the exchanger does not operate efficiently when we are able to raise steam to test the system.\n\nThe drip lines from the condensate traps on the header and heat exchanger in the boiler room are 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" which we consider adequate.\n\nThe size of the traps installed on the main steam line at the front end of the building has been changed to one with a capacity of 2,600 square feet of equivalent direct radiation since it was considered that a larger trap would be...\nmore desirable here.\n\nSeptic Tank\n\nThe septic tank has been constructed as shown on Drawing No. 577, Sheet P-1, with the exception of the top of the tank which has been raised about two feet to eliminate the manhole trunks. This change was made without our sanction before we were called in to inspect the job but appears to be fairly practical since the ground has been graded to the level of the top of the tank.\n\nRecommendations\n\n(1) It is recommended that an oil burner be installed as outlined in Mr. N.P. Robinson's recent memorandum since, with the present wood fuel available at Alert Bay, it is impossible to raise steam in the low pressure boilers when the main valves to the heating distribution system are open. For this reason the indirect water heater is presently of no value and the domestic water is now heated by separate coils immersed in the hot water tank supplied with steam from the high pressure boiler. Since the low pressure boilers cannot be fired sufficiently to raise steam, we are of the opinion that the heating system will operate less efficiently since the new steam traps and sump pump have been installed.\n\n(2) The basement radiators are presently not fitted with thermostatic traps so when the steam pressure is available, it will be by-passed to an extent through these radiators.\n\n(3) There are still several of the old drip return lines in the basement without steam traps. It is recommended that these lines be plugged since the new traps now installed should be adequate to handle the condensate in the system lines.\n\n(4) The bellows in the traps at the radiators in the upper floors have not been overhauled since the school was originally constructed. These traps should be fitted with new\nbellows and the valve seats overhauled to ensure efficient operation.\n\nIt is recommended by the writer that arrangements be made in the near future to call for tenders to cover the aforementioned points since the heating plant in its present condition is of little value and serious trouble could develop in the coming winter.\n\nThomas A.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMemorandum to Mr. Arnell:\n\nRe: Wiring Alert Bay Schools\n\nResidential School\n\nIn reply to your memorandum of June 26, we would like to inform you that during Mr. Beeching's visits to the above mentioned school, he did not examine the electrical installation in particular and it would require a survey trip in order to ascertain the exact amount of work required to bring the wiring of the school and the adjacent buildings up to reasonable first class electrical standards required in this province.\n\nHowever, Mr. Beeching noticed that the illumination in the class rooms was well below the standard requirements and this would have to be changed entirely if these rooms are to be used for teaching purposes in the future. Although Mr. Beeching did not examine the staff rooms, it is very probable that the same condition exists as at St. George's Residential School, and outlet receptacle plugs should be installed in each room.\n\nThe system in use at present was originally designed for D.C. and is a 2-wire system but could be easily changed over to a 3-wire system. It was noticed that the conduits and solid neutral connections in the distribution panels and disconnect boxes were not properly grounded. Of course, this is a very dangerous condition.\n\nSeveral additional appliances such as movie picture projectors and cooking electrical appliances are in use at the school and the wiring for this equipment has had to be brought in directly from the outside in a most unsatisfactory manner.\nFrom the above remarks it would appear that the school definitely needs a complete electrical overhaul and we therefore feel that it would not be practical to carry out an inspection and rewiring job on the manual training building alone since this is a small wooden structure apart from the school and actually of small importance in comparison to the other buildings.\n\nDay School\n\nDuring Mr. Beeching's visit to Alert Bay he was shown over the day school and it was noticed by him that there were many small changes required to bring the electrical installation for this school up to reasonable standards. Some of these changes which he noticed included wire sizes required increasing, conduit and distribution panels required grounding, and insulators required fitting to the service entrances, etc.\n\nWe feel that this day school should be given an inspection at the time Mr. Beeching, or any other engineer, visits the residential school for inspection of the electrical installation there, since the latter school is of wooden frame construction and could easily be damaged by a short circuit.\n\nR.

Gibson, M.P. for Comox-Alberni.\n\nFrom correspondence received from the \"Telegraph Cove Mills Limited\" it is evident to the I.S.A. that the lumbering industry on the B.C. coast has more or less complained about the possible conversion to oil at St. Michaels.\n\nYou will realize that the department's decision is most unsatisfactory to us. We asked for conversion to oil for the simple reason that the use of wood and slab-wood as a fuel source was anything but satisfactory. I would like to review some points in the problem.\n\nRe: Slabwood:\n(a) For years past the slabwood supplied by the Telegraph Cove Mills has been of very poor quality and they admit as much to I.S.A. in a letter dated May 18/50. It has also increased considerably in price.\n(b) Handling expenses at the school have increased.\n(c) The whole heating unit is designed to function under a constant and maintained heat source. This is impossible with the use of slabwood as when the fire is made up periodically the heat output is reduced as the heat energy is utilized to ignite, dry out and burn the freshly placed slab wood. As the heat source lowers in heat output the steam pressure is naturally reduced causing undue condensation in the pipes. If we are\nMajor D.M. Mackay  \nJuly 12, 1950\n\nforced to continue the use of slabwood the recent costly overhaul to the heating system will be so much wasted effort, as it cannot function properly.\n\nCordwood -\n\nThis source of fuel has been investigated and while it would be a better fuel than slabwood it has disadvantages as well.\na - It is very expensive per cord\nb - handling costs at the school would be high\nc - An assured source is un procurable. No white concern handles cordwood in or near Alert Bay and the only way the school could get a supply would be from Indian cutters. The Indians are very well off financially and do not want to cut wood even at the present high prices. Even when an Indian can be found who will accept a wood-cutting contract there is no guarantee of delivery.\n\nCoal -\n\nThis source of fuel has also been investigated\na - Its use is impossible because of the very high cost per ton landed at Alert Bay.\nb - We have no facilities at the school for hauling from the barge to the school.\nc - It is dirty and handling costs in the boiler room would be expensive.\nd - No storage facilities at the school for a safe stock pile - It cannot be stored outdoors because of weathering.\n\nIt has been said against St. Michael's use of fuel oil that it would put lumbermen out of work and thus effect the labour situation. This is a weak argument as the slabwood used at St. Michaels is simply \"scrap\" from the saw at the Telegraph Creek mills and little labour would have to be expended to burn the slabwood at the mill or dump it elsewhere as the slabwood has no commercial value when it cannot be sold to the School. Then again labor would not suffer generally because the use of oil at the school would necessitate handling of oil and servicing of equipment by oil company employees.\n\nIt is also pointed out that the Indian Affairs Buildings at Alert Bay - the classrooms and Agents office and residence - have been burning oil for some years past with satisfactory results.\n\nAt its own expense but with Indian Affairs permission the Administration converted two large ranges in the school kitchens into oil burners simply because slabwood gave poor satisfaction.\n\nLast winter the School had a number of oil heating stoves throughout the building and classrooms because the slabwood\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Cook,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian School Administration,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Conversion of Barn to Gymnasium at Alert Bay Indian Residential School\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nReference to exchange of letters between you and Colonel Neary on the above-mentioned subject, please be advised that on my return from the West I reported to Colonel Neary that in my opinion which was shared by our Indian Superintendent, Mr. Todd, and by Inspector Davey, the result of such conversion would not justify the cost.\n\nWhen the school was inspected in the latter part of June, Reverend Allsopp accompanied Mr. Todd, Mr. Davey and myself to the barn and although Inspector Davey from his experience at Alberni believed that we could do the same job at Alert Bay, he changed his mind when he actually saw the place and the Reverend Mr. Allsopp also agreed it would be better to wait and see what could be done in regard to the building of a proper gymnasium which is very much needed for that school. The climate is such at Alert Bay that inclement weather forces the physical recreation programme indoors most of the time.\n\nAs you can very well realize I would have been the first to recommend the conversion of the old barn to a gymnasium had I believed it were possible but I am sure you will agree that it would be much better to spend the money which would have been needed for the conversion...\nfor the construction of a proper gymnasium.\n\nWhen this can be done I do not know but you can rest assured I shall request the erection of such a building in my report to the Superintendent.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIan Eisenhardt,\nSupervisor of Physical Education and Recreation.\n\nIE/NMnN\nColonel B.F. Neary  \nSupt. Indian Education  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. Citizenship & Immigration  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nHaving spoken to Rev. Mr. Allsopp on this subject I quite understand your decision to defer action as regards converting the barn into a gymnasium. However, I am sure Mr. Eisenhardt, having recently visited the School, must realize the need for more interior play space where we house over two hundred children and I trust that shortly some plan will be forthcoming to provide such.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\n\nDictated but not personally signed because of absence from the office\nJuly 18, 1950.\n\nColonel B. F. Neary\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: Conversion of Barn to Gymnasium\nSt. Michael's School, Alert Bay, B.C.\nYour File 875-5(EL)\n\nI have just returned to the office after a weeks absence and have had an opportunity of seeing your letter of 12th July, 1950, on the above subject.\n\nPersonally, I am amazed to read that the information reaching you indicates that the barn could not be converted into a suitable gymnasium because on the occasion of my visit to that school in October last, your Inspector Davey was there and it was he who pointed out that an EXACTLY SIMILAR barn at the United Church School at Alberni had been so converted. As recently as a few weeks ago, Mr. Arnell in course of conversation confirmed Inspector Davey's observations of last October.\n\nIf a service is feasible at Alberni it would certainly seem that a similar service is feasible at Alert Bay and if it is a question of condition of the existing structure my casual inspection of the barn at Alert Bay did not give an impression of unsound timber or imminent collapse of the structure.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.

Manager.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to refer to Departmental file No.156-0-9 in connection with the agreement concerning the leasehold of this Department with the Anglican Synod of British Columbia at Alert Bay, B.C., incidental to which this Department is obligated to the necessary removal of sawmill buildings from the site in accordance with its Agreement dated the 1st day of June 1931.\n\nIn this connection I beg to advise the Department that I received a call from His Lordship Bishop Schofield a few days ago who informs me that the machinery which has for some time been housed in the main building thereof is preventing the demolition thereof. It has now also been arranged that we may now proceed to demolish the building and move the debris from the site. As it is understood there are some heavy timbers connected with this building to be disposed of, it is suggested that the services of a good all round man with carpentry knowledge be obtained to supervise the work. I am not quite sure what the cost will be of clearing this site satisfactorily to ourselves and to the Church Authorities but I would judge that the sum of $500.00 would be an absolutely outside figure. By an understanding reached with the Church Authorities the material to be removed will probably be disposed of partly to the Residential School and local Anglican Church and the balance to deserving Indians who may wish to have it. All other unusable debris to be burned up and the site left in clean condition.\n\nIn view of the fact that it is understood from Mr. Indian Agent Halliday that during last winter certain old buildings were removed from part of this site as they stood within a Right-of-way of a Provincial public thoroughfare in course of construction a sum of money was expended by the Department on relief work under the direction of the Indian Agent, the latter being of the opinion that the sum (approximately $200.00) expended on this work should be reimbursed to this Department by the Provincial Public Works Authorities, and if this is done the amount to be received from the Provincial Authorities might be applied to the above-mentioned undertaking. With this suggestion I am in accord since the question of compensation for clearing the thoroughfare has not yet been adjusted between this Department and the Department of Public Works. It is understood that an engineer of the Provincial Government has recently been on the ground and has made or is making a report to his Department in regard to the thoroughfare.\n\nIn the meantime I would ask that the Department be good enough to advise me if possible what was the amount actually spent....\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nspent by the Department in removing the debris from the public thoroughfare last winter. The Department's letter of March 21st last on file here indicates that a sum of approximately $100.00 was authorized to be spent by the Agent for clearing that portion of the site required for right-of-way. The Department will be aware that Mr. Halliday has now left Alert Bay and his successor may not be able to advise me as promptly as the Department could of the amount spent on this work. I would ask that authority be given to complete the clearing of the site.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Perry,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, October 19, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 15/6/31338 of the third instant, enclosing copies of communications between yourself and His Lordship the Bishop of Columbia and also with Mr. E. G. Newnham, Acting Indian Agent, regarding the wharves at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to the wharf situated in front of the school building, I have to say that Mr. Newnham has been authorized to repair same, at a cost not to exceed $250, provided there are sufficient funds left over from the appropriation of $2,000, which was allowed for repair work at the school.\n\nRegarding the sawmill wharf, which the Department leased from the Anglican Synod of the Diocese of British Columbia as from June 1, 1931, at a nominal rental, I have to say it is noted that this wharf is no use, either to the church authorities or the Department and considerable expenditure would be necessary for repairs. It is noted, further, that Mr. Newnham and myself recommend that the agreement between the Anglican Synod and the Department, in connection with this wharf, be cancelled. As you are of opinion that this wharf is of no use in connection with the school, the Department will approve of the cancelling of the lease of same, provided the church authorities will agree. The Department does not appear to have a copy of the lease, as, by official letter dated May 17, 1931, same was returned to the late Commissioner Betchurn, after execution by the Deputy Superintendent General. After taking the matter up with the church authorities, please advise if they will consent to the cancelling of the lease of the sawmill wharf. In view of the cancellation, the Department would give favourable consideration to the keeping in repair of the school wharf, in so far as funds permit from time to time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nOttawa, October 26, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 15/6/26651 of the 18th instant, regarding the removal of the old sawmill buildings from the Alert Bay Indian Residential School site, in accordance with the agreement with the authorities of the Anglican Church, and giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $500 in having the old buildings removed and moving the material and debris from the site. It is noted that the machinery which had been housed in the main building has now been removed. Indian labour should be employed as far as possible, and, if necessary, the services of a man with carpentry knowledge could be engaged to supervise the work.\n\nIt is understood that the material in the buildings to be removed will be disposed of, partly to the Residential School and local Anglican Church and the balance to deserving Indians who may wish to obtain same. All the other unusable debris should be burned and the site left in a clean condition. Accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the labour employed and for any other expenses, should be forwarded for payment.\n\nRegarding the work that was undertaken last winter\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B. C.\nlast winter, in removing certain buildings which stood within a right of way of a Provincial thoroughfare in course of construction, I have to say that the Department paid the sum of $96 for the labour employed. If you obtain reimbursement of this amount from the Provincial Public Works authorities, they should make their cheque in payment to the credit of the Receiver General and it should be forwarded to the Department. Under the regulations of the Auditor General, it will not be possible to apply this amount towards the expenses in removing the other buildings. It is noted that the matter of reimbursement by the Provincial authorities is now receiving consideration.\n\nThe Department will leave the matter in your hands to make the best arrangements possible in having the old sawmill buildings removed, the materials distributed and the site properly cleaned up. This work should be completed as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nThis special covering letter is being written on behalf of Gideon Whonnock, Indian of the Kwawkewlth Band and ex-pupil of the Residential School, who owns a house on that portion of Hill Street located between Lots 6 and 7 and between Front Street and Broughton Street on the sub-division of the Special Industrial School reserve, and is living there permanently.\n\nWhonnock has made application to this office to have this portion of Hill Street allotted to him as a lot, to be known as Lot No. 6A, and that he be given a certificate of approval from the Department.\n\nIn connection with this application, I wish to point out to the Department this street allowance is a very steep grade and will never be used for street purposes. The natural thoroughfare to serve Lots 12, 13 and 14 and those located north of them will be Broughton and Park Streets, and this portion of Hill Street now occupied by Gideon Whonnock would make a good lot with water frontage.\n\nI would therefore recommend that this street allowance between Broughton and Front Street be cancelled, and this area transferred from street allowance into two lots, the south half with the water frontage to be given to Gideon Whonnock and known as Lot No. 6A, and the upper or northern portion to be known as Lot No. 6B, and reserved for another applicant. My reason for making this suggestion is on account of the steep hill which practically makes the upper half a separate parcel as far as being of any benefit to the holder of the lower half.\n\nI particularly would like the Department's decision in respect to granting this location to Gideon Whonnock as it is his intention to improve the property this fall and he does not wish to spend any more money on it until the Department's approval has been received. I might add the area above referred to has a frontage of 69.9 feet, and would make an excellent lot for Whonnock but is of no use as far as a street allowance is concerned.\n\nWould the Department kindly advise me their views in regard to this particular portion of the sub-division.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nAugust 13, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nAs stated in my Report attached hereto, I wish to place before the Department certain information in connection with Lot 9 now occupied by Ben Isaac and his family who is a member of the Katzie Band of the New Westminster Agency.\n\nMrs. Isaac was formerly Dorothy Howell, and when her father died this property was left to her and her half-brother, Bertie Blenkinsop. Bertie has made his home there ever since, and Mrs. Isaac has spent most of the time here since her marriage caring for her mother, who has since died. Mr. Daunt, Indian Agent of the New Westminster Agency, has requested that Isaac return to his own Agency, stating he had a good farm there which was deteriorating through no one looking after it. This information was passed on to Isaac, and he promised to return to his own Agency last year when the fishing season was over. I later spoke to him, and he said he was going as soon as he could make arrangements, but to date no arrangements have been made and he is still living in this house.\n\nIsaac is not a desirable Indian to remain in this Agency; he is of the \"wise\" type, an agitator, and a bad influence amongst other Indians through his drinking, and it is my desire to have him sent back to his own Agency where he has a home. It was for this reason I wrote the Department under date of June 25th last in which I referred to \"some Indians from Agencies other than the Kwawkwethl Agency who have taken up residence on the Special Industrial School Reserve at Alert Bay\" and requested to know if they had any legal status to remain on this reserve by virtue of Mrs. Isaac being an ex-pupil of the Residential School.\n\nI do not wish to take any action with a view to having him return to his own Agency and then find complications might exist giving him permission to remain on this Special Reserve through the fact of his wife being an ex-pupil.\n\nWhat I wish to know is, has Isaac any right to remain here, and will the Department give me authority to have him returned to his own reserve in order that the difficulties experienced through his presence here may be cleared up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, July 8, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to certain Indians from agencies other than Kwawkewlth who have taken up residence on the Special Industrial School Reserve at Alert Bay.\n\nPlease let me know the names of the Indians to whom you refer and the agency from which each of them comes. Are all of these ex-pupils of the Alert Bay School? Have you made enquiries from the Principal of that School with a view to ascertaining if he encouraged these Indians to settle on this land? Any other information that you can obtain should also be forwarded for our consideration. No action should be taken towards ejecting them until you receive definite instructions from the Department.\n\nFor your information, I quote from letter written to Mr. W. M. Halliday, Indian Agent, Alert Bay, B.C., on October 15, 1913:\n\n\"Any ex-pupil of the school may be settled on one of the said lots by yourself and then with the sanction of the Department. Also any Indian and his family in what was formerly known as the Kwawkewlth Agency may be settled by yourself on one or the said lots provided it is subsequently approved by the Department and provided he intends to send one or more of his children to the Industrial School. It is therefore your duty to make these allotments and to submit them for the approval of the Department.\"\n\nAt that time the Department was aware that several ex-pupils of the Alert Bay School had settled on the land in question, and you will note that the intention was to only settle other ex-pupils provided they had the consent of yourself and the Department.\n\nThe total amount of the land held for school purposes at Alert Bay is approximately 410 acres. Of this, approximately 61 acres was originally intended for the settlement of ex-pupils. The remainder was intended for the use of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nI have carefully reviewed our files and have been unable to find any request that has been made within the last ten or fifteen years for any ex-pupil to settle on the land intended for them. Now that the question has been raised, you might let me know approximately how many Indians are now residing on this 61 acre plot and the total amount of land which they occupy. We will then know how much of the plot is unoccupied.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJune 25, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nRecently some Indians from Agencies other than the Kwawkewlth Agency have taken up residence on the Special Industrial School Reserve at Alert Bay, and their Indian Agent has communicated with me with a view to having them returned to their own Agency and reserve, but on taking the matter up with the Indians concerned they state this forty acre parcel was set aside for residence of ex-pupils of the Alert Bay Residential School, and feel they have a right to make their home there.\n\nBefore this office takes any action, it would be appreciated if the Department would kindly give us a ruling on this and advise if any Indians from other Agencies are permitted to live on this Special Industrial School Reserve even though they are ex-pupils of the School, or whether it is only reserved for ex-pupils of this Agency.\n\nThis office feels a definite ruling should be made and it would be in the best interests of the Indians concerned if the Department would not permit any Indian to live on this reserve who does not belong to the Kwawkewlth Agency. An early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, 4th April 1935\n\nAlert Bay Industrial School Reserve\nCormorant Island, Rupert District, B.C.\n\nThe original Minute of Decision setting this reserve apart stated that the land was set apart as reserve No.6 of the Nimkeeshe band and this was approved by the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works. At the suggestion of the Department, the Minute was amended by Commissioner O'Reilly and again approved by the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works, as follows:\n\n\"Minute of Decision, 5th Mar. 1891, approved by Chief Commissioner of Lands 10th Mar. 1891, setting apart as reserve 410 ac.\"\n\n\"Minute of Decision,\nAlert Bay Indian Industrial School reserve.\n\nA reserve of four hundred and ten (410) acres situated at the western extremity of Cormorant Island, and to the West of, and adjoining the Revd. A.J. Hall's Claim, Section Four (4) Rupert District.\n\nCommencing at the Southwest corner post of Section Four (4), Rupert District, and running North to the seacoast; thence in a westerly direction, and following the seashore to the place of commencement.\n\nIn a letter dated June 6th 1904, the Indian Agent requested that a portion of the land be subdivided and allotted to certain ex-pupils of the school who had been permitted by the former Agent to settle on a portion of the property. This being recommended by the Indian Superintendent, the Department approved and a subdivision was laid out by A.H. Green, B.C.L.S. The question of issuing location tickets to the Indian locators was then brought up and it being decided that the reserve was set apart for a special purpose and not an Indian reserve or a special reserve within the meaning of the Indian Act, the Department could not issue location tickets.\n\nThe Department endeavoured to obtain title to the land from the Province, but were unsuccessful, the decision expressed by the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works being, \"that owing to the unsatisfactory state of affairs between the Dominion and the Province in relation to the question of Indian reserves, the Executive considers it inadvisable in the meantime to make further allotments, but...\"\nwill be prepared to consider any application by the Department for purchase or deal with suitable exchanges.\" Here the question was dropped. The Royal Commission, on being requested to declare a portion of the land including the subdivided portion to be an Indian reserve, replied that, \"Inasmuch as the tract of land comprised in the Industrial School reserve at Alert Bay was alienated by the Province of British Columbia and subsequently acquired by the Government of the Dominion of Canada for a school reserve, the Commission has no authority to constitute or confirm the whole or any portion thereto as an Indian Reserve under the terms of the Agreement, the Dominion being the unquestionable owner of the property and unhampered by the terms of the Agreement in dealing therewith in such manner as may appear to the Dominion Government to best meet the purposes of the purchase of the said land; but that from what the Commission learned at meetings with the Indians at Alert Bay, it seems to the Commission that it would be right and proper to secure in occupation the Indians who have, with the consent or acquiescence of the Department of Indian Affairs, made homes upon the said tract of land.\"\n\nFollowing this opinion, the Department on Sept. 14th 1914, instructed the Indian Agent to \"give recognition of title in writing to each individual occupant of land on this property,\" but the regular form of Location Ticket was not issued.\n\nOn the recommendation of Mr. Ditchburn, Inspector of Indian Agencies, instructions were issued on Jan. 29th 1915 to subdivide a portion of the reserve extending across the island and contiguous to the East boundary, into lots of approximately one acre to include within the new lots the improvements contained in the former subdivision. A subdivision of 40 lots, including streets, was laid out, the aggregate area of the lots being 66.21 acres and of the streets 15 acres, more or less, or approximately 80.25 acres in all, as shown on plan B.C.277.\n\nIn 1928, the Department built a new school on the property, the total cost of which, including furnishings, and clearing sufficient for the use of the school, was in the neighbourhood of $200,000.00.\n\nAlthough the communication from the Royal Commission refers to the property as having been purchased there is no evidence of the purchase on the departmental files. The reserve is not shown on the Schedule of Indian Reserves, was not included in the report of the Royal Commission, nor is it included in the schedule of those lands presently to be conveyed to the Department by the Province.\nSo far as the school is concerned, the title to the reserve is secure so long as it continues to be used for the purpose for which the grant was made, but it will be necessary at some time to purchase the subdivided portion, in order to protect the improvements of the Indians who have been encouraged to settle thereon.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6429, file 875-9, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nReference file 116,947-1 - Oct. 1913.\n\nI beg to refer to my letter No.116/32339, addressed to the Department on December 16th, 1935, in which I requested to be advised as to the Department's pleasure concerning the status of the Alert Bay Industrial School Reserve. No reply has been received to that letter, and it seems to be advisable that the question should be asked as to whether the School Reserve has the same status as other reserves insofar as title is concerned.\n\nThe Department will have on record the cancelled Minute which at first contemplated the setting aside of the reserve as No.6 Nimpkish Tribe but which was afterwards superseded by a Minute setting aside the Reserve especially for school purposes.\n\nThe Department will be aware that the Schedule of reserves is nearing completion with respect to the conveyance of reserves in British Columbia, and as the School Reserve has not been included in the Schedule it is suggested the Department may wish to communicate with the Provincial Authorities with a view to the inclusion as a reserve, not for the Nimpkish Tribe but for the purposes prescribed in the Minute setting it apart. Unless this is done, there seems a possibility that the Province may hesitate to convey the land (410 acres) as a reserve and its status be thereby affected. The late Commissioner Ditchburn in a letter addressed to the late Principal Corker informed him that the land had been purchased but I am not satisfied from our other records that such is the case.\n\nThe record of the Provincial Authorities appears to be only a Minute setting aside the Reserve for School purposes and approved by the ex-Minister of Lands, but this does not appear sufficient title if there is a possibility of having the parcel included in the conveyance or registered as a purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Is the Indian Industrial School reserve regarded by the Department as an Indian Reserve coming within the scope of the Indian Act as in all regular reserves, or special reserves as defined by Sec. 2(k) Indian Act?\n\n2. In the event of enfranchisement of any Indian occupying a lot in the Industrial School Reserve by authority of the Department, would the Indian so enfranchised be required to move away from the lot and forfeit any right or interest therein?\n\nThese phases do not appear to be covered by the provisos outlined so far by the Department and shown in our files, in regard to the regulations of the School Reserve by the Department.\n\nI shall thank the Department to be good enough to consider the two questions above mentioned and advise me in due course of its pleasure regarding them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

Indian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nP/AC\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFred Isaac Cook, No.42 of the Nimpkish Band, and ex-pupil of the Alert Bay Residential School, now married to Margaret Newman also an ex-pupil of the School, made an agreement with Carey Newman, registered owner of Lot No.2 of the subdivision of the Industrial School Reserve, Alert Bay, Cormorant Island, whereby Newman was to transfer one-half of this lot to Fred Cook so that he could build a home there for himself and family.\n\nOwing to Cook being anxious to proceed with the erection of his home, Newman gave him permission to do so before approval from the Department was received. I informed him at the time nothing could be done until the Department approved of it, but as they were anxious to proceed with the house during the time Cook was unemployed, no exception was made to it, and Cook now has his house partially completed.\n\nAs Newman does not need all this lot, and has signed the enclosed agreement, I would recommend that the Department approve of same at an early date. I enclose you herewith a rough sketch showing that portion of the lot which Newman has transferred to Fred Cook.\n\nI might add all these acre lots seem to be more than any Indian requires for a home, and it has been found necessary to recommend that they be divided up to provide space for new homes to be built at Alert Bay.\n\nI hope the Department will understand the Indians' position, and will approve of this transfer as I know it is in the best interests of both.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

The status of this reserve seems to be so indefinite it is difficult to clearly understand it, and it is for this reason that I would like a ruling from the Department.\n\nI would also suggest at this time that the Department arrange to purchase the entire Industrial School Reserve, including the sub-division, and make it into a Special Reserve, so that the property can be properly administered. A great deal of correspondence has taken place over this reserve in the past, and I feel the time has come when the ownership should be clearly defined, and would recommend that the Department purchase it outright from the Provincial Government in order to get a proper title.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

In connection with the ex-pupils desiring to build on the subdivided lots, the Department agrees that they should give an undertaking, in writing, with the application, to the effect that they are giving up the Indian customs, will not participate in any way, and will have nothing further to do with the objectionable group who promote the affair. Failure to keep such agreement leaves the property open to forfeiture.\n\nThe Indians might be again informed that the Department strongly disapproves of an ex-pupil joining with any Indian customs or \"Potlatch\" group.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Caldwell,\nChief, Reserves Division.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir,-\n\nMany years ago the Department surveyed a forty acre parcel belonging to the Industrial School Reserve at Alert Bay into one acre lots, and had it set aside for ex-pupils who wished to build a home and to escape from the environment of villages where the \"Potlatch\" was still being practiced.\n\nI do not believe this regulation in regard to the practice of the Indian Custom was ever officially recorded although it was understood definitely by the Indians, the Residential School and the local Indian Agent at that time, and this policy has been followed ever since.\n\nDuring the past few years the practice of the Indian Custom has become more evident with the result that ex-pupils of the school are now being forced into it against their own better judgment, and in view of this it is felt the Department should be asked to make a definite regulation that any ex-pupil applying for a lot in this Industrial Reserve site should definitely give the Department an undertaking that they will give up the Custom and have nothing further to do with it if a lot is given to them for the purpose of building a home.\n\nThis is one way in which we may check the practice and protect these young people who desire to live according to the teachings of good citizenship.\n\nI would therefore ask the Department to approve and issue definite instructions that any person applying for a lot in this Industrial School Reserve should definitely state and agree not to practice the Indian Custom in any respect before the Department will approve of locating him on this Reserve, and failure to keep such agreement forfeits any claims he may have if proven against him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

Earl Anfield\"\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir,\n\nWith further reference to the special Industrial School Reserve at Alert Bay and with particular reference to your letter of August 15, 1936, dealing with the various lots occupied by Indians at the present time, I shall reply to each paragraph as set out in your letter:\n\nLot 1, occupied by Stephen Cook, was dealt with in our letter of February 28th last.\n\nLot 2 appears to have changed hands a few times and is now occupied by Gary Newman. The Department concurs in your recommendation of his occupation.\n\nAs Lot 3 is occupied by Chief Joseph Harris I advise that the Department approves of your recommendation in connection with this location.\n\nAs Benjamin Brotschie occupies Lot 4 at the present time the Department also approves of your recommendation in connection with this lot. I have endeavoured to locate the recommendation of the Department in connection with Lot 5 but so far have not found the correspondence. I feel assured, however, that the then Agent must have had departmental approval before he located Richard Flanders on the lot. As Flanders transferred his interest to Herbert Cook the Department approves of his occupation.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nBritish Columbia.\nIn connection with Lot 4, which appears to have changed hands many times, and is now owned and occupied by Charles Beaman, I would point out that the Department approves of Mr. Beaman's occupation. The Department also approves of your recommendation that the house should be moved back to a position on the north end of the lot. The street allowance between Lots 5 and 7 was dealt with in our letter of January 21st.\n\nThe Department confirms the approval previously given, in connection with James Prevost occupying Lot 7.\n\nThe Department approves of David Shaughnessy occupying Lot 8.\n\nLot 9 was dealt with in our letter of February 19th.\n\nI am unable to locate any record in connection with the transfer of Lot 10 as school property, and possibly Mr. Amfield may be able to furnish you with a record showing the Department's approval.\n\nThe Department approves of Moses Alfred occupying Lot 11. I am unable to locate any reference to Lot 12 in our correspondence but assume that Mr. Haliday must have received authority to locate Mrs. William Brotchie on this lot. In view of the transfer of the property to Geoffrey Hunt and your recommendation in the matter the Department approves of his occupation.\n\nThe Department approves of Priss Bruse occupying Lot 20 as you report that he has made certain improvements and erected a house thereon, and recommend issue of certificate.\n\nI trust that this information will be satisfactory.\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes\nSecretary\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter No. 156-0-9B dated Ottawa, February 26th last, in connection with an application of Stephen Cook, member of the Nimipkish Band and ex-pupil of the Indian Residential School, to have Lot No.1 of the Industrial School Reserve which is now registered in his name, subdivided and part of it transferred to his son-in-law and daughter who are also ex-pupils of the School, and in which letter the Department requested that an Agreement be drawn up between the parties concerned.\n\nIn reply, I would advise this Agreement has been drawn up and signed by Stephen Cook and Robson and Winnifred Bell, and witnessed by myself, and I trust the Department will find it in order.\n\nThe sketch attached to the Agreement indicates that portion of Lot No.1 which is being transferred, the dimensions of which are 46 x 132'.\n\nWould the Department kindly approve of this and advise us accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Tedd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No.156-0-9 dated July 8, 1936, in reference to Indians being located on the Special Industrial School Reserve at Alert Bay, I beg to herewith submit the following report on those Indians who have made application to reside on this reserve and whose application has been recommended by the Indian Agent and approved by the Department, as well as those Indians residing on this reserve without permission or authority from the Department. For the purpose of making a complete report, we are taking each lot separately as shown on Map No. 277 B.C., subdivision of Part of Indian Industrial School Reserve, Alert Bay, Cormorant Island, Rupert District, B.C., of which the Department no doubt have a copy.\n\nIn order to have the status of each lot brought up to date, we are requesting the Department to confirm all former approvals given by them, and recommending that all lots now held by various Indians through purchase, be approved and confirmed by the Department.\n\nLot No.1 - This lot is registered in the name of Stephen Cook, a member of the Nimpkish Band, who made application for the same as an ex-pupil of the Residential School, and was granted authority in Departmental letter dated September 14, 1914. This lot has been held by him ever since, and although at the present time he is not living thereon, it is nevertheless recognized as his property and he is holding it for one of his sons.\n\nI would recommend that the approval granted by the Department on September 14, 1914, be confirmed, and a certificate to this effect issued.\n\nLot No.2 - This lot was applied for by Charles Newman, an Indian of the Kwawkewlth Band, and his application approved by the Department on September 14, 1914. He has now transferred his interests to his son, Carey Newman, of the Kwawkewlth Band, who is now living on this property.\n\nI would request the Department's approval of this transfer from Charles Newman to Carey Newman, and would recommend that a certificate be issued to Carey Newman.\n\nLot No.3 - This lot was granted to Chief Joseph Harris of the Nimpkish Band by Departmental letter of September 14, 1914, and he is still residing thereon. I would therefore recommend that the Department issue a certificate confirming this approval to Chief Joseph Harris.\n\nLot No.4 - Annie Kamano was the original owner of this lot by authority in Departmental letter of September 14, 1914. She sold her interests, and the improvements on this property have changed hands many times, and the present owner is Benjamin Brotchie, ex pupil, and member of the Kwawkewlth Band, but there is no record of his location having been approved by the Department. As he intends to keep his home on this property, I would recommend that the Department approve of his location on this lot, and issue a certificate approving of same to him.\nLot No.6 - This is one case where it would appear the Department has given permission to settle on land where Indians have apparently squatted without the approval of the Department. From old-time Indians we have learned in regard to Lot No.8 that Richard Flanders, a member of the Namiklikulla Band and ex-pupil of the Residential School, built a small house on this lot, later selling it to an Indian lady by the name of Lily of the Klowitzis Band. This Indian has now disposed of her interests to Herbert Cook of the Nimpkish Band, who has improved the property and is making his home there.\n\nIn this case I would recommend that the Department approve of Herbert Cook's location on this lot, and issue a certificate to this effect to him.\n\nLot No.5 - An application from Michael Kamano, white, was forwarded to the Department on March 1st, 1921 for this lot, and the Department later approved of his location in a letter dated March 11th, 1921. At the time his application was forwarded a special covering letter was enclosed explaining this application, which was later approved by the Department.\n\nThis lot has changed hands through the sale of the improvements, and is now owned and occupied by Charles Newman, Indian of the Kwawkewlth Band, an ex-pupil of the Residential School, and I would recommend that the Department approve of Charles Newman as owner of this lot and issue a certificate to him to that effect.\n\nOn this same lot there is another small house built which is partially located on Lot 6 and partially on the street known as Hill Street. This house was originally built by Spruce Martin, member of the Kwawkewlth Band whose children are all ex-pupils of the Residential School. He has returned to his own village at Fort Rupert and the house is occupied by Charlie James, a member of the Kwawkewlth Band who is the step-father of Spruce Martin.\n\nIn connection with this house, I would recommend that it be moved back to a position on the back end of Lot 6 so that it will be entirely on this lot as there is plenty of room for a house at the back end of this lot.\n\nOn Street Allowance Between Lots 6 and 7 - Gideon Whonnock, ex-pupil of the Residential School, has built a home on Hill Street, fronting on Front Street, between Lots 6 and 7. No approval was given to him for the erection of this house as far as our records show but as the back portion of this street leading to Broughton Street is a very steep grade and in my opinion would not be suitable for street; I would recommend that the rear portion of Hill Street be transferred from a thoroughfare to a lot calling the front portion if it Lot No. 6A, and the upper or back half Lot No. 6B, and granting the front portion of it to Whonnock where he has already settled. It will never be used for street purposes, and the lots to the rear can be reached more satisfactorily by way of Park and Broughton Streets. A special letter in this connection is being forwarded on behalf of Whonnock, making this recommendation.\n\nLot No.7 - This lot was applied for by James Prevost, Indian of the Nimpkish Band, and granted to him by Departmental letter of September 14th, 1914. It is still held by him and he has lived for many years in his home erected on this location. I would recommend that the Department at this time confirm the approval given to James Prevost as to his location on this lot.\nLot No. 8 - This lot was allotted to David Shaughnessy, Indian of the Seminole Band, an ex-pupil of the Residential School and he was approved under date of January 9, 1920 by the then Indian Agent, Mr. W.M. Halliday, but we cannot locate in our files where the Department approved of this, although no doubt their approval had been received as Mr. Halliday states he \"had been instructed by the Department to issue this approval.\" Mr. Shaughnessy has lived on this property ever since, has improved it greatly, and during the past year has built another home on the back of the lot for his son.\n\nI would therefore recommend that the Department issue a certificate of approval granting this lot to David Shaughnessy.\n\nLot No. 9 - This lot was granted to William Brothie by Departmental letter dated September 14, 1914. He is now deceased but he had sold his interest and the improvements on this property to Thomas Howell who is now also deceased. Before Thomas Howell died, he left the improvements on this lot jointly to his daughter Dorothy Howell and his step-son Bertie Blenkinsop, both of the Kwakwaka'wakw Band, and the property remains today in their names. Since then Dorothy Howell has married an Indian by the name of Ben Isaac who belongs to the Katzie Band of the New Westminster Agency and they have made their home here most of the time since they were married as Mrs. Isaac was caring for her mother who had just died. Bertie Blenkinsop her half-brother, and part owner of the property, has always made his home here, and has kept the property in repair. Both the owners of this lot are ex-pupils of the Residential School, but as Ben Isaac, husband of the former Dorothy Howell is not a desirable resident in this Agency, it is my desire to have him moved back to his own Agency. A special letter is being forwarded the Department in regard to this particular case, but I would recommend that Bertie Blenkinsop purchase Mrs. Ben Isaac's interest from her, and that a certificate be issued to Bertie Blenkinsop at the time of transfer.\n\nLot No. 10 - I am advised by Mr. Anfield, Principal of the Alert Bay Residential School, that this lot has been transferred to the school property, and that it no longer belongs to the subdivision of the Industrial School Reserve, but has been cleared and a residence built on it for the engineer of the Residential School, therefore it is not available for residential purposes as far as this Special Reserve is concerned.\n\nAs we have no particulars in regard to this, would the Department kindly advise me the date on which this lot was transferred and any other particulars pertaining to the transfer.\n\nLot No. 11 - Arthur Stanley, an ex-pupil of the Residential School but who has always been classed as white, was granted this lot and approved by the Department in their letter of September 19, 1922. The covering letter at the time of his application gives a full explanation why this was approved. Arthur Stanley owned this house on this lot until recently when he sold it for cash to Moses Alfred, an Indian of the Nimpkish Band and an ex-pupil of the school, who is now the present owner.\n\nI would recommend that the Department issue a certificate of approval to Moses Alfred for his ownership of this lot.\n\nLot No. 12 - No approval was given by the Department as far as our records show to Mrs. William Brothie, ex-pupil, who built a home on this lot and greatly improved it. About a year ago after Mr. Brothie died, Mrs. Brothie sold the house to Godfrey Hunt, an ex-pupil, a member of the Kwakwaka'wakw Band, who owns it at the present time and is living therein. I would therefore recommend that the Department issue a certificate of approval to Godfrey Hunt for his ownership of this lot.\nLots No. 19 are vacant, and no application is on file or any approval granted for any of them.\n\nLot No. 20 - Price Bruce, an Indian of the Matilpi Band, and ex-pupil of the Residential School, has built a house and done certain improvements on this lot, but we cannot find where any approval was given by the Department for his location, however there is a possibility that the then Indian Agent gave him permission to build there. He is making his home on this lot at the present time, and I would recommend that the Department approve of Price Bruce's location on this lot and issue a certificate accordingly.\n\nLots No. 21 to 40 - the remainder of the lots in this subdivision are unoccupied with no improvements made and no applications on file for occupation.\n\nAs no doubt the Department have a copy of Survey and Plan No. 277 B.C. as surveyed by F.E. Leach under date of June 13, 1915 which gives full particulars as to the amount of land in each lot, with the further information given in this report as to the lots located upon, the Department will be able to arrive at the amount of land occupied and by whom, and the amount still untenanted and available for residential purposes.\n\nAs we are anxious to get this situation straightened out satisfactorily, would the Department please give it their early consideration?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S.

(RG 10, Volume 6429, file 875-9, part 3)\nD. J. Allan, Esq.,\nSuperintendent Reserves and Trusts,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Allan:\n\nAmong the hundred or more parcels of Ordnance and Admiralty lands being investigated by this Commission is one listed on the Return to the Legislature of British Columbia in 1873, No. 65, Cormorant Island, being the westerly part of Cormorant Island, north of Vancouver Island. It was set aside for Admiralty purposes, supposedly to command the entrance to Johnstone Strait, and was estimated to contain 500 acres.\n\nProvincial records show this reserve surveyed as 412 acres, and to be the western part of Cormorant Island, and noted \"Indian Industrial School Reserve\" on their existing maps. It is known to have an Industrial School in operation, which, according to the files in the office of the Indian Commissioner at Vancouver, cost upwards of $200,000, and being administered under your Branch.\n\nAccording to the Provincial records, the title to this land is held in the right of the Crown Provincial, and never has been transferred to the Crown Dominion. There does not seem to be any explanation, although there is evidence it was approved to be so transferred some years ago.\n\nIt is not included in the schedule of reserves conveyed to the Crown Dominion by Order-in-Council, 29th July 1936. There does not appear to have been any application for the same, and it would appear that the only consideration given by the Royal Commission 1912-14 is summed up by the following memo, dated 4th April, 1935, by D. Robertson, Chief Surveyor:\n\n\"The Royal Commission, on being requested to declare a portion of the land including the subdivided portion to be an Indian reserve, replied that, 'Inasmuch as the tract of land comprised in the Industrial School reserve at Alert Bay was alienated by the Province of British Columbia and subsequently acquired by\nthe Government of the Dominion of Canada for a school reserve, the Commission has no authority to constitute or confirm the whole or any portion thereto as an Indian Reserve under the terms of the Agreement, the Dominion being the unquestionable owner of the property and unhampered by the terms of the Agreement in dealing therewith in such manner as may appear to the Dominion Government to best meet the purposes of the purchase of the said land; but that from what the Commission learned at meetings with the Indians at Alert Bay, it seems to the Commission that it would be right and proper to secure in occupation the Indians who have, with the consent or acquiescence of the Department of Indian Affairs, made homes upon the said tract of land.\n\n\"Although the communication from the Royal Commission refers to the property as having been purchased, there is no evidence of the purchase on the departmental files. The reserve is not shown on the Schedule of Indian Reserves, was not included in the Report of the Royal Commission, nor is it included in the schedule of those lands presently to be conveyed to the Department by the Province.\"\n\nI believe that the Province may now be in the attitude to clear off this item by negotiation along with the other Ordinance matters, but first we should be sure of the history, and when mention is made by the Royal Commission that the land had been purchased, and title obtained, it should be ascertained without a doubt that the Indian Affairs records do not have particulars of such purchase and the conveyance giving title.\n\nProvincial records show very definitely the land held in the name of the Province of British Columbia, and the Deputy Minister is at a loss to know why title has not been transferred.\n\nI have taken the matter up with Mr. D.M. Mackay, Commissioner for British Columbia, and we think this an excellent opportunity to clear up the question.\n\nWill you please furnish me, at your earliest possible convenience, with information as to the status of this Reserve as it appears on your Departmental records.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDominion Representative.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nre British Columbia Land Reservation for the Alert Bay Indian School-Cormorant Island.\n\nMay I draw your attention to the attached letter, addressed to the writer by Mr. C. H. Taggart, dated March 6th, in reference to the above.\n\nAn examination of available files discloses a report (copies attached), dated April 4, 1935, which gives the history of this reservation and its title status at that time. From the minutes of decision quoted from this report it would appear that \"Four hundred and ten (410) acres situated at the western extremity of Cormorant Island, and to the west of, and adjoining the Reverend A. J. Hall's claim, Section Four (4) Rupert District\", was on the 10th of March, 1891, set apart as a site for the Alert Bay Indian School by the then Chief Commissioner of Lands for British Columbia. It would appear that on that act of the Commissioner our present title rests.\n\nMr. Taggart states that this land is not included in the Order in Council dealing generally with Indian lands and reserves in British Columbia, and suggests that the time is opportune to ask British Columbia for a formal conveyance.\n\nSuggested course approved\n\nJ.

At the suggestion of the Department, the Minute was amended by Commissioner O'Reilly and again approved by the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works, as follows:\n\n\"Minute of Decision, 5th Mar. 1891, approved by Chief Commissioner of Lands 10th Mar. 1891, setting apart as reserve 410 ac.\"\n\n\"Minute of Decision,\nAlert Bay Indian Industrial School reserve.\n\nA reserve of four hundred and ten (410) acres situated at the western extremity of Cormorant Island, and to the West of, and adjoining the Revd.

The question of issuing location tickets to the Indian locates was then brought up and it being decided that the reserve was set apart for a special purpose and not an Indian Reserve or a special reserve within the meaning of the Indian Act, the Department could not issue location tickets.\n\nThe Department endeavoured to obtain title to the land from the Province, but were unsuccessful, the decision expressed by the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works being, \"that owing to the unsatisfactory state of affairs between the Dominion and the Province in relation to the question of Indian reserves, the Executive considers it undesirable in the meantime to make further allotments, but will be prepared to consider any application by the Department for purchase, or deal with suitable exchanges.\" Here the question was dropped.

This being recommended by the Indian Superintendent, the Department approved and a subdivision was laid out by A. H. Green, B.C.L.S. The question of issuing location tickets to the Indian locators was then brought up and it being decided that the reserve was set apart for a special purpose and not an Indian reserve or a special reserve within the meaning of the Indian Act, the Department could not issue location tickets.\n\nThe Department endeavoured to obtain title to the land from the Province, but were unsuccessful, the decision expressed by the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works being: \"That owing to the unsatisfactory state of affairs between the Colonization and the Indians in relation to the question of Indian reserves, the Executive considers it inadvisable in the meantime to make further allotments, but will be prepared to consider any application by the Department for purchase, or deal with suitable exchanges.\" Here the question was dropped. The Royal Commission, on being requested to declare a portion of the land including the subdivided portion to be an Indian\nreserve, replied that, \"Inasmuch as the tract of land comprised in the Industrial School reserve at Alert Bay was alienated by the Province of British Columbia and subsequently acquired by the Government of the Dominion of Canada for a school reserve, the Commission has no authority to constitute or confirm the whole or any portion thereto as an Indian Reserve under the terms of the Agreement, the Dominion being the unquestionable owner of the property and unhampered by the terms of the Agreement in dealing therewith in such manner as may appear to the Dominion Government to best meet the purposes of the purchase of the said land; but that from what the Commission learned at meetings with the Indians at Alert Bay, it seems to the Commission that it would be right and proper to secure in occupation the Indians who have, with the consent or acquiescence of the Department of Indian Affairs, made homes upon the said tract of land.\"\n\nFollowing this opinion, the Department on Sept. 14th 1914, instructed the Indian Agent to \"give recognition of title in writing to each individual occupant of land on this property,\" but the regular form of Location Ticket was not issued.\n\nOn the recommendation of Mr. Litchburn, Inspector of Indian Agencies, instructions were issued on Jan. 29th 1915 to subdivide a portion of the reserve extending across the island and contiguous to the East boundary, into lots of approximately one acre to include within the new lots the improvements contained in the former subdivision. A subdivision of 40 lots, including streets, was laid out, the aggregate area of the lots being 66.21 acres and of the streets 15 acres, more or less, or approximately 80.25 acres in all, as shown on plan B.C. 277.\n\nIn 1928, the Department built a new school on the property, the total cost of which, including furnishings, and clearing sufficient for the use of the school, was in the neighbourhood of $200,000.00.\n\nAlthough the communication from the Royal Commission refers to the property as having been purchased, there is no evidence of the purchase on the departmental files. The reserve is not shown on the Schedule of Indian Reserves, was not included in the Report of the Royal Commission, nor is it included in the schedule of those lands presently to be conveyed to the Department by the Province.\n\nSo far as the school is concerned, the title to the reserve is secure so long as it continues to be used for the purpose for which the grant was made, but it will be necessary at some time to purchase the subdivided portion, in order to protect the improvements of the Indians who have been encouraged to settle thereon.\n\n(sgd.) Geo. Patrick\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nAugust 13, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter No.156-0-9 dated July 8, 1936, in reference to Indians being located on the Special Industrial School Reserve at Alert Bay, I beg to herewith submit the following report on those Indians who have made application to reside on this reserve and whose application has been recommended by the Indian Agent and approved by the Department, as well as those Indians residing on this reserve without permission or authority from the Department. For the purpose of making a complete report, we are taking each lot separately as shown on Map No. 277 B.C., sub-division of Part of Indian Industrial School Reserve, Alert Bay, Cormorant Island, Rupert District, B.C., of which the Department no doubt have a copy.\n\nIn order to have the status of each lot brought up to date, we are requesting the Department to confirm all former approvals given by them, and recommending that all lots now held by various Indians through purchase, be approved and confirmed by the Department.\n\nLot No.1 - This lot is registered in the name of Stephen Cook, a member of the Nimipkish Band, who made application for the same as an ex-pupil of the Residential School, and was granted authority in Departmental letter dated September 14, 1914. This lot has been held by him ever since, and although at the present time he is not living thereon, it is nevertheless recognized as his property and he is holding it for one of his sons.\n\nI would recommend that the approval granted by the Department on September 14, 1914, be confirmed, and a certificate to this effect issued.\n\nLot No.2 - This lot was applied for by Charles Newman, an Indian of the Kwawkewlth Band, and his application approved by the Department on September 14, 1914. He has now transferred his interests to his son, Carey Newman, of the Kwawkewlth Band, who is now living on this property.\n\nI would request the Department's approval of this transfer from Charles Newman to Carey Newman, and would recommend that a certificate be issued to Carey Newman.\n\nLot No.3 - This lot was granted to Chief Joseph Harris of the Nimipkish Band by Departmental letter of September 14, 1914, and he is still residing thereon. I would therefore recommend that the Department issue a certificate confirming this approval to Chief Joseph Harris.\n\nLot No.4 - Annie Kamano was the original owner of this lot by authority in Departmental letter of September 14, 1914. She sold her interests, and the improvements on this property have changed hands many times, and the present owner is Benjamin Brotchie, ex pupil, and member of the Kwawkewlth Band, but there is no record of his location having been approved by the Department. As he intends to keep his home on this property, I would recommend that the Department approve of his location on this lot, and issue a certificate approving of same to him.\nLot No.5 - This is one case where it would appear the Department has given no permission to settle and where Indians have apparently squatted without the approval of the Department. From old-time Indians we have learned in regard to Lot No.5 that Richard Fiddler, member of the Mamalilikulla Band and ex-pupil of the Residential School, built a small house on this lot, later selling it to an Indian lady by the name of Lily of the Klowitais Band. This Indian has now disposed of her interests to Herbert Cook of the Nimpkish Band, who has improved the property and is making his home there.\n\nIn this case I would recommend that the Department approve of Herbert Cook's location on this lot, and issue a certificate to this effect to him.\n\nLot No.6 - An application from Michael Kamano, white, was forwarded to the Department on March 1st, 1921 for this lot, and the Department later approved of his location in a letter dated March 11th, 1921. At the time his application was forwarded a special covering letter was enclosed explaining this application, which was later approved by the Department.\n\nThis lot has changed hands through the sale of the improvements, and is now owned and occupied by Charles Newman, Indian of the Kwawkewlth Band, an ex-pupil of the Residential School, and I would recommend that the Department approve of Charles Newman as owner of this lot and issue a certificate to him to that effect.\n\nOn this same lot there is another small house built which is partially located on Lot 6 and partially on the street known as Hill Street. This house was originally built by Spruce Martin, member of the Kwawkewlth Band whose children are all ex-pupils of the Residential School. He has returned to his own village at Fort Rupert and the house is occupied by Charlie James, a member of the Kwawkewlth Band who is the step-father of Spruce Martin.\n\nIn connection with this house, I would recommend that it be moved back to a position on the back end of Lot 6 so that it will be entirely on this lot as there is plenty of room for a house at the back end of this lot.\n\nOn Street Allowance Between Lots 6 and 7 - Gideon Whonnock, ex-pupil of the Residential School, has built a home on Hill Street, fronting on Front Street, between Lots 6 and 7. No approval was given to him for the erection of this house as far as our records show, but as the back portion of this street leading to Broughton Street is a very steep grade and in my opinion would not be used as a street, I would recommend that this portion of Hill Street be transferred from a thoroughfare to a lot, calling the front portion if it Lot No. 6A, and the upper or back half Lot No. 6B, and granting the front portion of it to Whonnock where he has already settled. It will never be used for street purposes, and the lots to the rear can be reached more satisfactorily by way of Park and Broughton Streets. A special letter in this connection is being forwarded on behalf of Whonnock, making this recommendation.\n\nLot No.7 - This lot was applied for by James Prevost, Indian of the Nimpkish Band, and granted to him by Departmental letter of September 14th, 1914. It is still held by him and he has lived for many years in his home erected on this location. I would recommend that the Department at this time confirm the approval given to James Prevost as to his location on this lot.\nLot No.8 - This lot was allotted to David Shaughnessy, Indian of the Tsawataineuk Band, an ex-pupil of the Residential School and he was notified under date of January 9, 1920 by the then Indian Agent, Mr. W.M. Halliday, but we cannot locate in our files where the Department approved of this although no doubt their approval had been received as Mr. Halliday states he \"had been instructed by the Department to issue this approval\". Mr. Shaughnessy has lived on this property ever since, has improved it greatly, and during the past year has built another home on the back of the lot for his son.\n\nI would therefore recommend that the Department issue a certificate of approval granting this lot to David Shaughnessy.\n\nLot No.9 - This lot was granted to William Brotchie by Departmental letter dated September 14, 1914. He is now deceased but he had sold his interest and the improvements on this property to Thomas Nowell who is now also deceased. Before Thomas Nowell died, he left the improvements on this lot jointly to his daughter Dorothy Nowell and his step-son Bertie Blenkinsop, both of the Kwawkewlth Band, and the property remains today in their names. Since then Dorothy Nowell has married an Indian by the name of Ben Isaac who belongs to the Katzle Band of the New Westminster Band, and they have made their home here most of the time since they were married as Mrs. Isaac was caring for her mother who had been kept by Bertie Blenkinsop her half-brother, and part owner of the property. Bertie always made his home here, and has kept the property in repair. Both these owners of this lot are ex-pupils of the Residential School, but as Ben Isaac, husband of the former Dorothy Nowell is not a desirable resident in this Agency, it is my desire to have him moved back to his own Agency. A special letter is being forwarded the Department in regard to this particular case, but I would recommend that Bertie Blenkinsop purchase Mrs. Ben Isaac's interest from her, and that a certificate be issued to Bertie Blenkinsop at the time of transfer.\n\nLot No.10 - I am advised by Mr. Anfield, Principal of the Alert Bay Residential School, that this lot has been transferred to the school property and that it no longer belongs to the sub-division of the Industrial School Reserve, but has been cleared and a residence built on it for the engineer of the Residential School, therefore it is not available for residential purposes as far as this Special Reserve is concerned.\n\nAs we have no particulars in regard to this, would the Department kindly advise me the date on which this lot was transferred and any other particulars pertaining to the transfer.\n\nLot No.11 - Arthur Stanley, an ex-pupil of the Residential School but who has always been classed as white, was granted this lot and approved by the Department in their letter of September 19, 1922. The covering letter at the time of his application gives a full explanation why this was approved. Arthur Stanley owned this house on this lot until recently when he sold it for cash to Moses Alfred, an Indian of the Nimpkish Band and an ex-pupil of the school, who is now the present owner.\n\nI would recommend that the Department issue a certificate of approval to Moses Alfred for his ownership of this lot.\n\nLot No.12 - No approval was given by the Department as far as our records show to Mrs. William Brotchie, ex-pupil, who built a home on this lot and greatly improved it. About a year ago after Mr. Brotchie died, Mrs. Brotchie sold the house to Godfrey Hunt, an ex-pupil a member of the Kwawkewlth Band, who owns it at the present time and is living thereon. I would therefore recommend that the Department issue a certificate of approval to Godfrey Hunt for his ownership of this lot.\nLots 13 to 19 are vacant, and no application is on file or any approval granted for any of them.\n\nLot No. 20 - Price Bruce, an Indian of the Matilpi Band, and ex-pupil of the Residential School, has built a house and done certain improvements on this lot, but we cannot find where any approval was given by the Department for his location, however there is a possibility that the then Indian Agent gave him permission to build there. He is making his home on this lot at the present time, and I would recommend that the Department approve of Price Bruce's location on this lot and issue a certificate accordingly.\n\nLots No. 21 to 40 - the remainder of the lots in this subdivision are unoccupied with no improvements made and no applications on file for occupation.\n\nAs no doubt the Department have a copy of Survey and Plan No. 277 B.C. as surveyed by F.M. Leach under date of June 13, 1915 which gives full particulars as to the amount of land in each lot, with the further information given in this report as to the lots located upon, the Department will be able to arrive at the amount of land occupied and by whom, and the amount still untenanted and available for residential purposes.\n\nAs we are anxious to get this situation straightened out satisfactorily, would the Department please give it their early consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

The question of issuing location tickets to the Indian locators was then brought up and it being decided that the reserve was set apart for a special purpose and not an Indian reserve or a special reserve within the meaning of the Indian Act, the Department could not issue location tickets.\n\nThe Department endeavoured to obtain title to the land from the Province, but were unsuccessful, the decision expressed by the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works being,- \"that owing to the unsatisfactory state of affairs between the Dominion and the Province in relation to the question of Indian reserves, the Executive considers it inadvisable in the meantime to make further allotments, but will be prepared to consider any application by the Department for purchase, or deal with suitable exchanges.\" Here the question was dropped.

W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe road referred to in your memorandum of the 3rd April, your file 2315-29, runs through the subdivided part of the Alert Bay Industrial School property on Cormorant Island. The title to the whole of this parcel is unsettled. A search has been made to try to prove that this school reserve occupies the same ground as parcel number 68 mentioned in a list of Military and Naval reserves supplied by the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch of this Department, a copy of which I believe is of record on one of your files. We are convinced that the parcels do overlap but proof is lacking due to the fact that the plans have been sent to Mr. Taggart care of the Deputy Minister of Lands, Victoria. These gentlemen are a commission to determine the locations of these Military reserves (commonly called Ordnance Lands).\n\nThe cemetery lies immediately east of the subdivided portion of the school property and not on the school reserve, nor is the cemetery on an Indian reserve. We believe it is on land formerly held privately and was a part of lot 4. The location of the road to it, shown on the blue print on file which is from our plan Rd. 2723, was approved by this department in 1957 and the province was authorized to enter the reserve for purposes of construction. The road allowance was not transferred to the province. It is understood by our Department that the Dominion Government owns the land through which the road passes and over which the road runs, but it is not clear whether it is a Military reserve or an Industrial School reserve.\nUnder the circumstances, it would not appear to be practicable to use Indian funds for the construction of the road, but a government grant might be considered, as no doubt the Indians do to a small extent use this road. The Indians have a burial ground called No. 2 or Nimipkish band situate about 30 chains south of the Indian reserve. The Indian reserve is immediately south of lot 4 and the Industrial School lot is immediately west of lot 4, so that it appears doubtful that the Indians make much use of the cemetery to which the road runs.\n\nSgd.

The Department concurs in your recommendation of his occupation.\n\nAs Lot 3 is occupied by Chief Joseph Harris I advise that the Department approves of your recommendation in connection with this location.\n\nAs Benjamin Brotchie occupies Lot 4 at the present time the Department also approves of your recommendation in connection with this lot. I have endeavoured to locate the recommendation of the Department in connection with Lot 5 but so far have not found the correspondence. I feel assured, however, that the then Agent must have had Departmental approval before he located Richard Flanders on the lot. As Flanders transferred his interest to Herbert Cook the Department approves of his occupation.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nBritish Columbia.\nIn connection with Lot 6, which appears to have changed hands many times, and is now owned and occupied by Charles Newman, I would point out that the Department approves of Mr. Newman's occupation. The Department also approves of your recommendation that the house should be moved back to a position on the north end of the lot. The street allowance between Lots 6 and 7 was dealt with in our letter of January 21st.\n\nThe Department confirms the approval previously given, in connection with James Prevost occupying Lot 7.\n\nThe Department approves of David Shaughnessy occupying Lot 8.\n\nLot 9 was dealt with in our letter of February 17th.\n\nI am unable to locate any record in connection with the transfer of Lot 10 as school property, and possibly Mr. Anfield may be able to furnish you with a record showing the Department's approval.\n\nThe Department approves of Moses Alfred occupying Lot 11. I am unable to locate any reference to Lot 12 in our correspondence but assume that Mr. Holiday must have received authority to locate Mrs. William Brotchie on this lot. In view of the transfer of the property to Godfrey Hunt and your recommendation in the matter the Department approves of his occupation.\n\nThe Department approves of Price Bruse occupying Lot 20 as you report that he has made certain improvements and erected a house thereon, and recommend issue of certificate.\n\nI trust that this information will be satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.R.L.

Sharp of Alert Bay to lease a portion of the foreshore of the Industrial School Reserve, I may say that some time ago Mr. M.S. Todd advised the Department that Herbert Cook, owner of the southeast portion of Lot 1 of the said location was prepared to lease the foreshore immediately in front of his property adjoining Front and Boundary Streets.\n\nI do not think that the Department could issue such a lease without the consent of the Province as the Province years ago agreed not to lease any foreshore in front of an Indian reserve without the consent of the Dominion. In view of the decision it is thought that a joint lease might be prepared and submitted to the Province through our Indian Commissioner at Victoria.\n\nI shall see that immediate action is taken in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Jackson,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Captain Jackson:\n\nJ.R. Sharpe of Alert Bay wires me and writes me that he applied on April 15th for a lease on the foreshore of the Industrial Reserve, Alert Bay for the purpose of building a marine ways and boat building industry. He says he is being seriously embarrassed by not getting any action and the application was made through the Indian Agent, who is doing all he can. He further says he is willing to sign a lease, etc., and would like to get a permit to enter the foreshore and establish his business on the foreshore which has been agreed to by the Indians and Mr. Todd.\n\nIt is not clear to me what he wants. Presumably he is trying to lease a piece of the Industrial Reserve, which if not a regular Indian Reserve, at least belongs to the Indian Department. If that is the case, why not let him go ahead on the understanding that he will sign the regular lease. It would seem to me as if he would also need to get a lease of the foreshore from the Provincial Government, which, except for one or two public harbours, all belong to the Province. I don't suppose the fact that this Industrial Reserve belongs to the Dominion who give them any claim on the foreshore, except that it is customary when someone applies to the Provincial Government for a foreshore lease, to ask them to produce the consent of the riparian owners. Apparently he is in a desperate hurry, because he has had to move immediately from his previous location.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.W.

MacKay, Vancouver, recommending approval of this application as a necessary preliminary to the consent of the provincial authorities. Commissioner MacKay has been advised by letter that this approval is granted, and I presume, therefore, that there will now be no difficulty in obtaining the necessary consent from the Provincial Department of Lands.\n\nThe documents which accompanied your memorandum are returned herewith.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nFebruary 3rd, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 3rd, 1940, your File No. 114-6-5314, in reference to the application of Mr. J.R.

Neill called to see me a few days ago and left the attached file of correspondence in reference to a lease for some foreshore rights at the Industrial Reserve, Alert Bay. Have you any information on your files in regard to the matter? You will notice in Commissioner MacKay's letter he stated that he had recommended the Department should approve of the leasing of the foreshore area. Has any action been taken? Please return the enclosed correspondence with your reply.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nEnc.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to refer to my letter of November 18th, my file 114/2545, in the matter of an application of Herbert Cook to lease the foreshore at Alert Bay surveyed as Lot 1659 adjoining foreshore Lot 1574 under lease to the Church of England.\n\nThe Superintendent of Lands has again raised the question of Cook's application, pointing out that the consent of the Indian Affairs Branch is necessary before the provincial lease can be issued. I have already recommended favorable consideration of Cook's application, and should appreciate being advised as soon as possible of the Department's decision so that the Superintendent of Lands can be informed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 16th instant regarding the application of Herbert Cook to lease a part of the foreshore of the Industrial School Reserve at Alert Bay, I would advise that further information has come to hand re the alleged encroachment of Mr. Cook's application, surveyed as Lot 1659, on the Anglican Synod lease, surveyed as Lot 1574, and as the latter is very much prior to the former and in good standing with the Provincial Department of Lands at the time of the Cook application, it is my opinion that the Cook lease should be subject to the prior rights of the Synod lease and not cover any ground occupied by the latter. I would therefore recommend that Mr. Cook's application be approved subject to any existing rights at the time of his application.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nApplication has been received from Herbert Cook, Indian of the Nimpkish Band, now resident on Lot 1, subdivision of the Industrial School Reserve, to lease from the Province of British Columbia a part of the foreshore adjacent to this property, the intention being to sublet it to a white person, James Sharpe, as outlined in Mr. Agent Todd's letter to you of February 2nd, 1939, but more particularly described in the copy of the application herewith. The area has been surveyed and was found to conflict to some extent with an adjoining foreshore lease as shown on enclosed sketch. It is the intention of Mr. Sharpe to use the property for a marine ways. Apparently the Department has to give consent to Herbert Cook's application to lease this foreshore and if this is in order it is recommended for approval, after which Mr. Sharpe's application will receive consideration. The encroachment shown on the sketch was taken up with Mr. Todd on September 13th and I am awaiting his reply.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

Anfield, Esq.,\nPrincipal, St. Michael's School,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Anfield:\n\nThe North-West Telephone Company wishes to apply for permission to use the transmitter site which was discussed with you and Mr. Todd on Mr. Tupper's visit to Alert Bay last week. A map is attached showing the proposed site in detail.\n\nIt is proposed to erect three wooden 50-ft. poles for an antenna system, and a small frame building to house the new radio transmitter. The power and telephone facilities will be extended around the back of the Preventorium to this location.\n\nOnce the equipment is installed, it will be remotely controlled from the Telegraph Office. It will be necessary, of course, for our staff to make periodic inspections of the equipment every three or four months.\n\nAfter a thorough investigation this was found to be the only site which met all the requirements for a station of this type. For maximum efficiency a location should be chosen which has a clear unobstructed view in the direction of Vancouver. As the island is for the most part heavily wooded with steep hillsides, this is the only readily accessible point which meets these requirements.\n\nIt is very unlikely that this equipment will interfere with the broadcast receiving sets used by the School; but if any interference arises, this company will guarantee to eliminate it to your satisfaction.\n\nWith regard to possible danger to the children, the power service will be 3 phase 220 volt which, of course, is already on the school property; and the line will be constructed to conform to standard practices. The antenna will be made from heavy duty telephone material and set well above the ground, and will carry no dangerous voltages. A small shatter-proof glass window with a heavy mesh screen and a double locked door should eliminate the possibility of the children entering the building.\n\nThe North-West Telephone Company would pay $50.00 a year for the use of this property. It is felt that this is a reasonable amount for the use of this property as it is on a side hill and unsuitable for agricultural purposes.\n\nIt is believed that all the details discussed by Mr. Tupper, our Radio Engineer, with yourself and Mr. Todd have been outlined above, and if this proposal meets with your approval we would appreciate any action you might take to expedite the agreement in that we wish to improve the telephone service to the Alert Bay community as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) \"C.B.

C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd,\n\nAttached please find application from the North-West Telephone Company for permission to use the transmitter site discussed with you on Mr. Tupper's recent visit to Alert Bay. Two maps are attached hereto.\n\nAs this is a matter which must be decided by the Department, it will be better if you will proceed with the necessary correspondence from your office. As far as I know, there is no objection to this installation so far as the school is concerned, although, if the Department considers it necessary I would take the matter up with the Commission and secure a final consent, or otherwise.\n\nThe only point in connection with this matter which has occurred to me since the visit of Mr. Tupper and your telephone conversation regarding same, is whether the construction of such a transmitter on the school reserve would not infringe upon the Crown Grant of this property from the Province to the Department. It is my understanding that such Crown Grant was made only and solely for the purpose of Indian education. This may, however, be a technical point only, but it seemed to me worth mentioning. The question of the rental could be left to the Department to settle, as far as we are concerned.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nEncls.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\n14th June, 1940.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find application from the North-West Telephone Company for permission to use a transmitter site on the Residential School property, which has been submitted to Mr. Anfield for transmission to this office for the Department's attention.\n\nThe letter from the Telephone Company will be self-explanatory, and the blueprints attached will indicate the location desired by them.\n\nFor the Department's information, a representative of the North-West Telephone Company interviewed me some time ago and pointed out this was the only suitable location they could find in Alert Bay for this site, and asked that I forward their application to the Department for consideration. At that time I pointed out to Mr. Turner, doubted whether the Department would consider granting this site for various reasons, and that I myself was not particularly in favour of it on account of so many children playing around and the possibility of accidents. Mr. Turner assured me however that precautions would be taken, but I am still of the same opinion although I decline to recommend against it when they state this is the only suitable location they can find.\n\nThere is one point which I am not clear on, and that is the status of the school property between the province and the Dominion, and I would not care to have anything take place which would infringe upon the Crown Grant of this property.\n\nThe application is going forward and will be left entirely in the Department's hands to be dealt with as I do not feel justified in making a recommendation one way or the other. Would the Department kindly deal with the matter as they see fit, and advise me accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.S. Todd\nIndian Agent\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\nMemorandum to: P. Phelan, Esq.,\nWelfare and Training Division.\n\nWith reference to the letter hereunder from Indian Commissioner D.M. MacKay, Vancouver, B.C., this service can see no objection to the proposal being carried out. You probably should communicate with the church commission and ascertain whether or not there is any objection from their viewpoint. Should they be agreeable the writer can see no reason why the Director could not issue a permit to occupy the land required to the North-West Telephone Company. As it is apparent that the church is interested I would suggest that they should be first consulted.\n\nD.J. Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves and Trusts.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJune 27th, 1940.\n\nSir,\n\nI have just been informed by Indian Commissioner D.M. MacKay in his letter of June 24th, 1940, No.33-6-6317, that title of the Industrial School Reserve, Alert Bay has been transferred to the Dominion Government as ordinary Indian Reserve by Provincial Order-in-Council No. 821, approved June 21st, 1939.\n\nAs the Department is aware, there is a sub-division of this Industrial School Reserve occupied by individual Indians, and it would now appear that the Department would be in a position to issue location tickets direct to each Indian lot holder. If this is correct, would the Department kindly advise me and I will forward a list of the various Indians holding lots with the approval of the Department for which we have not been able to date to issue location tickets owing to the title being held by the Provincial Government.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the Department would write me fully giving me all the particulars and information they can as to the status of this Reserve and what relationship now exists between the Dominion Government and the M.S.C.C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe North-West Telephone Company has applied for a transmitter site on the open slope to the west of the playing field of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. A white print is attached indicating the location desired by the Company for the transmitting station and the necessary poles and anchors. Copies of correspondence relating to the application are enclosed.\n\nMr. Anfield points out that there is no objection to the proposed installation as far as the school is concerned, but suggests that the Church Commission might be approached in the matter should the Department consider such action necessary. The title to this Reserve is identical to that of the other Reserves conveyed to the Dominion by the Province so that the point raised by Mr. Todd of possible infringement is not applicable in this case.\n\nPersonally I can see no objection to the application provided the necessary safeguards were furnished as required by the Department after consulting the Agent and the Principal of the school. Should the Department be disposed to approve of the application, a permit to occupy at the pleasure of the Department would probably meet the case.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 8, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter dated the 27th June requesting to be advised as to the status of Alert Bay Indian Industrial School Reserve which was transferred to the Dominion Government by the Province of British Columbia by Order in Council No. 621, dated 21st June, 1939, and in reply I wish to state that in all respects the status of this Reserve is the same as that of all other Reserves in British Columbia outside of the area of the former Railway Belt and transferred to the Dominion Government by the Province of British Columbia by Order in Council No. 1036, dated the 29th July, 1936.\n\nThis Reserve is, therefore, subject to those provisions as set out in Order in Council No. 1036 which apply to all other Reserves in British Columbia.\n\nWith the passing of this Order in Council this Department is now in a position to deal with the matter of allocation of the various lots shown on the plan of survey that was made some years ago and can now issue location tickets covering such lots and we will be glad to have you forward a list of those entitled to the various lots, when consideration will be given to the issuing of the required location tickets.\n\nThe matter of the relationship between the Dominion Government and the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada will be dealt with in a separate letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nD.

I am making this recommendation as I realize how difficult it is to obtain money for this institution, and as the transmitter site is adjacent to same, I consider the revenue could be best spent for that purpose when it is necessary that certain work each year will be required.\n\nWould the Department please advise me whether this is approved?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

Hutchinson (Manual Training Instructor at our Alert Bay School) who desired to be married, and for whom no accommodation was available; the completed building will furnish additional accommodation for patients whenever such is required, should Mr. and Mrs. Hutchinson retire from the service.\n\nYour sympathetic consideration of our request for reimbursement of the amount expended and in the way I have suggested, will be fully appreciated.\n\nVery kind regards,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOctober 7, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of October 1st, your file 156-0-9B, regarding an application by the North-West Telephone Company for a lease to certain lands of the Indian School Reserve at Alert Bay.\n\nA white print of the area desired by the Company was forwarded to the Department with my letter of June 6, my file 33/6/6344, and the necessary permission to use the lands required by the Company was granted by the Department in an un-numbered letter signed by Dr. McGill, dated July 22nd, 1940. In case the Department can not locate the white print referred to, I have asked the Company to furnish me with another copy for your files.\n\nPerhaps I should add that Mr. Indian Agent Todd was requested on August 19th to forward the annual rental\u2014$50.00\u2014received from the North-West Telephone Company for the lands concerned, direct to the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nFollowing telephone conversation with Mr. Fee of your office, enclosed as requested is cheque No. 921 dated Aug. 16th 1941 in favour of the Receiver General of Canada for the sum of $50.00, received here from the North-West Telephone Company, Vancouver, B.C., in payment for 1941-42 rental of a transmitter site at Alert Bay, B.C. leased from your Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF. O. Weeks\nTreasury Officer\n\nThe Chief Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nBooth Bldg.,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nMay 26, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Subdivided Lands on Cormorant Island adjacent to the Alert Bay Indian School.\n\nYour letter of April 30th, 1941, in which you ask for approval of allocations to various Indians on Cormorant Island, has resulted in a more complete examination of this whole problem.\n\nThe writer is embarrassed in the matter due to the fact that under date of April 15th you were advised that Edwin Cook might be located to Lot No. 19 in the subdivision, and on July 8th, 1940, that with the passing of the Order-in-Council confirming ownership in His Majesty the King in the Right of Canada it was intimated that location tickets might be issued. There are probably other instances where the writer has encouraged you to believe that locations might be granted on Cormorant Island.\n\nWe have now run into administrative difficulties. If you will consult Section 21 of the Indian Act you will note that it provides that no one shall be deemed to be lawfully in possession of any land on a reserve unless he has been, or is, located for the same by the band, or the council of the band, with the approval of the Superintendent General. It is obvious that the provisions imposed by this section cannot be implemented in the case of Cormorant Island, and it is not possible, therefore, to locate Indians to the subdivision lands.\n\nCormorant Island according to the title belongs to all the Indians of British Columbia. We can see no way, therefore, in which we can legally transfer ownership in any part of it to any individual Indian. Should we attempt to do so we would be creating a new Indian band recruited from Indians who already have band membership in their band of origin and giving them title to land to which as individuals they have no possible claim. The matter has been very\n\nM.S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\ncarefully considered departmentally and the suggestion is being entertained that the Cormorant Island lands adjacent to the Alert Bay School should be regarded as Indian property used in conjunction with the school. As the school itself is presumably operated for the general benefit of the Indians of British Columbia this would not be an inconsistent view to take. Should the school administration wish to use these lands as a field for a sort of extension course possibly graduates of the school could possess and use them on a permit basis during pleasure of the Superintendent General. Those capable of serving as an example to succeeding crops of pupils could be permitted to remain so long as they performed that function. On the other hand if they did not make good and ceased to be a source of inspiration to the pupils in the school they could be returned to their band of origin and their places taken by others.\n\nThe writer has been charged by the Director with the task of finding a solution to this problem of land holding on Cormorant Island. This letter will not go forward to you until it has been considered by the Superintendent of Welfare and Training. No conclusion save that we cannot grant locations has been reached, and we would very much appreciate any observations with relation to these lands which you, or the principal of the school, or both of you, care to submit.\n\nA copy of this letter is going forward to the Commissioner for British Columbia for his consideration and for any comment which he may care to make in this matter which relates not exclusively to your own agency but to the Indians generally of your province. In order that Major MacKay may be fully informed it is suggested that your reply should be submitted through his office.\n\nThe writer again expresses regret that we may have started you on a false trail in this connection, but it does appear wise that the situation should be faced before it becomes even more complicated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.J. Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves and Trusts.\nMemorandum to: The Director.\n\nRe Alert Bay Industrial School,\notherwise known as Cormorant Island Indian Reserve.\n\nThis Indian reserve consisting of .......... acres, and in part occupied by the Alert Bay Industrial School, was conveyed from the Crown Provincial to the Crown Dominion by Order-in-Council 1036, dated 29th July, 1938.\n\nThe writer's information is that it is held in common to all the bands of British Columbia.\n\nIt appears that dating back some years, possibly to 1904, ex-students or graduates from the Alert Bay Industrial School have been encouraged to take up and settle on allotments in the Cormorant Island Reserve. It in fact appears that 61 acres was surveyed and laid out in sub-division lots for this express purpose. Recent applications have been made by Indian Agent Todd to actually locate Indians to these sub-division lots.\n\nWe immediately run into difficulties by reason of Section 21 of the Indian Act which, as you will recall, provides that no one shall be deemed to be lawfully in possession of any land in a reserve unless he has been, or is, located for the same by the band, or the council of the band, with the approval of the Superintendent General. As the provisions imposed by the section cannot be implemented it is not possible to issue location tickets.\n\nIt is suggested in Mr. Taggart's memorandum hereunder that the provisions of Section 21 and related sections might be avoided if His Excellency in Council were to proclaim Section 21 of the Act inoperative insofar as Cormorant Island Indian Reserve is concerned. Even were this done, however, it would only have the effect of rendering the present provisions of the Act relating to the issue of location tickets inoperative and would substitute no alternative procedure under which location tickets might be issued.\n\nThis..........\nThis brings up the whole question as to whether or not it is expedient and desirable to give \"individual Indian title\" to an Indian covering lands which belong to all the Indians of British Columbia.\n\nThe writer is not aware or does not understand what Agent Todd's objective is in settling school graduates on little 8 acre patches of land at Cormorant Island presumably far from the communities of which such students are members. It would appear to follow that in doing so he is in effect setting up a new band recruited from the school population on land that belongs not to them, or to such new band, but to the Indians of British Columbia generally.\n\nOn the other hand it is suggested that if the settling of students on land adjacent to the residential school is in the nature of a post-graduate course in domestic economy it might be well to retain the land as part of the school equipment. As the school itself is presumably operated for the general benefit of the Indians of British Columbia the lands used expressly for the extension of the school's sphere of influence would fall into the same category of use for the general benefit of the Indians of British Columbia. This I think we can justify. I frankly do not think we can justify conveying an interest in this land to young Indians who presumably are members of bands elsewhere in the province.\n\nWith all respect the writer suggests that no location tickets be issued, and that the occupants be advised immediately that it is not proposed to give them location tickets or any other evidence of Indian title. If desirable to set up students on the Cormorant Island Indian Reserve might it not be well to confine it to a yearly permit. In this way undesirables could be sent back to their bands should they fail to make good, or in other words they would be retained on this reserve only so long as by their presence and hoped for success they were an object lesson and source of inspiration to succeeding graduating classes.\n\nGranting an Indian graduate of the school a location ticket would be the means of establishing him on Cormorant Island by legal process. On the other hand it might be argued that the test applicable to whether or not he remain on the island should be his proven capacity to maintain himself in such a manner as to be a source of inspiration to those who follow him to this school.\n\nIt is...........\nIt is suggested that the matter might be carefully considered. The writer confesses that he has not helped the situation much by signing a letter dated April 12th, 1941, advising the Agent that Indians may be registered as owners of the land. However on giving the matter more careful consideration I do not think he can be under the Act, and I do not think he should be as a matter of departmental policy.\n\nOur Files Nos. 156-0-9B, 15156-4, and 15156-5, are submitted with this memorandum for consideration.\n\nD.J. Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves and Trusts.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Allan\n\nRe: Cormorant Island Indian Reserve,\nAlert Bay Industrial School,\nLot No. 1957, Runert District, B.C.\n\nAlthough this area is used as an Industrial School site, it is, in reality, a regular Indian Reserve of the same status as any other Indian Reserve in British Columbia, for by the terms of Provincial Order in Council 821, 21st June, 1939, which transferred title from the Province to the Dominion, it is subject to the same provisions as the majority of British Columbia Indian Reserves conveyed from the Crown Provincial to the Crown Dominion by Order in Council 1036, 29th July, 1938.\n\nSo far it has not been allotted to any particular Band, but is said to be common to all Bands in British Columbia.\n\nAs outlined in Mr. Brown's memorandum hereunder, the question of allotment of parcels of land to ex-students of the School dates back to 1904, when application for approval was made, but this was eventually held up awaiting the clearance of the title.\n\nYou raise the question of authority by which such allotment may be made. It seems to the writer that this Reserve is in the same category as a few others in British Columbia; for instance Poplar Island, which was conveyed from the Province to the Dominion by Order in Council 1036 and is held in common for tribes in the Fraser River Valley; and the Lots in the city of New Westminster, which were set aside in the same manner and which are administered absolutely from Head Office with no reference to any group of Indians. Another such case\nsomewhat similar is Hamilton Island (although this property is owned by one Band by special legislation) but it would appear that the same principle applied.\n\nHowever, it is evident that by provisions of the Indian Act, once this land became an Indian Reserve as defined by the provisions of the Act, it is subject to the provision of Clause 21 with respect to allotments or location tickets, unless the provision of Clause 3 has been or is to be invoked, in which case the Superintendent General would become in supreme control.\n\nIn the case in point it would seem desirable to have this Reserve removed from the control of any particular Band and placed in full control of the Superintendent General by proclamation, through the medium of an Order in Council.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Allan,\n\nre Subdivision of Industrial School Reserve, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nIn 1891 the Provincial Government of British Columbia set apart as a reserve 410 acres on Cormorant Island, B.C., designated as the Alert Bay Industrial Reserve.\n\nIn 1904 the Agent requested a portion of the land be subdivided and allotted to certain ex-pupils of the school who had been permitted by the former Agent to settle on a portion of the property. The request was approved and a subdivision of 61 acres was laid out by survey. The question of issuing location tickets was brought up but it was decided the reserve was not an Indian reserve within the meaning of the Act as the title was in the Province not in the Dominion. In consequence although Indians have been located to lots since that date such location has been by approval only.\n\nHowever on June 21st, 1939 title to the said Reserve was conveyed by Provincial Order-in-Council to the Dominion Government and when the Agent subsequently inquired re the issue of location tickets you advised him under letter of July 8th, 1940, that the Department now had the authority to do so and that if he would forward a list of...\nlist of the Indians located with Departmental approval we would consider the issue of tickets.\n\nThe matter has not progressed further, but recently we received requests for Departmental approval of locations to two young Indians. Do you wish me to take steps to start the location ticket system on this subdivision or did something (which doesn't appear on file) hold up the whole question?\n\nLB.\nOctober 15, 1940.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour File 156-0-9B.\n\nWith further reference to your letter of October 1st, I am forwarding herewith a linen print received from the North-west Telephone Company showing the approximate position of the transmission station, poles and anchors, all of which appear to be within the area used for school purposes.\n\nThe location of these points has not been determined by proper survey but the Department may not consider such a survey necessary in this case.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

By the time the work outlined is completed, a sum exceeding $100.00 will have been spent on materials alone. It should be mentioned that included in this amount is an item for a new hot water system, which has not been installed and is giving excellent service.\n\nYou will recall your recommendation to the Department that the sum of $50.00 be paid as rent by The North West Telephone Company, but allocated to maintenance expenditure at this unit. Would you be good enough to approach the Department and ask them if they are prepared to allow the first year's rent to be placed in use for labour on the work now being undertaken.\n\nIf this could be secured, it would be a very great help to our Commission who this year at the School and the Preventorium have spent several hundred dollars of School funds in maintenance work of all kinds.\n\nThanking you,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nFEA/M Principal\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\n22nd September 1941\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department will recall the North-West Telephone Company are using, by arrangement with the Department, a portion of the School property adjacent to the Preventorium for a transmitter site, and are paying us for this consideration annual rental of Fifty Dollars.\n\nWhen the first year's rental was forwarded the Department on August 28th 1940, I requested that this amount be placed in a Trust Account to be used for the upkeep of the Preventorium. As it is now necessary to do some interior decorating at this institution, I would request that the Department to permit this Fifty Dollars to be used for that purpose, and forward me an accountable cheque in that amount to be used entirely for labour in having this work done, same to be supported by pay-sheets.\n\nI enclose herewith copy of a letter received from Principal Anfield in connection with this work, and would appreciate if the Department would give it their immediate attention as we would like to have the decorating completed as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.

R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nMemorandum to: File.\n\nThe problem raised by correspondence on the attached file does not appear to have been settled. The facts would appear to be as follows:\n\n1. Cormorant Island and the Alert Bay Subdivision is the property of all the Indians of British Columbia and belongs to no particular band.\n\n2. The Act requires that Indians be \"located\" to land \"by the band or the council of the band\" with the approval of the Superintendent General (Section 21).\n\n3. As there is no band (the group at Alert Bay being made up of a collection of individuals who already are band members of existing and recognized bands) there can be no band or band council to locate these people; hence it would appear to follow that no location under the Act is possible. That point appears to be clear.\n\n4. From the above it would appear to follow that no Indian can acquire ownership (in the limited sense of Indian ownership under the Crown) to any land at Alert Bay.\n\nD.J.

Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nTelegraph Cove Mills which for many years has supplied the School with slabs for heating purposes has been practically taken over by the Airforce and we are having extreme difficulty in getting supplies of fuel for the School. These people had a contract with us for 600 cords per year, but on the present contract only 200 cords have been delivered, and we are down to less than 50 cords on hand.\n\nThis situation has been grievously accentuated by the present cold snap. The mill is closed down completely and they have utilized every available piece of fire wood to keep their lighting plant running. They can give us no assurance whatever of any further cordwood for some considerable time, if ever.\n\nWe are taking immediate steps to try and get a supply of coal, and we expect 50 tons this week-end, and a further 100 tons inside of a month. This should do us until June.\n\nImmediate steps must be taken to insure an adequate supply of fuel for the next School year 1943-44, and with the present coal situation it would appear to be essential that we put in a large supply of cordwood. There is an adequate supply of this on the School land, and I am planning to engage two Indians ex-pupils to cut 300 cords immediately.\n\nI would like you to make sure with the Department that there are no objections to the School supplying itself with wood from the School lands, which I now understand are gazetted as a regular Indian Reserve.\n\nI do not expect there will be much difficulty, but consider it wise to ask you to make sure of this to prevent any possible complications in the future. It is specifically understood that all wood cut will be solely for the use of the School and the Preventorium.\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n27th January, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nThe enclosed copy of correspondence has been received from Principal Anfield, and will be self-explanatory.\n\nI am aware of the difficulty Mr. Anfield is having in obtaining fuel for St. Michael's Indian Residential School, and would recommend that the Department give him a Permit, if necessary, to cut the 300 cords of wood on the School Reserve under the arrangements suggested in his application.\n\nAs this property has only been recently confirmed as a Reserve, I am just wondering about the status of the resources thereon insofar as they may affect the Provincial Government; possibly you would advise me if we will be required to pay the Provincial Government stumpage and royalty for any wood removed from this Reserve for this specific purpose. I might state there are quite a number of windfalls which will be used for the wood.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nSgd M.S. Todd\n\nM.S. Todd\nIndian Agent\n\n- COPY -\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter from Mr. Anfield requesting authority to cut 300 cords of wood from what he refers to as school land, together with a copy of Mr. Todd's letter of January 27th forwarding the application.\n\nBy Provincial Government Order-in-Council No. 821, approved June 21st, 1939, title to the land referred to was transferred to the Dominion Government. The Lot was designated No. 1957 and conveyed as an ordinary Reserve. The total area is 412 acres. My understanding is that the timber and other resources were included in the title in the same way as other Reserves. If this is correct, the timber would belong to the Indians of British Columbia and its disposal subject to the requirements of the timber regulations. Stumpage and royalty fees would be payable to the Department but not to the Province.\n\nThere would appear to be no objection to granting permission to Mr. Anfield to cut 300 cords of wood at the prevailing stumpage rate and on payment of royalty of 75\u00a2 per cord.\n\nD.

Todd, Indian Agent, together with copy of letter from Mr. Anfield, Principal of Alert Bay Industrial School, requesting permission to cut 300 cords of fuel wood on the school reserve to supply the St. Michael's School with necessary fuel.\n\nThe Principal's request has been favourably considered, and you may advise Indian Agent M. S. Todd, of Alert Bay, B. C., that he is authorized to issue a permit to Mr. Anfield in order that he may cut 300 cords of fuel wood from windfalls on the reserve\u2014dues to be collected at tariff rates, 75 cents per cord of 128 cubic feet, and forwarded to this office in the usual way.\n\nDirector.\nTIMBER PERMIT\n\nI hereby give unto Mr. H. E. an Indian of the St. Michael's School Band, permission to cut and remove from his location or from the reserve of his band, the following quantity of timber:\n\n300 cords of fuel wood (128 cubic feet)\n\non the Reserve, from the date hereof until the 30th day of April next, and no longer, subject to the payment of dues at tariff rates.\n\nThe purchaser of the timber cut under this permit is responsible for the payment of the dues at the rate shown hereunder.

As this Reserve, so far as I know, does not belong to any particular Band of Indians, but rather was set aside for the use of St. Michael's School, I would like to recommend that this revenue be ear-marked, placed in a suspension account and used for repairs to this school building.\n\nPossibly the department would advise me the disposition of the account so that I will know in future how to deal with it if any further remittances are made in respect to this Reserve.\n\nEncs.\n\nIndian Agent.\nTREASURY OFFICE\n\nOttawa, March 10th., 1944.\n\nMEMORANDUM: SUPT. OF RESERVES & TRUSTS.\n\nAlert Bay Industrial School Reserve.\n\nCormorant Island comprises the site of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School and the above tract of land consisting of 1/2 acres. When the Royal Commission on Indian Affairs for the Province of British Columbia were asked to declare this land an Indian Reserve, they replied, - \"Inasmuch as the tract of land comprised in the Industrial School Reserve at Alert Bay was alienated by the Province of British Columbia and subsequently acquired by the Government of the Dominion of Canada for a school reserve, the Commission has no authority to constitute or confirm the whole or any portion thereto as an Indian Reserve under the terms of the Agreement.\"\n\nSchool Reserves vested in the Dominion are usually considered as land set aside for school purposes rather than an Indian Reserve and prior to 1939 the file indicates the above Reserve was considered as such. Provincial Order-in-Council No. 621 dated June 21, 1939, transferred the title of the above Reserve from the Province to the Dominion. The words of this document which reads, - \"conveyed to His Majesty the King in the right of the Dominion of Canada in trust for the use and benefit of the Indians of the Province of British Columbia\" seems to have the effect of changing the status of this tract of land. It did not appear in the Schedule of Indian Reserves prior to the date of this Provincial Order-in-Council, but since that has been listed as Alert Bay Industrial School Reserve.\n\nLast month we derived some revenue from this property in the form of wood dues and the status or ownership of the Reserve will determine the disposal of these funds. Proceeds from a School Reserve would naturally be placed in ordinary Revenue, but if it is an Indian Reserve belonging to all the Indians in British Columbia, I consider a special --\na special account would have to be opened. Immediately the question of expenditure comes up and the question of authority and fairness of disposing of these funds looms up as an administrative difficulty. May I suggest that we have a ruling (if you consider necessary from the legal office) as to the disposal of this revenue.\n\nWe have no Trust Fund Account set up which is owned in common by all the Indian Bands in British Columbia. I might here refer to the regulations provided by Order-in-Council P.C. 7282 in connection with the sale of \"Out-offs\" in that Province which stipulated that 50% of the proceeds therefrom shall belong to all the Indians in British Columbia, but a Departmental ruling to the contrary prevailed.\n\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nJHF/D.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Chief Treasury Officer,\n\nI wish to refer to your memorandum of March 10th regarding the revenue received from the sale of wood from the Alert Bay Indian Industrial School Reserve.\n\nThe land which comprises this Reserve was transferred to the Dominion of Canada to be held in trust for the use and benefit of the Indians of British Columbia, by Order in Council dated June 21, 1939. In view of this fact, I would suggest that the revenue be credited to a special account and when we are advised as to the number of the account we shall instruct the Agent that the funds are to be expended on improvements such as fencing and drainage, etc.\n\nD. J. Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves and Trusts.\nOttawa, March 31, 1946.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq., Indian Agent, Alert Bay, B. C.\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of February 19th last, with which you enclosed a remittance of $150.00 covering dues on fuel wood removed from the Alert Bay Industrial School Reserve. The funds have been credited to Suspense Account No. 78 for the present.\n\nIn view of the fact that this Reserve does not belong to any particular Band, but was set aside for the use of the Indians of British Columbia, it is suggested that the $150.00 be expended for improvements on the land, such as fencing, drainage or any other improvements you consider necessary, but not for repairs to the school buildings. The expenditure should be made at the earliest possible date in order that the funds might be paid out of the suspense account which is, as you know, merely a temporary holding account.\n\nD. J.

It is not considered advisable to grant a permit to prospect this area.\n\nWhen prospecting outside the area has definitely established coal in quantity in the school site, an application to lease a small portion of the site for production would be considered, provided that the work did not interfere with the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector\nAlert Bay, B.

C., from July 22, 1944 to July 22, 1945.\n\nIn former years this rental has been returned to the Agency and used for repairs to the Preventorium. Recently I have inspected the Preventorium and find it requires further decorating done in the interests of the health of the patients in that institution. I would appreciate if the department would approve of having this money used for that purpose, and forward me an accountable cheque for this amount. Statements will be forwarded at the conclusion of the work.\n\nThis is one means we have of keeping this building up and I would strongly recommend that the department agree to it.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJuly 11th, 1944.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nThis is to acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 27th last, file #156-0-3B, enclosing copy of a letter received from Mr. Edward Hodgson of 1032 Balmoral Road, Victoria, B.C., in which he is making application to drill for coal on Industrial School Site, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nAs the status of this Reserve has never been defined in every particular, it is difficult for me to make a satisfactory recommendation in respect to the above. I should like to have the following information: If a permit is issued and results in the operation of a coal mine on this School Property by some interest, what portion of the revenue will our department obtain and whom will it benefit.\n\nAs I understand it, the situation now is that this Reserve is treated as an ordinary Indian Reserve and is the property of all the Indians of British Columbia. If this is correct and the Indians are entitled to the revenue therefrom, in what way are we going to be able to make a distribution of this to them.\n\nIn my opinion, any such revenue coming off the School Property should be set aside in a special account to be used only for improvements on the land and buildings located on the School Reserve, but not to take in any Indians' homes located on the sub-division. By doing this we might eventually make the school self-maintained insomuch as expenditures in respect to improvements are concerned.\n\nOn the other hand, if the drilling for coal and the possible operation of a coal mine were to interfere with the life of the School in any way whatsoever, I would be opposed to it. It, therefore, seems that before any intelligent re-\n\np.t.o.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJune 23rd, 1944.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nThe enclosed agreement between Godfrey Hunt of the Kwawkewlth Band and Mrs. David Shaughnessy of the Tsawatineuk Band, both of this Agency, is being forwarded Ottawa with the recommendation that the sale and transfer of this property be approved.\n\nFor the department's information, Mrs. David Shaughnessy has purchased this property for her youngest son, who has just recently been married. It is their intention to improve the property and make this their permanent home. Later on the son will be taking it over from his Mother when he has sufficient funds to pay for same.\n\nI would appreciate if the department would kindly approve and have the original and one copy returned to this office for our files.\n\n(M.S.

Lawson of Alert Bay, British Columbia, presently operating in adjacent areas, to cut the said stand of timber at a stumpage and royalty rate of Three Dollars and seventy-five cents ($3.75) per thousand feet board measure, which offer is recommended for acceptance by the Indian Agent at Alert Bay and the Indian Commissioner for British Columbia.\n\nThe Minister, therefore, recommends that the merchantable timber on the Indian Reserve at Alert Bay described as part of Lot 1957 Rupert District, Province of British Columbia, be sold to William G. Lawson of Alert Bay, British Columbia, at a stumpage and royalty rate of Three Dollars and seventy-five cents ($3.75) per thousand feet board measure, without formal surrender and without public advertisement as required by the \"Regulations for the Disposal of Timber on Indian Reserves (British Columbia)\", all other provisions of the said Regulations remaining in full force and effect.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe/\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n\n[Signature]\n\nClerk of the Privy Council\n**RETURN OF LABOUR**\n\nfor **Improvements to Drainage** on **Industrial School Reserve**\n\nfor week ending November 4th and 11th, 1944.\n\n| NAMES       | Nature of Employment or Trade | Oct. | Nov. | TOTAL | PRICE PER hr. | AMOUNT OF WAGES | RECEIVED PAYMENT | WITNESS |\n|-------------|-------------------------------|------|------|-------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|---------|\n| George Brooks |                             | Mon  | Tues | Wed  | Thurs | Fri | Sat | hrs. |       |       |       |         |\n|             |                               | 30   | 31   | 1    | 2     | 3   | 4   | 48   | .62\u00bd | $42.32 | $42.32 | g B.

Todd)\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncs.\nAlert Bay, B. C.,\nJune 27th, 1945.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B. C., Department of Mines and Resources, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nYour letter of June 19th last, file #33-6-1069, has been received, and in reply I beg to give you the following information.\n\n(1) Originally Industrial School Reserve, Cormorant Island, Kwawkewlth Agency, consisted of 412 acres.\n\n(2) On June 18th, 1915, a portion of this Reserve was surveyed and subdivided and known as Lot Plan 227 B.C. Sub-Division of part of Indian Industrial School Reserve, Alert Bay, Cormorant Island, and contained 40 acres. This portion was surveyed into lots of approximately one acre, and since then quite a number of the lots have been taken up by various Indians of this Agency who have built homes thereon.\n\n(3) The balance of Indian Industrial School Reserve consists of 372 acres, part of which has been cleared and occupied by St. Michael's Indian Residential School, but this part has never been surveyed. The School has merely been clearing land on this portion of the Reserve year after year and putting it under cultivation. This area consists of a strip of land running straight through the Reserve from the foreshore in front of the School buildings to the foreshore at the rear of the Reserve, as per the attached rough sketch. The acreage cleared by the School is not known but I would say that it would be in the neighborhood of 40 acres. The balance of the Reserve south-west of the cleared land occupied by the School is virgin timber now being logged off.\n\n(4) As I have been working on a plan for some considerable time to have the Sub-Division and area now being logged off transferred to the Nimpkish Band to provide more space for them to build homes, it is considered a new survey should be made, setting aside the present portion of the Reserve now cleared and occupied by the School for school purposes.\n\n(5) The 40 acre Sub-Division should be transferred to the Nimpkish Band and re-named \"Nimpkish Reserve No. 8\".\n\n(6) That portion of Industrial School Reserve now being logged off and not occupied or used by St. Michael's Indian Residential School, be surveyed and transferred to the Nimpkish Band, naming it \"Nimpkish Reserve No. 9\".\n\nIn asking for these surveys and making these recommendations, it is being done for the following reasons:\n\nSt. Michael's Indian Residential School does not require any further property for the use of the School other than that which is now cleared and occupied.\ncould continue to give them permits to cut wood on the timbered area, if and when it was considered necessary.\n\nIn the early days the Nimpkish Band and the Department allowed members from other Bands to locate and occupy building sites on Alert Bay Reserve #1, owned by the Nimpkish Band. These people have been residents on this Reserve for a great many years and are trespassers. These members from other Bands are occupying property which is needed by members of the Nimpkish Band to build homes for their children, and has always been a source of trouble. Many Nimpkish Indians have been given lots on Industrial School Sub-Division because they could not find a location to build on their own Reserve.\n\nOf recent years this question has been slowing coming to a showdown, and more recently some members of the Nimpkish Band have suggested that members of other Bands residing on Alert Bay Reserve #1 should either transfer to the Nimpkish Band or return to their own Reserves, and in this suggestion I have concurred.\n\nAt the present time I have a few applications from outsiders who are now living on Alert Bay Reserve #1, to be accepted into the Nimpkish Band, and these will be placed before a meeting of the Nimpkish people as soon as it can be arranged. I do not think that it would be fair to the outsiders not to give them an opportunity to transfer to the Nimpkish Band after they have been permitted to live here all these years and, therefore, it is my intention to approach this subject in the following way.\n\nA meeting of the Nimpkish Band will be called to ascertain from them if they are willing to accept all outsiders now living on the Reserve into their Band, subject to their share of Band Funds being transferred with them, and the Department transferring the Sub-Division and timbered area of Industrial School Reserve to the Nimpkish Band, together with the proceeds of the sale of timber which is now being logged off.\n\nShould the present trespassers not wish to transfer to the Nimpkish Band after being given an opportunity to do so, they will be asked to return to their own Reserves.\n\nIf this plan could be worked out it will solve all our present problems insofar as providing necessary space for the building of new homes so badly needed at the present time. It will also compensate the Nimpkish people for their generosity shown all these years to these trespassers.\n\nAs it will not be possible to place this plan before the Department at an early date, it is recommended that the proceeds of the sale of the timber now being removed from Industrial School Reserve be set aside in a special account in Ottawa, so that it will be available for clearing land and opening up roads on these Reserve, in order that the Indians may settle thereon. This money should definitely be set aside for this purpose because it is going to cost considerable, and no Indian will take up property unless he has access to it by a proper road.\n\n(M. S.

Todd, Esq., Indian Agent, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of October 6th submitting the application of Simon Beans to take up residence on the Industrial School Reserve at Alert Bay.\n\nAs you are aware from previous correspondence we have had with you on the subject of this reserve there can be no question of locating any Indian to lands therein in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Act; but if Subdivision Lot No.82 is unoccupied Simon Beans may, with the approval of the Department, build a house thereon and with his family take up residence on the Reserve.\n\nIt should be pointed out to him beforehand, however, that the approval aforesaid gives him no interest whatsoever in the lot and that he is building on the reserve subject to whatever disposition we make of the land in future years, for as you are aware we have been considering for some time the unusual problems created by the fact that the reserve is held by the Crown in trust for all the Indians of the Province of British Columbia. In short, while we will give him permission to build on this reserve and live there with his family, such permission does not create in him any right to remain there for the rest of his life nor prevent his removal should we wish to have, for other purposes at a later date, use of the reserve. He is, of course, protected by law in that no Indian will be disposed of without compensation for improvements without reasonable compensation being paid. In the event of our requiring the land for other purposes we require the land owner to remove his improvements for his house.\n\nOn the other hand, if we have been reviewing...\nwith your office and in particular note our letter to you of May 26th, 1941 to which we do not appear to have received a reply. If you have any suggestions or observations to make concerning this Reserve we would be pleased to have them at your convenience.\n\nD.J. Allan,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves and Trusts.\nAlert Bay, B.

All on wrong file - Shown other correspondence.\nOttawa, April 1, 1946.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTHE DIRECTOR\n\nRe: Alert Bay School Land\n\nA parcel of approximately 412 acres on Cormorant Island is held by His Majesty in trust for \"all the Indians of British Columbia\" (authority executive minute No. 831 dated June 26, 1939). It is the writer's conception that this property is land held for school purposes and is not an Indian Reserve.\n\nIt appears from the correspondence that the bulk of this land is surplus to the needs of the school and parts of it have been used for many years as a place to locate pupils of the school who, for some reason or other, did not wish to return to their Band of origin. Now, under such circumstances, such Indians could obtain any legal right of possession eludes the writer. Not being an Indian Reserve, they could not hold under location ticket and even if it were desired that they should, there is no Band organization to allot the land to them as required by Section 21 of the Act. The fact, however, emerges that many Indians are actually there and the writer believes there are instances where Indians have sold their holdings on this land to others for a cash consideration. The whole legal situation is most obscure and unsatisfactory.\n\nIndian Agent Todd now comes forward with a proposal. He suggests that all of this land that is not actually required for school purposes be transferred to the Nimpkish Band who live adjacent to it and who have inadequate land (approximately 45 acres) on their present Reserve. He further suggests that those who presently live on the school land and who have been there for some years be offered membership in the Nimpkish Band subject to the usual condition of transfer of any funds to which they may be entitled by virtue\nof membership in their Bands of origin. He also suggests that if this were done a further subdivision of the Alert Bay school land could be made and Nimpkish Indians who require homes established thereon.\n\nThe proposal has, in the judgment of the writer, considerable merit but there are legal difficulties in the way concerning which I cannot clearly see the solution.\n\nIf in fact the Alert Bay land belongs to all the Indians of British Columbia, what authority has the Department to give it to the Nimpkish Band without consideration. In my judgment it would not be sufficient to declare the land surplus to the needs of the school and therefore unnecessary to retain it for its original purpose. It is suggested that either the Nimpkish Band or this Department on behalf of the Nimpkish Band would have to purchase it and place its value in money in the special account which we carry in the name of the Indians of British Columbia generally. It is apparent that Indian Agent Todd thinks it a simple matter to convey this land to the Nimpkish Band by executive order. It does not appear to the writer that it is so simple and I feel that if it is to be acquired for the purposes of the Nimpkish Band, it can only be by purchase either from the funds of the Nimpkish Band, which amount to only $1,950.00, or by purchase from appropriation for the Nimpkish Band at its actual appraised value. The latter would appear to be the only practical course of action and if it were done in this way, should be subject to the condition that all Indians presently resident on the Alert Bay land who are willing to be so absorbed should be transferred to the Nimpkish Band and those who object returned to their Bands of origin.\n\nD. J. Allen,\nSuperintendent,\nReserves & Trusts.\nCopy sent to\nM. S. Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nApril 1, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nYou will recall that the problem which had its origin in the settlement of Indians of various Bands on the Alert Bay school property is giving the Agent at Alert Bay some concern. I am enclosing a copy of a memorandum from the Superintendent of Reserves and Trusts setting out the legal difficulties of implementing Agent Todd's suggestions which, were it not for the said legal difficulties, constitute a practical solution which merits serious consideration.\n\nIt does not appear that we would require for school purposes a large acreage at Alert Bay and it does appear from Agent Todd's recommendations and suggestions that we do require additional land at that point for the accommodation of the Nimpkish Band. The land in question is, however, the property of all the Indians of British Columbia and if that large group is to be deprived of this land asset, it seems to me that they should receive value for it in the form of money.\n\nWe have little idea here what the value of the block required by the Nimpkish Band is. We assume it would be beyond the capacity of the Nimpkish Band to pay for it out of their Band funds. It might, therefore, be necessary to purchase it from appropriation and allot it to the Nimpkish Band. Agent Todd suggests that the Indians presently living on the land could be voted into the Nimpkish Band and their affairs administered in future as a part of that Band. This appears to be a happy solution.\n\nWill you, therefore, please give this matter consideration and if you think well of it you might make an appraisal of the value of the land to be transferred and recommend its purchase for the Nimpkish Band, bearing in\n\n......\nmind that if it is purchased out of appropriation such arrangement will be subject to the condition that the Nimpkish Band must vote into membership in their Band all of the Indians presently resident on Alert Bay lands who consent to such transfer. Whether or not we can get the appropriation through for that purpose is another matter but if, in your judgment, the situation can be cleared up in the manner suggested we are prepared to ask Parliament to vote the necessary moneys.\n\nDirector.\n## RETURN OF LABOUR on the burning debris on newly constructed roads\n\n**Jonathan Whamock**\n\n| Name of Employment | Min. | Tues. | Wed. | Thurs. | Fri. | Sat. | Sun. | Total |\n|--------------------|-----|------|------|--------|-----|-----|------|-------|\n| Labour - burning debris on roads | May 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | 31 | 1 | 22 | .62\u00bd |\n| June 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 22 | .62\u00bd |\n\n**Received payment**\n\n- **Jonathan Whamock**: $27.50\n\n---\n\n**Cheque No.:**  \n**Vote:**  \n**Agency:**  \n**Balance:**  \n**Allotment:**  \n**E.R.:**  \n**Payment Approved:**  \n\nI hereby certify that the services have been performed, materials supplied, and prices are fair and just.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

This conference was not, by any means, an agreement between them as to what should be done, as stated in the Agent's letter of June 12th enclosed herewith, but a statement of the latter's views.\n\nThe rough tracing enclosed of the subdivision of the Lot east of the Residential School will show the work already carried out from the information supplied by Agent Todd at the conference referred to, and this will be observed to consist of approximately:\n\n1,000 ft. of beach on Broughton strait graded for a road, no clearing required.\n4,000 ft. of roads cleared with a bull-dozer, stumps being pushed to sides of roads and yet to be disposed of. Require grading and graveling. This work exposed springs on Hill Street between Sub-Lots 34 and 35 making it unusable and requiring drainage as well as grading and graveling.\n500 ft. of Park Street cleared, graded and gravelled, the only work completed, evidently with the intention to open up Sub-Lot 24 for a school and Sub-Lots 35 and 37 for a recreation ground for Alert Bay Indians.\nSub-Lots 35 and 37 partially cleared for recreation ground.\nfor Alert Bay Indians.\n\nThese cleared areas will all revert to bush as time goes on unless used or travelled over.\n\nThe work yet to be done and for which the $1,000 is applied for by the Agent is set out in paragraph (1) of his enclosed letter and would apparently consist of:\n\n(1) Burning stumps on and grading and travelling road \"leading to the school\", which according to the plan would be about 250 ft. between Sub-Lots 22 and 24 on Park Street.\n(2) Clear Lot 24 for construction of new Indian Day School.\n\nHis letter of application for the funds dated March 2nd last, forwarded to the Department, advised that the amount was required to carry out the following:\n\n(1) Gravel the roads now cleared with the bull-dozer.\n(2) Bridge over springs opened up on Hill Street and establishing drainage as this flow will erode the street, if not controlled.\n(3) Clear school and playground site.\n(4) Burn all slash and debris, apparently including the bull-dozed stumps alongside the roads opened up.\n\nIt will be noted that this is quite a different programme to that originally proposed for the amount asked for. While the Dominion Water and Power Branch will not be able to send a man up to Alert Bay for several months, according to Colonel Whyte of that Branch, the need for such an examination still exists in the light of the foregoing.\n\nAgent Todd advised that the Nimpkish Band are now quite lukewarm about taking over Lot 1957 as an addition to their holdings and having the trespass situation cleared. From Agent Todd's letters, it would appear that they expect to secure the use of the land, ready for occupation, to take care of their overflow without any corresponding obligations. In discussing the Department's problem, as set out in their letter of April lst in which they stated that the interest of\nAll the Indians of the Province in the Lot would have to be liquidated before it could be transferred to the Nimpkish Band, the Inspector advised that a valuation would have to be made for this purpose and that it would probably be found to be not less than $15,000 for the whole, or about $27.50 per acre. To this he made immediate objection as being far too high which was quite interesting in view of his very much inflated values that we have had to contend with when the public and others endeavour to secure use of Reserve lands in very remote spots, asking an annual rental of $100.00 per acre for the road right-of-way on Thomas Point Reserve. An alternative solution would be to require of Indian occupants of the property, including the use of the recreation ground, an annual rental on a lease basis if the interest of the Indians of the Province as a whole is to be protected.\n\nThe greater part of the Agent's letter enclosed is taken up with the purchase of Air Force buildings at Hardy Bay and re-erecting them on Sub-Lot 24 as a five-room school with quarters for four teachers, no suggestion being made as to what use is to be made of the existing and somewhat substantial school on the Reserve. The use of the huts in this manner is expected to cost us $8,000. I can not recommend the expenditure of such a large amount on temporary structures nor do I see the necessity for such an extensive plan as that suggested. I consider that the existing Day School building should be continued as the primary room as the proposed location on Lot 24 on top of the hill is too far for the little legs of the village, being about a mile distant from the main Village and quite a climb.\n\nI forwarded on June 18th a separate letter regarding the purchase of the R.C.A.F. buildings for school use all over the Agency, to the Department but if it is going to cost as much as we estimated in this case to make these buildings over into temporary school buildings, then we should consider proper construction for our money.\n\nIn conclusion, I would recommend that nothing further be done in the matter until the interest of B.C. Indians as a whole in the property is extinguished (See Mr. Allan's Memorandum of April 1st, 1946), an examination of the Lot be made by an Engineer of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau in\nrespect to the Agent's proposals, and a valuation of the property be made by an official of this Office.\n\nFor D.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of Mr. Inspector Coleman's letter of June 25, File 6-13-2, in which he reports that Mr. Agent Reid requests authority to expend $35.00 for the purchase of building material for Simon Ross who is building a new house on the Industrial School Reserve.\n\nI have discussed the question of permitting Indians to establish permanent residence on the Industrial School Reserve with the Reserve Branch, and they called my attention to a letter of October 12, 1945, same file, in which the Superintendent of Reserves and Trunks stated that Ross could establish himself on the Industrial School Reserve if he so desired. It was to be understood, however, that this permission did not create in him any right to remain there for the rest of his life nor prevent his removal should we wish the land for other purposes at a later date. The letter goes on to state that Ross, if he was removed from the land, would be eligible for compensation for any improvements that he might have placed therein and, therefore, he would be entitled to compensation for his house if he erected one.\n\nIn view of the above the Branch feels that we should place no obstacle in the way of Ross residing on the Industrial Reserve, but at the present time we are not concerned in using funds provided to assist Indians to erect houses, to establish him there.\n\nPlease advise Mr. Reid accordingly.\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.

C.,\nJune 12th, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Dinmore:\n\nThis is to acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 1st last, file #L.B. 13718, together with copy of Mr. R. A. Hoey's letter dated May 21st, 1946, file #565586, and your letter of June 1st last, file #L.B. 13718, addressed to Mr. R. A. Hoey, Director, Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nI have carefully perused the latter in which you set out the particulars in respect to the buildings Port Hardy Military Camp, and it is very difficult indeed to understand why the Government itself is not given more consideration by the War Assets Corporation in respect to their own property. These buildings which we are trying to obtain are for Government use, and unless we can obtain them we will be obliged to buy new material which is going to cost the taxpayers a great deal of money. It seems only reasonable that when the Government owns the buildings themselves they should have first priority.\n\nIt is my understanding that when any Government buildings are declared surplus to requirements they are turned over to the War Allocation Committee, and they in turn are obliged by regulation to notify all Federal Government Departments that these buildings are available and give them an opportunity to take them over before turning them over to the War Assets Corporation for disposal. Would you please advise me if our Department was advised in accordance with regulations. I am also informed that if Federal Government Departments find they need any surplus equipment/after it has been turned over to War Assets Corporation, that it can be returned to the War Allocation Committee for disposal to Federal Government Departments. I would appreciate if you would advise me if this still can be done.\n\np.t.o.\nI have carefully examined the prices which you have placed on these buildings originally built for the Port Hardy Military Camp, and find the valuation placed on them is all out of proportion when you take into consideration these buildings are located in a swamp in the woods about a mile from shore, where they will first have to be dismantled and then transported over a plank road. If these buildings were located in or near the city of Vancouver where transportation was not a factor, you would be able to get much more for them than you will in their present location; but I am satisfied whoever put the valuation on these buildings has no conception of what it will cost to dismantle these buildings and transport them to a new location for re-building. I am sure when any prospective purchaser goes into the cost of dismantling, transportation, and waste, any offer you may get will only be a fraction of the price you have submitted to our Department.\n\nI am informed that W/C Little, when he was O/C of the Port Hardy-Coal Harbour Airports, purchased similar pre-fabricated buildings for $100 a piece and moved them to Vancouver for re-building. These buildings were practically on the beach at the Airport and could be moved at very little cost and yet, I am informed, he had difficulty in breaking even. Our Department had previously been given priority on these buildings which W/C Little later purchased. Mr. Berry, then Chairman, gave the Department of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, this undertaking on July 22nd, 1944, file #223-36R-600, serial #38, and category #600. We heard nothing further but later learned, to our astonishment, the buildings were sold to W/C Little and other private individuals for a very nominal sum.\n\nIn your letter to Mr. Hoey you state there are twenty-nine Loxtave huts, and the price set at 40\u00a2 per square foot amounts to $21,427.20. This works out at an average of $738.87 per building. Recently I have inspected and examined every building in the Military Camp referred to. I know how they are constructed, and in dismantling them there is going to be a considerable waste. The lumber will merely be used for the construction of an ordinary building and not a pre-fabricated building. If these buildings could be sold and used in the same location without dismantling, then the price asked would be more or less in line with their value; but as there is no use for them in their present location and must be dismantled and transported to new locations and rebuilt, I feel anything you can get for them will be like found money.\n\np.t.o.\nOur Department would not be interested in the ten wooden frame construction buildings you refer to at the price asked, as the waste would be so great in tearing down, plus the cost of labour and transportation, that they would cost more than new buildings. We could only take them over as a gift. We are, however, vitally interested in the Lextave huts, as these buildings could be dismantled and the material transported a short distance and used for the construction of an ordinary building. It is our intention, if arrangements can be made, to use this material for Indian homes and schools to educate their children.\n\nFor your information, I am again taking this matter up with the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, who, no doubt, will make you an offer in line with the value we place on them for our use.\n\nIf we could obtain even twelve or fifteen of these pre-fabricated buildings (or the whole camp at a nominal figure) it will be of great assistance to our Department; and any consideration you can show us will be very much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Ms. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. G. H. S. Dinsmore, Director,\nLands and Buildings Department,\nWar Assets Corporation,\nP. O. Box 6099,\nMontreal, Canada.\nAlert Bay, B. C.,\nJune 12th, 1946.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B. C., Department of Mines and Resources, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nJust previous to you leaving for Ottawa I discussed with you the serious school situation and other matters in the Kwawkewlth Agency, and requested that you take them up while in the East. As you did not have sufficient time to go into all the detail with me, you requested me to carry on my conversations and go into the details more fully with Inspector Coleman.\n\nFollowing your departure Mr. Coleman and myself went into these matters fully, and the program we have in mind entails three undertakings which must be worked out together; namely:\n\n(1) Set aside new Indian Day School site in Industrial School Reserve, Alert Bay, B. C. Clearing of the site, graveling and burning refuse on the roads leading to the school, which requires immediate action and reply in order to take advantage of the bulldozer still on the island.\n\n(2) Arrange to take over, purchase if necessary at a nominal figure, pre-fabricated buildings suitable for classrooms from the War Assets Corporation.\n\n(3) Provide sufficient funds for the dismantling, transporting, and re-assembling, with additional material, of some of these buildings on the school site referred to above.\n\nIn respect to No. 1, after talking the matter over very carefully with Inspector Coleman, it was decided that the whole of Lot 24, Industrial School Reserve, Alert Bay, should be set aside for school purposes and play ground. This is an excellent level site which has been logged off leaving stumps, small second growth timber and refuse, and I estimate it will cost approximately $500.00 to clear this acre of land. The road which we have been building through the Industrial School Reserve leading to the school site requires to be gravelled, and the refuse on the roads adjacent thereto burned to remove any fire hazard, and I estimate this will cost approximately $500.00. I would guarantee to have this work done for the above figure. As this money is going to be used for school purposes it would naturally have to come from the school vote, and if funds are not available, I would recommend that as the House is still in session, it be requested as a supplementary vote.\n\nIn regard to No. 2 I enclose you, herewith, copy of a letter which I have written to Mr. Dinsmore, Director of Lands and Buildings Department, War Assets Corporation, which will be self-explanatory. For the Department's information, I have carefully perused the letter dated June 1st last written by Mr. Fraser of the War Assets Corporation to Mr. R. A. Hoey, Director, in respect to Port Hardy Military Camp, B. C., and\n\np.t.o.\nnoted the remarks contained in paragraph two, and also the valuation set on the pre-fabricated buildings. In my opinion, the price asked for these buildings is all out of proportion due to the fact that they are in an isolated place, and the heavy cost that will be involved to remove them elsewhere. It is noted they are asking 40\u00a2 per square foot, which is roughly 35% of the original cost. If we are unable to get these buildings transferred to us without cost, I feel we could well afford to pay 10\u00a2 a square foot or even 15\u00a2 if necessary, and still obtain classrooms at a minimum cost.\n\nI have gone to considerable trouble in working out what it would cost for dismantling, transportation, and re-assembling the buildings required for the Alert Bay Indian Day School, and estimate the cost would be $8,000.00. This would include any additional material we would have to purchase to complete the work. I am enclosing a rough sketch showing how the buildings would be assembled and the plan of the entire school. You will please note provision is also being made for two teacherages in connection with the building. This will give us three classrooms and two play rooms, one of which could be used for a fourth classroom if necessary. We would also have cloak and wash rooms.\n\nI have made a survey of the permanent Indian families now resident in Alert Bay and find there are 136 children of school age and 83 of pre-school age. In addition to this there are 16 children of school age whose families are not permanent residents but live here roughly six months of the year, and their children attend school. These families have 9 children of pre-school age. In regard to the permanent residents of school age, a few of these children are now in the Residential School, but would be discharged and sent to the Day School if accommodation was provided. This would make it possible to take other children into the Residential School from outside villages where no school facilities are provided and where there are not sufficient to establish a permanent school.\n\nAs we have been informed that considerable sums of money have been provided for schools in the rehabilitation plan, and as the school situation is such a serious matter, it would seem only right and proper that these funds should be made available at once in order that we can take advantage of this splendid opportunity to provide the needed buildings to properly educate our Indian children.\n\nIf we could obtain the buildings referred to at a nominal cost and this plan worked out, we will have the needed schools and teacherage at half the present day cost, and I hope the Department will use every effort to bring this about.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncs.\nSept. 4, 1946.\n\nM. S. Todd, Esq., Indian Agent, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 31st ultimo with reference to your application for assistance to Simon Beans in the construction of a new home on the Industrial Reserve at Alert Bay, I would advise that while your letter has been forwarded to the Department it is not expected that any action will be taken as they clearly stated in their letter of July 3rd, 1946, a copy of which you were provided with, that public funds could not be spent on this Reserve until the matter of its disposition had been settled.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAlert Bay, B. C.,\nAug. 31st, 1946.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B. C., Department of Mines and Resources, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nThis is to acknowledge receipt of your letter of July 6th last, file #6-13-2, enclosing copy of a letter received from Ottawa, file #156-0-8, dated July 3rd, in respect to my recommendation for the Department to assist Simon Beans in the purchasing of some building materials for the erection of a new home being built on the Industrial School Reserve, Alert Bay, B. C.\n\nFirst let me say I appreciate the Department's ruling and understand the situation entirely, but I do not believe I have made myself as clear as I should have when recommending this assistance to Beans. When the Department gave Mr. Beans Lot No. 22 on Industrial School Reserve for the purpose of building a home thereon for his family, so that he could educate his children by sending them to the Alert Bay Indian Day School, and for other reasons, they distinctly stated this permission was granted subject to certain conditions. These conditions were explained to Mr. Beans before he was allowed to occupy the lot. He understood them thoroughly and agreed to comply with any requirement of the Department.\n\nHe has an application filed in this office to transfer to the Nimpkish Band of Indians if and when it is permissible, and the Nimpkish Band have agreed to accept him in. There is nothing further he can do.\n\nMr. Beans has told me he is prepared to comply with any requirement of the Department, whether it is transferring to the Nimpkish Band or vacating the property. In the case of the latter it would be at his own responsibility. The Department are not assuming any responsibility whatever in respect to his home, as he was allowed to locate thereon under certain conditions which he must comply with.\n\np.t.o.\nBeans has his house partially completed. This house, when built, will be a credit to himself and the Department. It will cost in the neighbourhood of $4,000.00. I do not feel we are being fair with him by refusing this assistance when we have been helping others under similar conditions on the same Reserve. Our whole thought is to try and encourage Indians to complete good homes, and I do not consider we would be wise in not assisting this progressive Indian when he is willing to comply with every regulation made by the Department.\n\nSupposing something did turn up which I do not think is possible, and he was asked to leave the Reserve - he would merely dispose of his home to another Indian, so in the long run we would be helping some Indian have a good home to live in.\n\nIn order to assist this Indian in completing his home so that he will have a place for his family to live in this winter, I am prepared to see that the Department will not have to compensate him in any way for any improvements Beans makes on his Lot should the Department find it necessary to ask him to vacate. Let us help this deserving Indian and let it not be said that we refused to assist someone deserving of help. If there was any question in my mind about the final outcome of Beans' right to locate here I would not, under any consideration, make this request to the Department.\n\nI would, therefore, appreciate if the Department would reconsider and allow me to assist him to the amount requested.\n\nAn early reply will be appreciated as the winter is drawing near.\n\n(M.

The expenditures will be charged to Appropriation which course is considered advisable and justified in that they should certainly be paid and because eventually the lands will be used for the benefit of Indians. However, definite instructions should be issued to Mr. Todd to incur no further costs in this connection until the entire question has been settled.\n\nIt is noted that the Nimpkish Band hope to acquire the use of this Reserve without assuming any responsibilities or corresponding obligations. Also, although Agent Todd recommends the purchase of certain buildings for use as a five-room school, this should be put in abeyance until the interest of the British Columbia Indians as a whole, in the property, is extinguished. Please let us have a statement as to the Indians by families who now occupy the land in question. The statement should also give complete information as to the Band of origin of each family. How much of Lot 1937 is occupied and what is the estimated population which would properly be accommodated on this land? When information along the above line has been submitted, we will be in a position to pursue the matter further.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector\n\nIndian Affairs.

Walton,\n\nUnder date of December 8th, 1945, Indian Agent Todd of Alert Bay advised that steps should be taken to open up the Industrial School Reserve on Cormorant Island, Alert Bay, British Columbia. This was also recommended by Commissioner MacKay. The only funds available for the purpose were those to the credit of the \"Indians of British Columbia Account\" where proceeds of timber, sold on the parcel in question, had been placed and release could only be effected by Order in Council. We arranged with you, since the funds were needed immediately, to advance $1500.00 from your Appropriation for this purpose, to be repaid when the Order in Council had been passed. Various factors contributed to a delay which carried us past the end of the fiscal year.\n\nNow it develops that it would be unwise to expend Trust Funds in the development of this parcel until the Band membership of the Indians living there has been determined and the ownership of the Reserve has been settled. We are, however, faced with the necessity of paying some $1500.00 in accounts incurred in road work and clearing the land. Since it is felt the Reserve will certainly be allotted to Indians, the expenditure could, we feel, safely be made from your Appropriation. It would be appreciated, therefore, if you would make the necessary arrangements for the payment of these accounts. If you will return the file to the Trusts Division, Commissioner MacKay will be further advised as to what is now required as preliminaries to settling the entire matter.\n\nFor D.J.

This conference was not, by any means, an agreement between them as to what should be done, as stated in the Agent's letter of June 12th enclosed here-with, but a statement of the latter's views.\n\nThe rough tracing enclosed of the subdivision of the Lot east of the Residential School will show the work already carried out from the information supplied by Agent Todd at the conference referred to, and this will be observed to consist of approximately:\n\n1,000 ft. of beach on Broughton strait graded for a road, no clearing required.\n4,000 ft. of roads cleared with a bull-dozer, stumps being pushed to sides of roads and yet to be disposed of.

This work exposed springs on Hill Street between Sub-Lots 34 and 38 making it unusable and requiring drainage as well as grading and graveling.\n500 ft. of Park Street cleared, graded and gravelled, the only work completed, evidently with the intention to open up Sub-Lot 24 for a school and Sub-Lots 35 and 37 for a recreation ground for Alert Bay Indians.\nSub-Lots 35 and 37 partially cleared for recreation ground\nfor Alert Bay Indians.\n\nThese cleared areas will all revert to bush as time goes on unless used or travelled over.\n\nThe work yet to be done and for which the $1,000 is applied for by the Agent is set out in paragraph (1) of his enclosed letter and would apparently consist of:\n\n(1) Burning stumps on and grading and graveling road \"leading to the school\", which according to the plan would be about 250 ft. between Sub-Lots 22 and 24 on Park Street.\n\n(2) Clear Lot 24 for construction of new Indian Day School.\n\nHis letter of application for the funds dated March 2nd last, forwarded to the Department, advised that the amount was required to carry out the following:\n\n(1) Gravel the roads now cleared with the bull-dozer.\n(2) Bridge over springs opened up on Hill Street and establishing drainage as this flow will erode the street, if not controlled.\n(3) Clear school and playground site.\n(4) Burn all slash and debris, apparently including the bull-dozed stumps alongside the roads opened up.\n\nIt will be noted that this is quite a different programme to that originally proposed for the amount asked for. While the Dominion Water and Power Branch will not be able to send a man up to Alert Bay for several months, according to Colonel Whyte of that Branch, the need for such an examination still exists in the light of the foregoing.\n\nAgent Todd advised that the Nimpkish Band are now quite lukewarm about taking over Lot 1957 as an addition to their holdings and having the trespass situation cleared. From Agent Todd's letters, it would appear that they expect to secure the use of the land, ready for occupation, to take care of their overflow without any corresponding obligations. In discussing the Department's problem, as set out in their letter of App.1st in which they stated that the interest of\nall the Indians of the Province in the Lot would have to be liquidated before it could be transferred to the Nimpkish Band, the Inspector advised that a valuation would have to be made for this purpose and that it would probably be found to be not less than $15,000 for the whole, or about $27.50 per acre. To this he made immediate objection as being far too high which was quite interesting in view of his very much inflated values that we have had to contend with when the public and others endeavour to secure use of Reserve lands in very remote spots, asking an annual rental of $100.00 per acre for the road right-of-way on Thomas Point Reserve. An alternative solution would be to require of Indian occupants of the property, including the use of the recreation ground, an annual rental on a lease basis if the interest of the Indians of the Province as a whole is to be protected.\n\nThe greater part of the Agent's letter enclosed is taken up with the purchase of Air Force buildings at Hardy Bay and re-erecting them on Sub-Lot 24 as a five-room school with quarters for four teachers, no suggestion being made as to what use is to be made of the existing and somewhat substantial school on the Reserve. The use of the huts in this manner is expected to cost us $8,000. I can not recommend the expenditure of such a large amount on temporary structures nor do I see the necessity for such an extensive plan as that suggested. I consider that the existing Day School building should be continued as the primary room as the proposed location on Lot 24 on top of the hill is too far for the little legs of the village, being about a mile distant from the main Village and quite a climb.\n\nI forwarded on June 18th a separate letter, regarding the purchase of the R.C.A.F. buildings for school use all over the Agency, to the Department but if it is going to cost as much as we estimated in this case to make these buildings over into temporary school buildings, then we should consider proper construction for our money.\n\nIn conclusion, I would recommend that nothing further be done in the matter until the interest of B.C. Indians as a whole in the property is extinguished (See Mr. Allan's Memorandum of April 1st, 1946), an examination of the Lot be made by an Engineer of the Dominion Water and Power Bureau in\nrespect to the Agent's proposals, and a valuation of the property be made by an official of this Office.\n\nFor D.

Cory, Esq.,\nDepartmental Solicitor\n\nI am enclosing herewith Branch file 27156-29 and would be pleased to have you examine the tubbed letters and documents with reference to the Alert Bay Industrial School Reserve on Cormorant Island.\n\nChief Surveyor Robertson's memorandum of April 4th, 1935 attached to a memorandum dated March 8th, 1929 contains an accurate report of the original minutes of decision with reference to the creation of the reserve and the history thereof is further outlined in a memorandum by George Patrick dated April 4th, 1935 and a letter from C.H. Taggart, May 10th, 1939.\n\nOur present problem is that the Nimpkish Band, whose Reserve Alert Bay No.1 is presently overcrowded, have expressed a desire to secure part of the Industrial School Reserve for purposes of expansion. The problem is further complicated by the fact that during the years of operation of the Industrial School graduating students, who have been members of various British Columbia Bands, have been permitted to build homes on a subdivided portion of the Industrial School Reserve. As I said previously, this practice has been going on for a good many years now and so far as we can tell there are at least 30 families of various Bands residing on a subdivision on the Industrial School Reserve.\n\nThe Industrial School does not actually use or require more than a small portion of the Reserve's 412 acres and it has been suggested that the outcome to the present problem would be to create a new Band made up of the various other Band members who are residing on the Island together with any Nimpkish Band members who might wish to transfer to the new Band and set aside\nfor the new Band the subdivided portion and sufficient additional land to provide for reasonable expansion in the future. In short, we would like to create a new Reserve with part of the Industrial School Reserve and set it aside for the use of a new Band.\n\nOur problem is whether this is possible. As you will note the original minute of decision, setting apart the Industrial School Reserve, stated that the land was to be for the Nimpkish Band but the original minute was amended setting apart the property as \"Alert Bay Industrial School Reserve\". While the minute of decision above mentioned was dated March 10th, 1891 it was not until June 21st, 1939 that title to the property was actually transferred from the Province of British Columbia to the Dominion, a copy of the Order in Council being hereunder tabbed \"A\". The said Order in Council conveys the property to the Dominion in trust for the use and benefit of the Indians of British Columbia, subject, however, etc., and it is the part following the words \"subject, however,\" that we are interested in at the moment.\n\nI would be glad if you would examine the correspondence and the Order in Council and advise us on the following points:\n\n1. Under the conditions contained in the Order in Council from the Province have we the right to set aside a portion of the Industrial School Reserve for the use of any Band?\n\n2. If not, have we the right to purchase a portion of the Industrial School Reserve as a reserve for a particular Band and deposit the purchase price in an account to the credit of the Indians of British Columbia?\n\nBriefly, we can see no way out of our present difficulty unless we can create a reserve for a particular Band and while we feel that we probably have such right, there seems some question as to whether we can do so without reimbursing the Indians of British Columbia in general. I would be glad to have you consider the entire matter and let us have the benefit of your advice.\n\nfor L.J.

It must be definitely understood, however, that no further costs may be incurred in this connection until the entire question has been settled.\n\nThe Nimpkish Band apparently hope to acquire the use of this Reserve without assuming any responsibilities or corresponding obligations and although your recommendation with respect to the purchase of certain buildings for use as a 5-room school has been noted the proposal is in abeyance until the interest of the British Columbia Indians as a whole in the property is extinguished. In order that the matter may be proceeded with please let me have a statement as to the Indian families who now occupy the land in question, in addition giving complete information as to the Band of origin of each family. You should also advise how much of Lot 1957 is occupied and the estimated population which would properly be accommodated on this land.\n\nFor D. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, February 2nd, 1948.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO:\n\n- Mr. Allan -\n\nRe: Alert Bay Industrial School Reserve B.C.\n\nYou will recall that the problem regarding settlement of Indians on the above mentioned land, is of long standing and that, despite a large amount of correspondence and investigation, in so far as the Department was concerned, it was never decided (a) that settlement of Indians on this land was desirable or (b) how such settlement could be accomplished, even if desirable, in view of the peculiar status of the land.\n\nI have now had an opportunity to discuss the entire problem, at length, with Agent Todd and with a much more complete picture of the situation at the Island (Cowichan Island), I am of the opinion that the proposal to allot the unused portion of the reserve as a new reserve for the Nimpkish Band is most desirable and almost a necessity due to developments that have taken place in recent years. It is, therefore, proposed to briefly outline herein the status of the Reserve, the situation presently existing thereon and to offer suggestions as to how it may be remedied.\n\nSTATUS - The original Minute of Decision setting this reserve apart stated that the land was set apart as Reserve No. 6 of the Nimpkish Band and that it was approved by the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works. At the suggestion of the Department (and I have not been able to discover why) the said Minute was amended by Commissioner O'Heilly and again approved by the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works as follows:\n\n\"Minute of Decision, 5th March, 1891, approved by Chief Commissioner of Lands 10th March, 1891, setting apart as reserve 410 acres.\"\n\n\"Minute of Decision\nAlert Bay Indian Industrial School reserve.\nA reserve of 410 acres situated etc. (description)\"\n\nThe Royal Commission (1912-14), on being requested to declare a portion of the land to be an Indian reserve, replied that \"Inasmuch as the tract of land comprised in the Industrial School Reserve at Alert Bay was alienated by the Province of British Columbia and subsequently acquired by the Government of the Dominion of Canada for a school reserve, the Commission has no authority to constitute or confirm the whole or any portion thereof as an Indian Reserve.\"\nunder the terms of the Agreement, the Dominion being the unquestionable owner of the property and unhampered by the terms of the agreement in dealing therewith in such manner as may appear to the Dominion Government to best meet the purposes of the purchase of the said land, but that from what the Commissioner learned at meetings with the Indians at Port Bay, it seems to the Dominion that it would be right and proper to secure in occupation the Indians who have, with the consent or acquiescence of the Department of Indian Affairs, made homes upon the said tract of land.\"\n\nIt is not understood why the Royal Commission referred to the property as having been purchased and to the Dominion Government as being the \"unquestionable owner\" for neither our records nor those of the Province substantiate such statements. It is difficult to understand how the Commission were misinformed on this matter, but it now appears that they were, and in view of the concluding remarks in the Commissioner's statement, above quoted, it seems safe to assume, that if the true status of the land had been known they probably would have constituted a portion of the land a reserve for the Indians living therein, that is the Nicknack Road.\n\nIt was not until 1939 that steps were taken to clarify the status of the land. At that date C. H. Taggart, acting for the Dominion on a \"Commission Investigating Ordinance and Admiralty Lands in British Columbia\", brought to the attention of both the Dominion and Provincial Governments that the reserve in question had not been included in the schedule of reserves conveyed to the Crown Dominion by C.C. 28th July, 1938.\n\nInvestigation by the Provincial authorities confirmed this and, as they were at a loss to know why the title had not been transferred previously, they were prepared to rectify the omission and by Order in Council No. 621 of June 1st, 1939 - Lot 1937 in Rupert District, containing 415 acres more or less, was conveyed to His Majesty the King in the right of the Dominion of Canada \"in trust for the use and benefit of the Indians of the Province of British Columbia, subject however to the right of the Dominion Government to deal with the said land in such manner as they may deem best suited for the purpose of the Indians, including a right to sell the said land and fund or use the proceeds for the benefit of the Indians........\"\n\nIt is the opinion of the Departmental Solicitor, in which the writer concurs, that the Provincial conveyance aforementioned does not create this land a reserve, within the meaning of the Indian Act, as the land was not set apart for the use and benefit of any particular Band of Indians. In consequence the land would fall within the category of \"Public Lands of the Dominion\" Chap. 114 R.S. 1937 and subject to the consent of the Governor General in Council, the Dominion could, therefore, to quote the terms of the Provincial conveyance \"deal with the said land in such manner as they may deem best suited for the purpose of the Indians\" without the necessity of securing the consent of the Indians given by way of a surrender of their interest. You will recall that Lots 145, 146 and 154, Group 1, New Westminster District, were not long ago sold to the City of New Westminster after ascertainment that they were not Indian reserve lands within the meaning of the Indian Act.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6429, file 875-9, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n\nPOOR-COPY\nLocal Situation:\n\nAs evidenced by the original Minute of Decision aforementioned, there were Indians of the Nipiski Band on Cormorant Island before any thought was given to officially setting the land in question aside as a reserve and, in fact, according to Agent Todd, the existence of the residential school is due to the fact that the first missionary to these Indians took up a pre-emption adjacent to the then Indian holdings and later surrendered his rights to the pre-emption on the understanding that a school would be opened there. In short, the Indians were generally located in this part of the island before the school was built and it is not clear why it was thought necessary to set aside the entire 412 acres for school purposes, thus overlooking the interests of the Indians who had been residing in the area for some time.\n\nIn 1904 the Indian Agent requested that a portion of the 412 acre parcel be subdivided and allotted to certain ex-pupils of the school who had been permitted by the former agent to settle on the land and following approval by the Department a small surveyed subdivision was laid out. The question of issuing Location Tickets for this subdivision was considered at that date and ruled out for the reason that the land was not a reserve within the meaning of the Act. Following the statement of the Royal Commission of 1913-14, concerning the status of this land, the Department instructed the Indian Agent to \"give recognition of title in writing to each individual occupant of land on this property\". It was understood that the regulated form of Location Ticket was not to be issued.\n\nIn 1915 a portion of the Reserve extending across the island and extending to the eastern boundary was subdivided into lots of approximately one acre each, the new lots including, in so far as possible, the improvements and holdings laid out in the former subdivision. The new subdivision, comprising 40 lots and streets, covered the same 60.75 acres and is as shown on Plan B.C. 377.\n\nYou will recall that when the problem in question was considered some years ago, we did not view with favour the idea of creating, to all intents and purposes, a new Band made up of ex-pupils of the school and Indians of many bands. The objection was also raised that we would be establishing Indians on small lots where they had no apparent means of earning a living whereas, if they return to their own reserves, they might find ample land.\n\nInformation secured since then has clarified the picture considerably and we are now advised that the subdivision is neither entirely populated by pupils nor are they residents from a large number of other places. A fairly recent list, submitted by Agent Todd, shows that out of the 38 heads of families residing on the subdivision, the Band or Agency origins is as follows: Nipiski - 10; Hemililikulla - 5; Kenoskowith - 5; Etekakumunk - 11; Battingi - 1; Tannatamuk - 1, and New Westminster - 1. In short, close to one-half the residents are residents of the Nipiski Band who own land in the vicinity.\n\nWhile it is true that certain ex-pupils have settled in the subdivision, as stated previously, all residents are not ex-pupils and while Agent Todd can at length give reasons why ex-pupils and...\nothers wish to settle there, the case of Simon Beams, who is not an ex-pupil, is probably illustrative of the general picture. Beams is apparently an industrious Indian who, through his fishing activities, earned a considerable income yearly while resident with other members of the Musalilikulla Band on their Reserve. However, due to the potlatch custom, as practised by the Band, his industry and substantial earnings gained him next to nothing each year. Realizing this, he publicly declared to his Band that he was giving up the custom and thereafter he and his family were persecuted to such an extent that he concluded he would either have to become enfranchised or seek shelter on other reserves. I gather that he made application to reside on the subdivision on Cormorant Island and was granted permission to do so and since then, through his fishing activities, he has within a few years been able to build a $6,000.00 home and purchase a seine boat for himself.\n\nAccording to Agent Todd there are many other Indians in his Agency who desire to get away from the potlatch custom but find themselves unable to do so while remaining on their reserve and would be only too willing to move to the Island if they were given a lot. The subdivision is further desirable to the Indians generally in that the fish canneries at Alert Bay on the Southern part of the Island provide a ready market for fish or an opportunity for employment and I understand that all Indians on the Island earn their livelihood in the fishing industry. They are not, nor are likely to be, farmers and require only sufficient land for a house and a garden.\n\nThe Nisqually Indians, of whom there are ten presently living on the subdivision, have a reserve almost adjacent to the 412 acre reserve and have several other reserves on the mainland but the mainland reserves are of little or no value to them and the majority live on the Island for they are engaged in the fishing industry or employed in the canneries. Their Cormorant Island Reserve - Nisqually Reserve No. 1 - comprises only about 40 acres and is actually too small and they naturally look to the subdivided area as an escape from the over-crowded conditions on their Reserve.\n\nIn short, the Department, by subdividing the area in the first instance and permitting Indians of various Bands to take up residence thereon, has itself created the problem now before us and due to the nature of the improvements made by the Indians on the subdivision, it would be almost impossible at this date to demand that they leave. However, within the past year or so, the Department has built a new day school on the subdivision to take care of the pupils thereon. Apart from the difficulty of stopping settlement and reverting the land to its former use, there would appear to be no real reason to refuse to allow the community to grow, as it has in the past, by settlement of either ex-pupils or other responsible Indians who make application to reside there. Surely our aim is to encourage Indians to make the best possible use of their ability and education and if an Indian can make a better living on Cormorant Island than on his former reserve, why should he be refused the opportunity particularly if he is opposed to the potlatch custom and wishes to get away from it. It is considered that starting with a surveyed subdivision and populating it with a group of Indians who are probably of average intelligence and who are earning more than average wages, there is a fine opportunity to build up a model community.\nSolution 7:\n\nIt has been proposed that to solve the difficulty presently existing, all that portion of the \"Reserve\" not required for the use of the Industrial School be set aside as a Reserve for the Nimpkish Band and that all present residents, who are not members of that Band be permitted to transfer therefor. The Nimpkish Band has already passed a resolution that they are willing to take in all present non-member residents and I understand from Agent Todd that the residents are quite willing to transfer to the Nimpkish Band.\n\nThe proposal seems fair enough in that in the first instance, if any Band has a right to the land in question, it would be the Nimpkish Band, and in the second place, the Reserves provided for the Nimpkish Band on the mainland are not as suitable for their means of livelihood as is the No. 1 Reserve on Cormorant Island which is too small to accommodate them.\n\nIt appears to the writer that there are two possible means of achieving the desired end and while one of the said methods presents many advantages over the other, it is proposed to mention both.\n\nIn the first instance, the Minute of Decision, approved on March 10th, 1891, set apart the 410 acres as \"Alert Bay Industrial School Reserve\" and in the normal course of events it may be assumed, I think, that the Provincial Government should have conveyed title to the Dominion for purposes of a school reserve and not in trust for .......... the Indians of the Province of British Columbia\" as provided in the 1893 conveyance. The actual conveyance of title was for an entirely different purpose than that for which the land was originally set aside and while it is possible that the Provincial authorities thought that as the school served Indians generally, the designation \"for the Indians of British Columbia\" was quite in order, nevertheless, for administration purposes there is a world of difference and it is submitted that the Province had no right or authority to alter the original purpose for which the land was set aside and certainly not without first securing the consent of the Dominion Government.\n\nIn short, therefore, it is possible that the Provincial Conveyance, in so far as it recites \"in trust for the Indians of the Province of British Columbia\" was ultra vires of the Province and if that were the case it would follow, I believe, that the Dominion would take title subject to a trust to use the land for the purpose for which it was originally set aside by the 1891 Minute of Decision - that is, for purposes of an Industrial School.\n\nIf the foregoing opinion is sound in law and we can, I assume, declare that part not being used by the school as surplus which would have the effect of retrotransferring title to the Province who have the reverent interest therein. Should it be arranged with the Province that, if we were to declare the land surplus for school purposes, we would have the first opportunity to repurchase it as a reserve for the Nimpkish Band and, as you are aware, under our present arrangement with the Province, we got such land at half price. While\n\n...........\nthis method might result in securing the land fairly cheaply, there are two objections to it, the first being that the Province might not view with favour our attempt to prove that their conveyance was incorrect. As you are aware, we cut the commercial timber on this property within the past few years, realizing several thousand dollars therefrom and if the true status of the property was determined to be school lands, we would have an awkward time explaining what right we had to cut and sell all the commercial timber.\n\nIt is considered that if the Department viewed the proposal of Agent Todd and the Indians with favour, the simplest method of bringing it into effect would be to accept the Provincial conveyance as sound in law, which it of course may be, and simply exercise our right therunder to sell the land or any portion thereof and deposit the proceeds to the credit of the Indians of British Columbia - that is, sell it on behalf of the Indians of British Columbia and purchase it ourselves to be set aside as a reserve for the Nimpkish Band. There would, of course, be no actual sale but merely an Order in Council setting out that the interest of the Indians of British Columbia in the said lands was being extinguished by the payment of so many dollars and that the land was hereby declared to be set apart for the use of the Nimpkish Band.\n\nBefore carrying into effect any such proposal it would, of course, be necessary to first ascertain the requirements of the school and also be certain as to whether any arrangement we may have with the school authorities is contrary to our proposal. In the second place, it would be necessary to ascertain what rate per acre should be paid for this land. While Agent Todd has suggested $5.00 an acre as being all that it is worth, now that the timber has been removed off it, I doubt very much whether this figure could be accepted as being a fair price and we shall have to be fairly certain that whatever price is paid would stand up to any criticism that might be levelled against us by some of the Indian organizations for disposing of the land too cheaply. It is possible that there may be some Provincial Crown land on the Island and that we might secure information as to general land values from the Province.\n\nIf the proposal is approved and direction is given to arrange the purchase of this land at a fair price, it will, of course, have to make provision for the money in the supplementary estimates for this year and a decision, one way or the other, should be secured at as early a date as is possible.\n\nL. Brown\n\nLB/ab\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Alert Bay Industrial School Reserve\n\nYour attention is directed to Mr. Brown's memorandum to the Superintendent of Reserves and Trusts hereunder.\n\nAfter many controversial years, 1891 to 1939, during which the legal ownership of the portion of Cormorant Island occupied by the Alert Bay Industrial School and certain Indians resident thereon, an agreement was reached with the Province pursuant to which the actual legal title was conveyed to the Crown Dominion in trust for the Indians of British Columbia, together with a conveyance of the right to deal with the property in such manner as would best serve the Indians and with specific permission to sell it and use the proceeds for the benefit of B.C. Indians.\n\nThis settlement, achieved by long and tedious negotiation with the Province, should not, in the judgment of the writer, be disturbed for any reason, technical or otherwise. The trust imposed by the document of conveyance (B.C. Order in Council No. 821 of June 21, 1939) conferred on the Dominion Government not only the right to deal with the property but to sell it and to use the proceeds for the benefit of the Indians of B.C. This it is submitted gives us full and ample authority to carve out of the lands conveyed to us the land actually required for school purposes and continue to use it as such.\n\nThe conditions of the trust are also broad enough to enable the Federal Government to transfer a sum of money properly representing the value of the balance of the lands which are surplus to school needs to a Trust Account to be used in the discretion of the Superintendent General to promote the interests of B.C. Indians in general, leaving the said balance of the lands free from the trust to be disposed of by the Superintendent General as he sees fit.\nThe said balance could then be transferred to the Nimpkish Band as an additional Reserve on such terms as the Superintendent General may approve. Such terms should be that the Nimpkish Band agrees to accept into its Band membership all Indians presently resident on the said lands and should agree to allot to such resident Indians the actual land and improvements which they presently enjoy, in order that location tickets may be issued to them in accordance with the terms of the Act, any residue of the land to be retained in Band ownership, subject to its right to allot it from time to time to Band members, as provided by the Act.\n\nThis arrangement, if approved, would necessitate (a) an appraisal of the value of the lands surplus to school requirements, and (b) a vote by Parliament of the sum of money representing the cash value of the lands.\n\nWhen the money had been voted and deposited in a Trust Account for the B.C. Indians generally, then by Order in Council the lands could be constituted an Indian Reserve for the Nimpkish Band and the necessary Band transfers and issue of location tickets effected.\n\nIt is suggested and recommended that an appraisal be made by Commissioner Arneil and Indian Agent Todd and that such appraisal be accepted as the value of the lands and the required sum be included in the Estimates so that the arrangement herein suggested can be carried out.\n\nThe above recommendations are respectfully submitted for approval.\n\nDJA/MC\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6429, file 875-9, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Alert Bay Industrial School Reserve\n\nFurther to my memorandum of February 3rd re the Alert Bay Industrial School Reserve, this matter has been discussed fully with Mr. M. S. Todd, the Indian Agent for the Kwawkewlth Agency. In addition to the representations made in the said memorandum of February 3rd, the following information is considered relevant and material.\n\nThe Nimpkish Band has a total population of 169 according to the last census. It has seven Reserves comprising in all approximately 557 acres. Only one of these Reserves is occupied by any Indians. Indian Reserve No. 1 which lies on Cormorant Island is only 45 acres in extent and all suitable land is occupied by Indians of the Band to the point where they are already greatly overcrowded, with no possibility of expansion within the limits of that Reserve.\n\nIn addition to the Indians of the Nimpkish Band there are many residents on Cormorant Island who have drifted in from other Bands and who have become firmly established for whom provision must be made somewhere. The Nimpkish Band has by resolution agreed to accept into its Band all these transients who have established permanent homes on Cormorant Island and these same people have expressed their desire and willingness to join the Nimpkish Band. The need, therefore, for further land is extremely urgent in order to preserve to the Indian owners the improvements that they have already made on lands to which they have no title.\n\nA further point that must be considered is that the Department has built a new day school to serve the Nimpkish Band on the subdivided portion of the industrial school lands and any difficulty in connection with title to the school property would be straightened out if the arrangement recommended were carried out.\nAgent Todd further reports that the Nimpkish Indians resident on Cormorant Island are a most progressive group, all of them engaged in the fishing industry and making very substantial incomes, a part of which they desire to spend in building homes and generally improving living conditions on the Island. As they are presently located it is virtually impossible for them to organize under a representative council, which it is their desire to do in order that they may provide themselves with water services, community hall and community playgrounds, and eventually with all the other services that go with an organized community. They have already electric services in their homes - many of them with hot and cold water - and naturally they want to have security of title to the lands and properties which they have so improved. The Indians themselves and Agent Todd are most anxious that this matter should proceed to a conclusion without delay, as they cannot and will not carry out their further development plans until the question of proper title to their lands can be assured to them.\n\nThe whole development programme has been carefully worked out with the full co-operation of the Indians concerned and is strongly recommended by this office. If the question of title to the lands can be worked out in accordance with the memorandum submitted for your attention, it will be necessary to have an immediate appraisal of the lands made and an item put in the Supplementary Estimates to buy out or extinguish the interest of the B.C. Indians in the property. With your approval, it is proposed to ask Commissioner Arneil and Agent Todd to make an immediate appraisal of the lands, supported by such evidence as to their findings as they can obtain locally.\n\nDirector.\n\nDJA/MC\nMarch 4, 1948.\n\nMr. T.

This area is well known to Mr. Todd, Indian Agent, and to Mr. A. C. C. Langstroth, Forest Ranger, Provincial Department of Lands and Forests. At a meeting today, in company with Mr. Todd and Mr. Langstroth, the valuation of this property was discussed.\n\nIt is our unanimous and considered opinion that the present day value of this property is $17,000.00, made up as follows:\n\n| Acres       | Value per acre | Total Value |\n|-------------|----------------|-------------|\n| 40 acres    | $200.00        | $8,000.00   |\n| 60 acres    | $2.50          | $150.00     |\n| 112 acres   | $26.50         | $2,968.00   |\n| 200 acres   | $29.00         | $5,800.00   |\n| 412 acres   | Estimated      | $16,918.00  |\n\np.t.o.\nMr. Langstroth considered it undesirable to sign any statement to this effect without the authority of his Department. It was not deemed necessary that such authority be obtained.\n\nIndian Agent Todd and myself confirmed the decision reached by Archdeacon Cook and myself on February 17th, 1948, in respect to that portion of Industrial School Reserve now occupied as a farm by the Residential School, which is to be retained and used for school purposes - this portion to be surveyed by a B.C.L.S. Immediate authority is therefore requested to have this survey made.\n\nMr. Allan and Mr. Brown are giving this matter high priority when the preliminary work is completed, which will enable them to prepare a request for sufficient money in the Supplementary Estimates to pay off the B.C. Indians. It is, therefore, imperative that we have the survey made and submitted to Ottawa at an early date to give them an opportunity to provide the funds in the Supplementary Estimates.\n\nThe whole program of development on this Reserve is being held in abeyance until such time as this matter is concluded.\n\n(W.

Alert Bay.\n\nWe might point out in this connection that certain sizes of Fir are very difficult to obtain at present. The item of 1 x 12 is practically non-existent in so far as the mills are concerned at present, and on orders calling for 1 x 12, all we can do is to accumulate a little at a time, and, therefore, we would be able to make prompt shipment. Regarding the Clear Cedar items it is very hard to tell you what kind of shipment could be made until we have a firm specification of just what you would require.\n\nRegarding the items of Yellow Cedar and Pine, we regret very much we are unable to quote you prices until we have a specification of the sizes which you require.

There is very little of these two items available at present as all the mills are very busy cutting Fir for war orders.

We feel that good work is being done at this school but it is considered that the Principal should be able to give us some idea of the value of the material that he requires. It is not necessary to obtain detailed prices but a reasonably accurate estimate is all we need to enable us to decide what amount can be allowed this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D.M.

This has necessitated revision of the requisition and the obtaining of new estimates which has meant a great deal of work.\n\nI would approve of Mr. Anfield's suggestion that the Department advise this office of the amount to be sanctioned for manual training supplies, so that requisitions may be prepared and forwarded not to exceed the allotted amount.\n\nWe would appreciate an early reply so that requisitions may be prepared at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMajor D.M.

We could then base our requisitions on this sum and save asking firms to bid on projects or supplies only to have them cancelled out through lack of funds.

This appears to be quite a high amount. Is this paint used for repair work around the school or is it used only for manual training purposes?\n\nThe Department approves the purchase of the other items but would like to have more information in regard to the paint. On receipt of this information the balance of the requisition will be considered.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPhilip Phelps\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. M.

C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith requisition received from Mr. Indian Agent Todd for the purchase of lumber, tools and hardware for Manual Training purposes for St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay at a total cost of $378.57. This was the subject of discussion in your letter of June 30, 1941, your file 156-0-11, wherein you required a reasonably accurate estimate of the school's requirements in this connection in order to enable you to decide what amount could be allowed for this purpose.\n\nIf funds are available, I would recommend approval of the application.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. F. EARL ANFIELD, S.M.\nPrincipal\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nST. MICHAEL'S SCHOOL\nAlert Bay, B. C.\n\nSeptember 8th, 1941\n\nSir:\n\nAnswering yours of the 4th regarding Manual Training Supplies requisitioned for the use of this School, this list has been carefully scrutinized and it is necessary to advise you that the following amount of paint therein would be used for repair work and maintenance work around the School:\n\n| Quantity | Description       | Cost   |\n|----------|------------------|--------|\n| 10 Gals. | Green house paint| $30.43 |\n| 2 gals   | Cream            | $6.08  |\n| 1 gal.   | Grey             | $3.04  |\n| 4 gals   | Turpentine       | $5.72  |\n| 1 gal.   | Outside flat white| $3.89  |\n| 1 gal.   | \" black          | $3.05  |\n| 1 gal.   | \" green          | $3.04  |\n| Total    | 20 gals.         | $54.65 |\n\nThese quantities and amounts may be deleted from the requisition as placed, should the Department be unable to meet the cost of the full requisition. It is difficult to know just where to draw the line between strictly Manual Training projects and maintenance and repair work around the School.\n\nAs you know we place a great deal of value on practical work for our boys and our program is based on a series of projects, many of them practical and of a permanent value to the School structure and equipment. For example we plan this year on considerable ornamental fencing around the Preventorium. It is true that this is maintenance of the School property, and yet itself very strictly a Manual Training project. Last year we rebuilt all the ornamental fences of the School and a new entrance, and some of the paint requisitioned was for the completion and painting of this work during the present school year.\n\nIt has always seemed to me of more value for the boys to be making useful practical things than spending their time making little models as is done in the Provincial Schools.\n\nWith the deletion of the paint quoted herewith, the balance of the requisition will be required for definite Manual Training purposes or initial projects therein.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nFEA/M\nPrincipal\nOttawa,\nSeptember 25, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant you may purchase the additional 20 gallons of paint requested by the Principal of the Alert Bay Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI would refer you to my letter 15/6/3565 of August 11, 1941, and to your reply 156-0-11 of August 21st last. An explanation was requested through Mr. Indian Agent Todd of the Kwawkewlth Agency with respect to the purpose for which the paint requisition was required.\n\nI am forwarding herewith a letter of explanation from Mr. F. E. Anfield, Principal of St. Michael's Indian Residential School, dated September 8, and of Mr. Todd's covering letter, dated September 13 last, for the information of the Department.\n\nThe last paragraph of Departmental Letter 156-0-11 of August 21st, leaves me in some doubt as to whether authority has been given to me to proceed with the purchase of the balance of the requisition, 20 gallons of paint, as itemized in Mr. Anfield's letter of the 8th instant, needed for repair and maintenance, having now been deleted from the original requisition.\n\nI should, therefore, appreciate receiving confirmation from the Department that the purchase of the other items is approved.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Todd, Indian Agent, Alert Bay, B.C.\n\nOn July 25 last the Department forwarded purchase order No. 13791 to Marshall-Wells B.C. Limited, Vancouver, for manual training equipment for the Alert Bay Residential School. As the accounts had not been received by the 1st instant we wrote to the Principal and he states that Marshall-Wells was finally instructed to cancel some items that seemed difficult to obtain and that the invoices for the materials that had been supplied were certified and sent to you on December 11 last. It would be appreciated if you would attach the accounts to proper voucher forms and forward them to this office at once in order that payment can be made from the current year's appropriation.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nFEB. 9, 1943.\n\nDepartment Mines & Resources\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe your 156-0-11 of February 1st, re account Marshall-Wells B. C. Ltd. Manual Training Equipment, purchase order #13791.\n\nThese goods were ordered as stated in your letter and most of them came forward in August and September. A considerable number of items were back ordered for various priority reasons, and the material and covering invoices kept trickling in, making it difficult to complete the requisition. Marshall-Wells was finally instructed to cancel outstanding items and the invoices were certified and sent to Mr. Indian Agent Todd, together with the purchase order Dec. 11th, 1942. It is regretted that this matter could not be concluded sooner, but conditions as previously stated made this impossible.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\nOttawa,\nFebruary 1, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn July 25 last the Department forwarded purchase order No. [1379] to Marshall-Wells B.C. Limited, Vancouver, for manual training equipment for the Alert Bay Residential School. A copy of the purchase order was sent to Indian Commissioner Mackay on July 27 last and presumably he has forwarded it to you. No doubt the goods have been received, but you have not yet forwarded the account. It would be appreciated if you would forward the account covering the cost of the goods delivered as a result of this purchase order at the earliest possible date, in order that payment can be made from our current year's appropriation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo, the Department approves an expenditure of $125.00 for tools and material for the manual training class at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. When forwarding accounts, you should attach a copy of your purchase order.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the requisition includes 16 gallons of outside paint and slightly over 5 gallons of interior paint. It is somewhat difficult for us to understand why such large quantities of paint come under the heading \"Supplies for Manual Training\". It almost looks as if these items should be charged to the amount allowed for repairs and improvements.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Todd's letter of the 11th instant forwarding that of Mr. F.E. Anfield of June 7th addressed to him, together with a requisition for manual training tools and material for the Alert Bay Residential School, at a cost of $125.00, if purchased in accordance with the lowest tender which is that of Messrs. Marshall-Wells Limited.\n\nIf funds can be provided for this purpose, I would recommend approval of the application.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJune 11, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, BC.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find copy of letter from Principal Anfield of the Alert Bay Residential School, together with Requisition for supplies for the Manual Training Division of the school. The materials required are those listed on the attached quotations, of which that of Marshall-Wells B.C. Limited of Vancouver is the lowest figure, and I would recommend that the order be placed with them.\n\nIt is noted Principal Anfield is obtaining prices on lumber for manual training purposes, and this will be forwarded when received.\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\nIndian Agent\nALERT BAY B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nAttached please find bids from the following firms for Manual Training supplies at this School.\n\n1. Marshall-Wells B. C. Ltd.\n2. McLennan McFeely & Prior Ltd.\n3. Gordon & Beylea Ltd.\n\nIt is noted that Marshall-Wells bid is the lowest to wit $126.00.\n\nWe are endeavouring to get bids on 2 M. feet Board Measure, Manual Training lumber, and these will be forwarded when received.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\n\nJUNE 7, 1943\nIndian Agent\nAlert Bay B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nRe Manual Training Lumber. Bids were called for from three firms, the Alberta Lumber Co., H. J. Wells, and Telegraph Cove Mills Ltd.\n\nThe Alberta Lumber Co. stated that they were unable to bid; H. J. Wells refused to bid on specified quantities, but were willing if we were able to get a priority order to try and round up 2 M. feet random lengths and sizes of lumber suitable for manual training, though could not give a price.\n\nTelegraph Cove Mills has in stock a small amount of lumber mostly kiln dried, which was taken over by the Airforce. They are not particularly anxious to sell this lumber, but in view of our extreme difficulty in securing supplies they have consented to release it, and attached please find their tender for the amount $274.36\n\nThe amount specified would take care of two years normal manual training requirements, and in view of the fact it will undoubtedly be more difficult next year to obtain lumber than this, I would ask consideration of the Department to purchase the entire amount, which we will conserve to the limit. We will guarantee not to request any lumber for manual training purposes next year. We would be willing to buy half of this from School funds, but our operating costs are so tremendously high that it is impossible to consider this under present conditions.\n\nIf the Department is absolutely unable to purchase the full amount as two years' supplies, it is requested that they purchase 50% of the amount quoted upon for half the quoted price.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa,\nJuly 20, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.\nBox 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter of\nthe 14th instant, it has been decided to authorize\nyou to purchase lumber for the vocational training\nclass at the Alert Bay Residential School to an\namount of $274.36. Payment of this will be made\nfrom the B.C. Special account and when forwarding\nthe voucher you should attach copy of your purchase\norder.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Todd's letter of the 8th instant forwarding application from the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School for manual training material amounting to $274.36 of which Mr. Indian Agent Todd is prepared to recommend only half of the amount as the quantity applied for is intended to cover two years' requirements of the school.\n\nI am inclined to agree with the Principal that in view of the considerable and increasing difficulty in securing manual training lumber that it would be advisable to purchase the supply available on the understanding that no request will be made for same next year. Whether this could be done would, of course, depend on funds being available and the matter is submitted to you on that basis.\n\nI do not consider that manual training is being carried out on too large a scale at this school considering the pupilage. There is no doubt that Mr. Anfield's work at this institution has been highly successful and I do not agree with Mr. Todd's opinion that there should be any suspension of manual training but feel that the work should be extended rather than curtailed.\n\nD.M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJuly 8, 1943.\n\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., Department of Mines & Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nThe enclosed requisition covering lumber for manual training requirements at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School as per the attached quotations submitted by Principal Anfield, is being forwarded for your attention. This requisition is in addition to that forwarded on June 11th last for hardware supplies for the manual training.\n\nIt is noted Principal Anfield is recommending the purchase of two years' supply on the chance that it may be impossible to purchase material next year, and the list covered by the quotation from Telegraph Cove Mills Limited is for that period. In this connection, I cannot agree, and can only recommend that fifty percent of the material quoted be supplied, which would serve the requirements for one year. In fact I feel when money is so difficult to obtain and needed so urgently for the war effort, that the Department could well dispense with manual training on a large scale for the duration.\n\n(M.

(RC 10, Volume 6429, file 875-11, part 3)\nIndian Commissioner for B. C., Department of Mines and Resources, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nAttached please find correspondence received from Rev. S. J. Wickens, Principal of St. Michael's Indian Residential School, Alert Bay, in which he is requesting the Department to increase the grant to the Manual Training Instructor.\n\nAt the present time the Department is giving a grant of $480.00 a year towards the Manual Training Instructor's salary. From Principal Wickens' letter it would appear the School is supplementing this amount $20.00 a month, and the present salary now stands at $720.00 per year.\n\nIt is also noted that Mr. Wickens suggests his salary be increased to $75.00 per month, plus his room and board.\n\nPersonally, I do not think this is enough. As this is one very important phase of our training I feel the Department should assume the full responsibility of the salary and I do not think that it is possible to obtain the services of a satisfactory Manual Training Instructor unless he receives a salary sufficient to attract him to the position.\n\nIn my opinion he should receive $100.00 a month, plus his room and board. We should have a highly trained instructor to fill this position, and unless we are prepared to pay a fair wage we will not be able to obtain a satisfactory instructor. I also believe the appointment of this Manual Training Instructor should be the responsibility of our School Inspector. In view of the above I wish to make the following recommendations:\n\n(1) The Indian Affairs Branch establish a salary of $100.00 a month plus room and board for the Manual Training Instructor.\n\np.t.o.\nMr. M.S. Todd,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nInspector Davey in his report on our School was not satisfied with the work being done by our Manual Training Instructor and recommended that a change should be made. I, too, had previously decided that more efficient instruction of our boys in woodwork was highly desirable. The present occupant of this position was appointed during the war years when competent instructors were not available. He has done his best, but I grant that now it is not good enough.\n\nHowever, if we are to attract a more competent man as Instructor, I think we should offer more than $60.00 per month. I am now looking for a man that will produce work more satisfactory to ourselves and the Inspector. I would strongly recommend that the grant be increased so that I may offer $75.00 per month to a qualified Instructor. We are all aware of the emphasis that the Department is rightfully placing on the training of our boys in carpentry, and, I think it is generally agreed that the salary should be more commensurate to the efficiency demanded.\n\nI feel that when the adverse report on our Manual Training Department is studied by Ottawa, they will insist on a change being made, and I believe they will favourably consider an increase such as I have suggested.\n\nThanking you for past favours,\n\nI am, Yours very truly,\n\nS.J.

Box 70,\nVancouver, British Columbia.\n\nWe have your letter of August 26th, with reference to the proposed establishment of a Manual Training class at the Alberni Residential School.\n\nYour letter has been brought to Mr. Doucet's attention and he will discuss the matter with you when he is in British Columbia.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/HM\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nEnclosed are copies of a file of correspondence in connection with the proposed establishment of a Mechanical Training Course at Alert Bay Indian Residential School, together with a Memorandum from School Inspector Davey.\n\nIt is proposed to discuss this matter with Mr. Doucet during his visit to the Coast this fall.\n\nD. M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTO: Indian Commissioner for B.C. Vancouver, B.C., June 30, 1947.\n\nFROM: School Inspector.\n\nre: Alert Bay Indian Residential School\n\nEnclosed is correspondence from Mr. Indian Agent Todd and myself concerning the institution of a mechanical training course at the above-mentioned Residential School, along with an outline of proposed course of studies.\n\nWhen I inspected the Alert Bay School I suggested to the Principal that a course of this nature would be most useful for the pupils of his School.\n\nIt is noted that the cost of the tools which would be required for this purpose would amount to approximately $325.00 and, in addition to this, a building will be necessary. The Principal of the School estimates that the cost of this building would be in the neighbourhood of $1200.00. The total cost then for instituting this program would be approximately $1600.00.\n\nAs the majority of the pupils at this School will enter either the fishing or lumbering industry, in which the operation of engines occupies an important place, I consider that this type of vocational work would be of great value to the pupils. I feel that the type of work as indicated in the course is what is required but there are no doubt some changes which should be made. In this connection I believe the Correspondence Branch of the Department of Education for the Province of British Columbia has courses along these lines and it might be possible to use them as a guide in developing this work.\n\nThe Alert Bay School already has gasoline engines in operating order which will be available for this work when the School connects up with the Power Commission electric lighting plant at Alert Bay so there would be no expenditure\nfor this. In addition to this the School also has an old Diesel engine which is not in use and upon which the boys could work.\n\nIn view of the anticipated visit to the Coast by Mr. Doucet in the fall, the Department might feel it advisable to leave this matter until he had had an opportunity to discuss this with me.\n\nR.

Wickens, Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School in connection with a proposed increase in the grant allowed for the employment of a manual training instructor.\n\nA memorandum dated May 10th from District School Inspector Davey is enclosed wherein he recommends that the grant be increased to $85.00 per month for a part time instructor with some qualifications or $100 for a full time manual training instructor. I concur in the recommendation made by Inspector Davey but consider that the amount of the grant should be flexible in order that the salary for the position may be changed to meet the qualifications of the candidates from time to time; these candidates to be secured by the Reverend Principal.\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMay 10, 1947\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nto The Indian Commissioner for B.C.\nfrom The Inspector of Indian Schools\n\nRe: Application for Increased Grant,\nManual Training Instructor's Salary.\n\nI refer to the application of Reverend S.J. Wickens for an increase in the grant toward the Manual Training Instructor's salary at the St. Michael's Residential School and the letter from Mr. Indian Agent loud in support of this application.\n\nIn my report on the Vocational training at the St. Michaels Residential School I indicated that the Vocational Training at this school is extremely weak. I also discussed this with the Principal and pointed out to him that there should be considerable improvement in this work. In order to do this the school will certainly have to pay more for a suitable Manual Training Instructor than the present amount of $60.00 per month. At the time of my inspection at the beginning of March there were 114 boys in residence which indicates that a full time instructor could be used for vocational training. I recommend that the grant be made on the basis of $55.00 per month for a part time instructor with some qualifications, or $100.00 per month for a full time Manual Training Instructor.\n\nIt is very doubtful if the school will be able to obtain an instructor who has both the practical and professional training, but if Mr. Wickens is fortunate enough to secure such a man an additional amount of $25.00 per month should be made if his professional standing warrants it.\n\nRegarding the recommendation of Mr. Todd that the Manual Training Instructor be appointed by the departmental School Inspector, I should like to point out that\nit is impossible for me to do my regular work of inspection and at the same time make contacts in view of filling vacancies in the Residential Schools, and I do not consider that the Department's policy with regard to this should be changed, at least until another inspector is appointed for this district. At present the Department reviews appointments to such positions and bases the salary grant on the qualifications of the instructor. It is my opinion that this is the only practical manner of handling the problem at the present time.\n\nThe Department is at the present time reviewing the grants for Manual Training Instructors' salaries in B.C. and is considering basing them along the lines recommended here.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools\n| DATE   | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Sept. 30 | Department grant towards the salary of the Manual Training Instructor at the Alert Bay Residential School for the quarter ended Sept. 30th, 1947, @ $5.00 per teaching month. | $5.00  |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

I have now received his reply which is as follows:\n\n\"When my Manual Training Instructor arrived at the School he was very disappointed with the equipment provided in the work shop. I myself, as did Inspector Davey, knew that the condition of the tools was very poor, and the equipment very limited. The Instructor advised me that it was impossible to commence Manual Training classes without immediate reconditioning of the tools which would require a grinder. He also demanded a supply of lumber immediately in order to proceed with the pupils' classes. I felt justified, therefore, in proceeding to purchase both a grinder and lumber. I did not communicate with the Head Office as at that time I was under the impression that Mr. Forward was away and no one appointed to take his place. In the past four years I have very rarely made such a purchase at such short notice, but I felt the situation justified the decision. The grinder arrived, has been used, and many of the tools reconditioned. I have discussed the matter with the Indian Agent and I am forwarding to him a request that the Department be prepared to cover the purchase of this item.\n\nI quite realize that so far as your procedure goes, the method of procurement was irregular but, in view of the fact that it was obtained for the purpose of keeping Manual Training tools in good condition, perhaps you could see your way clear to paying the account.

It will be noted that the principal has requested two sewing machines. In this connection Inspector Davey, who recently visited the school reports that the school has three machines, two of which are in very poor condition and the number is insufficient for the number of pupils taking sewing classes. The two machines in poor condition can be overhauled and will be suitable for rough work but an additional two should be supplied.\n\nAlso included in the requisition is a request for an electric iron. Many of the reservations along the Coast from which the pupils are admitted have electricity and it is considered that this item should be supplied to this school.\n\nIt will be noted that the other items are for instructional purposes and not school clothing.\n\nIt is considered that the expenditure required for all of these items is a legitimate charge against the B.C. Special Vote and it is recommended that authorization be given for their purchase.\n\nW.S.

(RG 10, Volume 6429, file 875-14, part 1)\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn answer to your letter of June 8th, regarding the purchase of a good working horse for the Alert Bay Industrial School, I have just had a consultation with Mr. Lord, the Principal of the school, and he is writing to a reputable firm in Vancouver to find out what a suitable horse would cost. I have made requisition to be allowed to take the launch to Vancouver for repairs and expect to be there about the 7th or 8th of July and will be able to select a suitable horse for the work. Judging from prices advertised in the papers a horse of the weight and quality suitable for their work would cost in the neighborhood of $250, to which would be added freight possibly $10 or $12. I would recommend that I be given authority to make this purchase while in Vancouver but there would not be time for an answer to be received at this office by mail and I would respectfully suggest that this authority be sent by wire.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJune 8th, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Halliday,\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo enclosing letter from the Rev. Principal of the Albert Bay industrial school, in which he asks that the Department supply the institution with a good working horse. While the general policy of the Department is that these schools should supply their own stock, I am disposed under the circumstances to assist Mr. Lord to this extent. Will you please let me know what an animal such as Mr. Lord wishes to secure would cost.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing a letter from the Principal of the Alert Bay Industrial School making application for a grant to purchase a horse to do the work on the farm attached to the school.\n\nI would beg to report favorably on this application. Heretofore there has not been nearly enough attention given to clearing land and keeping it under proper cultivation. Mr. Todd, the Trade Instructor of the School, is a practical farmer and has been doing good work in this capacity since he has been taking care of the work at the Industrial School. Strictly speaking the school should have 20 or 40 acres of land under cultivation but the land is heavy to clear and with so many other things to attend to in the way of work progress in this line has been very slow. When the committee of the Missionary Society of the Church in Canada were at Alert Bay I took the matter up with them and recommended that they should have more land cleared so as to enable the school to be more self-supporting besides giving better instruction to the boys and they intended to take this up with the parent committee at Toronto. Venerable Arch Deacon Snowden of Ottawa was one of the committee who visited at Alert Bay.\n\nI think if a good big sensible horse was provided for the use of the school it would be a matter of great assistance to them.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to request that you will give your best consideration to this, my application for a grant to purchase a horse, to do the work on the farm attached to this school.\n\nWe have found it necessary to put away the only horse we had, on account of old age, and he has been really unfit for work for some time. He has been used continually by the school for twelve years, and was about 25 years old.\n\nOwing to the development of the farm in late years, we need a good animal, weighing about 1500 lbs to handle the work, or I would suggest the purchase of a mare in foal, with a view to raising the colt for work in the future.\n\nThe service of a horse is absolutely necessary to work the farm, and we should be severely handicapped without one in cultivating and harvesting our crop this year.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThrough:-\nW.M. Halliday Esq:\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay B.C.\n\nPrincipal.\nSEND the following NIGHT LETTER subject to the terms printed on the back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nOTTAWA, July 5th, 1921.\n\nW. M. Halliday,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nMay purchase suitable horse at reasonable cost for Alert Bay Industrial School. Animal should be examined by veterinary surgeon and certificate obtained. Forward vouchers for payment.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nWith further reference to your letter of June 8th, and to my letter of June 24th with regard to the purchase of a horse for the Alert Bay Industrial School, I beg to advise you that I have not yet received any answer to my communication of the 24th.\n\nWhile I was in Vancouver, during the second week in July, I made a special point of visiting the sales stables of J. Hanbury & Co., to look over their horses and have an idea as to prices, etc., but as I had not received any authority to make the purchase I did not do so. I found that I could obtain horses from $250 to $300 each. I picked one out at $200, which I considered to be the best buy of any horses he had for sale. The horse was rising seven and was a splendid animal in every particular but was too slow for their work at teaming in the city which would be a valuable asset to the horse for the purpose for which he is intended. I was shown another good horse about 100 lbs. lighter at $250, guaranteed perfectly sound but had a blemish on each leg in the shape of a wind gall. From my own experience while farming in British Columbia the wind gall does not interfere at any time with the working qualities of the horse but seriously interferes with him from a sales point of view. The great difficulty in getting a horse for the work here is in getting one that will stand working without wearing shoes as most horses of that weight are used to wearing coiled shoes. In order that the horse may go bare footed he requires to have good hoofs and the first horse mentioned had exceptionally good feet. I am awaiting your instructions with regard to purchasing a horse and Mr. Lord, the principal, is anxious that the purchase should be made as soon as possible, as they have their hay stacked outside waiting for the horse to draw it to the barn.\n\nIn each of the above instances the price of the horse included a well fitting collar.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOTTAWA, August 2nd, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo with reference to the purchase of a horse for the Alert Bay Industrial School.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that your letter of the 24th of June was received, and a reply was sent you by telegram on the 5th ultimo, as follows:\n\n\"May purchase suitable horse at reasonable cost for Alert Bay Industrial School. Animal should be examined by veterinary surgeon and certificate obtained. Forward vouchers for payment.\"\n\nThis message was sent you as you stated in your letter of the above date that you were leaving for Vancouver, and it was hoped that it would reach you before you left Alert Bay.\n\nYou may, therefore, make the necessary arrangements to carry out the instructions contained in the above quoted telegram, and arrange for the purchase of a suitable horse for this school. While a serviceable horse for the purposes required should be secured, it is expected that such will be obtained as cheaply as possible. You should forward properly receipted vouchers, in duplicate, for payment after you have arranged for the purchase of a horse which has been approved by a veterinary, as sound, and you should attach his certificate to that effect to the vouchers which you forward for payment.\n\nI may say that it is regretted that the telegram above referred to did not reach you before you left Alert Bay on your recent visit to Vancouver.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nI talked with the Principal about his milch cows. They are a poor bunch. They do not come of a milking strain. I advised him to gradually get rid of what he has and put in their place two good cows. Turn the present cows into beef. Two good grade cows would give much more milk than the six he has at present.\n\n(Sgd.) R. H. Cairns.\nOTTAWA, March 8th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns, in a report on his inspection of the Alert Bay Industrial and Girls' boarding school in February, last, states that the milch cows kept give a very small supply of milk, and that he has advised the Principal to get rid of them and obtain a better grade of cows.\n\nHe also draws attention to the quantity of milk used at the girls' school. He states that in January, last, only 45 gallons of milk were produced, 7 of which were sold, also that 10 pounds of butter were made, 5 of which were sold.\n\nThis is quite an inadequate supply of milk for the use of the pupils. Milk should form one of the main items of diet, especially for the younger children, and you should take up with the Principal the matter of obtaining a sufficient number of good milch cows to supply the pupils with an adequate supply of milk each day.\n\nOwing to the small quantity of milk at present produced, it should be used for the benefit of the pupils, and none should be sold. This also applies to the butter made.\n\nI will be pleased if you will consult the Principal regarding the obtaining of more milch cows, and inform the Department as to what he proposes to do in this matter, as milk should be served to the pupils, especially the younger ones, at each meal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOttawa, August 28, 1922.\n\nSir:\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant. With reference to the purchase of the two Holstein grade cows for the use of the Alert Bay Industrial School, I beg to say that the Department will approve of your obtaining these cows from your brother, Mr. E. A. Halliday, of Kingcome Inlet. It is noted that he is the only farmer within a large radius of the school, from whom you can procure these cows, also that his herd is entirely free from disease. We note that the price asked is $100 for each animal, delivered at the school.\n\nIn view of the cost of delivering these animals, the Department considers the above price reasonable. You should, therefore, arrange to have these two cows which you have selected delivered at the school, as soon as possible. You will kindly furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of them.\n\nRegarding the removal of the small cottage, I beg to say that, as you were advised in official letter of the 17th instant, we have paid an account to the amount of $150 for the expense incurred in moving this cottage.\n\nIn connection with the beds and mattresses required, a list of which you have submitted, stating the sizes, I have to inform you that the purchase of these will receive attention. We are obtaining competitive prices and will place the order with the firm quoting us the lowest price. You will be advised later as to the name of the firm which will supply these goods.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 25th dealing with recommendations from Rev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, I beg to advise you that within a radius of some 70 or 80 miles from Alert Bay there is only one farmer who has a herd of grade Holstein cattle and that is my brother, Mr. E. A. Halliday of Kingcome Inlet. Mr. Lawrence Landsdowne of Kingcome Inlet has a few grade Holsteins but none for sale. After receipt of your letter I had an opportunity to go to Kingcome Inlet before making any decision about the purchase of these cows and as it happens to be my brother with whom I was dealing, I wish to bring the matter to the attention of the Department before making any final arrangements as there might be a suggestion that I was using my position as Indian Agent to negotiate sales for a member of my family.\n\nHe has a herd of 26 milch cows and is in a dairy business in fact he makes his living entirely from the sale of butter and beef. There is no veterinary nearer than Vancouver but in order to ensure that his herd is free from disease every other year he applies to the Provincial Government Veterinary Surgeon and has him examine the whole herd. The last examination was made on August 4, 1931 by W. W. Alton, Veterinary Inspector for the Province of British Columbia and during this inspection he administered the tuberculosis test to all the cattle and found them free from disease. I have in my possession this report which deals with the two cows which I have selected for purchase subject to the approval of the Department.\n\nMy brother has now purchased his 5th pedigree Holstein bull, the last three having been bought from the Provincial Government Colony Farm and their cows have made a record for milk and butter test for the whole of Canada. The difficulty in the way is the transportation and I have told him that the Department should not consider any other terms than that they be delivered at the school at Alert Bay. It will cost him $100.00 to deliver the two animals as he will have to charter a gasoline tug and now to bring them over but he will guarantee delivery for $100.00 for each animal. I may say that Mr. Landsdowne his near neighbor has just bought a grade Holstein cow in Vancouver and it cost him landed at Kingcome Inlet $125.00 and in my estimation it is not as good an animal as either of the two I selected. One of these gives a butter test of 4.1 and the other 4.3 % butter fat and while not particularly heavy milkers are long seasoned cows. One of them is 4 years old and the other one 6 and both are due to calve early in the year, the calves being from his latest imported Holstein bull from the Government farm.\n\nIf this is not suitable to the Department it may be necessary for me to take a trip to Vancouver and see what can be done in the way of purchasing as there are no good milch cows of any kind to be obtained in the near vicinity.\nWith regard to the second paragraph of your recommendation regarding beds I took the matter up with Mr. Lord, principal of the school, and personally went through the dormitory and examined every bed and I would recommend that 25 complete beds with springs size 2 ft. 6 X 6 purchased and four springs 7 ft. X 6 and 5 springs 6 ft. 6 X 6 be purchased to complete some of the other beds of the Dominion link fabric type as are in use at the present time and I would further recommend that 40 mattresses be obtained size 3 ft. 6 X 6. In looking over the beds I found that the best service had been given by the mattress known as the \"people's favorite\" made in Waterville, Quebec, by George Galt. These have been in use for a number of years and it is possible that the firm is no longer in operation but they have stood the test well and after all these years many of them are in a fair state of preservation.\n\nWith regard to a request that the school cottage for which a grant of $150.00 was recently made for repairs and which is being used as a residence for the principal, I had to advise you that Mr. Lord has already had the cottage moved and paid $150.00 on a contract for having it moved and set up in its new place. With regard to this cottage I may say that Mr. Lord approached me on the matter of a grant towards the moving of it but I explained to him that the department had just completed repairing and refitting the house at an expense of $250.00 and that I was making the application for these repairs that there had been no thought or suggestion that the building be moved. I pointed out to him that to a certain extent it meant a waste of a portion of the funds as all the under pinnings would have to be taken away and replaced and repainted and I thought if he did not know what he wanted any better than that that there was no particular reason for moving the house.\n\nWith regard to the paragraph in your letter stating that the house was situated right in the seepage of the bog in which lies behind the ridge on which the schools are built I beg to say that this is not correct. The cottage as it was was in a very good situation and is just as healthy a place as it is at the present time. I was rather opposed to the moving of the building on the ground that I intended to ask for an entirely new school for the Industrial School and that consequently quarters for the principal would be arranged for at that time. Under the circumstances however as the cottage has already been moved at a contract price of $150.00 I would recommend that this amount be repaid to Dr. Westgate who made the necessary advance to Mr. Lord to have the work done.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to past correspondence in connection with the purchase of a horse for the Alert Bay Industrial school I beg to advise you that Mr. W. F. Todd, Trade Instructor for the school, during his holiday went to Vancouver and looked the city over for a suitable horse for their requirements. He purchased one from J. Hanbury & Co. for $200.00 paying cash for it for Mr. Vivian S. Lord, Principal of the Alert Bay Industrial school. When the authority came to purchase the horse I at once notified Mr. Lord but as the veterinary surgeon who had examined the horse had gone East on a purchasing expedition the account could not be sent in until his return and the forwarding of the certificate. The freight on the horse was $9.75 and I am enclosing you Voucher No. 71 for $209.75 in favor of Mr. Lord in payment of the above.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nVancouver, B.C.\nSept. 21, 1921.\n\nThis is to certify that I have examined one Dapple Grey Horse sold by J.

He states that during the week of his visit butter was being made at the expense of the supply of milk furnished for the pupils. He states that he discussed the food value of whole milk, and urged the Principal not to make any butter while there was such a small quantity of milk.\n\nLast summer authority was given for the purchase of two Holstein grade cows for the use of this school, in order to provide an ample supply of milk for the daily requirements of the pupils. The Principal should realize the value of whole milk as an item of diet especially for the younger children.\n\nI have to request that you will draw this matter to the attention of the Principal, and inform him that the Department requires that the pupils, especially the growing children, will receive an ample supply of milk at their meals, daily.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear from you after you have had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nDAIRY:\n\n2\u00bd lbs. of butter were made this week, but this was done at the expense of the pupils, who received no whole milk during the week. I discussed very thoroughly the food value of the whole milk and urged the principal of this school not to make any butter while he had such a small quantity of milk. Most of the Principals of our residential schools do not realize the value of whole milk for growing children and I am placing great emphasis on this subject, in my conference with these men.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF R.

CAIRNS\nON ALERT BAY INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL\nORIGINAL ON FILE 116947-6\nDATED DEC. 11th, 1922.\n\nDRAINAGE:\n\nThe drainage is the same as on previous visits, however, the Principal is not satisfied with the drains at present. Dr. Wilson, the Medical Health Officer, has also condemned the present drainage system. From what I could learn some new traps are needed to make the drains safe. I do not think there will be any great expense connected with the repairs needed. I would advise that the Principal be urged to attend to this matter at once.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, British Columbia\n\nTo: E. A.

Another delay occurred on account of not being able to get a boat to tow the scow from Kingcome Inlet to Alert Bay. The cows have now been delivered however and are in good condition.

You are authorized to purchase from Mr. R. U. Hurford the pure bred Jersey 2-year-old, which can be secured for $125, f. o. b. Campbell River. You may give Mr. Hurford the option on the animal that he requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B. C.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of May 15th regarding a report and recommendation in connection with the purchase of a new bull for the Alert Bay Indian Residential Schools I am sorry that the report has been so long in being forwarded but it was difficult for some time to get in touch with anyone who had animals of this nature for sale.\n\nI wrote to the Colony Farm at Esquimalt, to the Agricultural Branch of the University of British Columbia and to the Dominion Experimental Farm and also looked at one or two bulls in this vicinity. I also wrote to Mr. brother, Mr. R. M. Macdonald who is one of the leading dairyman in Comox Valley. In reply to these letters the Provincial Master Breeder is willing to provide a young bull \"Colonel Arctic Champion\" born February 3rd, 1926. They state that he is an excellent calf, big and bright and from good producing and high buttering stock. His two nearest dams average 2,487 pounds of butter per year. Price subject to prior sale $150.00 F.O.B. Vancouver.\n\nThe Dominion Experimental Farm at Agassiz has a very fine young bull calf born January 10th, 1926, which they are planning to show at the Vancouver Exhibition and also at the New Westminster Exhibition. His sire is the son of Agassiz's Begle Bay Echo, the world's champion cow that produced 20,366 pounds of milk and 1,061 pounds of butter in a year. The dam of the calf produced 19,960 pounds of milk and 760 pounds of butter in a year. The price on this calf is $200.00 subject to being unheld when they hear again from this office.\n\nThey also refer me to Mr. C. A. Milliner, 2900 Marine Drive, Vancouver, who has a young bull of the same breeding as the one above mentioned. He is by the same sire and his dam as a two year old produced 16,522 pounds of milk and 708 pounds of butter and her dam in turn produced 19,925 pounds of milk and 974 pounds of butter in a year. She has three registered sisters that produced over 20,000 pounds of milk in a year. The Superintendent writes that while he has never seen this bull he thinks it could be purchased from $150.00 to $200.00. These animals are all three Holsteins.\n\nMy brother took up the matter in the Comox Valley with Mr. R. H. Harford who handles Jerseys. He says that he has a fine yearling pure bred Jersey to be two years old this Fall. This bull is from Brampton Mariposa, of Grinnell Bros., Tender Island, whose record is 666 pounds of butter fat as a four year\nis very creditable. Brampton Mariposa is a regular producer and Grinnell Bros. figure her the best cow they ever owned. The bull is very nice to handle and was shown at the Fair in Vancouver, and Courtenay was the Junior Champion Bull. He says that he is of good size and that his hide is exceptionally good and hardier than near perfection as one would wish. He is guaranteed free from disease and also as a sure breeder. Price registered in either my name or the principal of the School f.o.s., Campbell River $125.00. Mr. Hurford states that the bull is worth easily twice the money but he has three which is too many for his stock but wishes to be allowed the right to purchase the animal back again at the same price at the end of three years. He states that he may not be obliged to do this but wishes to have the option if he wishes. My brother writes me that he was local examiner of the live stock at the Courtenay Fair and says that this is a very fine animal and that Mr. Hurford is a man absolutely to be relied on.\n\nIn summing up and taking all things into consideration I would recommend the purchase of the Jersey on account of the better grade of milk produced by Jerseys over Ayrshires or Holsteins. The bulls are inclined to be a little savage at times but that might said of a bull of any kind. The females at the school do not run very high in butter fat and I think that a Jersey bull would be the best means of improving the stock and getting a better grade of milk. Any of these animals are subject to prior sale so would you kindly advise me as soon as possible what to do and if in the meantime the Ayrshire bull which I went personally to see at Malcolm Island becomes available I will take this up before making the final purchase.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nW. H. Halliday\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 5, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 23 of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to clearing at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. I note that the tenders will be forwarded in due course.\n\nYou may purchase one horse for the use of the school when you consider such action timely. You should cooperate with the Rev. Principal in the selection of the animal and secure the advice of some competent person in the matter. No unnecessary expense should be incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay,\nB. C.\nOttawa, March 9, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 23 of the 28th ultimo, with further reference to clearing at the Alert Bay Indian Residential school.\n\nIn my earlier letter, you were authorized to purchase a breaking plough, a disc harrow and a drag saw. Would it not be possible to secure, in the case of the first two articles, equipment that would be suitable for either horses or the tractor, if supplied later. Additional authority is now granted for the purchase of a cultivator which is apparently needed, and an ordinary road scraper.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to the Principal as he, also, has written in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie.\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOttawa, March 1, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI regret that the Department cannot agree to the provision of a tractor at the present time (Alert Bay Indian Residential School). You may have the stump puller which you purchased some time ago, properly re-equipped; engage the services of two men and a horse for the stumping and an additional two men for the piling, if necessary. This work should be done by day labour. You may purchase a breaking plough, a disc harrow and a drag saw. The Department expects you to see that the machinery supplied is what is required for the purpose and that no unnecessary expense is incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nOttawa, February 1, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, with reference to live stock at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. When the Department replaces the main building at one of our institutions that has been in operation for some years, it is not the practice to provide complete new equipment and stock. It is expected that the existing herd, agricultural machinery, etc., will be used when the new building is occupied. However, when there is a material increase in pupilage because of a new building, the Department has allowed additional milk cows, and, when timely, favourable consideration will be given to supplementing your herd.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. Earl Anfield, Esq.,\nActing Principal,\nIndian Residential School,\nAlert Bay, B.

He chose this particular breed on account of the availability of animals in the Comox district and also on account of the fact that the Jersey is a reasonably small eater, which factor would be of great importance at Alert Bay where practically all feed and hay is shipped in.\n\nI estimate that we will require at least ten milking cows to handle the pupilage at the new school and it will also be necessary that accommodation should be provided for this herd. The inspector's report forwarded to you some time ago by our Dr. Westgate will give you information regarding the present barns and dairy equipment.\nIt will be necessary also to provide both stock and accommodation for hogs and chickens, both for meat and egg-laying purposes, as well as to provide instruction for the pupils in these subjects.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nEXTRACT FROM\nM.

Scott\nDeputy Sup't Gen. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nMr. Pidcock of Alert Bay has a small herd of dairy cows, all T.B. tested but has trouble getting a suitable bull. The Indian school there has a good one but it is said they are under some \"supervised herd\" scheme which forbids using the bull outside their own herd. If Mr. Pidcock's herd is really all T.B. tested it would seem quite safe to let him use the school bull.\n\nIt would of course be with the consent of the school principal but while Mr. Pidcock did not say so in so many words, I gathered from his letter that the objection did not come from the principal but from the \"supervised herd\" regulations. Subject to the principal's approval and to the cows being T.B. tested, could the regulations not be relaxed enough to let this man be encouraged in starting a dairy herd in this remote place?\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.W.

The most expensive item in the list is the Tractor, but our Commission trust you may be able to grant this, as it will be of immense service to the School Management, not only in connection with the farming activities which must of necessity be carried on, but in training the boy pupils to handle mechanical appliances of this sort which are so extensively used by their own people along the B.

The type requested is known as the \"Caterpillar\" 2 Ton Tractor, equipped with stationary drive pulley, as sold by the Morrison Tractor and Equipment Company, of Vancouver. Their price on this model is $1,705., f. o. b. Vancouver. I shall be glad to know if the business may be awarded to this firm. If not, please indicate a more suitable source of supply. The tractor is required at the present time, and I should be grateful if you would make immediate enquiries.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6429, file 875-14, part 1)\nDr. Westgate has urged the Department to provide a caterpillar tractor for the use of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. He represents that the machine could be used for hauling out logs, levelling around the building, clearing and for hauling supplies. Dr. Westgate believes that it would be advisable to sell the one team of horses that is owned by the school and to use the proposed tractor exclusively. I wrote to Commissioner Ditchburn for a recommendation, and he replies that he is perfectly in accord with the suggestion. It is difficult to keep stock because of lack of feed at Alert Bay, and he recommends that a tractor be supplied. The cost of the model recommended would be $1,705., f. o. b. Vancouver. I should be pleased to have your instructions.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in which you state that Dr. Westgate, of the Missionary Society of Canada, urges the Department to provide a caterpillar tractor for the use of the Alert Bay Indian School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this subject was discussed between Principal Anfield and myself, when I visited Alert Bay on the 17th of July, and as a result of our conference on this subject, I am perfectly in accord with the suggestion. This is in view of the fact that the area on which feed can be grown for stock on the Alert Bay Industrial School Reserve is very limited, and what can be grown will be needed for the cattle. Even at that it is estimated that a certain amount of hay will have to be purchased from the Fraser Valley during certain seasons of the year. The tractor can do everything that a team of horses would be needed for, and it would cost less for gasoline for the tractor than for hay for the horses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

These logs are so large that horses could not handle them, and it will be practically impossible to cut them up into wood where they lie.\n(2) To complete the clearing of the land already under cultivation.\n(3) To help in the levelling up of the ground, a work which will involve an immense amount of grading.\n(4) The hauling of supplies, etc., which will be used in the new building.\n\nThe need of this tractor appears to me to be fully as great and even greater than the need which existed at our Sioux Lookout School, and I am quite convinced that at neither institution would it be possible to bring such heavily timbered land into a satisfactory state of cultivation without it. At the same time I am also very strongly of the opinion that the items of work mentioned under sections (1), (2), and (3) should not be left entirely to the school management, but should be undertaken by your Department and without expense to our Society. The \"Caterpillar\" tractor recommended by Mr. Anfield would be of incalculable service in this connection, and might be used by the men engaged by your Department to do this work, and then handed over to the School as part of their equipment.\nA still further reason why a tractor should be supplied to this institution is to be found in the necessity which exists for giving the Indian boys a working knowledge of an instrument of this kind. Comparatively little use will ever be made of horses along the B.C. coast and instruction in the handling of instruments of this kind should be a great help to the Indian boys in earning a livelihood after they have left the School.\n\nMr. Anfield took this matter up with Mr. Indian Commissioner Ditchburn during his recent visit to Alert Bay, and he states that the Commissioner was firmly of the opinion that a tractor should be secured, and the horses disposed of by sale.\n\nHe also secured information about tractors from the Morrison Tractor and Equipment Co., Ltd., Vancouver, and I enclose herewith the original of their letter addressed to him on March 27th last, and with it an illustration of the two ton \"Caterpillar\" tractor, equipped with Stationary Drive Pulley which he recommends should be supplied.\n\nI commend this important matter to your prompt and sympathetic consideration, and have the honour to remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOffice of the Kwawkewlth Indian Agency,\n\nJuly 4, 1929\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. 80, amounting to $102.10 in favour of Massey-Harris Company, Ltd., Vancouver, B.C., for Mower for School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 156/0/14 dated June 12, 1929.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101.\nWm.

Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn has recommended that this equipment be furnished for the above purpose.

I may state that the shipping weight will be approximately 5400 lbs. and the freight approximately $60. to Alert Bay. You should arrange to have the tractor delivered at Alert Bay at an early date, requesting the above company to prepay the freight charges. Please obtain an account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the tractor, together with receipt for freight charges prepaid. When the tractor has been delivered, given a test and found satisfactory, you should attach the account to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send to the Department with freight receipt attached. For your information, I am enclosing the quotation received by the Principal for the supplying of the above equipment, also an illustration of same. When forwarding the account covering the cost, please return the enclosed quotation.\n\nThe Department is informing the church authorities and Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn that the matter of placing the order and arranging for the delivery of the tractor at Alert Bay has been placed in your hands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Vancouver wharf, for $165.00. It is strong and serviceable, and is necessary to properly carry out the work at the school.\n\nAt the present time, the school has two horses, but we are endeavoring to find purchasers for them, and when this is done, they would have no means of doing any ploughing, unless a plough suitable for the tractor has been purchased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M.

I am in correspondence with Mr. Indian Agent Halliday in this connection. On the 11th instant, the Department authorized the purchase of two milch cows. Before any further stock is purchased, however, it will be necessary to be sure that there is adequate accommodation and sufficient food available.\n\nI regret that there are no funds at the present time for the purchase of a motor truck or a motor boat.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDecember 26th, 1929.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nOn File No. 56-145 Dr. Westgate has written on the 13th instant, making various requests for the Alert Bay Indian Residential School. Among these are the following:\n\n1. Milch cows (Red Poles desired.)\n2. Hogs.\n3. Poultry.\n4. A motor truck for hauling supplies and a motor boat.\nOttawa, December 11th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, regarding the shortage of milk at the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, and recommending that two milch cows be supplied.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange with the Dominion Government Veterinarian for the purchase of two good grade milch cows. The cows should be of a good type, free from tuberculosis and of a breed considered satisfactory by the Principal and yourself as good milk producing stock. The price to be paid should be as reasonable as possible, having in view the obtaining of satisfactory cows in all respects. The Department will pay the cost of supplying these two cows, together with any expenses for transportation, etc., upon receipt of properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure. The purchase and delivery of these cattle should receive your early attention, and you should take this matter up with the Dominion Government Veterinarian and obtain his assistance in making the purchase at an early date.\n\nBefore the Department can decide as to the supplying of a further number of milch cows, I shall be pleased to have full information as to the accommodation provided and also whether the school authorities can supply the necessary feed requirements.\n\nRegarding the horses and the purchasing of a cultivator, the Department will await a definite decision as to the disposal of the horses and the type of cultivator or other farm machinery required, together with full information as to the cost involved in the supplying of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nNovember 30, 1929.\n\n176/23\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise you that Dr. Westgate of the Missionary Society of the Church of Canada has been visiting at Alert Bay, and with him I have gone carefully over the source of supplies, etc., for St. Michael's Residential School. The school has, as you are aware, almost doubled in the number of pupils who are attending, and this will be augmented by another thirty or forty. There is a great shortage of milk at the school, and up to the present time there has been a shortage of pasture. The shortage of pasture will continue, I may say, for another year, until the new clearing gets into a condition to produce, but in the meantime the shortage of milk is acute.\n\nI understand that Dr. Frank, the Dominion Government Veterinarian, has recommended Red-polled cattle, and if communication was got through him, I would recommend that two milk cows be obtained by the Department to get the school well started. I don't know what the price would be, but that could be obtained from him.\n\nRegarding the horses which they have, I understand from Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn that the idea of getting the tractor was to do away with the horses, as pasture is very limited and feed very dear, but at the present time no purchaser has been available. I will be using one horse for some little time in the land clearing operations which I am carrying on for the benefit of this school, but this will be completed, weather permitting, by about the first of March, and I think that steps should be taken to sell these horses. If they do, it will be necessary to purchase some kind of a cultivator that will work by power. I believe there is one on the market the cost of which is about $160.00, run by a two-horse motor, and which is equipped and sent out from Vancouver by Easthope Bros.. I recommend these things to your serious consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWMH/SMT\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, Canada.\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nOttawa, November 30, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School requesting authority to purchase three (3) scoop shovels from the contractor who erected the new school building, and stating the price at which they can be obtained.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will approve of the purchase of the three scoop shovels referred to at a cost of $10 each. You may inform Mr. Agent Halliday and request him to forward a certified voucher, in duplicate, in the usual manner covering the cost.\n\nRelative to the request that the Department purchase a truck which was also left by the contractor, I have to say that the Department has no funds to purchase same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., November 23, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEarly in the month I received the enclosed letter from Mr. Anfield, Principal of the Alert Bay School, referring to the desirability of purchasing three scoop shovels left by Mr. Carson, contractor, which he is willing to dispose of for $10.00 each; also the suggestion that the Department should purchase a truck which Mr. Carson left for which he asks $200.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that I am of the opinion that the three scoop shovels would be very useful in levelling off ground at the School and it would be desirable to purchase them at the price mentioned.\n\nAs regards the purchasing of Mr. Carson's truck, I am fully of the opinion that this purchase would be in the interest of the School, as the old Ford truck is now in a very dilapidated condition.\n\nI, therefore, would recommend that these purchases be made and vouchers for the same be sent in by Mr. Indian Agent Halliday.\n\nEnclosure:-\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

They are in first-class shape, and I hold the invoice for them showing that they cost $24.00 apiece. Mr. Carson offers them to the school for $10.00 each. As we have a tractor, and the use of some such implements will be imperative this winter, will you kindly consider the purchase of them.\n\nMr. Carson has also left his truck here, and hopes that we will be able to purchase same. He asks two hundred dollars for it. Whilst you were here, you must have been aware that our present truck cannot last much longer, and as Mr. Carson's truck is now being overhauled and put in first-class shape, we were wondering if the Department would be willing to purchase it for the use of the schools. I have taken this matter up with our Commission, and they have advised me to write to you in this connection.\n\nI did not bring these matters to your attention whilst you were here, as I felt that you were already overburdened with other requests, but we would appreciate anything you may be able to do in this regard.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reply I regret to state that there are no funds for the purpose.\n\nThe other questions raised in your communication are receiving attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nI also beg to direct your attention to the urgent need of a motor truck. As the school has no private wharf and all supplies, coal, etc., have to be transported from the cannery wharf about \u00bc of a mile distant, the need of this item of equipment is obvious. When the main school building was under construction your Department kindly provided a grant of $200.00 to buy a second hand truck. This truck rendered sufficient service to justify its purchase. When it became useless another used truck was purchased by the Principal, but this is now practically worn out, and must soon be replaced. At one time the Principal felt that a boat would be necessary, but if the road to the cannery wharf is completed, or the saw-mill wharf is repaired and made available for the school's use, the cost of the boat may be saved. A good Ford truck can be delivered at Alert Bay for $900.00 and I beg to strongly recommend that this expenditure be authorized at the earliest date possible.\nOttawa, October 14, 1930.\n\nFORD MOTORS,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nPurchase Ford truck for Alert Bay Indian Residential school has been authorized by this Department -STOP- Please allow usual terms to government on price.\n\nA.

This was supplementary to the work that had been done during the last fiscal year.\n\nI am enclosing a statement in duplicate showing receipts and expenditures and also my cheque for $36.30 being the unexpended balance.\n\nIn connection with the receipts, it will be noted that there is an amount of $44.70 in favor of Marshall-Wells for equipment. In explanation of this, I may say that all the stumps from the piece of land which I was having cleared had been pulled with our big stumping machine, but this machine was altogether too slow and heavy to be used for piling the stuff, and it was intended to use the school tractor to gather the stuff up, and it was necessary in order to pile it to purchase a light wire and two blocks. I made an arrangement with Mr. Anfield by which the school agreed to do this piling for the consideration that this equipment would be turned over to them, and as the labor would have amounted to considerably more than the equipment, I considered the bargain a good one on both sides.\n\nAll these accounts are respectfully submitted for your favorable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M.

The intention of the School is only to keep enough cows to supply the school while it is in session, but as during the holidays a large number of the pupils would be away, it would leave them with an overplus.\n\nI do not happen to have any catalogue of prices, and it is some considerable time since I personally had anything to do with these machines, but I submit it to the Department for their consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nApril 24, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Indian Residential School asking that the Department give a further grant towards getting two Guernsey cows for that institution.\n\nI may say that the Principal has just completed the purchase of four new cows from Kingcome Inlet, but Inspector Barry during his recent visit to Alert Bay considered that even these would not provide sufficient milk for the needs of the School. I understand that you will hear from the Inspector himself on this matter.\n\nRegarding the bull, the one that they have I am sorry to say, was badly neglected after it was first bought, and does not show itself to be as well bred an animal as the pedigree shows, but they have had it now for six years and it is time they had a change, and I would recommend that authority be given me to dispose of the present one and purchase a new one for the use of the School. They would prefer, however, a Guernsey this time instead of a Jersey.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, May 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, relative to the request of the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School to be supplied with two Guernsey cows and to dispose of the bull and purchase a new one.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is expected that all replacements of stock will be made by the school management from per capita earnings or other receipts. Further, it is expected that the herd strength will be kept up to a standard to supply sufficient milk for the use of the school. As milk is an important item in the diet of the pupils, provision should be made for an ample supply.\n\nI have also your letter of the same date regarding the request of the Principal to be supplied with a separator. As our funds this year are extremely limited, the school authorities will have to provide this equipment from per capita earnings or other receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. H. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF SCHOOL INSPECTOR BARRY, DATED APRIL 13 & 14, 1931, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE ALERT BAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL. - Original on File 156-0-6.\n\nLive Stock:\n\nThere are 2 horses, 2 fairly good Guernsey cows (6 and 5 years). The remainder of the cows are in my opinion scrubs and quite useless. They are 3 Holstein cows (8, 8 and 6 years old), 3 poor grade cows not milking. There is a Guernsey calf (4 months). The school has a Jersey bull, 5 years old. This bull ought to be exchanged. Two cows have died suddenly in the last three months. There are 30 old hens and 3 ducks.\n\nWhen I was at the school only four cows were milking. This gave about 16 gallons per day, which was not enough to supply the kitchen. Milk by the case is bought from Vancouver as required. The children, except in the few cases mentioned above, were not having any milk to drink.\n\nI explained to the Principal that I did not like this state of things, as the children of the coast were, as he knew, subject to T.B. The result of this little talk was that the Principal immediately went to Kingcome Inlet and bought four new cows. This will increase the milk yield by 10 gallons per day, and will allow for a cup of milk daily for Junior and Intermediate children.\nOttawa, July 4, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, relative to the request of the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School to be supplied with a cream separator.\n\nIn this connection I have to say it is considered that the milk supplied for the pupils' use at this school is really not adequate, and the Department believes that all the milk obtained should be served whole to the children. I would point out that milk is a most important item of the children's diet and they should be given an adequate supply. The Department does not consider it necessary at the present time to supply a separator.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. W. Halliday, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\nSir:\n\nThe Principal of the School has again written me on the matter of the purchase of a cream separator which was refused by the Department in a previous communication.\n\nHe states that the Commission wish attention to be drawn to the fact that they have, from the per capita grant, purchased four cows recently for the School, and are meeting all the expense in the necessary alterations and repairs to the present building and the old Girls' Home during the present summer months, and they stress the fact that they cannot afford to purchase the separator from the per capita funds.\n\nI leave this matter for the consideration of the Department, but I wish to draw attention to the fact that when the School is in session and all the children are present, there is not very much chance to separate very much milk, as it would all be used, and the separator would be used principally during the vacation times as the cows are milking then and without a separator, it is difficult to do much with it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M.

For an Eversman Junior Automatic Leveller, weight 950 pounds, the price F.O.B. at Alert Bay would be $255.00. This machine is very highly recommended, and as the school is in need of considerable assistance in preparing a proper playground for the children, I would recommend that the Department make this purchase.\n\nIt can be obtained from the Morrison Tractor & Equipment Company, 940 Station Street, Vancouver, and as we have had dealings with this firm I know that they are absolutely reliable.\n\nThere is considerable work being done all the time in grading and levelling the grounds, but without a proper leveller it entails a great deal of unnecessary labor, and it is the aim of the Principal to make the school grounds a beauty spot, not only for the benefit of the children but also as a sign that the Indian Department is wide-awake to their opportunities as guardians of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, September 30, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, relative to the request of the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School that the Department supply the school with a leveller, and stating the price at which same can be obtained.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department has no funds to provide for the cost of supplying this equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

The Principal adds that they are not asking for an expensive machine, as he is given to understand there are machines on the market which would answer their needs priced as low as from forty to fifty dollars.\n\nI am aware that the Department is very short of funds, but if the funds are available I would recommend this purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(W.M. Halliday)\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa, February 29, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, regarding a communication which you received from the Principal of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School, renewing his request to be supplied with a cream separator for use during the summer months.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, in view of the recent orders for strict economy, the Department regrets it will be unable to authorize the expenditure required in the purchase of this equipment. As stated in previous correspondence, the school authorities will have to provide the separator from per capita earnings or other receipts.

Westgate, D.D., Field Secretary of the M.S.C.C., regarding Inspector Barry's report on his inspection of the ALERT BAY INDIAN RES. SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 156-0-6.\n\nIn connection with the live stock, Inspector Barry states that at least six Guernsey R.O.P. cows and a bull be obtained before next September. He further states that the majority of the present cows should be cleared off the farm before the new ones arrive. The Department feels that you recognize the importance of an adequate milk supply at all residential schools and it is, therefore, hoped that your Society will make the necessary arrangements for the purchase of the cows suggested by our inspector. For your information, I quote the following from Mr. Barry's report: \"I do not believe that the cows are being properly fed. They are certainly not being properly bedded, as only a small quantity of leaves is used in place of the required straw\".\nCLOSED\n\nFROM 30/5/21\n\nTO 28/3/32\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6429)\n\nFile 875-5, part 11\nKwawkewlth Agency - Alert Bay Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies Accounts. 1948 - 1949\n\nFile 875-5, part 12\nKwawkewlth Agency - Alert Bay Residential School - Building Maintenance - Accounts. 1949\n\nFile 875-5, part 13\nKwawkewlth Agency - Alert Bay Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1949 - 1950\n\nFile 875-8, part 1\nKwawkewlth Agency - Alert Bay Residential School - Principal's Residence. 1949\n\nFile 875-9, part 3\nKwawkewlth Agency - Alert Bay Residential School - School Land. 1932 - 1948\n\nFile 875-11, part 3\nKwawkewlth Agency - Alert Bay Residential School - Vocational Training - Supplies - Accounts. 1940 - 1948\n\nFile 875-11, part 4\nKwawkewlth Agency - Alert Bay Residential School - Vocational Training - Supplies - Accounts. 1948 - 1950\n\nFile 875-14, part 1\nKwawkewlth Agency - Alert Bay Residential School - Livestock - Supplies - Accounts. 1921 - 1932\n\nFile 875-14, part 2\nKwawkewlth Agency - Alert Bay Residential School - Livestock - Supplies - Accounts. 1938 - 1947\n\nFile 875-22, part 1\nKwawkewlth Agency - Alert Bay Residential School - Tuition Payments. 1936 - 1944\n\nFile 875-23, part 1\nKwawkewlth Agency - Alert Bay Residential School - Death of Pupils. 1948\n15th June, 1938\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd:\n\nWill you please lay before the Department the need of another bull for the School farm.\n\nThe present animal has been in use for over six years, and we are having considerable trouble with our breeding. A new animal should be provided for this fall for sure, and should not be less than a year old. We would like to continue with a pure bred Guernsey, and would suggest that the Inspector of the Health of Animals Branch, Federal Block, Vancouver, be asked to make the purchase as the animal would have to be tested for T.B. by them before shipment in any case.\n\nIt is important that an animal from a good milk strain be secured. The farm manager is of the opinion that the present animal is not worth transferring to another school.\n\nThanking you for your interest in this matter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\"F.E. Anfield\"\nPrincipal.\n\nFEA/L\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJune 24th, 1938\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe enclosed letter received from Mr. F.E. Anfield, Principal of the Alert Bay Residential School in connection with the purchase of another bull for the school farm will be self-explanatory.\n\nAs we have no connection with anyone who could supply this, it is felt if the matter was referred to Mr. Caldwell, Agricultural Agent, he might be able to assist in the purchase.\n\nWould you kindly advise us your wishes in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"M.S. Todd\"\nIndian Agent.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of St. Michael's Residential School has drawn attention to the need of a new bull for the School farm at Alert Bay.\n\nAn item of $100.00 was included in the 1938-39 estimates submitted by Mr. Indian Agent Todd for this purpose. It will be recalled however, that Mr. Todd's estimates were late in reaching the Department, and it is just possible that provision was not made for this expenditure.\n\nInquiries have been made as to the Guernsey stock available in the Fraser Valley, and as a result of replies received, Mr. Indian Agricultural Agent Caldwell visited two farms to look over the animals for sale. There are only two Guernsey bulls available at present, and of these the eleven months old bull at Mr. Ross Peers' farm, Sardis, B.C. is considered the most suitable, and should funds be available I would recommend the purchase of this animal.

This animal died a few weeks ago from an undetermined cause.\n\nAlthough this office recommended the purchase of the Guernsey bull supplied in 1938, I was not aware at the time that it was not the policy to extend such assistance to Indian Residential School farms. In this particular case, the stock is raised at Alert Bay to provide milk, beef and milk products for the children and staff. Instruction in stock raising and agricultural pursuits is not given to any extent at the School, as the Indian children are mostly from Reserves where the Indians are engaged in the fishing and lumbering industries.\n\nUnless it is the established policy of the Department to assist in the maintenance of cattle at Residential Schools where stock is raised to provide food for the School, it is considered the school should be required to provide a suitable animal from school funds.\n\nThe cost of a well-bred Holstein bull calf would be approximately $150.00.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.

Three of these pupils, Flora Eleanor Hamner, #336, age 16 years; Beatrice Rose Edwards, #271, age 15 years; and Charlie Jefferson Brown, #400, age 16 years, have applied to continue their studies in Grade IX.

The two girls both wish to train as nurses eventually and Charlie will be taking charge of a large general store when he gets older.\n\nIn conversation with Inspector Barry and also with the Provincial Inspector, Mr. J.Z. Manning, I suggested the advisability of allowing these pupils to attend the Alert Bay Superior School, in order to give them contact with white children in their Grade IX course. I am convinced that if Indian children taking advanced courses are to succeed, they must take these courses in the environment of white schools. In this both Inspectors heartily agreed; Inspector Manning being quite agreeable to the pupils attending the local Superior School, and Inspector Barry stating that he was prepared to endorse a recommendation that the Dept. make a grant to meet the necessary fees. I am now in receipt of a letter from the local School Board approving the admission of these three pupils on a fee paying basis!

I wish to say that these have been very fine pupils and have been a welcome addition to my classes. I consider that they have spent a very profitable year. Their attitude to the work has at all times been excellent, better than that of the average of the regular pupils of this school. The quality of their work has been at least equal to that of the average regular pupils. Their unfailing courtesy and good manners reflect the training they have received at your school, and I count it a pleasure to have had to work with them.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd) N. B.

(RG 10, Volume 6429, file 875-22, part 1)\nI, Beatrice Rose Edwards, pupil of St. Michael's Residential School, Alert Bay, make oath and say:\n\n\"My father and mother are both dead. My mother's sister married a man by the name of Albert Edwards, and when my mother died I lived with my father for a little while and then my auntie and her husband took me. Then I came to school, and have been in school ever since, but went home for holidays last summer.\n\nAlbert Edwards is a lighthouse keeper at Massett. The lighthouse is quite a distance from where they live, and as he has not been very well my auntie told me to go with him to the lighthouse to see that he would be alright. When we were going to and from the lighthouse he tried all the time to make love to me, but I didn't like it and he didn't do anything more. I used to try to get someone else to go with me because I didn't like to be alone with him. He never liked me to play with other boys and girls all summer, and I didn't have a happy time on my holiday because I was always a little bit afraid of him.\n\nI don't want to go back to Massett this summer because I feel that he will want me to do things which I do not want to do and I am afraid of him.\"\n\nI state that the above statement is true and of the same force and effect as though taken under the Canada Evidence Act.\n\nAlert Bay, B.C.,\nJuly 7th, 1941.\n\nWitness\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6429, file 875-22, part 1)\nDear Sir,\n\nOn July 7th last Principal Anfield of St. Michael's School came to me accompanied by Beatrice Rose Edwards, pupil of the school, and asked for the Department's assistance in respect to the future of this girl. After Mr. Anfield had discussed the whole matter privately with me, I then discussed her problem with the girl herself, and in view of the disclosures made to me I took the attached statement from her and am forwarding it to you seeking your advice.\n\nFor your information, this pupil has now passed her Grade X in the Superior Public School at Alert Bay, the Department having paid her tuition fees during the past two years, and she has been living at the Residential School. This year we had a very excellent report from the school on her work and conduct, and it is her ambition to continue her studies and eventually train for the nursing profession. The Principal of the Superior School reports on her as follows: \"Her English is fair to good; in all other subjects she is good. She has the intelligence to carry her along to University entrance.\" I therefore feel the Department should give every assistance to this child in her efforts to make something out of herself.\n\nYou will please note that both her father and mother are dead, and that she lived with an aunt for a short time before being put into the Residential School at an early age, and she has been in the school ever since. The Principal informs me the living conditions in her aunt's home where she has been going for holiday periods are not of the best, and it was for this reason that Beatrice did not wish to return there this year, and was permitted to remain in the school.\n\nBeatrice informs me that she has had a letter from Albert Edwards, stating that unless she comes home immediately he will come to Alert Bay and forcibly take her out of the school, and as the Statement discloses that the girl is afraid of this man, who is not a blood relation, I feel the Department should definitely appoint someone as her legal guardian until she is twenty-one years of age, so that she will not have to return to Massett and her aunt and husband and will be nothing further to do with her. At present of course Mr. Anfield is representing the Department as her legal guardian. Beatrice informs me Mr. Gillatt baptized her about 1925 when he was Indian Agent at Massett, and that in all probability he would know whether Albert Edwards and her aunt ever took out legal adoption papers for her. This case is a pathetic one and I feel requires the sympathetic attention of the Department.\n\nThe reason I am taking this up direct with you rather than with her own Indian Agent, Mr. Phillips, is to get quick action in view of the fact that this man Albert Edwards stated he was coming to Alert Bay and forcibly take out of the school if she did not return home.\nreturn home, and the mail service between Alert Bay and Massett is very slow and intermittent. If you could give us instructions that this girl must remain in the School under Principal Anfield's guardianship until her future is definitely decided, it would be appreciated very much.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(M.S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nVancouver, B.C.\n15/6/3005\n\nOttawa, July 14, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to Beatrice Rose Edwards.\n\nIn view of the information contained in the letter from Indian Agent Todd, it has been decided to allow this girl to remain in the Alert Bay School for another year.\n\nOur records indicate that this girl is now 17 years of age, and it will not be possible to consider keeping her in the Alert Bay School as a grant-earning pupil for an indefinite period. It is noted that her home conditions are not suitable. I think you will agree that the time will come when we must discharge her from the residential school as far as paying grant for her is concerned. However, as stated above, she may remain for the academic year 1941-42, but her case should be reviewed again early in June, 1942.\n\nI doubt the advisability of spending funds in allowing this girl to proceed further with higher education. Our experience shows that even when Indian girls obtain considerably higher standing than this girl has, it is extremely difficult for them to find employment except in our own work, and at times even this is very difficult.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding herewith a letter dated July 9th received from Mr. Indian Agent Todd, Kwawkewlth Agency, with reference to Beatrice Rose Edwards, a pupil of the St. Michael's Indian Residential School.\n\nA copy of my letter of July 11th addressed to Mr. Todd is attached for your information.\n\nI would refer you to Departmental letter 156-0-22 of August 19, 1940, in which a grant was allowed at the rate of $50.00 each for three pupils of the St. Michael's school, Beatrice Edwards being one, who would remain on the roll of that school but attend the Alert Bay Provincial School for academic instruction in high school grades.\n\nThe case of Beatrice Edwards has been discussed in detail with Inspector Harry and both he and I are of the opinion that this girl should not be permitted to return at present to Massett. I would recommend, therefore, that the Department permit her to remain a per capita drawing pupil of the St. Michael's Residential School for the next academic year, whether or not it may later be possible to authorize the high school fees for her continued education at the Alert Bay Provincial School.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Paragraph 3 of the above circular reads as follows:\n\n\"Orphans and children of destitute parents should not be allowed summer holidays unless arrangements can be made for their care when away from the school. This provision has special application to girls from twelve to sixteen years of age. Extreme care should be exercised in the case of pupils whose homes are distant from the school. Unless special safeguards concerning their return can be taken, holidays should not be granted.\"\n\nAs both parents of Beatrice Edwards are dead and as it appears from your report that Mr. Anfield considers conditions in the home to which she has usually gone for holidays unsatisfactory, the Department's instructions as quoted above must be considered to cover this case.\n\nI do not consider that Albert Edwards has any right to the custody of the girl in question and you should instruct Mr. Anfield not to permit the return of the girl to Massett but, on the contrary, to arrange for her safe accommodation with the other children remaining at St. Michael's during the vacation, until the wishes of the Department can be ascertained.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nM.S.Todd, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nD.M.Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO**: Mr. A.

His father is an ex-pupil of the Residential School here and one of the best and most reliable Chiefs we have in the Agency. This lad is bright with a good background, and any money the Department spend on his education will I think, be returned many times over.\n\nI strongly recommend his application be given first consideration, and if funds are available sympathetic consideration be given the others.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n(M. S. Todd)\nIndian Agent\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nMr. F. EARL ANFIELD, S.M.\nPrincipal\n\nST. MICHAEL'S SCHOOL\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nAugust 12, 1941.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Todd,\n\nThe following pupils who were promoted to Grade Nine are anxious to continue their studies at High School:\n\nPupil #301, Joyce Wilson, Metlakatla, age 15 years, 10 months.\nPupil #311, Alfred Scow, Kwicksutaincuk, age 14 years, 6 months.\nPupil #552, Edwin Newman, Bella Bella, age 15 years, 6 months.\n\nAs the Commission are utterly unable to appoint a High School teacher at St. Michael's this year, it would be necessary that these children take their High School work at the Alert Bay Superior School and I am wishing to ascertain the wishes of yourself and the Department regarding same. The fees are $5.00 per month per pupil and the sum of $150.00 will be necessary to put these three pupils through the year, in addition to their per capita grants. Joyce Wilson is most anxious to be a teacher and she has a natural gift for such work. She has no father and anything invested in her now will, I am reasonably sure, be productive of good for her future. Alfred Scow is the son of William D. Scow and you are, I am sure, fully aware of the worthwhileness of continuing this boy's education. Edwin Newman is an exceptionally bright lad who would respond to an opportunity for advancement.\n\nI have been requested by the Commission to apply to you for your favourable consideration and recommendation of a special grant from the B.C. Special vote of $150.00 for these pupils. I endorse the application wholeheartedly.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nMr. F. EARL ANFIELD, S.M.\nPrincipal\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nAlert Bay, B.C.\n\nAugust 12, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Todd,\n\nAcknowledging copies of letters from the Indian Commissioner for B.C. nos. 15-6-3003 and 3157 of July 11th and 22nd respectively re Beatrice Rose Edwards, pupil # 271 of this School, it is noted that the Department sanctions the return of this pupil to the School for another year on a grant earning basis.\n\nThis girl is now ready to proceed to Grade Eleven and your consideration is requested for a grant of $50.00 (10 months @ $5.00 per month) to allow her to continue her studies at the Alert Bay Superior School, whilst in residence at St. Michael's.\n\nOur Commission have found it impossible to secure the services of a High School teacher for St. Michael's this coming term, and unless Beatrice can continue her studies, for which she has shown exceptional aptitude, it would seem useless to keep her here. At the same time, it would be extremely dangerous for her to be sent home. This girl wishes to continue her studies with a view to becoming a nurse and the School Commission will, I am sure, be able to place her successfully when she graduates in one or other of our Schools. Under the circumstances, I would strongly recommend that she be permitted and helped by a grant to proceed towards Matriculation.\n\nThanking you,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFEA/K.\nPrincipal.\n\nAlert Bay, 15th. 1941\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHaving full knowledge of the circumstances effecting this Pupil I strongly recommend the above request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\n(M.

Under no consideration will grants for this girl be allowed beyond this academic year.\n\nThe Department also approves a grant of $50.00 for the education of Alfred Scow, No. 611, in order that he may attend high school.\n\nI would like to bring to your attention that under existing regulations no moneys from the B.C.

MICHAEL'S Indian Residential School at ALERT BAY, B.C., \nwho died at ST. GEORGE'S HOSPITAL, ALERT BAY, on MAY 20, 1948.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nWhen a pupil of an Indian Residential School dies, the Principal is required to inform the Indian Agent at once.\n\nOn receipt of the Principal's notice the Indian Agent shall convene a Board of Inquiry, consisting of himself as Chairman, the Principal of the Residential School, and the Medical Officer who attended the deceased pupil. These members of the Board shall, in each other's presence, complete this memorandum, which shall then be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, in one copy.\n\nThe Board of Inquiry shall, if at all practicable assemble within 48 hours of the pupil's death.\n\nThe parents or guardians of the deceased pupil shall be given notice of this inquiry and be permitted to attend it or to send a representative. They or their representative shall be asked if they wish to make a statement. In the event of their so wishing, their statement shall be attached to the report. The inquiry, however, shall not be delayed more than 72 hours after the time at which it would otherwise be held, to enable them to attend it.\n\nIf the Indian Agent is located at such a distance from the school as to make it impracticable for him to attend the Board, he shall request a responsible local resident to act for him. A suitable person for this duty would be a Justice of the Peace or a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted or Provincial Police. A more or less permanent arrangement of this kind might be necessary in some cases. The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this duty, on the Agent's recommendation. The report of the Board, in any case, must reach the Department through the Indian Agent's office.\n\nThis inquiry is not designed to take the place of, or prevent, any other inquiry, including an inquest, which may be required by law.\n\nIf the pupil died as the result of an accident, the Indian Agent is required to take the statements of the witnesses of the accident, and attach them to this memorandum.\n\nFORM No. 414.\nA. STATEMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OF THE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n1. On what date did this pupil fall sick or suffer injury? May 18.\n\n2. At what time of day? 7:30 p.m.\n\n3. When and to whom did he or she report this illness or accident? Rosies' playmates immediately ran to the school to report to me.\n\n4. What means were taken to afford relief? Reggie was carried to the school on a stretcher to await arrival of the doctor.\n\n5. What medicines were used for this purpose and in what dose or quantity? None.\n\n6. When was the doctor called? 7:35 p.m.\n\n7. If the pupil was removed to hospital, at what time was this done and by what means of transport? 7:40 p.m., in the taxi which brought the doctor.\n\n8. If the pupil was not removed to hospital, what measures were taken for his or her care at the school?\n\n9. Add any other useful information here.\n\nThe boys decided to cut off branches beyond the treeline, and found a safe place among the trees overlooking the old logging road. Two of the boys made a successful jump but Reggie lost his nerve when at the full height of the pole-barn and he fell about fifty feet.\n\nPrincipal.\n\nNote: If the deceased pupil dies in hospital at a distance from the school, under the care of the physician or surgeon who attends him at the hospital, a clinical report of the patient's illness and death in the hospital is to be secured and attached to this memorandum.\nB. STATEMENT OF THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED THE DECEASED PUPIL\n\nI attended Reggie Allan from May 18/48 to May 20/48. The immediate cause of death was fracture skull.\n\nThe contributory cause of death was:\n\nDo you consider that the Principal of the School, and the members of the School staff exercised reasonable care and judgment in regard to the illness and death of this pupil? Yes\n\nDid they follow out your professional instructions? Yes\n\nIf in either respect, you consider them to have been at fault, it is required that you express your carefully considered views as follows:\n\n[Signature]\nM.D.\nC. STATEMENT OF INDIAN AGENT\n\n1. Having heard and read over the statements of the Principal and the Physician, do you consider that all essential circumstances relating to the death of Reggie Allan have been recorded? Yes. If not, you are required to add here any further particulars which strike you as essential.\n\n2. In this space record any recommendations which the Board consider should be made to the Department in relation to the health or safety of the pupils of this School.\n\n(1) Remove all means of amusement within school property which are dangerous.\n\n(2) The Department to insist that all children enrolled in this school be properly supervised at all times.\n\nSupervision in this school is lacking and has been for the past four years or more. Children are allowed to roam around at will when they are out of the classrooms. The staff are not aware of where they are or what they are doing. I have complained about this before but no improvement is noticeable.\n\nThe school lacks organization of the right type and this must originate with the principal.\n\nI do not think we will ever have proper supervision until adequate, efficient staff of the right type is employed. This means paying proper remuneration to employees, something which is not done at the present time.\n\nChairman\u2014Indian Agent.\n| Central Registry | P.A.
