Mr. Jacobs is acting under power of attorney for the owner of the building. Mr. MacKenzie also authorized Mr. Daillebout to furnish six tons of coal; the accounts for this work and material will be forwarded through your office.\n\nBefore the Sisters take charge of the boys' school after the Christmas holidays, you will be good enough to arrange to have the teachers' desks and chairs varnished, and also to have the pupils' desks on the second storey repaired where necessary.\n\nAn arrangement was also entered into whereby Mr. Jacobs is to receive 25\u00a2 a trip for driving the Sisters to and from the boys' school in inclement\n\nJ.

Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr. Ethier,\n\nNot knowing whom to address in the Department, I send you this information; perhaps you could do something.\n\nPeter Delisle is beginning his business again! Yesterday, at the close of high mass, he made an incendiary speech and announced a great meeting that is to take place this evening, Monday, to consider means that could be taken to expel Mr. Popart and to prevent the building of the convent. Philis real disorder! How is it that this man is allowed thus to raise an agitation, to trouble the village, to harangue against the decisions of the Department, against established order, against this and against that? With ignorant and credulous people such as ours...\na fanatic such as he can turn anything upside down. Could not the Department strictly prohibit these meetings called solely to create disorder and unwholesome agitation? I know well that he will not succeed in doing what he desires, but that does not alter the fact that he is doing much evil, and say that he ought to be arrested.\n\nSome twenty-five years ago, in somewhat similar circumstances, the Department strictly forbade these disorderly meetings. This was done for the great good of all.\n\nI do not dare to complain too much to the Department, because there reason to believe that there are traitors close by who communicate to Peter Delisle all the information that I can send. In some cases he seems to have been informed.\nCertain things before even the Agent.\n\nI hope that the papers for the exchange of land have reached Ottawa. The absence of the archbishop delayed the sending of them.\n\nBest regards to yourself and Mrs. Ch\u00eane.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

During this month I have not been able to visit the Bush school on account of an excess of work at my office. I may remark to the Department that the furnace in the boys' school is not giving satisfaction; the upper story is not sufficiently heated. I have carefully examined the said furnace, and I have not been able to find out what is defective. When the severe cold comes, this furnace does not send out heat to all the apartments. I ask for authority to get a man of experience to come and put things right.\n\nYours, &c.,\nJ.M. Brosseau,\nAgent.\nCaughnawaga, Mai 8, 1917.\n\nDear SIR:\n\nI would wish to obtain your interpretation of the law obliging children to attend school till their fifteenth year. Several of our boys of the fifth and sixth forms only fourteen years old work in Dominion Bridge.\n\nOn applying to the Indian Agent to compel them to return, he replied that he could not force them to do so, and have them lose their positions for a few weeks only.\n\nWere we to accept such reasoning, the class would soon empty, for when one has taken this liberty the others quickly imitate the example. Is the law to be interpreted at will? If so, why need we hold so much to their daily attendance, if they are free to work when they please? That they leave at fifteen, it is just, but when they have two or three months more to remain before being of age to work, I consider it leniency on the Agent's part not to oblige them to finish the term.\n\nShould they not remain till they are fifteen? Personal experience has taught us that the parents do not resist when the law is placed before them. A little help from the Agent and the truant officer would soon settle this difficulty.\n\nSecondly\u2014Are parents free to withdraw their children at anytime to accompany them on their trips abroad to sell bead-work? This is another great disturbance.\n\nKindly inform me of the course to be\ntaken concerning these questions. The Agent would be pleased to know how the law of compulsory education should be interpreted.\n\nTrusting to receive a satisfactory reply,\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. D.C. Scott,\nDeputy Sup. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nCaughnawaga, May 24, 1917.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nKindly inform me at your earliest convenience if the same grant as last year will be allowed for the pupils' premiums, - that is, $20.00 per school.\n\nTrusting to receive a favorable reply,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. D.

He further tells me that a number of delinquents have returned to school; this I am glad to know. I do not like to have to resort to compulsion unless forced to. I will, however, expect our truant officer to render you every assistance in your work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Sister M. Joseph Edward,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga Indian Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMr. D.J. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy Secretary,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI take the liberty of writing to you today, as I learned from looking over the files of the Department of Indian Affairs that correspondence relating to financial matters was addressed to you. Not being familiar with the workings of the Department, nor how the business is subdivided, you will kindly overlook any mistake my inexperience may have me to make.\n\nWith a view to improving the conditions in both the Reserve Schools under my direction, and thereby ensuring better results in school-work and discipline, I went over the ground very minutely with your Agent, Mr. Brosseau, pointing out to him that which in my estimation is a serious drawback to the progress of the School. Mr. Brosseau advised me to inform the Department of existing conditions and he was of the opinion that the Officials would be glad to have any suggestion on the matter which might prove helpful.\n\n1. A number of the older desks in the class-rooms are giving away, the castings are broken and it is impossible to have them repaired.\n\n2. The number of hooks in the dressing-rooms is insufficient for the number of pupils, more than half the original number have been broken and nails substituted. The result is that the clothing falls on the floor, and you can easily see the consequences.\n\n3. The Reading Charts are very much worn, and the number is insufficient to meet the needs of the children.\n4. The problem of teaching Indian Children to read is extremely difficult because they do not understand the English language. Nothing can be said to interest them, to arouse their attention. It is but a dry repetition of sounds, words and letters. We can appeal to the eye and ear only, the mind we cannot reach.\n\n5. Blackboards in the Girls' School is inadequate. A board about four feet long and two wide is available for fifty-five tots learning to read and write. Can you imagine the success forthcoming?\n\n6. The desks in two classes of the Girls' School are not fastened to the floor, because they have to be removed so often during the year. (These classes are in the assembly room) There is no possibility of keeping ink in these desks, and teaching writing under such difficulties is not an easy task.\n\nI venture to suggest the following for your kind consideration.\n\n1. That the Department fit up the First class in the Boys' School with 30 new single desks, thus allowing us to use the 20 double desks there now to replace those which are broken in the other class-rooms and which have to be cast aside.\n\n2. That one gross of good strong hooks be shipped to the school, and fastened in the ward-rob\u00e9s, with that number on hand we will be able to replace the broken ones according to the needs.\n\n3. That one good set of illustrated Reading Charts be placed in the Receiving Room of each school.\n\n4. That an allowance of a few dollars be made to enable the Principal to purchase a variety of objects to present to the children that they may more easily learn their names. Introduce a \"See and Say\" method. During this month the children have learned Fifty name words, and it is surprising to see\nthe interest they show in the work. I would like to see how much we do by trying this method. Five hundred words in the first year is what I hope to realize.\n\n5. That sufficient blackboards be placed in Room No. 4 of Girls' School\n\n6. That the desks be screwed to narrow strips of hard wood. It would hold the castings and give more stability to the desk, besides they could be removed at will.\n\nThese are, Dear Sir, a few of the most pressing needs of the School. If you choose to remedy all of them, or even any of them you will be greatly helping the cause of education on this Reserve.\n\nI noticed that $25.00 a year was allowed in the past for supplying material for the sewing classes in the Girls' School, and on May 7th 1915 a letter from you to the Principal, Sister Mary Edward, granted an allowance of $25.00 yearly for the scrubbing and washing of the towels in the Girls' School. Please inform me if these conditions still exist; and if the same amount will be allowed this school year.\n\nAs we will soon be moving into more roomy and comfortable quarters, and as much of the furniture in this house belongs to the proprietor, we will have to apply to the Department for what will be needed. I have thought of making out an itemized list of what will be required, giving size of rooms, windows, doors etc. Would this in any way help? It might place you in a position to know how much to allow. I will exercise the strictest economy, and ask for only those things which are indispensable.\n\nTrusting that my demands will not opportune you,\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nActing Principal.\nOttawa, October 2, 1917.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo, in which you call the Department's attention to certain matters in connection with the schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve under your charge.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you should furnish Mr. Agent Brosseau with the sizes and number of each size of the single desks which you state are required for the Boys' School. He will be instructed to have any broken desks that can be repaired attended to.\n\nMr. Brosseau will also be directed to furnish a gross of hooks for hanging clothing on in the dressing rooms of the two schools.\n\nYou should state the series of illustrated reading charts you require and where they can be obtained.\n\nKindly furnish Mr. Brosseau with full particulars in regard to the objects which you wish to procure for teaching the children, as they would have to be ordered through the Government Stationery Office.\n\nYou should also give the number and dimensions of the blackboards required for room No. 4 in the Girls' School.\n\nThe Department approves of your suggestion to have the desks in the assembly room attached to strips of wood, so that they will be stable without being screwed to the floor.\n\nThe Department will make an allowance for material for\n\nRev.

Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, October 21, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Rev. Sister Mary Gabriel, Acting Principal of the Caughnawaga Boys' and Girls' Schools, in regard to certain matters in connection with these schools.\n\nThe Sister has been asked to furnish you with the sizes and number of each size of the single desks which she states are required for the Boys' School; to state the series of illustrated reading charts she desires; to furnish full particulars in regard to the objects which she wishes to procure for teaching the children; to give the number and dimensions of the blackboards required for room No. 4 in the Girls' School and also to prepare a list of the furniture and fixtures required for the new residence for the teachers. When you receive this information you will be good enough to forward it to the Department.\n\nThe Sister also states that a number of the desks in the class-rooms are broken. You will be good enough to see that any of the desks that can be repaired are attended to at once.\n\nYou are hereby authorized to purchase a gross of coat hooks for the dressing rooms in the two schools.\n\nYou should also have the desks in the assembly room attached to strips of wood, so that they will be stable without being screwed to the floor.\n\nJ.

I have investigated the causes and have learned that many people could well avoid this if they really had any desire for the education of their children. I would suggest that the Indian Agent be authorized to put a bar on this wholesale moving and require parents to provide for their children in some manner.\n\nAs matters stand now 50% of the Indian children are running the streets of Lachine, Montreal etc. from November 15th to April 15th.\n\nUnless something is done to stop this wholesale the whole work of education here is reduced to nothing, as we cannot reach more than half of the children.\nSir,\n\nRegarding the young pupils of Baughnawage from 5 to 10 years of age, I recommend both sexes attend to the newer schools each of them. In this effect I had an interview with Rev. Walter Grant St. Superior, and both have no objection to this change, and I ask the Department for their authorization.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nMarch 7th, 1918\nSir,\n\nEnclosed my Report for February of Girls' & Boys' School at Oaigshkawaga. I beg to point out to Department that the decrease of the number of pupils on the Roll is due to the fact that many families have moved to Lachine in November & December last, but they are now coming back. In the afternoon of March 1st it was the solemn distribution of testimonials for the month of February at Girls' School in presence of parents; 126 pupils were present, 66 boys & 60 girls. The good standing of all the pupils drew the attention of all those who were present. In February 24 boys & 16 girls did not miss a day & were never late. I made an examination of 14 young pupils, 9 boys & 5 girls aged from 6 to 8 years, who began to learn letters last September, and who have not missed a day since the beginning of the year, and I was surprised at the progress of these young pupils: all read fluently, in the First Reader, spelled correctly by heart, and were clever in the calculation for addition. I took the occasion to point out to parents that...\nSir,\n\nThat when the children attend regularly the school, there is always progress. I regret the annual removing of many families to Lachine for cold months of winter, this is prejudicial to Indian children of Caligna-waga.\n\nAt this visit of the 1st instant, I was accompanied by the Chief J.T. Daillibon, and he seems very satisfied with the place.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M.

Il me dit de plus qu'il \u00e9tait officier de sant\u00e9 de la r\u00e9serve depuis une trentaine d'ann\u00e9es, et qu'il avait l'intention de faire fermer les \u00e9coles jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'\u00e9pid\u00e9mie soit sous contr\u00f4le. Je lui demandai d'attendre que je me sois rendu compte de la gravit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9pid\u00e9mie avant d'ordonner la fermeture des \u00e9coles. J'eus alors une entrevue avec la S\u0153ur Sup\u00e9rieure qui me dit qu'elle n'avait pas encore constat\u00e9 de cas parmi les \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Le Dr Paton me dit que m\u00eame m\u00e9decin ne fit rapport qu'il avait eu d\u00e9j\u00e0 de 75 cas chez ses clients.

Broceau\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.\nActing Deputy Secretary\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 10th instant, with respect to the closing of the schools of Caughnawaga on account of the epidemic of Spanish Grippe, which is prevalent in the village, I have to inform you that on the 7th instant Dr. Patton came to my office and informed me of the epidemic. There were under his care forty-five cases in the village. He told me further that he had been health officer for the reserve for thirty years and that it was his intention to have the schools close until the epidemic was under control.\n\nI told him to wait until I had satisfied myself of the gravity of the epidemic before ordering the closing of the schools. I then had an interview with the Sister Superior, who told me that she had not yet found any cases among the pupils. On the 9th instant the same doctor reported to me that he had upwards of seventy-five cases under his care. The principal of the school told me that several pupils were away on account of illness of which she did not know the nature.\n\nI then had an interview with the Rev. Father Gras, who seemed perfectly well informed of the situation, and we decided to close the schools immediately and to inform the Department of it for approval, and not to re-open them until the epidemic was under control. At the time of my last visit there had been no deaths, but the cases were becoming more and more numerous. I would ask the Department, therefore, for authority to disinfect the schools and for instructions with respect to re-opening.\n\nYour, &c.,\n\nJ. M. Brossard,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 29, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant reporting in regard to the closing of the schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve on account of the epidemic of Spanish Grippe.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that your action in this matter is approved and the schools should remain closed as long as Dr. Patton considers it necessary. Before re-opening you will be good enough to see that the schools are disinfected.\n\nYou will be good enough to instruct the teachers, when making out their returns for the current quarter, to state thereon the number of days the schools were closed on this account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

A number of families have moved to Lachine, others have gone to Toronto, and some children are still at home on account of illness. It is, however, impossible to state just yet how many children will remain on the reserve during the winter.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Duncan C.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nSister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga (R.C.) Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nMy dear Mr. Scott,\n\nIn reply to your kind inquiry I would say that the travelling expenses of five teachers to and from Montreal would be between $8.00 and $10.00 for each visit, depending on the season and difficulty of transportation. In summer when the motor boats are running, the trip is less expensive via Lachine, but from now until May 1st, we will have to travel by train from Adirondack Junction. The cost of a conveyance to and from the station would be the most expensive item.\n\nWe will have our annual Christmas tree celebration on the evening of Dec. 23rd. The Reverend Pastor, the gentlemen of the Kanawaki Golf Club, the Mayor of the Village and a few others have contributed to fill the dear children's stockings. We will hold suitable exercises in keeping with the season and the events of the day. The predominant note will be \"Peace with Victory.\"\n\nWe will await orders from the Department regarding how or when we shall make up for the time lost during the epidemic. We will surely cancel the Easter vacation, but it will be very hard to get the Indian children to come to school either during Christmas or New Year's week.\n\nThanking you again for the kind consideration you are giving to my request,\n\nI am, dear Mr. Scott,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel\nPrincipal\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDecember 7, 1918.\n\nDear Madam,-\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with further reference to the attendance of the Caughnawaga teachers at the Pedagogical Conferences in Montreal.\n\nI regret that I cannot see my way clear to undertake the obligation of paying the expenses involved, which are considerably greater than I anticipated they would be when I last wrote you.\n\nI hope that your Christmas festivities will be most enjoyable, and I wish to extend to yourself, the teachers and the children of the schools my best wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Happy and Prosperous New Year.\n\nI agree with you that it would not be well to ask the children to attend school during the Christmas vacation, to make up for the time lost during the epidemic. You may, however, keep open during the week following Easter Monday, and, further than that, I do not think it will be necessary for you to call upon the children to make up the time so unfortunately lost owing to the epidemic.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal, Caughnawaga Indian Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nOttawa, June 30th, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nIt appears from the returns of the Caughnawaga Boys' and Girls' schools, that a number of the pupils have reached the highest standard at a comparatively early age and, that they continue to cover the same work for two or three years.\n\nIn the majority of such cases, if not, in all, there are several difficulties, which prevent such children from obtaining higher education, and, it would appear advisable that some provision should be made to enable them to pursue higher studies, in their own schools.\n\nIn many of the smaller towns of Ontario, there are continuation classes where pupils, who have completed the public school course, receive the same instruction as if they were attending a High School or Collegiate Institute.\n\nKnowing your interest in Indian education the Department deemed it necessary to consult you, before taking definite action. Possibly, with your knowledge of the Quebec system of education, you could suggest some workable plan, which would prove acceptable to the Department.\n\nA.L.

Now they have little incentive to remain in the district for a second year, and leave school to earn some third of employment.

I was greatly pleased with the results that they have achieved since my last visit to these schools, shortly after the installation of the Sisters. The school-rooms were bright, clean and cheery, and the class-room work was highly satisfactory. Mr. Gilman, the Public School Inspector, stated that the work compared favourably with that done in the best schools in his Inspectorate. The attendance in each of the rooms was large and an examination of the register showed that since the opening of spring it has been very regular.\n\nThe crowding in the Junior class-room of the Girls' School is very noticeable and the Department will have to consider means of relieving the situation, but this is a matter that can be dealt with at a later date.\n\nI made special enquiries regarding the establishment of a continuation class and I am convinced not only that such action would be beneficial to the children of the village but is almost a necessity. There are at the present time in the Boys' class-room five boys who will complete their studies in so far as the ordinary course is concerned at the summer holidays. There are none in the girls' school at the present time but there are prospective students for another year. The object of the continuation class would be to give further instruction in English and a general commercial course, including bookkeeping, typewriting and stenography. Mr. Gilman also suggests instruction in French, which is very essential to young men or women entering commercial life in the city of\nMontreal or other cities in the Province of Quebec. The establishment of such a course would to a great extent relieve the Department of the obligation at present existing of defraying in whole or in part the expenses of the boys or girls who have to be sent to Business Colleges in Montreal to obtain the rudiments of commercial training.\n\nThe building formerly used in connection with the Methodist Mission would be available and the only expense involved would be the maintenance and heating of the building and the payment of the teacher's salary, the latter about $800.00 per annum. Having in mind the excellence of the work performed by the Sisters of St. Anne during the few years they have been in charge of these schools, I think there is no doubt that they would make an equal success of a commercial class. They have now on the staff 8 fully qualified Sisters and one Lay teacher without qualifications, who however, has a knowledge of the Indian language and whose services in the primary class are almost indispensable.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

My reason for appearing to press you in the matter will be apparent when I tell you that the appointment to the different branch houses of the Order are made about the middle of July, and if we need an extra teacher here I will have to file an application very soon. Teachers qualified to carry on this kind of work are at a premium just now, and once each house will have been given its quota of Sisters the Principals will be very unwilling to give up one of their teachers for this house, or in fact for any house. Consequently if you have reached a conclusion I would be very grateful to know it as soon as possible.\n\nI furthermore wish to call your kind attention to the fact that the Junior classes in both schools are overcrowded for at least five months in the year; September, October, April, May, and June. This last year I employed a young girl to help the Sister in charge of the Girl's School (Primary Class) and another to assist for one and a half hours each day in the Boy's School. I did this because I felt the work was too strenuous for the Sisters, but I paid them out of our own salary, and expended $400.00 for that purpose. The Department pays for eight teachers while we have had the services of ten for a part of the year. You readily understand that we cannot do this always unless the Department gives an allowance for the payment of Assistant teachers at least during the months when the attendance is greatest, and I wish to submit this to your consideration.\n\nIt is in the lower classes that the foundations are laid and unless the children are well started, their whole school life will suffer thereby. Thirty pupils are quite sufficient for any te...\nunder ordinary conditions, when you take into consideration that in this school these thirty children do not understand a word of the teacher is saying, you will realize what an output of energy is necessary to develop their little minds, and teach them the very elements of the English language. In the Primary Class of the Girls' School there was a total registration of 79 pupils this year; the average registration was 46.7 and the average attendance was 39.62. In the Boys' School the total registration was 78; the average registration was 42 and the average attendance was 35.45. My suggestion would be to authorize the Principal to employ an Assistant during the months when the attendance is above 30 pupils.\n\nI have made out a few statistics for my own satisfaction which may be of interest as showing the increase in Registration, average Registration, average attendance and the percent of attendance based on the average registration during the three years of my principalship here.\n\n| Year | Total Regis. | Av. Regis. | Av. Attend. | Percent |\n|------|--------------|------------|-------------|---------|\n| 1918 | 161          | 123.5      | 95          | 77      |\n| 1919 | 168          | 124.7      | 98          | 79      |\n| 1920 | 183          | 133        | 111.6       | 88      |\n\n| Year | Total Regis. | Av.

I have decided to give this class a trial commencing with the fall term, and I shall be pleased to pay a reasonable salary for a qualified teacher, who will give instruction in English and a general commercial course, including bookkeeping, typewriting and stenography.

Deputy and Secretary.\nTeachers Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Que. July 16, 1920.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nImmediately upon receipt of your letter I filed an application for a qualified teacher for a Commercial Class and I am pleased to state that I have obtained the services of one of our very best teachers. This Sister has twelve years experience in teaching; she knows French quite well, and all the Commercial subjects are perfectly familiar to her. Under her direction I feel certain the school will be a success. I conferred with the Authorities at the Mother-house regarding salary expected and I was told that in view of the fact that we were lodged, heated, lighted etc here $850.00 would be considered a reasonable salary for this Special Teacher.\n\nI wish to thank you, My dear Mr. Scott, for so generously refunding the amount expended this year for Assistant Teachers in the Schools. I certainly did not expect this mark of consideration on your part, so it is all the more appreciated. I wish to thank you also for the favor of being allowed to employ Assistant teachers when necessary and I beg to assure you that I shall not abuse of the privilege.\n\nThe work of painting and repairing the Schools is well under way, and under Mr. Chene's vigilant care every thing is being satisfactorily done. The basement is in perfect condition and we will be able to use it as a waiting room during rain and stormy weather. You just cannot imagine what a great blessing you are\nbestowing upon the Teachers in thus providing for the material comfort of their charges.\n\nThe question of our accommodations must give you some concern as I understand the Jacobs family want their house. It seems too bad for we were perfectly satisfied here; yet we well understand how unreasonable it would be to rent the house at such an exorbitant rate for only one year when especially a new furnace must be installed. Mr. Brosseau suggested the Patton Estate, and I visited the place in case the question should come up for discussion. I consider the property of more value than this in many respects, but it is not as well suited for our needs; it could, however, be adapted to our wants very easily. Sleeping apartments for twelve adults take up quite a little space in a house; yet unless teachers are comfortably housed and well fed it is most unreasonable to expect good work. If the work of Teachers of this School has been satisfactory to you, these last few years you may consider that the very comfortable home you provided for us has contributed in no small measure to that success. With your broad experience you realized this and while the outlay is somewhat great at the start it pays in the end. Whatever you will decide in the matter will be satisfactory as I know you shall look with especial care to the proper accommodations for the Teachers as an essential factor in producing good and lasting results in educational work.\n\nWith renewed thanks for your kindness,\n\nI am, dear Mr. Scott,\n\nYours very cordially,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is the largest registration in the annals of the Schools. Three hundred thirty pupils. In September 1919 we registered 274. Gain of 36 pupils.\n\n2. In September 1919 the percentage of attendance based on enrollment in the Boys' school was 88%. This year it is 93%.\n\n3. In the Girls' school the percentage of attendance is smaller because 15 or 20 girls did not register until the end of the month.\n\n4. By special permission from the Deputy Minister we are allowed to employ Assistant Teachers in the primary grades when necessary. This month we employed two and pay them $30.00 per month.\n\n5. The classrooms are crowded. In the Girls' School, primary room there are 16 x 18 children who have no seats. The maximum capacity of the room is 42 and there are 60. This will ease off in the winter, but in the mean time it is a great inconvenience.\n\n6. I recommend that the Department devise means of opening a new classroom in the spring of 1921. A temporary class might be opened in some vacant house which could be fitted up during the winter, and made ready for the influx in April.\n7. Progress is delayed in the Continuation School because the children have no books. I have written and requested the Superintendent of Stationery to kindly give personal attention to our Requisition.\n\n8. Children show more interest in the work and parents hesitate about keeping the children out of school. Truancy is due to neglect of parents rising in time to prepare children for school. There is improvement in this respect.\n\nRespectfully yours,\nSister Mary Gabriel\nPrincipal\n\nNote - Charges for account charged (unwritten - would be $16.50/72/3 and $15.36/5/27/3)\nOctober 7, 1920.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMy attention has been recalled to the very large enrolment and average attendance at the Caughnawaga schools and to the necessity of making provision for further classroom accommodation. I am assured by my officers who have visited the reserve during the last few years that these schools are exceedingly creditable institutions. I hope that the Indians are appreciating what the Department is doing for them by way of providing thorough education for their children. There is a limit, however, to the expenditure that the Government should be called upon to make, and it would appear that the time has arrived when the Indians themselves will have to bear at least a portion of the burden, not only in providing additional accommodation if necessary, but also assisting in the maintenance of the schools, including salaries, fuel, etc., etc.\n\nI am writing you to be good enough to bring this up for discussion in your Council at some meeting in the near future, and I shall be glad to know the result of your deliberations.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nP. J. Delisle, Esq.,\nMayor,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nOttawa, October 11, 1920.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo regarding the attendance of Indian children at the schools under your supervision on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is very pleased to learn of the large attendance. The question of providing extra class-rooms to accommodate the children will receive consideration.\n\nThe salary of the two assistant teachers in the primary grades for the month of September, last, is being paid.\n\nThe Department is pleased to learn that the parents are showing more interest in the education of their children.\n\nIt is hoped that you have received all the books which you require for the Continuation School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

During this quarter 335 pupils were registered, 45 more than in December 1919. 27 pupils, 18 girls + 9 boys registered on this roll have moved outside the reserve. 21 will return in the spring, the other 8 have gone to school elsewhere.\n\n120 other pupils not registered on this report, but whose names were on the September Report are also away temporarily and will return in the spring. There are presently 306 children attending school every day. During the quarter 114 children did not miss one single day, and 37 missed one day. 29 missed two days. As you may see by the figures above, the attendance is very good.\n\nThe new Tenant Officer, Mr. Locks, made has given a great help to the teachers in lessening the cases of tardiness.\n\nThe Sisters report they have difficulty in keeping the children.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Their supply of scribblers ran out early in December, and they have used every scrap of paper available, foolscap, scratch pads, wrapping paper etc., etc. Their last requisition for scribblers and pencils has not been filled.\n\nAs some repairs to desks in Girls' School were needed, I put a man to make the repairs in question during the Christmas holiday.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M.Brosseau\nIndian Agent\n\nMr. Sutherland, Esq.,\nIn charge of Schools,\nOttawa\nOttawa, January 3, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo enclosing the quarterly returns from the Indian schools in the Village of Caughnawaga.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department notes with a great deal of pleasure the splendid attendance of the Indian children during the quarter. This is due to the interest taken by the children in their work, a greater interest on the part of the parents in the education of their children and the good work being performed by the Reverend Sisters. A certain amount of credit is also due Mr. Jocke, the truant officer.\n\nIt is hoped that a supply of scribblers and pencils will go forward very shortly. Owing to the shortage of paper it has been difficult for the Stationery Department to fill all orders.\n\nThe Department will take up with the E. N. Moyer Co. the question of the parts needed to repair the desks in the Continuation School.\n\nIt is noted that you have had the repairs required to the desks in the Girls' School completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. M. Brosseau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nM.B. Since writing this I received from the Soldier Civil Re-establishment a quantity of scribblers and note books. If these supplies are sent the question of paper will be settled for some few months.\n\nThere is still a large supply of paper here which could be very well utilized in the schools if the Department agrees to allow us to have it we will be very grateful indeed.\n\nSr M Gabriel\nMy dear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter regarding the house furnishing, I wish to say that what you suggest will be entirely satisfactory to me.\n\nI wish to call your attention to the fact that the supply of scribblers purchased Jan. 10th is fairly well exhausted, and will not last until the end of the present month. I have sent in a new requisition to the Department, but so far only 100 loose-leaf books have been sent. These contain only a few pages (64) and will last no time. My request is for authority to get scribblers here if we run short before supplies reach us.\n\nI further wish to call your attention to the case of one boy, Disha, whose father is unable to work through the loss of a limb; this child although over eight years old, has never attended school. The mother told me that he had no clothes, and stated that if I could supply him with boots, stockings, underwear, and a cap, she would gladly send the child to school. I wish to know the attitude of the Department in such cases. If assistance cannot be given to these people, I would much appreciate the fact so I might dislike to have overweight children in the Indian Class. Boys who run the streets until the age of nine, know too much for our little boys of six or seven. They exercise a bad influence over them; therefore I like to have the children in at six and keep them out of mischief.\n\nLastly I wish to state that in applying for bolts to replace those broken in the desks of the Commercial Class, I asked for six, and sent a sample to Mr. Sutherland, and another to your address, because it was claimed that the first one did not reach the Department. The Laver Co. sent only two, so we are not much better off. The Iron O'saline have been shipped to St. Constant, and we have just heard that the twelve missing boxes are in.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel\n\nMr. R. B. McLean,\nAsst.

He told me to write to the head of the Schools' Branch, expressing the conditions and asking for instructions as to the course we are to follow.\n\nI already stated that the number of children in regular attendance at the schools had greatly increased, and while the space in the Primary Class of the Girls' School offers facilities for expansion to meet the conditions, no such arrangement can be made in the Boys' School. In this school there are at the present time the following number of children:\n\n| Class | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1st    | 29 boys - 2 away will return in March |\n| 2nd    | 34 \"   - 1 away |\n| 3rd    | 35 \"   - 3 \" |\n| 4th    | 40 \"   - 4 to return |\n\nThe seating capacity of the 3rd class is 54, but we may add four seats which we have already done, but the seating capacity of the 4th class is 40 and there are 48 pupils present besides 4 in decline, and 14 or 16 to come as soon as the weather conditions permit. We cannot add another seat here, so the question arises what are we to do? Two courses are open. Either refuse to accept any other children, or rent a room in the vicinity to accommodate them, and this is the proposition I submit to you, and through you, to the other officials who may have a word to say in the matter.\n\nMr. Brossard will visit this afternoon, a hall which is vacant, and used for social gatherings only; if it is at all suitable, he will report the matter to you, and if it meets your views, we may rent it and get it ready for the term beginning April 1st. Until then we will manage the best we can, and will refuse no pupils until the Department has come to a decision.\n\nI am writing in order to give the Department ample time and opportunity to consider the matter.\n\nTrusting you will give these requests your kind attention.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department has taken over all the supplies of this kind from them and it is hoped that the books now being sent you will be found of use and that you can use them either as exercise books or scribblers in the schools. I may say that we have quite a stock of the same kind of books in the Department and if you could find use for any more of them kindly let us know. The Stationery Office here have had difficulty in obtaining a supply of scribblers and exercise books on account of a shortage of paper. They will, no doubt, fill your requisition in a short time and, in the meantime, you can use the supply now being sent you.\n\nRegarding the broken bolts for the desks in the Continuation School, I beg to say that the E. N. Moyer Co. are being requested to forward four more of these bolts. It is noted that the missing braces have arrived.\n\nRegarding the case of the Diabault boy, who requires some clothing, I beg to say that Mr. Agent Brosseau is being written to and requested to supply him with the articles mentioned by you. This is, however, not to be taken as a precedent, as the Department could not undertake to clothe all the children on the Caughnawaga Reserve who require it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

She states that this child, although eight years old, has never attended school, the reason being that he has no clothes. The Rev. Sister asks that the Department supply him with a pair of books, stockings, underwear and a cap.\n\nI shall, therefore, be pleased if you will arrange for the purchase of one pair of boots, two pairs of stockings, two suits of underwear and a cap for this boy. These articles, while serviceable, should be obtained as cheaply as possible. You should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nI may say that this is not to be considered as a precedent, as the Department could not undertake to supply clothing to every child on the Caughnawaga Reserve who might ask for it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I beg to assure you that I shall not take the habit of doing this, for really the children are, as a rule, very neatly and comfortably clad to come to school; this is the second case that has come under my observation.\n\nThe supplies promised will be most welcome and anything and everything the Department takes over in the line of Stationery we will utilize and turn into account.\n\nI am sorry to have to say that there is just now an epidemic of colds, grippe, measles, mumps and whooping cough among the children, keeping quite a number of them out of school. There have been no serious cases, however.\n\nThanking you for your kind interest in the schools.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very cordially,\nSister Mary Gabriel\nPrincipal\n\nMr. L.D. McLean\nAs Deputy & Sec.\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nJe dois attirer l'attention du D\u00e9partement sur le fait que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves de l'Ecole des Gar\u00e7ons de Baie-Comeau sont trop nombreux pour la capacit\u00e9 des diff\u00e9rentes classes, surtout celle des premiers. Je pr\u00e9vois que aux premiers beaux jours de printemps, les institutrices se trouveront dans la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de refuser les nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e8ves faute d'espace. Si Mme Gabriel m'a inform\u00e9 qu'elle avait mis le D\u00e9partement au courant de cette situation et que pour y rem\u00e9dier, il faudrait louer une salle qu'on pourrait am\u00e9nager pour la circonstance. Elle a parl\u00e9 de la salle Goodleaf situ\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9tage sup\u00e9rieur de la salle de pool de John Delormier. Cette salle serait convenable si ce n'\u00e9tait que les fen\u00eatres de pool qui sont en bas.\n\nJohn Delormier m'a offert sa maison voisine de l'Ecole des Gar\u00e7ons, pour un loyer de $25.00 par mois. Alors j'ai cru qu'il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de convertir mon bureau en classe, et de louer pour l'agent un bureau dans une maison priv\u00e9e, ce qui reviendrait beaucoup moins cher.\nSir,\n\nIl serait \u00e0 nos soins pour le D\u00e9partement de consid\u00e9rer imm\u00e9diatement cette situation et de m'envoyer les instructions n\u00e9cessaires afin que nous soyons pr\u00eats pour le commencement de l'ann\u00e9e prochaine.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nJ.M. Brossard\nAgent des Sauvages\n\nJ.D. McLean\nSecr\u00e9tariat du Secr\u00e9taire\nOttawa\nTranslation.\n\nSt. Constant, Que.,\nMarch 5, 1921\n\nSir:\n\nI must bring the attention of your Department to the fact that the pupils of the Boys' Schools of Caughnawaga are too numerous for the capacity of the different classes, especially that of the beginners. I foresee that on the first fine days of spring the teachers will be under the necessity of refusing entrance to the new pupils, for lack of space.\n\nSister Mary Gabriel has informed me that she had already informed the Department of this situation, and that, to remedy it, it would be necessary to rent a hall, which could be furnished for the circumstances. She spoke to me of the Goodleaf hall situated above the pool-room of John Delorimier. That hall would be convenient if it were not for the pool-room which is below. John Delorimier has offered me his house next to the Boys' School for $25.00 per month rent. I then thought it would be preferable to convert my office into a class-room and to rent for the agent an office in a private house, which would certainly cost much less.\n\nIt would be well for the Department to take this situation into immediate consideration and to send me the necessary instructions, so as to remedy it before the beginning of next month.\n\nYours, etc.\n\nJ. M. Brosseau,\nIndian Agent.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nJe dois r\u00e9p\u00e9ter le D\u00e9partement \u00e0 ma lettre du 5 octobre \u00e0 propos de l'\u00e9cole des gar\u00e7ons de Longueuil o\u00f9 les \u00e9l\u00e8ves se trouvent trop pr\u00e8s de l'\u00e9troit. Je vous informe que John Delormier demandait $25.00 par mois pour la maison de son p\u00e8re situ\u00e9e \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9cole des gar\u00e7ons. Rev. Sr Mary Gabriel tient beaucoup \u00e0 cette maison qui lui serait tr\u00e8s commode, et elle m'a inform\u00e9 que Delormier est dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 louer pour $150.00 par ann\u00e9e. Comme cette salle accom- moderait mieux les institutrices que mon bureau, je vous la recom- mande.\n\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur,\n\nJ.M. Brocasson\nAgent des Sauvages\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.\nAss. Dep. & Sec.\nOttawa\nSir,-\n\nIn reference to my letter of the 5th instant to the Department, concerning the boys' school of Caughnawaga, where the pupils are presently congested, I was informing you that John Delorimier was asking $25.00 per month for the house of his late father, situated at proximity of the boys' school.\n\nReverend Sister Mary Gabriel wishes very much to secure that house which would be very handy and she informs me that Delorimier is disposed to rent it for $150.00 for the year.\n\nAs this house will accommodate the teachers much better than my office, I recommend it to the Department.\n\nYours, etc.\n\n(SGD) J. M. Brosseau,\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nOttawa.\nMarch 18, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letters of March 5th and 15th, with reference to the renting of a house to be used for school-rooms for boys on the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve.\n\nBefore taking any decision in this matter, I would ask you to inform me of the rental per month which would have to be paid by the Department for your office in case this location should be adopted as an additional class-room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M. Brosseau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 18th instant regarding the rental per month I would have to pay for my office in case my actual office should be adopted as an additional class-room, I beg to say it is $5.00 per month. But the house at the disposition of the Department near Boys' School is much preferable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M. Brosseau\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nActing Deputy Secretary\nOttawa\nOttawa, March 30, 1921.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nRe Additional Class-room, Caughnawaga Schools\n\nAfter further communication with Mr. Brosseau regarding this matter, it is considered advisable to rent John Delorimier's house, which is situated near the Boys' School, at a rental of $150.00 per year. This location would be more advantageous to both the pupils and teachers and would also provide more accommodation. Will you please advise whether the Principal's request is to be given immediate consideration.\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nWould you be good enough to inform me if the Department has reached any conclusion regarding the necessity of opening a class to relieve the congested condition of the Primary Class at the Boys' School. I strongly requested Mr. Agent Brossard to rent the house belonging to Mr. John Delorme which is close to the school, and which he offers for $150.00 per year. Mr. Brossard had thought of his offer but objected because it would be too far away, and it would be impossible for me to give the class the attention it needed. This house would answer the purpose until some steps are taken to enlarge the school here.\n\nYou will see by the Report which must have reached you that we have 106 children more registered this March 31st than on a similar date in 1920.\n\nI have been obliged to have many of the old desks repaired and placed in the class rooms to suit the needs.\nI trust that you were good enough to order desks for the class room, similar to those sent quite recently for the Girls' School. These have been fitted and installed in the stage of the Assembly room and are most satisfactory.\n\nI would ask you if we may hope to receive the furniture, bedsteads, matresses etc., selected from the Soldier's Civil Re-establishment here early in February. As I already pointed out we are short of beds, and I would be grateful indeed to know when we may expect to receive these promised.\n\nWe received some few days ago the articles forwarded from Ottawa and all have been very profitably utilized. The hall tree just fits the corner, and our new home is gradually becoming more and more \"home-like.\"\n\nTrusting that you will give your kind attention to these little details,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very cordially,\n\n[Signature]\nLester Mary Gabriel\nPrincipal\n\nMr. L. D. McLean\nActing Deputy Secretary.\nExtract from Agent's Report on the Caughnawaga Boys School for the month of March, 1921. Original on 153652-7\n\nQuarters for the Primary Boys School must be provided as there is no place to put the children. I strongly recommend the house adjoining Boys' School (Delormier)\n\nJ. M. Brosseau,\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, April 22nd, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to report in connection with the proposition of renting the house of the late Peter K. Delorimier for the purpose of using as class rooms for the Boys School, that I had several interviews with the joint owners of the estate, Mrs. Peter K. Delorimier widow and the son, John O. Delorimier, and both are decidedly unwilling to rent the house while the ownership is vested jointly. Each, however, expressed willingness to rent for school purposes when the division of the estate is made and the rental offered - $150.00 per annum appeared satisfactorily to both. The house is at present occupied by John O. Delorimier.\n\nSister Superior of the school showed considerable anxiety for an immediate provision for an increased accommodation of the Boys School. The School is now taxed to its utmost capacity and she fears that when all the boys return, now absent on account of measles, she will be compelled to turn some away from the school.\n\nWith the view of meeting the emergency of the situation, the matter of making a division of the Delorimier estate should be expedited by the Agent, and with your permission I will give the matter a personal interest from this end of the administration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nChas. A. Cooke\nMy dear Sir,\n\nThe kind interest you have taken in the progress of the schools here prompts me to ask you to be my interpreter with the school authorities of the Department in obtaining that the grant of $20.00 per school allowed for prizes at the end of the term be increased to $25.00 with an additional $10.00 for the continuation School. The price of books has not varied and we have fully one hundred children more in regular attendance than last year.\n\nIt has been rumored here that an official from the Department will be in Laughnawaga this coming week; would it be too much to ask that this gentleman would spare a few minutes of his very precious time to visit the continuation class. I would very much wish that some one could dispose of a few moments to give a little talk to the children.\nwould be a source of encouragement to both teachers and pupils.\n\nWe will have eighteen pupils who will finish the 6th Standard this June, and who will be promoted to the Continuation School. Nine girls and nine boys.\n\nThe pupils of the Business Course who have attained a speed of 100 words a minute will receive a Diploma from the Perrottet Stenographic Institute. There is a fee of a few dollars to cover expense of examination, etc. Shall we charge it to the individual pupils or shall the Department defray the expense?\n\nThe crowded condition of the Boys' Primary class is still unsettled. Twenty and seventy-five little fellows have to crowd in when they may comfortably sit. Fortunately an epidemic of measles kept a number out of school for a few weeks, but they are all back now full of spring life.\n\nWith much esteem,\n\nI am, dear Mr. McKenzie,\n\nYours very cordially,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel\n\nPrincipal\n\nMr. A.T. McKenzie\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nMay 16th, 1921.\n\nDear Sister Mary Gabriel,\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant. The Department will be pleased to honour vouchers for prizes to the extent of $25.00 for each school instead of $20.00 as heretofore, and also allow you $10.00 for prizes for the Continuation Class.\n\nI am pleased to note that you are meeting with success in this particular class. Mr. Williams, our Law Clerk, is going to Caughnawaga this week but as he has some investigations to conduct it is doubtful whether he will find time to visit the school. If possible, however, I am sure he will be glad to devote a short period to this purpose.\n\nI note your remarks with regard to the overcrowding of the boys' school, and I hope we will be able to do something in the near future.\n\nWith kind regards, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. L.,\nSecretary to the Deputy.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nOttawa, May 18, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nRev. Sister Mary Gabriel, supervising principal of the Caughnawaga Indian Day Schools, has requested that she be allowed to purchase prizes to the extent of $25.00 instead of $20.00 as formerly allowed for each of the Boys' and Girls' Schools, and also to the extent of $10.00 for the Continuation Class.\n\nShe has been informed that she may purchase prizes for these schools to the above amount. She will, no doubt, forward the vouchers covering the purchase to you, which you will be good enough to attach to proper voucher forms and certify for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D.

I found that almost everything of value had been taken away. There remained a few tables and book together with other odds and ends that I selected for use in the schools here.\n\nI noticed a large quantity of tools of every kind and description, bolts, locks, pans, hammers, axes, shovels, spades, hewing, belting etc etc. The officer in charge told me we could have all we wanted of this stock. Of course I am not competent to judge of what might be useful and suggested sending over Capt. Baker, Mr. Peter Hall, there to select what could be used in the different buildings here. Would you therefore kindly send me a note\nauthorizing Peter Vian, to select for the Department of Indian Affairs whatever would be useful. The official in charge urged me to take all we could of this stock as they are closing up.\n\nI further noticed several type-writers in good condition, and would gladly have taken two or three, but the Officer stated they had received orders to ship these to the Stationery Department in Ottawa. Do you think you could manage to get a permit of some kind to allow us to get a few of them for our Commercial Class? It would save the expense of sending them to Ottawa, and we surely do not need new typewriters for practice. I think it would be a great economy to obtain these.\n\nI selected a quantity of school material mostly book-keeping blanks, they may be utilized as writing books for our children and if I get all that is there we will be supplied for a few years. The supply sent from Ottawa in January is almost exhausted. I kept some of the most valuable books for ink blanks as I considered it a waste to allow children to scribble on such fine paper. I purchased a few hundred scribbled for\nrough work, and kept the finer paper for\nEcclesi books for next year.\n\nWe have finally opened a new class, and\nin a few days I shall send in a requisition\nfor desks etc. In the meantime, and until\nthe end of the school year we will manage\nwith the old benches etc. There will be\nforty boys in this class, and 40 or more\nin the other.\n\nPraying that you will kindly give your\nattention to these details,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\nYours very respectfully,\nSister Mary Gabriel\nPrincipal\n\nMrs. L.

Mr. Viau should see that the articles selected are shipped to Caughnawaga, and that they are received.\n\nWith reference to the typewriters which you require for the Commercial Class, I beg to say that we will, no doubt, be able to supply second-hand typewriters, in good condition, which would serve the purpose, from the stock which the Stationery Office have on hand here. You will kindly state the number you will require, and the make.\n\nIf there is any school material on hand in the stores of the Soldiers' Civil Re-establishment which could be utilized as writing books for the children, you and Mr. Viau should arrange for their selection and delivery.\n\nIt is noted that you have opened a new class.\n\nIt is hoped to have the lease of the Delorimier House completed in a few days.\n\nIn forwarding a requisition for the desks required, I will be pleased if you will state the sizes, and whether you would prefer single or double desks.

Q.\n\nThe closing was held in the Assembly Hall of the Girls' School, in the presence of the most prominent members of the Caughnawaga Village, who appeared to be greatly interested in the various demonstrations which were given by the pupils on the different subjects studied during the year, especially short-hand and typewriting.\n\nI have no hesitation in stating that their ability and knowledge in the last named subjects can compare favourably with the pupils in our local schools at the same ages.\n\nWith reference to the furniture, etc., to be applied to the new Teacher's residence and Hospital at Caughnawaga, I am pleased to inform you that requisitions for both institutions have now been filled, and everyone concerned is well\nwell pleased with the amount and quality of goods delivered.\n\nThe disagreement about this matter is, therefore, definitely settled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nContest for Gold Medal offered by Mr. J.

An increase of 97 pupils over June 1920.\n\nA 5th class was opened on May 30th to accommodate 41 small boys. An assistant was put in charge under the direction of the Sister in charge of 4th class to finish the year. A regular teacher will take charge in September. The 4th class in Hall School is overcrowded. 75 pupils is too much. An additional class would be a necessity.\n\nThe attendance in the lower classes fell on account of an epidemic of measles which lasted several weeks. Seven pupils from the Continuation School received their diplomas for stenography from the Stenographic Institute of Montreal. Eight received diplomas for typewriting; three from the Montreal Typewriters Company, and five from the Montreal Institute.\nSir,\n\nEighteen pupils completed the work of the 6th standard and were promoted to the Continuation School.\n\nThe educational work of the Indians in Caughnawaga is remarkable, and I am very satisfied of the progress of this year.\n\nI enclose the copies of problems of arithmetic given by myself to give you an idea of the capacity of the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M. Brossard\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.\nActing Deputy Secretary\nOttawa\nOttawa. June 30, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th instant, enclosing the quarterly reports of the schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve under the charge of Rev. Sister Mary Gabriel, as well as examples of the work of the pupils in the arithmetic examination given by you.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is very pleased to learn of the large attendance and the splendid work that is being performed by the Reverend Sisters at these schools and the success which has attended their efforts.\n\nI will be pleased if you will convey to Rev. Sister Mary Gabriel the Department's appreciation of the work that is being performed by them in the Caughnawaga schools. It is also pleasing to know that the Indians appreciate the advantages offered them for the education of their children which is shown by the large and increased attendance.\n\nThe examination papers in arithmetic submitted by you have been looked over with interest. The efforts made by yourself in assisting in the work are also appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nJ. M. Bresseau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nQUE.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6075, file 305-1, part 1A)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI am writing you today, with the sanction of Mr. Agent Brossard, to request that you be good enough to determine what salary the Department will allow the Care Taker for the new addition to the Boys' School i.e., the two classes held in the Delormier Estate. There will be two stoves to look after, two classrooms to sweep and keep in order together with the cleaning, washing and scrubbing four times a year. Do you think $100.00 a year too much? I suggest this as about a reasonable sum.\n\nI further wish you to consider the question of the salary to be paid the 5th teacher in the Boys' School. It is altogether impossible to get a teacher at the price the Department is paying those already engaged there. Consequently either the salaries of the teachers of the school be raised in proportion from $500, $450, $350 and $300 to $550, $500, $450, $400 and $350, or this new teacher be allowed a salary of $650.00.\n\nThe growth of the school is such that we can hardly keep pace with the progress, as a consequence we have to give a room for the typewriters and necessarily a teacher to supervise the work. The hours will not be so long nor the work so strenuous, and I would be willing to accept $300.00 per year for this special teacher.\n\nWhile touching on the question of salaries I would certainly call to your attention the fact that the Principal of the Schools here is underpaid for the work she is called upon to do. In Montreal when a principal has 10 classrooms to look after she is given an Assistant. The schools here are so scattered, the work so strenuous that nothing but sustained and persistent efforts will give any results. While I am quite able to conduct the work here alone for another year or so I would certainly apply for a salary of at least $700.00 per annum.\n\nTrusting that you will give these details your kind attention,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel\nPrincipal\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nP.O.\n\nAttention of Mr. A.F.

We conduct nineteen schools there, and each teacher receives $500.00 per annum regardless of the Grade she teaches with a yearly bonus of $100.00 for those who are especially qualified. You readily understand that the Mother house would not give Sisters to teach here unless they receive a salary equal to what is paid in the other schools. Ours is an organization and it must be conducted on business principles or it would quickly cease its activities. The salaries have not been raised since 1917, and our work here has practically doubled. During the war so many families were away or moved away temporarily that the classes were not heavy, now they are over crowded. None but able bodied strong teachers can stand the strain of work here. If I did not make this appeal before it was because the bonus received brought the salaries to a fair level but I wish to signify that no new teachers will be given for the old rates, hence my suggestion of either paying the new teachers $650.00 and $300.00 respectively or raise the salaries of the teachers at the Boys' School according to the scale submitted.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory to you,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\nYours very cordially,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel\nPrincipal.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention of Mr. A.F. McKenzie.\nOTTAWA, Sept. 7th, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, enclosing a list of the teaching staff of the Caughnawaga Schools showing the salaries at present received as well as the increases which you consider should be granted.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department will approve of the following increases, viz:\n\nTo yourself, as Principal an increase of $200 per annum, which will bring your salary up to $700 per annum;\n\nTo Sisters Mary Rita and Mary Zita an increase of $50 per annum, each, which will bring the salary of the former up to $550 per annum and of the last named up to $500 per annum;\n\nTo Sisters Ann Catherine and Agnes an increase of $100 per annum, each, which will bring the salary of the former up to $450 per annum and of the last named up to $400 per annum.\n\nA salary of $350 per annum will also be allowed for a new teacher in the boys' school, and a salary of $300 per annum for a typewriting assistant for the continuation school will be allowed.\n\nLast year a salary was allowed for two extra teachers, one for the boys' school and one for the girls' school. It is presumed that, in view of the increases in salaries allowed and the list of teachers at each school, there will not be need for the services of these extra teachers during the present year.\n\nThe above increases will date from the first of the current month. Bonus will also be allowed these teachers at the rate of $15.00 per month during the balance of the present fiscal year.\n\nI will be pleased if you will furnish the name of the new teacher secured for the boys' school as well as that of the typewriting assistant in the continuation school, and the qualifications which they possess.\n\nMr. Agent Brossard will be informed of the increases in salaries allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

C. Hill, director of Indian schools in New York state, would do well to visit the Indian schools in Quebec to learn a few things about Indian school management. The Canadian government does not think the fourth grade good enough for an Indian, neither do I. I think the Indians should be taught to write and take part in deportations, etc. The record established by the Indian schools in Quebec is very good and ought to shame the record set by the Indian schools in New York state. The department of Indian affairs has no experience in building and equipping schools on all the Indian reservations in this province and nothing but legally qualified teachers are employed.\n\nOn the Caughnawaga reservation there are two fine brick buildings and two frame buildings. These frame buildings are not to be found in the city of Montreal. A school better built or near as good appearance cannot be seen in these brick buildings. The frame buildings are the equal of any to be found in the city of Montreal. There are four classes. Three of these buildings are within a stone's throw of each other, the first, second, third and the fourth is in the western part of the town. Four hundred and seven children of whom are living on the reservation and the average attendance during the year just ending is 385.\n\nThe department of Indian affairs considers the Indian advance made to such an extent that it has opened up a continuation school for the more advanced students who have graduated young Indian boys and girls in a general business course which includes stenography and shorthand. Upon the completion of their studies they are furnished with a diploma from a Montreal business school. Seven of these students have been successfully passed the Underwood test and will be given the Underwood diploma.\n\nThe pupils in charge of these schools are greatly pleased with their Indian teachers. They say they take great delight in showing visitors through the schools. Visitors are requested to ask the teacher to let a girl step forward and answer any questions that may arise from the years books. That which attracts most attention the most was the discipline displayed by the pupils and also the general appearance of the class rooms and the buildings.\n\nI visited the schools last fall and well, I was told that it was all due to the department of Indian affairs at Ottawa who had been doing so much furnishing teachers with everything that they asked for. No matter what they asked for they always sent them; be it a bunch of pencils or four typewriters, which was the case last winter. Papers, blackboards and desks are all furnished to the children at the expense of the government.\n\nWhat is it that we have so many complaints on our reservations in New York state with regards to equipment? Why can't we have qualified teachers? Is it strange that we look after the education of the handicapped Indians that are cooped up on reservations to the same degree as we do that more children attend school at Caughnawaga in one year than all the schools in New York state except Indian reservations. What kind of diploma does Dr. Hill give the children that ever do graduate out of his fourth grade?\n\nW. B.

The two lowest classes in the end of the village are already filled, and there is not a vacant seat in either of these rooms. No teacher can handle 50 children and teach them properly. The opening of one class is only a very little relief. There are 98 children more in the schools today than there was at this time last year.\n\nI enclose a list of the staff of teachers now on duty. There have been some changes, and two were transferred from the Girls' School to the East end of the Village. All of these teachers are qualified, some in Quebec, others in the United States and all in our own Training school. The Commercial teacher had to be removed on account of ill health. She had pneumonia during the winter, and did not pick up.\nThe present teacher is especially qualified having an Academic Diploma, besides Diplomas for Shorthand Typewriting, Business writing, and a Certificate of Teaching ability provided by the University of Montreal. Her assistant has further more an experience of 25 years in educational work.\n\nI am enclosing a clipping from a New York paper which you will read with interest. It reflects great credit on the management of Indian schools in Quebec.\n\nYou will be pleased to know that every boy and girl who had completed the 6th Form returned to attend the continuation School. We have a fine class of twelve boys and ten girls, all eager to continue their studies, and doing very good work.\n\nThanking you for past kindness,\n\nI am, dear Mr. McKenzie,\n\nYour very cordially,\nSupt. Mary Gabriel\nPrincipal\n\nMr. A. T. McKenzie\nActing Ass't Dept. Secretary\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed Report of my visit to Caughnawaga Village schools yesterday. This is my second visit since the opening of the classes. I beg to point out to the Department that there are much more pupils registered today than the previous years at the same date. All the classes of the young ones are overcrowded, and the Truant Officer, Mr. Jocks, reported yesterday to my Office that some pupils are not attending the school, playing on the streets. We did not force them to go to school, because there is no place for them. It is the reason why I visited all the classes yesterday. There are 98 pupils registered more than last year at the same date. The attendance to the school is certainly remarkable. During the past years, every fall, many families of Indians moved to Lachine for the winter; but no one will move this fall.\n\nThe only way to remediate this overcrowding is the opening\nSir,\n\nof another class for the young\nones of both sexes in the neigh-\nbourhood of Girls' School.\nWill you please give this matter\nyour immediate consideration\nand send me instruction as soon\nas possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M.T.

(RG 10, Volume 6075, file 305-1, part 1A)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI wish to call your attention to the condition of the schools here especially in the East end of the village and to ask you what course it would be best to pursue.\n\nThere are all told 6 classrooms in this section of the village with seating capacity and attendance as follows:\n\n| Class               | Seats | Attendance |\n|---------------------|-------|------------|\n| Continuation Class  | 24    | 25         |\n| 1st Class, Boys' School | 40   | 38         |\n| 2nd \"               | 40    | 40         |\n| 3rd \"               | 44    | 44         |\n| 4th \"               | 48    | 48         |\n| 5th \"               | 44    | 47         |\n\nYou will see that by the present arrangement there are only two seats available in the last class and these are already retained by boys who have been working all summer and who have signified their intention of returning to school and we are short of 3 seats in the 5th. You will moreover notice that these classes are too heavy and that no teacher can successfully handle so many pupils. Twenty-five children, thirty at most, is all any teacher can manage. Additional classrooms is an immediate necessity and I earnestly request you to give this matter your kind attention. Up to the present I have managed with the aid of two Assistant teachers to keep the classes in working order. I have been obliged to give all my time to relieve the teachers overburdened with work. It could be done as long as we had place to accommodate the children but now every seat is filled as you see.\n\nTwo courses are open, the 1st, to refuse any other children; the second, to open another class. With this end in view I have visited two houses where there are rooms large enough to accommodate a class of 30 children. These are available and the proprietors are willing to rent them for $12.50 per month. One a Mr. Snow, the other Mr. John Jacco. Either of these places would be easily fitted up as there would be no repairing to be done, so the expense would be heavy great. If this course is followed I will have to request the Department to send firstly 24 Single seated No 4 desks, together with teacher's desk, portable blackboards. The question of janitor service, salary, heating and lighting could be taken up later. Should the Department prefer to give us the Agent office for a classroom we will also gladly accept this.\n\nTrusting that you may be able to do something without much delay and thanking you for past kindness,\n\nI am, dear Mr. Scott,\n\nYours very cordially,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. D.C.

It is, therefore, impossible to open another class-room at Caughnawaga until next spring. This will necessitate a refusal to admit any other children or a discharge of those under the age limit, to make room for new pupils between the ages of 7 and 15.\n\nWe are preparing the Estimates at this time, and a note will be made in connection with the need for more class-room accommodation on the Caughnawaga reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Q.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nYour letter of recent date stating that early steps would be taken to relieve the congested condition of the schools in Caughnawaga has been received and its contents appreciated.\n\nYour title of Superintendent of Indian Education leads me to expect that you bring to your office vast experience in the line of school work, and I hope you will be able to impress upon those in charge of the Indian Department the absolute necessity of increasing the number of class-rooms here so as to give to each teacher a reasonable number of pupils. Thirty white children are about all any teacher can manage and instruct satisfactorily, when you consider Indian children who do not understand a word the teacher is saying and you increase the difficulty 75%, therefore the number of pupils to each teacher should be proportioned to the difficulty experienced in teaching such pupils. If the Department considers enlarging the schools it would be well to keep this fact in mind.\n\nI trust that some time during the year we will be honored by a visit from you. If you come to this reserve you may be assured of a warm welcome from teachers and pupils.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel\nPrincipal.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nAttention of Mr. Russell T.

Jacobs,\nCaughnawaga, Qu\u00e9.\n\nCher monsieur Jacobs,\n\nPermettez-moi de vous offrir, ainsi qu'\u00e0 Madame Jacobs et \u00e0 toute votre famille, mes remerciements pour les attentions que vous avez eues pour moi, et l'hospitalit\u00e9 que vous m'avez offerte lors de mon passage, ces jours-ci, \u00e0 Caughnawaga.\n\nJ'ai d'autant plus de plaisir \u00e0 vous t\u00e9moigner ma reconnaissance que vous m'avez fourni l'occasion d'\u00e9tudier sur place les conditions actuelles des Indiens de la R\u00e9serve, et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, le magnifique essor qui est maintenant donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'instruction de leurs enfants.\n\nC'est avec une admiration profonde, et que vous avez remarqu\u00e9e sans doute, que j'ai visit\u00e9 les demeures d'un bon nombre de vos familles, y compris la v\u00f4tre, et que j'y ai trouv\u00e9 le cachet \u00e9loquent de la propret\u00e9, de l'aisance et de la distinction. Il m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e9galement de constater la condition des gens moins fortun\u00e9s, et de trouver chez eux, dans l'en-\nMonsieur J.M. Jacobs,\n\nsemble, des moeurs paisibles et le respect de l'autorit\u00e9, avec beaucoup de sympathie pour l'\u00e9tranger qui passe chez eux.\n\nMais, ce qui m'a frapp\u00e9 pardessus tout, c'est le d\u00e9veloppement de l'\u00e9ducation. J'ai visit\u00e9 dans la R\u00e9serve, au jour m\u00eame de l'ouverture des classes, quatre \u00e9coles o\u00f9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 au-del\u00e0 de trois cent cinquante enfants se sont inscrits. La tenue de ces \u00e9coles, confi\u00e9e aux R\u00e9v\u00e9rendes Soeurs de la communaut\u00e9 de Ste-Anne, m'a parue parfaite, et les \u00e9l\u00e8ves y sont pourvus g\u00e9n\u00e9reusement, aux frais du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, de tout ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 leur instruction. Ces enfants sont r\u00e9ellement favoris\u00e9s, et, vous le dirais-je, \u00e0 les voir si bien install\u00e9s, ils feraient envie aux enfants qui fr\u00e9quentent la majorit\u00e9 des \u00e9coles de nos campagnes. Au reste, les petits Indiens m'ont paru bien r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l'attention qu'on a pour eux. Ils sont tous tr\u00e8s propres, se pr\u00e9sentent bien, et j'ai constat\u00e9 moi-m\u00eame qu'ils sont tr\u00e8s avanc\u00e9s dans les \u00e9tudes qu'on leur fait poursuivre. On y a d\u00e9cern\u00e9, l'an dernier, de nombreux dipl\u00f4mes, et il m'a fait plaisir d'y voir une \u00e9cole d'enseignement commercial avanc\u00e9e, o\u00f9 les jeunes gens peuvent se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 remplir des positions lucratives dans les affaires. J'ai aussi appris que plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e8ves sortaient de vos \u00e9coles pour entrer dans les coll\u00e8ges classiques.\nMonsieur J.M. Jacobs,\n\nTout cela, sans doute, est d\u00fb \u00e0 la bonne volont\u00e9 de votre population qui a compris l'importance de l'instruction, mais il faut en rendre \u00e9galement hommage \u00e0 l'autorit\u00e9 religieuse et au gouvernement qui s'int\u00e9ressent si profond\u00e9ment au sort des Indiens, et particuli\u00e8rement aux bonnes religieuses qui exercent l\u00e0 un apostolat vraiment \u00e9difiant. Je me permets aussi de f\u00e9liciter tous les esprits clairvoyants qui, avec vous, dans la R\u00e9serve, ont, ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, appuy\u00e9 tous les mouvements g\u00e9n\u00e9reux en faveur de l'avancement de leurs cong\u00e9n\u00e8res. Ce que j'ai vu dans les \u00e9coles m'a fait concevoir de grandes esp\u00e9rances pour l'avenir des Iroquois de Caughnawaga : l'instruction si largement r\u00e9pandue chez eux depuis quelques ann\u00e9es, fera de leurs descendants, dans un avenir rapproch\u00e9, un peuple sain et fort, uni aux autres Canadiens et capable de rivaliser avec eux dans tous les domaines de l'activit\u00e9 sociale.\n\nJe vous renouvelle, cher monsieur Jacobs, \u00e0 vous et \u00e0 votre famille, mes meilleurs remerciements pour l'objet d\u00e9licat d'art indien que vous m'avez offert \u00e0 l'occasion de mon passage chez vous.\n\nVotre bien d\u00e9vou\u00e9,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGM/AH\nMontreal, Sept. 12th, 1921.\n\nMr. J. M. Jacobs,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nDear Mr. Jacobs,\n\nAllow me to offer you, as well as Mrs. Jacobs, and all your family, my thanks for the kind attention you have had for me and for the hospitality which was extended to me during my stay a few days ago at Caughnawaga. It is ever so great a pleasure to express my thankfulness that you have furnished me with an occasion to study on the spot the present conditions of the Indians on the Reserve, and more particularly the splendid impulse which is now given to the education of their children.\n\nIt is with deep admiration which you have noticed, surely, that I have visited the dwellings of a good number of Indian families, as well as yours, and I found in them cleanliness, ease and distinction. I also had the opportunity to become acquainted with those who are less fortunate and to find ease with them, generally, peaceful manners and respect of authority, together with a great deal of sympathy for the strangers visiting them.\n\nBut, what struck me above all, is the development of education. I visited the reserve on the day of the opening of the classes at the four schools where already more than 250 children were registered. The keeping of these schools which is entrusted to the reverend sisters of the Community of St. Ann's, appeared to me to be perfect and the pupils are generously provided at the expense of the Federal Government of everything necessary for their education.\n\nThese children are really favourite and should I tell you that, when seeing them so well provided, their good fortune would be envied by children attending the majority of our country schools. However, the young Indians have appeared\nto respond to the kindness extended to them. They are very clean; they stand well, and I found for myself that they were quite advanced in the studies which they are following.\n\nSeveral diplomas have been awarded last year, and I was greatly pleased to see there, a school of advanced commercial studies where the young people can prepare themselves to fill good business positions. I also learned that many of the pupils were leaving your schools to enter into classic colleges.\n\nAll this is obviously due to the good will of your population who have understood the importance of education, but we must also render homage to the religious authorities and to the Government who are so deeply interested in the welfare of the Indians and more particularly to the reverend sisters who are exercising there, an apostleship truly edifying.\n\nI also take liberty to congratulate all the far-seeing minds who with you, on this reserve, have in the later years, helped the generous movements in favour of the advancement of their fellow citizens. What I saw in the schools has given me great hopes for the future of the Iroquois of Caughnawaga. Education which has been so largely spread amongst them in the last few years should make of their descendents, in the near future, a sane and strong people united to the other Canadians, and able to rivalise with them in all the activities of social domains.\n\nI wish to renew, dear Mr. Jacobs, to you and to your family, my best thanks for the delicate object of Indian Art which you have kindly offered me during my visit with you.\n\nYours devotedly,\n\n(SGD) Gustave Monette,\n(Lawyer)\nOttawa, December 10th, 1921.\n\nMr. Ferrier,\n\nMr. Jacobs of Caughnawaga has sent me the attached letter which has been addressed to him by a lawyer of Montreal. I am referring it to you as I thought it might interest you to know about the school conditions on the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartmental Engineer.\nRespected Sir:\n\nWe are very happy indeed to be able to offer you our Christmas greetings and at the same time give you a sample of the work we are doing in our school.\n\nIt will give you pleasure to know that we love our school very much, and that we are all working hard to give satisfaction to our devoted teachers. We appreciate to the fullest the wonderful advantages that are afforded us here now, and we know too, that it is chiefly through your kindness and forethought that such exceptional opportunities are given us.\n\nAllow us then to extend to you and to those near to you our best wishes for a Merry Christmas, coupled with our sincere thanks for all you are doing for our school. We hope to be an honor to our school and the pride of those who are tutoring us.\n\nYour respectful words,\n\nThe children of the Continuation School\n\nPer [Signature]\n\nMr. D.G.

My hope is that you will continue your studies until you are quite proficient to take positions in the commercial life of our country, and that you will then prove a credit not only to your tutors but also to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nI hope that you will all enjoy a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMaster Paul Kelly,\nCaughnawaga Continuation School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nSir,\n\nEnclosed the \"Lacerte School Return for the quarter ending Dec 31st. I beg to draw the attention of the Department on the good attendance of the pupils. During this quarter of 57 school days, 174 pupils were not absent one single day, 35 were absent one day, and 26 two days.\n\nDuring the quarter 13 children left for Spanish or other schools; 19 left for Lachine or other places to return in the spring. These children are probably not going to any school.\n\n5 children left the village schools for Bush School; 6 left school being over 15; 6 children do not attend school because they are not properly clad.\n\n25 children were out of school at different times for a considerable time on account of illness.

I will be pleased if you will report concerning each of these cases, and state the cost in each case of supplying a few articles of clothing to enable these children to attend. As soon as this information is received, you will be further advised as to what should be done in having the clothing required supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. M. Brosseau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nIt gives me pleasure to tell you that our schools re-opened on January 9th with a large attendance. A few children have moved away for the winter but on the whole the classes are well filled and all of the children seemed disposed to work.\n\nAs previously stated we had not a pencil on hand for the opening of school. I was, therefore, obliged to send a messenger to Lacolle to get two boxes of pencils to get the children started. On Wednesday the 11th, the supply came in from the department. I was greatly disappointed to receive in spite of my repeated protests a very inferior grade of pencils called \"Seconds\" No 504. These pencils are a real nuisance, they break away every few minutes and the children are running from the sharpener to their desks. The teachers are so annoyed at this continual disturbance that they have urged the children to buy their own pencils. There are no erasers on these pencils either and then comes the further trouble of providing erasers which are often lost, misplaced or otherwise done away with. I really do not see why the Stationery Department buys such poor pencils and expect teachers to put up with this annoyance. In the course of a Dietitian's schedule to forty pupils surely you have to stop or the teacher has to wait until the pencil is resharpended. You cannot imagine the loss of valuable time occasioned thereby.\n\nTrusting that you will do what lies in your power to prevent a repetition of this,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very cordially,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, January 18th, 1922.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn the absence of the Superintendent of Indian Education, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant regarding the grade of lead pencils supplied for the use of the Caughnawaga schools.\n\nIn this connection, I beg to say it is regretted that an inferior grade of pencil was forwarded, and also that annoyance is caused in the classroom by the use of these pencils.\n\nWe are forwarding a copy of your letter to the Superintendent of Stationery, with the request that, in future, he will see that a good grade of lead pencil is supplied to Indian schools. The Department desires that all school supplies will be of a serviceable quality, and it is hoped that in future there will be no cause for complaint regarding the supplies received.\n\nWe are pleased to note that there was such a large and regular attendance upon the re-opening of the schools after the Christmas holidays.\n\nThe matters referred to in your letter of the 15th, regarding a visit by the Superintendent to Caughnawaga, will be brought to his attention upon his return and you will, no doubt, hear from him in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The expenditure incurred should not exceed your estimate of approximately $28.00.\n\nProperly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded, which should show the items of clothing, and the cost of same, furnished in each case.\n\nI will be pleased if you will give this matter your early attention in order that these children will not be kept away from school for lack of clothing.\n\nIt is noted that you will report later regarding the clothing needed by the Benedict children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I wish to thank you sincerely for sending us this material which will be very useful and which we will turn to the very best account.\n\nSome time ago you stated that you expected to visit the Caughnawaga Reserve during the course of the winter, and as I am obliged to leave for one week or ten days either during February or March I would certainly not wish to be absent while you would be here. If you have any idea of the time of the year you could visit us I would be better able to plan how I can get away. If you would allow me to suggest I consider May the best time to judge of conditions here and see them as they really are. It could be very satisfactory if you could make your visit coincide with that of the Inspector, Mr. Gilman, it would afford you an opportunity of meeting this man and discussing the questions relating to the schools right here in the grounds.\n\nAs I pointed out previously some steps will have to be taken without further delay to relieve the school conditions here, and unless some one in authority comes here and sees things, and above all understands school work I fear little will be done.\n\nThanking you once more for your kindness,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very cordially,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T.

I, of course, wish to be at the Caughnawaga reserve when you are in charge, and will make sure that you are not on a holiday before I consider my trip to that point.\n\nAs far as I am aware at present, the month of May would be satisfactory to me, and if you could intimate the exact date of the inspection of Mr. Gilman, I can probably arrange to meet him at Caughnawaga.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

As soon as I have an answer I shall write you immediately.\n\nI have now fully decided to make my annual retreat from March 15th to 24th. Every year the Principals of our Order are called together to attend lectures bearing on their duties and especially on their functions in directing schools. It is by no means a holiday for me, but a duty which I must perform. I pointed out to Mr. Gilman that April was badly cut up with Easter coming on the 16th. The week before is somewhat disturbed and the week after is the Spring vacation, so all taken into consideration either the last week of April or the first weeks of May are the best time to inspect the schools.\n\nI am sorry to say that we have had a great deal of sickness among the younger children these last weeks, cold, grippe, sore throat has been the cause. The cold last week was intense but the schools were well heated, and our Residence is also most comfortable, so the teachers have not suffered.\n\nI would request you to authorize me to have a repair man come from Montreal to look over our typewriters. Several of them need minor repairs after five months of constant use with twenty-seven pupils taking daily practice.\n\nThanking you for past kindness,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T.

I regret to learn that there has been considerable sickness among the pupils, and I trust that it will not be long before all are restored to good health.\n\nIn answer to your request for attention to the typewriters of the school, you are authorized to arrange for the services of a repair man from Montreal to attend to them. The expense in this connection should be kept down to the lowest possible amount, and, when the accounts are received, they should be handed by you to Mr. Agent Brosseau, who will certify them and send them to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

We noticed it early Saturday morning and notified the policeman who started an investigation to find the machine. We promised a reward to anyone giving information leading to the discovery of the thieves. There are no typewriters in Caughnawaga except three and the presence of a machine in the village would naturally cause suspicion. My object in writing you today is to find out if the Stationery Department kept a record of the Serial numbers of the Underwood machines shipped to this school early in July 1921 from the D.S.C.R. The number would help us to find the machine if it was sold to a second hand store in Lachine or Montreal.\n\nTrusting that you may be able to help us in this matter,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T.

Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI am writing you today to inquire if the Department would allow me to introduce a little Algebra in the Continuation School for the benefit of the boys who intend going to High School next year. We were authorized to teach the Commercial Subjects and so far, have adhered to this exclusively; but our boys know their Arithmetic fairly well, they have a good working knowledge of Bookkeeping, and are doing quite well at stenography and typewriting. Some of them are most anxious to get a start in subjects that will benefit them in Classical High School work. I thought I might win two weeks a week to the subject and leave the other three to the completion of the Arithmetic and Book-keeping, but I would not undertake this without your approval.\n\nIf you sanction my little plan, would you authorize me to purchase one dozen Algebras immediately. It takes so very long to get things through the Stationery office and as this is such a small amount, I thought you might obtain this little concession for me.\n\nWe have heard nothing further about the missing typewriter. It is somewhat consoling to know that it was the poorest machine we had. The frame was somewhat shattered and the type would never appear clear on this account, yet we used it and miss it very much.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell F. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 16, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 13th instant, I beg to state that the Department will be very pleased to allow you to introduce the teaching of Algebra in the Continuation School, to those pupils who intend going to High School next year.\n\nWe have four copies in stock of Hall & Knight's Junior Algebra, which are being sent under separate cover. These will enable you to carry on until the supply of Elementary Algebras by Hall & Knight, the text-book prescribed for the province of Quebec, and which are being ordered through the Government Stationery Office, can arrive. It is necessary that all text-books be ordered through the Stationery Office here.\n\nIt is regretted that you have been unable to find any trace of the typewriter which was stolen. It is hoped that, later on, by patient enquiry by yourself and others, some trace may be obtained of the machine and the person who committed the theft.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal, Caughnawaga Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nAs to the family, Benedict, mentioned in your letter of the 20th and mine of the 14th of January, last, I beg to say that there are 3 children of school age - one boy 12 years, a girl 11 and another boy 8. They have absolutely no clothing and need to be fitted up completely. They have no shoes or other clothing and have been kept in the house all winter. The boy, aged 12, attended school a few weeks in June and September. He is absolutely illiterate, can hardly pick a few simple words. The girl, 11, went to school a few weeks in June and knows nothing. The other boy never attended school.\n\nThe boys should need overcoats, caps, mitts, shoes, rubbers, stockings, underwear and a suit of clothes or pants and sweaters. The girl would need cloak, dress, underwear, shoes, stockings, mitts, rubbers, cap, etc. I should judge that it will not be possible to clothe these children for less than $25.00 each, and I really do not know if I could get them fitted out for that amount. I will wait for your instructions.\n\n\"J.M. Brosseau\".\nOTTAWA, February 21st, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 13th instant which refers to the clothing required for the Benedict children, and stating the various articles of the same required by each of these three children, I have to request that you will be good enough to state whether, if all or any part of this clothing is furnished, these children will attend school regularly. You should also state which school on the Caughnawaga Reserve they would attend.\n\nI may say that our funds for the purpose of supplying clothing, etc., to Indian children is limited, and unless we receive an assurance that these children would attend school regularly, if the clothing is supplied, we could not furnish the same. You should obtain an assurance from the parents that they will see, if clothing is supplied, that the children attend regularly and, as soon as we have this assurance, we will then decide the amount of clothing that will be provided and the expenditure that can be incurred.\n\nYou might also state whether the four children to whom you recently furnished clothing are attending school regularly.\n\nYour early reply to this letter will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. M. Brossard, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 8th instant with regard to the theft of a typewriter at Caughnawaga school, I beg to state that I gave order to the constable Jocks to overlook any pawn shop at Lachine. He has the No. of the machine stolen; he made 2 visits to Lachine when he had been informed that there was typewriter for sale, and each time, he found a Remington instead of an Underwood. You may rely on Mr. Jocks for his personal attention and mine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M.B. Brosseau\nIndian Agent\n\nD. Mclean, Esq.\nAsst. Secretary & Sec.\nOttawa\nMy dear Mr. Perrier,\n\nI am grateful for the prompt reply to my letter and for your kindness in sending the Algebras which I expect to receive soon. I have had some experience with the Stationery Department in the past when books I asked for in January reached us late in June. This was my reason for asking to purchase the books here so that we could get right on with the work, but if you take up the matter with the Stationery Office they will probably give it more attention. \"Hall and Knight\" is just the author I would wish for.\n\nOur policeman is now following up a clue which I hope may lead to the recovery of the stolen typewriter.\n\nI am pleased to inform you and all the other officials of the Department who may be especially interested in Couchiching that after many repeated efforts I have succeeded in getting a telephone placed in our Residence. The Company will install a private pay station here which will cost nothing to the Department nor to us. We will have to pay only for the calls. It will be a wonderful convenience and time saver. Whenever the Department desires to communicate with the Officials here, the privacy our house affords will be a great advantage. As soon as the installation is completed I shall send the name and number of the telephone to the Department.\n\nOn Saturday I brought eleven of our children to Montreal to have their eyes tested. After many repeated efforts I succeeded in getting the parents to provide glasses for their children. Through the influence of personal friend at St. Luke's Hospital they were all examined free of charge by a Specialist. All were in a wretched condition and will need treatment which we will give them here before and after school hours. This is only a beginning in the right direction and I hope other parents will realize the necessity of looking after their children's eyesight. Many are backward in their work on this account.\n\nWith renewed thanks,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T. Perrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI have just handed in the quarterly reports of the schools to Mr. Agent Brossard and they will be referred to you in due time.\n\nYou will notice that in spite of the bad weather conditions, illness, insufficient clothing and other hindrances the schools have been well filled this quarter. Forty-seven pupils more were registered during the March 1922 quarter than were enrolled in March 1921. The average attendance also increased from 236 in March 1921 to 286 in March 1922.\n\nWith the coming of spring, the fine weather and good roads many more children will return, and I am really worried to know how to accommodate them. The teachers are already overtaxed and were it not for the help given by Assistant teachers in some of the class rooms we could not make much headway. We employ two; one to assist in the 4th Class Boys' and Girls' School where 50 children are registered and another who divides her time between the boys and girls school where I think her help most needed. She assists with the backward children and thus relieves the teachers. These young girls help greatly and as they have no employment they are glad to work for a small salary.\n\nEarly in the fall of 1921 you told me the Department would open a new class this spring. While this is almost imperative we would not easily find a suitable place and it would cost so much to get it fitted up. If the Department intends building I would suggest that instead of opening a new school this spring, I be authorized to employ a third Assistant for the Primary Girls School, and as the room is large I can place quite a few more desks there and thus carry on the work until the end of this school year. This will save the Department quite an outlay, and perhaps the results will be as satisfactory.\nI would call your attention to one family here named Benedict. We are four children of school age and none have attended this year but one for a few months in the early fall. They are in absolute need of help. The father is in the hospital and there is not a cent of revenue in the house. I have given them all the assistance I could in the line of food and clothing, but it seems to me the Department should investigate the matter. I have called the attention of the Agent to these people, and he tells me he has tried in vain to get the children fitted up to come to school. If you can possibly do anything for them it would be a great charity.\n\nI wish to state here in reference to one of your suggestions that we refuse all children under school age, that according to the Indian Regulations I have, the age is from 6 to 15 and I accept children at six. Occasionally I have been obliged to take in a few below that age, but very seldom. It is very hard to refuse or send away children here because the people immediately think you are discriminating against them, and they consequently cause trouble, and if you have any idea of how much trouble such a little thing will cause you will easily understand my attitude.\n\nWe are all looking forward to your visit, and when we shall meet and see things as they really are it will be easier to discuss ways and means of improvement. I hope you will have sufficient time at your disposal to make a thorough and complete investigation of the Gaughnawaga Reserve Schools.\n\nI am pleased to state that we now have a long distance telephone with local office at Lachine. The number is 812 - Ring 4. Any time the Department wishes to send a hurried message to Gaughnawaga we will be happy to deliver it.\n\nTrusting that you will find the reports etc. satisfactory in every detail,\n\nI am, dear Sir\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell Perrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6075, file 305-1, part 1A)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, regarding the attendance at the schools under your charge on the Caughnawaga Reserve, and drawing attention to the need of more classroom accommodation in order to provide for the increasing number of Indian children who will be likely to attend when the weather and roads improve.\n\nIt is doubtful whether we will have funds to provide extra classroom accommodation this year, and, therefore, your suggestion to employ a third assistant for the primary girls' school is approved. You may engage the services of a teacher who is qualified for the purpose, and the Department will allow her a salary at the same rate as is paid each of the other two assistant teachers. This arrangement is for the balance of the present school year only. It is hoped that, with this arrangement, you will be able to carry on the teaching and provide for all the extra children who may attend during the next few months.\n\nIt is noted that you are refusing all children under school age, except in a few exceptional cases.\n\nYour new telephone number has been noted and, no doubt, this will be found very useful in communicating with Caughnawaga.\n\nI am looking forward to my visit to Caughnawaga early in May, and will then take the opportunity to discuss various school matters with you.\n\nYou will be further advised regarding the Benedict family who are in urgent need of assistance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

One continuation school is being conducted at Caughnawaga, stenography and typewriting are taught by the Sisters.\n\nSalaries.\u2014The salaries have increased during the year from $450. to $500. on the average for qualified teachers. Some teachers received from $650. to $750. and one elementary teacher received $1,000. for ten months.\n\nConsolidation is not making much progress in my district of inspection. One new school was opened at St. Bernard during the year.\n\nConferences were held as usual, in the month of September, practically all of the teachers attended one or more of the meetings.\n\nEducational Campaign meetings were held under the direction of the Protestant Committee at Huntingdon and Howiek.\n\nBoth meetings were poorly attended by men.\n\nThis report, together with the summary of Statistics, bulletins and special reports previously forwarded to your department, is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honour, etc.,\n\nA.

Luther Gilman, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nCowansville, Que.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to thank you for your prompt and kind reply to my letter of April 2nd, and to tell you that I am extremely grateful.\n\nOur school will reopen on April 1st, as the Teachers' Federation has decided to close a week earlier than usual. We had no choice but to follow their lead, as we always try to cooperate with them. The Department has always approved this because it is quite hard to keep the children in school the last week of June when the lure of strawberries, fishing, etc., takes them away from their studies. Another reason is that the \"smash\" Gulf Stream is in full swing during June and our boys get so excited at the thought of getting them to school. At this time there is nothing to worry about and we feel it is beneficial to the children to have them in school.\n\nI am pleased to tell you that one of our pupils following the Commercial Department of the school has obtained a position as stenographer and typist in a large lumber firm. He would be very pleased helping me to complete a course but the firm demands a little more work and he has $300 a week to start. He wrote 92 words per minute in shorthand and about 45 words per minute on the typewriter.\n\nI regret to state however, that our best pupil in the Commercial Class was stricken with typhoid fever a few weeks ago and will be quite a long time out of school.\n\nNow that the spring is at hand I trust you will soon come here again for your well-earned visit to see the school. We are looking forward to your coming with much pleasure.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipals\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\"I would call your attention to one family here named Benedict.

Q.\nOttawa, May 12, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to inform you that, at the request of the Indian Council, I attended their meeting the evening of the 9th instant, for the purpose of discussing school matters with the Council and the Band of the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nAmong the many subjects that came up for consideration was the crowded condition of the classrooms; and the Council intimated that they believed there were more white children in attendance than I learned during my inspection. They asked that arrangements be made for an official visit of a member, or members, of the Council to the schools, with a view to making a survey of the children in attendance. Knowing your willingness to receive the Mayor and members of the Council, I assured them that I would write to you in this connection.\n\nThe Council may visit you during the next week, and you should assist them in any way you can to arrive at the facts of which they are in search. The whole Band evinced an interest in school matters, and I believe no harm can come out of this action. It will be quite in order for you to open the registers in the various classrooms and give them any information you have concerning the pupils.\n\nI trust that no inconvenience will be felt by you or the Sisters in your excellent work.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Mr. Agent Brosseau, for his information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. Sister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal, Caughnawaga Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge yours of the 18th ultimo, referring to the conditions of the play-ground at the St. Regis village Indian day school. I have noted you remarked concerning the need for 200 cubic yards of gravel and a system of drainage.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the department engineer Mr. Chene, has been instructed to visit your Reserve at his earliest convenience. He will prepare a memorandum concerning the work to be done. Tenders will be invited and a contract let.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Education.\n\nMr. F. E. Taillon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\n\nCharlotte Williams.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose, at your request, samples of the letter you dictated to the Stenography class on May 8th. Not any of them are absolutely perfect, but I send them just as they handed them in to the teacher the following day. They received no help whatever from anybody.\n\nI delayed forwarding these because I was busy with the Inspector, and it is only today that I could look over the papers myself and select them.\n\nI wish to say that all the teachers have kept of your visit a most pleasing remembrance and we will look forward to your coming again whenever an opportunity presents itself. I should request you, when you have time, to send me a written report of your visit here, bearing on methods used, discipline, supervision, conditions existing at the time, etc. Any suggestion for improvement in the methods of teaching will be heartily appreciated and we shall endeavor to follow your directions most faithfully.\n\nI realize that perhaps you found it a little annoying to be forced to listen to a welcome song, etc., but realizing that this was your first visit we tried to impress on the children the importance of the position you hold and a greeting seemed to be the most appropriate way of showing you their appreciation. At any subsequent visit you will be freed from any such detail.\n\nYour Report will be kept on file in the school thus showing from year to year what improvement we have been able to make.\n\nThanking you for your kindness,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 20, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have yours of the 12th instant, enclosing examples of the work done by the Commercial Class on the occasion of my visit. I have examined these results, and I believe that the letter prepared by Charlotte Williams is the best and that Margaret Snow should have honorable mention. On another file, I am increasing the amount for the annual prizes at Caughnawaga, and you might be able to pay some slight recognition to the efficiency of these girls.\n\nConcerning a written report on my visit on the 8th and 9th instant, I beg to state I am not able to comment either favourably, or unfavourably, on pedagogy. The few hours and the many classrooms and teachers make this impossible. Next week I will prepare extracts from my report to the Deputy Superintendent General, and this will have to constitute the record of my visit. You will understand that I would not be fair to myself or to the teachers if I tried to criticize their work when I have only had a few minutes in each classroom.\n\nHowever, I am prepared to go on record that you and the Sisters are to be congratulated upon the excellent results that you have obtained. Your pupils are bright and show enough initiative to give conclusive proof of careful instruction and excellent supervision. As I state in my report to Mr. Scott, on the whole in Caughnawaga the Sisters are doing the best work that I have seen in any Indian day schools in the Dominion.\n\nI am grateful for your assurance that, upon the occasion of my next visit, I will be freed from the formal welcome. I believe that I see the merit, from the pupils' standpoint, in such activity, or I would never be able to enjoy it at all.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal, Caughnawaga Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nI wish to report on my visit to the Caughnawaga Reserve, on the 8th and 9th instant. I found in the village schools a total of 425 pupils enrolled and in attendance 331. The classrooms are crowded, but the buildings are in good condition. The Sister Superior and the Sisters are to be congratulated upon the excellent results that they have obtained. The pupils are bright, clean and are on the whole doing the best work that I have seen in any Indian day schools in Canada.\n\nBoys' School.\n\nThere are 172 boys enrolled in the regular classes held in the main building and in the little frame building to the south. Grades 1 to 5 are in these buildings and, although crowded, are doing excellent work.\n\nThere is but 1\u00bd acres of school lot in connection with the Boys' School, and I would strongly recommend that the property be graded, filled and drained, so as to provide proper playground facilities. In addition, a chicken netting should be placed along one side for about 30 yards to provide a back-stop for balls which are continually flying over into the neighboring garden.\n\nContinuation Class:\n\nThe Continuation Class, doing commercial work, is situated in the Boys' School building. The typewriting is done on the second floor of the little frame structure to the south, and shorthand and other subjects are taught in the main building. This feature of the Caughnawaga school system is unique in Canada, for I believe that no Indian school elsewhere is teaching commercial work. There are 27 boys and girls enrolled in this special class.\n\nGirls' School\n\nIn the Girls' School there are classes from the primary grade to grade 6, 2 of them being held in the assembly hall. The seating accommodation is hardly adequate for the large enrolment. The teachers, without exception, are doing excellent work and the pupils are bright and clean and show considerable initiative.\nThe school lot at the Girls' School should be levelled and drained as soon as possible, to provide proper playground facilities for the 176 girls enrolled. I have authorized a minor repair to the furnace and, over Mr. McLean's signature, the Departmental Engineer, Mr. Chene, was instructed to arrange for a larger water supply pipe from the Mission House under the road to the school. This road was about to be macadamized and the work had to be undertaken immediately.\n\nBoys' and Girls' School.\n\nThe building formerly used by the Methodist Church for educational purposes is occupied by 48 primary boys and girls. They show evidence of excellent instruction and will make rapid progress under the tuition of the Sisters. The grounds here are very small and not fit for playground purposes. This school building should be no longer used for educational purposes when more accommodation is provided in a large building elsewhere.\n\nTeachers' Residence.\n\nThe teachers' residence is quite adequate for the purpose of housing the 14 Sisters doing the work among the Indian children at Caughnawaga. You will remember that the Department built an addition on the rear of a building for which we hold a 5 year lease. I learned that we hold an option on this front portion for $2,000 and, if this is considered a good purchase by the Departmental Architect, it should without question be taken over, in view of the improvements that we have made. If we purchase the front portion of the building or if we are committed to such action, the outside wall should be given a coat of marine paint and the roof of the barn should receive some repairs.\n\nJanitors\n\nI found that the Sisters and the Agent were quite pleased with the services rendered by the 2 Janitors, Messrs. Vieux and Zacharie. In the case of the last named employee, I would recommend that his salary be increased from $250 to $300 per annum, in view of his faithful and excellent services.\n\nTruant Officer\n\nThe most energetic and businesslike employee of the Department on the Caughnawaga Reserve is John K. Jocks, Constable and Truant Officer. Every child absent from school is checked up immediately, and this officer is putting all his time on departmental work. He receives, as Constable, $60 a year and, as Truant Officer, $200. In view of the excellent results that he has shown, I would recommend that his salary as Truant Officer be increased by $100.\nCongested Classrooms.\n\nThe buildings in use for school purposes on the Caughnawaga Reserve are adequate for all the Indian wards between the ages of 7 and 15 years. 3 factors combine to keep the schools crowded - first, the untiring energies of the Truant Officer - second, the enrolment of 20 five-year-old and 53 six-year-old pupils. In view of the splendid results with which the Sisters are meeting in the primary grades, I hesitate to recommend that these younger children be discharged from the schools. The Department has permitted, for some time, those of 6 years to attend. The 20 five-year-olds have been carefully selected by the Sister Superior from the many applicants for admission at this age. The five-year-olds at school have lost either one or two of their parents or come from homes where they are receiving absolutely no oversight.\n\nThe third factor in connection with the crowded classrooms is the presence of French children who are not wards of the Government. As I visited the classrooms, I made a survey of those in this category and, with the help of the Agent, Truant Officer, Priest and Sister Superior, found 20 white children in attendance. The Indian Council, when I met them on the evening of the 9th, assured me that there were many more than this number attending the Indian schools. I informed the Council that the Department had more or less a moral obligation to those whom we permitted to lease reserve lands in connection with the education of their children.\n\nThe great need at Caughnawaga is another building with 6 classrooms and an auditorium. One room could be used for the Grade 6 boys and girls, one room each for primary boys and girls and two rooms for the commercial class. The third floor could be used as an auditorium. This building should be placed on a site with adequate playground facilities.\n\nMeeting with Council and Band.\n\nAt the request of the members of the Council, I attended an unofficial council meeting at which 150 members of the Band were present, on the evening of the 9th instant. I reported on my inspection of the schools and congratulated the Band on the excellent progress that was being made and on the evident interest of the parents.\n\nIn answer to a request that the boys of the village be taught by lay teachers - preferably men - I informed the Council that the Department has absolute confidence in the Sisters and that I could take no recommendation to Ottawa regarding a change.\n\nThe most important matter broached by the Council was the large number of French children attending the schools and overcrowding the classrooms. I explained that the Department had a moral obligation to those whom we permitted to lease land on the reserve; and that, when visiting the school, I had counted only 25 who were not wards of the Department. The Indians felt that there were more than this number in attendance and they asked permission to visit the schools in an effort to verify their statements.\nstatements. In the light of the Sister Superior's expressed willingness to allow the members of the Council to come into the schools and get acquainted with the work, I promised the Council that I would strongly recommend that they be given permission to visit.\n\nThe members of the Council strongly urged the opening of a night class in technical education for the older boys of the village. They requested that particular emphasis be placed on the reading of blue prints and other studies related to structural work. I promised to give this matter earnest consideration and suggested that they cast about for a suitable man - preferably in Caughnawaga - who was qualified to give such instruction.\n\nThe Council claimed to be strongly interested in the education of the children of the Band and asked that a School Board be appointed. I informed them that the powers of such a Board would naturally be limited, because the entire expense was being met by the Vote for Indian Education. I intimated that it might be possible, if the parents of the children were interested enough, to arrange for a School Board with the powers of visitation and recommendation. The Council asked me to draft regulations covering the duties and functions of such a School Board.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Que., May 23, 1922.\n\nDear Sir,\n\n- Replying to your communication of May 20th; No.5-1-1, I wish to thank you for the honorable mention you give to Charlotte Williams and Margaret Snow for the work submitted by them on the occasion of your visit. I shall certainly give recognition to this fact publicly at the Closing Exercises of the School.\n\nI will be quite satisfied with the Extract from your Report to the Superintendent General concerning the Caughnawaga Schools. My object is to keep this in the files of the School. In years to come these Reports from Official visitors will be of great interest indeed.\n\nThanking you once again,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 29, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to enclose extracts from my recent report, on the Caughnawaga Indian schools, to the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nAs you are aware, it is not at all complete, and no effort is made to comment on methods and individual teachers. The report is rather my impressions concerning the nature of the work and the needs of the organization as a whole.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of May 12th, No.5-1-1, I would say that the Members of the Council will be most welcome to visit the school at any time they may think fit to do so, and all information will be gladly given them, but I am quite sure that none of them will turn up. I shall invite them all to attend our School Closing Exercises which will take up the best part of the week ending June 23rd, as our reception hall is so small that we can admit but two classes at a time.\n\nThere are here two groups of Indians, bitterly opposed one to the other. It is sufficient for one group to approve a measure for the other to disapprove it for no other reason very often than to stir up a little commotion. As a consequence, there are living here families whom one group recognize as Indians, but the others claim them to be white. One group is opposed to Government control and want to return to olden traditions, the other wants improvements and generally show satisfaction at what the Department decides. One group approves the church and sustains the Missionary, the other criticizes everything that is done. One group approves the schools, admires the work of the teachers, the other condemns wholesale everything that is being done. I have tried to follow the middle course and favor neither one nor the other. The younger people show a different spirit, and are not so antagonistic. I am in hopes that time will better these conditions, and education will do a great deal towards broadening the minds of the Indians.\n\nOnce again assuring you that should the Gentlemen of the Council present themselves, we will give them a warm welcome.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nMr. Agent Brossard called here a few days ago to inquire about the ability, character, etc., of young Joseph Beaudoin whose mother had solicited aid from the Department to allow her boy to finish school. I gave the desired information to the Agent, but in the interest of the boy and the Department as well, I thought of writing you in this regard.\n\nYoung Beaudoin is a very good boy, diligent, painstaking, gentlemanly and reliable. He is one of the best boys we have in the school. He speaks French and English quite well and is able to write stenography at 100 words per minute while at the typewriter he is quite efficient. As this boy is a ward of the Government, and that his Mother is depending on him for support do you not think he could obtain a position in some one of other of the Federal Offices in Montreal. There are many postoffices, railroad offices, etc., where such a boy could be of very valuable help and where he might work himself up into a higher position. There is nothing about him to reveal his origin. He does not look like an Indian and his name is distinctly French-Canadian. If you could do something toward recommending him whenever a vacancy occurs and there will be many during the holidays, I am sure you would have no cause to regret it. He is not a very strong boy, and it would be a pity to turn him to rough labor. Hoping you may be able to help this boy.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention of Mr. A.F. McKenzie.\nJune 16, 1922.\n\nDear Madam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, in reference to Joseph Beauvais.\n\nAll appointments to the Civil Service are now made by the Civil Service Commission and I would suggest that Mr. Beauvais write to Mr. Wm. Foran, Secretary of the Civil Service Commission, and ask him for particulars concerning the examinations for the outside service, having reference particularly to the Post Office Department. It will be necessary for him to pass an examination, the details of which he will obtain by thus applying.\n\nI do not know that the Department could be of particular service in obtaining a position for him in a railway office. If, however, we knew of a vacancy, I should be glad to write to someone in authority on the boy's behalf.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Sister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nSummary\n\n|                | Roll | Ave. Att. |\n|----------------|------|-----------|\n| Boys' School   | 174  | 153.41    |\n| Girls          | 176  | 156.      |\n| Continuation   | 22   | 19.2      |\n| St. Ann's School | 48  | 44.3      |\n| **Total**      | **420** | **372.91** |\n\nNumber on Roll 420\nAve. Attend. 372.91\n\nJ.M.B.

I presume that most of them will eventually find positions in Montreal, and my hope is that they will prove a credit to their teachers and to the Department. I presume this is the first large graduating class, and I shall be glad to have information at a later date as to their careers. I have no doubt that you will be in communication with them, and I shall be pleased to hear from you again with reference to them.\n\nI trust that you and the members of the staff will thoroughly enjoy your well earned vacation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Gabriel,\nPrincipal, Indian Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nGaughnawaga, Que.,\nJuly 26, 1928.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI filed an application for a position with the Civil Service Commission and I was informed that I could not be admitted even to the examination until I was eighteen years old. I will not be sixteen until September so this gives me two more years to wait. I have tried in vain every place in Montreal but hundreds of applicants have been there before me. I therefore appeal to you again, my dear Mr. Scott, to see if you could not secure some position where I may work and earn the living of my sick mother and young sister. Two of my brothers are being looked after by the Department, a burden of which I could like to relieve you, if I could only find a place suited to my needs.\n\nI can do any kind of clerical work in any Department as I think my training here has been quite good. I am able and most willing to work, and will gladly assume the responsibility of the home if I find employment.\n\nI do not like to turn round and work on the roads or at manual labor for, I am told that I will quickly forget both my shorthand and typewriting.\n\nTrusting that you may do something to help me out of this difficulty.\n\nI am, dear Mr. Scott,\nYour respectful ward,\nJoseph Beauvais.\nBox 91.\n\nMr. D. C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAugust 2nd, 1922.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn Mr. Scott's absence I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ult. I regret that you have not been able to find employment but this is not unusual owing to present conditions in the commercial world. It is quite impossible for Mr. Scott to make any appointment to the Civil Service. As the Department informed the Rev. Sister in charge of the schools at Caughnawaga, these appointments are all made by the Civil Service Commission. It would be useless also to endeavour to find a position in a business office in Ottawa as the demand is so small.\n\nI regret that I am not in a position to give a more favorable reply to your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary to the Deputy.\n\nMr. Joseph Beauvais,\nBox 91,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Que., August 26, 1922.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nNow that the schools will open in a few days I desire to have instructions governing the course of action I will have to follow. Last year we were authorized to employ Assistant Teachers in the three lowest classes which were most congested, but the permit was to expire with the end of the school year. The prospects are that the schools will be filled to their maximum and since no accommodations are yet available, I would request the Department to continue this agreement until a larger school is built for the housing of the children or at least during the year 1922-1923.\n\nIt is next impossible to send away the children already enrolled, and every year a new contingent begs for admittance. If I refuse one or the other a wall goes up and the parents feel they have been unfairly treated. There were twenty white children in the Schools and these we were told not to refuse since their parents lease lands from the Indians, therefore, we may look forward to crowded classrooms even if we refuse to admit any new child under seven years of age.\n\nThe salary paid these Assistants was $30.00 per month and they are employed only in the lower grades where the enrollment goes up and beyond forty and fifty children.\n\nTrusting that I may receive a definite reply before the opening of school,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention of Superintendent of Indian Education.\nOTTAWA, August 31st, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, requesting authority to carry out the same arrangement as last year regarding the engaging of assistant teachers in the lower grades where the enrolment is too heavy to permit the regular teachers to properly carry out the work.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of these assistants during the next school year, at the rate of $30.00 per month each.\n\nThe selection of the assistants will be left in your hands, and it is hoped that you will obtain teachers for this purpose who will be competent and satisfactory to yourself. Vouchers covering the amount of salary due should be forwarded by you in the usual manner at the end of each quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

She is being informed that in every way she is responsible to you for the conduct of the St. Isidore Road School.\n\nI would be pleased if you will make arrangements to visit this school once a week for the time being, at least. You will be allowed $1.50 per trip for livery. You will direct the classroom activities and will arrange for any repairs, cleaning, etc., that may be necessary. If the Village Janitor, Mr. Latour, is unable to oversee the work at the St. Isidore Road School during the winter season, you will please arrange for the services of another competent man and agree to pay him at a fair rate per day. Will you also engage some person living close to the school to scrub the classroom once a week and arrange for the lighting of the furnace fire on Monday morning, only. For these janitor services the Department is prepared to allow the sum of $5.00 per month to whomever you secure. The Department will rely upon you to incur no unnecessary expense.\n\nRequisitions for classroom supplies will be filled only after your O.K. has been received.

It has been decided that this Department will offer assistance to two promising graduates of the Caughnawaga Schools, per annum, to enable them to attend a suitable institution in Montreal. This Department will be responsible for books, fees and carfare; it is considered advisable to have such children taking advanced training live at home in Caughnawaga.\n\nThe students will be selected from the Indian pupils by Sister Mary Gabriel, supervising principal of the Caughnawaga schools, and yourself.

None more than I regret that circumstances should thus deprive the schools of such an active painstaking and devoted Supervisor, and it occurred to me that in view of the many years of faithful service to the Department I would beg to make a suggestion in her behalf. You are aware that she is leaving early in July and since the Canadian National Railways run across to Vancouver would you not be in a position to obtain from the Minister of Railways a pass for herself and her companion that would enable her to travel on the Government Railways free of cost. This, I think would be a tangible proof of your appreciation of her services past and ensure those of the future as I understand she will still be in touch with Government work.\n\nThis act might have further reaching results as the Order of which she will be the official head in British Columbia travels to and from Montreal quite frequently. Every summer over twenty Sisters come East for their vacation. The patronage which they have hitherto given to the Canadian Pacific Railways might be by this act diverted to the Canadian National Railways.\n\nFurthermore it would give me an opportunity of being the instrument by which such a concession would be made and I would be highly pleased to offer this as a tribute to Sister Mary Gabriel.\n\nAs the time is very short and travelling heavy at\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\u2014 (2)\n\nat this season, Sister will have to make her Reservation early. She consulted me about the best way to travel westward but I did not give her any definite answer, promising to inquire into the matter. It was only last night while listening to Mr Perrier eloquent eulogy that this came to my mind, and I hasten to communicate my idea to you, trusting that you will do what lies in your power to obtain this favor for me.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nMr D.

This was more than I could ever have expected for I really feel that I only did my duty. If the schools have progressed, and I feel they have, it was in a large measure due to the hearty cooperation of the Officials of the Department combined with the united efforts of the various teachers in the schools.\n\nThe kind words both written and spoken I know to be sincere, and in consequence I doubly appreciate their value.\n\nIt gave me pleasure to know you intended visiting the West during the summer.

The next day I had the pleasure to meet Mr Russell T.

It is on this ground that the next day I have written the authorization to Rev. Granger, with the following conditions, - lo, the meeting to be held during only one evening of the present month of July, so \u2014 under his care; 3o \u2014 that the Hall be left in the same state of cleanliness:\n\nI am now informed that P.

It is quite a difficult task to find a teacher for our schools, nevertheless, after considerable searching, I found one, Miss Mary Stacey, who will accept to teach for the salary given to Miss Regis in the Village School.\n\nMiss Stacey is twenty-one years of age, single, possessing the Indian and the English languages, serious and very lady-like; she seems to be energetic and ambitious. She says she loves children, therefore winning easily their confidence. That quality I find after my many years of experience, is a great incentive in the art of teaching. She will be under the supervision of an experienced teacher.\n\nAlthough this work is entirely new to me, remain assured, dear Sir, I will work for the welfare of the Indian Schools with the same unselfish interest as did my worthy predecessor, Sister Mary Gabriel.\n\nAwaiting your approval before I give Miss Stacey a decisive answer,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T.

I have noted that Mrs. Annie K. Delormier is prepared to sell her half interest in this property to the Department. Please ask her to submit, in writing, an offer of her interest, indicating the price that would be satisfactory to her.\n\nYou may assure Mrs. Delormier that it is the Department's opinion that John O. Delormier, her stepson, has no right to dispose of any portion of this property, as the will of the late Peter K. Delormier prohibits such action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

This boy being tall & bad habits is leading his school mates to ill-use the Reverend Sister who is becoming so nervous over this state of affair and is getting sick. Dehorn used to loudly command his school fellows in Iroquois language during class hours, this, when his moment seems fit to deal against the Reverend teacher who do not understand him in this language, therefore she is a cause of laughter from the young rebels.\n\nI presume that these insubordinates are taking advises from their Indian parents who are presently aimless, or recreants who are trying to persuade a very few other Indians that the Reverend Sisters should be chased away from the Caughnawaga Indian reserve.\n\nI beg to ask your most urgent advise as to the better way to have this boy punished for an example and the welfare of his followers.\n\nI may add that I am not presently acting on behalf of the Reverend Sister Superior who is using all her possible means to overcome these difficulties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, Sept. 20, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the conduct of one of the pupils, a boy named Dehorn, who is in attendance at the Caughnawaga Boys' School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Superintendent of Indian Education will enquire into this case during his visit to the Reserve, and the action required to meet the situation in this boy's case will be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This like those\nprepared by Sr. Joseph Edward and given to the\nchildren all last school year. To begin, please note\nthe word awarded. I protested against it to the bishop\nbut Sr. Joseph Edward continued to give them to the\nchildren. There are people in Laughlinage who can judge\nof such. And must designate for the children it should\nbe correct, in proper English. As you can not use this\ncard you may rely upon the loyalty and discretion\nof Mr. Scott to send you some from the children.\nI have said a great deal, and could say more\nbut shall close here. Before doing so I wish\nto say that I did not intend to incriminate anything\ndetrimental to Sr. Joseph Edward's reputation. He was\na good, an excellent priest, but has his little ways.\nI need not add that I have confidence in the\ntact and discretion of esteemed Mr. Scott.\n\nYours respectfully,\nSr. Joseph Edward.\n\nMr. Scott will remember that when he came to\nLaughlinage I obtained permission from him\nto open the afternoon session at 1-30. I had the\nfollowing at 1-15 or 1-20 to have the children at work.\nLast year the bell was rung at half past one; work began at a quarter of two. I hold to the holidays named in the Ontario School Regulations. Father's Day, Grandfather's Day, and Thanksgiving Day are extra holidays. In view and other like strange times considered too severe to dispense the Indians to have such teachers in the schools.\n\nL.M.S.\nSt. Anne's Cement,\nLachine, Aug. 22, 1917.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nOttawa.\n\nRespected Sir,\n\nI feel intensely anxious to have to make the following disclosures imposed upon me as a duty of conscience, in view of the recent deplorable troubles in Caughnawaga. I do so relying as ever on your honor and that of the esteemed Superintendent in whose integrity I have confidence. I address him thus, you know he is unable here to control. I have not written to him, for I did not know that I have informed him of the following, it would prove disastrous to me. When I was in Caughnawaga the Indians in general were well and even seemed proud of their schools. Mrs. Joseph Edward, my sister-in-law unsuited for the position. Her instruction was limited that I should feel confident to say how little she does know. She taught music rudiments and is incapable of directing the studies of a child. Her inability and poor health were presumably the cause of her neglecting her classes which she did not merit any of reputation. In short she was a failure. The Indians realized her incompetency. She was dismissed by all, and they made several attempts to have\nhe removed, and to have me return to the school, the present, lying in St. Anne Hospital, Montreal, after a most serious operation. It seems inevitable that she is doomed to return to Caughnawaga as soon as she is able. A protean Superior has been appointed until her return. Father Cass holds to having her return to Canada because she is close to his mother in keeping Sister Eileen, a great friend of his. Father Cass and Sister Eileen may be taken possession of without any change because I wanted to have Sister replaced by a nice person who could do better work with large Indian boys. Last August we got back to Caughnawaga after two weeks' contract, but Eileen fell ill, resulting in affection of the throat and of the vocal cords. Her voice was almost extinct, yet she could take her place another teacher and kept on doing good work. Last February she was sick that the boys had to go to her in the cement, she could not go out. As there was no equipment then instruction was confined to written work. In April a young inexperienced nun was sent to help Sister to take her class while she rested. At the instance of Father Cass, Sister Eileen is returning to Caughnawaga in charge of the large boys although her physician has permitted complete rest, nothing whatever. I need not add that (if anyone wishes to do her work) there is not only an imposition upon the Government, but also an injustice to the Indians and should not be tolerated. I am not prepared to say that Father Cass is\nloyal to his people when for his personal gratification he suggests such an arrangement. It is to be regretted that Father is not more careful in his dealings with the Indians. If he could only try to win their over. I do not speak from any feelings ill will towards the Reverend Father or the Indians. I have invariably been kind to them. The Indians seem not pleased with the schools while I was with them, and Mr. Delisle once spoke ill in public of the schools of me. He said to Sr. Joseph Edward that she was incapable being principal of the schools; it humbles me to say he was right. I felt distressed all appear to have those poor people come to me with complaints of the schools. They would say that everything was broken up; the rule was irregular, discipline was lax, physical training had been discarded. Seeing in the Girls' School was neglected and that there was irregular schedule of learning. The boys would come to corroborate their parents complaints, adding that the timetables had not been followed up. Phonics and other subjects had been left out. The Indians having witnessed the work that had been accomplished the year before criticized the Sisters and the priest. Father says will say that very few are against the schools while few are in favor of them today. The people came here to beg me to return. They tell me the Indians want me to resume my work. They assure me that if I were in C., the troubles would cease. I believe them for I know I had the confidence of the tribe. To get along with them, one must be liked.\nMy success was also due to the fact that I made the Indians understand I was following as closely as possible the precepts of the Department for the Schools. I felt grieved, harassed over the School troubles for which I am not at all responsible. I worked conscientiously for the Indians as well as for the Government. If I had the disposition to run these peculiar and difficult people, surely had it to live in peace with a few ladies who had made me an object of kindness. I was not any too keen with them, I was kind, but exacted good work in the schools, and in that I was right. I was urged on my removal from Longnauage, and I have the right to exonerate myself. I could return without the least embarrassment, I had no disputes with Father Cass. It was also said that I am now incapacitated for work. I am in excellent health, enjoying the same vitality and energy which I need for the welfare of the Indians.\n\nMother Melanie or Superior General accepted the charge of the Longnauage School counting on me as being the best prepared to undertake the education of Indian boys.\n\nInfluenced by false reports she withdrew me, but afterwards regretted her haste. If you do not want the troubles to go on forever, the only way to finish with them is to act firmly with Mother General. The temporary superior holds a diploma, but as the Indians are so badly disposed it would require one in whom they have confidence to win them over. If the Government insist upon my returning to pacify the Indians since the future are responsible to a certain extent for the trouble I am ready to do so. Mr. Scott may inform whom he pleases that he knows from me that I am in Seattle. Please pardon this long letter so badly written.\nThe supreme effort I am making to write it renders me very nervous. Nothing but a grave sense of duty could induce me to speak so. Each word has been weighed and placed before committed to paper. I regret I can not receive acknowledgment of it, this letter, but I shall be compensated by the good resulting from it, for I am deeply interested in the welfare of the Longhouse People. I shall always cherish a grateful remembrance of Revd Mr Scott whose appreciation of my work in C. is a reward of my service to the Department of Indian Affairs. To you, dear Sir MacKenzie, I offer my renewed thanks for past kindness.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWith high consideration,\n\nYours most gratefully,\n\nSister Mary Edward.\n\nI have confidence in His Excellency, Exce. Sturgis and I would not object to his knowing it was I who reported conditions in Longhouse.\n\nSr. M. Edward.\nMost esteemed Sir,\n\nPardon me if I interrupt you in your important duties, but ever since the events of last Spring concerning my return to Cangahawaga I have desired to write you particularly so, since I have been informed that Mr. Delisle lacks any letter to him to Ottawa. I hope, through Mr. Scott, that you do not consider me unfit to be let in Gabriel's or our absence to supervise her. Such matters seem strange to me. While advised you confidentially of Sr. Joseph Edward's incompetency, I complied with the dictates of conscience. I wrote to Mr. Delisle activated by similar motives. I spoke, perhaps rather openly, but did so in view of hastening matters to a prompt decision for I am kept here without a position, though considered the most prepared in our Sisterhood for the management of these schools. Then again, the trouble has been going on too long. The Indians claim that Sr. Gabriel is wanting in control over the boys that the latter are not submissive and give much trouble to the Sisters. Knowing\nthat Sister Gabriel, though a good teacher, is not a disciplinarian, and gives but ordinary formation to children. I give evidence to that which was said by so many. I also know that several of the largest scholars had left the school dissatisfied. I am very sorry the principal has not the confidence she would get more respect to congratulate her than to inform of her. The boys need a firm hand over them for they do not fear much the head officer nor the Father. Sister is described by her staff as being partial in the expression, rough and ready\u2014not particular in the teaching of sound instruction etc.\n\nFather has made everything to Sister Helen remaining in Laughlinaga without considering that the school question is too serious a problem to be treated lightly. He thinks perhaps he is right. I never had any liking with him\u2014my matters and was always respectful to him. However deception has been carried too far for both Father and our Brother General. Mother Melanie knew that I am in good health every way and well able to work. The Bishop would have been pleased to serve the Government but is not aware of my returning to C., but, I presume he also was deceived. Today, the whole thing is known in Laughlinaga, and for this reason the Indians are persistent in their purpose. As the first responsibility of the schools depends up\nSir, you will be well aware that there was something of importance to them. I believe he had not attended publicly to any letter to him or probably would be at work in the school today. He merely stated he had received a letter from a lady of leisure\u2014she did not name me\u2014but his remarks gave occasion to a number of me by those interested in having things as they are.\n\nMuch esteemed Sir, I have long desired to give you this explanation though it is most painful for me to speak so. I do so in full confidence in your honor and discretion as a gentleman. Regretted having written this before but I will know I shall never be sorry for having addressed you this confidential communication. I have not heard one word of any former letter to you, and I feel grateful for your kind consideration of me. I regret that I cannot be the hope of securing acknowledgment of this.\n\nWishing you esteemed and kind Sir, and Yours God's choice blessings on the opening of the coming Christmas season.\n\nWith the highest consideration,\n\nYours most respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Edward.\n\nLondon, Dec. 16, 1915.\nAnd in Scott only it must be that Father Cass and Mother General think that I do not write you. I would not want if they learnt that you had information from me that I am in good health and can see and hear well. This is known to the Indians as well as almost all have said in this letter.\n\nPlease pardon it, it has been written with much emotion.\n\nSr. Mr. Edward\nMost esteemed Sir,\n\nPardon me if I seem intrusive in addressing you again in reference to the Kanginawaga School. It is the interest stake on them that urges me to communicate to you remarks made me by the Indians themselves regarding the three Indian girls employed as teachers in the schools.\n\nAnnie Jacobs, daughter of Mr. Frank Jacobs, has been in charge of the second class in the Girls' School since last January though unqualified for the position. Annie Leboeuf and Miss Regie teach the two primary classes, the latter in the Boys' School, the former in the Girls' School. These girls can not develop language in young children when they have so very little themselves. No worse precedent could be given than to introduce them into the schools as teachers of English. The people have no confidence in them; they say: \"These girls are not fit to be teachers, they do not know any more than we do.\" It appears to me that it is lowering the standard of the schools.\nto have such persons on the staff. Sister Dr. Gabriel once claimed that she has no accommodation for white teachers. I had two, they took their meals at the convent and I rented a bedroom for them in one of the best families. An Indian girl could have been engaged by the Sisters to teach catechism in English one hour every day, in each of those primary classes, to help prepare the children for first communion.\n\nWe assured good Mr. Scott, that in the present case as well as in everything else of which I have written you regarding myself or concerning the school, I have spoken the truth. When Cunningham showed a deep interest in the Indians and it was solely for their welfare that I have spoken. Before concluding I must repeat my sincere thanks to you, esteem me for having reposed the entire confidence I had reason to place in you, most worthy and devoted Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nSincerely,\n\nWith the highest consideration,\n\nYours most respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Edward.\n\nSt. Anne's Convent,\nLaforme, June 26, 1919.\nJuly 3, 1919.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nIt has been represented to me that the Sisters in charge of the Caughnawaga Indian Schools are utilizing the services of some of the Senior Indian girls as teachers. Mention has been made of Miss Annie Jacobs, Miss Annie Lefebvre and Miss Regis. It is also represented that the Indians are objecting to this action on the part of those in charge. Will you kindly let me know if the allegations are true, and if so to what extent the services of the girls are being used as tutors.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ. H. Brossard, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 3rd instant regarding the ten Indian girls that the Sisters have employed last year as teachers in Baughmaroaga Schools, I beg to say that the representations made to Department by Indians are true. The principal has employed these girls temporarily on account of the lack of sisters, and the difficulty of securing white girls willing to live and board in Indian homes.\n\nI would suggest to you to write at once to the Principal requesting that she dismisses those girls and place sisters in each one of the classes for the reopening of the schools next September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.M.T. Brosseau\nIndian Agent.\n\nHuncain B. Scott, Esq.\nDeputy Superintendent General\nOttawa\nJuly 15, 1919.\n\nDear Madam -\n\nIt has recently been represented to me that during the past term you have been utilizing the services of certain Indian girls to give instruction to the pupils in the Caughnawaga schools. While it might be possible to utilize the services of these senior pupils under certain circumstances it is not considered wise to give the Indians cause for complaint. The Department will, therefore, expect you to discontinue the practice on the reopening of the school and to place all rooms in charge of qualified teachers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Sister M. Gabriel,\nPrincipal Caughnawaga Indian Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Que., 8/8/1919.\n\nMy dear Mr. Scott,\n\nYour letter of some few weeks ago relative to the employment of Iroquois girls as Teachers in the schools has given me some little preoccupation and concern, and I delayed writing until I could see what could be done in the matter.\n\nI would first call your kind attention to the fact that qualified teachers will not come to Caughnawaga for the salary given in the three primary grades, viz. $200, $350. Moreover the best qualified teacher, be she a University Graduate, is powerless before 40 or 50 children who do not understand a word she is saying, hence the necessity of having Iroquois girls as interpreters.\n\nI have talked the matter over with the authorities at our Mother-house and have secured the services of two extra Sisters to fill the places of the lay teachers, but neither of them know the language, nor are they willing to devote their time to learning it when the demands for higher qualifications are so pressing. I will be under the necessity of employing Iroquois girls as substitutes and interpreters in the two lower classes if I wish any progress to be made, but they will be under the direction of Sisters who will take charge of the classes.\n\nThere are here two groups of Indians arraigned against each other in bitter enmity. If a girl is chosen from one group it excites the displeasure of the other for no other reason than that she belongs to the opposite party. The complaints made by the Indians were based on this, for the girls employed did very good work and gave entire satisfaction as the Inspector's report will prove. Besides they worked and taught under my direct and\nImmediate supervision, and they were not senior pupils, but full grown girls, one of them 26 years old, who has been teaching in the schools since 1915 with good results.\n\nWould you not consider, my dear Mr. Scott, that the salaries of the teachers in the lower grades might be raised to meet the demands created by existing conditions? It is true that the bonus last year helped greatly, but should that be withdrawn, it would be difficult to carry on the work of the schools satisfactorily, especially as you hold to having qualified teachers in all the classes.\n\nTrusting that my explanation of the situation will be satisfactory to you, and that my request will meet with your approval,\n\nI am, dear Mr. Scott,\n\nYours very cordially,\n\nSister Mary Gabriel\nPrincipal\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nAssistant Deputy General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nAugust 15th, 1919.\n\nDear Madam -\n\nI have your letter of the 8th inst., regarding complaints made by some of the Caughnawaga Indians, with reference to the services of Indian girls as tutors in the schools.\n\nPersonally I do not see any objection to the services of these girls being utilized to a limited extent under direct supervision, and in the meantime I will not ask you to refrain from so engaging them.\n\nI am sorry that I cannot at present increase the salaries of the teachers at Caughnawaga. The bonus will be paid at least for this year, but of course we can make no promises for the future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent\n\nRev. Sister M. Gabriel,\nPrincipal, Caughnawaga Indian Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nDecember 13, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nI have to thank you for letting me read the attached letter. We had been dealing with the application of certain Protestant Indians for a day school on the Caughnawaga Reserve. I hope to come to some conclusion about it before long. As you are aware, there is a large majority of Roman Catholics on this reserve, and there is no stable number of Protestants that can be actually counted as such. While there are a few consistent Protestant families, their number fluctuates as they obtain recruits from dissatisfied Roman Catholics. The Protestant day school at Caughnawaga was closed in June, 1919, with full concurrence of the Methodist Missionary Society, who were associated with us in the management. The main reason for closing the school was the poor attendance. The interests of the Roman Catholic or Protestant minority are protected by the law, and we endeavour to provide the minority with schools. I hope before long to have a Protestant school opened on the reserve.\n\nIt is altogether likely that this letter was sent to the editors of other newspapers, and I am prepared to find it in print, but I have to thank you for letting me see it and giving me the opportunity of preparing an answer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nR. Norman Smith, Esq.,\nEditor,\n\"The Journal\"\nOttawa.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Oct. 4, 1923.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nOwing to overwork on account of a little siege of Grippe among any Teachers, I was unable to thank you before now for the increase of salary, as well as for an extra allowance for sewing and a small grant for a messenger when my duties reclaim one.\n\nI am most grateful, dear Sir, and I deeply appreciate your great interest in all that concerns us. May you never have occasion to regret the kindness just bestowed upon me.\n\nThanking you once more for having considered my request,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. A.F.

I wish to thank you most sincerely for sending us all this material which will be very useful and which we will turn to very best account.\n\nI am sure after such a long silence, a little news about the Schools will interest you. There has been a great deal of sickness among the children since January. Colds, grippe, sore throat, measles and especially the itch which is due largely to sanitation. Sometimes the pupils are weeks out of school with that disease because they are not properly dictoried. We have eight pupils in the hospital. I visited them Sunday. All are on the speedy road to recovery excepting Tom Albany, a smart and good boy of fourteen, who has heart trouble and Ida Mayo who I think is threatened with tuberculosis.\n\nThe St. Isidore Road School opened last week with an attendance of twelve pupils out of twenty. The terrible snow storm kept many away for a few days.\n\nI have taken monthly examinations in all the classes and the results have been most gratifying. I am astonished at the work accomplished with such a class of children.\n\nI will be absent from March 18th to the 29th, to attend the annual retreat and lectures given to the Principals of our Order. Special lectures are given concerning the important work of directing schools. As we are required to give an account of our Schools, may I ask if the Government intends to better the conditions of Delormier School for the next scholastic year? If there is a question of a new school, will the Department expend any money to repair the Schools and beautify the surroundings?\n\nThanking you once more for your great kindness,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T.

The Department is pleased to learn that, in spite of considerable sickness, the classroom activity has been of a satisfactory nature. Your absence for a few days this month, to attend the annual retreat and lectures given to Principals of your Order, is noted and approved. I trust that you will make satisfactory arrangements for the management of the schools during your absence.\n\nRelative to improvements to the buildings and the question of providing more accommodation.

James Mabon.\nSir,\n\nI am pleased to make, for your information, the following statement of the average percentage obtained by the pupils of the Caughnawaga Indian Day Schools, during the examinations made last week by Reverend Sister Marguerite Marie, Professeur G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des \u00c9tudes of the Sisters St. Ann:\n\nContinuation School .................................. 91%\nBoys' School - Standard IV, V, VI .................. 87%\n\" \" \" III, & Primary Classes ...................... 80%\nGirls' \" \" IV, V, VI, ............. 80%\n\" \" \" III, & Primary Classes ...................... 84%\nSt. Isidore Road School............................... 70%\n\nReverend Sister had not visited the Reserve since 1910 and she found wonderful progress in every branch of study, as well as in the demeanor and development of the children. It is certainly gratifying to us to hear such excellent reports given by the different Inspectors that visit the Schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nYou are no doubt aware of the fact that the pupils have very able and efficient Teachers, who not only labor with untiring efforts to the promotion of education and the advancement of civilization, but, they guide and assist the young to seek the higher life. This faithful and efficient staff of Teachers that show heroic courage in leading young and plastic minds to what is good and noble, have not the least bit of consolation or gratefulness from the Indians of Caughnawaga, who are so unreasonable, exacting and ungrateful.\n\nI am well pleased to say in all truth that\n\n... general\nGeneral proficiency and high moral tone prevail.\n\nWithout being presumptuous, I believe our Schools in Caughnawaga can compete with any school of the white race. The result is the one of our devoted and painstaking Sisters. I know the Department appreciates, by comparison, the thorough Christian Education with the careless, less refined development so common in many schools today.\n\nThe Mother General of the Order begged Sister Superior of the Caughnawaga Day Schools to ask for an increase of salary for some of the Sisters, I approve that movement because I wonder why they are not paid the salary of lay teachers, who have neither their experience, their capacity, their solicitude nor their interest. For instance, Miss Martin is getting a much larger salary than all the teachers, excepting one. I can say conscientiously that the latter is not doing half as good work, discipline and formation are wanting.\n\nThe work done by the Sisters in Caughnawaga is gratifying to the Department as it is a credit to their noble calling.\n\nI feel sure that you will favourably consider my request for a readjustment of the teacher's salaries in the Village of Caughnawaga.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am rather late in notifying you of the illness of one of my teachers, but actually I have had my hands full lately. Sr. M. Oswald, teacher of the second class at the Girl's School was taken sick suddenly April 26th. Her condition being critical I had her brought to the Incline Hospital in the ambulance and the doctors found her case urgent so that she was operated on immediately.\n\nBeing unable to get a Sister at our Training School, I applied to the Montreal Board of Education for a teacher. It was utterly impossible to get a teacher for that class for the salary paid Sister Mary Oswald, ($40.00/month). After many pleadings I succeeded in getting one for fifty-five ($55.) a month. For a minute I really did not know just what to do, but then I felt sure the Department would rather pay the surplus than have me turn away the forty girls of that class.\n\nI did to the best of my knowledge and I hope both you and the Department Officials will approve of my doings.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(Sgd.)- Sister Mary Rose Alma\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. L. Letourneau,\nAgent of Indian Affairs,\nSaint-Constant, P.Q.\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter dated the 14th instant, from the Supervising Teacher of the Caughnawaga Indian Day Schools, relating that on account of the illness of one of the teachers at the Girls' school, she had to manage in order to get her a substitute from the Board of Education, Montreal, at a salary of $15. higher than the one usually paid to Reverend Sister M. Oswald. I beg to recommend that in view of the untiring efforts of the Reverend Sister Superior for the development of the children of Caughnawaga, a grant of $15. per month, for the remaining months of the present school year, be allowed to cover the surplus paid to a substitute.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, May 19th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from Sister Mary Rose Alma, Supervising Principal of the Caughnawaga Indian Schools, regarding the action taken by her in obtaining the services of a teaching sister to replace Sister Oswald, teacher of the second class at the girls' school, who, on account of illness, had to give up work.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the action taken by the Supervising Principal in obtaining the services of a substitute teacher to replace Sister Oswald, and will allow salary for the substitute at the rate of $55 per month during the period she is engaged, which should not extend, at the increased rate, beyond the end of the present school year, viz: June 30th. Salary will be allowed Sister Oswald for the month of April at the rate previously paid, and the substitute will be paid, from the 1st instant, at the rate of $55 per month.

Delormier in connection with the leasing of the property in which he has a joint share with Mrs. Annie K. Delormier. On March 27th, last, Mrs. Delormier was given notice of the Department's intention to lease the property for one year, commencing June first, 1924. She has been paid rental to December 31st, next. Mr. Indian Agent Letourneau, at our request, has written her for a release from paying any further rental. We gave up our use of the property on June 30, last.\n\nIn view of the difficulties in connection with this estate and the unsatisfactory sanitary conditions of the Delormier house (which caused the Department to look for another building for the two classes), I wish to recommend that Mr. Chene make arrangements with Mr. C. Cloud, owner of a building opposite the teacher's residence, for one year's rental. He has signified willingness to rent for $150 per annum.\n\nMr. Letourneau estimates the alterations and decorating to the Cloud property at $500, but I believe that the work can be done for less. I also recommend that Mr. Chene receive your authority to undertake the alterations and decorating that are necessary for our purposes.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nTeacher's Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Sept., 27, 1924.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis letter is to inform you that the doctor advises me to take a few weeks' rest. My condition is not serious now but to avoid a long siege of illness it is expedient for me to put aside all work and worry. Therefore, I shall leave for our Sanatorium at Val David, Thursday, Oct. 2nd.\n\nAlthough everything is straightened out and the schools in good order, I foresee one drawback to the fine attendance we usually have, and that is having a new truant officer who has no experience with these stiff necks. I repeat again, that I am very sorry that the Government did not retain Mr. Jocks' services and assuredly we will be the losers. Already the pupils feel there is no truant officer and in some boy's class, yesterday, seven were absent; that never happened before.\n\nWould you please allow me to purchase a few dozen of second hand Bible Histories at half price? With a little repairing they will be as good as new.\n\nI received the Spellers and Report Cards for which I thank you.\n\nWe are expecting the school inspector, Mr. Cuddihy, next Monday.\n\nThanking you for your past kindness,\n\nI am,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T. Perrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 4, 1924.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, informing the Department that, on the advice of your physician, you have found it necessary to take a few weeks' rest from your duties as supervising principal of the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Schools. It is hoped that the rest which you purpose taking will prove of much benefit to your health and that you will, as a result, be able to resume duties, greatly improved.\n\nRegarding the appointment of a truant officer, I have to say that this matter is receiving the attention of the Department and it is hoped to have the question settled at an early date, either by the retention of Mr. Jocke's services or the appointment of a satisfactory incumbent for the position.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of a few dozen of second hand Bible Histories, which you state you can procure at half the regular price. You should obtain an account, in duplicate, for the cost of these books. Please hand the account to Mr. Agent Letourneau and request him to certify and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nWe note that the School Inspector, Mr. Cuddihy, purposed visiting the schools at Caughnawaga on the 29th ultimo. We will await, with interest, his reports.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Rose Alma,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Day Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nSir:\n\nI beg to ask you whether the Sister Superior of the Caughnawaga Day Schools is to have your authorization to close schools for the Christmas holidays on the 19th instant. I presume that in the case of the permit being granted, Mrs A. Beauvais, Teacher of the Caughnawaga Bush school would be authorized to do the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, December 9th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 5th instant, I beg to inform you that the schools on the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve may close for the Christmas holidays on the afternoon of the 19th instant. You may inform the Reverend Sister and the teachers of the other schools accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nOttawa, December 17, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your conversation with Mr. Ferrier, I wish to say that you may authorize Sister Mary Rose Alma, Principal of the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day Schools, to visit Ottawa some time in the near future. Ask her to write to Mr. Ferrier, indicating the date of her visit, so that he will be free to discuss the questions relative to the education of the Indian children at Caughnawaga.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nP. Q.\nEXTRACT FROM MONTHLY REPORT OF L. LETOURNEAU,\nINDIAN AGENT, DATED DECEMBER 23, 1924, ON THE\nCAUGHNAWAGA INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS.\n\nThe Reverend Supervising Principal, Sister Mary\nRose Alma, has asked several times if Article 10 of\nthe Indian Act could not be amended. Why not impose\na fine if a child is out more than one day without\npermission, also a fine if the same child comes in tardy.\nMany parents are very obstinate in sending their children\nafter all their chores are finished, so those children come\nin daily between 9:30 and ten o'clock. The parents reply\nthat they are their children and that they can keep them\nas long as they need them. How can those children learn or\nmake progress when they lose one hour of school every day.\nI hope you will take this matter into consideration and help\nconditions. The Sisters' work as hard to make their\npupils advance, we should do all in our power to lighten\ntheir task so difficult with such stiff-necks.\nMy dear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nMan proposes and God disposes. Such is my case regarding my trip to Ottawa; therefore I will not have the pleasure of my long desired interview with you concerning the pupils and schools of the Caughnawaga Reserve until your visit which I hope will be before early spring.\n\nConcerning the teaching of domestic science, I find it would be extravagant to make a considerable outlay if the Department intended to build a new school next year.\n\nSince we have no electricity from now until the end of the year we could give theory lessons in culinary art in the typewriting room. It is large enough and the typewriting tables could be used instead of desks. Of course it would\nbe necessary to have a kitchen cabinet so as to have the most needed utensils and the measures for the proportions.\n\nA kitchen cabinet, medium size, good quality costs from one hundred forty-five dollars up.\n\nMay I expect to hear from you soon as I should like to have the matter settled before school re-opens.\n\nWishing you a year full of health, success and prosperity,\n\nBelieve me, dear Sir,\nRespectfully yours,\nSister Mary Rose Anna\nPrincipal\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 30th, 1924.\n\nDear Sister Mary Rose Alma:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, and I note with regret that you will be unable to visit Ottawa at this time.\n\nYour scheme for commencing domestic science appears to be the best arrangement, and I should be pleased if you would hand to Mr. Indian Agent Letourneau illustrations and prices of a kitchen cabinet that would be suitable. Have him then make a recommendation to the Department as to which one should be purchased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nSister Mary Rose Alma,\nSupervising Principal,\nCaughnawaga Indian Day Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawage Dec. 27, 1924.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to thank you most heartily for your kindness in allowing me to visit Ottawa, but I feel very sorry that owing to some very good reason, I am now forced to sacrifice my interview with Mr. Ferrier as well as the pleasure of meeting the officials of the Department, who are so considerate and so good to us.\n\nWishing you a year of health, success and prosperity,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. J.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMy dear Sir:\n\nThe pupils have returned in large number after their well deserved holidays. So far we have had very little sickness considering the cold weather, bad roads, and poor clothing.\n\nIn spite of the many difficulties that prevail among the people here, the teachers with their great courage and indefatigable zeal succeed in obtaining good work from the pupils in general.\n\nI am sorry to inform you that the teacher of the 2nd Class Boys' School is very sick since Dec. 22nd, and I am handicapped for a teacher. It is exceedingly hard to find a teacher on account of the trouble and the paper gossip concerning the repairs of the Church, nevertheless I can find a good competent teacher who would accept the position for Sixty ($60.00) Dollars a month, but of course, I cannot engage her without your approval because the present teacher is drawing a salary of only Forty-five ($45.00) Dollars a month. This young lady expects to leave the city around the 13th if I do not hire her, so please wire me the answer.\n\nThanking you for the attention, I know, you will give this urgent request,\n\nI remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 12, 1925.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Rose Alma,\nCaughnawaga Indian School,\nAdirondack Junction, Que.\n\nIf member of your order not available as temporary teacher boys second class you may engage other services temporarily at sixty dollars per teaching month plus bonus.\n\nJ. D. McLEAN.\n\nChs. Dept. I. A.\nOttawa, January 12, 1925.\n\nReverend Sister:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to a substitute teacher to take the place of the Sister in charge of the second class of the Boys' School, who is ill. I have to confirm, in reply, official day letter of today's date, as follows:\n\n\"If member of your order not available as temporary teacher, boys' second class, you may engage other services temporarily at sixty dollars per teaching month, plus bonus.\"\n\nI take it for granted that the young lady whom you contemplate engaging is not a Sister. The Department will approve of the temporary appointment of a lay teacher at a salary of $60 per teaching month, plus bonus, if the services of a Sister are not available. I should be pleased if you would let me have the name of the new teacher and intimate the probable length of time that her services will be required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Rose Alma,\nSupervising Principal,\nCaughnawaga R. C. Indian Day Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter dated 30th December last, to the Reverend Sister Mary Rose Alma, Supervising Teacher of the Caughnawaga Indian Day Schools, I beg to say that it appears impossible for the Reverend Sister, on account of the rules of her Community to visit the Department, unless you command her to do so.\n\nAs to her scheme for commencing domestic science, it now appears that the price of a kitchen cabinet is too high and not entirely suitable for its purpose. It is however suggested by the Reverend Sister that arrangements could be made in the proposed new school building for a room and necessary apparatus that would meet the requirements for a class of domestic science, which I believe would be greatly beneficial to the Indian girls of Caughnawaga. In the meantime, as also suggested by the Reverend Sister, it may be preferable to make the purchase of one sewing machine and the necessary tables for the use of the Indian girls who could practice during each school days. The price of a kitchen cabinet is $185.00, while one sewing machines and tables would not exceed $100.00 which I beg to recommend for approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nMr. Russel H. Perrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, January 15th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, relative to the requirements of the Rev. Sister Superior of the Caughnawaga Indian Day Schools in instituting a class in domestic science for the benefit of the older girls in the schools and recommending that a sewing machine and the necessary tables be supplied.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are today placing an order with the Singer Sewing Machine Company here to furnish from their nearest branch office 1 Singer sewing machine of the style described in their catalogue as follows:\n\nNo. 2 - 5 Drawer Machine, 127 - 3 G.O.\n\nThe above firm have been requested to advise you when this machine will be available, and you should then give them full shipping directions for the delivery of the machine.\n\nThe account, in duplicate, will also be sent you, and, when the machine arrives, if in good condition, please certify the account and send it to the Department in order that payment can be made. The account will show the retail price and a discount of 40%, on which terms purchase is made.\n\nYou may purchase and have installed 2 tables of a type suitable to meet the requirements of the Reverend Sister. No unnecessary expenditure should be incurred, and properly certified vouchers should be forwarded covering the cost of the tables. Before making the purchase you should consult the Reverend Sister and ascertain exactly what she requires.\n\nWe are not prepared to supply the kitchen cabinet at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\n\nNote: Sewing machine ordered on 5-1-5.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Jan. 20, 1925.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nUpon receipt of your telegram, I sent a special message to the teacher I had in view but she had left on the 12th. You cannot imagine my disappointment to find myself in such a predicament. It is a very hard proposition to find a teacher for Indian Schools. One must be gifted with a great deal of patience and courage to succeed with these sturdy Iroquois.\n\nAfter many inquiries, I was able to obtain the services of Miss Charlotte Williams, a resident of Caughnawaga and a graduate of Class 1922. She is doing well under the circumstances and I hope that before long she will assume control.\n\nSister Mary Angelique is not much better and the doctor thinks it will take about two months before she can resume her office.\n\nThanking you for your co-operation in our many difficulties,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nVery cordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. L.D.

How very practical and how necessary, for most mothers here have no aptitudes and little notion of neat sewing.\n\nNow their next ambition is to have lessons in culinary art. If the Department intends us to teach domestic science next year, we are unable to conduct that course in the Boys' School. May I ask if there are any prospects of a new school?\n\nIn regard to the \"North American Teacher\" we have received regularly. We would all feel very sorry to discontinue reading that instructive and helpful periodical. Even the most experienced teachers value it highly for its fine lessons in discipline and formation of character and the various notes on pedagogy. Nevertheless if it is your desire to cancel that publication I shall acquiesce to your wish.\n\nAlthough we receive the Primary Education I shall be glad to subscribe for the \"Canadian Teacher\" as one primary paper is hardly enough for the several teachers of the primary classes.\n\nThere is quite a lot of sickness among the pupils. I expect to have an interview with Doctor Jacobs to-morrow morning.\n\nThanking you for past favors,\n\nI am,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 26, 1925.\n\nMadam:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of recent date and am pleased to learn that practical sewing is now being taught to the girls of the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day School. It may be advisable to commence simple manual training for the boys at a later date. I regret that there will be no funds available for the erection of a new school building this year. There are so many pressing claims on Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education, that it is difficult to meet all the requirements.\n\nThat portion of your letter with reference to the teacher's aids will be the subject of another communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The itch is a plague here. I am happy to hear that Reverend Sister Superior has given an impetus towards hygiene, which is lacking among the Iroquois in general.\n\nThe Board of Hygiene upon Sister's Superior's request has sent pamphlets describing the causes and effects of diseases. These have excited their curiosity and all are desirous of following the instructions given, which in time will help matters regarding cleanliness.\n\nDuring the spring the roads here are extremely muddy; consequently the class rooms are very dirty every day and should be swept. It is utterly impossible for one person to clean seven large rooms, seven ward-robos and corridors after school closes, still it should be done since the teachers insist so much on cleanliness. The school rooms should be an example how to keep their homes clean. I would suggest that a small amount, about 35 cents a day, be allowed for a helper to do the sweeping after school hours. That could be supervised by myself but the Principal could hire some boy to do the cleaning in one of the schools.\n\nSome repairing is needed in the different schools. I shall write you on this subject later.\n\nThe spirit of the pupils is better, and there is\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 3rd, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your report of the 1st instant on the Caughnawaga Indian Day Schools for the March quarter, last. We are pleased to note that there was a good attendance maintained despite the fact that there was considerable sickness among the pupils.\n\nRegarding the difficulty, owing to the muddy condition of the roads, in keeping the floors of the classrooms clean, I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to consider your suggestion to allow a small amount to a helper to do the sweeping after school hours. It is considered that the janitors employed should attend to all the cleaning required during the short period until the roads and grounds around the school dry up.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nP.Q.\nAt St-Constant,\n\nApril 2nd, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to ask you whether the R.C. schools in Baughnawaga may close during the whole of the Easter week, as it has been done last year at the Protestant School, and presumably this year, and, to re-open again on the 20th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 8th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 2nd instant, I beg to say that all the schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve may close for the Easter holidays from the afternoon of the 9th instant until the morning of the 20th. You will be good enough to inform the teachers accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nP.Q.\nSir,\n\nHaving taken knowledge of a letter dated 8th instant from the Reverend Sister Superior of the Caughnawaga Indian Day Schools, to the Superintendent of Indian Education, in connection to the proposed branches of domestic science, I beg to say that the suggestions made by the Reverend Sister Superior would be greatly appreciated by the Indians of Caughnawaga who are certainly in need of lessons in culinary art as well as the advantage that they presently take of the lessons of practical sewing. As requested in her letter to the Superintendent of Indian Education, I beg to ask that the Department gives to this question a favourable consideration.\n\nAs to the increase of the teachers' salary mentioned in Reverend Sister Superior's letter, I believe that the minimum salary paid to the teaching Sisters should not be less than $500.00 per annum, the present minimum being $350.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, May 26th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 16th instant, regarding the request which you state was made in a communication dated the 8th instant from the Reverend Sister Superior of the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day School, I beg to say that this letter of the Reverend Sister's does not appear to have been received in the Department, as we can find no record of same. Please have the Reverend Sister prepare and forward a copy of her communication, when the matters referred to therein will receive consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nMy object in writing you today is to inquire if we shall look forward to a special prize from you to be given to the best pupil of the Second Year Continuation School. We shall consider it quite an honor to present a premium donated by the Superintendent of Indian Education.\n\nI am pleased to say that the most advanced girls have put to good advantage the lessons of practical sewing. They appreciate that movement and understand the necessity of domestic science. They are expecting lessons in culinary art next year since electricity is going to be installed in the village. It certainly would be the greatest and the most useful help to all the mothers who cannot teach their children how to cook.\n\nIf the Department wishes us to undertake that branch of domestic science, I would have to know it before July, as the higher Authorities of our Institution appoint the teachers during vacation and I would have to apply early, as not many teachers are available. In view of the new activity I consulted Reverend Mother General who not send out any teacher of domestic science for a salary of less than $500.00 per year.\n\nWhen the sewing class was opened last February I said nothing of the salary given to our sewing teachers because I remembered with feelings of gratitude the unexpected increase of salaries you gave us for the last quarter of the year 1924. While speaking of salary, I am sure you will agree with me that there is a staff of proficient, conscientious and devoted teachers in the Indian Schools here and those that are drawing a salary of less than $500.00 are underpaid.\n\nI would be very grateful if you would consider this matter. Thanking you for past favors, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, May 8, 1925.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nWould you be good enough to let me know at your earliest convenience if the Department will allow $105.00 as in the past, for the purchase of prizes for the pupils of the Caughnawaga and St. Isidore Roman Catholic Indian Day Schools.\n\nThe pupils have worked well in spite of all unpleasant happenings on the Reserve. The spirit is much better; education is making progress rapidly, therefore broadening the minds of so many stiff-necks and ignorant Indians, who are happy only when on the war-path.\n\nOne boy, Thomas Deerhouse, who is bright, very industrious and reliable, and three girls, Annie Barbes, Julia Saylor and Emma Canadian, all intelligent, diligent and trustworthy, are competing their Second Year Continuation Class and are well prepared for a higher education. With the exception of the latter, they are looking forward to an advanced educational course if the Department allows them a grant. I have every confidence that they will be a credit to the Department and to the Band. The latter, Emma Canadian although qualified, will have to discontinue her studies to help support the family. I shall try to secure her a position as saleslady in a store in Montreal.\n\nI cannot tell you how sorry I am that the Department is not building a new school next year. Our rooms are overcrowded especially in the Second Class, Boys' School, because many families have returned from the States. Something will have to be done or I shall be forced to turn away boys of eleven and twelve years old, next September.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. L.D. McLean,\nAsst.

I beg to enclose them herein and to accept my excuse.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, June 2, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing two communications dated the 8th instant, from the Reverend Sister Superior of the Caughnawaga Roman Catholic Indian Day Schools.\n\nAs you have been informed in official letter of the 26th ultimo, the Department authorized a grant not exceeding $105.00 for the purchase of prizes or other suitable gifts to be given to the children of the Village and St. Isidore Road Schools at the annual closing.\n\nWith reference to the children who have completed their two years continuation class and are prepared for a higher education, it is presumed that the principal will later make a recommendation in the case of each for whom she requires that an advanced educational grant be provided.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to award a special prize of $10.00 again this year to the girl taking the best standing in her studies. The Reverend Principal should nominate the girl to whom the award is to be granted and you should forward a voucher, in duplicate for the amount, stating the name of the girl. A cheque will be sent you and you can then arrange to give the amount in gold. Please attend to this matter as soon as possible.\n\nRegarding the conducting of a class in culinary art, I regret that, through lack of accommodation it will not be possible to provide for this activity until a new school building is erected. It will, therefore, not be necessary to obtain the services of a teacher to carry on this work next year.\n\nWith reference to the principal's request that those teachers who are drawing salary of less than $500.00 a year be granted an increase up to that amount, I beg to say that there are no funds available this year for any increase in salaries. Owing to the many calls on the funds at our disposal it is absolutely necessary that no new expenditure be incurred during the present fiscal year.\n\nPlease inform the Reverend Principal in accordance with the contents of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

She found the children much improved, the English spoken and written surprising, the attendance remarkable. Sister is much pleased with the general proficiency of the classes which is a credit to the teachers and the pupils as well as the Indian Department.\n\nI am sorry to inform you that Annie Barnes and Emma Canadian, two graduates of last year, who attend the Boarding School have been forced to give up their studies. The former through sickness, the latter has just lost her mother and her sick father needs her at home.\n\nMay I recall to your mind that the lease of the Sacred Heart School expires in August? The two rooms in that building are very much overcrowded for the health and convenience of the pupils and teachers. The putty that filled the openings between the boards is falling and the pupils suffer from the cold in spite of the well-heated furnace.\n\nI shall be away from March 4th to the 12th to attend the annual retreat for Superiors.

When you have nominated the girl to whom this award is to be granted, you should so inform Mr. Agent Letourneau.

The walls of the 1st class-Girls' school were covered from ceiling to floor. Such an amount of work! What labor and patience it showed! The parents were proud of their children and they had reason. Even little girls of nine years made aprons or crocheted bags.\n\nThe teachers are indefatigable in their zeal for our Indian children. The strain of that extra work, that of preparing their sewing class has been so great upon the teachers that Sister Superior does not think it possible to impose sewing to the class-teachers next year.\n\nFor the welfare of the girls here who need to be taught sewing, more than elsewhere, would be possible for the Department to pay a small salary to a teacher who would have charge of the sewing to all the Indian girls.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, June 23, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to a splendid display of sewing by the pupils of the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day School. The Department is much pleased to learn of the success of this work. I note your recommendation that a small salary be allowed for an extra Sister, who will instruct in this important activity. Please explain to the Rev. Principal that our funds are extremely limited this year, but that they should bring the matter to the attention of the Superintendent of Indian Education, who expects to make an inspection of the schools at Caughnawaga some time in September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Q.\nSir,\n\nI wish to make the following report concerning the Schools of the Village of the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve.\n\nThe year has been very good in every way. The pupils are making rapid progress under the constant care and devotedness of their teachers. I was sorry that no member of the Department was present at the commencement Exercise, you would have judged for yourself. All agreed that the grace and ease with which each pupil came forward to get the rewards merited were remarkable. One spokesman said he has assisted such closing exercises for forty years as he was a school inspector in a northern district and that the attitude and the discipline of the pupils, together with their perfect diction of foreign languages were unequalled. The clipping enclosed herein will perhaps interest you.\n\nMay I ask when the many repairs asked for be tended to?\n\nThe Reverend Sister Superior wishes to assure you that all you do for the Indian children and for the teachers is fully appreciated by the teaching staff. The work done in the schools is a credit to the Department and to the Reverend Sisters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nCAUGHNAWAGA HAS\n\nThe little Iroquois children sang and recited in French and English with ease and grace, at the commencement exercises of the school conducted by the Sisters of St. Ann this week in Kateri Tekakwitha's Hall, Caughnawaga. Rev. Fr. Lambert, S.J., priest of the parish, presided and there were a number of guests, among them being Rev. Jesus Father, Mother Mary Colombe, one of the General Councillors of the Order of St. Ann, Brother Maximin Mass, prefect of studies at Mount Saint Anne as well as many friends from Montreal, Lachine and Beauharnois.\n\nAmong the items in the program were a duet by Moszkowski, a song of welcome, accompanied by Mr. Deslauriers' violins; the conferring of diplomas and gold medals to the continuation class, a dialogue\u2014\"The Arch of Triumph,\" by Patriotic Songs, \"Joan of Arc,\" in French, by C. Souchet. It was a surprise to the audience to hear the French division of the children while singing in a native tongue. The boys gave a recitation, \"Our Heroes.\" Special prizes were awarded for Christian deportment, application, politeness, correct English, history, geography, drawing, needlework, regularity, punctuality, application to the study of French, domestic science, hygiene. The prizes received by the pupils were given by the Department of Indian Affairs, Russel Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, who offered a ten dollar gold piece to the pupil who had attained the highest percentage during the year.

The average attendance for the year speaks eloquently of the devotion of the Sisters and the attraction of the school for the pupils. They conducted themselves in the school and on the street like little ladies and little gentlemen.\n\nThe copies, drawings and maps of the pupils deserve a high note of appreciation. The weakness in Arithmetic, noted last year, has disappeared and the results are first class. I would note specially for praise and commendation the continuation classes, wherein the pupils answered equally well in Arithmetic, Geography, History of Canada, English dictation, English Composition and typewriting, as well as the best of the same grade in Montreal. A couple of the lower classes fell below the high standard in reading, due, I am sure to overcrowding. At least two more lower classes are needed.\n\nMiss Regis and Mrs. Beauvais deserve praise for the very satisfactory results obtained by their pupils.\n\nT. F. Cuddihy,\nSchool Inspector.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, July 4, 1926.\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nAfter such a splendid year, it behooves me to give you a good report of our schools. The year has been successful in every way. The pupils have profited of the advantages given them so gratuitously. The attendance and punctuality were remarkable. The results obtained in both oral and written examinations during the year were very satisfactory in the higher classes especially. The crowded lower classes are a drawback to the pupils and it makes the work very difficult and strenuous for the teachers. The exhibition of needlework was quite an innovation and the parents have reason to be proud of their children. The Sisters are very tired and they are deserving of a restful vacation.\n\nThe promotion list is ready and I fear some classes will be very overcrowded. At the reopening of school in September I shall communicate with you concerning the changes required.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 6, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, reporting on the results achieved by the pupils of the Caughnawaga Village Schools during the past year and enclosing a newspaper clipping regarding same.

The results speak eloquently of the devotion of the Rev. Sisters and of the application to their studies on the part of the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I am further pleased to learn of the success, as shown by the splendid display of needle work.\n\nI desire to extend the thanks of the Department to yourself and the Rev.

Q.\nOttawa, August 19, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nPursuant to your conversation of today with the Superintendent of Indian Education, I have to inform you that the Department approves of instruction in French language at the Caughnawaga Indian Day School, from Standard 4 on. It is clearly understood, however, that French will be taught as a subject not more than one hour per school day and that English is the language of instruction. The Sister Superior may requisition for suitable elementary texts in due course. For the time being, the Department considers it inadvisable to give instruction in French language to the Continuation Class.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6075, file 305-1, part 2)\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that in spite of amicable advices given by the Reverend Sister Superior of the Caughnawaga R.C. Schools and of Constable Jocks, to the non-catholics living in the surroundings of the St-Ann's School in the Village of Caughnawaga, these people persist in disturbing the peace at night when they trespass upon the R.C. property of St-Ann's school and uses the playground at their good will. They take hold of the equipment and tear down the fence around that school. When called upon by Rev. Sister Superior they have used insulting language towards her and laugh at her. I beg to ask that instructions be given by the Department to Constable Jocks, of Caughnawaga, in order that this disturbance ceases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Superintendent of Education\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSeptember 16, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has been informed by the Indian Agent that persons living near the St. Ann's School in the village of Caughnawaga, have been disturbing the peace at night trespassing upon St. Ann's School property, tearing down fences and committing other damage and also using insulting language to the Reverend Sister Superior.\n\nPlease take all necessary measures to have these disturbances stopped.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nConstable J.K. Jocks,\nCaughnawaga,\nQue.\nSeptember 16, 1926.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant with reference to the disturbances in the neighbourhood of St. Ann's School at Caughnawaga and I have written to Constable Jocks on the subject as requested therein.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean.\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nQue.\nOttawa, October 1, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that I purpose visiting Caughnawaga on Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning next. Mr. Chene will be with me on Tuesday morning. The intention is to study the accommodation of the schools on the reserve and to examine possible building sites. I do not know that it will be necessary for you to assist, but I write to let you know of my plans and I shall be very glad to see you if it is convenient for you to be on the reserve at that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nP. Q.\nOttawa, October 1, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nI wish to inform you that it is my intention to make a brief visit to the Caughnawaga Day Schools on Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning, next. On Monday, I wish to study the question of accommodation that is required for both your school and the Protestant one. On Tuesday morning, Mr. Chene of this Department and myself hope to look at possible building sites.\n\nIt is possible that Constable Jocks will be needed on Monday afternoon to answer questions concerning the identity of children, and I should be grateful if you would have him hold himself in readiness to assist at that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Rose Alma,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Day Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nOttawa, October 1, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nI wish to inform you that it is my intention to make a brief visit to the Caughnawaga Day Schools on Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning, next. On Monday, I wish to study the question of accommodation that is required for both your school and the Protestant one. On Tuesday morning, Mr. Chene of this Department and myself hope to look at possible building sites.\n\nIt is possible that Constable Jocks will be needed on Monday afternoon to answer questions concerning the identity of children, and I should be grateful if you would have him hold himself in readiness to assist at that time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Q.\nOctober 19, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nI wish to report on my recent visit to the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day School. I made a special study of the question of accommodation that is needed for this activity. At present, classes are conducted in four buildings: 1. the Girls' School; 2. the Boys' School; 3. the former Protestant School; 4. the building we are renting. As we hope to release the third mentioned building for Protestant Day School next year and as the rented building is wholly unsuitable, I gave first attention to the best use of the accommodation in the two brick buildings, the Boys' and the Girls' Schools. Four classes can be accommodated in the Girls' building if the roof is raised. The rooms on the second floor of the Boys' School are not suitable for classroom purposes and can be used for typewriting and domestic science. The classrooms on the first floor are quite suitable. The two old buildings, therefore, look after six classes, but ten classrooms are required, as follows:\n\nFirst Grade - 2 classrooms,\nSecond Grade - 2 \"\nThird Grade - 2 \"\nFourth Grade - 1 classroom,\nFifth Grade - 1 \"\nSixth Grade - 1 \"\nContinuation - 1 \"\n\nThis means, of course, coeducation practically throughout the whole school. It is true that there are two classrooms for each of the three first grades; but my suggestion to the Sister Superior was that they have boys and girls in each and divide the reserve so that the little children would be studying in the closest buildings.\n\nThe Sister Superior has lately written that she believes a still further classroom is necessary, due to the large increase expected in the continuation group for the academic year 1927-28. I have answered her letter, pointing out that it might be possible to organize the work so that the extra room would not be needed.\n\nIn addition to the ten classrooms, a domestic science room and a typewriting room, the school should have an auditorium. As four classrooms and an auditorium are required in the new building, this suggested to Mr. Chene a two storey building with four classrooms on one floor and an auditorium on the other. The small room might be set off as an office. When it is known exactly what accommodation is really necessary, I shall prepare another memorandum. The September enrolment and average attendance of 322 and 311, respectively, indicates that ten classrooms is the minimum accommodation required.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6075, file 305-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 27, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nWith reference to your conversation with Mr. Chene, I wish to state that you are authorized to visit the Department office in Ottawa some time in the near future. The Department will allow transportation costs of yourself and one other Sister. Please write to Mr. Ferrier, indicating the date of your visit, so that he will be free to discuss with you questions relative to the education of the Indian children at Caughnawaga.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Rose Alma,\nPrincipal,\nR. C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI have many subjects to discuss concerning the schools and the education of the Indian children. I am most thankful to the Department for granting me the favor of visiting your office. There are knotty problems to solve and I need your advice.\n\nI am beginning the semi-annual examinations Mon. Dec. 6th, therefore this is my only week free, so if convenient for you, I shall be at your office Thurs. Dec. 2nd.\n\nAwaiting the pleasure of meeting you and the Officials of the Department,\n\nI am,\n\nYours gratefully,\nSister Mary Rose Alma,\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier\nSuperintendent of Indian Education\nOttawa.\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nDecember 24th, 1926\n\nIt is a duty and a pleasure at the same time to send with the last reports of the year, congratulations in behalf of the work done in the Indian Day Schools of Caughnawaga. The Reverend Sisters have devoted themselves with untiring zeal and assuredly their efforts are blessed with success. Instruction and education are closely followed with the best results. Economy is taught and put in practice, discipline and order reigns in all the classes.\n\nAll this is an encouragement for the Department as well as a mark of appreciation for all that is done for their welfare.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that yesterday when visiting the various classes at the Caughnawaga Boys School, I had to point out to several of the older pupils who have been insubordinates since a few weeks, that they will not be tolerated after the 25th instant, when, as I have told them, an Officer will come from the Department to investigate into their case.\n\nOf course, I have only wished to intimidate them, however, as I have been informed by Mr. Inspector C. C. Parker that he intends to visit the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve on this very same day of the 25th instant, I beg to ask you whether you would permit Mr. Parker, if it is also possible for him, to visit the Boys' school for the simple reason to impress upon these children, and I feel certain that this will prove of a good effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nFebruary 28, 1927.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Perrier,\n\nIn accordance with your request, I visited the Boys' School at Caughnawaga on Friday last and took up with them some matters of discipline. Before doing so I had a long talk with the Sister Superior, who advised me fully as to the matters of complaint. I trust that the advice I gave them will have the desired effect.\n\nI might add that visiting these schools is, to an officer of this Department, a real pleasure. The general atmosphere of the schools is exceptionally good, the attendance is large and the pupils bright and intelligent in appearance. The teachers appear to be all that could be desired and there is every evidence of excellent work being done. I am glad to have been able, even in a small way, to lend them what assistance I could.\n\nInspector.\nMarch 22, 1927.\n\nMEMO RE EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY ON THE CAUGHNAWAGA INDIAN RESERVE\n\nCaughnawaga Village R. C.\n\nThis day school activity is conducted in four separate buildings, two of which have several classrooms by the Sisters of St. Ann. There are 12 Sisters and 3 lay workers in our service. The enrolment for the past fiscal year was 351 and the average attendance, 285.\n\nCaughnawaga Bush R. C.\n\nThis school is a one-classroomed affair, on the outskirts of the village and is conducted by a lay worker. The enrolment is 30 and the average attendance, 25.\n\nSt. Isidore R. C.\n\nAnother one-roomed school, on the outskirts of the village, conducted by a lay worker; enrolment - 16; average attendance - 14.\n\nThe total enrolment at the Roman Catholic schools of the village is 397, with an average attendance of 324, or 81.3 percentage of attendance - a very creditable record. The Department of Indian Affairs considers this day school activity one of the most efficient in Canada. The Catholic work has been conducted without break for about a hundred years. Part of this time the Government did not pay any grant. The Sisters of St. Ann have been in charge the last twelve years. There is now in operation a well attended class for high school and commercial students.\n\nProtestant School\n\nA one-roomed school in the village with an enrolment of 34 and an average attendance of 24. This school was formerly conducted by the Methodist Church. The Government commenced grants in 1899. In 1919, it was closed.\nfor lack of attendance. In 1924, there was an urgent request for the re-opening of a Protestant school, and one which is undenominational in character was commenced. The class is conducted in the Methodist Church building, as the school formerly used for Protestant purposes was required in 1920 to take care of the increasing enrolment at the R.C. school.\n\nIt is the intention to conduct Catholic work on this reserve in only five buildings - the two on the outskirts of the village at St. Isidore and Bush and three brick buildings in the village, two were erected some years ago and it is proposed to build the third in 1927. The old Protestant classroom building will then be released for the present Protestant school activity.\nSt. Constant, Que.,\nMarch 31st, 1927\n(Caughnawaga Agency)\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I am sending, under separate covers, the quarterly school reports which are very gratifying.\n\nThe attendance is excellent although the number of pupils is not as great as last year. More families leave the Reserve for the winter months, seeking employment in the United-States and many in Lachine Que. The children who live in Lachine during the winter do not as a rule, attend school, so naturally when they leave in October and return in April they cannot follow the pupils, therefore, they are a real nuisance and a drawback besides being a burden to the teacher. Some of those pupils are thirteen years old and have had but only the first and the two last months of each year in school, since they are seven. Can any means be taken to force them to attend school in Lachine during the winter months?\n\nEverything concerning the schools and the children is running in perfect harmony. The pupils are fast developing into studies, well-bred, trustworthy children. What a change within ten years. I firmly believe that only teachers who are religious can transform and mould characters with as much success.\n\nMr. Russell T. Perrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nI trust that the new school will be large enough to accommodate the wants of the school curriculum. The Boys' school should be used for the children who attend the primary classes No. 1 - 2 - 3 at the east end of the village, therefore, the entire course will have its classes in the main part of the village.\n\nThe Girls' School used for the Continuation School and six classes in the new building.\n\nUpon this suggestion to me by Reverend Sister Superior, I advised her to write to the Department as she understands the needs of the schools more than I do.\n\nSpring is already here and nothing yet seems to indicate a new school for the next scholastic year, and assuredly it is pressing.\n\nWe can not longer use the Sacred Heart School property leased which ends in August. It would require many repairs which would cost over $100.00, and then it will not be suitable. It is too old, the wood is rotten.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, April 4, 1927.\n\nMy Dear Sir,\n\nAbout a week ago, I handed over to Mr. Letourneau the quarterly reports which I hope you will find satisfactory. The attendance is gratifying, the pupils are more docile, application is better, cleanliness remarkable for Indian children.\n\nYears of experience have proved that cultural work especially in the primary classes, doubles the child's ability and makes him love education and study. This explains why so many are eager to acquire higher education.\n\nIt pleases me to tell you that the General Prefect of Studies of our Order has been here since last Thursday making minute examinations in all the classes. The results so far are much beyond her expectations.\n\nMay I ask if the Department has decided to erect a new school? If the matter is settled, would you please let me know as I am handicapped in many ways, especially concerning the teachers required for the next academic year as all application for new teachers should be made before the 15th of April. I hope that the land near the Girls' School will be chosen as it is far preferable to the one near the Boys' School.\n\nAn early reply shall be greatly appreciated by\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 8th, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nYour letter of the 4th instant received, and I am very pleased to note that the Prefect of Studies of your Order has found, upon an examination of the classes, that such excellent results have been achieved. Your quarterly reports have been received, and it is noted that there has been a splendid average attendance throughout that period.\n\nI may say that it is the intention of the Department to proceed with the erection of a new school building this coming summer, and we are at present arranging to obtain the land necessary for the site and for playgrounds. The site selected is near the girls' school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Farrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Rose Almu,\nPrincipal,\nR. C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, April 21, 1927.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nOur experience in trying to give the girl graduates of Caughnawaga a higher education demonstrated that the secluded life of the Boarding-School is not compatible with the mode of living of the Indians, consequently only one girl out of seven given the opportunity of an advanced course, was able to complete one year. The others discontinued on account of ill health, therefore I am attempting to ask the Department to add another class to the Continuation School. It would be a stimulant and an impetus to progress, besides it would be an encouragement to the studious intelligent girls who have finished their course in our school and who are not yet fifteen years old. Why not give them an advantage to procure a professional diploma. It will be an innovation well appreciated by the greater number of the Band.\n\nI feel confident that a two years' course will be quite sufficient to obtain a Quebec Academic Diploma with first honors.\n\nTrusting you will give this appeal your earnest consideration, I am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Rose Alma\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 28, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to a second continuation class at the Caughnawaga Indian Day School. I believe that we should make haste slowly in this connection and wish to suggest that the matter be the subject of a conference after the new building has been erected and its accommodation tested. If the extra class can be started and there are a sufficient number of pupils to warrant it, it might be advisable to give it a trial some months from now, if we find there is room available for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Rose Alma,\nPrincipal,\nR. C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nExtract from letter of Mr. Agent Letourneau,\nDated April 30th, 1927.\n\nOriginal on File #5-1-5.\n\nIt would be advisable to have the closing exercises of the schools for the coming summer holidays to take place on or about the 17th of June. These exercises would then take place in a rather private way. The only distribution of prizes that would be required for the graduates would approximately cost $20.00 instead of a sum of $105.00 as the previous year, making a total saving of $220.00.\n\nFurthermore, I am informed that a few of the Reverend Sisters presently teaching at the various schools of Caughnawaga are just preparing their examination for a Higher Grade, which is to take place on the 18th and the 20th of June, next.\n\nFor these reasons, I beg to recommend that the closing exercises will take place on the 17th of June.\nOttawa, May 5th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 30th ultimo recommending that the Indian schools in the Village of Caughnawaga be closed for the coming summer holidays on June 17th, next, I beg to say that, for the reasons stated by you, the Department will approve of these schools being closed on that date. The closing of these schools in this instance is not to form a precedent for other years, as it is expected that all schools will be conducted for the full period in each year.\n\nPlease inform the Rev. Sister Superior of the approval granted for the closing of the schools on the 17th proximo, in order that she can make the necessary arrangements in due time for the holding of the closing exercises.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nOutremont, May 22, 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find the examination in English Composition and Typewriting of the Senior Continuation Class. \"A news letter to a distant friend.\"\n\nThey were written on the spur of the moment and under the stress of an examination. The reading of them may be a pleasant distraction and may help you to form an opinion. You will note how your composition on Confederation is uppermost in their minds.\n\nThey are all rated, so I am finished with them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n22 Robert Ave.\n\nRussell T.

I am very happy and proud to have won it.\n\nWith renewed expressions of thanks, I beg to remain, dear Sir,\n\nYours very gratefully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nViola Jacks.\nSt-Constant, Que.,\nJune 23rd, 1927\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to say that the school teachers' reports for the last quarter were sent to the Department under separate cover.\n\nThis year has been remarkable for its regular attendance, and the gratifying results obtained in the examinations given by the Prefect of Study, the Inspector and the Principal.\n\nProgress is fast increasing. Strangers are amazed at the intelligence and attitude of the children. Their politeness is striking. All this is due to the hard work and indefatigable zeal of the devoted Sisters, who are deserving of praise for their splendid work. My appreciation of the work done in the schools differ from that of Mr. Peter J. Delisle, of Caughnawaga, who a few weeks ago, after reading the said-to-be encouraging letter sent to the chief councillor concerning the new school, commented it and passed his own remarks, among which was one especially noticeable, that he saw no progress on the reserve since the Sisters had charge of the schools. Learning was at a standstill.\n\nThe Commencement Exercises, altho private, had its usual stamp of refinement. The singing, recitations, and valedictory were rendered admirably well. One would have thought that the English language was their mother tongue. The children are a credit to the Department and to their school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. Superintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, June 28th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, relative to the reports which you forwarded for the June quarter from the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Schools. The Department is pleased to note that gratifying results have been obtained in the various examinations of the pupils during the year.\n\nThe thanks of the Department is tendered to the Rev. Sister Superior and the Sisters associated with her for their devotion to the interests of the children in the school. Much progress has resulted in the education of the Indian youth of the Caughnawaga Reserve since the Sisters assumed charge of the teaching services on this Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Q.\nAugust 10, 1927.\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nI had entertained the hopes of having an interview with you and to settle many important and pressing matters concerning the schools at Caughnawaga, but your letter of July 27th disappoints me and leaves me in a puzzling situation.\n\nEvidently the new school will not be ready for many months and you are aware that our former St. Ann's School and the rented school house are no longer to be used by us, therefore taking away three class rooms. Where shall we teach?\n\nOur decision of co-operation throughout the classes necessitates some change in the girls' school especially, and unless immediate attention is given to the work, it will be utterly impossible to start school at the beginning of the term. Several other questions need to be discussed before I organize the classes for the next school term.\n\nShould it be impossible for you to come to Caughnawaga, I would rather sacrifice a day or so and go to Ottawa than delay the opening of school.\n\nAwaiting an early reply, I am my dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Rosaline,\nPrincipal.\n\nMr Russell Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 13, 1927.\n\nDear Sister Mary Rose Alma:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, and I note you are troubled concerning the commencement of the academic year. It may be necessary to convene only some of the classes. Other children may have to take an enforced holiday. It may be advisable to continue the rental of the Indian house that we were using. You should discuss this with Mr. Letourneau at the first opportunity. When Mr. Chene is on the Reserve, please draw to his attention the fact that the girls' school building will have to be altered immediately. I may find an opportunity to go to Caughnawaga for a day or so towards the end of the month, but as there are questions that should be discussed without delay, it might be advisable for you to come to Ottawa. The Department will be glad to pay the expenses of yourself and another Sister.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Rose Alma,\nSupervising Principal,\nIndian Day Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nOttawa, August 18, 1927.\n\nDear Sister Mary Rose Alma:\n\nPursuant to our conversation of yesterday, I have to request that you will make the best arrangements possible for the use of the Cloud house for a few months for school purposes. You should also approach Mr. Indian Agent Letourneau with a view to assisting in this connection and for the purpose of learning whether he could allow his office to be used for one classroom. A half-day system for the classes that are using these two buildings should be instituted until such time as the new central school is ready for occupation.\n\nI consider it advisable to postpone the proposed re-grouping along co-educational lines of the Indian classes. This action should be taken immediately prior to the occupation of the new central school. At that time, I shall be glad to proceed to Caughnawaga to co-operate with you in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nIn view of the large number of children between the ages of 10 and 15 years who are already graduates of the Caughnawaga schools and to whom no further education seems available, I would most strongly suggest to the Department to arrange to have a first year high school course for these children. I am sure the Department can easily arrange with the teaching sisters here to have such a course commence next week in order not to lose any time.\n\nI am a strong advocate for the higher education of my race because I know that it is only in education that the future Indians will be made and that it is in the foundation thereof laid that our Indians will be able to fulfill the duties of citizenship hereon.\n\nBecause I know the Department would not like these children roaming about the streets and forgetting all the education they have already received, I am sure the Department will take the necessary action to give these children a chance to get a higher education such as a high school course would give.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. H. Jacobs, B.A., M.D. (megis)\nmedical officer.\nOttawa, September 2, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, urging the establishment of a continuation class for high school study in connection with the Caughnawaga R.

Education will always be the best investment which the Department can make for my people.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ.M. Jacobs M.D.\nI beg to inform you that since the recent opening of the Caughnawaga Indian Day Schools, a few Indian women have often taken the liberty to abruptly enter the classrooms and to furiously address their insulting phrases to the Sisters in charge of their respective rooms.\n\nFor the simple reason of discipline which I have frequently noted amongst the pupils, I beg to recommend that instruction be given by the Department to the Truant-Officer in order that these women may be into the impossibility to freely enter and disturb the usual quietness of the Schools. These women only intention is to give the teachers their personal views as to the manner that their children have to be directed and left free from being rebuked by the Reverend Sisters.\n\nThe following attached note is a specimen of the mental character of some of the Indian women, when they were kindly requested by the Reverend Sister Guerier to fill in a blank form in order to keep an exact record of the present inscription of the pupils at the different R.S. Schools on the Reserve.\n\nWhat in a hell you wont to sign my name for? I'll sign my name when ever I'll feel like it. It's better for you not to ask again.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nMr. Superintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, September 30, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, relative to the difficulty which the Sisters of the Caughnawaga Day Schools are experiencing in the case of the Indian women who enter their classrooms and make insulting remarks to them.\n\nYou should take this matter up with Constable Jocks, and inform him that he is to see that the Sisters are not interrupted in their classroom activities by the Indian women or others. The Constable should notify any disturbers that they are to cease using abusive remarks to the teachers or interfering with the classroom work in any way or serious notice will be taken if the offence is repeated. It is thought that if Constable Jocks takes a strong stand in matters of this nature and co-operates with the Rev. Sisters that there will be no further complaints regarding the Indian women disturbing them in their classroom work by their visits to the classrooms.\n\nIn any cases where the parents refuse to give the information asked for by the Rev. Sister Superior regarding the name, age and parentage of a child, she should request Constable Jocks to obtain same.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of this communication, which you should hand to Constable Jocks with the request that he give the matter his usual efficient attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you on behalf of the Reverend Sister Superior of the Caughnawaga Indian Day Schools that one of the Indian Pupils named Peter Dailleboust, 3rd year, 12 years of age, and the son of Jos. Dailleboust and of Therese Norton, is an insubordinate or an idiot. This boy is almost intolerable into its class-room. He is strong and healthy; it is probably due to his strength that he occasionally try to strike the Reverend teacher with his fist. The Sister Superior have sent him before me a few times since over a year ago, but, in spite of my efforts to persuade him to behave himself, he do not seem to have any better dispositions.\n\nI do not know whether his parents would be willing to send their son at some other institution. I am informed that they could not pay any expenses incurred with a better education of this boy.\n\nAs I am unable to make any recommendation in the present case, I beg to leave this question to your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Day School.\n\nI have to request that you will inform the Department on the disciplinary measures which the Rev. Sisters have already taken in his case other than having him appear before you. It is considered that the staff of the school should be able to carry out the necessary discipline in the case of a boy of this age. You should also state whether this boy is mentally deficient. The Department is not prepared at the present time to have him sent to a residential school, as it is thought, if strong action is taken, it should be possible for the Rev.

It is thought that such an appointment would have a good effect on the lives of these children, particularly if the right type of teacher was secured. His activity would be under your supervision.

Sister Mary Rose Alma,\nSupervising Principal,\nIndian Day Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith the Caughnawaga R.C. Indian Day school Reports for the second quarter which I presume you will find most satisfactory. I am pleased to add that the Catholic Schools on the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve are well attended, the discipline is excellent and that the children's progress is remarkable. I have only praise to write of the Reverend Sisters who conduct these schools because of their painstaking devotedness and interest towards their pupils.\n\nI regret the false reports which are lodged against them, for only religious teachers could have the patience to succeed with Iroquois children. Despite the Resolution to the contrary, No 369, passed by the Caughnawaga Indian Council at their meeting of the 5th instant, I would suggest that the same Sisters be kept in charge of all the schools, especially of the younger boys to the age of twelve, who always need a woman's training and care.\n\nIf the Department should decide to pass over the older boys to male teachers, my experience with Indians Affairs convince me that only a religious Order of men can handle the situation.\n\nAgain, Resolution No 369 is false in stating that Higher Arithmetic is not taught, for the 2nd year Class.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nof the Continuation School completes Business Arithmetic.\n\nAsking you to give due consideration to these weighty questions before making any change in the present school system at Caughnawaga, I am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing the December quarter returns of the Caughnawaga R.C. Indian Day Schools. The Department is pleased to note the regular attendance and that the children are making good progress in their studies.\n\nRelative to Resolution No. 369 of the Caughnawaga Council as to employing male teachers for the older boys, I beg to say that the Department is taking up this matter with Rev. Sister Mary Rose Alma, Supervising Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nBy this time you have received the school reports which I trust you found satisfactory. So far the teachers as well as myself have every reason to be contented with the work of the pupils. Their behavior with very few exceptions is good. One great disturbance is that a large number of families have moved to Lachine and to the States for the winter months. Most of these pupils will come back in March without having attended school; consequently they will be a drawback to the classes.\n\nDuring the first months of the school term, I had considerable trouble with some of the French children of St. Isidore Road School. Their parents were prejudiced against the teacher and made her task unbearable. I visited the school often and gave her every assistance possible. As Mr. Jocks is seldom home, I played the part of truant-officer and went to see the parents who live at the far end of the Reserve. Nothing could convince them of their false judgments, and as they were determined to hold their own opinion and continue to make trouble I was forced to report the case to the Agent who settled them with a fine. Now peace reigns in the school and the teacher can control her pupils and command respect.\n\nThe Christmas trees in all the classrooms were beautifully decorated and all our children were the happy recipients of gifts made by their teachers. Moreover each had a bag of candy donated by several of our friends who are much interested in our little charges. All left for their Christmas holidays with faces beaming and hearts overflowing with joy.\n\nWishing you and all the Officials of the Department best wishes for the New Year, I am,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSister Mary Rose Anna\nPrincipal\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSt. Anne's Convent\nCaughranaga, P.E.I.\nDec. 31, 1927\n\nMy dear [signature],\n\nI am sorry to inform you that part of the fence in front of the Residence was torn down last night. Scantling and pickets were broken into kindling wood and thrown around. Do you blame us for not wanting Indians as caretakers? We never know what stunt they will do next.\n\nAngus Williams came today and spoke to me of his interview with you and Mr. Scott. I am rather in an embarrassing position as what to answer concerning his sister because he is aware of the contents of your letter to me.\n\nI wish I could meet you, I need to make known to you many things concerning the schools and your help means so much to me.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You understand so well our situation. May I expect a wire?\n\nYours very truly,\nSister M. Rose Anna.\n\nTelegraph to come back Mar 9th\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI have given serious reflection and consideration to your letter of December 21st in which you asked if it would be advisable to employ a male teacher for the instruction of the more advanced boys attending the Caughnawaga Indian Day Schools. I have examined the question from every educational point of view and really do not consider it advisable nor worth while expending money for a male teacher for a handful of boys who continue their course. When the Continuation School numbers twelve boys, it is a large class. Most Iroquois boys are eager to discontinue their schooling on their fifteenth birthday, that accounts for the small number of boys in the upper classes.\n\nThe insinuation of the Councillors that Higher Arithmetic is not taught is very false. The inclosed marks obtained by the pupils of the upper classes at the semi-annual examinations of the General Prefect of Studies of our Order, two weeks ago, will reveal the truth.\n\nMy opinion is that if the Department opened a College course on the Reserve, then that would have a good effect on the lives of those boys who having completed the course of studies in our schools would be under the care and training of male teachers for a number of years. My experience with Iroquois boys convince me that only a religious order of men can face the situation and make it a success. If a decision to that effect should take place, many changes would be required all around: schools, habitation, teaching staff of Sisters.\n\nBefore taking a final decision, do you not think an interview to discuss such important matter would be much more satisfactory to the Department and to myself.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. A.F.

A.\nJanuary 7, 1928.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nPursuant to conversation with Sister Mary Rose Alma, of the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day School, it will be necessary to arrange for the appointment of one male drill instructor at an approximate annual stipend of $300 - appointment to date from September first, next. When the new building is ready for occupation, there will also be required a Sister for the instruction of domestic science and one for the academic class of the continuation school. Arrangements have been made with the Provincial Department of Education for the granting of elementary teachers' diplomas in Caughnawaga. Salaries at the rate of $850 each should be voted for these two Sisters.\nA meeting of the council is held this evening Feb 21st 1928 at the council hall, under the presidency of the Indian agent.\n\nAt its meeting of the 27th December 1927 instant, the council at the request of the band resolved to make known to the Deputy Supt. Gen. of Indian Affairs, that it is the earnest desire of parents of boys that while teachers be employed to teach them. The council therefore again at the request of the parents do approach the Deputy Supt. Gen., that he again take into careful consideration, unbiased by any religious or political influence, our desire that our boys on leaving school shall take up the occupation of agricultural steel instruction, and it is to their advantage that they be taught accordingly.\n\nWithout doubt the Deputy Supt. Gen. is of the same thought.\n\nTeachers outside of the friars or brothers.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The innovation stirred up the dormant brains of many.\n\nAn unexpected large number responded to the invitation of continuing their course, but as accommodations were limited, only nine could be accepted. The others went away reluctantly with the promise of joining the class next September. All mean business, they have plunged into their work with unusual zeal and Iroquois. They are grateful for the privilege of studying for a teacher's diploma; they need no supervising nor urging so it makes that class easy to manage. I am inclosing their first contest that you may judge of their work. You need not return the papers, as I have kept the results.\n\nMany pupils in the lower classes especially, are sick with the measles.\n\nWe are anxious for the spring, because that means the return of about forty pupils who are in Lachine or in the States.\n\nAll is running smoothly. May I please have leave of absence from March 7th to the 17th to attend the annual retreat at Lachine. I shall arrange for the proper management of the schools during my absence.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister M. Rose Ahmad\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 1st, 1928.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, relative to the opening of the academic course. It is noted that 9 pupils have been accepted, this being the full number for which accommodation could be provided.\n\nRelative to your request for leave of absence from March 7th to 17th to attend the annual retreat at Lachine, I have to say that this is approved. It is understood that you will arrange for the proper management of the schools during your absence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

Ferrier Dept. of Indian Education at his coming visit to our reserve, regarding several matters of the utmost importance to the welfare of the band such as a discussion on the employment of male teachers for boys, employment of members of the band as school janitors, curriculum of studies prescribed, the hours of opening and closing schools, holidays and holydays, and other matters in which parents demand justification.\nOttawa, April 5, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of Resolution No. 380 of the Caughnawaga Council, requesting that council be given an opportunity to have an interview with the Superintendent of Indian Education upon the occasion of his intended visit. In this connection I beg to say that Mr. Ferrier will give you several days' notice as to the date he will be in Caughnawaga, and, if you consider it advisable, you may arrange to call a meeting of council for the afternoon of the day he is there. This, however, you can arrange after you have received definite word as to the date of his visit. I might say the various matters mentioned in the resolution can then be discussed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL.

You would have facts to produce and could give your opinion of the discipline, methods used, success, improvement and whatever you may think fit to say to enlighten and convince the prejudiced Indians.\n\nMost of our pupils are back from Lachine, and as usual quite a number did not attend school since last October. What a problem to classify those children and what a disturbance to the whole class. The attendance, punctuality, politeness, obedience, and cleanliness are very good; application in general, good. Our next ennui is the opening of the Tanawaki Golf Club, where our boys act as caddies.\n\nIt gratifies me to tell you I was most pleased with my visit to St. Isidore Road School last week. The school was very clean, and the twenty-three children present all so neat.

C'est pour r\u00e9unir la population int\u00e9ress\u00e9e de cette \u00e9glise que l'on vient d'organiser une int\u00e9ressante tombola.\n\nLes divertissements seront multiples et diff\u00e9rents. \u00c0 elle seule, la grande figuration indienne, le \"paissant\" sera toute une r\u00e9v\u00e9lation pour le public. Les indiens danseront au son des tambours, leur fameuse danse de guerre et cette danse, mieux connue, dite \"du soleil\". On imitera aussi les c\u00e9r\u00e9monies des pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs mariages et aux enterrements indiens.\n\nCette tombola aura lieu le 21 et le 22 septembre. Ces deux jours seront des jours de f\u00eates et de animations de choses int\u00e9ressantes, diff\u00e9rentes et curieuses ne devront pas manquer cette tombola.\n\nTous les grands bateaux fluviaux font la navette entre Lachine et Caughnawaga et quittent la 33e avenue \u00e0 toutes les heures : des yachts sont aussi \u00e0 la disposition du public \u00e0 la 46e avenue. Comme le projet de canonisation de Catherine Tekakwitha est commenc\u00e9 sous la direction du P\u00e8re Wynne de New York, nous sommes certains que personne ne refusera une \u00e9chole pour que l'\u00e9glise soit magnifique, qui abritera les restes mortels d'une sainte.\nOTTAWA - September 18, 1928.\n\nL.

Q.\nOttawa, November 7, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Inspector Cuddihy believes there is some doubt as to the amount of time which should be given to instruction in French language at the Caughnawaga Indian Day School. He suggests that I write to you regarding the Department's wishes. May I quote in part from official letter to Mr. Indian Agent Letourneau of August 19, 1926:\n\n\"I have to inform you that the Department approves of instruction in French language at the Caughnawaga Indian Day School, from Standard 4 on. It is clearly understood, however, that French will be taught as a subject not more than one hour per school day and that English is the language of instruction. The Sister Superior may requisition for suitable elementary texts in due course. For the time being, the Department considers it inadvisable to give instruction in French language to the Continuation Class.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Rose Alma,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nOttawa, November 17, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information and guidance, copy of official letter of today's date to the Principal of the Caughnawaga Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nP. Q.\nOttawa, November 17, 1928.\n\nMadam:\n\nThe Director of Medical Services informs me he understands that some of the children attending the Caughnawaga Indian Day School report as early as 8 A.M. The Department considers this practice might be inimical to the health of these pupils, if continued, particularly during the months of October to April, inclusive. Our regulations indicate that the school daily session shall commence at 9 o'clock, and the Department would be grateful if the Caughnawaga School would conform.\n\nI may say the Department is proud of the progress that the pupils are making at the schools under your direction. It should be kept in mind, however, that academic attainment must not be achieved at the expense of the health of the pupils. For this reason only, it is necessary for the Department to write this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Rose Alma,\nSupervising Principal,\nR.C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nSt. Ann's Convent,\nCaughnawaga, Nov.17, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just read a letter written by Dr. Jacobs to Mr. Letourneau asking that school opens at 9 o'clock.\n\nWhen I visited the Department on August 21st, I made known to you the change of hours concerning our classes, but the inclosed time tables may help you before taking a decision.\n\nOne of the principal reasons that urged each teacher to supervise her own pupils for study is that many of our advanced pupils begged us to have study from 8 o'clock to 8.30 in the classrooms to facilitate home work and memory lessons. Most homes are small, and it is utterly impossible to study -- four or five around a table with a dim light and disturbed by the cries of small children and the loud speaking of a whole family.\n\nAlthough a sacrifice for us, it is well repaid because our pupils desirous of knowledge, and ambitious in their school work are grateful and profit of the great advantage of one half hour study before class. Their efforts are crowned by notable success.\n\nDuring this terrible siege of sickness on the Reserve, be assured that we will watch over our pupils with vigilance and prudence and hope that no case of death will be registered. There is nothing alarming so far and all means possible have been taken to prevent contagion.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSister Mary Rose Alma\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n**TIME TABLE**\n\n| Time       | Activity                                      |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **A.M.**   |                                               |\n| 8:00 - 8:30| Study for higher classes                      |\n| 8:30 - 9:45| Class                                        |\n| 9:45 -10:00| Recess                                       |\n| 10:00 -11:10| Class                                      |\n| 11:10 -11:15| Closing Exercises                          |\n| **P.M.**   |                                               |\n| 1:00 - 2:15| Class                                        |\n| 2:15 - 2:30| Recess                                       |\n| 2:30 - 3:35| Class                                        |\n| 3:35 - 3:40| Closing Exercises                           |\n| 3:40 - 3:55| Cleaning from Grade III. up.                 |\n\n**GRADE I. and PRIMARY**\n\n| Time       | Activity                                      |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **A.M.**   |                                               |\n| 8:30 - 9:45| Class with intermission at 9 for Singing or Calisthenics |\n| 9:45 -10:10| Recess                                       |\n| 10:10 -11:05| Class                                    |\n| 11:05 -11:10| Closing Exercises                         |\n| **P.M.**   |                                               |\n| 1:00 - 2:15| Class                                        |\n| 2:15 - 2:50| Recess                                       |\n| 2:50 - 3:25| Class                                        |\n| 3:25 - 3:30| Closing Exercises                           |\nDear Mr. Letourneau;\n\n(1) In view of the prevalence of contagious diseases on the reservation I wish to recommend that all the school children be vaccinated at the expense of the Department.\n\n(2) As another useful measure for the preservation of coughs and colds among the school children, I wish to recommend that classes should start at 9 a.m. instead of 8 a.m. as it is at present for the following reasons; To start classes at 8 a.m. is really too early because very often the children awake in cold houses before the fires are made, walk bare-feet on their cold floors and often eat very little or nothing for breakfast, while the early hour often causes the children to rush with perspiration to the 8 o'clock classes. There are all conducive to colds and ill-health.\n\n(3) Again as health officer and Indian Agent you should not allow M. Delisle to construct his stable and barn roofs in such manner that rain and snow from off them may fall upon the play-grounds of the school near the R.C. Church as he is doing at the present time. There is no doubt that this is going to cause wet playgrounds which will also be conducive to ill-health of some school children.\n\nYours truly\n\nJ. H. Jacobs, M.D.\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter dated 14th instant from Dr. J. H. Jacobs, of Caughnawaga, a copy of which is enclosed herewith for your information.\n\nIn connection with its second paragraph, I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, together with a copy of another which you have directed to Rev. Sister Superior of the Indian day schools at Caughnawaga.\n\nAs to the third paragraph, concerning the barn roof recently constructed by Mr. Michel Delisle over the Old Fort Wall, in such manner, as stated by Dr. Jacobs, that rain and snow from off it will fall upon the play-grounds of the Kateri School, I beg to say that during the construction of this roof by Mr. Delisle, about 10 days ago, I have advised him to place a gutter under that roof in order that no rain water neither snow will fall upon the playground, he simply replied that he was going to think about it. The roof is completed and the gutters are not yet installed and I have reasons to believe that nothing will be done by Delisle unless he is compelled to do so upon a strict order from the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\n(with encl.)\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 22nd, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to the third paragraph of your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing copy of a communication which you received from Dr. J. H. Jacobs, Caughnawaga, relative to the barn constructed by Michael Delisle, it is noted that rain and snow from the roof will fall on the playgrounds of the Kateri School.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will inform Mr. Delisle that he should arrange to take the necessary steps, either by providing gutters or other attachments to the barn, to prevent the rain and snow from falling on the school grounds. The Department expects that he will give this matter his prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nSt. Ann's Convent,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nJanuary 14, 1929.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nOur school opened Jan. 7th with an attendance of 336 pupils. Several are sick with the grippe\u2014others are living in Lachine.\n\nA very great number of our pupils were out practically forty days, so you can well imagine the dreadful drawback in the schools. Nothing can remedy the situation; but with the patience and devotedness of the teachers, and the regular attendance, constant application on the part of the pupils; they can cover a good part of the year's work. Will the children co-operate and show much interest? I hope so.\n\nPupils of the St. Isidore Road School number twenty, in spite of bad roads and cold weather. Attendance is good. The Agent sent me a copy of the letter of Jan 10th stating that the Department extended the privilege of teaching French at St. Isidore Road School. I am surprised that permission was given upon a request made by someone who knows nothing of the situation.\n\nThe pupils of the country schools are exceedingly backwards because of their solitary lives in the woods and their genuine Indian mode of living. The parents are the real types and speak only Iroquois. Therefore progress means little to them. Out of twenty pupils, four only are French and they are in grades I and II. The pupils speak no English when they come to school and they are fifteen before they reach Grade IV. I advocate and encourage the teaching of French, because I know how useful and necessary nowadays to be a bilingualist, but I do not find the teaching of French practical at St. Isidore Road School.\n\nMiss Snow and Miss Philipps, our two village school teachers have a class of their own this year. Both have asked for an increase of salary since October, altho they received an increase of $50. a year starting last Sept.\nAgain last week they renewed their demand. My reply was that I would make known their request to the Department, but personally I thought they were expecting a lot for teachers who have no diplomas, classes that require little preparation, a Principal bearing all the responsibilities and the schools a few steps from their homes. Of themselves they would never have asked such a thing, but they are being influenced.\n\nI rely on you more than ever to co-operate with me in my duties as Principal.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, January 16, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to conditions at the Caughnawaga schools. I note, with regret, that considerable time has been lost because of sickness on the reserve; but I trust that interruptions from now on will be comparatively few. You refer to the extension of the privilege of teaching French to the St. Isidore and Bush Schools. Please note that this addition to the instruction is not obligatory but is left to the discretion of the teacher. In the case of the St. Isidore Road School, I note you believe the teaching of French impractical. Therefore, it is not necessary to add it to the course of studies at the present time.\n\nI regret there are no funds for the purpose of increasing the salaries of Miss Snow and Miss Phillips.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Rose Alma,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nCaughnawaga, March 18, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI must tell you now there was a great change following my children have had the same illness as their Mother and they are still under the care of Dr. Labelle of the Caughnawaga Hospital. Dr. Labelle told me to send them to school only when the weather is good but the Superior of the Convent wanted me to send her every day. So she had me served with a warrant Form No.5, Criminal Code, Indian Act, and I showed them a certificate from Dr. Labelle and now I have the idea of prosecuting the Superior and I wish to have your advice on this matter. She had the W.C. washed by my young girl with cold water and she had the class washed by my girl 9 years old who is sick, this I can prove to you, Mr. McLean, by witnesses. She had these children washing or scrubbing the classes till six O'clock at night. Hoping to receive a reply, I wish to say I am a nephew to the late Post Master Napoleon Giasson of Caughnawaga and I was candidate for his position.\n\nYours etc.\n\n(Sgd.) Arthur Meloche.\n\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nOttawa, March 26, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 15th instant relative to your complaint that your children, when ill, had to perform certain washing and scrubbing in the school buildings on the Caughnawaga Reserve, I have to say that the Department is making enquiry regarding this matter and you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Arthur Meloche,\nCaughnawaga P.Q.\nOttawa, March 26, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Arthur Meloche, Caughnawaga, stating that his two children had to wash and scrub at the request of the Sister Superior although they were ill at the time. For your information I give the following extract from Mr. Meloche's letter:\n\n\"My children have had the same illness as their Mother and they are still under the care of Dr. Labelle of the Caughnawaga Hospital. Dr. Labelle told me to send them to school only when the weather is good but the Superior of the Convent wanted me to send her every day.

She had these children washing or scrubbing the classes till six o'clock at night\".\n\nI have to request that you will enquire into this matter and furnish the Department with a report at an early date regarding the complaint of Mr. Meloche.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant relative to a complaint made to the Department against the R. C. school teachers at Caughnawaga by Arthur Meloche.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that I have investigated into this case and found that these accusations are entirely false. This is probably caused by the recent arrest of Meloche by the Truant Officer Jocks on the ground that his children are often absent from the schools. I may add that Constable Jocks will also furnish the Department with his report in this case.\n\nI beg to suggest that Arthur Meloche should be advised by the Department that in future, he must, in case of illness of his children of school age, furnish the Superior with a Medical Certificate, in order to avoid any misunderstanding to that effect. In his case, Medical Certificates were produced before me, at the inquest only, instead of the Principal.\n\nMarcel Meloche, 11 years of age, is an insubordinate who is encouraged by his father in his mischievous conduct during the only few hours of his attendance at school. It is well understood that the school children does not the washing or the scrubbing of the classes. Everyone, including the teachers have left the buildings before 4.30 P.M. every school day.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSt. Constant, P.Q.,\nMarch 30th, 1929\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that at a meeting of the Caughnawaga Indian Council, held the 28th instant, I have been requested by the Councillors to ask the Department \"what is the curriculum and what is taught\" in the schools of the Caughnawaga Reserve, and, how \"many English teachers are on the Indian Reserve.\"\n\nI leave to your consideration the question as to whether or not, it deserves a reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Superintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, April 2nd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, relative to the request of the Caughnawaga Indian Council to be informed as to the curriculum, etc., in use in the schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if you consider it advisable, you may inform the Council that the curriculum is the same as that in use in the public schools in the Province of Quebec and that all the teachers have a good knowledge of the English language and are competent to give instruction in same in the classroom.\n\nI have also your letter of the 28th ultimo, relative to the complaint of Arthur Meloche. The Department is writing this man along the lines suggested by you. It is noted that there is no foundation for his complaint.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P.Q.\nOttawa, April 2nd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 18th ultimo, in which you make a complaint against the Sister Superior of the Caughnawaga Schools, I have to say that upon enquiry the Department is of the impression that there is no foundation for your complaint. In future, in order to overcome the difficulty complained of, it is expected that, in the case of illness of any of your children of school age, you will promptly furnish the Superior with a medical certificate, which would avoid any misunderstanding as to the absence of your children through illness.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Arthur Meloche,\nCaughnawaga,\nP. Q.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit the following report concerning the Indian Day Schools of the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nYou have no doubt noticed from the different reports prepared by the different teachers for the last quarter ended March 31st last, that the average attendance was not as good as usual. There has been a great deal of sickness; there are still many cases of typhoid fever among the pupils.\n\nThe Prefect General of the Sisterhood of St. Ann's made a minute examinations in all the classes which lasted six days, and Reverend Sister Superior was happy to tell me that the results are encouraging and that the Reverend Prefect was astonished at the progress made since her last visitation a year and a half ago.\n\nAssuredly, we have every reason to appreciate the very able and efficient manner in which Rev. Sister Superior, assisted by her excellent staff, conducts and manages the schools.\n\nIt is to me a source of pleasure to watch the growth and progress of the Indians, and to know that they are, not only being well and ably taught, but that they are at the same time, being guided and assisted to seek the higher life. Their work is a credit to them and their noble calling, altho our inconstant and fault-finding Indians will not admit it exteriorly.\n\nThe school grounds would need to be made more attractive to harmonize with the clean and inviting class rooms.\n\nI beg to ask whether the Department intend keeping Mrs. A. Beauvais another year, if not, Rev. Sister Superior has an experienced teacher that could fill the position\n\n...............\n\nThe Superintendent,\nof Education, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nproviding she is notified before her term expires, July 1st.\n\nYou are aware, I believe, that the Teachers' residence for the R.C. Indian Day Schools, in the village of Caughnawaga, cannot accommodate sixteen sisters, and that they have lived in tight quarters all year. I beg to suggest that the Department would consider the proposition of a new residence, if the present house could be used for the Department to the establishment of a class in vocational training; the Indian Agent Offices, etc., which are in great need at Caughnawaga at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Superintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, April 11, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, reporting on the Indian day schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve. The Department is pleased to note that success has attended the efforts of the Reverend Sisters. Steps will be taken this year to level and prepare the grounds at the Senior School.\n\nUnder separate cover, you have been written regarding the future of the Bush School. It is possible that the services of Mrs. Beauvais should not be retained any longer. Your early attention is requested.\n\nI note your remarks concerning the accommodation in the teachers' residence; but I regret to inform you that there are no funds at the present time for a new building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL. Letounges, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nP. Q.\nSt. Ann's Convent,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nApril 13, 1929.\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nThe last quarterly report showed great difference in the average attendance in comparison with the preceding reports. With the exception of a few cases of truancy, all the absentees were out on account of sickness. About fifteen of our pupils were registered as typhoid fever patients either in the hospital or in their homes. Entire families are sick with the fever. The McGregor family, four children and the father are in the hospital. Annie, the oldest, 10 years old, pupil of Grade II, died this afternoon. Mary McGregor, her sister, 8 years, and Michael Curotte 12 years, a pupil of Grade IV, are on the danger list. We are praying that the contagion will not spread as in the case of small-pox, last fall. What a terrible year of sickness!\n\nI hear that Mrs Beauvais intends retiring from school work and I would be most happy to do all within my power to assist the Department, if it so desires, to nominate a teacher that will fill the position with satisfaction. If you recollect, I have already spoken to you of one of our former teachers who has six years experience and possesses all the qualities of a good teacher.\n\nThere is a great deal of proselytizing going on here lately, and I wonder if the Department approves of that. Our poor tickled, ignorant Indians have no will of their own and it is a cause of trouble even among our school children. I congratulate you on your firmness and righteousness in not allowing our children to change school during the scholastic year.\n\nWill the day ever come, when peace will reign in Caughnawaga.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nLester Mary Rose Alma\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 18, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the attendance at the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day School. The Department hopes that the typhoid fever is confined to those that are now suffering and that none of the cases are fatal. Mr. Letourneau has already been requested to see you concerning a successor for Mrs. Beauvais at the Bush School.\n\nI regret to learn that there is again some unrest in connection with religious questions; but you will understand that it is difficult for the Department to take any action. Our approval must be secured, however, before any children are allowed to change from one school to another, and only under most unusual circumstances would such a change be allowed during the academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Rose Alma,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Day Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P.

In future, in order to overcome the difficulty complained of, it is expected that, in the case of illness of any of your children of school age, you will promptly furnish the Superior with a medical certificate, which would avoid any misunderstanding as to the absence of your children through illness.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

They took action before finding out that illness was the cause.\n\nThe medical certificate was produced. As proof you will find the enclosed letter, what was most provoking was that they made me lose two days salary and caused me a lot of expenses and which did not bring anything out.

I should have liked to personally take greetings and to pay my respects to the Reverend Sisters of St. Ann, who have performed a great service for our Caughnawaga wards. The Department has learned that your term as Superior now comes to a close, and I may say there is a general feeling that our educational work is losing a very valuable supervisor. Please convey my thanks to all the teachers and inform them that I hope they have a pleasant vacation. The Department's continued effort to improve the school service is sufficient evidence that the children of Caughnawaga and their welfare are ever in mind. I should be grateful if you would congratulate the members of the graduating class and wish them every success for the future.\n\nTo you, personally, I should like to use the words which the Department wrote to your predecessor, Rev. Sister Mary Gabriel. May the consciousness of duty, well done, accompany you on the road to other fields of Christian activity.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Rose Alma,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Day Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nMontreal, July 6th, 1929.\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOnce again, I must report on the High efficiency of the Sisters Schools of Caughnawaga. I was accompanied during my inspection by the Reverend Pastor. The children gave very good account of themselves in the various subjects on which I questioned them. Their alertness and quickness to answer are most gratifying. They render the task of the School Inspector a pleasant one. In a few subjects the averages fell a little below the high marks of last year due to the epidemics that kept the pupils out of school for a long period. But the neatness of the pupils and the spotlessness of the classrooms - the writing copies, home work copies, drawings and maps are even better than the past.\n\nThis being the last term of Reverend Sister Rose-Alma as Superior, the Department of Education of Indian Affairs, the parents and children of Caughnawaga and the School Inspector owe her an everlasting debt of gratitude for the untiring efforts and successful administration of the Nuns' Schools.\n\nReverend Sister St-Ida is sending up a certain number of girls for the Quebec School Diploma, and I feel sure several of them will succeed. They should fit in well for Chenail and Ch\u00e9slain Schools.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSchool Inspector.\n\nTFC/M-AB.\nSt. Ann's Convent,\nCaughnawaga, P.

Your constant co-operation made light our arduous task. In trying circumstances what would we have done if we had not felt very sure that you would give us all the assistance possible.\n\nOur beautiful schools, our very comfortable and cozy home where we have all enjoyed much happiness is due to your liberality, your broad-mindedness.\n\nWhen I visited Ottawa recently I was sorry not to give you a warm shake-hand and tell you personally my grateful appreciation for all you do for the schools and for the Sisters.\n\nMay God bless all your undertakings and give you health and happiness is the heartfelt wish of\n\nYours very gratefully,\n\nSister M.

I have always taken a great personal interest in the educational work at the Caughnawaga reserve, and I can assure you that I have fully appreciated the devoted services of yourself and the Sisters associated with you in this important branch of our Indian work. I trust you will meet with the same success in any field to which you may be transferred.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev.

I admire the Sisters' Residence so recently renovated but I regret to say that it is too small for the number of teachers. I trust that in a not too distant future you will kindly consider our needs by building a convent large enough to lodge an increased staff, near to the Senior School.\n\nI deeply appreciate all improvements made, and I hope to continue the amicable relations which have always existed between the Department and the Principal of the Indian Catholic Schools of Caughnawaga.\n\nMost respectfully yours,\n\nSister Mary Francis\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Duncan C.

Voici les conclusions auxquelles nous avons cru devoir nous arr\u00eater et que je suis heureux de vous faire conna\u00eetre, assur\u00e9 \u00e0 l'avance de votre enti\u00e8re coop\u00e9ration:\n\n1- Nous croyons qu'il est opportun de s\u00e9parer gar\u00e7ons et filles. En cons\u00e9quence, nous sugg\u00e9rons que la nouvelle \u00e9cole (Acad\u00e9mique) soit exclusivement r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux filles.\n\n2- Pour les deux autres \u00e9coles, si l'une ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9serv\u00e9e exclusivement aux gar\u00e7ons, que du moins on place ceux-ci dans des classes s\u00e9par\u00e9es, except\u00e9 peut-\u00eatre pour la classe des b\u00e9b\u00e9s.\n\n3- Pour l'enseignement du fran\u00e7ais, il semble n\u00e9cessaire pour arriver \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat convenable qu'il se donne d\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e. Les enfants seront ainsi en \u00e9tat de mieux profiter des cours qui se donnent dans les classes sup\u00e9rieures.\n\nDe plus, outre l'heure inscrite au programme officiel, nous croyons que, sans manquer \u00e0 leur devoir envers le D\u00e9partement, les religieuses peuvent enseigner les mati\u00e8res secondaires, comme l'histoire, la g\u00e9ographie, l'arithm\u00e9tique, le dessin, l'enseignement m\u00e9nager, etc... dans les deux langues \u00e0 la fois. Les enfants se familiariseront ainsi, presque sans s'en apercevoir, avec les deux langues, et vous pourrez, en toute v\u00e9rit\u00e9, r\u00e9pondre au D\u00e9partement que l'enseignement se donne en anglais. Cette m\u00e9thode a fait ses preuves dans nos coll\u00e8ges de l'Ouest canadien.\n\nMonseigneur a insist\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re sp\u00e9ciale sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu'il y a pour nos enfants de Caughnawaga de bien apprendre l'anglais et le fran\u00e7ais.\n\nJ'esp\u00e8re que ce r\u00e8glement vous sera agr\u00e9able et que, donnant satisfaction \u00e0 tous les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, il permettra \u00e0 vos d\u00e9vou\u00e9es religieuses de continuer pour le plus grand bien de nos chers Iroquois leur \u0153uvre admirable d'\u00e9ducation.\n\nVeuillez agr\u00e9er, ma R\u00e9v\u00e9rende M\u00e8re, l'expression de mon religieux respect et l'assurance de mon entier d\u00e9vouement en N.-S.\n\nF.-X. Bellavance, s.j.,\nProvincial.\nTranslation\n\nMontreal Sept. 15th\n\nReverend Sister M. H\u00e9lievrie\nAssistant General\nSt. Anne's Convent, Lachine.\n\nReverend Mother:\n\nI met this morning, in company with Father Hauser, His Grace Bishop Deschamps and we studied together the school question of Bauglu-\nwaga. Here are the conclusions to which we have come to, and which I am pleased to let you know, being assured in advance of your entire cooperation.\n\n1. We believe it is opportune to separate the boys from the girls. Consequently, we suggest that the new school (Academy) be exclusively re-\nserved by for the girls.\n\n2. As to the other two schools, if one of them can not be reserved exclusively to boys, these boys should be at least placed into separate classes\nfrom the girls, perhaps in the ladies class.\n\n3. As for the teaching of French, it seems ne-\ncessary to arrive at a suitable result, that it should be done at least the first year.\nThe children will then be better prepared to draw profit from the courses given in the\nclasses of a superior degree.\n\nFurthermore, outside of the hours prescri-\nbed on the official program, we believe that without failing in their duties towards the Department, the Sisters can teach the\nsecondary subjects, such as history, geography,\narithmetic, drawing, domestic science etc.\nin both languages at the same time. The\nchildren will thus become familiarized, without\nnoticing it with both languages, and you shall be able, in all truth, to answer to the Department that the teaching is done in English. This method has given good results in our colleges of the Canadian West.\n\nHis Grace has insisted in a special manner on the necessity of our children at Caughnawaga to learn well both French and English. I hope that this regulation will be agreeable to you, and that it being satisfactory to all those interested, it will permit your devoted Sisters to continue for the good of our dear Iroquois their admirable educational work.\n\nI kindly accept, Reverend Mother, the expression of my religious respect and the assurance of my entire devotion in the name of our Saviour.\n\n(Signed) F.X. Bellavance, O.S.F.,\nProvincial.\nSt. Constant, Que.,\nSeptember 17th 1929\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit to your consideration the herein enclosed copy of a letter dated 4th instant from Reverend F. X. Bellavance, Provincial Director of the Jesuits, to the Reverend Sister of the Indian Day Schools, requesting from her a rather radical change in the administration of the R.C. Schools at Caughnawaga.\n\nRev. Sister Superior appears to be somewhat disturbed and quite discouraged in view of this proposed change. I have asked her not to do any of these changes until further advised by the Department, and, permit me to suggest that one of the Department Officers be delegated at Montreal to interview the Catholic Authorities on this subject, with the least possible delay.\n\nI beg to add that I am of the opinion that Rev. Sister Superior might received instruction from the Department that she should, at least, not to abide to the first clause of this letter, the question of a change; mixed classes at Senior School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Superintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, September 20, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with enclosure, concerning the request of the Provincial of the Jesuit Order in connection with the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day Schools. Please instruct the Rev. Sister Superior to state, in her reply to the letter in question, that whereas these schools are conducted by the Department of Indian Affairs, suggestions or requests should be directed to the Department at Ottawa. In the meantime, there should be no change in the arrangement of the classes or in the instruction offered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nP. Q.\nMEMO FOR FILE\n\nReverend Sister Margaret Mary, Prefect of Studies, from the Mother House of the Sisters of St. Ann, at Lachine, and Sister Mary Francis, Principal of the Caughnawaga Indian Day School, visited the Department yesterday and today in connection with the proposed changes in the conduct of the Caughnawaga schools. It appears that, while Sister Mary Francis was ill and when the Mother General of the Order was in western Canada, the letter from Father Bellevance reached the Mother House. The community, having been ordered to discontinue co-education from Grades 3 up, effected the changes on the 6th and 13th instant. They endeavoured to get in touch with Mr. Letourneau by telephone at that time but failed to do so. The Sisters realize that they made a mistake in not bringing the matter to the attention of the Department immediately. They were instructed to make no further changes and not re-arrange the seating in the schools without authority.\n\nIt was explained that Father Bellevance had stated that, if the Department did not approve of the changes that were being made, a letter should be addressed to Bishop Deschamps.\n\nNo change in the course of studies has been made and the Sisters claimed that Father Bellevance's letter was really a poor expression of the Church's wishes. They claim the Church is satisfied with the one hour of French per day for the senior grades and an occasional explanation in French to those pupils in the junior grades who are better equipped in that language than they are in English.\nOctober 2, 1929.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI am informed that you have directed the Reverend Sisters of St. Ann, who conduct the Roman Catholic Indian Schools at Caughnawaga, to make certain changes in connection with the organization of the classes. I beg to point out that it was not competent for you to take this action. Unfortunately, through inadvertence, the Sister Superior of the Schools re-organized the classes, without submitting your directions to the Department, as she should have done. I am not directing her to return to the old system at the present time, as the question is still under consideration.\n\nThe Caughnawaga Indian Day Schools are financed and controlled by this Department, and any proposals concerning their conduct should be directed here. Such proposals will at all times receive the most careful and sympathetic consideration; but no changes can be allowed without proper official approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. F. X. Bellavance, S. J.,\nProvincial Superior of the Jesuit Order,\nSt. Mary's College,\nMontreal, P. Q.\nHon. Duncan C.

On m'avait rapport\u00e9 confidentiellement certaines choses regrettables qui avaient eu lieu, non pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, o\u00f9 les Soeurs exercent une surveillance efficace, mais au dehors, \u00e0 cause des rencontres facilit\u00e9es par le fait que gar\u00e7ons et filles fr\u00e9quentaient la m\u00eame \u00e9cole.\n\nVous me faites entendre que nous aurions d\u00fb auparavant en demander l'autorisation au D\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes. Outre qu'il s'agissait d'une question qui toucha \u00e0 la morale des enfants que le missionnaire a le droit de prot\u00e9ger, je dois avouer que je ne croyais pas que le D\u00e9partement s'occup\u00e2t lui-m\u00eame de ces d\u00e9tails. Et voici pourquoi je pensais ainsi :\n\n1- On m'a affirm\u00e9 que cette s\u00e9paration des filles et des gar\u00e7ons existait d\u00e9j\u00e0 il y a quelques ann\u00e9es, et que c'est le missionnaire d'alors et les institutrices qui, \u00e0 cause de circonstances sp\u00e9ciales, peut-\u00eatre le manque de local, les ont r\u00e9unis, sans que le D\u00e9partement s'en soit pr\u00e9occup\u00e9.\n\n2- Les noms donn\u00e9s aux \u00e9coles et qui subsistent encore indiquent clairement le fait de cette s\u00e9paration, il y a quelques ann\u00e9es. On dit commun\u00e9ment en parlant d'une \u00e9cole \"The Boys' School\" et, en parlant d'une autre, \"The Girls' School\".\n\n3- On m'a inform\u00e9 encore que la s\u00e9paration des filles et des gar\u00e7ons ne changeant rien au nombre des classes et des institutrices, le D\u00e9partement n'aurait aucun d\u00e9bours\u00e9 suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 faire.\n\n4- Je savais enfin que dans des \u00e9coles d'Ontario et de l'Ouest canadien, relevant de ce D\u00e9partement, on garde cette s\u00e9paration. Y avait-il lieu de croire que la m\u00eame chose ne pouvait pas \u00eatre permise \u00e0 Caughnawaga?\n\n5- J'ai donc conclu qu'il s'agissait tout simplement d'un classement des \u00e9l\u00e8ves lequel, si je ne me trompe, a coutume d'\u00eatre laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 la Principale. Et j'ai insist\u00e9 (je n'ai pas donn\u00e9 d'ordre, comme on semble le croire) aupr\u00e8s des Soeurs pour que le classement se fasse de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 faire dispara\u00eetre certains dangers pour les enfants, c'est-\u00e0-dire, en s\u00e9parant les gar\u00e7ons et les filles.\nVous insinuez poliment que je me suis ing\u00e9r\u00e9 dans les affaires du D\u00e9partement en agissant de la sorte. Nous ne nous pla\u00e7ons \u00e9videmment pas au m\u00eame point de vue. Quoi qu'il en soit, si j'ai empi\u00e9t\u00e9 sur les pouvoirs et les droits du D\u00e9partement, je le regrette bien, mais je n'en prie pas moins ceux qui ont la direction de ce D\u00e9partement de permettre cette s\u00e9paration des filles et des gar\u00e7ons dans nos \u00e9coles catholiques de Caughnawaga. Ils contribueront ainsi au bien v\u00e9ritable de cette r\u00e9serve.\n\nDans l'espoir que vous voudrez bien vous rendre \u00e0 cette demande que je consid\u00e8re tr\u00e8s importante, je vous prie d'agr\u00e9er, cher Monsieur, mes respectueuses salutations.\n\nF.X. Bellavance\nProvincial.\nMontreal, Oct. 8th 1929\n\nTo: Mr. Scott,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn absence of a few days I have been prevented from replying sooner to your favour of the 2nd inst., concerning certain directions given to the Reverend Sisters at the time, who are teaching in the School of Baughamaga.\n\nIt is evidently about the separation of the boys from the girls in the classrooms.\n\nI admit having thoroughly consulted the Sisters in favour of a separation, in the interest of good morals among the children. I have received confidential reports of regrettable incidents which had taken place not at the school where the Sisters are exercising efficacious discipline, but outside on account of meetings rendered easier by the fact that the boys and girls were frequenting the same school.\n\nYou have given me to understand that we should have previously asked authorization from the Department of Indian Affairs. Besides the question pertaining to the morals of the children which the Missionary has the right to protect, I must confess that I did know that the Department was paying any attention to these details. Here are the reasons why I thought so:\n\nIt was affirmed to me that such separation would prevent the boys from already being too close and that if was...\nhad, on account of special circumstances, may be lack of space, put them together without consideration on the part of the Department concerning the matter.\n\n2\u2014The names given to the schools and which are still subsisting, clearly indicate the fact of that separation a few years ago. Speaking of one school it is commonly called \"the Boys' School\" and speaking of the other \"the Girls' School.\"\n\n3\u2014I was also informed that the separation of the girls from the boys would not change the number of classrooms nor of the teachers, and that the Department would have no supplementary expenditure to make.\n\n4\u2014I knew finally that in the schools of Ontario and the Canadian West, under the direction of this Department, this separation is observed. Was there any reason to believe that the same thing could not be permitted at Ongiawaga?\n\n5\u2014Therefore concluded that the question was simply one of classification of the pupils, which if I am not mistaken, is generally left with the Principal. And I insisted I did not give any order as you seem to believe, with the Sisters that the classification be done so as to make certain danger for the children disappear; that is to say, by separating the boys and girls.\n\nYou boldly insinuate that I meddled with the affairs of the Department by acting in this manner; I evidently do not place ourselves at the same point of view; however, if I have encroached on the prerogatives and authority of the Department, I regret it very much.\nI nevertheless beg those who have the direction of this department to permit the separation of the girls from the boys in our Catholic schools of Oaquahawaga. They would thus contribute to the real welfare of the reserve.\n\nIn the hope that you will agree to this request which I consider very important, I beg you to accept, Sir, my respectful regards.\n\n(Signed) F.X. Bellavance, J.G., Provincial.\nOctober 16, 1929.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to the separation of the boys and girls in the classrooms at the R.C. Indian Schools at Caughnawaga. I am surprised that you understood the Department was not giving attention to details of this character. In addition to the question of administration, there is, as you point out, the moral problem, in which we are all interested. I am not satisfied that there should not be coeducation in these day schools.\n\nIn the last part of your letter, you request the Department to allow this separation of boys and girls in the classrooms. I shall make careful inquiries and will take whatever steps I believe are in the best interests of all concerned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. F. X. Bellavance, S.J.,\nProvincial Superior of the Jesuit Order,\nSt. Mary's College,\nMontreal, P.Q.\nI was surprised at the change made at Nun's Schools regarding co-education. I thought the system was working out admirably but somebody thought otherwise. The present plan is more expensive as one 8th or 7th or 6th would do whereas now you must have one for each sex.\nOttawa, December 12, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the application of Mrs. David for the admission of her children to the Caughnawaga United Church Indian Day School. Before considering this request, the Department wishes to learn more concerning the number of school children of tenants of holdings on the Indian reserve. Will you please prepare, with the assistance of the teachers and the truant officer, a list of children who are non-members of the band, who are attending the Department's schools. Your survey should include the St. Isidore, Bush, United Church and R. C. Schools. The names of the fathers and mothers should be given in each case and you should indicate the number of the reserve holding on which each family is located. Please also indicate whether the tenant resides there under the authority of official lease or if the tenant is unauthorized by the Department but is residing on the reserve by private arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nP. Q.\nSt. Constant,\nNovember 23rd, 1929\n\nSir,\n\nI beg you to refer to your letter of the 20th September last, in connection with the Caughnawaga R.C. Indian Day Schools and to ask you that in view of the representations which, as I am informed, have already been made to the Department, whether it is intended that the change which has been made suggested by the Rev. Provincial of the Jesuit Order is to be carried out, or, if these classes are to remain the same as they were previously organized and in spite of the instruction offered by the Provincial of the Jesuit Order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, December 20, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to the reorganization of the classes at the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day Schools. Before making a decision in this connection, it will be necessary for Mr. Ferrier to visit Caughnawaga, to make enquiries. In the meantime, no changes should be made, and you might let me have your own recommendation. Please state the cost of changing the seating and ask the Sister Superior if it would be necessary to engage an additional teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Indian Day Schools.\n\nAlthough there is a falling off in the average attendance, owing to illness (mumps) and also in the removal of several families to winter quarters beyond the Reserve, it is gratifying to state that, as in the past, the same excellent system of education and discipline continues and the same devotedness and interest prevail. The Sisters are energetic, painstaking and very unselfish.\n\nThe examinations given before the Christmas holidays are most satisfactory as evidenced by the tabulated percentages for each class. Earnest, careful work is being done in all the classes; in a word, the whole school has improved both in deportment and studies.\n\nReferring to your letter of the 20th instant, I beg to state that the approximate cost of reseating and of other requisites of three classrooms is $10.00. I shall be grateful to Mr. Ferrier if he visit the schools as soon as convenient that the necessary changes be made during the holidays.\n\nThe Reverend Sister Superior assures me that it is not necessary to engage an additional teacher.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nWith kind wishes for the New Year, I am\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Schools of the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve. I trust that, upon inspection, they will prove as gratifying to you as they have to me personally.\n\nAs in the past the attendance is very good, the discipline mild but firm, the devotedness and skill of the teachers, both religious and lay, unabating; in consequence of which the progress of the children is all that can be reasonably expected.\n\nA particular feature of this quarter's work was the display of sewing and cooking in the reception hall of the Senior School, which I took pains to visit.\n\nKnitting, plain sewing, cutting, crocheting, and simple embroidery had been taught, as was evidenced by the mittens and stockings, children's and misses' undergarments, aprons and dresses, which were on exhibition.\n\nThe results of the cooking classes were represented by canned vegetables and fruits, by prepared meats and vegetables, cakes and candies, and a perfectly laid dinner table.\n\nPerhaps the best effect of this new venture of the Department in favor of the Indians is the pleasure and satisfaction the pupils take in the work, and the interest and pride of the visiting parents in their children's success.\n\nOn the whole, the year has been a peaceful period of steady progress.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Superintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nI beg to state that Miss Mary Stacey who has been teaching at St. Regis Indian School for the past three years informs me that her mother is ill. She would like to teach in Caughnawaga this year in order to be home every day. She has applied to replace Miss Anniee Phillips who has tendered her resignation and will be married in September.\n\nShould the Department approve of this change and accept Miss Stacey's request, you will kindly inform me to that effect.\n\nMiss Margaret Regis, teacher at St. Isidore Road School for seven years, and at Caughnawaga for eight years, has applied for an increase in her salary. Miss Regis is remarkable for her untiring devotedness and she is very successful in her work.\n\nI believe the Department has every reason to be satisfied with Miss Regis, and I hope she will be allowed an increase of $100.00 per year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, July 31, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, relative to the request of Miss Mary Stacey for a transfer from her position as teacher at St. Regis Island to one of the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day Schools.\n\nIn this connection I have to request that you will consult the Rev. Sister Superior of the Caughnawaga R. C. Schools and ascertain from her whether she would approve of the appointment of Miss Stacey to teach in Caughnawaga. When we have this information, further consideration will be given the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nL.

Authority for this transfer is given, Miss Stacey to receive the same salary as paid to her when she was at St. Regis, viz., $75 per teaching month.

As you will remember, the case of this girl was discussed with you by the Superintendent of Indian Education when he visited the reserve on the 13th instant and it is hoped that the arrangements made at that time will be carried out. If the disposition of this case does not result satisfactorily, you should again bring the matter to our attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, P. Q.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nLast week I received check, No. 4275, dated Oct. 7, for $110.00 to pay for one month's salary. This is the same amount as we received last year, altho Miss Stacey's salary is to be $75.00 per mo., whereas Miss A. Phillips' was only $50.00.\n\nOver a week ago, I wrote to the Secretary to inform him of the mistake, and I am holding back the check until I hear from him.\n\nPlease may I ask you, as a great favor, to inquire if my letter has reached the Secretary.\n\nMiss Annie Snow came to me yesterday after receiving her check for $65.00, stating that she was told two years ago, that if she obtained her Superior Diploma, she would be entitled to a salary of $650.00 per year, and then an increase every year. As this is the first that I hear of it, I simply submit it to you. Miss Snow is probably aware of Miss Stacey's salary.\n\nWith respectful regards, please accept heartfelt thanks for your kindness.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 28, 1930.\n\nMadam:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 17th instant which refers to the salary of Miss Annie Snow, I beg to say that the Department is not aware of any correspondence promising her an increased salary, and I might add that it is not our practice to grant teachers of Indian day schools an annual increase.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, it is regretted that no increase can be given to Miss Snow at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Brown, M.P., wrote to the Superintendent General that Mr. Jacobs had taken an active part in the late general election, and he asked that his services be dispensed with, which action was taken in July, 1897. As Mr. Jacobs was not appointed by Order in Council, a Departmental letter was sufficient to dispense with his services.\n\nThere would not appear to be any position at Caughnawaga at present to which he might be assigned.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Besides the traditional awarding of premiums, the school children who had been classified into six groups according to their age or ability, under the direction of their able instructor, Captain Antonio Champagne, gave a pretty display of Physical Culture Exercises. I was, indeed, much surprised to see such good work. The drills were performed with perfect harmony, great ease and grace. One could hardly believe himself in the presence of a little band of Iroquois. The parents who have never evinced much interest in school work came in larger numbers to witness the feats accomplished by their children and went away surprised, proud and happy. It can be readily seen that the Physical training that these children are receiving is greatly improving their deportment. I am sure no city school could have appeared or done better than these Indians and I was very sorry that some member of the Department was not present to see and appreciate the good work accomplished by the devoted Sisters. Each year shows a remarkable amelioration, but this year the improvement is even more noticeable.\n\nThe pupils seemed quite pleased with their premiums. They were particularly delighted with the prizes offered by Captain A. Champagne who donated $10.00 given out in the form of dollar bills or fifty cent pieces for those who showed most dexterity and perfection in the Physical Drills.\n\nThe eleven Graduates appeared well and each received the Degun Diploma for successful Typewriting. Four among them also were awarded special prizes by Mr. Cudduhy for the good work done during his recent visitation of the classrooms. The pupils spoke their parts clearly and distinctly, some in English and some in French.\n\nI am sure we have every reason to be proud and satisfied with the work done in the Caughnawaga schools during the past year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Superintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are perfectly satisfied with the work accomplished during September. The children remember their success of last June, and it is most gratifying to observe the great interest they show in the program for 1931-32.\n\nLet us hope that nothing will prevent you from attending the closing exercises next June.

Sister Mary Francis, Supervising Principal of the Roman Catholic Indian day schools, with the request that she again grant permission for the use of the hall on the evening mentioned, or, if that is not convenient, on the evening of the 21st.

If the hall is not available on the 15th of December, they will be satisfied with the 21st, but the 15th is preferable. Arrangements could be made with Constable Jocks to be on duty at the building the night of the concert.\n\nI would request that you telephone Rev. A. J.

Q.\nMy dear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI regret to inform you that since it has been made known that the children of the United Church Indian Day School should occupy the hall of our Senior School for their Christmas celebrations, the faithful Indians of the Reserve are upset over this decision, because these bad Catholics have always been antagonistic to them.\n\nTo avoid like trouble on similar circumstances, permit me to suggest that these people might hold their gatherings at Kirby's Dance Hall or in the Councilors' Assembly Hall, which are vast enough to accommodate all these school children.\n\nTrusting you will weigh the decision taken by the Department, I am, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister M. Francis\nPrincipal\nResolution No. 598\n\nIt is proposed by councillor J. Belford, seconded by councillor J. Lacombe, that the Dept. of Indian Affairs be informed that discrimination is being practiced by the teachers of the Catholic schools of the village relative to the attendance of children of Indian parentage and those of white.\n\nIt seems that preference is given to white children in the attendance of an overcrowded class, Indian children sent home and white children retained.\nSt Constant, Jan. 4th, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit with the present letter copies of Motions Nos. 596 to 603 inclusive, which were passed by the Council of the reserve of Caughnawaga at its meeting of the 23rd day of December 1932.\n\nMotion No. 598\n\nI took note of this motion to enquire in the matter and report if it is necessary before the 15th inst.\n\nLorenzo Letourneau,\nAgent.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI have just handed in the quarterly report of the schools to Mr. Agent Letourneau, and they will reach you in due time.\n\nYou will notice that in spite of the bad weather conditions and illness brought on by the cold wave two weeks ago, the schools have been well filled this quarter. After ten days' rest, I hope the teachers and the children will enjoy better health.\n\nOur Reverend Mother Provincial who includes Caughnawaga in her annual visitation of the schools taught in the Province by the Sisters of St. Ann, was with us in November. She was pleased with the discipline and neatness in all the class rooms and found the girls as apt at sewing and knitting as any white child of the same age.\n\nDecember brought to us our Supervisor of Studies. She spent over a week examining the different classes and left a most favorable report. As she has been visiting the Caughnawaga schools since the last years, she is in a position to judge what great strides these children have made in the study of the\nEnglish language, especially in the higher grades.\n\nHence in spite of occasional difficulties we have every reason to be satisfied with the work accomplished with our pupils and trust the Government will appreciate our earnest endeavors to improve morally, intellectually and physically these poor \"children of the woods.\"\n\nPlease may I have leave of absence from April 11 to April 21, to attend the annual retreat at Iachine?

I find that Mr. Phelan, of the Schools Branch, is to be in Montreal during the next few days, on other work, and I thought perhaps it might save you a trip if he visited Caughnawaga, for the purpose of inspecting the schools and having a conversation with you. You will please expect him, then, sometime Monday morning, next, the 16th. After his visit, it is probable that it will not be necessary for you to proceed to Ottawa, as Mr. Phelan is thoroughly conversant with the educational policy of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

C. School. She further recommends that Miss A. Snow be transferred to the St. Isidore Road School from the Caughnawaga R. C. School. Miss Regis receives salary at the rate of $75 a teaching month at the St. Isidore Road School, while Miss Snow's salary is $65 a teaching month. I would recommend that the transfer requested by the Sister Superior be made and that salary be allowed each of these teachers for the academic year 1932-33 at the rate of $70 a teaching month, less 10%.\nOttawa, May 17th, 1932.\n\nMadam,\n\nWith reference to your recent report to Mr. Phelan regarding the teaching services at the St. Isidore Road Indian Day School, I beg to say that the Department approves of the transfer of Miss Margaret Regis from the St. Isidore Road School to the Caughnawaga R.C. School; this transfer to be effective from September 1st, 1932. It has been decided that the Department can allow Miss Regis salary at the rate of $70 a teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year, at the Caughnawaga R.C. School.\n\nThe Department also approves of Miss A. Snow being transferred from the Caughnawaga R.C. School to the St. Isidore Road School, such transfer to be effective from September 1st, 1932. Salary will be allowed her at the rate of $70 a teaching month, less 10% for the current fiscal year. The usual amount for janitor's services will, also, be paid her. Please advise me if Miss Snow is prepared to accept this transfer and you should, also, state if you wish the Department to notify Miss Regis regarding her transfer to the village school or if you will do this yourself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary\n\nRev. Sister M. Francis,\nSupervising Principal,\nR.C. Indian Day Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI feel it my duty to inform you that since the Concert given by the pupils of the United Church Schools on May 13th in the Senior School Auditorium, the balustrade of the staircase between the 2nd and 3rd floors needs attention. The railing itself is in a very shaky condition, four of the balusters are knocked out and several others loosened. Another mad rush, such as was witnessed at the close of that last recital, might produce a very serious catastrophe for, were the banister to give way, lives might be lost or children maimed.\n\nWe ourselves use the hall very frequently either for Physical Culture, Singing Exercises, or Sewing Lessons and, knowing the school is not too strongly built, we take the means to keep it in good condition. On this account, as well as for obtaining better discipline, thereby rendering supervision easier, we compel our boys to file from one part of the building to another with arms folded. Our girls also are not allowed to cling to the balustrade, hence we feel we are not responsible in any way for the present condition of the staircase, nor for whatever accident might occur in the future. Nor do we blame Mr. Robert who found himself more than sufficiently occupied in guarding the entrance door and warding off intruders from other parts of the building.\n\nThe Auditorium was not left in a very clean condition. The floor was\nnot only strewn with crushed paper bags, but even gum adhered to the floor. In the sweepings were found matches and cigarette stubs. The stage table was left minus a leg. During the latter part of the Recital, those sitting in the rear seats took the liberty of standing upon the chairs.\n\nI understand that Constable Jocks and Mr. Joe Jacobs took charge of the Auditorium during the evening, and though I believe they tried to do their duty, and probably did much to preserve order by their presence, they certainly lack that sense of foresight and minuteness with regard to details, so necessary when one desires to keep a building and its equipment in good shape.\n\nWe trust we shall be spared further annoyance of this kind as we feel that justice is not being rendered to us when we do our utmost to preserve intact all that the Government has placed at our disposal.\n\nHoping the above remarks will be taken into consideration,\n\nI remain,\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Russell T.

Montour\nJune 13th, 1932.\n\nDear Sister Superior,\n\nI have to acknowledge with thanks the invitation of the Sisters of Saint Ann to be present at the Commencement Exercises in the Senior School Auditorium on June 20th. I regret very much that owing to the fact that the Departmental work is very heavy just now, it will not be possible for me to be present.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nReverend Sister Superior,\nSisters of Saint Ann,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, June 27, 1932.\n\nMy dear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nAt the close of the Scholastic Year 1931-32 I come to thank you for the help rendered by the Department in so many ways thus enabling us to make our year in the classroom a successful one.\n\nAs you are aware, our Distribution of Premiums took place on June 20th. The Sisters were quite disappointed that office duties kept you away. We had hoped to the last minute that a message would reach us announcing your arrival in Montreal. As that pleasure was denied us, we trust that next June, when we expect to turn out a very nice and large Graduating Class, nothing will prevent you from honoring us with your presence. We had a larger number of guests than in the past. Formerly, school gatherings did not appeal to the people here, but gradually parents are becoming more interested in their children's success and such encouragement on their part makes our work easier. Four teachers from England attended our Closing Exercises, teachers whom the Montreal Catholic School Board had received last September for a year's experience across the ocean in exchange for four members of their own staff.\n\nIt was quite a revelation to them to learn that little Indians could be brought to do as well as white children. They were generous with their praises regarding the children's bearing, their perfect discipline throughout the entertainment, their good singing, and the precision and\ngrace with which they went through the Physical Culture performance.\n\nSuch applause from outsiders means much to us for we desire our Indian children to be looked upon with a friendly eye. In fact, we have every reason to be satisfied with our little band. Their deportment in the classroom, in general, has been very good, and when we take into consideration the latitude allowed these children in the homes, the \"Very Good\" gives way to \"Excellent\". The attendance also was far better this winter and the teachers noted with pleasure a vast improvement in the classwork. If we are to judge from the smiling face as each child received the rewards so generously donated by the Department, the pupils left us happy and contented. May September bring them back to us as light-hearted and as willing to continue their march in the path of knowledge.\n\nWith regard to the Bush School and that of St. Isidore Road, good work is being done even if not as apparent as elsewhere for one must bear in mind that these children are deprived of many of the advantages of which the village schools boast.\n\nBefore closing, I wish to add a word with reference to your inquiry about \"Maxim's Arithmetic Cards\" published by J.L. Hammett & Co. of Boston. We still use these cards in our Junior Classes and find them indispensable if one's aim is to develop accuracy; hence we strongly recommend their use to those who would render their pupils apt and quick at numbers.\n\nWith kind regards from the Teachers, I am,\n\nCordially yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier, Supt.\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 29th, 1932.\n\nMadam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th instant, I beg to say that the Department approves of the transfer of Miss Mary Stacey from the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day School to the St. Isidore Road Indian Day School, to take effect from September 1st, 1932. She will be allowed salary at the same rate as formerly, viz., $75 a teaching month less 10% for the current fiscal year.\n\nThe Department, also, approves of the transfer of Miss Margaret Regis from the St. Isidore Road School to the Caughnawaga R. C. Day School to replace Miss Stacey, this transfer to be effective from September 1st, 1932. She will be allowed the same salary as she was paid at the St. Isidore Road School, viz., $75 a teaching month less 10% for the current fiscal year.\n\nPlease advise me when you have completed the arrangements for the transfer of these two teachers, in order that Mr. Agent Letourneau can be notified.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Francis,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Day Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nOttawa, June 29, 1932.\n\nDear Sister Mary Francis:\n\nI am pleased to note, from your letter of the 27th instant, that the closing exercises at the Caughnawaga R. C. Day School were so successful. I trust that yourself and the other Sisters will have a most enjoyable holiday.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Francis,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that on Monday afternoon, June 20th, I had the happiness of attending Commencement Exercises at Senior School, on the Caughnawaga Reserve, during which the pupils gave a Physical Culture demonstration. The Program was quite attractive and showed that the little Indians can be trained to do something worthwhile. The lessons given by Captain Antonio Champagne are proving to be powerful factor in developing a sense of dignity in these naturally easy-going children and I trust the Department will not allow this item to be dropped from the school curriculum.\n\nThe children also sang splendidly several rather difficult choruses and thus revealed that they are in the hands of an able singing teacher.\n\nIn the Address given by one of the Graduates, special mention was made of the kindness of the Department towards the school children this past year. The rewards which consisted mainly of volumes were well chosen and the children seemed quite happy with their prizes.\n\nI believe that we have every reason to be satisfied with the work accomplished by the Sisters of St. Ann in the Schools of the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Sept. 17, 1932.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nIn answer to your inquiry of September 15, I beg to say that Louis Beauvais's statement concerning his daughter is utterly false. The child never made her appearance in school, nay, not even in the school yard.\n\nAfter investigation, I learned that Catherine had been to church early that morning, and one of the teachers having met her, told her to wear her hat to enter the Church. The child went home for it, but very likely, when Louis Beauvais heard that his daughter had gone to Church, he must have given her a beating or threatened her as he always did whenever he found out that his children went to Church. However, the child now attends the United Church School.\n\nI regret to say that Louis Beauvais has a very poor record on the Reserve.\n\nWith sincere best thanks, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDept. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Nov. 14, 1932.\n\nMy dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nOn Friday and Saturday next, November 18th and 19th will be held in Montreal at the d'Arcy McGee High School, the Teachers' Annual Convention. All Catholic Schools in the city will be closed on Friday so as to allow the teachers to attend the meeting.\n\nAs our Sisters in Caughnawaga have so few opportunities to hear Educational Questions discussed by experienced people outside of our own Community Circle, I take the liberty to ask you, dear Mr. Phelan, if you will allow our Sisters to attend this Convention. Several of those on our teaching staff are still young and I think an outing of this kind would prove an immense help in their classwork. It will not only give them a glimpse into the school world beyond their classroom walls but broaden their views and perhaps bring them in touch with newer and better methods.\n\nShould you find it in your power to favor us with a reply in the affirmative, I shall conclude, therefore that we may tell our children to remain home, on Friday, the 18th.\n\nThanking you for all past kindness, I remain\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nSr. M. [Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 15, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nRev. Sister Mary Francis, Principal of the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day School, has written the Department, requesting authority to allow the teachers to attend the Teachers' Convention in Montreal on the 16th and 19th instant. This will necessitate the R. C. schools on the reserve being closed on Friday, next. She is being informed that the Department approves of the teachers attending the Convention and that the schools may remain closed that day.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant,\nP. Q.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that I am in receipt of a note from Miss Viola Daly, Teacher of the United Church Indian Day School at Caughnawaga, which reads as follows: \"We would like to obtain permission to use the High School Hall for Friday evening Dec. 23 for our Christmas concert. We want the use of the curtains for the stage. Please reserve same as soon as possible and oblige\". (Signed) - Viola Daly.\n\nI presume that the hall in question is the Auditorium of the Senior School which is generally used by the Direction of the R.C. Schools at Caughnawaga. In such case I beg to leave the granting of this request to your entire consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, November 30, 1932.\n\nDear Sister Mary Francis:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Miss Daly, the teacher of the United Church Indian Day School at Caughnawaga. This reads in part as follows: \"We would like to obtain permission to use the High School for Friday evening, December 23rd, for our Christmas concert. We want the use of the curtains for the stage. Please reserve same as soon as possible and oblige\".\n\nAs you are aware, it has been the practice in past years to allow the use of the auditorium in the Senior School for this annual concert, and, as the precedent has been formed, it is rather difficult to refuse. We have, of course, kept in mind the facts given in your letter of May 23rd, last, and, in the event of permission being granted, very strict orders will be given to have every possible care taken of the building. Further, it will be pointed out that, if there is any complaint regarding boisterous conduct, permission for use of the building in future will be refused. Our reply to the request will be delayed until your answer is received.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Sister Mary Francis,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Dec. 4, 1932.\n\nDear Mister Phelan:\n\nYours of the 30th ult. has been carefully noted, and to speak plainly and truthfully, we are deeply disappointed to find that after the complaints made in May last, there is again question of allowing outsiders, totally indifferent to damage done to the building, to use our School Auditorium for the Xmas Entertainment. This innovation was introduced for the first time last year, in December and May, and not for years past as your letter seems to imply. In December, much of the woodwork was scratched on account of the enormous tree brought up the staircase. Of the damage done in May, you are already aware.\n\nWill you kindly allow me to make a suggestion, dear Mr. Phelan? Why not advise Miss Daly to use the Councillors' Hall which has not only a seating capacity of about two hundred, but also a stage with anterooms adjoining. Would not that be large enough for the Xmas tree needs of the forty pupils? Perhaps the Night School Equipment was formerly an incumbrance to Social Gatherings in this hall, but hindrances of the kind no longer exist. The room may not be as pretty as the Senior School Hall, but there, greater freedom may be enjoyed without fear of ruining any property and at the same time, it will allow one and all to have the \"right-at-home\" spirit which should pervade every Christmas Festival.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan, I have frankly laid forth my views on the matter, and now will leave you to do what you judge best.\n\nTrusting you will do your utmost to favor my standpoint of the subject, I enclose kindest regards.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 6th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, in which you state that you have had a request from the teacher of the United Church Indian Day School at Caughnawaga for permission to use the auditorium in the Senior R.C. Indian Day School for a concert on the evening of December 23rd.\n\nThe first request for the use of this auditorium was received last December and permission was, also, granted for its use on May 13th, last. Subsequent to both of these entertainments, the Department received reports regarding the damage done to the woodwork and, in addition, the bannister on the stairway was considerably damaged.\n\nThe hall used by the Councillors has a seating capacity of about 200; also a stage with an anteroom adjoining. Would it not be possible for Miss Daly to hold her Christmas entertainment in this hall? The Department considers that the use of this room would give those attending the Christmas entertainment greater freedom and, at the same time, avoid all danger of damage to the Senior School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Letourneau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nLaughnawaga, Quebec,\nDecember 4, 1932.\n\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe asked Mr. LeTourneau some time ago to write asking permission for us to use the Laughnawaga High School hall for our Christmas concert on Friday, Dec. 23rd. We have as yet had no reply to our request.\n\nCould you advise us directly as soon as possible regarding this matter, as we are very anxious to make final arrangements about our entertainment.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nViola M. Daly,\nTeacher, Protestant Indian Day School.\nOttawa, December 7, 1932.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, regarding your request for permission to use the auditorium in the Senior R. C. Indian Day School on the Caughnawaga reserve, to hold a concert on the evening of the 23rd instant.\n\nIn reply I have to say that Mr. Indian Agent Letourneau was written in this connection, in a letter of yesterday's date. The hall used by the Councillors has a seating capacity of about 200, also a stage with an anteroom adjoining. The Department considers that the use of this room would give those attending your Christmas entertainment greater freedom and, at the same time, avoid all danger of damage to the senior school. When the use of the auditorium in the senior school was previously granted, the Department received reports regarding damage done to the woodwork. You should interview Mr. Agent Letourneau, with reference to obtaining the hall used by the Councillors. He can assist you in making the necessary arrangements for its use.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Viola Daly,\nTeacher,\nProtestant Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant which I have just submitted to the Teachers of the United Church Indian Day School; needless to say that they have felt disappointed about it.\n\nAt their request, I beg to ask whether you may reconsider your decision, otherwise, as they say, they would have to cancel their Christmas concert. In support of their request the teachers claim to be unable to have a piano moved into the Council hall, also because their dispositions are already made for a concert into the Senior school Hall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nADIRONDACKJCT QUE 14 NFT\n\nMR PARKER\n\nDEPT INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nPLEASE WIRE REGARDING HIGH SCHOOL HALL FOR PROTESTANT CONCERT\n\nVIOLA DALY\n\nOttawa, December 15th, 1932.\n\nMiss Viola Daly,\nCaughnawaga Indian Reserve,\nvia Adirondack Junction, Que.\n\nREFERENCE YOUR WIRE TO MR.

Thomas Whitebean, our Missionary to the Indian communities of Caughnawaga and Oka, called at our United Church office in Montreal with the information that instructions had been received from the Department of Indian Affairs informing our church people at Caughnawaga that they would not this year be permitted to use the large assembly hall in connection with the Roman Catholic School.\n\nIt has been the custom ever since this hall was built for our people at Caughnawaga to use the hall for the presentation of a Christmas entertainment. This year they fully expected to use it and had all arrangements made for Friday, December 23rd. Mr. Whitebean informs me that Mr. Parker, Inspector of Reservations, last week visited Caughnawaga and after conference expressed his approval.\n\nThe alternative would be to use the old council hall over one hundred years of age. This, I am informed, is dingy and dirty, so much so that it is quite out of the question.\n\nInasmuch as the Montreal Presbytery has laid on me the responsibility of looking after the interests of our Indian Missions, I am writing to you to secure if possible a reconsideration of the issuing of permission for our people to use the hall as formerly. If this can be done I assure you it will be very greatly appreciated.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nConvenor of Committee on Home Missions of the Montreal Presbytery.\n\nKind personal regards\n\nAMC T.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, relative to the request made by the teachers of the Protestant School on the Caughnawaga Reserve for permission to use the auditorium in the Senior Roman Catholic school to hold a concert on the evening of the 23rd instant.\n\nThe use of this auditorium for an entertainment by the Protestant school children has only been granted on two occasions, viz., in December, 1931, and again in May of this year. A year ago, much of the woodwork was scratched in bringing in the large tree, which had to be taken up the staircase, also considerable damage was occasioned in May, last. The hall had to be thoroughly cleaned each time after it was used.\n\nUpon enquiry, it was considered that the hall used by the councillors, which has a seating capacity of about 200, also a stage with anteroom adjoining, would be satisfactory for the Christmas entertainment. The use of this room would give those attending the entertainment greater freedom, and, at the same time, would avoid all danger of damage to the senior school auditorium. In view of the above, the Department is not prepared to make any change in the decision already given.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. A.

About 5 years ago we used the Auditorium for the benefit of the Church.\n\nWe humbly beg your permission in virtue of a Departmental letter file No 5-1-9 and signed by our esteemed former guardian Dr. Duncan C.

All the members of the teaching staff are doing splendid work, whether it be in the moral, intellectual, or physical development of their Indian charges.\n\nI wish to praise especially the discipline which abounds in the classroom and the interest each Sister takes in the protection of the government property. The attractive and neat appearance of the classrooms suffices to indicate that every effort is made to render school life as pleasant as possible for the Indians.\n\nThe Teachers find that the daily lunch and Cod Liver Oil served during school hours robs the School Curriculum of very valuable time, but, on the other hand, they are glad to have food to give to many whose restlessness and languor in the classroom were due to want of nourishment.\n\nAs you are always aware, certain troublesome Indians would like to have their own in charge of some of the classes, but I believe the wisest plan for the Department to follow is to leave the entire school in the Sisters' care as long as they are able to control the larger boys as ably as they do at the present hour.\n\nTrusting you will be as satisfied with the work accomplished in the Roman Catholic Schools of Caughnawaga as I am myself, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, April 6, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, reporting on the work being performed by the Reverend Sisters in the Roman Catholic Schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nThe Department is pleased to note that splendid work is being performed and that each Sister takes great interest in the protection of Government property.

This boy is the son of Mitchell Deerhouse of this Reserve.\n\nAngus was attending school very irregularly until lately when he was compelled to be regular through the action of the truant officer. However I have to report that the boy, who is 14 years of age, is the worst pupil of this Reserve. His teacher is totally unable to get him to work nor to obey the orders given. This boy is setting a very bad example to the other pupils of his class and of the entire school, as he insults his teacher every day and openly challenges the Sister. The boy also swears at every moment during the class hours.\n\nThe parents of Angus do not seem to realize that they should correct him. Instead of that the boy's mother is taking part for him, which encourages his bad behaviour. This boy insulted very badly the Sister Superior lately by telling her words that I do not even want to write.\n\nI would strongly recommend that this boy be sent away to an institution where he would be taken care of by men, as if this is not done several of his class companions will imitate him, as some of them have already done, which will spoil the discipline of our Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Jan, 31, 1935\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nPlease may I be allowed to follow the annual retreat at Mount Saint Anne from February 1st to the tenth?

You instructed me to arrange to have constable Jocks take the boy to the school mansion.\n\nIn reply, I have to inform you, that the father of the boy is refusing to sign the application form\u2014which is enclosed herewith, and that he is also opposing to the sending of his boy to the above school. The father does not want his son to leave Caughnawaga.\n\nThis child is acting from worst to worst, feeling that his parents are with him, no matter what he does. It is considered that the boy is one, if not the worst pupil, who has ever attended the local schools. Following his examples, it has been noted, the older pupils in his school class are becoming very impertinent to the teachers and their parents. It is to be noted that Louis is under very bad home influences.\n\nI would recommend that, notwithstanding the opposition of his parents to his admission to Alfred, orders be sent, to compel his parents to let him go. By doing so the Department will render a service to the parents, the boy himself, the teachers and the other children attending the Eastern school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFr.

And further I have to warn you that if this NOTICE is not complied with within three days you are liable on summary conviction to pay a fine of not more than two dollars and costs or imprisonment for not more than ten days or both and your son Louis may be arrested without warrant and conveyed to the said school by the undersigned.\n\nTruant Officer.\n\nDated at this day of March, 1935.\nOttawa, March 2, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo, with reference to the son of Mitchell Deerhouse.\n\nRegarding this boy, I would point out that in your letter of January 31st you stated his name was \"Angus\" Deerhouse. You now submit an application for \"Louis\" Deerhouse. However, it is presumed that it is the same boy and that a mistake was made in stating the name in your letter of January 31st.\n\nIt is also noted from your letter of the 21st ultimo that the father is not prepared to sign the application form for the boy's admission to the St. Joseph's Industrial School at Alfred. In view of the information contained in your two letters, the Department considers that it is advisable to send him to the school mentioned. It has, therefore, been decided to take the necessary action under Section 10 of the Indian Act in order to place this boy in the St. Joseph's Industrial School at Alfred. For this purpose I enclose the following:\n\n(1) Notice to Mitchell Deerhouse, signed by the Deputy Superintendent General\n\n(2) Notice to Mitchell Deerhouse, which should be signed and dated by the truant officer.\n\nBoth these forms should be delivered at the same time to the father, Mitchell Deerhouse, by the truant officer. If, after three days, the boy has not reported to you, so that you could send him to Alfred, I would refer you to the authority given by Section 10 (4) of the Indian Act, which reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"and such child may be arrested without a warrant and conveyed to school by the truant officer.\"\n\nThe Department has prepared these forms in the name of \"Louis\" Deerhouse. If the boy's correct name is \"Angus\", you should change the christian name before handing the forms to the truant officer.\n\nThe cost of the transportation of the boy and the truant office to Alfred will be paid on receipt from you of a properly certified account, in triplicate. All expenses should be kept as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nENC.\n\nF. Brisebois Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nCaughnawaga, March 1st, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to my letter of the 21st instant, I have to advise you that the parents of Louis and Angus Deerhouse have, following a decision of the Department to place Louis at the St-Joseph Industrial School at Alfred Ont., become very ill disposed against the Sisters whom they blame for the Department's decision. Two days ago, during the class hours Mrs. Deerhouse called at the Eastern School, where her boys were and took them out of school in the middle of the afternoon, after having insulted the teacher of the boys.\n\nAfter having left the Eastern School, Mrs. Deerhouse went to the Protestant school and asked Miss Oulton, the teacher to take her sons, at her school. Miss Oulton is willing to take them but with the Department's consent.\n\nI do not recommend the admission of the Deerhouses at Miss Oulton's school, as the parents of the boys have no other reason for their transfer than their bad dispositions against the Sisters. If the transfers of the boys were accepted, it would mean that the Indians would take their children from one school, to another, whenever they would feel like it. I am also opposed to transfer of children during the middle of the school year.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nTo the Hon. G.T. Murphy, Minister of the Interior, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nThe Petition of the undersigned Chiefs of the Iroquois Band of Indians at Caughnawaga:\n\nHumbly sheweth:\n\nx x x\n\n4. The schools in the reservation are unsatisfactory. Boys and girls are taught by the Sisters. Though this may be all right in the case of the girls, it is worthless in the case of the boys. The teaching emphatically does not fit the latter for advancement in life. At sixteen they are turned out and told to seek education elsewhere. Their discipline is poor.\n\nMoreover, the religious lines drawn in the schools have operated to exclude the children of parents adhering to the ancient Indian religion. If the schools could be established on lines where boys and girls would be taught secular subjects together and religious subjects separately, we think the unity and morale of the tribe would be raised to a higher level.\n\nx x x\n\nF.

C. Indian Day School and endeavouring to have them placed in the Caughnawaga Protestant School.\n\nIn view of your report, the Department is not prepared to approve the transfer of these children and you should notify the Principal of the Caughnawaga Protestant School that they must not be accepted at that school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nP. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, February 27, 1935\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter (5-1-1), I wish to state that I did notify the Department of the changes in the staff early in the Fall.\n\nI think you will find this information either in Mr. Philip Phelan's or in Mr. A. F. MacKenzie's files. I am quite sure that this notification was sent in twice before the \"questionnaire\" was mailed. It surprised me to note on receipt of our monthly checks that the pay-roll list remained unchanged.\n\nWill you kindly excuse me, Mr. Sutherland, for not addressing the desired information to the right party? I promise to do better hereafter.\n\nThe qualifications of these teachers are as follows:\nSister M. Edwin:- Academic & Pedagogy Diplomas.\n\" \" Mechtilde:- Academic & Commercial\".\n\" \" Leocadie:- Classical High School Diploma.\n\nTrusting the above will prove satisfactory,\nI remain, dear Mr. Sutherland,\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education,\nOTTAWA.\nCaughnawaga, March 12th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, I beg to say that notice to Mr. Deerhouse, signed by the Deputy Superintendent General and notice to Mr. Deerhouse signed by the Agent, were delivered him personally last week. At the expiration of the three days, Mrs. Deerhouse, ran away with her two sons, Louis and Angus, during the absence of her husband. They have not yet returned, but will presumably be back soon, when the boy will be conveyed to the Alfred school.\n\nHowever, since the serving of the notices, new developments have taken place, and I beg to say that the two teachers of the Protestant School Misses Daly and Culton, together with Rev. Whitebean, have called twice at this office, to request me to allow the two boys to attend their schools. Mr. Whitebean and the two teachers claim that the Department cannot send the boys to Catholic institutions, this owing to the fact that Mrs. Deerhouse and her two boys have attended services at the United Church twice lately. Mr. Whitebean and the teachers are insisting that as Mrs. Deerhouse has taken her two sons to their church, they have become members of same. Mr. Whitebean claims not to have any objection to the sending of Louis to Alfred, but insist on having the younger, Angus's admission to the Protestant School approved by the Department. The facts are the followings:\n\nWhen Mrs. Deerhouse, who is supporting her older boy and refuses to cooperate with the teachers - was told that her son had to leave for Alfred, she blamed the Sisters for this, and in order to protest the Department's decision, she took her boys to Mr. Whitebean's church, in an attempt to elude your decision. In this she seemed to have the support of Misses Daly and Culton.\n\nI would not recommend any change in the Department's decision. In this case the principal involved is discipline and good order, and if the Deerhouses were allowed to transfer from one school to another, it would mean that, for the least thing or disagreement, between the Indian parents and the teachers of the respective schools of this reserve, one would see the pupils, travelling, from one school to another, thus spoiling the existing rules and agreement.\nMr. Deerhouse himself called at the office today and stated to be quite willing at present, to allow his son to go to Alfred, and is also willing for the other boy to go to the Catholic school, claiming that his wife is the only one responsible for his children not reporting and attending school and being away from the Reserve.\n\nI would kindly ask you to let me have your views in connection with the claim of Mr. Whitehead and the teachers with regard to their request, of sending the Deerhouses to their school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 15, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to the children of Mr. Deerhouse. It is noted that the mother has removed the boy from the reserve temporarily. As soon as he returns, he should be sent to the industrial school at Alfred.\n\nThe information contained in your letter has been carefully noted, and I enclose, for your information, a copy of official letter of today's date to Miss Daly, Principal of the Caughnawaga Protestant School.\n\nIt is hoped that, in future, these teachers will not interfere with matters that do not concern them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nOttawa, March 15, 1935.\n\nMadam:\n\nAs you are aware, one of the sons of Mr. Deerhouse has not been amenable to discipline while attending the Caughnawaga R. C. School. The Department fully considered his case, and it was decided to place him in the industrial school at Alfred.\n\nI have been informed that Miss Oulton and yourself have made a request to have him admitted to the Caughnawaga Protestant Day School. The Department regrets very much that you took this action, as you should not interfere in matters of this kind.\n\nAs far as the Department is concerned, Miss Oulton and yourself will perform all the duties required if you properly conduct the Caughnawaga Protestant School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Viola Daly,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga Protestant School,\nCAUGHNAWAGA, P.Q.\nCaughnawaga, March 18th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th referring to Mr. Deerhouse's children and enclosing copy of a communication addressed to Miss Viola Daly.\n\nIn reply, I have to say that Mrs. Deerhouse came back on the Reserve, Thursday last, the 14th, with her two boys, at which date, Louis was taken to Alfred, Ont. by constable J.K. Jocks. The younger boy, Angus, has today started to attend the Caughnawaga, R.C. Eastern School, where he used to attend. This case should now be considered as closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nA delegation of Indians from Caughnawaga called at the Department this morning consisting of the following:\n\nAngus Albany representing Section 4\nSteve Cross \" \" 4\nPeter B.

Johns \" \" 2\n\nAmong the matters discussed were the following:\n\n(3) That a change be made in the school system in Caughnawaga providing for a gradual replacement of the Sisters by lay teachers in order to give employment to students leaving the schools. The Councillors also asked that the boys should be taught by men.\n\nHarold W. McGill.\nMay 22nd, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Sutherland,\n\nWhen I visited the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day School on the 4th instant, Reverend Sister Mary Cleophas, the Principal, suggested the employment of an additional teacher.\n\nAs you are aware, classes are conducted in the school at the present time to Grade VIII, which is the highest grade in the elementary schools in the Province of Quebec.\n\nIf an additional Sister was engaged, Grade IX could be taught. This would permit keeping the girls in school until sixteen years of age. Many of them now complete their school course at fifteen, when they are too young to obtain work and, for moral reasons, the Reverend Sister considers that it would be very advisable to start the Grade IX work. In addition to the academic training, this would give another year for the girls to take advantage of the domestic science and sewing classes which the Reverend Sisters conduct.\n\nA salary of $800 a year would be required and there is accommodation in the Senior School for the extra room.\n\nI consider that it would be in the best interests of the children to adopt the Reverend Sister Superior's suggestion and I would strongly recommend that she be authorized to secure the services of another Sister who is a qualified teacher and begin Grade IX work in the Caughnawaga Senior School on September 1st, 1935.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dr. Superior, she is a little too severe in punishing my daughter, Ida Morris, 13 years of age. The child was sent to the bench; she could not place her decimal point, she was instructed by the child asked her to explain to her instead she buried her hands on the knuckles with a stick and buried her two hands on her back and back. It started one week ago, the child was punished around on the street after school hours by Dr. Superior. I went to the convent to speak to Dr. Superior, she denied same, and told me to get out. From the day she punished the child she said now you will get that for telling your mother last week, she called her devil and all most nice names the child answered she was not that to hurt her more. The pupils came after school to tell me, they said they were all crying even the Sr. Teacher was shedding tears of the incident, and that Superior told the...\nCaughnawaga, December 24, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant enclosing a communication received at Ottawa from Mrs. Josephine Diabo of this Reserve with reference to her daughter Ida Morris attending the Senior School.\n\nIn reply, I beg to transmit you the following report of Rev. Sister Mary Cleophas, Principal, regarding Ida's behaviour and character. According to the Principal, the girl has since the beginning of the school year been very stubborn and impudent for her teacher at school. A few days ago, Ida squarely refused to follow the instructions of her teacher, who unable to have the girl obey, sent for the Principal. The Principal was also unable to get anything from the little girl who resisted the Sister and insulted her in front of the whole class, for almost half an hour, whereupon, the Truant Officer, J.K. Jocks was called and was also boldly answered by Ida who stated to have been told by her mother that she was not obliged to follow the instructions given at school nor had the Truant Officer anything to do with her. As all had been tried unsuccessfully, the Principal sent the girl home, in order to give an example to the other children and to maintain the authority at school.\n\nThe mother and the girl called at this office and I may say that Josephine seems to be the one responsible for her daughter's misbehaviour, as she kept on saying that the Sisters have \"no right to make the children do what they do not want to nor to punish them, in any way.\"\n\nThe claim that she was hit on the fingers by the Sister is denied. There has never been any talk of sending Ida to Rigaud, as she is not the type to be recommended for such an institution. The Principal is informing me that she is not ready to re-admit Ida at the present, as this would surely encourage other pupils in rejecting the authority of their teachers.\n\nIt is to be regretted that the parents of the children who have no authority on them, do not cooperate with the schools, and moreover, seem to encourage them to misbehave.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 27, 1935.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, making complaint against the Reverend Sister Superior of the Caughnawaga R.C. Indian Schools, regarding your daughter, Ida Morris, who is attending the Senior School.\n\nThe Department has made enquiry regarding your complaint. It is found that your daughter has been impertinent to her teacher and has refused to follow instructions and obey discipline. Your daughter insulted the Sister before the whole class. It appears that she is encouraged in her actions by yourself. It was found necessary, by the Sister Superior, to send Ida home, as an example to the other children and to maintain the discipline of the school.\n\nIt is expected that you will cease encouraging your daughter in refusing to obey the Sisters. The Department is giving your daughter every opportunity of obtaining a good education, and it is thought the least she should do is to obey the teachers. I may add that, if there is any further cause for complaint, the Department will have to seriously consider the placing of your daughter in an Indian residential school. We are requesting the Reverend Sister Superior to re-admit Ida when the school re-opens after the present holidays, but her remaining at school will depend entirely upon her conduct and the manner in which she obeys the instructions of her teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMrs. Josephine Diabo,\nCaughnawaga,\nQue.\nOttawa, December 27, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, regarding the complaint of Mrs. Josephine Diabo against the Sisters of the Senior School, concerning the treatment which she stated her daughter, Ida Morris, received.\n\nI enclose a communication addressed to Mrs. Diabo and will be pleased if you will see that same is handed to her. You should see the Sister Superior regarding Ida Morris and arrange that she agree to re-admit her after the present holidays. It is hoped that this girl will obey the instructions of the teacher and that there will be no cause for further complaint.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nEnc.\n\nF. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, February 4, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nWe are forwarding under separate cover, a copy of the Montreal Beacon, containing an article on Canadian Poets. You will see that the Indian Pupils of Caughnawaga are \"stepping out\".\n\nThey responded very well to our appeal on Literature and we certainly were very proud of them.\n\nJust now, we are making preparations to enter A Spelling Bee to be held in Montreal in competition with all the schools of that city, including both Catholic and Protestant.\n\nLast Monday, we forwarded to the Catholic School Commission of Quebec, forty two drawings as our share in the Provincial Drawing Contest.\n\nWe thought you would be interested in this news.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\nConference On Canadian Poetry\n\nThat Canadian poets are neglected by their own is a complaint frequently heard; and the blame is laid, in part, on the schools that do not foster the taste and develop the knowledge in the growing boy and girl.\n\nThat a real beginning had been made was strikingly evident at the Third Annual Conference in January of the Course for Teachers in Service at the Institute of Pedagogy of the University of Montreal.\n\nA bright group of boys and girls of the Seventh Grade from the Caughnawaga Government Schools demonstrated how clearly they comprehended and artistically appreciated that haunting descriptive lyric of Archibald Lampman, \"Morning on the Lievre.\" To these children of forest and stream abroad in a canoe. Nature speaks with a voice and suggests a loveliness which we urbanites often fail to catch and to see.\n\nThe young lads of the Seventh Grade had studied Marjorie Pickthall's ecstatic poem \"P\u00e8re Lalemant.\" Only children as well versed in the practice of their Faith as these could have under the careful tutelage of the brother of P\u00e8re Lalemant, S.J., one of our own Canadian martyrs, could have found so much of interest and things to say of Marjorie Pickthall's long life, \"I lift the Lord on high!\" \"The blood of the martyrs is, truly, the seed of Christians.\"\n\nMiss Pauline Jocks, dressed in the dainty costume of an Indian maiden, closed the highly original hour with a piano rendering of Pauline Johnson's \"The Song My Paddie Sings,\" averring as her reason for donning the dress that Pauline Johnson herself wore her recitals from ocean to ocean in America and in England, where she was acclaimed by royalty even, usually appeared in the attire of her race.\n\nThis Canadian program was made possible by the fact that the Department of Indian Affairs of the Canadian government has adopted for their Caughnawaga Schools the newly published Canadian Catholic CORONA Readers, which abound in Canadian narratives and Canadian events.\n\nThe hour was given under the direction of the Sisters of St. Anne of Lachine, who have been in charge of these Caughnawaga schools for the past twenty years.\nOttawa, February 10, 1936.\n\nDear Sister Cleophas:\n\nI was very much interested in reading the account appearing in the \"Montreal Beacon\". I note that your pupils made a very creditable showing, and I wish to extend my congratulations both to the pupils and members of the staff of the Caughnawaga R. C. School.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Sister Mary Cleophas,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C.

Both Mrs. Phillips and Miss Stacey willingly agreed to take their Easter Week Vacation at this time. Therefore, when the village schools are on vacation, they will resume their duties. We hope that by that time the sick pupils will have recovered and the roads will be much improved.\n\nMiss Annie Snow, teacher of the Primary Grade at Eastern School is out sick and will not return before April. I called on her sister, Violet, to substitute for her in the meantime. The latter is doing very well under Sister M. Rose's supervision.\n\nMr. A. E. Wescott, our Inspector from Montreal came in this morning to begin the Spring Examinations. He visited the two Primary Grades yesterday and was very much pleased with the work accomplished since September.\n\nMr. MacKenzie, we hope to be favored with your visit in the near future to discuss school projects for the coming year. No visitor from the Department have called since last Spring. This is quite unusual, is it not?\n\nAll the members of the staff extend greetings for a Joyful Easter tide.\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nMr. A. F.

It is further noted that Mrs. Phillips and Miss Stacey will keep these schools open during the week following Easter to make up for the time which is now being lost.\n\nAn officer of the Schools Branch will visit Caughnawaga before the end of June, in order to discuss with you the work during the next academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Cleophas,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Schools,\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDR. MCGILL.\n\nI visited the Caughnawaga Reserve on June 5th and 6th and inspected all the classrooms.\n\nWith special regard to the Caughnawaga R. C. Day School, we have been employing, for some years, Capt. Champagne as physical training instructor, at a salary of $400 a year. I saw an exhibition of the physical culture work under the direction of Capt. Champagne and it could not be considered very satisfactory. On enquiring from the Principal, I found that Capt. Champagne teaches physical culture at several schools in Montreal and, as a result, devotes only a comparatively short time to the work at the Caughnawaga School.\n\nThere are approximately 350 children enrolled at this school and, of these, about 30 are backward. This is not a large proportion, as statistics show that in white schools approximately 10% of the children are in the same category.\n\nThe Sister Superior considers that if they had an extra teaching sister on the staff they could provide special attention for these 30 backward children. Such a plan would assist the children and, at the same time, help the classes, as these backward children are distributed in the various rooms and have a tendency to retard the work. This extra teacher would also be prepared to handle the physical drill.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend that the Department dispense with Capt.

Raoul Leduc has been driving our car for the past two years without any salary whatever. We have fed and clothed his family to keep them from starvation.\n\nThe correspondent in question, of course, is acting for Louise McComber (the trouble-maker), her brother (the mayor) and Andr\u00e9 Delisle, one of the councillors. They are opposed to Raoul Leduc because they think he gets a large salary from the Department. His barber-shop is one small room which he rents from Annie Stalk, an Indian; the latter has not the sympathy of the agitators, hence the opposition.\n\nWe hope, as usual, you will do all in your power to protect our interests.\n\nGratefully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nOttawa.\nAugust 4, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Calder:\n\nI have been directed, by the Honourable the Superintendent General, to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to Raoul Leduc.\n\nThe Reverend Sisters in charge of the Caughnawaga R. C. Day School own an automobile, and they employ Raoul Leduc to drive their car. As a matter of fact, they do not pay him any actual salary, but, for some time past, they have assisted in the maintenance of his family by supplying them with food and clothing.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Leduc is not an employee of this Department but is simply engaged by the Reverend Sisters, and any expenditure they make on behalf of his family is from their personal funds. It is considered that the Reverend Sisters are at liberty to employ anyone whom they desire.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nR. L.

Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI was greatly surprised to receive a letter from Mr. Brisebois, your agent at Caughnawaga, informing me that my services would be no longer required, and that my appointment as Physical Training Instructor would not be continued from September onward.\n\nThis decision on your part affects me greatly, seeing that I am married and have a family of five children to support.\n\nMay I mention at this time that I have seen service during the last War, and that I have always given of my best for the six years I have been carrying on as P.T. Instructor at the Indian School of Caughnawaga.\n\nI am proud to state that I have always obtained good results and that I have been successful in maintaining quite a high standard. This year, notwithstanding my best efforts I have not reached the standard of former years. I attribute this to lower mental and physical capacities of some of the pupils. The training this year has been very hard and trying due to the above mentioned.\n\nMr. Westcott, School Inspector, informed me that he was very satisfied with the training accomplished under the circumstances, and I am sure he would only be too pleased to corroborate my statement.\n\nMay I ask you to reconsider and have my re-engagement approved for one more term.\n\nThe reason why I mention the one more term is that I am quite certain that I can once more reach the standard of former years and give you satisfaction in every respect.\n\nMay I count upon your sympathetic consideration and receive an early and favorable reply.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I beg to remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nAntonio Champagne\n\n(Antonio Champagne, Major.)\nCaughnawaga, August 10, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 26th of June last, with regard to the physical instructor for the pupils of Caughnawaga R.C.

The answer given him was that it had been taken for reason of economy, etc., but this did not appear to be satisfactory to him.\n\nWould you be kind enough to send him a direct communication about your decision, at his address, 1667 Bennett St., Montreal, Que.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 12, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the duties you performed as physical training instructor at the Caughnawaga R. C. Day School.\n\nAfter carefully considering the requirements of the Caughnawaga R. C. Schools, it was found that, in order to save expense, it was necessary to curtail certain branches of our work, and it was, therefore, decided to discontinue physical training by an outside instructor.

I am also enclosing a letter from Viola Jocks applying for the same position.\n\nRelative to the second paragraph of Miss Jocks' letter, in which I am supposed to have expressed my opinion regarding the forfeiting of the rights of teachers getting married, I must say that nothing of that kind was ever mentioned to Miss Jocks or anyone else.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 5, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, in which you state that Miss Annie Snow, one of the teachers at the Caughnawaga R.

Indian Day School, will be married on the 14th instant.\n\nIn view of present regulations, it will be necessary for her to give up duties from the date of her marriage.\n\nThe applications for the vacancy, from Miss Violet Snow and Miss Viola Jocks, have been noted. Please consult the Rev. Sister Superior and advise the Department which of these girls she prefers. I may add that the Department is inclined to favour Miss Jocks. We have dealt very fairly with the Snow girls, and Miss Jocks is a qualified teacher of some years' standing but has never been given an appointment. When speaking to the Sister Superior, you should let her know our feelings in connection with this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nF.

But with all due respect to your attitude in the matter, I must say that both these young ladies qualified at the same time for a teacher's certificate. But that Miss Viola Jocks has been living in New York since and that Miss Snow has been here continually substituting off and on for the past three years. While Miss Jocks has had no experience whatever.\n\nWe would expect better results from Miss Snow and besides may I add confidentially that Miss Jocks has certain unfavorable rumors attached to her reputation here on the reserve that would cause quite a bit of gossip if she were connected with schools.\n\nI am in hopes though that the second paragraph of your letter will be enforced in the case of the renomination of Mrs. Mary Philips next June.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. A.

Jacobs whose wife is paid to make the translation in Indian of the French and English religious hymns, seems to fear that she might lose some money if the singing is not only in Indian.

They contend that money which ought to be used for the benefit of the Indians and their children, is, in reality, used to maintain the Sisters in the Convent; thus they request us to ask for lay teachers.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you regarding the matter, or to discuss it with your department when I am in Ottawa early in December.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nM.

A press dispatch, dated October 28th, states that Mounted Policemen had to be called to this reserve because of the threat of angry Indians to hinder the construction of a home for the Indian Agent. According to a communication from the Caughnawaga reserve, the Indians wish their tribal rights restored under the Treaty. They contend that their elective representatives have no authority, but that, in reality, the agent decides what request shall be sent to your department.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you regarding the matter, or to discuss it with your department when I am in Ottawa early in December.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nM.

Que.,\nFebruary 15th, 1938.\n\nDr. McGill,\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nThe Indians of Caughnawaga reserve are planning to hold an important meeting on Sunday evening February 27th, 1938, at 8.15 P.M., in the reserve of Caughnawaga.\n\nThe band and their councillors make this appeal to you Dr. McGill, to allow us Indians to hold our pow wow in the central Senior School community hall, which we understand that whenever the band would ask for the usage of this hall for public Indian affairs, would be granted from the Indian Department, whenever an application for such grant would be made.\n\nWe the Indians of Caughnawaga reserve therefore feel that you will give us your kind consideration and send us an early favourable reply.\n\nThanking you sincerely in advance\n\nWe remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nCouncillors of Caughnawaga.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant enclosing a communication received at the Department from J.K.Delisle, Mayor of this Reserve, in which he request to have the use of the Senior School Hall, for a meeting to be held on the 27th next.\n\nIn reply I wish to let you know that this meeting is supposed to be a gathering of Indians delegates from several other Reserves who are reported to have been invited here by some members of this Band and more particularly by the Chief Councillor Jos.K.Delisle and his nephew Jos. Delisle, in order to organize themselves to restore the so-called tribal rights etc., and to make representations to Ottawa to that effect. In connection with that meeting I beg to refer you to my letter of the 3rd instant in which I enclosed a clipping from the Montreal Gazette.\n\nI must point out that there are two Halls on this Reserve which, no doubt, could be obtained by the organizers of this meeting. One is the Hall located in front of the Indian office and called the \"Community Hall\" and the other is the Council Hall. It is feared that if the use of the Senior School Hall is permitted on that occasion, this will open the way to other request for same and will constitute a precedent. Mr.Delisle' letter is returned herewith.\n\nYours truly\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Please advise the Council accordingly.\n\nIn connection with this matter I have to advise you that if the Indian delegates give any trouble under the trespass Sections of the Indian Act, you can prevent them from remaining on the reserve overnight, and furthermore, if you have reason to believe that they are there for any illegitimate purpose, you may order them to remove from the reserve.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\n\nFr. Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Quebec.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, February 22, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn reply to your letter 5-1-1 of the 16th instant, I beg to state that last winter, several complaints were made because we did not allow the children to come in before nine. After having discussed the matter with Mr. Phelan, Agent Brisebois and the Pastor, we decided to allow the children in at 8:30 for a study period as the home conditions are anything but favorable for concentration.\n\nIt is very hard to please these Indians at any time. When one group wants one thing, the other group is fighting for the contrary.\n\nYour final decision regarding the matter will be faithfully followed by\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal, I.

Brisebois, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGaughnawaga, Que.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Que., June 15, 1923.\n\nThe close of the present school year will mark the end of my term of office as local Superior and Superintendent of the Schools in Caughnawaga. Before leaving, I feel it my duty to thank you for your very great kindness and consideration as well as for the keen interest you have shown in my work. This made the task less strenuous than it might otherwise have been.\n\nWhen in September 1917 I came here, the conditions were anything but hopeful. But I kept before my mind the suggestion you made at the time in an official communication to Mother Mary Melanie, the Superior General, regarding the possibility that I take up my duties in a conciliatory spirit. Now that six years have elapsed, I can safely assert that I tried to prove true to my promise, and avoided all unpleasant relations with the people. I labored for the uplifting of the race, and the improvement of the Schools, giving the best of my years of experience to the work of teaching the Indian children.\n\nI feel that little would have been accomplished had I not met with the courtesy, generosity and support of the Officials of the different branches of the Department, and to each and every one of these I wish to express my sincere gratitude.\n\nWould you be good enough to extend to them all, to Mr. McKenzie, Mr. McLean, Mr. Chene, Mr. Ferrier, Mr. Sutherland, Mr. Williams, with whom I have had special relations, the assurance of my deep appreciation.\n\nI have been officially appointed Provincial Superior of our British Columbia Province, and will have under my jurisdiction the Indian Schools of Ramahps, St. Mary's and Kuper Island. I need hardly tell you that I shall keep a very kindly eye on these houses in view of the fact of my relations with the Department here.\n\nI will leave for British Columbia on July 8th, in all probability and will reside in our Provincial house in Victoria, Vancouver Island.\n\nThanking you once again, and assuring you that the interests of the Indian Schools in the West will be the object of my constant care,\n\nI am, dear Mr. Scott,\n\nYours very cordially,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. D.C.

Jacobs, M.D.\nPhysician and Surgeon\nCaughnawaga, P.Q.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI have received your letter of the 26th inst., in which you state that you approve of the R.C.I. school opening at 8:30 a.m., because it is in the best interest of the Indian school children.\n\nAs a medical man, I regret to say that I entirely disagree with that statement. As a matter of fact, I know that these long school hours are injurious to the good health of the Indian school children. I know that if the children are not at school at 8:30 a.m. each morning, that they are punished for being late.\n\nI still insist that for the best interest of the\nIndian school children, the schools should open only at 9.00 a.m. each morning, and not at 8.30 a.m.\n\nThere appears to be too much tendency to confuse education with mere \"book-learning\" and so has limited its applicability to the needs of our children.\n\nHoping that you will grant my request for the sake of the future good health of our Indian school children,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.H. Jacobs M.D.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, in which copy of a telegram received at the Department from P.J. Delisle of Caughnawaga in which he protested against the use of the Senior School hall on March 1st.\n\nIn reply I wish to let you know that the hall was used by the Sisters when a free concert was given on that evening at the occasion of Rev. Father Lalonde's birthday. Father Lalonde is the parish priest at Caughnawaga. It has always been the custom to celebrate the parish priests' birthday at the local Senior School. On such occasions a concert is given by the pupils under the direction of the Sisters, and the parents of all the children attending school are sent invitations. It is likely that the telegram was sent because Peter J. and the other organizers of last Sunday's gathering of Indians could not obtain use of this same hall.\n\nIt is regretted that a man like Peter J. Delisle found expedient to send such a communication to the Department. Mr. Delisle is a Senior Clerk at the Pointe-St-Charles Post Office Division, Montreal, Que.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, March 7, 1958.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI wish to inform The Department that our First Grade Teacher, Sister M. Adrienna had to be removed to our Lachine Infirmary on account of sickness. She is replaced in her duties at Kateri School by Sister M. Lucie. Will you kindly have this change made in the Pay Roll?\n\nA group of girls is getting ready to leave Tuesday next for Saint Jacques. They seem quite happy to have this opportunity. May they give satisfaction and be a credit to themselves and to their benefactors.\n\nWe expect to be ready for Manual Training for the boys soon. The work Bench is being put together and I expect a definite estimate of the necessary tools we are getting for the boys.\n\nWould you think Fifty Dollars a month too much to pay the Brother's services? I will expect word from you before closing the Entente.\n\nOur reception in honor of Our Reverend Pastor last Tuesday evening in Senior Hall was very peaceful in spite of threats, letters, telegrams and delegations to The Department. All our pupils were present and did their very best to please the audience. We had a full Hall of sympathetic friends. Another proof of the minority of the agitators.\n\nVery respectfully and gratefully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan, Chief,\nDepartment of Education,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nOttawa,\nMarch 9, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Caulnawage R.C.

Adrienna the Department has approved the appointment of Sister M. Lucie at a salary of $650.00 a year. She began duties on March 1, 1938. I enclose copy of letter of appointment.

File # 17989\n\nFrom the service record of Mr. Peter J. Delisle furnished by the Post Office Department, it is noted that he was employed in the Department of Indian Affairs as a teacher at the Caughnawaga Boys' School, Montreal, during the period from August 27th, 1900 to December 31st, 1914, at a salary of $400.00 to $500.00 per annum.\n\nWill you please advise us if Mr. Delisle was in receipt of a living allowance during this period.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Accountant.\n\nGEB/AET.\nOttawa,\nApril 8, 1938.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 6th instant with reference to Peter J.

Brisebois\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 23, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY:\n\nI attended the Commencement Exercises of the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day School, held on Wednesday June 22nd.\n\nI attach, for your information, a copy of the programme. In my remarks I extended the greetings of Dr. McGill and yourself and explained why you were unable to be present.\n\nThe efforts of the children are extremely praiseworthy, and I think that yesterday's commencement exercises compared very favourably with any I have previously seen.\n\nWith the closing of the academic year, 10 boys and 7 girls completed their course at the Caughnawaga R.C. School. Some of these will probably wish to take additional training, and the Sister Superior and the Agent will write later regarding those whom they recommend. I pointed out to them the advisability of encouraging any who wish to go ahead to take practical courses rather than academic work. Both the Agent and the Principal agreed with this suggestion.\n\nThe sewing, knitting, art work and some of the other work was exhibited in the various classrooms and made a splendid showing. The vocational training is so important that I feel a separate memorandum should be submitted to you in regard to this.\n\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nIn re-organizing classes for the September opening, I find that I might be able to get along with one Sister less at $500.00 on our pay-roll. This might solve the problem of the Manual Training instructor without additional cost. If this meets your approval, we might try out this arrangement for this year and see how it would work. Will await a reply on the matter.\n\nSister M. Anne-Julia transferred to St-Jerome is replaced here by Sister M. Catherine. No other changes on the staff to date. I am so happy to keep all my same teachers.\n\nMiss Moodie must have told you that we will expect no compensation for the supervision of her summer weaving class. The girls are most anxious to see the outcome of it all. The Ottawa exhibition is spurring them on. I hope Miss Moodie will not be disappointed with the result of our efforts.\n\nIf a scholarship is given for St-Jacques and Bunice Laforce is not eligible I wish Violet Douglas might be considered. She is a good girl and a hard worker.\n\nWith kindest regards to all the family from all the Teachers of The Reserve particularly from\n\nYours very gratefully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan, Chief of EDUCATION,\nDepartment of MINES & RESOURCES,\nOTTAWA.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nRe - Caughnawaga R.

She will be replaced by Sister M. Catherine.\n\nThe name of Sister M. Anne Julia should be omitted from future pay-lists and replaced by the name of Sister M. Catherine, who will be paid salary at the rate of $750 a year.\n\nI enclose copy of letter of appointment, and Staff Questionnaire will be forwarded to you as soon as received.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, August 12th, 1938.\n\nReverend Madam:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, the Department approves of your suggestion to drop one sister from the teaching staff at the Caughnawaga R.C. School. The amount saved on her salary, viz., $500, could be given to the manual training instructor.\n\nFor record purposes, please let me know the name of the teaching sister whom you intend to drop and also the name of the manual training instructor. We will issue a cheque for his salary in the same manner as cheques are issued to the teachers.\n\nIt is noted that Sister M. Anne Julia has been transferred and she is being succeeded by Sister M.

Anne-Julia was being transferred from Caughnawaga and would be replaced by Sister M. Catherine. In checking our pay list this morning it was brought to my attention that we already have a Sister M. Catherine on the list for Caughnawaga. Does this mean that there will be, for the academic year 1939-40, two Reverend Sisters by the name of Sister M. Catherine.\n\nOur letter of the 12th instant was probably not as explicit as it should have been. If you intend to drop one of the Sisters you should let me know her name and at the same time you should let me know the name of the manual training instructor in order that his name may be substituted on the pay list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

An emergency hospital was the cause of this change in the Staff.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan, Chief\nDepartment of Education,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 31, 1939.\n\nDear Sister:\n\nYour letter of the 28th instant reached me this morning. You may have the leave requested to attend the annual retreat.\n\nIt is noted that Sister M. Alma will be in charge of the Caughnawaga R.C. school during your absence.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Sister M. Cleophas,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga, R.C. School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nDear Sister Cleophas:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo regarding the replacement of Sister Laurence by Sister Clarice I enclose staff questionnaire which I should appreciate your completing and returning as soon as possible.\n\nAs the cheques for February have already been issued Sister Clarice's appointment will officially date from March 1, 1939. I presume that it is your intention to have her remain on the staff at least until the end of the current academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Sister M. Cleophas,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga R.C.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Sister Cleophas,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga R.C. School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nOttawa,\nMarch 22, 1939.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Caughnawaga R.C. School No. 305.\n\nRev. Sister Clarice is replacing Rev. Sister Laurence on the staff of the above school.\n\nThe appointment of Sister Clarice will date from April 1, 1939. She will be allowed the same salary as the preceding teacher, namely, $75.00 a teaching month.\n\nStaff questionnaire has already been forwarded to you and I enclose copy of letter of appointment.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIt is proposed by Michael Montour seconded by John Laurence that the local Indian boys be taught by laymen teachers. We have three local Indian boys who are willing and efficient to teach, namely, Harry Williams, John Leclaire and Frank Montour. For qualifications of these three boys, refer to the Records in your Dept. Unanimously adopted by the following councillors:\n\nJ. Belisle Jr.\nJoe & Delcide\nJohn Taylor\nMoses Taylor\nClaire P. Godin\nMike T. Montour\nRobert Pic\nJohn Lacombe\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to transmit you herewith the resolutions passed at the July meeting of the local Council held under the presidency of Constable Jocks, who replaced me as president of the meeting owing to illness in my family.\n\nResolution No. 934.\n\nIn connection with this resolution I may say that it would be the wish of the council to have lay Indian teachers for the boys. They mention three names; but I regret to say however that not one of those mentioned would be qualified for the position as the three of them have completely failed in their studies.\n\nAt all events the present system of education at Caughnawaga compares favourably with any other of this province.\n\nFr. Brisebois.\nAgent.\nCaughnawaga, Oct. 2nd, 1939.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR SEPTEMBER 1939.\n\nRe: Schools\n\nSchools have reopened on the fixed date and the attendance is good. At the R.C. schools in addition to the regular program the girls are learning weaving and the boys have their manual training.\n\nFrs. Brisebois,\nAgent.\nOttawa, October 18, 1939.\n\nDear Sister Cleophas:\n\nI understand that a number of white children whose parents live on the Caughnawaga reserve are at this date, and have been for some time, enrolled at the R. C. schools on the reserve. It is unnecessary to point out to you that the Government is under no obligation whatever to provide instruction for these children.\n\nI have been informed that it is the intention of the Department to ask the parents of these children to leave the reserve at an early date and a notice to this effect will reach these white residents of the reserve in the course of a few days. A list of these residents will be submitted to you by Mr. Brisebois. I am of the opinion that all white children whose parents have been asked to leave the reserve should be excluded from your schools. It is highly desirable that your notice to these children to leave the school should reach the children and, through them, the parents at the same time that they receive the departmental notice to remove from the reserve. It is the wish of the Department that you should co-operate with the agent in his attempt to remove these pupils from the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend Sister Cleophas,\nSupervising Principal,\nR. C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, Quebec.\nLaughranawaga, Que.\nDec 5/1939\n\nResolution 958\n\nIt is proposed by Mike T. Montour seconded by Andrew Delisle whereas that after due and serious consideration by the members of the band for the proper education of the male children of school age numbering over 250 at the present time exclusive of the whites, it is felt very urgently expedient that the present system of teaching be substituted, that our boys be taught by Lay Teachers to receive greater and more suitable educational benefit from the money that is legally voted for such appropriation.\n\nUnanimously adopted by all the Councilors and the band.\n\n[Signatures]\n\nJack Delisle\nMoses Taylor\nAndrew Delisle\nJohn Taylor\nJohn Lawrence\nR.J.

It seems that the aim of this resolution would be to secure positions to a few male Indians who attended high schools for a few years, but never succeeded in finishing their courses.\n\nFrs. Brisebois.\nIndian Agent.\nCaughnawaga, Dec. 7th, 1939.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MONTH OF NOVEMBER\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nThe attendance at the reserve schools has been fairly good. It is reported however, by the teachers that the children have been bolder and inclined to be more impertinent towards them. This is believed to be caused by the anti-white campaign going on in Caughnawaga, and also to the statements of a few councillors who would wish to replace all white teachers by Indians.\n\nFr. Brisebois,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 18, 1939.\n\nDear Sister Cleophas:\n\nI desire to refer you to my letter of October 19 last, also the recent visit of Mr. Phelan to the Caughnawaga Reserve with reference to certain white children who are attending the Caughnawaga R.C. school.\n\nI understand that in the families ejected from the Reserve some weeks ago and who later returned and are still residing on the Caughnawaga Reserve there are the following children who have been in attendance at the Caughnawaga R.C. school:\n\n- Williams family - 2 children\n- Robert family - 1 child\n- Leduc family - 4 children\n- Oulmet family - 5 children\n- Dufour family - 2 children\n\nIt has been decided that the above-mentioned children should not be allowed to attend any Indian day school in the future. Consequently if they come to the Caughnawaga R.C. school when it re-opens after the Christmas holidays, namely, January 3, 1940, they should be informed that they cannot be allowed to attend.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Indian Agent Brisebois in order that he may be fully advised regarding our wishes. I am informing Mr. Brisebois that he should give you every possible support in the event of these families causing any trouble. The decision that is contained in this letter has been made by the Department and your only share in it is to carry out our instructions.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Sister M. Cleophas,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga R.C. School\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nDecember 18, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which is being forwarded today to Rev. Sister Cleophas, Principal of the Caughnawaga R.C. school.\n\nPlease note particularly the last paragraph in which we promised the Principal that she would receive every possible support from you. You should have the truant officer visit the school on January 3 and if there is any trouble whatever he should immediately take charge of the matter and relieve the Rev. Principal and the other Sisters of all responsibility.\n\nWhen Mr. Phelan visited the Reserve recently he understood that there were no children of the ejected families attending the Caughnawaga U.C. Indian day school. If there are any attending this school you should let me know at once in order that a letter similar to the one written to Sister Cleophas may be sent to the Principal of the Caughnawaga U.C. school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nDecember 21, 1939.\n\nDear Sister Marie Cleophas,\n\nI wish to take this opportunity to thank you for the good wishes conveyed by the dainty, hand-painted blotter, and to extend to you and your staff the compliments of the festive season.\n\nI have, on several occasions, recalled with pleasure and satisfaction the closing exercises which it was my privilege to attend on my most recent visit to Caughnawaga.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE.

Sister M. Cleophas which was dealing with the children of the evicted families attending the R.C. Indian Day Schools on this Reserve.\n\nIn reply I wish to advise that the matter was discussed with the Rev., Principal and that your wishes will be carried out. The truant officer will call at the schools at their re-opening in order to help the teachers, if needed.\n\nThere are no children of the evicted families attending the U.C.

I have had an opportunity from time to time to inspect the handwoven ties, scarfs and bags produced at your school by the senior girls. The fine workmanship displayed in the production of these articles reflects, in my judgment, great credit, not only on the pupils but on those responsible for their instruction.\n\nI have been informed that you have completed a period of fifty years of educational effort. It is difficult to overstate or overemphasize the unselfish contribution you have made in this period of time.

We remember particularly your enthusiastic and successful attempts to organize and promote worthwhile handicraft projects at your school in recent years and the worth of these to the senior girls who took advantage of them.\n\nWe regret more than we can easily express in words your departure from the Caughnawaga school, your devotion to duty, your unfailing courtesy at all times and your contribution to the cause of human betterment on the reserve. These, we shall always remember with gratitude. There are few people, even in the sphere of missionary effort, who have succeeded in establishing such a record of faithful and unselfish service.\n\nMay we, in thanking you for your contribution, express the hope that the years that may lie ahead of us may bring to you the best that life itself has to offer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

The Caughnawaga R.C. School has been in operation for three months of the current fiscal year; namely, April, May and June. Consequently you will see that salary is only available for six additional months. Therefore, it will not be possible to consider the suggestion of the new Superior of this school that the school should re-open on September 15.

Brisebois,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Aug. 22, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nSometime towards the end of the last school year, Sister Mary Cleophas, principal of the Caughnawaga Schools wrote you concerning the reopening of classes. While examining our files, we find no answer to this letter.\n\nWe fully understand the government's position in the present war crisis but we would willingly reopen our classes in September as previously scheduled without salary in an endeavor to take the children off the streets.\n\nHowever, may we suggest that we reopen our classes on September 16 and close them around June 15th, it being understood that we are to receive but the nine-months' salary? We would appreciate an early reply to this suggestion so that we may be guided accordingly.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6075, file 305-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 26, 1940.\n\nMy dear Sister Superior:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 22nd instant, in which you seek information with respect to the re-opening of the Caughnawaga R. C. Indian Day School.\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter dated August 20 and sent on by me to Indian Agent Brisebois. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory. The fiscal year of the Government begins April 1 and ends March 31. Consequently, it would be impossible for us to accept your suggestion, for the simple reason that we would not have at our disposal, in the estimates of this year, the sum necessary to pay the teachers in full for the period September 15, 1940, to June 15, 1941. There is no valid reason, however, why the Sisters should not open the school on September 15, provided they are prepared to teach without remuneration from September 15 to September 30. A number of Indian day school teachers, as a matter of fact, are doing this. However, this is a matter you could discuss with the Sisters themselves. The Government has no desire whatever to even suggest that the Sisters in charge of the school should do this.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to express the hope that you will find the work at Caughnawaga interesting and well worth while. It is my hope that I shall have an opportunity of meeting you at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nRev. Sister M. Jean de Dieu,\nPrincipal, R. C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, P. Q.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Aug. 29, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWe have your letter of the 26th instant regarding the reopening of schools. We thank you for your prompt reply. We are pleased to advise you that all the sisters are very willing to start on September 15th, it being understood that there will be no remuneration from the Government for the period of September 16th to October 1st.\n\nThere is another matter which we would like to bring to your attention for prompt settlement. We have tried but without success to get a younger brother than Brother Gauthier, to give the Manual Training lessons to our boys. However Brother Gauthier is very much eager to continue his work with our Indian charges. Would the Department consent to keep the above-named brother on its payroll? Brother Gauthier has always shown himself an expert carpenter, willing to lend his help wherever he was needed. The Weaving Studio especially owes him a debt of gratitude for cupboards, benches, shuttles, etc.\n\nWe are anxiously awaiting your answer. We also hope that we will have the opportunity of meeting you soon.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R. A.

This action on the part of the Sisters is very commendable and deeply appreciated by the officials here.\n\nI note that you have attempted, without success, to secure a successor to Brother Gauthier. In view of this fact, the re-engagement of Brother Gauthier is acceptable to the Department and approved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nRev. Sister M.

His superior told me definitely yesterday that Brother Gauthier could not take up the work next fall and that the Order had no one available for the work. This is another problem here. The Brother is ailing and has become incapacitated.\nDear Sister Jean de Dieu:\n\nI desire to refer to that portion of your letter of the 4th instant in which you state that Brother Gauthier's services will not be available for the academic year 1941-42.\n\nI will discuss this matter further with you when I visit the Reserve on the 22nd. It has occurred to me that possibly there is one of the Sisters who would be qualified to do this work. I know that lay teachers take the course at normal school but I am not certain at the present time whether the Sisters do so. In the event of one of the Sisters wishing to attempt it I could arrange to have Mr. A.J. Doucet spend a week with her early in the new academic year. Mr. Doucet has recently joined the staff of the Department and has had considerable experience in teaching vocational work. At the present time he is visiting the Indian residential schools in the Province of Alberta. You might think over this suggestion and we can discuss it further on the 22nd.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nSister Jean de Dieu,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga R.C.

We will most likely face the same difficulties this coming year, if more drastic measures are not taken to get our pupils at school. I mean both parents and children must pay the penalty or no change will result, I am very sure.\n\nCould not the Agent inflict a fine penalty on stubborn absentees' parents or on pupils leaving before their sixteenth year? There must be a drastic movement made at the school opening or our past difficulties will continue and even increase. We have suffered much in the past, but I trust that efficient discipline will afford us as regards regular school attendance. All, you understand, must be made to adhere to school regulations with no mercy whatever\u2014reasons for leaving at fifteen because of size, help needed by parents, etc., etc., should not be tolerated but I must be strictly upheld by the Agent and the Truant Officer whom parents and children will fear.\n\nI am confident, dear Mr. Phelan, that you will help us as school work would benefit by regular attendance.\n\n2.\u2014Has any decision been reached as to the Woodwork?

They are also willing to pay the cost of the books which will be furnished to them.\n\n\"This school is supposed to open on the 15th of September and I would be obliged if you would take this request in consideration and let me know as soon as possible\".\n\nWill you please furnish a draft letter in reply, for the Private Secretary's signature.\n\nDr. McGill -\n\nFor draft reply as requested.\n\nW.C. Bethune,\nAsst. Private Secretary.\nOttawa, September 9, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Raymond:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of September 4, written by you on behalf of a number of white residents of the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve, who are anxious to have their children attend the Indian day school on the reserve. It is noted that these parents are prepared to pay a nominal fee of $1.00 a month per child for the instruction of their children.\n\nYou are probably aware that the accommodation at the Caughnawaga schools is somewhat limited. This is particularly true of the larger schools in the village, where the accommodation at present is not sufficient to provide vocational instruction for a number of the senior pupils and a number of girls who have already completed the regular school course. You may be interested to learn that we have at the moment under consideration a request for the construction of an additional room suitable for instruction in manual training, home economics, etc. In view of this condition, the Department is of the opinion that it would be very unwise to enroll white pupils at the larger schools. As the Government's building program, other than buildings necessary for our war effort, has been suspended, we are convinced that in the days immediately ahead no additional space will be required to provide instruction for the Indian pupils on the reserve. A temporary arrangement, therefore, whereby instruction might be provided for certain white pupils, would in our judgment be scarcely fair to the teachers in charge of our schools or to the white pupils themselves.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. J. F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nMaxime Raymond, Esq., M.P.,\nMontreal, Que.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been requested by Mrs. Thomas Lazare of this Reserve to submit you the case of her grandchild, Johny Cowan, aged seven, who is of school age but who cannot attend the local schools as he has the status of white.\n\nMr. James Cowan is enlisted in the Active Service and is presently in England. He married Mrs. Lazare's daughter, Josephine, who lives with her on the Reserve together with her two children, one is four and the other seven.\n\nPrevious to her marriage Josephine was an Indian. When she married she lived at Lachine with her husband who up to the time of his enlistment was a member of the R.C.M.P., but after her husband left for overseas she came and resided on the Reserve with her mother and her father-in-law, Thomas Lazare, who is an invalid.\n\nMr. Lazare claims that as they are in destitute circumstances they are most anxious for Mrs. Cowans to remain with them on the Reserve as if she goes and lives elsewhere they will be compelled to apply for relief. At the present time Mrs. Cowans lives with them rent free and in return is supporting them. However if her son cannot attend school she will have to move out of the Reserve. As a matter of fact it is stated that she looked for a house in Montreal, Lachine and other places but could not find a suitable house except for prices ranging between $40.00 and $60.00 per month, which rentals she is unable to afford.\n\nWill you kindly let me know if due to the fact that Josephine, who was a Band member before her marriage, is married with an Active Service man who is supporting her parents and who is unable to find adequate lodgings could be given permission to send her son to School. It may be that due to the conditions above described the Department could do something in this particular case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6075, file 305-1, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, September 9, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Raymond:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of September 4, written by you on behalf of a number of white residents of the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve, who are anxious to have their children attend the Indian day school on the reserve. It is noted that these parents are prepared to pay a nominal fee of $1.00 a month per child for the instruction of their children.\n\nYou are probably aware that the accommodation at the Caughnawaga schools is somewhat limited. This is particularly true of the larger schools in the village, where the accommodation at present is not sufficient to provide vocational instruction for a number of the senior pupils and a number of girls who have already completed the regular school course. You may be interested to learn that we have at the moment under consideration a request for the construction of an additional room suitable for instruction in manual training, home economics, etc. In view of this condition, the Department is of the opinion that it would be very unwise to enroll white pupils at the larger schools. As the Government's building program, other than buildings necessary for our war effort, has been suspended, we are convinced that in the days immediately ahead of us additional space will be required to provide instruction for the Indian pupils on the reserve. A temporary arrangement, therefore, whereby instruction might be provided for certain white pupils, would in our judgment be scarcely fair to the teachers in charge of our schools or to the white pupils themselves.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. J. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nMaxime Raymond, Esq., M.P.,\nMontreal, Que.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 15, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant with reference to the request that you have received for the admission of Mrs. Cowan's son to the Caughnawaga School.\n\nAs you mention in your letter, this boy's father is a white man and consequently he takes his status. We have consistently refused to allow white children to attend the Caughnawaga Schools and consequently we cannot approve the admission of the Cowan boy.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Sept. 11, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nIn answer to your letter of September 5, 1941, File 5-1-1, we wish to advise you that after due consideration we have come to the conclusion that woodwork is not beneficial to our pupils. We believe that this is due to the small number of hours that can be given over to it (approximately four hours a month per pupil) thereby allowing sufficient time for the regular classwork. Of course, it would be an altogether different matter if the boys specialized in this sort of work.\n\nWe believe that this expense could be eliminated due to War conditions and no one here would be the loser since we are aware of the fact that practically all our Indians take up iron work after their schooling.\n\nAs previously understood, our classes will begin next Monday, September 15th.\n\nWe have been looking forward to a visit from you during the month of August. May we expect one soon?\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 18, 1941.\n\nDear Sister Jean de Dieu:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant in which you refer to teaching woodwork at the Caughnawaga School.\n\nI regret to state that the Department does not agree with you in regard to the teaching of woodwork. We feel that such instruction is beneficial and if we can possibly make arrangements for anyone to handle it it is our desire that the older boys be given the advantage of instruction in woodwork during the coming academic year. However, I must admit that we have not yet succeeded in securing anyone but we are still hopeful in this regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nSister Jean de Dieu,\nPrincipal,\nR.C. School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nYour letter of July last regarding the finding of a practical man to continue the wood work in the schools of Caughnawaga must have been mislaid without being read. I know that I received the proposed course of study, which I read with considerable interest. I find it very practical and systematic and well calculated to give the boys a good initiation into elementary shop work.\n\nYour letter of September 5th came to my address while I was in Quebec. Since my return, I have tried without success to find the man you want. The teachers who do this work in my inspectorate are all full time teachers in the various schools of the Montreal Catholic School Commission.\n\nYour request does not necessarily call for a teacher, but rather for a \"practical man\". However, as you know, the men who answer to this description are nearly all engaged in war industries.\n\nI have a suggestion to make, which I want you to know is made without any motive of personal interest. If you have not found any one for the work, I think that my father would be able to do it. Naturally, he is not a young man. He retired from the Montreal Railways Company in 1935. He had been for many years superintendent of construction and maintenance in the power department of that company. He is not a carpenter by trade, but an electrician and all-round mechanic. At present, he occupies his leisure by making and repairing fishing-rods. His hobby brings him a small profit.\nAs I said before, this suggestion is made with the idea of helping and not from personal interest. If you desire to communicate with my father, a letter will reach him if addressed as follows:\n\nE. E. Wescott,\n690e Clark Street,\nMontreal.\n\nConcerning remuneration, I would say that something like $10.00 per week plus transportation would be satisfactory. Transportation costs to and from Caughnawaga would amount to about $8.00 per month. Perhaps it would be better to fix a rate of $12.00 per week.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.E. Wescott,\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa, September 25th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been in communication with your son Mr. A. E. Wescott, Inspector of Schools, with reference to finding a practical man to continue the teaching of woodwork to the Indian pupils at the Caughnawaga R. C. Day School. Your son has suggested that you might be interested in this work, and we are prepared to allow an amount of $60.00 a month. This would include the cost of your transportation.\n\nMr. A. J. Doucet, of this Department, will be on the Caughnawaga Reserve on October 9th, and I would appreciate it if you would meet him at the Indian Agent's office on the Reserve about nine o'clock that morning. At that time you can discuss with him the duties that would be required, and he will be prepared to spend a few days with you to outline the course which we desire followed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. E. E. Wescott,\n6906 Clarke Street,\nMontreal, P.Q.\nJune 18, 1923.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Gabriel,\n\nYour letter of the 15th instant announcing your retirement from the Indian work at Caughnawaga came as a surprise. I have always appreciated very highly your work as Superintendent of the village schools, and I am glad that your connection with the Department is not to be completely severed. It is plain that your Superiors have also appreciated your great ability and intend to make use of it in a higher sphere. I am personally acquainted with the staffs at Kamloops, St. Mary's Mission and Rupert Island, and it will be a pleasure to me to render any service I can. I expect to be in British Columbia this summer, and I hope it may be possible to visit some of the schools. As you may be aware, we are about to ask for tenders for a new school building at Kamloops.\n\nWishing you every success in your new field of labour, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Gabriel,\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nOttawa, September 25th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has been decided to have Mr. Doucet visit the Oka and Caughnawaga Reserves early next month. He will reach Montreal West at ten o'clock, D.S.T., on the morning of October 6th, and it would be appreciated if you would meet him and take him to the Reserve. During the balance of the day you will visit the schools on the Reserve.\n\nMr. Doucet will accompany you to Oka on Tuesday, and spend Tuesday and Wednesday visiting the schools and giving advice to the teachers regarding the manual training which the Department desires taught during the current academic year.\n\nWe are communicating with a practical man in Montreal who, we believe, can be secured to teach woodwork at the Caughnawaga R.C. School this year. He will arrive on the Reserve on Thursday morning, and Mr. Doucet will remain with him for two or three days in order to give him some idea of the work that we desire carried out.\n\nYou should advise the Sister Superior regarding the action we are taking, and I feel certain that she will co-operate with us by following out any instructions that Mr. Doucet gives and by providing on the Time-table for the necessary period during which the boys selected will receive this training.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. F.

We have been informed also that the mother of the girl is a widow and is anxious to secure the help of the girl for the operation of a store. If the facts are as above stated and the mother of this pupil is making a sincere attempt to support herself, the Department might sympathetically and favourably consider this request.\n\nA full report on the case by you will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant dealing with the case of Annie Mayo who wishes to remain out of school for the balance of the present academic year.\n\nIn reply I wish to let you know that the mother kept her at home without any permission lately, and refused to allow her to attend school after having been notified several times by the truant officer. Mrs. Mayo was arrested and sentenced according to the Act, but her sentence was suspended after she promised to send her back to school.\n\nWith regard to this case I may say that at the time of her arrest, Mrs. Mayo, stated that she wanted to send her daughter to work outside\u2014there was no question then of the girl remaining at the store. However Mrs. Mayo is now informing that she would keep her daughter with her as help around the store.\n\nOwing to the age of the girl and the above mentioned I would recommend the granting of her request. It is hoped that this will not constitute a precedent and that others will not try to get the same permission because Mrs. Mayo obtained it.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSup't., of Welfare and Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nYours very truly\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nNovember 3, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to Annie Mayo. Provided this girl assists her mother in the store operated by the latter on the reserve, the Department approves of her being allowed to leave school. If, however, she intends to take work outside of the reserve the Department is not prepared to favour such action and, in that event, she should remain at school for the balance of the academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Briarbois,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nOur monthly salary came in last night. We thank you for it. It certainly seemed good to receive a salary after having been four months without one.\n\nOur two lay teachers have asked us to explain the presence of extra money in their pay check. For example, Miss Williams received $75.50 instead of the supposed $75.00 less the National Defence Tax etc. Would it be the Living Maintenance Fee for War Time? For our information, will you kindly explain this matter to us, telling us who has the right to receive this Living Maintenance, etc. This information would be very much appreciated.\n\nAnother matter we would like to call to your attention is the fact that since a few months, Doctor Jacobs has been sharing our telephone line, besides several other parties. We've never had any cause to complain but since these few months, it is practically impossible to have confidential talks over the phone either with our Indian agent, our Mother House, the fathers at the rectory, etc. There is always someone cutting in on the conversation; I mean someone listening in. Last night, we had a telephone conversation with Mr. Phelan and all the while we were speaking, the same interruption kept taking place. This is very inconvenient. Could you approve our having a private line?\n\nWe thank you, dear Mr. Hoey, for your kind attention to these matters and we beg you to believe us\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOttawa,\nNovember 5, 1941.\n\nDear Mr. Brisebois:\n\nI have a letter from the Sister Superior of the Caughnawaga School with reference to the telephone service at the teachers' residence. It appears that they are on a party line which includes several Indians who apparently make a habit of listening to the phone conversations from the teachers' residence.\n\nThis condition is extremely annoying and it has occurred to me that you might make arrangements with the Bell Telephone Company to have the phone in the Sisters' residence placed on a different line. For instance, it might be placed on the line with the phone in your office and residence. I should appreciate it if you would give this matter your immediate consideration and consult the Bell Telephone Company with a view to determining if satisfactory arrangements can be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois,\nIndian Agent,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nDear Sister:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant I am communicating with Indian Agent Brisebois with regard to the phone. It has occurred to me that it might be possible to arrange with the Bell Telephone Company to have a party line on which would be connected the Indian Agent's office, residence and your residence. This plan may not be feasible but, in any case, I know Mr. Brisebois will give the matter immediate consideration and endeavour to make arrangements to remedy the condition about which you complain.\n\nMiss Williams, who is an Indian, was engaged as teacher at the Caughnawaga R.C. School at a salary of $75.00 a teaching month. The Department of National Revenue has ruled that Indians employed on a reserve are not required to pay National Defence tax. Recently the Government provided a cost-of-living bonus. Miss Williams is eligible to receive this. 11% of $75.00 is $8.25, which makes her total monthly salary $83.25. From this amount is deducted 5% of the regular salary rate of $75.00, or $3.75, leaving a net amount of $79.50 payable to her monthly. The amount of $3.75 deducted monthly is placed in the retirement fund, interest allowed, and will be paid to Miss Williams when she leaves our employ.\n\nSome months ago the Sisters of St. Ann applied for exemption from payment of National Defence tax on the grounds that they turned their salary cheques over to the Order to which they belong and only received\n\nSister M. Jean de Dieu,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga R.C. School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\ntheir maintenance. It has been ruled that under such circumstances cost-of-living bonus cannot be paid.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant dealing with the telephone service at the Sisters residence and in reply I wish to let you know that communication has been sent to the Bell Telephone in order that the Sisters' phone be changed from its present line to that of the Agent's office.\n\nThis line will now deserve Dr. Hamel, the Agent's office and the Sisters. All three telephone being Departmental one.\n\nYours very truly\n\nIndian Agent\n\nH.A.

Anne in Caughnawaga should be changed from the present rural line to the two party line now serving Dr. Hamel and also your office.\n\nWhile I appreciate the inconvenience which the Sisters encounter as a result of other subscribers listening on their line, I regret that it would be impossible to change their telephone and to place them on the line now serving Dr. Hamel and yourself.\n\nThis difficulty would be due, first of all to equipment limitation and secondly, to the fact that we have no standard tariff for three party service, as our rates are made up to include only individual, two party and rural lines. If, the Sisters of Ste. Anne were placed on your line, it would mean that the line would automatically become a rural and additional subscribers would be added from time to time, as new applications were received.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nManager\n(K.V. Keirstead)\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to refer to previous correspondence dealing with the telephone service at this Agency and more particularly to the private line installed at this office.\n\nIn that connection I wish to advise that Dr. Hamel was recently connected on our line as he was encountering much difficulties on the line on which he had his telephone. He was on the same line as several taxi drivers and also Dr. Jacobs, and it was found that the latter used to keep his line open in order to prevent Dr. Hamel from getting his calls.\n\nDr. Hamel's telephone charges are made separately from those of this office as I understand his account is paid from the Medical vote and ours from Agency.\n\nRelative to the recent request that the Sister's telephone be connected on our line I may say that the Bell Telephone cannot accede to the Department's request and in this regard I am enclosing a letter from the Company outlining their reasons for not being able to comply.\n\nAt the same time I wish to point out that to add the Sister's telephone on our line would have been inconvenient as they are known to use the phone for long periods at the time.\n\nYours very truly\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent\nMontreal December 7th 1941\n\nMr. Philip Chelan\nTraining Division\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPlease find enclosed the forms which you requested me to fill out which I hope will be in order.\n\nVery Truly,\n\nE.B.

Day Schools at the Caughnawaga P.R. Indian Reserve also during the same period I conducted my Manual Training as usual on the Days which they occurred (i.e., Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.) Also supervised the work going on at the schools. My services were authorized by Mr. Hoey in a Letter to Mr. Brodeur Agent. During the half-year period beginning Jan 3rd 1942 to Feb 13th 1942 inclusive there were 17 extra days which were not Manual Training days for which I requested from the Agent Mr. Brodeur the payment of $5.00 per day amounting to the sum of $85.00. As I expected to receive my regular salary which would amount to $60.00 per month for Manual Training as follows:\n\nJanuary Salary Manual Training $60.00\nFebruary Salary Manual Training $60.00\n\nAmounting to the Sum of Total $120.00\n\nAs to the present date I have received one Check at the end of January amounting to $59.60 and at the end of February one...\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, March 13, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nWill you kindly allow me to be away from the Caughnawaga Schools from March 19 to 27 in order that I may follow the Retreat Exercises in Lachine?\n\nDue to the reorganization of the schools after the Senior School Fire, I was unable to follow the regular Retreat in February.

The only possible way we can adjust the matter is to increase your salary for the period January 1 to June 30 from $60.00 to $75.00 a teaching month. I trust that this arrangement will be satisfactory to you.\n\nI find that deductions of $4.00 a month for war savings certificates have been made from your salary for the months of December, January and February and a similar deduction will be made monthly for the same purpose unless you advise us to the contrary. You can realize that there are thousands of applications for these certificates each month and consequently there is some delay in issuing them but I have no doubt that you will receive all of yours in due course.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The accommodation at our disposal for the coming academic year will not permit accepting pupils of this age group on a full-time basis. It was, therefore, arranged that during the academic year 1942-43 pupils who are six years of age at the beginning of the term or reach that age during the term will be accepted on a half-day basis. The Sister Superior will work out this plan. This arrangement will avoid the necessity of renting another building and it is the best possible under present circumstances.

Others are also employed at the Canadian Canners at St.Isidore, Que., which is also near the Reserve.\n\nMay I say that there is a serious shortage of labour and that these employers had to employ children under 16 in order to prevent any waste of fruits and vegetables, which accounts for the fact that many indian children have gone to work until the last of October.\n\nHowever the Rev.Sister Superior seems to be opposed to their absence from School and has asked the Constable to go to the above mentioned places in order that the children in school age be dismissed from work. The Constable was instructed not to do anything before being advised by you.\n\nMay I say that I would favour, if agreeable to you, that these children be permitted to continue working up to the first of next month, owing to the present condition, and moreover if similar condition exists next year, the teachers should be instructed not to reopen the Schools before the last of October as it is of the utmost importance that everything be done to prevent any wastage. An early reply would be much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A.Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt., of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, September 18, 1942.\n\nRe: School Attendance\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 17th instant, in which you intimate that several boys and girls of school age are at present employed with the Empire Food Company; that a number of others are employed at the Canadian Canners at St. Isidore, Que., and that it is not at all likely that these pupils will report at school until on or about October 1.\n\nIn view of the acute labour shortage existing throughout the country and in view of the concessions already made by provincial departments of education, the Department is of the opinion that these pupils should be permitted to continue at the work in which they are now engaged until October 1. This decision applies particularly to senior pupils. You should inform the Principal of the school that these are critical times in which we are living and that this nation, together with other nations, is fighting for its very existence. You should point out to her, also, that Section 10 (subsection 5, paragraph 'c') of the Indian Act reads:\n\n\"No parent or other person shall be liable to such penalties if such child has been excused in writing by the Indian agent or teacher for temporary absence to assist in husbandry or urgent and necessary household duties\".\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nWe are enclosing herewith cheque No. 2029797, for $45.00, drawn in your favour. In this connection we wish to advise that salary for the period October 1st to December 31st was paid you at the rate of $60.00 per month instead of $75.00 as agreed.\n\nL.W. McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\nJanuary 15th., 1943.\n\nSister M. George's inquiry of January 14th., regarding War Savings Certificates might be replied to as follows:\n\nIt is evident that an error has been made in registering the four War Savings Certificates in the names of the four Sisters. The error would be in the pledges or at the office of the War Savings Committee where these Certificates are issued. Steps will be taken to see that all Certificates for the individuals of the Institution will be made out in the name of the Congregation des Soeurs de Sainte Anne in future.\n\nIt is evident that the May Certificates were received and our records indicate that 12 Certificates were issued from the June salaries and mailed on August 7th., to Rev. Mere Economie Generale, S.S.A., Mount St. Ann, Lachine, Que. All the Certificates sent out last week represented the amounts deducted from October salaries and it is expected that it will be some little time before the November and December Certificates are ready. Of the October Certificates, 10 were registered in the name of the Congregation des Soeurs de Sainte Anne and 4 registered in the names of the individual Sisters.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWe wish to thank you for your very kind wishes for 1943.\n\nWe are sorry that you were forced to cancel your trip to Caughnawaga on December 17th because of sickness. We had so many subjects to take up with you. However, we do hope that this trip is only a postponed one.\n\nMr. Gatien has left for army service. Mr. Robert is tending the fires of both schools pending Ottawa's decision for a new janitor. He, Mr. Robert, has been a little more civil for the last month. Thank God for the improvement!\n\nTuesday last, we received four registered letters, each one containing a War Saving Certificate issued to the following names:\n\n- Sister M. Alice-de-Jesus\n- Sister M. Carmella\n- Sister M. Leocadie\n- Sister M. Mediatrix\n\nWe were a little surprised to receive these since all War Saving Certificates bought by us are taken out in the name of: Congregation des Soeurs de Sainte Anne - 27 - 36 - 52 and forwarded directly to our general bursar at Mount Saint Ann, Lachine. As I had business with the general bursar yesterday, we remitted these four war certificates and found that no certificates except one alone, had been received since May, 1942. Our records show that deductions had been made from our salary for every teaching month namely, June, October, November and December. May we ask you to investigate this matter for us? Fourteen certificates ($4.00) should be issued to us per month.\nFurthermore, may we ask you to authorize the purchase of an Encyclopedia of Canada ($5.50) which we find will be very beneficial to both teachers and pupils here. This work consists of six volumes and contains a wealth of information on all subjects connected with the classroom.\n\nMay I also ask permission to be away from the Caughnawaga schools for five teaching days so that I may be able to follow the retreat exercises in Lachine? Sr. M. Alma or another sister will do my work while I am away.\n\nWe wish to thank you for your kind attention to all these matters.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nOttawa.\nDear Sister Mary George:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant and am pleased to know that Mr. Robert's services have been more satisfactory recently.\n\nWith reference to the war savings certificates, I am advised by the Treasury Branch that it is evident that the May certificates were received and our records indicate that 12 certificates were issued from the June salaries and mailed on August 7th, to Rev. Mere Economie Generale, S.S.A., Mount St. Ann, Lachine, Que. All the certificates sent out last week represented the amounts deducted from October salaries and it is expected that it will be some little time before the November and December certificates are ready. Of the October certificates, 10 were registered in the name of the Congregation des Soeurs de Sainte Anne and 4 registered in the names of the individual Sisters.\n\nI have noted your request for a set of Encyclopedia of Canada. Due to present conditions we are not providing such expensive books at the present time. Under these circumstances I regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to your request.\n\nPermission is granted for your absence from the school for 5 days to attend the retreat. It is noted that one of the other Sisters will take charge of your work during your absence.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSister Mary George,\nPrincipal,\nR.C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nR.A.

Mere Economie Generale, S.S.A.,\nMount St. Ann, Lachine, Que.\n\nThe October Certificates were sent by registered mail on January 11th., 1943, addressed as follows: Four to the individual Sisters (which have been received), One Certificate by registered letter No. 3831 addressed to Sisters of St. Ann, Lachine, Que., nine Certificates by registered letter No. 3777 addressed to Rev. Mere Economie Generale, S.S.A., Mount St. Ann, Lachine, Que. Had these registered letters not been delivered, they would have been returned before this.\n\nThe receipt of registered letters No. 2111 and 3777 should be carefully checked at Lachine as apparently the Principal at Caughnawaga has found a record of registered letter No. 3831 and not the other two which were similarly addressed.\n\nIt would not be possible to have deductions for fourteen individuals combined in one Certificate as suggested.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have no records of their receipt.\n\nAs for the October certificates, the four issued to individual sisters were received here in Caughnawaga and our General Bursar received one and not ten as specified in your letter. Therefore, there are still nine missing from the October issue. Would it be too much to ask you to take up this matter again with the Treasury Branch and would you kindly ask them to issue all fourteen certificates paid from our salaries to Reverende Mere Eoonome Generale, Mount Saint Ann, Lachine, Que. This will mean just one bulk issue every month and would facilitate matters.\n\nIs your visit really cancelled? There would be so many questions to be answered here. The janitor situation is better in one way but not an ideal one to tend with, I assure you. We are living in hopes.\n\nThanking you for your kindness in this matter and also for all past favors, we beg to remain\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R. A.

McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nRev. Sister M. Jean de Dieu,\nCare Sister Mary George,\nPrincipal, R.C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nWe acknowledge receipt of your letter dated March 31st with reference to the equipment for the Domestic Science Room here.\n\nI am sorry to note that you seem to find that we have been extravagant in the purchase of the necessary articles. May I assure you, Mr. Phelan, that I have bought only those articles which were approved on the submitted list and even at that, when I found prices unreasonable, I did not purchase the article at all, e.g. the kitchen cabinet which would have cost at least $150.00. The counters were also very high so I purchased the lumber and Mr. Wescott and his men built them up for us at about one-third the quoted price.\n\nI have spent long days scouting the city for advantageous prices on serviceable equipment. I admit that equipping a kitchen for the use of twelve (12) girls requires the purchase of many pots and pans, cutlery etc. I, myself, had no idea that the project would cost as much as it did for I would not have proposed it at this critical time. However, I am encouraged by the thought that this project will be a means of keeping our young girls interested in schoolwork and will keep them from much moral danger outside. Furthermore, every bit of the equipment purchased, will be transferrable to new quarters if ever a new school is built for the Caughnawaga children.\n\nMany of our girls of fourteen and fifteen have left school for work. We have tried every expedient to get them back to class but uselessly. The reopening of the Domestic Science Room is my only hope now. Some of these\nGirls are working in places where they are very exposed morally and physically. They are not yet strong enough to withstand the fatigue caused by the work assigned them. Most of the mothers will not listen to reason being tempted by the few extra dollars coming into the house. It is sad to have to stand by and see our nice young girls being destroyed. No matter what it will cost me, I am decided to try to remedy the situation here in Caughnawaga, if possible. We cannot count on Mr. Jocks to help us to keep our pupils in school. People are not afraid of him and they are very prone to speak about his public scandalous conduct. As a help, would you write me a strong letter to the effect that pupils who are not fifteen may not go to work so that I may use it when needed. To give it still more value, probably Mr. Brisebois could read it to the pupils in school.\n\nYou may be interested to know that the Woodwork Department has kept about 90% of our big boys in school while the girls registration has dwindled from 19 in October to 5 in March. If you have any other suggestion, I would be very grateful for it.\n\nAs soon as all the work in the Domestic Science and the Woodwork rooms is completed, I hope to arrange for a special demonstration and I trust that either you or Mr. Hoey will be able to be present. I am ready to cooperate with you in every respect.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nOttawa.\nCopy sent to Sister Mary George\n\nOttawa,\nApril 13, 1943.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois, Indian Agent, Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nAs you are aware, the compulsory age for attendance of Indian children at Indian day schools on a reserve is 7 to 16 years. It has been brought to our attention that many of the girls of 14 and 15 years of age on the Caughnawaga Reserve who should be attending school have quit in order to obtain work.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would point out to both parents and children that the Department expects the girls to take advantage of the educational facilities provided for them at the Caughnawaga schools. Children who leave school as young as those just mentioned will not likely return to school and, therefore, will not have the training which they will require in after years. Consequently the Department feels that their education should not be neglected simply for a temporary advantage.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department has re-established the domestic science room at the Caughnawaga R.C. School and, as a result, excellent training can be given to the girls in this class of work in addition to their academic work.\n\nI trust that your interest in this matter will have the effect of keeping the teen-age girls in school.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, June 2, 1943.\n\nThe Commissioner, The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Ottawa\n\nIn confirmation of telephone conversation with Superintendent Darlin I have to advise you that this Branch was informed this morning by Sister Mary George, Principal of the Caughnawaga Indian Roman Catholic School, that the school known as the Kateri Indian Day School in the village of Caughnawaga was broken into and a considerable amount of supplies and equipment stolen.\n\nI shall be obliged if you will please have this matter thoroughly investigated and advise me further in connection therewith in due course.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJune 4, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. HOEY\n\nAs requested, I visited the Caughnawaga Reserve in connection with the report we had received regarding the robbery at the Kateri School.\n\nI found that, acting on the request of Dr. McGill, the R.C.M.P. had visited the school on the afternoon of Wednesday, June 2, and made a very exhaustive examination of the building, especially the domestic science room. I also understand they interviewed one or two people but no information was available regarding any information they obtained from them.\n\nIt appears that when the Sisters went to the school on the morning of May 31 they found some small branches of trees and a number of burnt matches in several of the rooms. They reported the incident to the Indian office. However, Agent Brisebois was absent on duty at the Oka Reserve.\n\nOn Wednesday morning when they reached the school it was found that approximately $150.00 worth of equipment had been taken from the domestic science room. This included electric toaster, iron, dishes, cutlery, scissors, thread etc. Investigation also showed that whoever entered the school had visited a number of the classrooms and stolen fountain pens, chalk and even a map of North America and burnt matches were strewn around the place. In addition, the handles on the taps of the water system leading to the boiler had been removed. Further investigation showed that the burglars had entered the building by the fire escape and had gained admittance by removing a pane of glass from the door at the top of the fire escape. It was informed by the Rev. Sister that the police had found some minor clues and they also took several impressions in an endeavour to obtain fingerprints.\n\nThe Rev. Sister advised me that there had been several minor robberies throughout the village in the last few months.\n\nI understand that our Branch has been negotiating with the R.C.M.P. with a view to placing one or more officers on the reserve. I was informed that Mrs. Paul Paul has a very nice residence that is situated a short distance from the former Agency office. Mrs. Paul intends to reside with her married daughter on another part of the reserve and it is quite possible that her own residence could be secured as a residence for the R.C.M.P.\nFrom reports received it is evident that the present constable has survived his usefulness and it also appears very necessary that when a community as large as Caughnawaga Village is situated close to the largest city in Canada adequate police protection should be provided.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Brisebois, Esq., Indian Agent, Caughnawaga, Quebec.\n\nI have to refer to the recent robbery at the Caughnawaga School, and conditions on the reserve.\n\nMr. Phelan, Chief, Training Division, in a report to the Superintendent of Welfare and Training has drawn attention to a house belonging to Mrs. Paul Paul that he was informed would make a satisfactory residence for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer.\n\nWill you kindly let me have a report by early mail?\n\nDirector.\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nJune 10, 1943.\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill, Director, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI have to refer to your letter of the 7th instant dealing with the recent robbery at the Caughnawaga School and conditions on the Reserve and in this connection to say that the R.C.M.Police are actually investigating these thefts and have strong suspicions on three young Indians. I understand warrants will be taken out against these parties.\n\nWith regard to the house of Mrs. Paul Paul as a suitable residence for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer, I may say that this woman was interviewed. On that occasion she stated that her house was not for rent, but however if the Department wants that house she would rent for a period not exceeding five years at an annual rental of $500.00. Moreover if improvements are made she does not want to have same deducted from her rent. There is no water in that house but there is a well on the property.\n\nThis house is an old stone house similar to the former Agency's building but in very good order. However the rental asked is considered exorbitant.\n\nI am trying to find other places which would be suitable but apparently the Indian owners seem to be afraid to rent to an R.C.M.Police as they have the wrong idea that they would be treated severely and are apparently afraid to be blamed by other Indians for the coming of Mounted Police, if they rent their properties.\n\nIt is my opinion that if an unmarried R.C.M.Police officer could be appointed for six months or a year, who could reside at the house used as Agency's office, it would convince the property owners that the Mounted Police officers are not to persecute them...but\nbut to protect the population. It is believed that it would then be possible to find quarters for a married man.\n\n(Frs. Brisebois)\nIndian Agent.\nAfter questioning John Latour, I am quite sure that this person knows something about the theft, as he was quite nervous when being questioned. I would suggest that he be brought into H.Q., and questioned alone, without being interfered by his parents. May the necessary instructions in this connection be given please.\n\nThe wallet mentioned in paras. 2 and 7 of this report will be returned to the owner Andrew DeLisle, as I do not believe that this young lad had anything to do with the theft.\n\nS.U.I. Expenses incurred.\n\n(M.T.Laberge) Reg.No.11528.\n\nTHE COMMISSIONER,\nR.C.M.P. OTTAWA.\n\nFor your information and that of the Dept. concerned. This has reference to the D.C.I.'s memorandum dated June 5th.\n\nEnquiries to date have revealed four suspects, namely: Andrew DeLisle, Joseph Diabo, John and Richard Latour. DeLisle has been eliminated and John Latour appears as the most logical suspect. The domiciles of the Latours and Diabo have been searched without success. Taking into consideration the mentality of the Indians on this Reserve it is believed that after sometime information will be forthcoming from some of them, out of revenge or otherwise. I have instructed Cpl. Laberge to bring in John Latour for further questioning. Although Sister Superior George has no faith in S/Cst. Jocks, his assistance is being requested as he may wish to re-establish himself in the good graces of his employers, the Dept. of Indian Affairs, by cleaning up this case. At any rate, we have nothing to lose in so doing, unless the Janitor can be considered a suspect; this angle is not disregarded in view of some of the circumstances reported in paragraph two. I am taking up this angle with the N.C.O. charged with this case.\n\nFurther report will follow.\n\nD.D. 15-7-43\n\nMontreal\n18-6-43\n2 /JR\n\n(H.A.R. Gagnon) SUPT.,\nCommanding \"C\" Division.\nPara. 7 continued/\nHe was questioned about his wallet, he said that he had lost it and that he did not know where, that he had looked for it but could not find it. He was shown the one that was found and he identified it as his own, but could not state how it happen to be found in between the two doors, he further stated that he arrived home around 8:30 P.M. and went right to bed. June DeLisle was then interviewed, she stated that after school on the 31st she came right home and even on the night before, to help her mother to paint the floors and then went to bed. Mrs. Joseph DeLisle verified both of the children's statements.\n\n8. On seeing the attitude taken by the Sister Superior, in connection with S/Cst. Jogeks, I deemed it unwise to see him, also because the janitor of the school boards at Jocks home. In connection with the janitor he arrives at the school around 7 in the evening cleans up and leaves around 9:30 P.M. the same evening.\n\n5-6-43\n\n9. On the A.M. of this date, a telephone call was received from Sister George, requesting that I see her at noon. On arriving at Caughnawaga, Sister George informed me that a Mrs. Sayler, had informed her, that around 4 A.M. on the morning of June 2nd., she happened to be looking out of her window, there she saw John Latour coming from the direction of the school house and that he looked very suspicious, as he was walking and running along the ditch and fences, she could not state whether he was carrying anything, or was he accompanied by any other person. I was asked not to interview this party, as she was quiet old and if the young men who were responsible for the theft, knew that she had given any information, they might cause her some harm.\n\n10. Sister George also informed me that John Latour had a brother by the name of Richard and that both of these young men pal around with Joseph Diabo, the 3 of them range around 17 years of age. Both the Latour boys are also of loose character, as in the case of Diabo. The two Latour boys live in a small shack very close by the Kateri School, they have no parents on the Reserve, the mother having died and father remarried and his present address is unknown. Joseph Diabo lives with his parents \"Jos. Diabo\" opposite the Nun's residence on the Reserve.\n\n11. Returning to Montreal, the information was handed over to Insp. Lemieux, who instructed to obtain Search Warrants to search the premises of the Latours and Diabo.\n\n12. On the 5th inst., accompanied by Cst. Dubois, the domiciles of the Latours and Diabo were searched respectively at 10.05 and 10.45 A.M. but no signs of the stolen goods were found in either premises. John Latour was questioned after being warned, but he denied knowing anything about the theft, his brother Richard was not at home, but he was questioned at his work, at the Boyce Lumber Co., Ville St.Pierre, P.Q., he also denied any knowledge of the theft. It was impossible to question Joseph Diabo, as his mother did not know where he could be located. No statements were taken from the party questioned as same would be worthless at the present. P.T.O.\nof the door was examined for finger prints, a few smudges were found on same, but useless to be photographed, search was also made on other objects, particular attention was made of the cabinet, but nothing could be found there.\n\n4.

George was asked if she suspected anybody besides the owner of the wallet, mentioned in para. 2, Andrew DeLisle age 9, son of Joseph DeLisle. To this she replied that she suspected the sister of Andrew, June DeLisle age 14. She suspected her, because she did not like the manner in which she carried herself in school. She also suspected Joseph Diabo, whose character is not of the best on the Reserve.\n\n6. Superior George was asked if she had reported the matter to the local Sp/Cst. Jocks, to which she replied, that she had not, as it was useless to report anything to him as he protected those who did wrong, instead of bringing them to Justice.\n\n7. Leaving the school, we proceeded to interview Jos. DeLisle, father of Andrew and June DeLisle. He was questioned about the actions of his two children on the night of the theft, he stated that both had been home all evening, the son having gone to bed around 8.30 P.M. and June helped her mother to paint the floors and when he arrived around 10 P.M. they were both in bed. When the father was question neither one of the children were present. I then went to the home of the two children, were both were questioned separately. Andrew stated that on the evening of the 31st, after church he was playing tag, with some other children in the school yard, that he and the others were running up the fire escape, but that neither he nor the other children entered the school by that door.\n\nP.T.C.\nRe: Theft of Dishes and Cutlery,\nKateri Domestic Science School, Caughnawaga, I.O.\nProperty of Dept. of Indian Affairs.\nC.C. of C. AMENDED TO: Alleged Breaking & Entering\nKateri Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nJune 5th 1943\n\nOn above date accompanied by Cst. Plouffe, I proceeded to Caughnawaga and interviewed Mr. Laplante, Asst. Indian Agent, in the absence of Mr. Brisebois the Indian Agent. Mr. Laplante informed me that the above school had been broken into and several articles from the Domestic Science Room had been stolen. The articles stolen were the property of the Dept. of Indian Affairs. I was instructed to interview the Sister Superior for further information.\n\nSister Superior George, of the Congregation of Ste. Anne, was interviewed, and she stated, \"that on the A.M. of May 28th, it was reported to her by another Nun, that the fire escape door on the second floor of the school house, had been forced and that the desks in the class rooms, had been rearranged but they could not find anything missing, with the exception of a few red marking pencils. On the A.M. of the 30th ult., they again found that the same fire escape door had again been forced, they again investigated and found nothing missing. On the morning of the 1st inst., this same door was again forced and opened and after investigating they found that a set of Rogers cutlery \"Silverware\" and excessories, 1 Electric Toaster, 1 Electric Iron and a few other kitchen utensils were missing from the Domestic Science Room, which is situated in the basement of the Kateri School. They also found on this occasion a black wallet, belonging to one of the pupils, namely Andrew Delisle, this wallet was found in between the inner and outer door leading to the fire escape, also the desks in the classrooms were opened and about $3.00 in cash, which was in a box taken out. Sister George immediately notified the Indian agent, but in his absence the information was given to Mr. Laplante the Asst., She also called the Dept., at Ottawa and notified them. On the A.M. of the 2nd inst., the same fire escape door was found opened, this time the culprits, took out the putty around a small glass, took the glass out and unhooked the door, after investigating they found that the person or persons had visited the Domestic Science Room, having entered same by taking the lock off the door, incidently the Sister informed me that this door was not locked, and there was no reason why the lock was taken off, on entering the room they found burnt matches all over the floor and that a 16 piece service \"Dinner\" set, was missing from the cabinet and several other pieces of kitchen utensils. On the floor in front the cabinet they found that the floor was covered with clipped paper \"excelsior\" packing. I was informed that this paper was the paper which packed the dishes in when they received them, that same had been stored in the furnace room in boxes and that the boxes were also missing. After the theft the culprits left by the basement door.\"\n\nWe proceeded to the school in question and examined the premises, the small glass taken out of the door.\n\nP.T.O.\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\nHEADQUARTERS\n\nOUR FILE NO. 43-D-1274-3-D-4\n\nOTTAWA.

Guerin for sentence, both accused were released on Parole and instructed to report back before the Judge on October 15th 1943, they were also instructed by the presiding Judge to return the articles which had not been recovered.\n\nThe presiding Judge took for granted that the two accused were only 17 years of age and that they were Indians, thus the reason of not giving them a jail sentence.\n\nOn the afternoon of the 25th inst., I proceeded to Caughnawage, P.Q., to recover the articles which were still missing, but on my arrival at that point I was informed that these two young men had not returned home. On the evening of the same date I again returned to the Reserve and there contacted the two young men and the following articles were returned to me:- 1 Electric Toaster \"Hotpoint\", 1 Food Chopper, 1 Bread Knife, 10 Paring Knives, 2 sets of Measuring Spoons and 1 Screw Driver, these articles were brought to H.Q., and placed in the Bond with the other articles which were recovered on the 21st inst.\n\nAt the present time most of the articles have been recovered, there only remains a few smaller pieces and these two young men do not know what they did with them, as to the money ($3.00) mentioned in paragraph two (2) of my P.C.R. of the 5th inst., both of them deny taking same.\n\nIn view of the above I would suggest that this file be considered as closed and that instructions be given to return the articles to Sister Superior George at Caughnawage, P.Q., may I be instructed please.

For your information and that of the Department concerned together with report dated June 22nd and two sets of P. 246.\n\n2. After an extensive and intelligent investigation, Cpl. Laberge assisted by Det. Ogier of the Quebec Provincial Police has succeeded to recover most of the articles stolen by John Curette and Gilbert LEBORCHE two young Indians (17 years old). The Quebec Provincial Police charged them with B.E. & T. (para. 12) and pleas of \"guilty\" were entered. The sentences rendered by Judge Guerin are rather disappointing and the reason for the leniency shown was their age.\n\n3. Will you please instruct if it will be in order to return the articles recovered to Sister Superior George, at Caughnawaga, P.Q. and submit P. 246-A in order to close this file. Please note para. 2, report dated June 22nd. It is considered that the action taken in this case will have a good effect amongst the young Indians on this Reserve although a short jail term for CUROTTE and LEBORCHE would have had still a better effect.\n\nH.A.R.

With reference to the above and your instructions of the 18th inst., on my P.C.R. of the 5th inst., I beg to report that on this date, accompanied by S/Cst. Lafrenne, I proceeded to Caughnawaga, P.Q., to pick up one of the suspects John LaTour and bring him to Montreal H.Q., for questioning in connection with this B. & E., I was unable to find him as he had left the reserve earlier that date and had gone into town, at his home I was unable to find out where he had gone.\n\n2. Whilst at the Reserve I made inquiries in connection with the School Janitor Albini Robert, I was informed that he had arrived in Caughnawaga about 18 years ago from St. Boniface, Man., that at one time he was a member of some Brothers Congregation, that he was worth around $70,000.00, owning quite a bit of property out West and in vicinity of Montreal and District. I was also informed that this person is somewhat of a miser and deals quite a bit with the Indians on the Reserve, by buying things from them and selling them to others at a profit, he also finances the Indians there at a profit. I was speaking to Sister Superior George about this person and she informed me that he had received his notice, that his term of engagement with the Dept., terminated in July of this year and that she hoped that he would not be reengaged, seeing the business he was carrying on with the Indians.\n\n19-6-43\n\n3. On this date I happened to go to the Que. Prov. Police H.Q., and there I was informed by Det. A. Oglier, that he was working on a B. & E. case at the Kanawaki Golf Club, which is located on the Reserve and that he suspected the same persons as I did in the School Affair. Seeing this it was decided to work together on the two B. & E. This same day I again proceeded to Caughnawaga and there questioned John LaTour, he denied having anything to do with either B. & E., we questioned several others namely Joseph Blain, William Lahache and Mrs. Angus Lahache but none of these persons knew anything about the matter.\n\n4. The assistance of S/Cst. Jocks was then asked, he could not throw any light on the matter, but informed us that a party by the name of John Currie was going around the Reserve armed with a revolver, this party was located at the Convent in the act of bargaining with the Janitor Albini Robert to buy the revolver which was in his possession. Currie was immediately placed under arrest by Det. Oglier, C.P.P., for being in possession of a firearm and brought back to the City and placed in the C.P. Police cells, pending his arraignment on the 21st inst. It was then decided to leave this man in the cells over the week-end before questioning him any further. As to the revolver he claims that he had received it from an unknown man, who asked him to sell it for him, but it was ascertained from S/Cst. Jocks, that this revolver had been stolen out of the house of a party named Beauvais.\n\nP.T.O.\n5. On the A.M. on this date I proceeded to the H.Q. of the Q.P. Police and there questioned John CUROTTE in the presence of Det. Ogger, he admitted having entered the Golf Club on two occasions, namely the night of June 17th and 18th 1943 and had stolen several tools, etc., he also admitted to me that he had entered the Kateri School House on the night of June 1st - 2nd 1943, but that he had only gone in there after some other persons had broken into the place, he told me that he had stolen several small articles, namely 2 Maps, 1 Fountain Pen, Pencils, 6 Shirts, 1 Punch, 1 Mackinaw, 1 Screwdriver, 1 piece of Sealing Wax, 4 prs. Scissors, Crochet Needles, 1 Can Opener and 1 set of measuring spoons, he claimed that he had all these articles at home in his room, with the exception of 2 shirts which he had given away to persons he did not know and that the measuring spoons he had given them to Mrs. Alex RICE.\n\n6. During the questioning he admitted having broken into the Golf Club with Gilbert LEBORGNE, but he denied that this party accompanied him when he entered the School House. He denied having stolen the Dinner Set, the Silverware and other articles previously mentioned in my report of the 5th inst.\n\n7. Proceeding to Caughnawaga, P.Q. with Dets. Ogger and Jean Page, we picked up Gilbert LEBORGNE at his home, he admitted having entered the Golf Club with John CUROTTE, but denied having anything to do with the School Theft. We then proceeded to the home of John CUROTTE and there found in his room on the second floor the tools stolen from the Golf Club also the articles which he claimed that he had stolen from the School with the exception of 1 Screw Driver, 4 prs Scissors and Crochet Needles.\n\n8. We then went to the home of Mrs. Alex RICE and there she gave me the measuring spoons which CUROTTE had given her, before leaving her I questioned this person, whether she had bought any articles from this party, she claimed that she had bought a Dinner Set for 8 persons, 1 Set of Rogers Silverware 12 pieces, 2 Berry Spoons, 7 Crochet Needles and 3 pkgs. Embroidery Needles, these articles were handed over to me and she claimed that she bought nothing else. Mrs. Rice paid $5.00 for the dishes and $9.00 for the Silverware. Before leaving this person she informed me that the party across the street had also bought some dishes.\n\n9. Proceeding across the street I questioned Mrs. Annie MONTGOMERY (widow) she claimed that she did not understand me, I then had Gilbert LEBORGNE enter to interpretate for me, finally she pointed to a corner in the kitchen and in which I found a box with contained a set of Dinner Dishes for 8 persons, she claimed that she did not know to whom they belonged or how they got there, the dishes were then taken along with me. I then proceeded to the Convent and there Sister Superior George identified all the articles which I then had in my possession, as being the articles which were stolen from the school house.\n\n10. We then proceeded back to Montreal and JOHN CUROTTE was again questioned, he then admitted having stolen all the P.T.C.\nstolen all the\nfrom the School and that he was assisted by Gilbert LEBORGNE\nin committing the theft. Gilbert LEBORGNE was then questioned\nand he admitted having been with CUROTTE on the theft.\nCUROTTE was then questioned about the articles which had not\nbeen recovered, he stated that he had sold the Electric Iron\nto Napoleon CUROTTE, the Electric Toaster to Mrs. Annie MONTOUR,\nthe cheaper silverware to Joe LEBORGNE and that he had given\nand sold to different other persons other small articles, but\nhe did not remember to whom he had sold them.\n\n11. Returning to Caughnawaga accompanied by Cst.\nJ. Cowan, I recovered the cheaper silverware from Mrs. Joe\nLEBORGNE, but these articles had been transferred to her\nmother's home Mrs. Angus LAHACHE on the St. Isidore Road. The\nIron was recovered from Napoleon CUROTTE, but at Mrs. Annie\nMONTOUR'S she and her daughter denied having received the\nToaster, the daughter admitted having bought the Dinner set\nfrom CUROTTE, at the time he claimed that he had won same at\na Fair. The Iron and cheaper silverware was identified by\nthe Nuns as their property.\n\n12. John CUROTTE appeared on the A.M. of the 21st\ninst. for Illegal possession of Firearms, he pleaded Guilty,\nthis accused and Gilbert LEBORGNE appeared before Judge C.B.\nGuerin at Montreal on the afternoon of the 21st inst., on two\ncharges of B.& E. and Theft, namely the Golf Club and the\nSchool house, charges being laid by the Que. Prov. Police, they\nboth pleaded Guilty and the case was remanded to June 25th\nfor sentence, in the meantime the two accuseds being sent\nto jail.\n\n13. In view of the fact that most of the prin-\ncipal articles have been recovered with the exception of the\nElectric Toaster, leaving besides that the Food chopper, 5\nGal. Iron Pails, 6 prs Scissors, 2 Bread Knives, 1 set of\nMeat Knives, 2 doz paring knives and a few of other small\nkitchen utensils, I would suggest that this file be closed,\nbecause I am quite sure now that none of these articles will\nbe recovered, as the persons who have them will dispose of\nthe articles, knowing that we have already found some of the\ngoods.\n\n14. Attached hereto please find F. 246 covering\nthe articles which have been recovered, may I be advised please\nif these articles can be returned to the rightful owners, now\nthat the culprits have been arrested and pleaded guilty, your\ninstructions are awaited in this connection.

It will be noted that the Quebec Provincial Police assisted in this investigation, which resulted in breaking, entering and theft charges being laid by a member of that force against John Curotte and Gilbert Leborgne, Indian youths of the Caughnawaga Indian Reserve, seventeen years of age.\n\n3. Pleas of guilty were entered by both of the accused, and Judge C. Guerin, presiding justice, saw fit to release them on parole, ordering them to report to him on October 15th, 1943. The boys also entered pleas of guilty to a charge of breaking, entering and theft from the golf club on the reserve limits, and were dealt with by the judge as previously mentioned. The penalty imposed by Judge Guerin does not seem commensurate with the offence.\n\n4. The greater part of the goods that were stolen have been recovered, and a copy of form 246 listing same thereon is also enclosed. I presume it will now be in order to return these articles to the Sister Superior in charge of the Kateri School.\n\nH.

Mediatrix is replaced by Sr. M. Jeanne-du-Crucifix; Sister M. Lucie is replaced by Sister M. Rose-Dorothy; Sister M. Edward is replaced by Sr. M. Yvonne-Theresa; Sister Dorothy Hertle is named for St. Regis, therefore she will be replaced by Sr. Marie, a former Caughnawaga teacher.\n\nThe Mounted Police have returned most of the stolen articles for which we are grateful. We still hope for the remainder.\n\nAnswering your letter re file 5-1-4, with reference to Canadian Problem & Practice Arithmetic, we would require 50 books for Grades 3 & 4; 25 books for Grades 5 & 6 and 75 books for Grades 7 & 8 or\n\n50 Book I\n25 # II\n75 # III\n\nWe would appreciate receiving 50 copies each of the Canadian Individual Arithmetics A, B, and C. We find these work books of great advantage to the children.\n\nRegarding the 50 Ink Blanks for classroom preparations, these were black-covered ink books which the teachers use for their class preparation. In fact, any ink blank (heavier than the Maple Leaf) will do for this purpose.\nAccording to all appearances, the fall registration is going to be quite heavy. We are planning how to accommodate all these children. However, we will wait until they are in before really worrying.\n\nThe paint job on the front verandah has transformed the residence. We are so grateful for this. The ice-box has been repaired several times since your last visit without much result.\n\nIs the janitor position soon to be given out? I am awaiting further information before having the schools washed or would you rather that special help be hired to do this work immediately since the opening of class is only three weeks off?\n\nThe Gestetner Stencils have already arrived so the remainder of the requisition will be coming in soon.\n\nWe wish to thank you for all your kind attention to these matters and beg to remain\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan, Chief of Education,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nAugust 13, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Caughnawaga R.C.

Day School\nNo. 305\n\nIn my memorandum of the 12th instant I advised you of certain changes at the above-mentioned school for the coming academic year. I now enclose T.D. 1 form and cost-of-living bonus form for each of the new teachers. The staff questionnaire for each of them will be forwarded to you shortly.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Sister Mary George:\n\nWith reference to the attached war savings pledge cards which were sent in by the four new teachers, I would point out that the previous cards were issued in favour of the Congregation of Saint Ann rather than in the name of the individual Sister. I presume that you wish the same procedure adopted in the new instances, but such information will have to be entered on the pledge forms. May I also point out that each of these should be signed by the Sister concerned in the space marked \"X\".\n\nI am returning the forms which you previously sent and also new forms for the teachers concerned to complete.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nSister Mary George,\nPrincipal,\nR.C.

The Compulsory School Attendance Law for Montreal obliges them (those of 14 or under) to return to school immediately.

We've moved four classes in an effort to give everybody breathing space and we have asked Mr. Brisebois for additional desks and chairs. Would it be possible to hire an extra Indian teacher to help with the work in this first class? Besides that, Miss Saylor who has been doing splendid teaching for the past four years, is tempted to leave us in order to earn more money elsewhere. Mr. Phelan, would it not be possible to give her an increase of $100.00 per year? She is now getting $65.00 per month. She is practically the sole support of her mother and of her brother.\n\nSr. M.

Summer visitors have been tolerated for six months and then after being on the Reserve for six months, have dragged along until the following summer and then started another six months until they have become more or less permanent.\n\nAll of these various \"visitors\", I am told, have finally formed a small French community sufficiently large to require a French Canadian School. I am also informed that, of course, the Indian Agent, being a French-Canadian, has many visitors which all swells the French-Canadian population. I have been asked to point out to you that the Council understands that some of the equipment used for the proposed school belongs to the Indian Department and should be used for the benefit of the Indian pupils.\n\nIt has been particularly stressed to me that there is no race feeling against French, English or any other race but the Indians feel that Caughnawaga is an Indian Reserve and should be retained intact as such.\n\nPlease advise,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She has at present 12 pupils. There is positively no equipment belonging to the Department of Indian Affairs used for the benefit of these children. Mrs. Rice started to teach these children at the request of their parents who although living here could not send their children to the local Schools and were unable to send them Ville-Leselle nor Lachine as the Schools of the two Towns are full to capacity. May I say that another Indian woman Mrs. Margaret Regis was giving private lessons to white pupils last year but discontinued this year. Mrs. Rice merely replaced her. I am enclosing a list of the pupils of Mrs. Rice.\n\nAs Mrs. Rice is a member of this Band selling her services to white people, as a merchant would sell his goods or a workman his time or skill, and that she does not run a bona fide school but gives private courses it is not believed that she can prevented to do so, as she uses her residence and not a building which should be classified as a school house.\n\nAs to Mr. Werry's statement that I have many visitors who are swelling the French Canadian population, I may say that when I have outside visitors coming for an evening or a day at my home they do swell the population for the time that they spend at my home but as they only come for short visits it is not the Councillors' business nor his own. This statement could be understood coming directly from the Councillors but not from a so-called serious lawyer.\n\n(Tps.Brisebois)\nOttawa, September 22, 1943.\n\nEX D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I refer to your letter to this Department dated September 9 and my reply thereto dated September 13, 1943?\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Brisebois, in which he states that no attempt has been made to organize a school district or to establish a public school on the Caughnawaga reserve at any time. The Indian Agent points out, however, that Mrs. Albert Rice, a member of the Caughnawaga Band, is at present providing tuition for 12 pupils. Of these pupils, five are French speaking and seven English speaking. However, the course of instruction provided is English. It would appear also, from the information supplied us, that Mrs. Margaret Regis gave somewhat similar instruction to a group of Indians last year. Mr. Brisebois, in commenting upon the instruction that has been provided until now, states: \"Mrs. Rice is a member of this Band, selling her services to white people as a merchant would sell his goods or a workman his time or skill. She does not operate a school but provides private courses and uses her own residence for this purpose.\"\n\nMr. Brisebois concludes his letter with the statement that an attempt has been made by the parents of these children to send them to Ville Lasalle and Lachine but that the schools at these points are now full to capacity.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDirector.\n\nRoyal E.

However, we have made her understand that it is not the Department's custom to hire married women but we are submitting the matter to you for decision.\n\nMr. Bush is a little worried for he has received no salary at all since he began work for us on October 14th. Will you kindly see to this matter also?\n\nOur General Prefect of English Studies is presently examining the Caughnawaga classes. We will ask her to make a report to the Department at the close of her visit.\nThe furnace at the Kateri School has been out of order for the past three days. We have been forced to have the girls stay home, providing them with plenty of written work.\n\nMost of our truants are now back in school. We are certainly getting 100% cooperation from the M.P.'s, who are real gentlemen and who will eventually win the Indians over. Many Indians are ashamed of last week's happenings and have expressed sympathy for the two on the reserve. They have been very kind in their dealings with the children, though they have made them understand that they will be firm. God permitted the fight for the greater good of the majority of people living on the Caughnawaga Reserve, though the going is tough for the present.\n\nWith kind personal regards, we beg to remain\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nDecember 3, 1943.\n\nDear Sister Mary George:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, I may say that owing to the scarcity of teachers we are employing married women at the present time. Consequently you may continue the employment of Miss Saylor following her marriage. When this occurs you should let me know her married name, in order that the necessary change may be made in our pay-list.\n\nI am extremely sorry that Mr. Bush has not previously been paid. I took up the matter as soon as your letter was received and was promised that the cheque would go forward to him to-morrow.\n\nThis morning we received a letter from the Agent regarding the furnace at the Kateri School and he is being written.\n\nI am pleased to know that the R.C.M. Police are assisting you in returning the truants to school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nSister Mary George,\nPrincipal,\nR.C., Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6075)\n\nFile 305-1, part 1A\nCaughnawaga - Roman Catholic Day Schools.

We are also enclosing stubs from her other checks. You will notice that some error was made in the bonus. Will you kindly see to this matter?\n\nMiss Saylor was married on December 27th.

Mrs. Bush was paid bonus for October, but subsequently a cheque was issued for Mr. Bush from October 15, 1943, and consequently, according to the ruling in effect at that time, Mrs. Bush had been overpaid bonus for the period October 15 to October 31, 1943, amounting to $7.46.\n\nFrom November 1, 1943, a new regulation went into effect permitting the payment of bonus to both a husband and a wife, although both of them are in Government employ. Consequently in future Mrs. Bush will continue to draw bonus at the rate of $7.46 a month, but, in view of the overpayment of $7.46 for the period October 15 to October 31, this amount was deducted from her December bonus leaving the balance due her $6.14. I enclose her December cheque, also her stubs for October and November.\n\nI note that Miss Saylor was married on December 27 and that her married name is Mrs. Thomas Morris. I enclose new T.D. 1 and cost-of-living bonus forms which she should complete and return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nSister Mary George,\nPrincipal,\nR.C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCaughnawaga, Jan. 19, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nMay I be permitted to be absent from the Caughnawaga R. C.

M. George\nDear Sister Mary George:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, you may be absent from the Caughnawaga R.C. Schools for the period February 3 to 11. It is noted that your work will be taken over by one of the other Sisters during your absence.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nSister Mary George,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga R.C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 15, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois, Indian Agent, Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nWith reference to the attached cost-of-living bonus form submitted by Mrs. Thomas Morris (nee Inez Saylor), I may say that this is the first time we have received a cost-of-living bonus form from her. It is noted that she claims that she supports her father and mother. However, as she dated the form December 27, 1943, it will only be possible to allow her the bonus at the special rate from that date. If she was supporting her father and mother previous to that date, the exact date from which she was supporting them should be shown on the cost-of-living bonus form. I enclose another set of these forms in order that she may complete them again, if she was supporting her parents previous to December 27, 1943.\n\nR.A.

Sister Superior\nCaughnawaga, Que.,\nJune 7, 1944.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq., Supt., of Welfare and Training, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI wish to transmit you herewith requests from Rev. Sister Superior dealing with repairs needed at their residence at the Bush School's also requesting to be allowed to close school on the 22nd of this month.\n\nXX XX XX\n\nI would appreciate being informed if the date suggested for the closing of the Schools meets with your approval also the request for the purchase of lumber for building benches for the use of pupils. Kindly send a supply of forms No. 409.\n\nAt my last visit at Oka the teacher at the Village School, Miss Diabo, inquired as to the closing of her school. She is expecting to close at the same date as the Caughnawaga School. Will the date of closing here apply to Oka also?\n\nFr. Brisebois,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 14, 1944.\n\nMr. F. Brisebois, Indian Agent, Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the closing date of the schools in the Caughnawaga and Oka Agencies. After carefully considering the request it has been decided to approve closing the schools this year only on June 23 and you may so inform all teachers concerned.\n\nEach year the Department issues a circular showing the opening and closing dates of Indian schools. We endeavour to allow reasonable holidays and, as we operate entirely separate from any provincial schools, we are not immediately concerned with the opening and closing dates of white schools. As stated above, we have decided to allow the schools to close on June 23 this year, but it should be distinctly understood by all teachers that no such concession will be allowed in future years, but we will expect the instructions contained in our yearly circular regarding opening and closing dates to be followed without question.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to apply for the position as school teacher which is now opened at the Caughnawaga Catholic school.\n\nI received my diploma in 1931 under the teachings of the Sisters of St. Ann.\n\nI have five years experience as teacher at the Caughnawaga school, 1 year under the supervision of Sister Mary Francis and four years under Sister Mary Cleophas.\n\nI am thirty years old and taught under my maiden name Violet Snow. My husband has signed with the armed forces and expects to be called very soon.\n\nI remain sincerely,\n\nMrs. Harold Dehale.\nTeachers' Residence,\nCanjimawaga, June 13, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nHerewith enclosed, please find check No. W 062868 drawn in favor of I. Morris, our lay teacher. I am returning this check because undoubtedly there has been some mistake in the finance department. Along with the check, I am enclosing a former stub which will show the error made in compiling the amount due Mrs. Morris.\n\nMrs. Morris has notified me that she will not be able to continue as a teacher on our staff. We are certainly very sorry to lose her.\n\nIn this letter, I am enclosing an application letter written by Mrs. Harold Delisle, the former Violet Snow, who formerly taught in our schools. Miss Snow was a competent teacher and we would be pleased to have her to replace Mrs. Morris if it is agreeable to the Department. May I make a suggestion? Mrs. Delisle could be hired for $70. a teaching month and the difference in Mrs. Morris' salary $5.00 monthly could be given to Miss C. Bush who is now getting $60.\n\nThanking you for these and for all past kindnesses, I remain\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nOttawa.\nMonsieur Laplante,\n\nAviez-vous re\u00e7u une r\u00e9ponse du D\u00e9partement au sujet de la fin des classes?

The letter enclosed is self-explanatory.\n\nWill you also let me know if the request previously forwarded relative to the closing of the Schools on the 22nd or 23rd of this month will be approved.\n\nThe application of Mrs. Harold Delisle-nee Violet Snow is also enclosed.\n\n(Frs.

Brisebois, Indian Agent, Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, I am returning the above-mentioned cheque issued in favour of Mrs. Morris. The Treasury Office explains that they had been overpaying the amount of bonus due her and consequently this cheque includes not only her May salary, but the adjustment or the bonus due her from December 27, 1943, to May 31, 1944. The amount of the cheque is, therefore, correct and it should be given to Mrs. Morris. I understand from your letter that Mrs. Morris will give up duties at the Caughnawaga R.C. School at the end of the current month.\n\nI will advise you later regarding the application from Mrs. Delisle.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJune 17, 1944.\n\nMr. F.

The Department will allow Mrs. Delisle salary at the rate of $60 a month, plus bonus, and Miss Charlotte Bush salary at the same rate; namely, $60 a month, plus bonus.

He also asked that we tell you that there will be need of additional lumber to cover the needs of this class.\n\nMay we also call your attention once again to Mrs. Delisle's salary? If you will recall, we took this matter up with you before the opening of classes.

All are from 12 years of age and over, except one who is 11. The parents are all willing to have them attend this class.

As far as we can ascertain, all these cheques are mailed the same day from here and consequently should reach Caughnawaga at the same time. There is a possibility, however, that the delay in receiving your own cheques is due to the fact that these are registered and there may be some delay. Mrs. Bush's cheque is not registered.\n\nIn order to keep peace in the family, it has been decided to mail Mr. Bush's cheque and Mrs. Bush's cheque in separate envelopes.

Brisebois, Indian Agent, Caughnawaga, Que.\n\nWe have recently been informed that certain white children are attending the Caughnawaga R.C. School. The family names are: Fauvreau, La Guiguere and Joubert.\n\nWe have reviewed the March quarter return and find the following names:\n\n- Rolland - 13 years - Eastern School,\n- Albert - 9\n- Jean P. - 8\n- Denise - 10\n\nPresumably, these children belong to the Fauvreau family, mentioned in the first part of this letter. We were not able to locate on the return the names of any children of La Guiguere and Joubert.\n\nThe Department was surprised to receive this information, as you will recall the correspondence in the latter part of 1939 in connection with this matter. I would refer you to official letter of December 8, 1939, and your reply of December 27. I was under the impression that it was definitely understood by the teachers at Caughnawaga R.C. School and yourself that no white children should be allowed to attend without receiving further instructions from this Branch.\n\nPlease review the matter immediately with the Sister Superior, and you should arrange for the discharge of the Fauvreau children mentioned above, if they are white, and also any other white children who may be attending any of the Catholic schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve and the United Church School. I would appreciate\n\np.t.o.\nan early reply, indicating that these instructions have been carried out and that the Rev. Sisters definitely understand our attitude for the future.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, June 8, 1945.\n\nDear Sister Mary George:\n\nI have your kind invitation to attend the Ceremony at Caughnawaga on the 17th instant.\n\nI regret very much that I will be unable to attend.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

This matter was taken up immediately with the Sister Superior and I may say that there are no children by the names of La Guignere or Joubert nor are there to my knowledge any families by that name at Caughnawaga.\n\nRelative to the names of four children named in your letter, they are the children of Mr. Telesphore Payreau a white farmer who has been living at Caughnawaga for over 15 years. He is a tenant on an Indian farm under Departmental lease No.464.\n\nIn connection with their attendance at the local Schools I may say that when the decision to exclude white children from the Schools was arrived at in 1939 it was understood that the children of white farmers occupying farms under official leases would be permitted to attend as they were not trespassers. It was further understood that no white children whose family were residing in the Village could obtain permission as the Department and the Indians did not want outsiders to remain within the limits of the Village for the entire year but only for the Summer months. The cases of the farmers however were considered to be different as if a farmer is permitted to live here it is only logical that his children be received at the Schools. If you examine the Attendance reports of the years past you will note that the Payreau's children have attended the local School regularly for a good number of years. They have not been discharged from School but will be when you notify me of the change of attitude of the Branch as regards to farmers.\n\nIt is quite apparent that your informer or informers have exaggerated the number of white pupils at the Schools of Caughnawaga.\n\n(Frs.

Our stock is now exhausted and we still have some three months of school for 1945-1946.\n\nWe thank you for your kind attention to these matters.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nSISTERS OF SAINT ANN\n\nPrincipal.\n\nB.B.-The balls and bats would be handy just now.\n\nMr. A. Doucet,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 12, 1946.\n\nDear Sister George:\n\nMr. Doucet has referred to me your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the S. S. C. A. meeting in Montreal. I note that to attend this would involve closing approximately one week sooner than the regular closing date. Such action always brings certain repercussions. If we allow it at your school, we will have to do the same with the other schools on the reserve, and then possibly we will have a similar request from the Sisters at St. Regis. If that is granted, it will mean closing all the other schools in the St. Regis Agency. This may not seem very reasonable to you, but it is what actually happens.\n\nIs it the intention that all the Sisters at Caughnawaga would attend the sessions of the Congress? Is it absolutely essential that they should attend all sessions? Would it not be possible for some to attend one day and some another? In that manner the school could be kept in operation until the recognized closing date. I would appreciate it if you would give this matter further consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend Sister Mary George,\nPrincipal,\nR. C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nResolution No. 2161\n\nProposed by Mike Phillips seconded by Louis Canadian that men teachers be appointed to teach the boys at the local Schools.\n\nThis proposition to apply to both the R.C.Schools and the U.C.School and the boys should be taught by men teachers as soon as the matter school. It is the wish of the Council that no teaching Brothers nor Sisters be appointed in any capacity.\n\nF. Grisebois, Indian Agent\nHoses Diabo, Sr., Chief Councillor.\nCaughnawaga, Quebec,\nJune 19, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe staff and the Graduates\nof the Caughnawaga R. C.

Hoey,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 20, 1946.\n\nMy dear Sister Mary George:\n\nPlease accept my sincere thanks for the invitation extended to me to be present at your Commencement Exercises on Sunday Evening, June 23rd, at 8 P.M. It is unnecessary to state that your courtesy in extending this invitation is very much appreciated.\n\nIt so happens that we have at this date a Special Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons engaged in a review of Indian Affairs. The existence of this Committee imposes upon me additional duties and responsibilities, with the result that I have few moments to spare. It is true I am going down to St. Regis to speak at the Homemakers' Club, but the time at my disposal simply will not enable me to consider a visit to Caughnawaga.\n\nYou will be glad to learn that Colonel Neary was recently appointed to my old position of Superintendent of Welfare and Training. Colonel Neary was also anxious to go, but has an engagement at Toronto for the week-end. Some of these days, when the time will permit me, I intend to go down to Caughnawaga and enjoy a real visit with you and the members of your staff. Please convey to the members of the graduating class my congratulations on their achievement and express to them the hope that the future may have in store for them the best that life can give.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nReverend Sister M.

We have done our best to follow the instructions given in the bulletin, No. 4. We submit them to you for your approval; should you find we have made mistakes in classifying ourselves, especially mistakes in our favor, we shall be pleased with the correction....\n\nNo doubt you are aware that many of the books and articles listed on our requisition have not yet been sent in, for instance pencils, covering paper, etc., etc. May we hope to have these within a short time? Authorization also to buy the cleaning articles for the schools and for our residence has not yet been sent either.\n\nA new program of studies for the English Catholic schools of the Province of Que. is adopted this school year. There will be a Teachers' Convention in Montreal on the 18th and 19th of this month. The agent here, Mr. Brisebois allows us to close our schools for these two days so that the teachers may attend this convention. Does this meet with your approval, Sir?\n\nWith the aim of helping our pupils who wish to continue their education after they have completed eighth or ninth grades in our school, we wish to add Latin and French to our program of studies. May we have the authorization of ordering forty-two of each of these text books from the Montreal Book Room? The Department has already ordered books for our schools from this place.\nWe wish to recommend Rejeanne Giasson for a renewal of her grant at St. Angela's Boarding School; it is One Hundred Dollar grant. This pupil came out first in her class last year. Marilyn Mylow, a pupil who graduated from our ninth grade last June wishes to obtain a One Hundred Dollar grant to begin her classical course at St. Angela's Boarding School, Montreal. Josie Jacobs, a pupil for whom we have recently asked for a One Hundred Dollar grant, asks to have One Hundred and Fifty Dollars instead. Her father is a sickly man and the family is poor. The girl wishes to take a Comptometer course at the same time as her commercial course.\n\nWe thank you, Sir, for the kind interest shown to all our problems. We wish to assure you of a cordial welcome to our classes upon your next visit to Caughnawaga.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSr. Mary Albertus\nPrincipal\nMr F Brisebois  \nIndian Agent  \nCaughnawaga Que\n\nADVISE SISTER ALBESTUS THAT CAUGHNAGA SISTERS MAY ATTEND CONVENTION IN MONTREAL NEXT WEEK -stop- ASCERTAIN EXACT DATES FROM INSPECTOR WESCOTT\n\nPhilip Phelan\n\nCharge Indian Affairs  \nMines and Resources\n\nIndian Affairs.

M.

On corrigera ainsi une situation qui ne saurait durer plus longtemps, car un grand nombre de jeunes Indiens d'\u00e2ge scolaire ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient pas encore des avantages de l'enseignement.\n\nSi l'on veut que l'Indien contribue pleinement \u00e0 la collectivit\u00e9 canadienne, il faut, ainsi que l'a soulign\u00e9 M. Glen, que l'\u00e9ducation commence chez l'enfant.\n\nNotons qu'au programme des institutions scolaires projet\u00e9es pour les Indiens, nos voisins de Caughnawaga ne sont pas oubli\u00e9s. On a l'intention de construire en cet endroit un externat de douze classes, pouvant recevoir 350 enfants.

L'enseignement est un domaine provincial, c'est entendu; mais les Indiens, par leur statut sp\u00e9cial, \u00e9chappant \u00e0 la juridiction des provinces, c'est le devoir de l'autorit\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de leur procurer les moyens de s'instruire comme tous les Canadiens.

Therefore, it is recommended that, if possible, one minor change be made in the first floor plan of the Caughnawaga school. Could the small partition be placed in the corner of the teacher's room (109) and a toilet and wash-stand placed in this room for the use of male teachers. The female teachers have ample facilities on the second floor and it is felt that similar facilities should be provided for the male teachers on the first floor.\n\nDirector.\nAugust 11, 1948.\n\nRev.

I have no knowledge of her teaching ability, but she was one of the best students in the Caughnawaga weaving group and turned out special pieces for exhibition work, as well as the regular commercial weaving.\n\nIt would encourage members of the weaving group if one of their number could secure a position such as that applied for by Miss Kane.\n\nThe letter from Mr. Brisebois, together with application from Miss Kane, are returned herewith.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIn Charge\nHandicraft Section\n\nEncls.\nAtt.

I've also been advised to apply for the job as instructor of said drawing room or class.\n\nIf such application is open to an Indian, I would like to be the first to apply for this position. As you may know, I have a number of years experience. I got my training in the Martine in 1938. Under the provisions of the Indian Government, I've worked for Miss Macdonald for two years, later for the MacKay Bros. craft studio in Montreal for four years, and these past two years have been learning for myself.\n\nSo in all these years, I believe I could qualify for this position. I would appreciate if you would consider my application favorably. Thank you.\n\nMiss Esther Anne.\nSeptember 16, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nRe: Gaughanage R.C.

Their receipt is quite timely, considering that the salaries will not come in before the end of September.\n\nWe are eagerly awaiting your visit.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nP.S.

These new Sisters replace those mentioned as having resigned in your last letter.\n\nMany thanks for calling our attention to Sister Mary Jeanne-du-Crucifix's incomplete application. A duplicate copy of her qualifications is enclosed. She must have inadvertently omitted some item, because summer courses are generally included in our \"vacation\" schedule. This new application will no doubt measure up to the standard of your revised salary schedule.\n\nYou will also find enclosed the Teachers' Monthly Reports, the Manual Training Instructors' Reports (Boys and Girls), and the Principal's voucher required by form #377-503-24-9-47. Miss DesCoteaux has not yet returned her Application Form. I shall forward it to you as soon as it comes in.\n\nI have made these first reports to the best of my knowledge\u2014should there be any omissions or errors, kindly let me know. The Manual Instructors' Reports are open to constructive criticism....\n\nMay I ask you to send us a copy of the prescribed school days and holidays for the Teachers' Monthly Reports? We are still looking forward to your visit.\n\nSr. Mary Mediatrix, S.S.A.  \nPrincipal\n\nEnclosures\nCaughnawaga, Que.,\nOctober 13, 1948.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Dept., of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nThe Reverend Principal of the R.C. School advised on this date that one of her teaching staff have yet received their salaries for the month of September, least, with the exception of Miss Descoteaux of the St. Isidore Road School.\n\nMiss Daly, Principal of the U.C. Indian Day School, also informed that Miss Reesor, the newly appointed teacher for the third class of her School, has not yet received her salary for September.\n\nIt would be appreciated by those concerned if their respective pay could be received soon.\n\n(Frs. Brisebois)\nSupt., Indian Agency.\nSt. Ann's Convent\nCaughnawaga, Quebec\nNovember 4, 1948\n\nCol. Bernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOTTAWA\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour absence well explains the delayed answer to the reports sent to you October 1. Now that the Western section has had the pleasure of receiving your visit we of the East may look forward to the same enjoyment soon.\n\nThe classification notice shows your consideration of Sister Mary Jeanne-du-Crucifix's duplicate copy of her qualifications. Thank you very much. May I nevertheless call your attention to the grading of Sister Mary Anne Rosaleen? In her Application Form, she specified 1) holding a First Class Teachers' Certificate of a permanent nature, Quebec, No. 199, dated 1937; 2) having completed her High School in Victoria, B.C.; 3) her Nurses' Registration Certificate and credits for two years Philosophy Courses at Seattle College, U.S.A. This last item, I believe, is equivalent to a Senior Matriculation or First Year University which is the third requisite entitling her to a Grade III classification.\n\nSince you made this point clear to me during our telephone conversation last August, I presume that some specification must have been overlooked when grading her. May I ask you to rectify the matter? It is not so much the matter of money as the knowledge of where and how we stand. Sister is teaching the boys of Grades VIII and IX -- you can readily understand that the work measures up to the stipulated salary.\n\nUnder separate cover, we received 12 Employee Questionnaires to be filled in by the new members of our teaching staff. Seventeen of these Questionnaires were completed by the entire teaching personnel (old and new).\nat the beginning of the school year and submitted to the Indian Agent September 8. Mr. Brisebois assures me of having forwarded to the Department immediately. As you state that only one copy is necessary from each teacher, I did not think I had to return a new set to you. I trust that this will meet with your approval and that there will be no further delay in receiving the remaining salaries. Fortunately, our credit is good....\n\nOne more question -- may I trouble you for the year's supply of Progress Reports for our 330 pupils?\n\nPlease excuse my repeated references to the June Bulletin... but the Agent is the only one on the Reserve who received it. If you should have any spare copies, we would certainly enjoy having them.\n\nThank you once again, Dear Sir, for your kind attention and be assured of a cordial welcome awaiting you.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nP.S. Miss DesCoteaux of the St. Isidore Road School has requested me to inquire about the increase the Department promised her last August concerning the janitor's work she has to do or have done in school and in her residence. You may communicate with her directly or through the Agency or us.\nNovember 23, 1948.\n\nCaughnawaga R.C. Indian Day School.\n\nDear Sister:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of November 4, which arrived when I was absent from my office. Under separate cover we are sending you the Progress Report Cards required for your students.\n\nWith regard to Sister Mary Anne Rosaleen, we are making the necessary adjustment in her salary. Unfortunately, the error is due to a similarity of her name to that of Sister Mary Roseline.\n\nSister Mary Rosaleen is entitled to classification as a Grade III teacher at a salary of $1,500.00 an academic year. She will receive an adjustment cheque for this past under-payment of salary.\n\nI am sorry to note the large number of unqualified teachers whom you have on your staff, and also the number who lack previous teaching experience. This is a matter which I wish to discuss with you when I visit your school in the near future.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Indian Day School.\n\nI had an opportunity while in Montreal to visit Caughnawaga. I was somewhat disappointed with the construction of the new school. Its progress is not what it should be. This is due probably to the difficulty of obtaining material and skilled labour. However, I believe that our architects should endeavour to visit this building and see what can be done to expedite the construction of it. At the rate that they are going at present, they will have a great deal of difficulty working during the winter as none of the walls of the main building are even partially enclosed.\n\nI had a fairly lengthy talk with the new Principal of the school. I visited Miss Terrance's room and I am satisfied that under supervision she is doing her work here as efficiently as possible. The Principal is aware of the reason of her transfer and is following her fairly closely.\n\nI also visited several other classrooms and was pleased with the spirit and atmosphere in Miss Bush's room. I was not impressed with the arithmetic achieved in the senior boys' room. I think that this is probably one of the weak spots in the Caughnawaga schools.\nI have noticed that most of the teachers are new. I was somewhat disappointed because the various talks given to these teachers on the activity program has been to a great extent wasted time. The Principal herself is not familiar with our recommendation on this line and the seven new Sisters probably never heard about it. I feel that the amount of money that we are putting in education at Caughnawaga entitles us to, I would say, better treatment as far as teachers are concerned.\n\nI visited the Manual Training class and am satisfied with the progress being made. Mr. Viau has quite an influence on his pupils. He has good discipline and seems to be well liked by his pupils. Of course, the accommodation is far from being satisfactory. A number of minor mistakes have been made which could have serious repercussions but I believe that I have been able to rectify these in time. This again is due to our inability to visit these schools more frequently.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nA.J. Doucet,\nSupervisor of Vocational Training.\nLachine, January 31th 1949.\n\nMr. B.F.

In fact, I know the different needs of the different courses, because I taught since the primary grades, the superior grades, even to the secondary ones.\n\nAs references, you may write to Mr. Joseph B\u00e9dard, S.I., in Hull, 361, St-Joseph Blvd., Wrightville, Que., and to Reverend Brother Alexander, actual Principal of Mont-Saint-Louis College, 244 East, Sherbrooke St., Montreal, 18, Que.\n\nThe qualifications I possess are the following:\n- Superior Diploma in Teaching, French & English, from the Board of the Public Instruction in Quebec;\n- A Certificate in French Literature from Laval University of Quebec;\n- A Diploma of the Schola Cantorum of Montreal affiliated to Montreal University;\n- The Baccalaureate of Music from Montreal University;\n- A Certificate of First Aid from the Ambulance St-Jean;\n- A Certificate in Physical Training, Grade B.\n\nIf my application receives your favorable consideration, I shall be pleased to begin my duties, as soon as possible, at any time that suits your convenience.\n\nI am, Gentleman,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\n310, 13th ave., Lachine, Que.\nI do not think that the setup of this school has yet been settled.

Brisebois,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nDear Mr. Brisebois:\n\nI regret that I have had to postpone my planned visit to Caughnawaga but this has been necessary because of instructions received by our Director that senior officials should limit their absences from Ottawa during the present session of Parliament. I would appreciate it if you would pass this information to both Miss Daly and the Sister Superior. I still intend to get away to Caughnawaga but will have to await a possible recess in Parliament before doing so.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nSt. Ann's Convent\nGaughnawaga, Quebec\nApril 22, 1949\n\nCol. Bernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOTTAWA\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Easter holidays mark the last stages of the school year. I trust that they offered you the well-deserved relaxation after a heavy winter session and the opportunity of freshening up for the spring and summer rush\u2014I don't suppose that summer lull exists for you. Since the date of your promised visit is so uncertain, I am taking the liberty of writing you about the various points and situations with which Time has the gift of strewing our path.\n\nFirst, Sister Mary Anne Rosaleen, teacher of Grades IX and VIII Boys, was transferred to our Infirmary in Lachine on April 11 where she will remain till the summer. As no other substitute could be had, Sister Evelina Marie, our Physical Culture instructor, was appointed to replace her. Despite the fact that none of us favor substitution during the school year, I am confident that you will understand that this change is necessitated by inevitable circumstances beyond our control.\n\nThis in turn gives rise to another situation. You are fully aware that it is not feasible to exact Sister Evelina Marie to fulfill both duties; but as there are only a few weeks left, the respective class teachers would be willing to continue the drills with their individual classes if you allowed extra compensation for this extra work. From the very beginning, Sister promised the pupils a public demonstration as an incentive to their best effort. Not to disappoint them, the Sisters would be willing to lend a helping hand.\nYet I do not think it would be fair to tax the teachers with this extra task without some suitable remuneration. Should you decide otherwise, we shall simply abide by your decision and drop the physical training. I am sorry for the disturbance this change will cause in the Department of Finance; but as I stated above, this condition could not be avoided nor controlled.\n\nThe third point concerns the moving to the new school which is progressing quite well. If I remember well, you mentioned last November that this would take place before the pupils left for their holidays as it would be too onerous to do it alone. Now, would you want us to transfer only the school supplies? Do you intend furnishing the new school with entirely new equipment or shall we prepare the old for transportation too?\n\nThese and many other minor question marks would be quickly discussed and settled \"viva voce\"--shall we have the pleasure of receiving you soon?\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. We have written to the Ontario Department of Education in Toronto for details concerning the summer courses they offer for teachers. If at all manageable, some of us will no doubt attend.\nApril 29, 1949.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Mediatrix,\nPrincipal,\nR.C. Indian Day School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nCaughnawaga R.C. Indian Day School.\n\nI have for answer your letter of April 22 concerning Sister Mary Anne Rosaleen. I was sorry to hear of her illness and wish to advise that she will receive salary payment up to April 30.\n\nThe salary schedule of the Department does not provide added remuneration for extra-curricular activities. Our day school teachers coach hockey teams, run dramatic and debating societies, supervise homemakers' clubs and many other functions, on the salary provided in our schedule.\n\nNow that the session of Parliament may end in the near future, I have great hopes of finally being able to visit Caughnawaga again.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Brisebois.\nApril 29, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nRe: Caughnawaga R.C., Indian Day School, No. 305.\n\nMR - IAE - 305 - 3011.\n\nSister Mary Ann Rosaleen has been obliged to resign at the above school, due to illness, effective May 1, 1949.

I wish on behalf of these people, to protest the actions of the present Council, by passing Resolutions and By-laws without discussion and without the consent of the individual Councillor.

The finishing touches are lingering and the opening date of the school term is just one month ahead.\n\nWe are not exactly worrying about it, but we must admit that we are really anxious about the moving, the necessary new equipment, and the numerous details of installation. The weekly promise of Mr. Bock's \"taking possession\" keeps us in hopes...and no doubt that the \"real\" day is just around the corner.\n\nIn the meantime, our yearly appointments took place\u2014only two changes on our teaching staff: Sr. Mary Cabrini and Sr. Mary Bernard of Siena.

The teaching staff for the school year 1949-50 is as follows:\n\nSr. Marie Sr. M. Bernard of Siena\nSr. M. Jeanne-du-Crucifix Sr. M. George Ernest\nSr. Evelina Marie Sr. M. Alma (Dom. Science)\nSr. Mary Roseline Miss Charlotte Bush\nSr. Mary Louis Richard Mrs. Wilfrid Rice (Dom. Science)\nSr. Mary Cabrini Sr. M. Mediatrix, Principal\n\nYou are no doubt waiting for this information before sending us the Qualifications blanks necessary for proper classification and salary notification.\n\nLast June when we spoke of the Official Opening of the school, you promised to send us a definite program. Would it be too early to ask for this program now...we\nwould like to have the music and address ready for rehearsal when school opens. You will agree that from now till then Time is making itself rather short. So any preparation that we can see to during the holidays will only save a last-minute rush.\n\nWould you approve our taking a few former pupils to help us execute our Official Opening program? Besides appreciating the great honor, they would be really lending us \"main forte.\"\n\nWe sincerely trust that your visit to Gaughnawaga will not delay so that we may discuss the several important minor details concerning the coming school year.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nEnc. 2\n\nP.S.

Mr Plante holds a diploma issued by the Mohawk Institute, which is recognized by the Department as entitling the holder to teach an Indian school.\n\nMr Brown M.P. personally recommended the above applicant, and the only question as to his suitability to manage such a large school, is his youth and inexperience. If however, it is decided to engage him, his appointment might be made temporarily.\n\nFour hundred and fifty dollars ($450) is provided for the salary of the teacher of this school. The undersigned would suggest that the new teacher be appointed at the rate of $300 per annum, with an increase of $1:50 per quarter for every unit of average attendance over 25, until the full salary provided is reached. There are about 200 pupils who should attend this school, but from carelessness on the part of the late teacher and apathy of the parents the average attendance has gradually fallen to 16 for the past year.\n\nThis is one of the schools where the Regulations for compulsory attendance should be enforced, and it would be well to do so at once that the new teacher may have a fair start.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Welch, on the twenty-sixth day of July, in the year 1897, wish to forward my application for the position as teacher, for the Indian School, in the reserve of Caughnawaga, which position was vacated by the late dismissed of Frank E. Jacobs, Esq.\n\nIt is through the confidence of your promise, enclosed herewith, and of a promise of endorsement of our Member, Mr. James P. Brown, and also of the weight of the testimonial which I promptly submit to your inspection, as to my character and qualifications, that I venture to apply to the Department of Indian Affairs for the vacancy.\nAll the councillors of this reserve, and in union with the great majority of the Tribe, cordially did desire my entrance to the position, as the accompanying petition, superscribed will signify, and of which, I now, humbly, the department, to entertain favorable consideration.\n\nWishing to offer my heartfelt thanks to the department, for its kind attention,\n\nI have the honor to be sir,\nYour obedient servant\n\nP.S. Selisle\nOttawa, 2nd April, 1897.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to the conversation which you had with me, and the communication which you handed me from the missionary at Caughnawaga, the Chief Councillor and others, recommending you for employment in the Department of Indian Affairs, I regret to say that at present there is no position which could be offered you. Instead of adding to the staff I have found it necessary to cut it down considerably. I should be very glad to be able to avail myself of your services in the Department, but it would not be fair for me to hold out the hope of my being able to give you an appointment, for from the present outlook it will be some time before I will have occasion to make any addition to the staff of the Department of Indian Affairs. I shall, however, bear your name in mind, and in the event of an opportunity offering of meeting your wishes you shall not be overlooked.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPeter Delisle, Esq.\nCaughnawaga, P.O.\nCaughnawaga July 26th\n\nHonorable Clifford Sifton\nSup. Gen. of Ind. Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Peter L. Smith of Caughnawaga is applying for the situation of teacher at Caughnawaga School.\n\nAs he has not yet any diploma as teacher I cannot judge him as a teacher; but what I know of him and I am happy to certify is that he performed an excellent commercial course at St. Laurent College, as stated in the certificate of Father McGarry, which he presents with this note\u2014and since two years he is out of the College his conduct has been that of a very good and reliable young man.\n\nJ.

This certificate is recognised by the Department.\n\nAnother application is from Mr. Peter Delisle, of Caughnawaga, who holds a diploma from St. Laurent College (business department). Mr. Delisle is recommended by the Roman Catholic missionary on the Reserve, by the President of the College he attended, and by a number of the Councillors and members of the Caughnawaga Band.\n\nMr. Brown, the local Member, is referred to by both applicants, and he has been asked to state whether he wishes the appointment of Mr. Plante to be made, as he called at the Department on his behalf some time ago; but he has not signified his wishes in the matter.\n\nIt is desirable that the school should be reopened at once, and that a teacher should be appointed.\n\nMr. Delisle encloses with his application a letter received from the Minister in reply to an application for employment in the Department, in which the Minister states that he will bear his name in mind, and in the event of an opportunity offering of meeting his wishes he will not be overlooked.\n\nAug. 18th, '97.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have at present our full quota of clerks, and I do not know of any position which Mr. Plante could be recommended for.\n\nI may say that the temporary clerks under the Civil Service Act are paid at the rate of $400 a year, which may be increased $20 a year to a maximum of $600. Mr. Plante, however, receives $450 salary as teacher at Caughnawaga, and residence, which I think is as good as, if not better than, the Civil Service offers.\n\nI return the certificate, as you may desire to make other use of it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. L.F.

The enrollment is at present forty-four with an average attendance of about twenty-one. This, I consider is very unsatisfactory.\n\nMr Omer Plante, the teacher, who is an Indian, receives a salary of $450 a year and should, I think do something to bring up the school to a better standard. He has been in charge for nearly three years, and so far as I can judge from the reports on file, no advance is apparent.\nOTTAWA, 20th April, 1900\n\nSir,\n\nYour reports on the Boys' school at Caughnawaga show that the attendance is very unsatisfactory and I am directed to ask you for explanations regarding the falling off in interest indicated. Mr. Omar Plante who has had charge of this school for about four years, and who receives the highest salary paid the teacher of any Indian school has made no apparent advance in that time, the average attendance being now only about 21 out of about 200 pupils that should attend.\n\nThe Department considers that much better results should have been obtained from this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nA.

That is why I recommend and still recommend that Mr. Owen Plante be placed in another position so that another teacher may occupy the position appointed who will be in a better position to enforce attendance, while to carry out the law at the present time would, in my opinion, cause a revolt among the Indians.\n\nSincerely,\n\nF.

It appears to me that the school is suffering in order that Mr Plante may be provided for, and I think it would be better, if possible to let him have charge of another school and secure a new teacher for Caughnawaga. There will be a vacancy at Cornwall Island, although the salary attached to the position is lower than that paid at Caughnawaga.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Forbes, Missionary, and Mr. Lessard, Vicar. The attendance was not large and the pupils for the most part did not reply well to the questions; the reasons are known by the Department, and it is to be hoped that during the holidays Mr. Plante will have the benefit of receiving a position from the Department which he can fill with satisfaction, and that another teacher will be selected to the great advantage of the children of the Band, because it is not possible to attribute the lack of attendance to the teacher.\n\nI have, &c.,\nA. Brosseau,\nAgent.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA 10th August, 1900.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nI beg to call your attention to my memorandum of the 5th May last in reference to the teacher of the Boys' School on the Caughnawaga Reserve, which was submitted to the Deputy Minister who directed that the matter stand for the present.\n\nIn this connection I would also refer you to a letter from Mr Agent Brosseau herewith, in which it is stated that it is hoped that during the holidays Mr Plant will have the benefit of receiving a position from the Department which he can fill with satisfaction, and that another teacher will be selected to the great advantage of the children of the Band.\n\nAs this school should shortly re-open I should like to know whether any further action is to be taken.\n\nMartin Brosseau\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. McLean,\n\nIn view of all the circumstances I do not think that Mr. Plant should be employed at this school again but that another teacher should be secured who will have the full confidence of the people. I do not think that the interests of the school ought to be interfered with. If it is possible to get another position for Mr. Plant later on I see no reason why the Department should not endeavor to do so but this cannot be made any condition of the new teacher being supplied to the Caughnawaga Reserve.\n\nDeputy Supt-General.\nOTTAWA, 15th August, 1900.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your letter of the 3rd ultimo respecting the Caughnawaga Boys' school I am directed to inform you in reply that the Department has decided that Mr Plante is not to be employed again as teacher of this school.\n\nYou will be advised later on as to the appointment of a new teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

All applications, accompanied by certificates and testimonials are to be submitted to the Department and all applicants are required to have a teaching knowledge of English.\n\nThe salary on appointment will be at the rate of $350.00 a year which may be increased up to $450.00 should the results obtained justify it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The average attendance is about 45 who are in the first four standards and most of the teacher's time is devoted to the younger pupils who form the greatest number. It seems to me that an assistant is required at this school, forty pupils being about the limit allowed to one teacher in the public schools where they are all of one grade. Good results cannot be obtained in a school of this class where the pupils are in four different standards.\n\nThe attendance under Mr Delisle, the present teacher, has more than doubled, and I think that still better results could be obtained if he had more time to devote to the older pupils. The quarterly returns show that the ages of the pupils run from six to sixteen.\n\nThe Girls school on this reserve, which has about the same average attendance though a smaller enrollment, has two teachers and is doing good work.\n\nThere\nThere are three schools on this reserve, two Roman Catholic (Boys and Girls) with a school population of about 200 each and an attendance as above stated, and one Methodist school with an enrollment of 6 and an average attendance of 3 pupils. The appropriation for these schools is $450.00 for the Boys (the amount paid being $400.00); $500 for the Girls ($300.00 for the senior teacher and $200.00 for the junior); $250.00 for the Methodist, ($125.00 being paid by the Department through the Methodist Missionary Society) which leaves $175.00 for the appropriation voted for salaries unspent, which might be used in paying the salary of a second teacher for the Boys School and I think that if a small amount were added by the Department there would be no difficulty in getting a teacher to take charge of the junior class.\n\nThe present building used by the Boys has ample accommodation for two classes, there being two rooms of 25 x 22 ft each.\nOttawa, 17th December, 1901.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the Caughnawaga Boys' School for the month of November last and in reply to inform you that the Department is gratified to note the increased attendance at this school, and if the large number of pupils shown on the roll is kept up or increases till July steps will be taken to provide an additional teacher.\n\nIn the meantime the Department would like to have a report from you as to what accommodation can be provided in the present building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nA.

It will secure a better attendance and greater success with the pupils. As to the choice of the head teacher, Mr. Delisle, I am happy to state that he is perfectly competent, very active, and has the privilege of understanding the character and peculiar wants of his pupils. I have been very much pleased with his methods and ways of doing. Now it seems to me that the assistant who is recommended by him, and also by Rev Father Forbes, Mr. Peter Williams, is perfectly qualified for acting as an assistant, and so, I beg to give a favorable opinion about his appointment.\nIf an assistant who does not know the Indian language were appointed there, he would be of little use, as nearly all the beginners are ignorant of the English language. With Mr. Williams as an assistant, Mr. Deleste, who possesses a very good education indeed in English, Mathematics, Geography, etc., will be able to give all his time to the advanced pupils, and Mr. Williams, according to his certificates, will be able to take care of the beginners under his general direction.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Schools,\n193, Maisonneuve St.,\nMontreal.\nJanuary 17th, 1903\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nTo J.D.

I have reasons to believe that Mr. Peter Williams is well qualified for the position.

Dolisie, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nTo Secretary Indian Affairs, Ottawa,\n\nSir:\u2014My present remuneration of $300 per annum, as assistant teacher of the Canaghawaga Boys' School being insufficient to meet the increased cost of living and other necessities, in consequence of which fact, I am urged for the second time to pray the department to kindly consider my petition for an augmentation of salary. I entertain the most implicit confidence that the department will not deny the justice of my humble request, and I have every hope that I shall not have prayed in vain.\n\nAwaiting your esteemed reply, I beg the honor to remain your obedient servant,\n\nPeter Williams\nOttawa, September 26, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nMr. Peter Williams, assistant teacher of the Caughnawaga Boys' school has applied for an increase in salary. He is at present in receipt of $300 per annum and has been in the employ of the Department since January, 1903 at his present salary. He claims that this salary, owing to the increased cost of living, is not sufficient for the maintenance of himself and family. This application is renewing a former one made two years ago, when he was told that the Department did not see its way to pay him more than he was then receiving.\n\nHe is an educated Indian and has given satisfaction as far as his work goes and he has the largest class in the school and is not provided with anything further than his salary. The head teacher receives $450 and house and heating. Caughnawaga is an expensive place to live in, and nearly all the young Indians of Williams' age are earning double his wages, and Williams could easily do better if he were to leave the reserve. It would be a difficult matter to replace him, as no white man would take the position for the salary offered. He has had nearly four years' experience, has the confidence of the parents and Mr. School Inspector Zippens speaks favourably of him in his reports.\n\nI know there is no provision for a higher salary at present, but I think the time has arrived when the Department will have to face the question of increasing the salaries of some of the teachers if they wish to retain their services. Frequent changes are not conducive to the welfare of a school, and I would suggest that, if funds can be spared, Mr. Williams be granted an increase of about $100.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Therefore, I must not be wanting in the virtue of perseverance in my appeal to your generosity for an increase in my yearly dole; this is not only a matter of necessity, but, I feel it a burden duty to my family as well, for whose consideration I am forced to commit myself to your liberal and conscientious judgment.\n\nI remain\n\nYour humble and obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Delisle was appointed in Sept. 1900 at a salary of $400 per annum, which was increased in 1902 to $450, at which rate he is now paid.\n\nMr. Delisle, who is a member of the Caughnawaga band, sets forth his claims to recognition by the Department in a letter hereunder, dated the 9th inst., and I think an Indian who can express himself in such classic English is entitled to consideration. He has had charge of this school for nearly eight years, during which time Mr. Inspector Lippens shows that creditable work has been done by Mr. Delisle and his assistant, Mr. Williams, and I think if the Department would provide $500 a year for him, it would be only a fair recognition for his past services and would be no more proportionately than the $450 he was allowed in 1902.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

His work has been satisfactory, and I think he is entitled to consideration. Mr. School Inspector Lippens speaks favourably of his work in his report. Unless he is paid at the rate of $400 he will be obliged to resign and it would be a pity to lose him, as he is well thought of by the Indians and it would be a difficult matter to replace him.

He has a large school and the average attendance for the last quarter was 106, as shown by the return. He is reported to be doing good work in the school and has been in charge for the last twelve years. While Mr. Delisle has no professional qualifications, he has had a great deal of experience and is conversant with Iroquois, French and English and is popular with the tribe.\n\nMr. Delisle is correct in his statement that ever since the school has been conducted a residence has been provided for the teacher, as the old building in which the\nthe school was held afforded ample room for teacher's quarters. The building of the new school necessitated his abandoning these quarters, which are used for other purposes, and Mr. Delisle has been obliged to find living accommodation elsewhere and I think he is quite justified in claiming compensation. I think that $100.00 a year would be a fair amount to allow him for the loss that he has sustained in having to provide a house for himself.\n\nMr. Delisle would be entitled to the $60.00 grant we are allowing other Indians to continue the education of deserving pupils.\n\nI think that it would be better to make Mr. Delisle a $100.00 rent allowance than to increase his salary and he would have no complaint if this were done.\nThe Accounts and Schools Branches,-\n\nMr. Delisle, teacher of the Caughnawaga Boys' school, called on me this morning and left with me the inclosed letter. He states that he has 106 pupils and asks for an increase in salary. Will you kindly look into the matter and let me have a report as to what can be done.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOctober 413524\n\nTo the Deputy Superintendent General, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nCircumstances necessitate that I should again essay to obtain, in some manner, an augmentation to the remuneration allowed me as Principal of the Laughnawaga Boys' School.\n\nTwice have I been denied, and notwithstanding some, I still have left in me some of the patience and perseverance so essential to the teacher's vocation, to encourage me to make another appeal to your considerate judgment for some pecuniary assistance in my endeavor to unite both ends meet.\n\nThe undiminished fact that teachers are underpaid, and that the scale of salaries in vogue is based upon the living condition of a decade or more ago, the same being now so inconsistent with the present increased cost of living, are the main reasons that I make this humble request.\n\nI have been teacher in the same position for twelve years, starting at four hundred.\nhundred, and I am now receiving five hundred dollars, $41352.4 which shall prove to be the limit that can be obtained; nevertheless, I cannot forget the old adage, \"As you sow, so shall you reap.\" I have sacrificed the better part of my life to satisfy the hopes of my people, young generation\u2014a mission performed without regret.\n\nDuring the period that I have been the chief, I have had the free use of a house in connection with the school, (being so with teachers for the past twenty years) it being considered part of the salary, but since the completion of the boys' new school I have had to vacate same and some fellows to pay rent for other quarters.

On July 1st, 1906, he was granted an increase of $50.00 and on April 1st, 1908, a further increase of $50.00, making his salary now $400.00 per annum. In view of the fact that Mr. Delisle, teacher of the senior room, was recently granted $100.00 per annum in lieu of rent, making his salary $600.00 per annum, I think that Mr. Williams, who is a conscientious worker, should receive an increase of not less than $50.00 per annum and would recommend that he be given a salary of $450.00 from the first of the current quarter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I beg to say that while on the reserve Dr. Patton, Chief Councilor and some other members of the Band brought this matter to my notice. When visiting the schools, I asked the teachers and truant officer for an explanation for the small attendance, on the days I called at the schools I was informed that it was owing to the children being prepared for their first communion and confirmation by the Missionaries. When I called on Father Granger I found him and his assistant engaged in instructing 65 school children in the Church, in their religious duties, and he explained to me that it was necessary to take them out of the schools for the purpose, as the religious teaching had to be given in Iroquois as they were not sufficiently familiar with English to thoroughly understand religious teaching in that language. Father Granger told me that while the teachers of the Boys' and Bush Schools were Indians he did not\nnot consider them competent to give the necessary instruction.\n\nI am creditly informed that in all the Roman Catholic Schools throughout the Province of Quebec and even in the separate schools of Ontario it is the practice for the priests and missionaries to take charge of the religious teaching necessary to fit children for their first communion and confirmation, during school hours and for the greater portion of the school day even in cities and towns, while in rural districts the whole time is devoted to this work.\n\nFrom what I have heard and know, of some of the Caughnawaga Indians and of Dr. Patton in particular, I am led to believe that this complaint is made more in pique, than for the interest of the school children. It is the desire of the Missionaries at Caughnawaga to make the Indians under their care good Catholics and I do not consider that it would be politic to hamper them in their efforts to do so.\nOttawa, May 14, 1913.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of a resolution of the Caughnawaga Indian Council protesting against the children of the Boys' school attending Church for religious instruction during school hours, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is credibly informed that it is the practice in all the Roman Catholic Schools in the Province of Quebec to allow priests and missionaries to take charge of the religious teaching necessary to fit children for their first communion and confirmation during school hours. The Department does not therefore consider that it would be politic to hinder the missionaries in inserting religious instruction to the children who are preparing for their first communion or confirmation, and you will be good enough to so inform the Councilors.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

In the case of Paul Delorme vs Mrs Jos Delorme, which has been dragging for some years & has created considerable ill-feeling among the relatives of Delorme. Mr. Delisle has been acting in behalf of Mrs. Jos Delorme with pay, to acquire the rights of Paul Delorme.

If it is the intention of the Department to place the schools in the village in other hands after the summer holidays I think it would be well to give Mr. Delisle notice before the end of the current quarter that his services will be no longer required.

There are Indians on the reserve who would be glad of an opportunity to take temporary employment and who would be quite competent to impart some instruction and keep the children off the streets and out of mischief.

D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. M. Brosseau, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nThe fourth class opened in the Baye School Sept. 7th has been recognized by the Department in a letter to me from the Deputy Sept. General, Hon. Duncan Scott Nov. 17th. As I have paid the teacher of this class three months' salary Sept., Oct., and Nov. from our own funds I would request as a favor that the Department refund the money as soon as possible for Sam\nmuch in need of it.\n\nThanking you, esteemed Sir,\n\nfor your kindness in doing so.\n\nI remain\n\nYours most respectfully,\n\nS. M. Edward, Principal\nOttawa, December 20, 1915.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, in which you request that the salary of the fourth teacher in the Caughnawaga Boys School be paid you from the date of this teacher's appointment.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that a cheque for $120.00, being the salary due for the months of September, October, November and December, 1915, is being sent you.\n\nAs soon as the quarterly return of attendance for the current quarter is received, the salaries due for the other teachers will be sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nFor Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nRev. Sister Mary Edward,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga Boys School\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nOttawa, March 3rd, 1917.\n\nI beg to report that in pursuance with your instructions I called upon Mr. and Mrs. Joe Canadien in reference to their complaint against the sisters of the Caughnawaga Boys' School for alleged discrimination against their boys and for ill-treatment as well.\n\nThey stated that their boys, Charlie and Angus, were objects of personal spite by the sisters; the oldest boy was picked on as a scapegoat for some lies circulated casting reflection on the conduct of the sisters, while the youngest one was given severe corporal punishment which resulted in injury to his ear necessitating his being attended to by the doctor; the boys were expelled from the school and would not be allowed to return unless they apologized to the sisters and the missionary.\n\nI called upon the truant officer, Martin Twoaxe, for his version of the matter and he corroborated almost all the statements made by the Canadiens*. He ventured to state that he thought the sisters were unduly severe with these two boys, and should show a little more patience in their treatment with the Indian children. I also called upon Dr. Jacobs, who attended the boy for his ear, and he informed me that the ear trouble was a long standing and chronic one, nothing whatever to do with the punishment given the boy by the teacher at school.\n\nI called on the Sister Superior and the Sister who had the supervision of the boys' school and they both emphatically denied the charges made by Mr. and Mrs. Canadien, and pronounced same as fabrication of falsehoods.\n\n*Indian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6076, file 305-1B, part 1)\nThey stated that the boys were exceptionally unruly and insubordinate for which they were punished mildly, telling the youngest one that \"if he did not behave himself better than he has been he would have to seek another school\".\n\nThe Sisters assured me that the boys were welcome to return to school at any time, but must obey the teachers.\n\nI advised Mr. and Mrs. Canadien to send the youngest one back to school at once, and asked them to join him to behave himself in school and obey his teachers. They promised to comply with my request and I am in hopes that there will be no further cause of complaint from that source. With regard to the oldest one, Charlie, I did not urge them to send him back to school as he is practically fifteen years old and rather big for his age.\n\nI should like to state that it is evident there exists an ill-feeling between the sisters and the Indians. The Indians generally are not backward in expressing their dislike of the sisters, while the latter, from my conversation had with them, they made use freely certain phraseology which showed their feelings towards these people which lacked the tone of sympathy. It would therefore be no matter of surprise if there were disagreements of this sort reported to the Department from time to time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCaughnawaga, March 1, 1917.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to write you concerning Angus Canadian, son of Mr. Joseph Canadian of Caughnawaga.\n\nThis family has been doing us more harm with their tongues than all the villagers put together.\n\nIf the parents did not take care of the child, we would not have any trouble, but when a man says: \"I do not want you to touch my boy, or I'll fix you\" just as if we spend our time ill-treating them. He even named children in the classroom to spy the teacher.\n\nIt takes the patience of a saint to endure him, and when a teacher has 30 or more pupils to supervise she has no time to spend coaxing or petting Angus Canadian.\n\nIn school they have to toe the mark if they wish to learn. He has been stubborn, disobedient, impudent and lazy.\n\nI was told he blames us if he has sore ears. We know he is deaf, but, if Almighty God gave him that infirmity it is not our fault, moreover he has the first seat near the teacher's desk, and if he wants to listen he has every opportunity.\n\nIn December he was behaving badly and disturbing the whole class, so Sister said: \"Angus Canadian if you are not able to keep up to your promise I am afraid you will have to look for another school.\" There is a vast difference in that saying, and in telling a pupil: \"Not to come back after Christmas.\" That is what he has been saying through the village.\n\nWe did not put him out, we never put any child out, but, Mr Benson, I warned the boy before the Truant Officer.\nif he did not be polite and obedient that I would not have anything to do with him or his parents, but I WOULD REFER his case to the Department itself in the name of Mr Benson who has charge of the schools. It is a decided affair that we are not going to let ourselves be led by children.\n\nI KNOW you understand our position and that you will continue helping us for the good of those Indians.\n\nI shall inform you occasionally of his conduct and I HOPE YOU WILL pardon me if I took up so much of your time reading this long epistle.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr Martin Benson,\nSuperintendent of Stationary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, 19 Jan. 1920\n\nMr. A. Lill & Cunningham phones the Office about 15 to 1 P.M. today he asks Station to hire a Constable to arrest Father Ross holding a Dance Hall Show last night in the Girls School House. I told him that I did not know enough about the facts to warrant giving certain persons a chance; that Mr. Lill would have to assume responsibility for any action taken by him to arrest a Constable other than the Station (so called) stationed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

When I told you about two years ago that these were bought with my own salary, you very kindly said I was to have an additional grant of ten dollars for the June prizes. I did receive this grant last year, but our Agent has informed me that the Department is not disposed to give it this year. May I ask you to be\nkind enough to see that we receive this amount in June. Some of the teachers here buy the gifts at Christmas and divide them, leaving one half for the examination at the end of the year. But this is impossible for me, as I have, in all, more than three times their number of pupils.\n\nTrusting you will grant my favor, thanking you now.\n\nI am\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nMary E.

Mr. Forbes, Missionary, and Mr. Lessard, Vicar. The progress of the pupils of Miss Gibbons' class leaves much to be desired; she complains that the pupils were frightened by our presence, but it is always the same, they reply very badly to the questions put and the attendance of this class was very poor (there were only seven pupils) compared with the class of Mr. Beaupre, who had a large number of pupils who were well disciplined. The progress of this latter class is satisfactory and I am of opinion that a change of teacher for the first class would agree with the idea of the Indians in regard to the education of their children, as they always like a change, and in this case would be desirable.\n\nI have, &c.,\nA. Brosseau,\nAgent.\nOTTAWA, 9th April, 1901.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the Caughnawaga Girls school for the month of March last; and in reply I beg to say that the Department would be glad if you would examine into and report upon the causes which lead to the unsatisfactory attendance at this school, stating particularly whether you consider it the fault of the teachers or the parents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nA.

The teacher is certainly to blame to some extent.\n\nI have, &c.,\nA.

Out of two hundred who should attend there are only sixty-seven on the roll, with an average attendance of twenty-eight for last month.

Further the school in its present state accommodates only forty-two. I also wish to say that I shall not return the position of Teacher here longer than the close of the present term. I trust the Department will notice the fact that I have been obliged to do all the work in connection with the heating of the schoolroom during the past six years which was not my work.

The trouble is said to be causing a good deal of excitement, and threatens to be serious.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 22nd April, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMiss Street, who is in charge of the Caughnawaga Girls school, applies on behalf of herself and her assistant, Mrs Beauvais, for an increase of salary of $100.00 each. Miss Street's present salary is $300.00 and Mrs Beauvais receives $200.00 per annum.\n\nThis school is doing well under its present teachers and they think they are entitled to an increase on account of the cost of living. Miss Street called at the office during the Easter vacation and drew attention to the difference between the salaries paid the teachers of the Girls school and the Boys school at this place. The head teacher of the latter school receives $450.00 a year and his assistant $300.00, while the average attendance at each school is about the same, being about 40 pupils.\n\nMr Inspector Lippens reports favorably of the work done by Miss Street and her assistant and Mr Ross of this Department, who was lately in Caughnawaga, tells me that he was much pleased with what he saw at the Girls school.\n\nThe salaries are certainly low and I think that if $50.00 a year could be added to each, it would be an encouragement to them and only a fair recognition of their services.\n\nThere are a great many children of school age on the Caughnawaga reserve and under the present\nmanagement there has been a marked improvement in the attendance.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

While quite prepared to do my duty and fulfill the orders of the Department, I wish to protest against being made a collector of money, which seems tome outside a Teacher's province. This matter is extremely delicate.\n\nIt appears tome to be a Teacher's duty to promote peace and concord among her pupils, instead of exciting race feeling by making distinctions.\n\nSince I have been here it has been my endeavour to promote peace and allay\nit feeling in every way in my power. The question of the Indians receiving money from the children is also a very delicate one for her, and I cannot see any way of getting myself in that awkward position.\n\nI found it difficult to make a list of French children, as I do not know the genealogy of each family, nor is it my business, nor have I time and inclination to inquire. I sent the names of six children who, I was told, were French. I now find out that four of these are Indians in the eyes of the Department. Would it not be better if the Mayor, one of the Commissioners, or the Constable should collect this money from the parents? I cannot undertake to receive it.\n\nHoping this matter may be arranged to the satisfaction of everybody,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nM. E.

Burke,\nTeacher,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nOttawa, December 1, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that Miss Burke, teacher of the Caughnawaga Girls' School, has been authorized to expend a sum not exceeding $10.00 in the purchase of prizes to be distributed at the end of the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL.

I may state that it is considered that a little enterprise on the part of the teachers and Indians of the village might result in their being able to raise funds themselves for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau Esq.,\nAssistant Indian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nSt. Constant, 23 March, 1912\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to ask you if the Councillors of Caughnawaga or any other Indians of the Reserve, have the right or the permit from your Department to visit the different schools of the Reserve during the school hours, and to investigate upon matters in regard to discipline etc., these visits from Dr Patton and other councillors become intolerable and it is desirable that your Department regulate them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAsst-Indian Agent,\nSir,-\n\nIn reply to the inquiry contained in your letter of the 23rd instant I beg to say that, while the Department does not object to Councillors of a band or other Indians making occasional visits to the schools on their reserves, it will not permit them to interfere in any way with the management of the school. If they have anything to find fault with they should make their complaint in writing to you for transmission to the Department and you will be good enough to inform the Indians accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. Letourneau, Esq.,\nAsst. Indian Agent,\nSt. Constant, Que.\nOttawa, April 23, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 22nd instant I beg to say that the cheques for both the teachers at the Caughnawaga Girls' School were forwarded on April 16th addressed to Caughnawaga. No doubt they received them in due course.\n\nWith regard to the request that permission be granted to dismiss the junior class at 3.30 p.m. instead of 4, I beg to say that this is approved so far as the children in Part 1 of the First Book are concerned, but it is considered that the rest of these in the junior room should remain during the whole of the school period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL.

There was attendance of eighty seven.\n\nI must inform the Dept. that my sister Miss Sadie could not come with me for a few days, owing to mother being ill. I took a young girl who received a Model School diploma last month who had not been engaged as teacher in any school.\nShe succeeds very well so far.\nI trust the Department will not object to this, as there is question of a few days only, perhaps two weeks.\nIt was impossible to present her to any one of the men at the Department before leaving.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nMary E.

Burke, teacher of the Caughnawaga Girls' School, requesting your Department to contribute towards the purchase of a piano for the use of the Girls' School.\n\nIf I am permitted to express my opinion on this subject I would have to say that amongst the efforts made by your Department in order to promote the Education of the Indians, specially those of the Caughnawaga Reserve, I believe that if music lessons could be given to the girls at their school, this would certainly encourage the parents, - specially the Iroquois who are fond of music, - to persist towards the attendance of their children at the Caughnawaga School only; I have reasons to believe that their request will be favourably considered by your Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nActing Indian Agent,\nSir,\n\nMay I hope that the Department will kindly contribute towards the purchase of a piano for the Girls School here.\n\nThe children are talented in calisthenics, drill etc., and have given some very creditable entertainments, the profits of which are given towards the work of the hospital or to help in the repairs of the church.\n\nIt is impossible, however, to continue these exercises without the use of a piano.\n\nIf the Department would grant us a generous contribution, we could, I think, procure one.\n\nI think it advisable that the Indians remain ignorant of the fact that any of the profits obtained from the children's entertainments are given towards the purchasing of a piano, so they may trouble us for the loan of it very frequently.\nThey may be told, if necessary, that some friends have also contributed towards this purchase.\n\nThe Superintendent of the hospital here and the missionary are willing to refund part of the profits they may receive in future, to contribute towards the purchase of a piano.\n\nTrusting that you will regard with favor my request, thanking you in advance,\n\nI remain\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nMary E. Burke,\nPrincipal.\n\nCaughnawaga.\nOct 17, 1913.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI am pleased to learn that it is you who have replaced Mr. Ridley. I know you take a lively interest in the progress and welfare in general of the Indians. During one of your visits to Bainganaga you encouraged much the entertainments given by the pupils of the girls' school here. The children are clever along this line, especially in calisthenics, drill etc., but it is impossible to continue these exercises without the use of a piano.\n\nI have made application to the Dept. for one, on more than one occasion, and though I have never received a favorable reply, I know that this is not due to a want of generosity on the part of the Department, nor is it a question of money\u2014possibly a matter of principle.\nI have written now, through the agent, to request the Department to help us to procure a piano, and I ask you to kindly use your influence in favor of my request.\n\nA piano will be of great service in the training of the children, and will also help the good works on the reserve by the profits obtained from the children's entertainments.\n\nThanking you for such favors, and for whatever you may do for us now.\n\nI remain, dear Mr. Scott,\n\nVery Gratefully Yours,\n\nMary E. Burke,\nPrincipal\n\nGirls' School,\nBurghnawaga.\nOct. 16, 1913.\nOctober 22nd, 1917.\n\nDear Miss Burke,\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of the 15th instant, which reached me only this morning. I am very sorry the Department cannot come to your assistance to obtain a piano for use in the Caughnawaga Girls' school. There are musical instruments in use in several of our day schools, but in no case has the Department contributed towards their purchase.\n\nI think that in a thriving village like Caughnawaga it should be possible with the assistance of friends outside to raise funds for this purpose, and I would like to see the people make some effort themselves along this line under your direction. I wish you would try to see what can be done in this way. The winter season is now coming on, and a series of entertainments would no doubt give good returns.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMiss Mary E. Burke,\nPrincipal,\nGirls' School,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDecember 2, 1913.\n\nMay it Please Your Grace,-\n\nAs your Grace is no doubt aware, there are two schools of two rooms each in the Village of Caughnawaga conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. These schools are in charge of lay teachers, and, while successful to some degree, are not so efficient as those conducted under the same auspices in other places. The Department is of opinion that much better results would be attained if nuns holding teachers' certificates could be placed in charge of both the boys' and the girls' schools. The results achieved on other reserves by these devoted women are very gratifying, and I am sure that if we could secure their services at Caughnawaga the interests of the Indian youths would be much better served in many respects. Could such an arrangement be mutually agreed\n\nMost Rev. Paul Bruchesi, F.R.S.C.,\nArchbishop of Montreal,\nMontreal, Que.\nupon, to take effect next summer, the Department would in the meantime furnish comfortable living quarters in the village and in close proximity to church and schools. I have had communication with the Mother Superior of the Grey Nuns in Ottawa and I think they would be willing to undertake the work if Your Grace would give consent. I shall be pleased to hear from Your Grace at your convenience.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Grace's obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sir:\n\nI could not answer until now your letter of the 2nd inst. I would be happy to meet your wishes and enter into your views relatively to the two Catholic schools at Caughnawaga. I would point out that the Grey Nuns of Ottawa are not within my jurisdiction, nor have they any institutions in my diocese.\n\nThere are in Montreal other religious orders, under whose direction Indian schools are conducted with success in the West and in British Columbia. I could certainly find amongst them teachers with diplomas, qualified in every respect to impart a good education to the children of Caughnawaga.\n\nI shall write to you on receipt of more precise information, or should you prefer it, I shall be pleased to see you and talk over this question in all its details.\n\nI have the honour to be, dear Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMr. Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nDecember 22nd, 1918.\n\nMay it please Your Grace -\n\nI have to thank Your Grace for your very kind letter of the 13th instant, relative to the Caughnawaga schools and for the encouragement given that we may hope to be able to obtain the services of Sisters with qualifications to take charge of the schools. Your Grace will understand that there will be considerable expenditure involved in providing proper housing accommodation for the Sisters and I do not wish to take any steps until assured that they will be available. When Your Grace obtains further definite information I shall be pleased to hear from you. I presume it will not be possible to make the change before the holiday season next Summer; this would give a fair notice to the teachers at present engaged and would also permit the Department to erect a suitable building.\n\nShould I be in Montreal, in the near future, I shall\n\nMost Rev.

I have taken the opportunity to ask him about the eyesight of our pupils. He finds it very poor. 37% of them need spectacles.\n\nThe boys, it seems, are not nearly so much in need as the girls, though the eyesight of a few is very poor.\n\nI beg leave to ask if the Department will help us in this really urgent need. On making inquiries, I find that an optician will come from Montreal and test the eyes of the children, charging only what the spectacle cost: About two dollars perhaps two dollars and a half a pair.

It is thought by the Department that this would be a most judicious move both for the welfare of the schools and the Indians of the village. It is only the schools in the village in which it is proposed to make a change.\n\nThere are, as you are no doubt aware, two modern buildings fitted at present with two class-rooms each and with accommodation, if necessary, for a third class-room in each building. It is proposed to provide for the Sisters suitable living accommodation at a location readily accessible and I should esteem it a favour if you would inform me as to the accommodation that you would desire to have, bearing in mind\n\nRev. Mother Superior,\nSisters of St. Ann,\nLachine, Que.\nthat in the near future it will probably be necessary to have three teachers in each of these schools, the Boys' and the Girls'.\n\nWe would wish to make conditions as comfortable as possible for those engaged in the work, and will erect a suitable building for residence. I should be pleased to have an intimation of your willingness to undertake this work after the summer holidays. This would give due notice to those at present engaged and enable us to select a site and proceed with the erection of a building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMontreal, February 12th, 1914.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have spoken to the Reverend Sisters of St-Ann at Lachine, concerning the establishment of their Sisters at Caughnawaga.

I shall be at your service at any time, provided you inform me of the appointment beforehand. I shall merely mention that we need in our convent besides kitchen, pantry, etc., dining-room, bed-rooms for principal, teachers and cook, a chapel, community-room, parlor and guests' sleeping-rooms.

Although the teachers' absence prevented us from obtaining admittance into the school buildings, I must say that we were favorably impressed by their exterior aspect. The distant location of the boys' school is the only point which might have prompted hesitation in accepting the proposition; but since, as you state in your gracious letter of the 14th inst., you shall be pleased to provide some\nmeans of conveyance for the teachers who shall be employed there, we shall, I trust, be able to accept the direction of both establishments.\n\nThe spot adjoining the river bank which has been selected as the future site of the Sisters' residence also seems a very desirable one.\n\nThanking you again for your kindly interest.

Broseau, Asst. Indian Agent.\n\nRes. 1.\n\nReferring to the contemplated change of hands of teachers on the reserve, it appears that the nuns will replace the Indian teachers. The services of nuns are not wanted here, simply because we have available teachers whom have already fulfilled their duties satisfactorily up to the present time, for reason of the above cited, Councillors Dr. A.D. Patton, Michel Morris have dissented to allow the nuns to teach on the reserve. Michel Montour is abstaining from voting while J.M. Jocks, Louis Delisle, are in favour, are in favour and assented to by Chief Jacobs, in which they are strongly desirous that graded schools be provided with eligibility to higher schools.\n\nAdopted unanimously.\n\nTrue Copy.\n\nJ.

P. Delisle, of the Caughnawaga Indian reserve, who is here to enter a protest with the Department of Indian Affairs against a proposed change in the educational system of the reserve.\n\nIt is proposed to have the teaching on the reserve done in future by an order of nuns, to replace the present lay teachers. The idea was met with favor among the Indians, who have held several meetings to protest against the alteration. At the last, Mr. Delisle was selected to carry the objections of the Indians to the government.\n\nPETITION IN OWN LANGUAGE.\n\nAt the conclusion of this meeting Mr. Delisle displayed a petition written in the Indian language, setting forth the objections of the members of the reserve to any change. The petition protests against the government granting permission to \"any religious order\" to reside within the limits of the reserve or to preside in any of the schools.\n\n\"Our fathers,\" it continues, \"have always strenuously opposed their entry and now we must persist to refuse to allow them coming in the reserve, for many and obvious reasons.\" The re-\nProtection of Cayuga Indians against the encroachment of white men upon their Cayuga reserve.\n\nChief John Sly\n\nJosie Satkonisatis\n\nMrs. Monck\n\nMr. William Barnes\n\nMr. Mark H.

Anne. On that occasion the good sisters had arranged a nice little dramatic and musical evening, which charmed me very much. I came back with the idea that our young Indians of Caughnawaga can compare with advantage beside any other nationality of the country. I noticed in these young children an air of intelligence that struck me. Their English pronunciation is good, and their manner in appearing before the public is without reproach. I am under the impression that the education of my young Indians is in good hands; and I should say that for Caughnawaga there is being prepared a new mentality that will be for the greatest good of the Iroquois of this reserve. The predecessors of the nuns were certainly good school-masters and school-mistresses; but permit me to make the remark, Mr. Superintendent, that for our Indians I attach more importance to education than to instruction. The formation of the character of a young Indian is the main point; and I do not hesitate to say that the nuns are more competent than any one else in this respect. The children appear to like their teachers and have great respect for them. In a word, I am quite satisfied with the manner in which these ladies are conducting their schools.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nJ.M. Brosseau,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nHier au soir, le conseil a \u00e9t\u00e9\nen le plaisir d'assister \u00e0 la distribution des\npr\u00eats des \u00e9coles de Caughnawaga dirig\u00e9es\npar les Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de St Anne. \u00c0 cette occasion,\nles bonnes soeurs avaient organis\u00e9 une f\u00eate\ns\u00e9ance dramatique et musicale qui m'a\nbeaucoup charm\u00e9. Je suis heureux de voir\nque nos jeunes Indiens de Caughnawaga\npeuvent figurer avec avantage \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de\ntoute autre nation de la province. J'ai re-\nmarqu\u00e9 sur ces jeunes filles un air\nd'intelligence qui m'a fait dire que leur pro-\nmotion est excellente, et je crois\naussi que nous devons \u00eatre fiers de l'impre-\nsion qu'elle a faite sur les autres Indiens\nde cette bonne maison, et je serais\npour Caughnawaga, il se pr\u00e9pare une\nmentalit\u00e9 nouvelle qui sera pour le plus\ngrand bien des Indiens de cette r\u00e9serve.\nLes premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es de cette \u00e9ducation\nseraient certainement de bons instituteurs et\ninstitutrices, mais permettez-moi de vous\nfaire remarquer, monsieur le directeur,\nque, pour nos Indiens, j'attache plus\nd'importance \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation qu'\u00e0 l'instruc-\ntion. La formation du caract\u00e8re des peuples\nIndiens, voici le point capital, et je ne peux\npas d\u00e9clarer que les religieuses sont plus\nSir,\n\nJe vous prie de bien vouloir faire part \u00e0 toutes les personnes concern\u00e9es de l'importance de cette affaire et de leur demander de bien vouloir respecter les instructions donn\u00e9es.\n\nJ'ai l'honneur de me soumettre,\nMonsieur le Secr\u00e9taire,\nVotre ob\u00e9issant serviteur.\n\nJ.M.

Anne.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased to learn that the pupils at these schools have made such good progress under the direction of the Sisters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nMost esteemed Sir:\n\nYour very welcome favor of the 27th inst. is much appreciated and I beg leave to return thanks for the permission granted. The words of encouragement you so kindly addressed will serve as a stimulus to higher actions, coming from you most esteemed Sir they bear weight not only to the little Community of Caughnawaga but also to our entire settlement.\n\nThe School repairs are completed and I am well satisfied with them.\nMr. Chinni endeavoured to have things well done at as little expense as possible.\n\nI have heard with pleasure that you intend coming to Caughnawaga soon. I am very desirous to form your acquaintance, and shall have many things to speak of when I meet you.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYours most respectfully,\n\nSr. Mr. Edward Principal\nCaughnawaga, Sept. 25, 1845\n\nK. Scott\n\nOttawa.\n\nEsteemed Sir,\n\nI beg leave to return my heartfelt appreciation of the very kind words of encouragement contained in your last letter. Our work here among the Iroquois children is not of the easiest owing to their indolent and uncertain nature, yet we face the task as bravely as possible.\n\nThe school opened with a very good\nattendance. The children seemed much pleased to return to school. I was obliged to open a fourth class in the Boys' School. I have waited until now to ask your authorization of same because I thought we needed the privilege and the pleasure of seeing you in Cunningham. I equipped the new class with the left over tools in both schools. The only thing wanting is the teacher's desk. The same necessity exists in the Girls' School, for the third class is overcrowded. We can have a classroom in the former school building adjacent one, for the present. We would need forty-eight single desks for children from six to nine years, with teacher's desk. I shall await your authorization extended Sir. I beg leave to say that\nThere is a typewriter out of use in the Department. I would gladly accept it for the Girls' School. The parents ask for the girls to have the same privilege as the boys.\n\nHon. and esteemed Sir, before concluding I would beg to say how grateful I feel to learn that the Girls' School yard which is already very small may probably be made smaller. If I dare to express a request I would beg you in settle that the fence be left in its present dimensions. There seems that an making the trouble reason like our own hope, and if the question lies for a few months they will probably forget it.\n\nThanking you anew for all you have done in improving our Schools.\n\nI remain\n\nYours most gratefully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nSeptember 29th., 1915.\n\nDear Madam -\n\nI have to ask you to be kind enough to forward me a copy of the programme of studies followed each day of the week in both the boys and girls' schools at Caughnawaga.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

D. E. Scott,\nOttawa.\n\nMost esteemed sir,\n\nI beg to apologize for any delay in sending the required program of the schools. I am constantly kept very busy in the schools. I presume you will take note that the time given to each subject is short but that the lesson is daily recurrence. The savage child, tired of everything long, I am therefore endeavoring to find a means of obtaining good results. If, therefore, he finds it necessary to make suggestions to better conditions, they shall be most gladly accepted and faithfully followed. Although not mentioned on the program, we are\nthing every means available to have\nthe children speak good English.\nWe are much pleased to adopt the\nOntario Methods of Instruction which\nare evidently the best in the Dominion\nof Canada.\n\nExtending Sir,\n\nWith the highest consideration\n\nYours most respectfully,\n\nSr. Dr. Edward, Principal.\nOttawa, October 9th, 1915.\n\nDear Madam -\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, with programme of studies at the Caughnawaga Schools, for which I wish to thank you.\n\nMr. Scott is at present absent from the city, and on his return your letter will be brought to his attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Sister Mary Edward,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga Indian Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nOctober 30, 1915.\n\nDear Madam,\n\nI have much pleasure in acknowledging the receipt of your programme of studies at the Caughnawaga schools, and I have looked over this with interest. At present I would not suggest any definite changes; I sent for it expressly for the purpose of seeing what time you are allowing for devotional exercises, catechism and religious instruction. Some of the Indians who profess opposition to the present management stated to me that too much time was so occupied, and that the educational interests of the children were correspondingly neglected.\n\nI am putting you frankly in possession of this criticism so that you may be able to reply to me if you think it necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Sister Mary Edward,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nPrincipal,\nCaughnawaga Indian Schools,\nCaughnawaga, Que.\nMontreal, Que.\nNov 14, 1875\n\nMr. Benson,\nOttawa.\n\nEsteemed Sir,\n\nI wish to ascertain whether or not my discharge came from Ottawa. I have been teaching in the Boys' School in Caughnawaga since the arrival of the Sister in January last until October 28th, when I received my discharge on 24 hours notice and told that my services were no longer required. The reason assigned was that I had no diploma and that the Ottawa people had complained.\n\nIf such be the case why not have complained before since I am led to believe Sister Mary Edward fully notified Ottawa of this before my going to teach there.\nWhy did you not give sufficient notice or something like that engage me for another term and discharge me at the end of two months without sufficient warning?\n\nAs far as I can find out after two weeks search that is the only cause of my dismissal. I wish to state that I have had no trouble with the Indian people. I always found them courteous even those opposed to the Sisters.\n\nSomeone has attacked my name and Friday last saying that the name given in the quarterly report for September for Standard 1 and 2 of the Day's School was Miss Roberts. Now I wish to notify you if such be the case that I am the one who was teacher of that class and made out that report although I was not permitted to sign my name. (Mary Demigan)\n\nI am thrown out of work and must rely on the good will of my...\nparents to support me.\n\nAnother thing I would like to know is how much salary does the Government allow to teachers of Standard Land?\n\nNow I think that as recompense for the wrong done me I have sufficient grounds to claim my salary.\n\nAs a proof that I was teaching in Caughmanaga Mr. Brescan, your agent, visited my class on the Monday preceding my dismissal and judging from his outward appearance he seemed pleased with the class.\n\nAn immediate settlement of this affair would prove very beneficial to me.\n\nWith an apology,\n\nSincerely,\n\nA true Canadian\n\nMary Durmegar\n\n19-6 Azelair St\n\nMontreal.\nOttawa, November 16, 1915.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 14th instant addressed to Mr. Benson of this Department I beg to say that the Boys' and Girls' Roman Catholic Schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve are under the control and management of the Sisters of St. Anne and the Department has no knowledge of the terms of your engagement with them. The arrangements made with the Sisters called for teachers holding professional qualifications, who were to be paid at the following rates, $500.00 for the principal, $400.00 for the first assistant and $300.00 for the second assistant. Any claim you have for salary should be made to them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and secretary.\n\nMiss Mary Durnigan,\n79 Gazebo St.,\nMontreal, Que.\nLanghamaga, Jan. 27, 1916.\n\nHon. L. C. Scott,\nOttawa.\n\nMost esteemed Sir:\n\nIt seems to me that it is a duty incumbent upon me to inform you from time to time how our schools are progressing, and doubly so on account of the deep interest you express in the welfare of said schools. I am gratified today in being able to say that everything is going on well, and that we are steadily gaining the confidence of the people. The children are showing satisfactory progress notwithstanding their Indian mentality, and the drawback of not having had prior to our coming sufficient English in the Boys'\nSchool. Some of the senior boys have expressed the wish to have good Mr. Scott's picture in their classroom. One of cabinet size would do. The senior class of girls would also appreciate the favor very much. However, if you consider my request too forward, please take no notice of it. I like the idea. It will teach the children respect and admiration for those who are doing so much for them.\n\nDear esteemed Mr. Scott\u2014May I call your attention to the fact that it will be impossible for us to accept our present residence for another school year. It seems much too small for us, not speaking of the many inconveniences caused by the want of (many) of the indispensable requirements of a home. I therefore pray you send Mr. Scott to consider our case and have the Scott residence begun in early spring so that we may occupy it in September next.\n\nAnother thing which I must bring to your notice is that since January 1915\nI have done the work of principal of the two schools here without remuneration for same. I have worked daily in the classes from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. When in preparation for concerts I have worked from 8 to 6 P.M. so as not to interfere with classes here. The schools are 34 mile apart, bad weather or bad walking were prevented me from reaching the schools at the appointed time. Mother M. Melanie and Superior General urge me to put this matter before you. I would not solicit a high salary but would accept with gratitude $500.00 per year, first payment dating from Sept. of this school year September last. Mother General can not accept to have the teachers' salary here to contribute to more as our expenses here are very high. We must get all our provisions etc. from Montreal, and with transport charges of same, everything costs us a great deal. I feel convinced that when you consider the hard work I have to accomplish here...\nYou will willingly extend to me the same privilege you so generously give to principals doing less arduous work. The task of principal is a difficult one and particularly so when the schools must be raised to a better standard.\n\nI am presently engaged in forming a company of boys to instil a military and patriotic spirit in our young Squawkin boys.\n\nBefore concluding I must ask you Mr. Sir, to pardon this lengthy letter. I had many things to say, and I felt you would listen with indulgence to all.\n\nWith the highest consideration,\n\nI have the honor to be, esteemed Sir,\n\nYour humble and grateful servant,\n\nH. M.
