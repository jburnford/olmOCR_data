The unemployed in London are showing their strength by the fact that they ask for work to be given them, and no doubt many of them are anxious for something to do, but it always happens in cases of this kind that the employed class are too weak to turn out and take part in labor demonstrations and help to swell the crowd. A compact population in Britain usually finds relief by the strong current flowing into the country. Our unemployed always get their share. At present Canada is not in want of additional immigrants of that class, the labor market being amply supplied. It is long overdue for those setting in and little thought made for those who are already out of employment, the outlook for outside labor as far as Canada is concerned is very bright. Sympathy for even an old of employ- ment is well enough in its place, but the men themselves would much rather have employment than sympathy.\n\nIt has been apparent all along notwithstanding what is being said by commercial unionists, that the fishery commission will deal only with fishermen, leaving the question of wages, hours, and conditions to be settled by the employers. It is not at all likely that our neighbors will accept any settlement that will enable them to pay less cash for the fish they purchase from us. When the Halifax award was made, giving Canada five and a half millions of dollars for twelve years' use of the fisheries, the United States took all the fish they could get, doing a great deal of grumbling, and ever since that time our Yankee cousins have protested that they were swindled in the transaction, but they will take good care that the coming Canadian award gets the start of them again. There is plenty of fish in the sea for everybody who desires to catch them, and what is very likely to be the outcome of the whole affair is that the fishermen in an agreement that American fishermen shall be permitted to fish within the Canadian three mile limit on condition that Canadian fish shall be admitted free to the United States. This is something very much less than the unrestricted reciprocity of which we hear so much. It will be unrestricted reciprocity, indeed, but only in fish. Our neighbors have every reason to use the Canadian fisheries, and, though Canada does not like manufacturing but business, and the like common sense will impel the people of the Saskatchewan to seek the shortest route to their final market. Another thing is that the opening of the new railway promises that hard arsion. If free railway communication with the United States is to be opened up, there is no good reason why the people of the north to south Winnipeg for eastward trade should not be able to do so. The people of Ontario may aspire to be the distributing point, with a line leading direct to Western Manitoba at Brad- ford. If railway competition is to be had at all, it will be a competition for Manitobans, not a scheme of putting money into the pockets of Win- nipeg. If new railways are to be built, Western Manitoba should not consider the possibility of securing to produce all the way to Brad- ford. Short routes must be built in the interests of the farmers. Winnipeg is not the whole of Mani- toba. Still less is it the whole of the North-west.\n\nMatters are not so bad in this country as they seem to be on the other side of the ocean.
