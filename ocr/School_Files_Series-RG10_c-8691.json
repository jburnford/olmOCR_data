Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to improvements at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. I am returning your file, and I am today writing to Mr. Inspector Bunn, authorizing him to purchase the metallic ceiling, the tables and benches and the mower and rake. Please let Mr. Bunn have access to your files showing the prices you have received, as this will help him in awarding the business.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Dr. Westgate has secured prices, and he has been requested to let you have access to his file, which will help you in awarding the business to the best advantage. You may purchase the metallic ceiling required for the dining room, at a cost of $96.09 F.O.B. Prince Albert. You may also purchase a 3\u00bd' mower and a 9' rake. This business should be awarded to either the Cockshutt Plow Company, Winnipeg, who have already quoted to Dr. Westgate, or to the Saskatoon office of the Massey-Harris Company, who are going to quote. You, of course, will select the lowest quotation.\n\nYou may also arrange with either the Cusson Lumber Company, St. Boniface, or Cushing Bros., Saskatoon, both of whom have been asked to quote, for the supplying of 12 dining room tables and 24 benches. The dining room tables should be 5' x 6', with brown battleship linoleum tops, properly bound with brass. Cushing Bros. of Saskatoon have not yet quoted to Dr. Westgate. The Cusson Lumber Company of St. Boniface have quoted, but have substituted oilcloth for the linoleum. Have them amend their quotation so as to conform to the specifications, i.e., battleship linoleum, bound with brass.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. R.

In your letter of the 9th instant, you ask the Department to reimburse your Society for food supplies for patients. This suggests that Indians, other than pupils, are being given hospital treatment by the nurse. The Department wishes to know what building is being used. Further, if the practice of taking in out-patients were discontinued, would there be sufficient room for the proper care of pupils who are sick?\n\nYour Society has lately indicated that a hospital is required for the Indians of this community. As it may be some time before the Department can give consideration to this proposal, which involves a large appropriation, I am writing to ascertain the exact situation, so that a decision can be reached regarding the infirmary accommodation for pupils of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

On Jan. 26th, the Rev. C. F. Hives, Principal of this institution, sent a telegram stating that the water in the well had given out and that he feared it would be necessary to connect the pumping system with the lake. He estimated the expenditure involved would be $70.00, and in view of the urgency of the situation, our Commission authorized him to proceed immediately.\n\nIn the covering letter which accompanied the enclosed account he writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I may say that our well gave out right in the very severe weather. We were unable to supply the building adequately, and the situation looked very serious. My first thought was to extend the pipe into the lake, and I estimated the cost at about seventy five dollars. Hence the wire to you. Then I thought that if it could be managed, the further sinking of the well would be the more permanent. The only thing against that was the very severe weather. But I got the men, and opened up the well. We made a crib, and sank the well until I was quite sure that we had an adequate supply. I was in the bottom of the well for two days. I am very pleased to say that we are now able to put on full pressure three times a day if need be, and I believe there will be water for all time to come.\"\nIn view of the prompt and energetic measures taken by the School Management and the success which attended the same, I trust that my request for the payment of this account may have your favourable consideration, and that a cheque for the amount in question will be issued in favour of the Hudson's Bay Company, Lac la Ronge, via Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nWith Cheque\n\nOttawa, March 5th., 1929.\n\nRev.

Yes.\n- Pupils in vocational training departments.\n- 1 pupil sick.\n- Pupils absent. Reasons: The June return shows average of 103 but some of the pupils are not carried over into July\u2014discharges, deaths etc.\n- Total number on roll: 102.\n\nAre there any pupils in residence whose admission has not been approved by the Department?\nOne pupil is being kept for a time as his parents are away from the reserve, he is not on the roll, being just a visitor.\n\nHEALTH, SANITATION, Etc.\n\nAppearance of pupils: Neat and healthy.\nCleanliness of school: Very clean. It can be seen that the school is always clean; it is not just tidied up for my visit.\nAppearance of school grounds: Grounds are clean, no refuse around the place anywhere.\nCare of the sick: The nurse attends to them but has no accommodation of any sort for sick children.\nThe meals at present are cereals, bread, peas, puddings, with fish as main food.\nThese are in good shape.\n\nVOCATIONAL TRAINING\n\nDomestic Instruction: Making and mending clothes, Laundry and kitchen work, Basket and weaving.\nInstruction in Farming and Gardening: Very slight as no land for the purpose except small garden. The hay is cut 20 miles off.\nTraining in the care of live stock: Just a few animals, no chance to keep many number as no feed available.\nHauling wood, Fishing, Gardening, Swimming.\nCare of agricultural machinery and other equipment: What is here is kept neatly.\n\nGENERAL\n\nDiscipline at the school: This is of the best. At same time the pupils are friendly and happy looking.\nEfficiency of the staff: This appears to be all right but two teachers are being let out for some reason other than their teaching.\nGeneral management: The Principal here cannot be improved on, he is of the best type; a good all-round man.\nSuggestions: Letter attached.\n\nForm No. 217\nMEMO.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose the report on Lac la Ronge Residential School. The children in the class rooms were all examined on the 10th. The class rooms were clean, well ventilated and the teaching was efficient. The senior teacher especially has brought her pupils along in good style; I am sorry that she is leaving. I put in the whole day in the rooms and can state that the work in every class is satisfactory. The pupils are only up to the sixth standard but if they get this far and understand the work it is enough for this district.\n\nThe hospital applied for here seems to have been refused. Some accommodation should be put up for sick pupils. The Principal recommends the following, and I think he is now agreeable to it in lieu of a special building. Put up a two story room at end of each wing, there is room between the windows etc for a place 16 X 20. One extension would contain nurse room below, ward above; the other a dispensary below and ward above. Mr. Hives says he would get it completed for $4000.00, furniture extra.\n\nOVER...........\nSix dozen hospital bed mattresses are required here, it is of no use to send mattresses unfilled, cases etc., as no material is available locally to fill them.\n\nOne hundred blankets are required here from some source.\n\nEighty-four (84) rubber stair treads 7x17\u00bd with same number brass nosings 18\" are required for stairways.\n\nTwenty (20) bushels lime required for plaster repairs.\n\nThree thousand (3000) feet B.M. fir flooring is required for classrooms and playrooms. The present flooring is worn out and is very dusty on account of open places in between old boards.\n\nI asked for church pews or seats for the pupils last year, they were not supplied. They are still needed.\n\nPractically all other items asked for were supplied.\n\nThe school is in good repair generally.\n\nThe Principal tells me he has asked for an appropriation for supplying food to sick Indians. He sends the cooked food to them when they are bed ridden on the reserve close by. This is not really a school matter but I thought I would mention it. He does supply this service and it is quite a drain on the school finances.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, July 24, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information, copy of official letter of today's date to the Rev. Principal of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. H. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. G.,\n59-45 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, July 24, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 307-11 of the 18th instant, enclosing Mr. Waddy's report on the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nSome time ago, the church authorities asked the Department to arrange for an infirmary for sick pupils. Mr. Waddy has also recommended this, and I am today authorizing the Rev. Principal, who is quite competent, to build a small addition at a cost of $2,000.\n\nI note Mr. Waddy recommends that 6 dozen mattresses be supplied. I am satisfied these are for the school dormitories, as Dr. Westgate has made a request in this connection. After you have heard from Mr. Waddy, please let me have a recommendation concerning the supplying of mattresses.\n\nThe Department is authorizing the Principal to purchase 20 bushels of lime for plaster repairs and 5,000 ft. of flooring. The church authorities will have to be responsible for the church pews and for 100 blankets.\n\nYou will receive a further communication with reference to food for sick Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nM. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, July 24, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Indian Agent Waddy has reported concerning the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School, and he urges that some accommodation be provided for sick pupils. You are hereby authorized to erect a small addition at one end of the main building. $2,000 only is available for this purpose, and the Department will be pleased if you will see that the expenditure is kept within this amount. I regret that a second addition at the other wing of the building cannot be authorized at the present time. The Department is hopeful that you may be able to arrange the space in your building with this one addition so that adequate accommodation can be provided for sick pupils.\n\nYou are authorized to purchase 20 bushels of lime for plaster repairs, 3000 ft. of fir flooring and 7 dozen rubber stair treads with brass nosings. Accounts for these materials and for those in connection with the addition should be certified, in duplicate, and forwarded to Ottawa for payment. When you require funds to pay any labour engaged for the addition, you may make application to Ottawa for an accountable cheque.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Waddy is being requested to give a further report regarding the need for 6 dozen mattresses. The church pews and blankets mentioned by our representative should be provided by the Missionary Society.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Charles F.

(RG 10, Volume 6316, file 656-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI beg to say that your letter of July 15th, received today was very greatly appreciated, as also your letter of July 24th, also received today. I assure you that the thousand dollars you have kindly granted for clearing will be of great assistance for that purpose, but more so will it be so greatly appreciated by the Indians who are in very poor circumstances, and need the money which they will get for work executed.\n\nThe $2000.00 for the purpose of providing accommodation for sick pupils should help us in that respect, and I assure you that it will be used to the best advantage. We are also thankful for the fir flooring, stair treads, and I do sincerely hope that you may see fit to provide the mattresses. I may say in this respect that we have not anything in the way of filling for mattresses in this country. We have no grain field nearer than one hundred and fifty miles away.\n\nMay I say a word in regard to the request for blankets. When our pupils are sent away on their vacation they are given a quilt each. I find that this is really a necessity. The parents of these children are poor. They have nothing but just what they actually need themselves, so that when an extra child comes into the home, unless it brings along with it what it will require in the way of bedding, that child has to either go without and suffer discomforts or even worse, or share with someone else. We have always tried to provide one quilt each for our pupils when they go on their holidays, and when they leave school after graduating, we give them two. I may say that there is also another side to this matter beside guarding the child against discomforts etc. Many of our pupils are growing girls verging on to young womanhood. If such a girl has not anything in the\nway of bedding you may realize how dependant she is upon other resources. I have known of a great deal in the way of immorality amongst our young Indians, and have traced its origin in a number of cases to the fact that the poor girl had no bedding. Our Indian girls and boys are very anxious to keep straight. Just as anxious as we are to help them, and no matter what the cause may be that would bring about the downfall of a girl's character, I feel we should guard against it.\n\nAfter a child has been home for six weeks, I mean for his vacation, the quilt is almost useless. This is easily accounted for when one considers the roaming life they lead, and the poor accommodation they have. Last year we gave out a quilt to each child, and out of the hundred or more given out there were not more than half a dozen fit to be taken in again.\n\nThis depletes our supply of bedding until the situation is becoming serious. For that reason I asked Mr Indian Agent Waddy if anything could be done to help us out.\n\nIf after reading this and appreciating the need we have for extra blankets, the Department can see fit to provide us with what Mr Indian Agent Waddy asked for, I assure you that we shall be very greatly assisted in our work with our Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas.

It would take about twenty gallons to give the floors two coats. I would like to suggest Sherwin Williams \"Floor Seal\" oil, which would not only act as a wood preserver, but would make the floors very easy to keep clean.\n\nI would also ask the Department if it would supply this school with forty yards of linoleum, one yard wide, for the upstairs corridor of this building. I would also like to have the same quantity of felt paper to put under it. At present the floor is carpeted, but the carpet is in very bad condition, and will have soon to be replaced. I hope the department may be able to grant this request.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n**The Canadian Office & School Furniture Co., Limited**\n\nManufacturers of Office, School, Church, Lodge and Opera Furniture Bank, Office, Hotel, Drug and Jewelry Store and Court House Fittings\n\nA Specialty\n\nPRESTON, ONT.\n\nDecember 3, 1929.\n\nSOLD TO Department of Indian Affairs, Canada,\n\nNo. 42258-C Ottawa, Ontario.\n\n| CONVEYANCE | C.F.P. prepaid | TERMS | net |\n|------------|----------------|-------|-----|\n| 11/23/29   |                |       |     |\n| 6          | No. 2 B.B.A. single desks | 9.10 | 54.60 |\n| 5          | No. 6 \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" | 8.60 | 51.60 |\n| Sales tax included | | | |\n| K.D. one set up | f.o.b.

I am ordering now, so as to take advantage of the winter freighting rates, which are 60% lower than the summer rates. If your department can take care of this matter, I shall be greatly obliged.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa 4th April, 1930.\n\nRevd Sir,\n\nIn your letter of the 24th August, 1939, you made request for an accountable cheque for $500.00 to pay wages to Indians working in connection with an addition to the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. On the 30th August, the Department sent you official cheque No 2915 for the amount stated. The Department's books for the fiscal year 1929-1930, against which the cheque was drawn are about to close and therefore, I have to request that you will lose no time in accounting for the money. If there is an unexpended balance in your hands it should be refunded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRevd. Charles F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nLac La Ronge,\nSask.\nWinnipeg, Man. April 17, 1930\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE: GRANT FOR INFIRMARY AT LAC LA RONGE.\n\nI shall be obliged if you will kindly let me know if the unexpended balance of the grant of $2,000.00 sanctioned in your letter of July 24th, 1929, No.132-2-5, and addressed to the Rev. C. F. Hives, for providing an infirmary at our Lac la Ronge School, will be available during the current fiscal year. It is to be regretted that the infirmary was not completed before the last fiscal year closed, but this was due to the change of Principals.\n\nFurther, as you state in your letter to Mr. Hives that he might apply to you for an accountable cheque to meet the cost of labour, engaged to help in building the infirmary, I shall be glad to know the amount of any such cheque which you may have issued, so that I may inform the present Principal, namely, the Rev. G. W. Fisher, of the amount still available to complete the Infirmary out of the total grant sanctioned.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.B.W./W\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, April 23, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to last year's grant for an infirmary at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. I regret that there was no revote in this connection; but I may say that the Estimates provide $1,300 for improvements at this school. This amount was divided as follows:\n\n- Ice house - $500.\n- Flooring and general repairs - $800.\n\nIf the infirmary is more urgent than these other improvements, it will be possible to complete it. Please let me have your recommendation without delay.\n\nConcerning the $800 which was advanced to the former principal in August of last year, I may say that the amount was deposited with the Imperial Bank of Canada at Prince Albert. I find that on the 4th instant the Department wrote the Reverend Principal, asking for an accounting and for a refund of any unexpended balance. If there is any unexpended balance, provided the Reverend Principal can use it immediately in connection with the labour or improvement at the school, it will be in order to send in the accounting for the entire amount within the next few weeks. You might so inform the Principal, and it might be advisable for you also to write the Imperial Bank, telling them to hold the unexpended balance on departmental cheque No. 2919 for $800 until the Rev. Principal writes them further. It is entirely probable that he has now written to the Bank, asking them to make the refund to the Department. This will not be necessary, provided the funds can be used in the immediate future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

(RG 10, Volume 6316, file 656-5, part 4)\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of April 23rd last, re the unexpended balance, etc., of the grant made by your Department last year for an infirmary at our Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School, I beg to state that immediately after receiving your letter I wrote to the Rev. C. W. Fisher, principal of this school, and asked him to take in hand at once the work of completing the infirmary, so far as the unexpended balance of the grant would meet the same.\n\nIt would appear from information received from the Principal that the unexpended balance amounted to $458.00. He immediately placed an order for the items given on the enclosed statement from the T. Eaton Co., and which amounts to $198.46, including the commission on his cheque which accompanied the order. This would leave a further balance of $254.54. As the freight has to be paid on the shipment all the way through from Winnipeg to Lac la Ronge, it is probable that the greater part of this amount will be required to meet the same. The weight according to the enclosed bill of lading is 1,925 lbs., and the summer freight rate from Prince Albert to Lac la Ronge is 7\u00bd\u00a2 per lb. This charge, along with charges for handling in Prince Albert and the freight from Winnipeg to Prince Albert, will probably consume the greater part, if not the whole, of the balance mentioned. A further statement will be submitted to you when the goods have been delivered and the freighting and handling charges met. I have thought it well, however, to forward to you the enclosed bills which I have certified, in order to avoid the delay which would be involved if they were returned to the Principal for his certification.\nTrusting this may meet with your approval,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\n[Handwritten note]\nPlease refund to Principal $198.46 from current vote.\n\n[Handwritten note]\n1719\n\n[Handwritten note]\nJune 18-6-30\n\n[Handwritten note]\nTo Mr. M. Fisher, Sec'y\n\n[Handwritten note]\nSave la Roche, Sec'y\nOttawa, June 17th, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with enclosures, regarding an accountable cheque for $800.00 which was directed last year to the Reverend Principal of the Lae La Ronge Indian Residential School for the purpose of paying labour on the infirmary addition. This was sent to Mr. Hives on August 30th, upon receipt of his communication of the 24th idem.\n\nI regret that the method of accounting for this cheque which is suggested in your letter would not be accepted by the Auditor General. In the first place, this accountable cheque was not for the purpose of paying for materials or for freighting, etc. It was for labour. The Department believes that the only satisfactory way of accounting for this advance will be to refund by school cheque, without delay, the unexpended balance, amounting to $453.00. The time sheets for the expended amount of $347.00 should be forwarded to the Department, in duplicate, at the earliest possible date. The account which you forwarded will be paid from the current year's appropriation. A cheque for $198.46, in reimbursement, is now being directed to the Reverend Principal. When accounts for other materials or for freighting come to hand, these will be met in the new Vote.\n\nI am enclosing an extra copy of this letter, which you may direct to the Reverend Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I find that there is considerable repair work required for this School in a small way, also some interior equipment.\n\nI would also like to recommend that an addition be built to the rear of the West wing, which is the boys' classroom and dormitory, as they are short of space in the dormitory to accommodate the boys. They also require a room for the hospital and nurses' quarters, which could be in the new addition. This new addition could be the same width as this wing, that is, 40 x 60 feet, and the same height as the old building, being two story. I would like to recommend that if the Department anticipate the construction of this addition that an architect be employed to draw up the plans.\n\nAttached herewith I hand three copies of list of Requirements for Lac La Ronge School.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

As you state in your letter that you had not received a reply to your letter of April 23rd, concerning the most urgent requirements at this school, I beg to state that I have examined our files, and find that I wrote to you on June 10th, stating that I had requested the Principal to take in hand at once the work of completing the infirmary. Certain materials were purchased by the Principal for this purpose, but as the winter trail had closed, this material is held at Prince Albert.\n\nDuring the past summer our Commission's representative visited Lac la Ronge and after hearing his report on the plan recommended for the infirmary by Mr. Hives, before his transfer to the Shingwauk Home, our Commission decided that it would be better to have the whole question of the infirmary reconsidered. During my visit to your Department September 17th last, I took this matter up with the Director of Medical Services, and on October 1st, addressed to him a letter setting forth in writing the understanding reached during that interview. So far, then, as the infirmary at Lac la Ronge is concerned, the whole question will have to be considered afresh, and a new grant of funds made to meet the cost of the same, plus the cost of the freight on the material now at Prince Albert.\n\nAs the erection of the infirmary is, therefore, postponed, but only for a short time, I hope our Commission will receive authority to provide the improvements mentioned in your letter of Oct. 8th. I am sending a copy of your letter forward at once to the Rev. G. W. Fisher, the Principal of this school,\nand am asking him to furnish me with the measurements and quantities required in connection with each of the items you have listed. In view of the understanding reached with regard to the infirmary, our Commission will concur in your opinion that these improvements should take precedence over the infirmary, and they will be obliged if you will authorize them to provide the same.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The information is not complete as he wrote his letter before he received the one I had addressed to him, but in view of the urgency of some of the requirements, I thought it well to forward to you at once the following extract from his letter:\n\n\"You will note that I am asking for a 300 gallon hot water tank. I feel this is very necessary, for at the present time all the hot water for the children's bath has to be heated on the laundry stoves, and carried up in pails. This not only entails a great deal of work, but I feel sure that the amount of water used is not sufficient, when one considers the number of children we have in the school. I have no means of ascertaining just what this tank will cost to instal. I would judge however, that including the necessary pipes and fittings, together with the freight, it would amount to $350 to $400. I do hope the Department will give us this.\n\n\"With regard to our kitchen range, it was felt that by inserting new fire brick (or linings to the fire boxes) this would do for quite a time. But I am sorry to say...\"\nthe range is getting worse all the time. Mr. Hastings did put in a temporary lining of asbestos pulp, but this has already burned out again. I would like to suggest that the Indian Dept. be asked to supply a new range. Here again, I have no way of finding the cost.\n\n\"I have also had many complaints regarding the bread oven, and from personal observation, I would say that the bread does not appear to be all that it should be. I am informed that this is due to the oven. The doors are warped and much of the necessary heat escapes. Will you kindly ask for a new one. The present oven is certainly very far from satisfactory.\n\n\"We are also badly in need of a refrigerator. Would the Department supply this? The one listed on page 392 of Eaton's Spring and Summer catalogue, No. 424*M-230 would do very well. Its cost is $32.00.\n\n\"Attached to your letter dated April 26th, there is a copy of a letter from the Dept. in which it states that $500.00 was granted for building of an ice-house, and $800 for general repairs. Am I at liberty to prepare to use this money for the purposes mentioned. We are certainly in need of a new Ice-house, and with your permission, I think I could manage to do something towards it this fall. This letter is going out on the last plane to leave here this year. We expect the last mail by open water tomorrow, so if I am to do anything in this matter, it will be necessary for you to wire your instructions.\n\n\"During the past summer, I laid new floors in the two play-rooms, and in the junior class-room. This means that we have perfectly good floors in all the rooms downstairs except the Senior class-room. I would like to put a new floor there next summer. I would be glad to have you purchase 800 ft. of fir flooring. This could be sent in either in December or with the main freight in March.\n\n\"There has not been time since receiving your letter regarding the hospital to go fully into the matter. I will write you fully in the regular mail. I would like to suggest however that you ask an architect to draw up plans and specifications. (1) For a one storey building containing two wards, a nurse's room; dispensary; two bathrooms (one attached to nurse's room) with a full basement, heated by\n\"a small wood burning furnace, or (2) for a two storey building containing the same number of rooms, the nurse's room to be upstairs, and the dispensary downstairs. Of course a small kitchen would be necessary. I feel sure that we could manage to put up the building.\n\n\"I should have said that after consulting Nurse Patrick, it is thought that two four bed wards will be ample for our needs here.\n\n\"While I have no doubt that I could draw up a plan for the building, I feel very strongly that it might be cheaper in the end if a qualified architect were asked to plan the building. It would be easy for him to estimate costs on materials which would have to be shipped in.\"\n\nIn addition to the above the Principal has furnished me with a copy of the list of requirements which he sent to Mr. Walter Locke of Prince Albert who acted as treaty agent. As this list specifies in detail the requirements taken by the treaty paying officer, I am enclosing a copy of the same for your information, and trust that an authorization may be received to provide the same.\n\nI note that a kitchen range and a new bake oven are not included in this list, but after reading the Principal's letter I feel sure that both are required. With regard to the bake oven my recollection is that it was sent first to our Elkhorn School but being unsuitable for that institution, it was sent to the Lac la Ronge School. I am unable at present owing to lack of time to confirm my recollection in this matter, but in view of the danger which arises from the use of a defective range, I beg to recommend that the Principal's request for a new one be given sympathetic consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.Q.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6316, file 656-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 6, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has been giving consideration to your letters of the 14th and 17th ultimo, relative to the improvements at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. Payment of the September quarter grants and salaries has left the Appropriation for Indian Education in a rather alarming condition, and, if anything can be postponed to the new fiscal year, such action will have to be taken. I write now to enquire if the Department arranges for the following for this school, could the ordering be postponed so that shipment would be made in March and the accounts would reach the Department not earlier than the 15th of April:-\n\nPainting materials - $125.00\nLinoleum, blinds, lumber, etc. - 175.00\nBeds and mattresses - 225.00\nKitchen range and hot water tank with heater.\n\nYou might specify the type of hotel range and hot water tank with heater that is desired and the Department, in the regular way, will get prices.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. G.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\nNovember 25th, 1930.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMR. WILLIAMS:\n\nFor several years the Missionary Society of the Church of England has been urging the Department to build an infirmary or small hospital at Lac La Ronge. During the fiscal year 1929-1930 an amount of $2,000.00 was provided for this purpose and it was understood that it was to be expended on a small addition to the school building for hospital purposes. The building was not completed and the money was not re-voted in 1930-1931. Arrangements were made, however, to use part of the money provided for general repairs at the school to complete this work during the present year. Some material was bought and forwarded to Prince Albert, where it now lies waiting for winter freighting.\n\nIn September Dr. Westgate was here and said that as there were other matters more urgent at the school, and as the season was too late in any case, it was not proposed to complete the infirmary this year. Up to this point the matter has been in charge of the Schools Branch, and it was school funds which were to be used.\n\nDr. Westgate has now got a new report from the principal of the school, and we are asked to provide funds and to make a plan for the erection of a small hospital. Mr. Ferrier takes the apparently reasonable view that the greater part of the work to be done is not school work and should not be carried out under the auspices of his Branch.\nThe present situation is that we have a nurse at Lac La Ronge, who lives at the school but who gives attendance to all the people in the district. The work done under the original scheme does not seem to have gone beyond the getting out of some legs. There is some material at Prince Albert waiting to go in. No funds have been requested in the main estimates. I should say that it would take at least $10,000.00 to erect any sort of suitable building at Lac La Ronge.\n\nE. L. Stone, M.D.,\nDirector of Medical Services.\nWinnipeg, Man., November 28, 1930\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of November 6th, in which you desire to be informed if the list of materials required for improvements at our Lac la Ronge School could be shipped in March next so that the accounts would reach your Department not earlier than the 15th. of April, I beg to state that as the winter trail from Prince Albert to Lac la Ronge is somewhat uncertain during the latter part of March, our Commission consider that it would be a mistake to defer shipment of any material to so late a date. They instructed me, however, to inform you that if your Department will undertake to meet this expenditure, including the freight, they will place the orders early next year, and arrange for the bills to be forwarded to you at the time you have indicated.\n\nI may also state for your information, that I wrote to the Principal of our Lac la Ronge School on November 12th, requesting him to furnish me with a recommendation with regard to the type of kitchen range and hot water tank with heater required, but up to date have not received his reply. As soon as this has been received, I will write to you again. In the meantime, I shall be glad to have an authorization from you to purchase the materials and to submit the bills in April of next year. All supplies for this school for next year will be ordered by our Commission in December, in order that they may leave Prince Albert during the month of January.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, December 5, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to improvements at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. You may order the equipment listed in my letter of the 6th ultimo, at an estimated cost of $525.00 and arrange shipment to the school. It is understood that the accounts in this connection will reach the Department not earlier than April 15. When you have information regarding the kitchen range and hot water tank which are desired, please write the Department giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nThe painting materials may be purchased from The Northern Paint Company, G. F. Stevens and Company, or the Winnipeg Paint and Glass Company; and the beds and mattresses from either the Parkhill Bedding Company or the Simmons Bedding Company.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg,\nManitoba.\nWINNIPEG, MAN. December 24, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letters of Nov. 6 and Dec. 5 (No. 132-2-5) and my reply to the former on Nov. 28th., relative to the improvements required at our Lac la Ronge School, I beg to state that the information you requested with regard to the Kitchen Range and Hot Water Tank and Heater, has just come to hand from the Principal.\n\nWith regard to the Range, he suggests that the \"McClary Famous Hotel Range\" would be the most suitable as it is of the double range type.\n\nWith regard to the Hot Water Tank the Principal writes as follows:\n\n\"The only thing I can do as regards the hot water tank is to give you the space into which it must fit. If it is an upright tank, including heater it must not be higher than 7' 6\". If a horizontal tank, not longer than 6' 6\". The tank could be heated from the central furnace of the school by the insertion of a water jacket, which should be 4' X 12\". Of course it would be better to have a dual system of heating - one attachment to the furnace for use during the winter months and the other for use when the furnaces are not used. If a heater to burn cord wood could be obtained that would be best, but whatever kind of heater it is, it should burn wood not less than 30 ins long. In the case of a horizontal tank, that is provided it would not damage the tank itself, a fire-box could be built under it, if the necessary fire-brick and clay were sent in.\"\n\"The following will be required for installation in any case.\n\n25 ft. of 3/4 inc. galvanized pipe\n25 ft. of 1 in \" \"\n25 ft. of 1/2 in \" \"\n2 check valves 3/4 in.\n2 \" \" in.\n1 Globe valve 3/4 in.\n1 \" \" in.\n6 Elbows \" in.\n3 \" 45 deg. \" in.\n6 \" \" in.\n3 \" 45 deg. \" in.\n1 Bushing 1 1/2 to 3 in.\n2 3/4 in. Bushings to whatever size connection on tank.\n2 3/4 in.\n\nDepending on the kind of heater.\n\n1 Hot Water Jacket 4' X 12\"\n1 Furnace Door.\n\nIn addition to the above the Principal requests that 90 yards of battleship linoleum be supplied for the upstairs corridors in the main school building.\n\nHe further requests a new bake oven to fit into a space 4' x 3' but gives no fuller details of this requirement.\n\nAs these requirements should be ordered in time to go forward before the winter trail closes, I shall be obliged if you will have the same forwarded to the following address:\n\nRev. G. W. Fisher,\nAnglican Indian School,\nLac la Ronge,\nc/o Revi\u00e9don Freres,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nAn order is being placed by our Commission for the materials mentioned in your letter of Nov. 6th., and arrangements are being made for the bills for the same, including freight, to be forwarded to your Department about the middle of April next.\"\nWith the compliments of the season,\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.O.C.\nOttawa, December 30, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, with reference to the request of the Principal of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School to be supplied with a kitchen range, hot water tank, with water jacket, and equipment for installing same.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase, from Marshall-Wells Co. Ltd., Winnipeg, of a range of the type required; also a hot water tank, with water jacket, and the necessary piping, etc., for installing same. You should have same forwarded in time to reach Prince Albert before the winter trail to the school closes. Accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost of the above equipment, certified in the usual manner, should be forwarded, but, if possible, should reach the Department not earlier than April 15th, next.\n\nRelative to the request of the Principal to be supplied with battleship linoleum and a bake oven, I have to say that the Department has no funds to provide the cost of this equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I understand that this is not in working condition but as this would be useful to me for purposes of repairing another plant I would consider the purchase of it, providing the price is sufficiently low to warrant my putting it to the use mentioned above.\n\nShould you be willing to dispose of the plant advise me as to the freight rate to Prince Albert. An early reply will oblige.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd) H. L. Thompson.\n\nH. L. Thompson.\nWinnipeg, Man. March 10, 1931\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith you will find a copy of a letter from Mr. H. L. Thompson of Cranberry Portage, Man., addressed to the Principal of our Lac la Ronge School with regard to the purchase of the old Delco Lighting Plant now lying idle at this school. When forwarding this letter to me the Principal wrote, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Enclosed you will find a letter from Mr. H. L. Thompson. The old Delco Plant is still here, but is to some extent dismantled. I have no idea as to its original cost, so have no idea what it is worth. Mr. Hastings says that the engine and dynamo are complete, save that the crank case is broken. Will you kindly write Mr. Thompson making him an offer? I was talking to Mr. Middlebrooks the other day, and he would be willing to take it out in March for $2.80 per cwt., but would not guarantee to do it for that at a later date. Bear's rate would be $3.00. The plant will never be of any value to us in its present condition. Will you kindly notify me as soon as you been regarding this matter.\"\n\nI shall be obliged if you will let me know at your earliest convenience if we may dispose of this plant, and the use to which the proceeds, if a sale is effected, may be applied.\n\nIn his covering letter, the Principal directs attention to the need of a wood shed in which to store wood for use in the kitchen range and also to the need of eleven blinds for his own residence. He states that the school...\nmanagement could build the wood shed with some local help at a cost of about $60.00 if our Commission supplied the roofing and nails. The total cost of the wood shed and the blinds would probably amount to $150.00, and I shall be obliged if you will let me know (1) if an expenditure of this amount may be met from the sale of the Delco Plant, if effected, or (2) if your Department will authorize the same from your Departmental appropriation.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, March 16, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the old lighting equipment at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School and the need of a woodshed and blinds for the Principal's residence. The Department cannot give a decision in this connection until we know what Mr. Thompson will give for the old Delce.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

Wpg., for about one hundred dollars and therefore the most that I feel justified in offering for the Lac la Ronge outfit, in view of its condition and location is thirty dollars, especially as I consider it suitable only for dismantling for repair parts.\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd) H.

L. Thompson of Cranberry Portage, Man., who states that he will buy the same for $30.00. When I asked Mr. Thompson to state the price he would be willing to pay for this old plant, I quoted the original cost of the same as given on page 58 of the Auditor-General's Report for 1921-22, and this will explain his reference to that Report in the opening paragraph of his letter. In view of the information given by Mr. Thompson, I beg to recommend that his offer be accepted, and that I be notified of your decision in the matter, by wire, as the plant must be brought out before the end of March.\n\nAs the $30.00 received from this source will not meet the cost of the wood shed and blinds referred to in my letter of March 10th, I shall be obliged if you will (1) authorize our Commission to apply this amount towards the cost of these items, and (2) an additional sum not exceeding $120.00 to cover the balance of the same.\n\nA prompt reply will oblige\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/W\nOTTAWA, March 24, 1931.\n\nREV.

A.\nOttawa, March 24, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with reference to the disposal of the old Delco lighting plant at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School and enclosing copy of a communication which you received from Mr. H. L. Thompson, who wishes to buy this equipment. In this connection I have to confirm the following telegram to you of today's date:-\n\n\"May apply old Delco proceeds towards cost woodshed, Lac la Ronge.\"\n\nThe proceeds, $30.00, received for the sale of the old lighting plant, may be applied towards the cost of material for the erection of the woodshed and for blinds for the Principal's residence. It is regretted that the Department will have no funds available to provide for the erection of the woodshed and the supplying of the blinds, in excess of the amount received from the sale of the lighting plant. It will not be necessary to make any accounting for this amount, which should be applied, by the Principal, towards the cost of the woodshed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Jean,\n\nYour letter May 1st received, and we are sorry that we overlooked to include freight amounting to $21.15 in invoice #55 of January 29th, 1931, amounting to $196.50. This freight was prepaid, and as suggested, we are forwarding an invoice in duplicate and thank you for refunding this amount to us at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSIMMONS LIMITED,\nPrairie Division.\n\nCredit Manager.\nSir:-\n\nI have just received a letter from Inspector W. Morrison, from Lac la Ronge, and append an excerpt in regard to the Residential School there, Mr. Morrison writes in part as follows:\n\nI would like to draw your attention to two things which should be arranged for before the cold weather arrives.\n\nThe school is heated with three hot air furnaces and the firebox in one of these is so badly burnt out as to be unsafe to start a fire in. The furnace pipes from two of the furnaces are 18 ft. in length and either galvanized iron or asbestos paper should be provided as a measure of protection in the event of the pipes getting on fire inside. The furnaces are No. 419a McClary wood burning 60\" long (firebox).\n\nThe batteries in connection with the Fairbank-Morse lighting plant are used up and will have to be replaced at once if they are to have light this winter. The switchboard is out of repair and appears to be an obsolete type as they have not been able to get repairs for it. It is Type B.I., 40 volts, 100 amps., No. 4937, made by the Hartman Electric Mfg. Co., Mansfield, Ohio. When the current is turned on fire flies out of the automatic switch close to the base. I think that a complete new automatic switch might solve the trouble and a new switchboard might not be necessary. The Fairbank-Morse people should know.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nI called up\nI called up the Fairbank-Horse Company here this morning, and the particulars given are not sufficient to enable them to intimate what is required. However, they will get in touch with their Winnipeg office and give me a price, if possible, on the batteries required, though it is possible that they did not install them.\n\nThe Department arranged for the furnishings of this building when it was erected, and if it desires me to make replacements, it should give me the information available on the files. Both matters should, of course, be attended to promptly so that the necessary repairs may be effected before the cold weather sets in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, July 29, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 307-11A G.E. of the 24th instant, with reference to a new firebox for one of the hot air furnaces at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. You may make arrangements to replace the firebox.\n\nIn connection with the electric lighting plant, you may purchase a suitable battery, after securing prices from the firms listed in my 117-3-6 of the 13th instant and, in addition, the firm given to you in the Deputy Superintendent General's telegram of the 17th instant. The last batteries supplied were purchased in November, 1927, from Lemery-Denison Electric, Limited, of Saskatoon. The account reads: - 32 cells KKH - 15 Batteries - $406.80 f. o. b. Prince Albert.\n\nWith reference to the new switch board which is required, you may make purchase from one of these firms, after determining just what is required. Our files show that the switch board needed replacement in 1926, but the School made purchase from their per capita or other earnings. Therefore, there is no detail on our files regarding just what kind of board was installed. I may say, however, that the Fairbanks-Morse Company, of Winnipeg, supplied the following equipment for the electric lighting plant in October, 1925: -\n\nOne 10 H P Type Z Engine with cooling tank, pulley and special box of fittings. It was equipped with a AB 34 Bosch magneto.\n\nOne 5\u00bd K W Generator, 1750 RPM 32 40 Belt DC. The number given is X37499.\n\nIt may be that this information will assist you in determining what type of switch board is required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. M.

August 27, 1931\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring the latter part of July and the beginning of August, I visited our Society's Indian Residential School at Lac la Ronge, Sask., and reported the following requirements to our Commission:\n\n(1) New batteries, 48 Exide, and new switch board for the lighting plant,\n(2) New bread oven,\n(3) Metal lining and flooring for the store-room,\n(4) Lumber lining for the grain and feed room,\n(5) One enamel bath and two toilet bowls with fittings complete,\n(6) Wire netting for the upper verandah of the main school building, and also for the verandah at the Principal's residence,\n(7) 4 dog bedsteads and 2 dozen mattresses,\n(8) 3\" valve for Globe washing machine, No. of valve 1215\u00bd for machine M7185\n(9) 1000 shingles for repairs to roofs,\n(10) Increase in the school land from 75 acres, this being the amount attached to the school at present, to at least 640 acres,\n(11) Clearing of more land, say 25 acres so that hay and green feed may be grown for the stock,\n(12) A supply of creosote or paint for roofs, paint and asbestos for outer and inner walls of buildings, especially the main school building.\n\nAs I was informed by the Principal that Mr. Inspector Murison, who accompanied the Treaty party this year, had given careful consideration to most of the above requirements, and undertook to recommend to your Department...\nthat they be supplied, I do not consider it necessary to do more than to state that when I reported these requirements to our Commission, I was instructed to forward the list to you and ask you to kindly endeavour to provide the same.\n\nThe storage batteries and switch board should be sent in as soon as the winter trail opens next December. These items should have priority of claim over all the others. The other items are arranged in the order of the urgency of their requirement.\n\nWith regard to the clearing of more land, our Commission instructed me to make known to your Department the serious problem they have to face from year to year in securing an adequate supply of hay for the stock. The school management now go from island to island in the lake cutting a little here and there, whenever it is to be found. They are experimenting with oats on a small piece of ground, and from results obtained, feel confident that the hay and green feed problem can be solved if more land is cleared. Your Department made a grant for this purpose a few years ago, and the money was well spent in clearing about five acres of land near the main school building. A great many stones, however, will have to be removed before this area can be seeded to advantage. The bush fire of 1927 which destroyed the forest around the school and endangered the school buildings at the same time, revealed considerably land about a mile or two behind the school, which could be brought under cultivation if properly cleared of stumps and shrubbery, and as this would afford employment for the Indians in the settlement, our Commission strongly recommend that not less than 25 acres be cleared as soon as possible. As this area does not at present lie within the boundaries of the school property, our Commission feel that steps should be taken to have the school land increased sufficiently to enclose it, and they trust that your Department may be able to help them in the way indicated.\n\nDuring my visit, which is the third I have made to this school, I received the impression, based on very careful observation, that this is a work fully worthy of your Department and of our Society, which is being accomplished\nat this remote centre, and it would be an encouragement to the school management if arrangements can be made to supply the essentials required to expand and consolidate this work.\n\nTrusting that all the items listed may receive your sympathetic consideration, and some means found to provide the same when the winter trail opens next December.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nTBRW/W\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, September 8, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to requirements at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. I may say that a new battery has already been purchased for this school and we are giving attention to the matter of a switch board. As far as the bread oven and other repairs and replacements are concerned, there are no funds at the present time, but I am making a note for next year's Estimates. You will receive an additional letter with reference to the school land.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.

It is nicely situated, facing the lake. It is under the auspices of the Church of England, with the Reverend G. W. Fisher as Principal.\n\nThe male members of the staff include an engineer, farmer and fisherman. The female members comprise a Matron, Miss E. V. Williams, two teachers, a Girls' Supervisor, Boys' Supervisor, Laundress, Kitchen Matron and a Graduate Nurse.\n\nI spent four\nI spent four days at this school, and was greatly pleased with the general atmosphere. The staff impressed me as being capable and interested in their work, and appear to get along well together. The teachers have both had normal training in Saskatchewan.\n\nI found the school building clean and tidy throughout. The pupils presented a clean and healthy appearance. I am attaching a snapshot which I took of the girls, to this report, and you will see that they are a good appearing lot of children.\n\nI visited both class-rooms and had an examination in each. The pupils spoke up well in the senior class-room, but the teacher in the junior class-room informed me that she had great difficulty, even when alone, to get the junior pupils to speak above a whisper. I talked to the pupils of both class-rooms, pointing out the value of obtaining a thorough knowledge of English, as well as a training in domestic work. I was present each day during meal hours, and noted that the meals comprised plenty of good wholesome food, including meat, fish, vegetables and preserved fruit. Fish comprises a staple food for these people, and the children, I am informed, never appear to get tired of it. Most excellent whitefish is obtained from Lac la Ronge, and the fisherman keeps them supplied daily with fresh fish. The meat diet is varied with moose meat, which is not...\nmeat, which is not difficult to obtain at this point.\n\nThey have a large and well-kept garden, which provides an ample supply of potatoes, roots and vegetables for the use of the institution. The school stands on rocky ground, and I was very much interested in learning that the soil for the garden was brought in by canoe, a good many years ago. You will note from one of the snap-shots that I am enclosing that the outside of the garden fence is solid rock, while the garden itself has a good appearance.\n\nOwing to the difficulty of obtaining feed for stock, only four cows, one bull and two horses are kept. Therefore it is impossible to supply the children with any quantity of milk for drinking purposes. The hay supply has to be purchased and brought across the lake for about fifteen miles. It costs the Principal $300.00 to provide hay for the seven head on hand during the past winter.\n\nThe land which was set aside for this school is all rock and muskeg. I went into this matter very closely and was informed that there was some land about one-half mile north of the school where a sufficient acreage could be cleared to enable them to grow their own feed for stock. I walked over this land in company with the engineer and found that his statement was correct. It would be quite possible to obtain the clearing of 25 or 30 acres, which would meet the requirements. In order to provide this, another quarter or half-section might be set aside for the use of the school. The land I speak of, I am satisfied will never be taken up by settlers.\nup by settlers, as owing to the fact that it is surrounded by rocky land and muskeg, and has no lake frontage, it is practically valueless as it stands. I was informed that this land could be cleared with the help of the big boys at a cost of about $20.00 per acre. They have already cleared about three acres of this, but the Principal does not feel that he would be justified in spending any considerable amount until they have a proprietary right to the land. Unless some such arrangement is made, it would be impossible to increase the number of cows.\n\nMain Building,\n\nThe main building, which is a frame structure on a stone foundation, is 65 feet X 105 feet. It comprises a basement, first and second floors, and an attic. It is heated with three hot air furnaces. I noted that one furnace fire-box is burnt out and should be replaced at once, as it is unsafe. The furnaces have been in use since the school was first built. The furnace pipes from two of the furnaces are 18 feet in length, and in the event of a fire starting in these pipes, there would be a great danger of the building catching on fire, as they are unprotected, and in order to make them safe, either galvanized iron or asbestos paper should be placed on the joists, above the pipes, as a measure of protection.\n\nThe ground floor provides two class-rooms, two play-rooms, as well as the office, staff sitting-room, bathroom and staff rooms. On the first floor there are two dormitories, each 56 feet X 26 feet, with a 12-foot ceiling. These dormitories are placed at each end of the building to give separation, are provided with bathrooms.\nwith two bathrooms, with two tubs, four basins and one toilet in each. The attic is used for storage purposes.\n\nFire protection is provided by a stand-pipe, with hose connections on each floor. There is an ample supply of pyrex and chemical extinguishers on each floor and in the basement. In the centre portion of the building there is a wide verandah, with a balcony above it. There is access to this balcony from the attic, and from the dormitories by means of four pole fire escapes, which continue on down to the floor of the verandah. There is also a stairway at the rear of the building, with access to it from the sewing-room which is used as a fire escape as well. The pupils are given occasional fire-drill. Each member of the staff has his given station, and understands his duties.\n\nThere are two chimneys in the building, and I noted that one had been cracked by fire, and should be re-faced with cement.\n\nAn addition at the rear of the building provides a kitchen, laundry and engine-room. The laundry equipment provides a large sized power washing-machine, extractor, mangle, two set tubs and three stoves. One of these stoves is equipped with a coil, and attached to a hot-water tank.\n\nUpstairs over this division is situated a drying-room and an extra sewing room. I have already reported on the condition of the electrical plant, and the repairs required, are being sent forward.\n\nWhile I found the school clean throughout, I may say that it has not been re-decorated for a long time, and the interior walls require re-decorating badly.\n\nThe water supply is obtained from the lake, and their pumping\nand their pumping equipment is giving good satisfaction.\n\nThe outer buildings are adequate for the present requirements. The principal resides in a separate building, which is a neat and comfortable house.\n\nThere were 39 boys and 35 girls present on the date of my visit, which was the last day the school was open before the summer holidays.\n\nThere is one point which was brought to my attention here, and one I have mentioned in my general report: The fisherman who is employed by the school states that it is becoming increasingly difficult to catch sufficient fish for their requirements with a 5-inch mesh net, which is the mesh of net called for by the Regulations, and he further stated that if the size of the mesh were not reduced to 4\u00bd inches, the Indians and the school would find it very difficult to obtain an adequate amount of fish. To use his own words, he said that the Indians would starve. As the Indians and the school officers catch fish for food only, and not for commercial purposes, it appears to me only reasonable that they should be permitted to use a net with which it is possible to catch fish, and I would suggest that the Department take this matter up very strongly with the Fisheries authorities.\n\nAnother point which was brought to my attention was: The principal of the school is required to obtain a permit, which costs him $15.00 per year, notwithstanding the fact that this is an Indian School, and the fish is being used to feed Indian children. Therefore, would it not be advisable to take the matter of granting a free\nof granting a free license for this purpose.\n\nOwing to this school being so remote from the railway, the matter of transporting their supplies from outside is an expensive one, particularly in the summer time. I am informed that the freight rate in the summer is 7\u00a2 and in the winter 3\u00a2 per cwt. This work has, in the past, been given to Indians, as far as possible. When they have to use the regular transportation companies from Prince Albert during the summer, they are called upon to pay 5\u00a2 per cwt. There is a radio station about one-half mile from the school, from which it is possible to send out messages. The Post Office is about one-quarter mile distant, and the Hudson's Bay Company, Revillon Freres and an independent trader have stores in close proximity to the school.\n\nThere is a point that the Principal brought up with regard to the balcony being floored and ceiled, and he wishes to convert the extra sewing room in the back wing, into staff rooms. He can do this work with the aid of the staff, and has lumber and other material on hand, so that it will not be necessary to incur any expense in this connection, but he does not like to use this material without first getting authority from the Department to do so. I believe that the material in question was shipped in with the object in mind of making some addition to the school, which has since been thought inadvisable.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nWith regard to the Lac La Ronge School, it will be noted that the situation of this school is not by any means as favourable as that at Beauval, there being very little land under cultivation, or fit for that purpose. The Inspector points out that some might be obtained if the Department could arrange for the purchasing of same, or for having it set aside. I do not know how this affects the arrangements made with the Provincial Government re setting land aside for the Indians, but would suggest that it be set aside as an Indian reserve, and the school then allowed to use it. I would be glad to be advised in this connection, and I will then take the matter up with the proper authorities here. We should certainly provide for the growing of hay for feed for the cattle, so that the children could obtain milk as part of their diet.\n\nThe Inspector gives a description of the building in his report. The furnaces that are out of order should be repaired with the least possible delay, and either the Department should provide for this work, or they should see that the school authorities have it done, as a fire at this point would be a very serious matter. The chimney should also be repaired.\n\nI will take the matter of reducing the size of the mesh of nets from 5 to 4\u00bd inches up with the Fisheries Branch, as, in any event, it will have to be dealt with here in Regina.\n\nWith regard to the suggestion that the balcony be floored and ceiled with the material on hand, and with the help of the school staff, I would be glad to have your instructions in this matter. I would say that I think we should act on the suggestions of the Principal, in this connection.\n\nW. M. Graham.\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, October 26, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nMr. Inspector Murison's report on the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School has reached the Department. If you have not already taken the necessary action, will you please replace the furnace firebox, which is now burnt out, and protect the joists above the smoke pipe from both furnaces with either galvanized iron or asbestos paper. Properly certified accounts, in duplicate, should be forwarded to the Department for the materials in this connection. Will you please arrange to have the chimney which is cracked refaced with cement without delay. You are also authorized to use materials which are on hand to floor and ceil the balcony and to convert the extra sewing room into staff rooms. It is understood that the school authorities will be responsible for the labour in this connection and that there will be no expense for the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. G. W. Fisher,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nLac la Ronge, Sask.\nOttawa, October 26, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your 307-11 of the 8th instant, enclosing Mr. Murison's report on the schools in the Ile a la Crosse agency. The Department is pleased to note the progress at the Beauval Indian Residential School. There is an understanding with the church authorities in this connection.\n\nWith reference to the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School, I am writing direct to the Rev. Principal, instructing him to have one furnace firebox replaced at once; to cover the smoke pipes on both furnaces; to repair the cracked chimney and authorizing him to use materials on hand to convert the extra sewing room in the back wing into staff rooms. I note that you will look into the school's requests with reference to fishing. You will receive a further letter concerning the land at the Lac La Ronge institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe - Wood burning jacket heater for\nLac la Ronge School, C. of E.\n\nIn your letter of December 5th, 1930, 132-2-5,\n(see also your letter November 6th, 1930, 132-2-5) you\nauthorized the installation of a hot water tank at our Lac\nla Ronge Indian Residential School. In my letter to you on\nDecember 24th, 1930, I quoted an extract from a letter received\nfrom Mr. Principal Fisher, in which he stated, with regard to\nthe heating of this tank, that \"it would be better to have\na dual system of heating - one attachment to the furnace for\nuse during the months of winter, and the other for use when\nthe furnaces are not used. If a heater to burn wood could\nbe obtained, that would be best, but whatever kind of heater\nit is, it should burn wood not less than 30\" long\".\n\nThe hot water tank authorized was installed, and\narrangements made for the same to be connected with the\ncentral furnace. In a letter recently received from Mr.\nPrincipal Fisher, and dated October 15th., he writes, in part,\nas follows, with regard to this matter:-\n\n\"I am sorry to say, from the heating standpoint, the\nhot water tank is not a success. When Mr. Inspector\nMurison was here he suggested sending a jacket heater\nto attach to this tank, but from what I have heard of\njacket heaters, they will take only small pieces of\nwood. I recommend that instead of a jacket heater, a\nlarge-sized box stove that would burn wood 3' long,\nbe supplied. I am afraid we will never have real\nheat water until we have additional means of heating.\nThe firm who supplied the tank would be able to\nadvise you with regard to the best kind of heater to\nsecure.\"\nOn receipt of the above letter I took the matter up at once with the Marshall-Wells Company, Ltd., the firm that supplied the tank, and they furnished me with the following information and the enclosed blue print drawing of the heater they recommended. Their letter reads as follows:\n\n\"We are pleased to quote you a price of $333.00 f.o.b. Winnipeg, sales tax included, for one only wood burning jacketed Hot Water Heater, having Furnace thirty inches in diameter by five foot length, equipped for burning cord wood, as per blue print attached No. P.943, to connect up to large tank supplied you some time ago. You will note that the inlet is two inches and the outlet for the hot water is two and one-half inches. The smoke collar is ten inches in diameter. The weight of this Boiler is 2660 pounds.\n\nTrusting our quotation will meet with your approval, and hoping to receive your valued order.\"\n\nYou will note that the price of $333.00 for the heater recommended is f.o.b. Winnipeg only. As the weight is given at 2660 lbs., the freight charges from Prince Albert to Lac la Ronge would amount to, at 3\u00a2 a lb., $79.80. To this would have to be added transportation charges from Winnipeg to Prince Albert, and handling charges there. To cover the total cost of transportation charges from Winnipeg to Lac la Ronge, the sum of $433.00 would be required, and possibly a little more.\n\nAs the heater is very urgently needed, and as I gather from letters recently received from your Department, that your appropriation for the current fiscal year is limited, I shall be obliged if you will inform me, if your Department will refund to our Society at the beginning of the fiscal year 1932-33, the total cost of purchasing and delivering this heater, with the necessary connections, if we place an order at once, and pay the bills, should the Marshall-Wells Co., ask for payment in the meantime. This suggestion is offered in view of the urgency of the need, and in order that the shipment may go forward as soon as the winter trail is open. A prompt reply will oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6316, file 656-5, part 5)\nOttawa, November 6, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, relative to the supplying of a wood burning jacketed hot water heater for the Lac la Rouge Indian Residential School. In this connection it is noted that the hot water tank which was installed is not a success and that the jacket heater is badly needed.\n\nYou may place an order for the supplying of one only wood burning jacketed heater, of the type as mentioned in the quotation which you received from Marshall-Wells Company, Limited. The price should not exceed the quotation which you received, viz.: $335.00 f. o. b. Winnipeg, sales tax included. You should arrange to have the heater forwarded to the school.\n\nThe Department will pay the cost of supplying this heater, together with the freight charges thereon, from Winnipeg to the school. Please obtain an account, in duplicate, from the firm from which you make the purchase, as well as receipts for freight charges from Winnipeg to Prince Albert. These accounts, you should certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department, when payment will be made. The amount of the freight charges from Prince Albert to the school has been noted, and this will be paid upon receipt of the account, in duplicate, properly certified.\n\nFunds for the above purpose can be found in this year's appropriation, and I would request, therefore, that the accounts be forwarded soon after the purchase has been made.\n\nThe blue print drawing of the heater recommended to be supplied, which you enclosed in your letter, is returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nRegina, Sask., 2nd Sept. 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Murison,\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the schools which I inspected during the time I was Paying Officer for the Ile a la Crosse Agency.\n\nLAC LA RONDE CHURCH OF ENGLAND RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nI arrived at this school on the night of July 8th, remaining here until leaving for Stanley on July 12th.\n\nOwing to the school being closed for the summer vacation and rainy weather, the Reverend Mr. Fisher, Principal allowed me the use of one of the classrooms for the purpose of making annuity payments and holding band meetings.\n\nI found the Reverend Mr. Fisher conscientious and keen in his service to this institution. This was reflected in the general atmosphere of keen co-operation apparent between this man and his staff, which included Miss E.V. Williams, Matron; F.E. Simmon, 1st teacher; Mr. Crozier, 2nd teacher; C. Pinney, Girls' Supervisor; B. Baird, Boys' Supervisor; E. Smith, Kitchen Matron; D. Mathews, Laundress; N.L. Patrick, Nurse; A.C. Hastings Engineer; T.A. Mills, Farmer; and C.C. Brown, Fisherman.\n\nOwing to the school being closed as already mentioned, I did not examine the class work of the pupils. However, during the payment here and at Stanley I came in contact with many of them. In addressing these I found them well mannered, clean, tidy, neatly dressed and apparently well nourished, and I found they would join in conversation more readily than many Indian pupils I have met. They expressed a keen interest in their school work and seemed very loyal to the institution.\n\nI found the school and other buildings pertaining thereto clean and tidy within and the grounds without very nicely kept.\n\nThe Reverend Principal informed me there were about 2000' of lumber left over after using that authorized by the department. This surplus is being used to good advantage, mainly in building partitions in the upper dormitory for the girls, which will accommodate two full beds and a staff room. Partitions are also being built to separate the smaller boys from the larger, and any surplus lumber left will be used for general repairs to buildings. The floors and ceilings of the upper balconies were not completed. I was advised they will be this fall. The Principal requested that wire screening 6' x 65' be provided for this. It could then be used for isolation cases during the summer months.\n\nI found the chimney of this building has been repaired, but does not draw well at times, resulting in soot overflowing and running down it; and on these occasions the building becomes smoky and the inside walls thereof are stained. I also noticed the basement joists have been protected with asbestos from the heat of the furnace pipes also a new fire box installed in one of the furnaces. In checking over the fire protection equipment I find further protection can be given by supplying a 50' x 5/8' garden hose and placing it in the upper dormitory to be used in case of chimney fires, also that recharges are necessary for the following fire extinguishers, 24 recharges Guardene Fire Ext. No. A. 606201 capacity 2\u00bd gals., 12 recharges for Pyrene No. P 204697 1 quart type.\nThe interior of the school building should be redecorated in that many of the walls are stained, and paint worn off some of the floors and part of the wood-work. I also noticed moss growing between the crevices of the shingles on the roof which should be stained or repainted.\n\nMy attention was also drawn to the fact that some of the dormitory beds need replacing badly, whereas a little enamel paint would improve the appearance of others.\n\nThe farm stock consists of 4 milk cows, a team of horses, and 36 hens. These are not adequate to supply the general demand made on them. I find the nature of the land here is not adaptable for cultivation and the Principal informs me that it is only with some effort on the part of this institution that enables them to maintain what little stock they have. In this I concur.\n\nIn going over the land I was forcibly impressed with the fact that this institution will never support its staff and members by any produce derived therefrom, regardless of the amount of labour expended in any attempt to do so. While here, I was questioned concerning a further grant of land to them.\n\nApart from the requirements already mentioned, I find this school require the following:\n\n- New Rear Start for Fairbanks Morse 52 volt Lighting Plant.\n- 2 toilet bowls with flush tanks (as replacements)\n- 1 wash basin with fittings (as there is only 1 toilet room for staff in this building)\n- 2 doz. beds and mattresses 6 x 2\u00bd for replacements\n- 1000 shingles for repairing roof.\n- 50 gals roof paint - green or creosot\n- 1\u00bd gal white enamel paint for bedsteads\n- 15 gal floor paint - grey for dormitory floors.\n- 3 gals turpentine.\n- 5 lbs dry burnt umber.\n- 7 gals. floor varnish for halls and dining room.\n- 3 furnace door linings for McClary's Farnour Magnet Furnace No.H19A.\n\nIn view of the effort involved by this institution in an endeavour to carry on the good and only work of its kind in this section of the North, I would respectfully request they be given special consideration in grants the department may be considering for these institutions.\n\nS. M. Simpson.\nPaying Officer.\nRegina, Sask., 22nd, September 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward a report on the schools included in the Isle a la Crosse agency submitted by the Paying Officer for this year, Mr. S.H. Simpson.\n\nLAC LA RONGE RES. SCHOOL.\n\nThis report gives a general idea of conditions and sets out in detail the requirements as presented to him. You will note (on page 7) he mentions that he was questioned regarding a further grant of land to them. I took this matter up quite fully last year, looked over the ground, and made a recommendation regarding land which might be set aside. This is a matter which I think should receive some attention before it is too late to secure suitable land. There is very little fit for cultivation in that whole area and it is important, if this school is to be continued, that sufficient arable land be secured upon which to grow the feed requirements of the stock belonging to the institution.\n\nW. Murison.\nInspector.\nOttawa, October 7, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to the report of Mr. S. H. Simpson, paying officer for the Isle a la Crosse Agency, on his inspection of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School, forwarded under cover of your No. 307-11 of the 22nd ultimo, I have to say regarding the requirements recommended by the paying officer, that certain funds are available for materials and equipment at this school, and I shall be pleased if you will furnish an estimate of the cost of supplying the following:\n\nNew rear start for Fairbanks-Morse 32-volt lighting plant,\n2 Toilet bowls, with flush tanks,\n1 Wash basin, with fittings,\n1,000 Shingles, for repairing roof,\n50 Gals. roof paints,\n14 Gals. white enamel,\nGals. turpentine,\n15 Gals. floor paint,\n5 Lbs. dry burnt umber,\n7 Gals. floor varnish,\n3 Furnace door linings for McClary's Famous Magnet Furnace No. H19A.\n\nPlease state, if authority is granted, if you could arrange for the purchase and forwarding of these supplies. It is considered that this equipment could be forwarded to Prince Albert and from there freighted to the school during the coming winter.\n\nWhen we have information as to the cost involved, consideration will be given to authorizing you to make the purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

G. W. Fisher, Principal of our Society's School at Lac la Ronge, Sask., has directed the attention of our Commission to the urgent need of a brick chimney for the main school building, and I am writing for the specific purpose of asking your Department to authorize the expenditure involved in providing the same. When this school was built, it was built at a comparatively small cost to your Department, as practically all the lumber and timber required for the same was cut and dressed in the school saw-mill. The iron Hudson's Bay chimneys which were installed, however, have never been satisfactory. Wood is used as fuel, and the school management have had great difficulty in keeping them free from creosote, which chokes them up, with the result that the building is filled with smoke whenever the fires are being made up. There is also a constant danger that the creosote encrustation will itself catch fire, and, in turn, set fire to the roof or some other part of the building.\n\nOur Commission have secured from experts in Winnipeg the following information with regard to the materials and cost of building a 56' chimney which would have 3 flues, all of which are necessary, because of the number of furnaces in use, in addition to the hot water heater and the kitchen stove. The bricks and other materials mentioned make provision for a chimney with 9\" walls, other than the parts between the flues, and the flues themselves are to be 13\" x 13\" square. The inside of each flue is to be coated with cement plaster and flue lining. The Principal submitted the sketch of the chimney of the three flues, and you will notice that he indicates the flues which are to be 9\" square. Our expert declares that 9\" flues are much too small, being smaller than those used for...\ndwelling houses in the City, and he recommends that the flues should each be 13\" square. The list of materials he made out, and which is given below, was based on 9\" flues. If 13\" flues are made, and I recommend that this be done, there will be an additional cost for materials amounting to $87.75. This is the list:\n\n3600 Bricks (Snyder) .................. $67.35\n133 Fire Bricks (St. Louis) .......... 14.65\n10 lb. Fire Clay ...................... .30\n58 Bags of Lime - 100 lbs. .......... 54.25\n30 Bags Cement ....................... 25.40\n150 Lin. ft. Flue lining 8\u00bd\"x8\u00bd\" ..... 90.75\n3 - 9\" Thimbles ....................... .85\n3 - Clean out doors with frames .... 2.65\n16 Lin. ft. Galv. Iron 12\" flashing ... 1.95\n\nFreight charges to Prince Albert ...... 108.00\n(26160 lbs. 10th. class 36\u00a2 rate)\n\nThe total cost for materials delivered at Prince Albert would be $423.90. To this must be added say $900.00 for freight from Prince Albert to Lac la Ronge.\n\nWith regard to the cost of building, the Principal states that there is a competent brick-layer at Lac la Ronge, who, with the assistance of four laborers would build the chimney for $250.00. This would bring the total cost of building the chimney up to $1,873.90, and I shall be glad to have your authorization to have the work undertaken at once. The freighting season is getting shorter, and there is very little time to order the materials and have them put through before the break-up. The amount, at first sight, may appear to be quite large, but to my mind it is better to provide this school with the comfort and safety which the chimney will afford, rather than run the risk of losing the whole school building and of endangering the lives of staff agents and pupils. An authorization by telegram to have the work undertaken at once will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Our Estimates for the next fiscal year, 1933-34, have been severely cut, and, in the case of the Lac la Ronge School, no provision is made for any repairs or equipment. Therefore, it will not be possible to authorize the expenditure required in the erection of a brick chimney.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.

You may arrange purchase forwarding itemized accounts in triplicate with receipts for freight charges which must reach Department before end present month.\"\n\nIt is noted from your letter of the 3rd ultimo, giving a detailed estimate of the material, that the cost, including freight to Prince Albert, in the erection of a chimney with three flues, each 13 square, would be $425.90. You should make early arrangements for the purchase of the materials and for the forwarding of same to Prince Albert.\n\nPlease obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, together with receipts for freight charges to Prince Albert. These you should certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department before the end of the present month, in order that payment can be made from our appropriation for the present fiscal year. Our books for the present fiscal year will close at the end of the current month. We have certain funds available this year. If the accounts are received later than the time mentioned it would be very difficult to provide the funds from our Appropriation for the coming fiscal year, owing to the fact that same has been considerably reduced.\n\nIt is noted from your letter that a 56' chimney will be erected and that three flues will be necessary. It is considered, in order to give satisfaction, that each flue should be 13 square and the inside of each coated with cement plaster and flue lining. It is further noted that the services of a competent bricklayer can be obtained at Lac la Ronge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. T. B. R.

In this connection I have to inform you that the Department has decided to pay one-half the cost. A cheque to the amount of $500 was forwarded your Commission at the end of March, 1933, and a further payment is now being made, to the amount of $270.59, making a total reimbursement of $770.59. The total cost of the material, freight on same, and labour, as per the receipted accounts which accompanied the letter above referred to, was $1,541.18, and the two cheques mentioned above, which have been sent, cover one-half this amount.\n\nOur funds are so limited that the above is the full amount the Department can provide towards the cost of the erection of the chimney.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

They understand that a lack of funds has made it impossible for you to contribute the larger sum they were led to expect from my report after my visit to Ottawa last September. As you state in your letter that \"a further payment is now being made,\" I have thought it well to inform you that your cheque for the amount indicated has not yet been received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Rev. G. W. Fisher, Principal of our Society's school at Lac la Ronge has reported that the second chimney in the main school building should be replaced this summer. You will recall that one chimney was replaced last year, and although I received a promise from your Department when I visited Ottawa last September, that the total amount which our Commission had expended in building the new chimney would be refunded, you informed me at a later date that your funds would only admit of meeting half the amount. While our Commission were disappointed that you were unable to refund the full amount, they agreed, under the circumstances, to pay the other half, even though they could ill afford to do so on account of the great difficulties created through the 15% cut in the per capita grants. They feel, however, that your Department should meet the total cost of the second chimney which is urgently required, if the school management and pupils are to be delivered from the constant dread of fire which is inseparable from a defective chimney. Our Commission have received an estimate of the cost of materials, including 2500 bricks, 50 fire bricks, flashing, labour, freight, etc., and they find that the total cost will be approximately $700.00, and they desire to know if you will authorize this expenditure. As the material must be shipped at the earliest date possible, if it is to be delivered at Lac la Ronge before the winter trail breaks up, our Commission will be deeply obliged if you will give this matter your immediate attention, and advise me of your decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that to replace the chimney would cost, approximately $700.\n\nI regret that no provision has been made in our Estimates for this purpose, and, under these circumstances, it will not be possible to authorize the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

(RG 10, Volume 6316, file 656-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Principals,\nIndian Residential Schools, M.S.C.C.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThe recent destruction by fire of the Roman Catholic School at Lac la Plonge, Sask., when one Sister and 19 Indian children were burned to death has brought home to our Commission the vital importance of taking every possible precaution against fire in the Schools under their administration, and of having the staff and pupils so well accustomed to fire drill that every command will be promptly and faithfully obeyed in the moment of emergency. It is the wish, therefore, and the instruction of the Commission that you should satisfy yourself that nothing is being left undone to safeguard the School over which you preside from destruction and even from damage by fire, and that the staff and children should become so familiarized with fire drill and the use of fire escapes where they have been provided, that they will not hesitate to act in time of emergency with the steadiness and confidence of conduct, which those well-trained and disciplined always display when going through their drill or on parade.\n\nYour careful attention to this important matter will oblige,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nTBRW/JR\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nWith further reference to my telegram of March 29th, and your reply to the same on the same day re (1) the loss by fire of the Principal's residence at Lac la Ronge, (2) authority to spend a sum not exceeding $700.00 for a new chimney on the main school building, and (3) authority to close the school until a new chimney can be erected should the fire hazard be as great as stated in my telegram, I beg to submit the following information:\n\n1. With regard to the loss of the Principal's residence, I may state that in a letter received here yesterday from the Rev. Principal Fisher, he states that the fire was caused through sparks from the chimney lighting on the roof, but despite the best efforts of himself, the staff, and the neighbours to extinguish it, the building was completely destroyed. Some personal effects and equipment were saved, but no lives were lost. The Principal states that he will find accommodation in the main school building for the balance of this year, or until such time as a new residence has been provided.\n\n2. Immediately after receiving your telegram authorizing the building of a new chimney in the main school building, we telegraphed our freighting agent in Prince Albert to ascertain if he could deliver bricks, cement, etc., before the trail broke up, but have heard in reply that this is quite impossible. As it is also impossible to forward 2500 or 3000 bricks, cement, etc., during the summer months, our Commission will see that these are taken through at the beginning of next winter. In the meantime the Principal is being instructed to effect such repairs to the chimney as will enable it to be used without great risk until the new one can be built. Very little firing will be done during the summer months, and with the repairs it is hoped that the chimney may serve until the Spring of 1935, by which time the material can be sent in and the work of erecting a new one undertaken. I expect to visit this\nschool myself sometime this summer, and I will then give the matter my personal attention.\n\n3. The concern of our Commission over the question of fire hazard through defective chimneys, will be explained to you by the enclosed copy of a letter addressed to the Principals of all our schools on Sept. 24th, 1927. At that time your predecessor, Dr. Duncan C. Scott, addressed a circular letter to the Principals of Indian Residential Schools on Oct. 6th, 1927, the first paragraph of which reads as follows:\n\n\"The recent tragic fire at the Beauville School, resulting in a serious loss of life, prompts me to write concerning the necessity of constant care, if the fire hazard to life and property is to be minimized. If you are not satisfied with the present fire escape facilities at your school, I should be grateful if you would let the Department have a report.\"\n\nFrom that time onward our Commission has impressed upon the Principals of the schools under their control the vital necessity of providing every possible safeguard against an outbreak of fire, and the members feel strongly that they should not be held responsible for any accidents which may result from defective chimneys, or lack of adequate fire fighting equipment, especially after the Department had agreed with our Society to meet capital expenditure of this sort.\n\nFrom what I have stated in section 2 above, I am of the opinion that the school may continue to operate until the Spring of 1935, and I beg to thank you on behalf of our Commission, for the authority you have given to spend $700.00 in providing the second new chimney required. If we can have it built at an earlier date, we shall certainly do so, but on account of the freighting difficulties mentioned, I have strong doubt as to the possibility of our being able to accomplish this.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nTERW/JF\n\nIndian Affairs.

As the school's lighting and water systems will be brought to a standstill if the repairs are not effected shortly, I shall be obliged if you will give the matter your earliest and most sympathetic consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nHarold W. McGill, Esq., M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:-\n\nIn my letter of April 7th last, addressed to you in reply to your telegram of March 29th, I stated that I expected to visit our Lac la Ronge School this summer, when I would give my personal attention to the condition of the second chimney in the main school building. I have recently returned from a visit which lasted from May 26th until June 1st, and am pleased to be able to report as follows:\n\n1. That the new chimney which was built last year is of excellent workmanship, and will add greatly to the safety of the school.\n\n2. That the chief defect in the second chimney is in the part which appears above the roof. There is a small crack in the basement which can be closed with cement so as to render it serviceable during the coming winter. I authorized, at our Commission's expense, repairs to the top part of the chimney, and feel confident that, with care and vigilance this chimney may be made to serve through another winter, when the building of the second chimney you have authorized will be undertaken. We are fortunate in being able to secure locally the services of an expert mason for this work.\n\n3. As I did not consider the chimney in the laundry fully met the conditions of safety we desire, I authorized the building of another this summer. The cost of this improvement will also be met by our Commission.\n\n-GENERAL SURVEY-\n\nAt the time of my visit the school had 98 pupils in residence, and a staff of 14 agents, exclusive of my daughter Miss D. Westgate, R.N., who is discharging the duties of school and\nA strict nurse at that centre. All the pupils were in good health, with the exception of 3, who were suffering from tuberculosis, with varying prospects of recovery under treatment. As the school has no infirmary, and patients have to be kept in cots on the spacious verandahs of the main school building, it would be a great help to the Principal and his staff and the nurse if a small detached building could be erected for the accommodation of such cases. As the school could supply the lumber and put up the building if a grant of $200.00 were made for shingles, doors, windows, nails, stove, etc., our Commission will be obliged if you will kindly give this matter your own personal consideration.\n\nI found that fire drill was regularly practised, and when the alarm was sounded during my visit the school was fully cleared in three minutes. As a bent iron bar is made to serve as a fire alarm, and cannot be distinctly heard in the remoter parts of the building, I feel strongly that an electric alarm system should be installed with gongs on each floor, and beg to recommend that this important matter also be given your own personal consideration.\n\nAdequate farming and gardening land is a serious problem at all our schools in the northern parts, and Lac la Ronge is no exception. Since my last visit three years ago, the school management, by great manual labour, had cleared and fenced two acres. During my visit drills were made with hoes and mattocks and we \"planted\" this area with oats and brome grass seed mixed. It would be a great help if a grant could be made by your Department to help in the clearing of additional land, where oats and green feed could be grown, and we would be saved the heavy expense of having to supply the same from Prince Albert.\n\nThe furnaces, three in number, are, on the whole, in very good condition, requiring only some minor repairs such as door shields, bottom dampers, and stove pipe dampers, as mentioned in the list forwarded to your Department on October 11th last (page 46), but galvanized cold air, in-take furnace pipes are sorely needed, as the Principal stated that it was very difficult last winter to get any warmth into certain parts of the building. I asked the Principal to direct the attention of the representative of your Department who would accompany the Treaty party this year, to this special need, and also to the need of 16 additional batteries for the lighting system.\n\nI have already addressed two letters to the Secretary of your Department referring to the urgent need of a new cylinder head and carburetter for the engine which operates the lighting and water systems, but so far have received no communication in reply to either letter. As the cost involved does not exceed $85.00 for these items of equipment, delivered at the school, and as their early provision may prevent a much heavier expenditure which may result through delay, it will be appreciated if you will give this matter your own personal attention.\n\nA new residence should be supplied for the Principal not later than next year, to take the place of the one destroyed by fire.\nlast March. The school management will cut the lumber required for this building during the present summer, and our Commission instructed me to ascertain what help your Department would be able to give in providing doors, windows, shingles, nails, paint, etc., which will have to be purchased and sent in from outside. The school management will do the work, but our Commission feel that they could not meet all the expenditure involved.\n\nOur Commission have authorized, at my recommendation very considerable improvements to the subsidiary buildings, also some furniture and furnishings, but the main school building stands sorely in need of paint, inside and outside, including the roof, and I would assure you that any help your Department may be able to give in meeting the needs I have specified will be very deeply appreciated.\n\nThe work being accomplished is, to my mind, altogether worthy of the fullest support which your Department and our Society are able to give it.\n\nWith very good wishes, Believe me,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, July 4th, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th ultimo, with reference to the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School. The contents of your letter have been carefully considered and it is found that funds to the amount of $200 can be provided for the material required in the erection of an infirmary. You may forward accounts covering the cost of shingles, doors, windows, etc., to an amount not exceeding that stated above.\n\nThe purchase of the cylinder head and fuel pump for the engine was authorized by official letter of the 16th ultimo.\n\nI regret that, at the present time, it is not possible to provide funds for any of the other improvements mentioned in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n39-45 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nLeask, Sask.,\nJuly 14th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen paying annuity money at Lac-la-Ronge I had occasion to examine the three furnaces there, and must say I found them in a very bad state of repair. In my opinion there is great danger of fire occurring if same are not attended too before school re-opens next fall. On account of the distance from Prince Albert it is difficult for me to give an estimate of cost of repairs, if you grant authority same will be kept down to the lowest.\n\nFire alarm system is also very inadequate at this school and I feel reasonable sure that persons in certain parts of the building if fire should occur during night would not hear alarm in use at present. I would suggest that a three bell system be installed, only bell is now in use. I have no idea just what such a system will cost, though no doubt you could have the necessary supplies sent direct to Lac la Ronge from Ottawa.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, July 25, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 19th ultimo, I beg to say that the Department is now in receipt of a letter from Mr. Agent Davis in connection with the furnaces at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. Your letter of the 19th ultimo states that only minor repairs are required, and you also recommended that cold air intake pipes be supplied.\n\nIn official letter of the 16th ultimo, the Department authorized an expenditure of $85 for the purchase of a new cylinder head and fuel pump for the engine, and in official letter of the 4th instant the sum of $200 was authorized for the erection of an infirmary.\n\nThere are so many demands on our Appropriation that it is found, in addition to the expenditures already authorized at the Lac la Ronge School, the Department can only allow another $100. You may, therefore, decide what you consider is the most necessary at this school at the present time and arrange for supplying same, provided its cost does not exceed $100.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

He was also advised on the 25th ultimo that, in addition to the above, the Department would allow another $100 to be expended for whatever purpose was considered most necessary.\n\nIn view of the above expenditures at this school, the Department is unable to provide the amount requested for kalsomine, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

While there will be a full sized basement, you will note that no plan has been submitted with regard to the upstairs part of the building, and our Commission will be obliged if your architect can make it possible to furnish the same. It is the understanding of our Commission that the school management will be able to cut this winter all the lumber required for this residence, and the infirmary, and our Commission hopes that as liberal appropriation as possible may be made in the Department's estimates for next year for the erection of these two very necessary buildings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, November 1, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, requesting that plans and specifications be forwarded for a new residence for the Principal of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School and enclosing ground floor sketch for the proposed building, for the consideration of the Architect.\n\nIn reply I would say that, during a recent visit of the Principal of this School, he drew attention to the need of a new residence.

The trouble you mention is apparently due to the presence of iron in the form of the soluble salt, iron bicarbonate. When such water is allowed to stand or is heated in a boiler, the iron bicarbonate decomposes to give carbon dioxide and iron oxide, the latter appearing as a reddish sludge. The iron may therefore be removed by aeration (spraying the water and settling) or by long exposure to the air in tanks or finally by chemical treatment. Thus treatment with lime or soda ash would remove all the iron and soften the water considerably.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd) V. A.

January 12th, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen I visited our Lac la Ronge School in June of last year, my attention was directed to difficulties which had arisen in connection with the water supply for the main school building. The supply which is drawn from a well, and not from the lake, frequently comes out of the pipes a reddish colour. It was also found that the water was seriously affecting the whole piping system. Arrangements were made to have a sample of the water analyzed, and enclosed herewith you will find the result of the analysis as forwarded to the Rev. Principal Fisher by the Provincial Analyst in the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nIn his covering letter to me the Rev. Principal Fisher states that the school management have done all they possibly can to overcome the trouble, but without avail. He recommends the installation of a water softener, and so far as our Commission can see, the only way in which the situation can be remedied is to provide the school with a water softening process, or to arrange for the school's supply of water to be drawn from the lake instead of from the well. As the latter process would probably be much more expensive than the other, our Commission would recommend that a water softener be supplied.\n\nYour careful and sympathetic consideration of this important matter will be greatly appreciated by our Commission.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He said that the Division of Sanitation, Dept. of Public Health, Regina, had asked him to make a report on the same. I replied to this letter on Dec. 4th.\n\nI would like to say that the matter of sewage disposal is causing me considerable anxiety this winter. Our pipe system seems to be all right, but this winter we are seldom free from an offensive odour in the building, which is more marked when the wind is from the East. I have thoroughly examined any possible place where there might be an escape of sewer gas, but have failed to find any leak. What I would suggest is that the outside system towards the Lake has become saturated, and requires overhauling. I might add I have had complaints from time to time from local residents regarding the smell given off from our sewage plant, and I called the attention of Indian Agent to this last Summer. Would you kindly write the Department asking that this matter be dealt with in an efficient manner during the coming summer. The Indian Agent will be visiting the school about July 4th.\n\nI am enclosing a rough sketch made by Mr. Hastings showing the general plan of our sewage disposal plant.

The matter of overhauling the sewage disposal system will receive consideration next summer, after we are definitely aware as to the amount available that can be expended in connection with the carrying out of needed improvements at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D. D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nWINNIPEG, MAN., January 26th, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nThe sum of $200.00 has been authorized by your Department towards the building of an infirmary at our Lac la Ronge School. Kindly let me know if this amount must be expended before the end of the current fiscal year on March 31st next.\n\nOur Commission are keenly desirous of having this infirmary and the residence for the Principal at this school built during the coming summer; but such items as doors and door frames, windows, shingles, etc., etc., would have to be sent in over the winter trail if the building work is to be undertaken in the summer months. In our list of requirements submitted to your Department on November 1st last, the sum of $8,500.00 was included for the residence, and if there is any possibility of your being able to let me know before the winter trail breaks up, if this amount is sanctioned, it will be a great help to our Commission. I realize, of course, that your decision in the matter will depend on Parliamentary action on your estimates, but you will see that unless items such as I have mentioned above are sent through over the winter trail, the building of the residence must be postponed for another year. As this will be very inconvenient, our Commission are anxious to avoid so great a delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\nOttawa, January 31, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, referring to the authority granted for an expenditure of $200.00 in the purchase of shingles, doors, windows, etc., to be used in the erection of a small detached building as an infirmary for the pupils' use at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department has no particulars concerning the number, size, etc., of the above mentioned building materials. It is presumed you have this information. Mr. Inspector Hamilton is being authorized to consult you and arrange for the purchase of the building supplies required for the infirmary, to an amount not exceeding the sum stated, viz.: $200.00.\n\nRegarding a grant towards the cost of erecting a residence for the Principal during the coming summer and the forwarding of the building materials this winter, I have to say that, while the sum of $2,500 is included in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year, and which are now before Parliament, I am unable to state, at the present time, whether the amount will be granted. It will be necessary for you to give the Department full details of the required number and the sizes of the doors, door frames, windows, and also the quantity of shingles, cement, and other building materials. It is possible that you have this information, and I would be pleased if you would forward particulars to the Department at the earliest possible date, when consideration will be given to placing the order and having the building supplies shipped.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, February 1st, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from Rev. T. B. R. Westgate, Field Secretary, M. S. C. C., Winnipeg, requesting authority to incur an expenditure to the amount of $200 in the purchase of shingles, doors, door frames, windows, etc., to be used in the erection of a small building as an infirmary for pupil use at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. He requests that this material be purchased and forwarded from Prince Albert, by sleigh, during the present winter.\n\nThe Department will approve of an expenditure of the above amount, and I would request that you consult Dr. Westgate, obtain from him particulars of the building materials required, and arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the approved list. The cost should not exceed the above stated amount. You should also arrange for the forwarding of the supplies to Prince Albert or to the nearest point from which freighting to the school is done. Dr. Westgate will be able to supply you with shipping directions. I would request that the purchase and shipping of the above mentioned materials be made at an early date.\n\nPlease forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost, and attach receipt for any freight charges. The Department would like to receive the accounts before our books close at the end of the present fiscal year, in order that payment can be made from the current year's appropriation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I.D. Letter 132-2-5.\nNov. 1st, 1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSome time ago I received the copy of the letter received by you from the Indian Department with reference to the building the new residence at this school, and I note that plans and specifications will be prepared after it is known whether funds will be available for this purpose.\n\nAs this will probably be after March 31st, before this will be known, I would suggest that it will be too late then to begin to send to Lac la Ronge the materials necessary to build during the coming summer, therefore I am enclosing a list of the materials which I think will be needed. I have based my estimates on the plan submitted to you for consideration. Of course, you could have my figures checked over by an expert.\n\nYou will notice that I am asking for wallboard for the lining of the house throughout. I have done this after very careful consideration, and for the following reason. In the old house we were always having trouble with the plaster falling; and I would suggest that the best finish will be wallboard put on over a sheathing of half-inch lumber. While possibly it will cost more to ship in the wallboard than lime, the difference in the cost will be more than made up in the saving of time, and by the fact that Hastings and I can do the work, whereas if we plaster it will be necessary to employ an expert plasterer. The joints would be covered with wallboard tape, and the whole finally papered. I hope you will agree to this proposal.\n\nI am also submitting a list of the materials required for building the residence chimney. Mr. VanderKraft's estimate for building the school chimney calls for 2600 bricks, and the residence main chimney 1950 bricks. In addition 300 bricks will be required for the kitchen chimney. Therefore 1300 more bricks will be needed over and above the 3600 already ordered.\nWith regard to the furnace I have merely indicated the items required, and I would ask that an expert be asked to check over these items, and say just what will be required. If you require a copy of the plan already submitted, and will let me know over CFQC, Saskatoon, I will forward one on Wednesday next.\n\nAn additional amount of lime and cement will be needed for building the basement wall, but before asking for any definite amount, I would like to consult Mr. Vanderkraft again on this matter, and as soon as I have done this I will write to you again.\n\nI would also call attention to the item: 2300 ft. of fir flooring. I am asking for this because we cannot make really good flooring at the school mill, and I feel sure it will pay in the long run to put down good floors.\n\nI would also like to call attention to the fact that if the materials are supplied, Mr. Hastings and I will be able to take care of the carpenter work, and it will be unnecessary to engage any outside labour save for the building of the basement wall and chimneys, and possibly to install the furnaces.\n\nThere are two books on page 294 of Eaton's Catalogue, which while they are not absolutely necessary, would be of great help to us in building. I shall be glad if you will send me by mail books #712-R188 and R189. I am sure these books will be of great help to us.\n\nI am, Yours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) G. W.

February 7, 1935.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Principal's Residence Lac la Ronge.\n\nIn response to the request embodied in the closing paragraph of your letter of the 31st ultimo No. 132-2-5 for a detailed list of doors, door frames, windows, shingles, cement, and other building materials required for the new residence for the Principal of our Lac la Ronge School, I am enclosing herewith the list submitted by the Principal, and with it a copy of his explanatory letter which accompanied the same. In the last paragraph on page 1 of his letter he has referred to bricks for a chimney in the main school building as well as those for the residence, but a further communication will be addressed to you regarding the school chimney when the bills for freighting the bricks have come to hand. It is expected that these will be available in the near future.\n\nIf the residence is to be built this coming summer the necessary building materials must be sent in before the winter trail closes, and it seems to me that as soon as you know that the sum you have included in your estimate for this purpose is granted, the best course to take would be to authorize the Principal to come out to Prince Albert and Saskatoon, to select the materials himself and arrange for immediate shipment. Our Commission will, however, very gladly carry out any instructions you may issue in this connection. The winter trail generally becomes uncertain after the end of March.\n\nWith regard to the infirmary referred to in the earlier part of your letter, I may say that I have been in communication with Inspector Hamilton.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6316, file 656-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFebruary 13, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nThe sum of $2,500.00 is provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the coming fiscal year towards the cost of erecting a residence for the Principal of the Indian Residential School at Lac la Ronge, (Reserve No. 186, Ile-a-la-Crosse Agency, Sask., Federal District of Melfort). This school is conducted under the auspices of the Missionary Society of the Church of England, and Reverend T. B. R. Westgate, Field Secretary, E. S. C. C., is strongly urging that the building materials be purchased and forwarded before the present winter trails close. He states that, if the materials are not delivered this winter, it will be impossible to build the residence during the coming summer.\n\nDr. Westgate has submitted a detailed list of doors, door frames, windows, shingles, cement, hardware and other building materials required. The source of supply for these materials would be Prince Albert, Saskatoon, or Winnipeg. Dr. Westgate suggests the best course to take in arranging for the purchase and obtaining the quantities and sizes of the various materials would be to authorize the Principal to come out to Prince Albert and Saskatoon to select them, himself, and arrange for their freighting to the school.\n\nI would request your authority to incur the expenditure for the purchase of the building materials - it being understood, however, that payment of the accounts would not be made until the Appropriation for the coming fiscal year is available. I request, also, that you will advise if it will be satisfactory for the Principal or Dr. Westgate to arrange for the purchase. They would be instructed to obtain itemized accounts, covering the cost. They will be given the names of firms on the approved list from whom to make purchase. If the materials are to be forwarded this winter, by sleigh, from Prince Albert to the school - a distance of approximately 300 miles - it is necessary that early arrangements be made.\n\nI may say that the greater part of the labour in the erection of the building will be carried out by the school authorities, without expense to the Department. The total cost of the building materials which the school authorities request be purchased and forwarded this winter will be approximately $1,100.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to Department letter 132-2-5 dated February 1st, I wish to state that I have been in communication with Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary of the M.S.C.C., but he was unable to give me the required information in connection with the doors and windows. He stated it would be necessary to send a radio message to the Principal of the school and this will probably cause a delay of a few days.\n\nI note that the material is to be shipped to Prince Albert. It occurred to me that if the purchase could be made by the Regina office from those on the approved list in Prince Albert, we might thereby eliminate the local freight charges which no doubt would run into a considerable amount. If this meets with the Department's approval, the list of material could be forwarded to Mr. Murison as soon as obtained from Dr. Westgate. I would appreciate an immediate reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, February 16, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, regarding the purchase of building material, to be used in the erection of a small building as an infirmary for pupils' use at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that Rev. Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary, M. S. C. C., is obtaining particulars concerning the materials required. Your suggestion, that Mr. Murison arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the approved list in Prince Albert, is approved. When you receive the list from Dr. Westgate, you may forward same to Mr. Murison, with the request that he arrange for early purchase. Please inform him that the expenditure for the purpose should not exceed the sum of $200.00 and, also, that he is to obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, certify same and forward direct to the Department for payment.\n\nIt is hoped that the purchase can be completed and the accounts received at the Department before our books close for the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nThe sum of $2,500.00 is provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the coming fiscal year towards the cost of erecting a residence for the Principal of the Indian Residential School at Lac la Ronge, (Reserve No. 156, Ile-a-la-Crosse Agency, Sask., Federal District of Melfort). This school is conducted under the auspices of the Missionary Society of the Church of England, and Reverend T. B. R. Westgate, Field Secretary, M. S. C., is strongly urging that the building materials be purchased and forwarded before the present winter trails close. He states that, if the materials are not delivered this winter, it will be impossible to build the residence during the coming summer.\n\nDr. Westgate has submitted a detailed list of doors, door frames, windows, shingles, cement, hardware and other building materials required. The source of supply for these materials would be Prince Albert, Saskatoon, or Winnipeg. Dr. Westgate suggests the best course to take in arranging for the purchase and obtaining the quantities and sizes of the various materials would be to authorize the Principal to come out to Prince Albert and Saskatoon to select them, himself, and arrange for their freighting to the school.\n\nI would request your authority to incur the expenditure for the purchase of the building materials - it being understood, however, that payment of the accounts would not be made until the Appropriation for the ensuing fiscal year is available. I request, also, that you will advise if it will be satisfactory for the Principal or Dr. Westgate to arrange for the purchase. They would be instructed to obtain itemized accounts, covering the cost. They will be given the names of firms on the approved list from whom to make purchase. If the materials are to be forwarded this winter, by sleigh, from Prince Albert to the school - a distance of approximately 300 miles - it is necessary that early arrangements be made.\n\nI may say that the greater part of the labour in the erection of the building will be carried out by the school authorities, without expense to the Department. The total cost of the building materials which the school authorities request be purchased and forwarded this winter will be approximately $1,100.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, February 18, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing a detailed list of the building materials required for the new residence for the Principal at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School, together with copy of a communication which you received from the Principal. It is noted that these materials should be purchased and forwarded before the present winter trails close, if the residence is to be erected during the coming summer.\n\nIn this connection I have to say the Department agrees with your suggestion, that the Principal come out to Prince Albert and Saskatoon to select the materials, himself, and arrange for their freighting to Lac la Ronge. I would therefore request that you communicate with the Principal and have him arrange for the purchase, at an early date. The following firms are on the approved list, and the Principal should obtain prices and place the order with the firm quoting the lowest price in each case:\n\nPRINCE ALBERT:\n- Mediamid Lumber Company,\n- Manville Hardware Company,\n- M. & P. Plumbing Company.\n\nSASKATOON:\n- Maguire Lumber Company,\n- Saskatoon Lumber & Fuel Company,\n- Reliance Lumber Company,\n- Wood Valence Company (Hardware).\n\nThe Principal should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, giving full details as to quantities of materials and cost. He should certify on each copy as follows: \"Goods delivered - prices fair and just\", and forward the accounts either direct to the Department or through your office. It should be understood, however, that as the appropriation covering the amount provided towards the cost of the residence, viz. $2,500, will not be available until after April first next, the beginning of the coming fiscal year, payment of the accounts cannot be made before that date. The Principal should inform the firms who supply the materials accordingly. The sum stated is the full amount that will be available towards the cost\n\n- of constructing\n\nRev. T. B. R.

He should also forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of freighting the materials from Prince Albert to the school.\n\nShould it be necessary to procure any hardware, fixtures, etc., in Winnipeg, you may arrange for the purchase, but I would request that you consult Mr. Inspector Hamilton regarding the firms on the approved list in Winnipeg.\n\nThe Department is leaving the purchase of the building materials in the hands of yourself and the Principal. It is hoped that no unnecessary expense will be incurred.\n\nI enclose an extra copy of this letter, which you may forward to the Principal, for his information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The chimneys are of brick and in very good shape, furnaces were repaired and are in better shape than at my last inspection. Building is generally in poor condition having been built from green lumber and in such a shape if a fire did break out, I doubt if everyone would get out safely. The eaves are down three brass poles. Children have to make an exit from the roof or verandah on third floor, then down to second verandah and then to the main floor. Only piece of iron is hanging in the hall to raise alarm and a bolt there to hit it with which can very easily be misplaced and not there when wanted. I am doubtful if alarm could be heard by children sleeping or the staff and certainly could not be heard in rear of building. I would recommend that an electric system be installed and a weekly fire drill instituted.\n\nEngine room adjoins main building which is at end of laundry, this is also a lumber building and certainly not fire proof, a certain amount of oil having soaked into floors.\n\nMr. Fisher drew my attention to the engine and lighting system. A new set of batteries will have to be supplied, sixteen large batteries are in use and a request was made that thirty-two be furnished in order to give better service. Type EOGO-13 8 hour capacity, 280 a.h. date H L. Engine is just about worn out needs a new cylinder and piston, this is a 10 horse power Z type engine No. 566204 Fairbanks Morse. I also noticed fire box in oven was burnt out and will take about $25.00 to replace, lining in bricks in cook stove are worn out. Window screens are also in bad shape and will take about $50.00 to replace. Building is in need of decorating inside and out.\n\nThe school is well managed by Mr. Fisher and he feels he is doing good work amongst Indians. However, in my opinion this school should be closed as it is very little use educating them when they have no way of making a living other than trapping which they are unable to do when they are discharged. There is no way of teaching farming as there is no suitable land and the whole thing appears to me to be a waste of good money.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 2, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year provides the sum of $800.00 towards the cost of supplying batteries for the lighting system and also a new engine to operate the lighting plant at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. Mr. R. S. Davis, Indian Agent, Leask, Sask., who visited the school during Treaty payments, states that the Principal drew his attention to the need of the above equipment. The Agent states the present equipment consists of 16 large batteries and that a request was made by the Principal that 32 be furnished, in order to give better service. He says the type required is EOGO-13 8 hour capacity, 280 a.h. The 10 h.p. Fairbanks \"Z\" type engine is worn out and needs a new cylinder and piston.\n\nOwing to the difficulty in having the engine sent to Prince Albert or some other point for repairs, it is considered that it would be better to supply a new engine.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will take up these matters with the Principal and advise the Department definitely as to the type and full particulars regarding the batteries. You should state, also, if you would recommend that a new engine be supplied or that the present one be repaired. If a new engine is recommended, the h.p. and type should be stated. Please state, also, when you would advise that this equipment be forwarded to the school.\n\nBesides the above, there is an item of $800.00 in the Estimates, to carry out repairs and interior painting. I shall be pleased if you will ascertain from the Principal the repairs absolutely necessary at the present time and what interior decorating he requires. If possible, an estimate should be given of the cost of the materials and any outside labour it is necessary to employ.\n\nWhen we have the information asked for above, consideration will be given to authorizing the purchase of the batteries and a new engine, if same is considered necessary, and also the minor repairs and painting. It should be understood, however, that the total amount available for all the above purposes is $1,600.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

Principal Fisher on materials for painting and improving the interior of the school.\n\n(3) Quotation submitted by the T. Eaton Co. Ltd., Winnipeg, on materials for painting the interior of the school.\n\nAs it is considered that the extras amounting to $75.00 given on page 1 of the quotation from the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co., will not be required, the cost of a 10 H.P. 4 cycle, Diesel engine delivered at Lac la Ronge would be approximately $867.70. (See notes I have made in margin on page 2 of the quotation from the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co.)\n\nThe cost of 32 cells, Exide Storage Battery delivered at Lac la Ronge would be $760.00. (See note in margin on page 2 of the quotation from the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co.) The total cost of these two items delivered at Lac la Ronge would be approximately $1627.70.\nThe estimate of the Principal for the painting and material required for the interior of the main school building, is probably a little too high, but I think we may say that it would amount to somewhere around $650.00. As the total estimated cost for the engine, the batteries, and the paints and materials is $2,327.70, and as you have made it quite clear in your letter that the total amount available for these improvements is only $1600.00, I can only recommend that the paints and materials required for the interior of the main school building be allowed to stand over until next year, and that authority be given our Commission to purchase at once the engine and batteries from the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co. at the prices quoted, and arrange for their shipment to the school as soon as the winter trail is open.\n\nAs the painting and improving of the interior of the main school building may best be undertaken during the spring and summer months, authority to spend $650.00 required for the materials should be given to our Commission not later than the beginning of March, so that these may be sent through before the winter trail closes, it being understood that vouchers for the same for payment would not be submitted to your Department before the beginning of the fiscal year 1936-37.\n\nI heartily commend to your favourable consideration the suggestion I have made, and will be obliged if you will let me have your decision at your earliest convenience.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nNovember 8, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,-\n\nThere will be available, in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the present fiscal year, the sum of $2,300.00, towards the cost of supplying an engine and batteries for the lighting plant and paint and other materials required for the interior of the main school building, at the Indian Residential School at Lac la Ronge (Reserve No. 156, Ile a la Crosse Agency - Federal District of Melfort), Sask.\n\nIt will be necessary, if the above mentioned equipment is supplied, that it be obtained in time to be forwarded this coming winter, by sleigh, from Prince Albert to the school - a distance of approximately 300 miles. The school is conducted under the auspices of the Missionary Society of the Church of England, and Reverend T. B. R. Westgate, D.D., Field Secretary, Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, was requested to obtain prices and forward same for the consideration of the Department. Dr. Westgate has obtained a quotation from the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company, Limited, Winnipeg, for the supplying of the engine and batteries, as follows:-\n\n10 h.p. Fairbanks-Morse, Single Cylinder, 4 Cycle, including tank, pipe and fittings, at a price of $900.\n\nThe freight charges on same from Winnipeg to the school would be $42.70, making the total cost, delivered at the school, $942.70.\n\nA quotation was obtained, also, from the above firm, for the supplying of 32 cells type Exide storage battery, at a cost of $649, and the freight charges, delivered at the school would\namount to $111 - a total cost for the batteries, of $760.\n\nDr. Westgate also forwards a quotation, from the T. Eaton Company, Limited, Winnipeg, for the paint for interior painting, to the amount of $370.90, f.o.b. Prince Albert. There is also required a quantity of flooring, stair stepping and plaster. The best source of supply for these materials would be Prince Albert and the approximate cost, delivered at the school, $182.\n\nI would request your authority to incur the expenditure in the purchase of the above mentioned equipment, also your direction if it will be satisfactory for Dr. Westgate to arrange for the purchase, from the sources mentioned, or what other firms you would request be given an opportunity to quote.\n\nI may add that the greater part of the labour in connection with the painting and the installation of the equipment will be carried out by the school authorities, without expense to the Department. The total cost of the equipment, delivered at the school, will be approximately $2,280.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDecember 27, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Pratt,\n\nI wish to refer you to my memorandum, dated November 8th, last, to the Honourable the Superintendent General, regarding the supplying of an engine and batteries for the lighting plant and paint and other materials required for use at the Indian Residential School at Lac la Ronge (Reserve No. 156, Ilse la Crosse Agency - Federal District of Melfort), Sask.\n\nIt is necessary that this equipment be obtained and forwarded during the present winter, by sleigh, from Prince Albert to the school - a distance of approximately 300 miles.

Mr. Hamilton has been given particulars as to the type, etc., of the engine and batteries. He has been requested, also, to get in touch with you before making the purchase, in order that there will be no mistake in the equipment required.\n\nRegarding the purchase of the paint and flooring, the Honourable the Minister has directed that purchase of the paint be made from the Kernaghan Hardware Company, of Prince Albert, and the flooring, stair stepping and hard wall plaster, from the North Star Lumber Company, of the same place.

It is noted, from the estimate obtained by the Principal of the School, that the paint, oils, varnish, alabastine and paint brushes will cost approximately $350.00, and the flooring, stair stepping and hard wall plaster, approximately $100. For your information, I enclose a list of the above requirements, submitted by the Principal.\n\nAccounts, covering the cost of the freighting of the engine, batteries, paint, flooring, etc., from Prince Albert to the school, should be forwarded in triplicate, in favour of the person who does the work, when payment will be made direct to him.

This school in my opinion is overcrowded. For instance classroom grades 1-3, is 20 x 30 with a ten foot wall, containing 74 desks, there is an average of 63 pupils in the room, and it is not possible to open windows as children are packed right up against them. Light is very poor, two windows to east and two to south. Absolutely no ventilation, and air in room is terrible - very unhealthy.\n\nGrades 4-8, room is 24 x 33, walls 10'. Average 50 pupils. This room has five windows, and no ventilation as windows cannot be opened on account of children sitting so close to same.\n\nI consider some system of ventilation should be installed, or another classroom built. Laundry and engine room could be converted into a classroom and laundry and engine room constructed away from the main building.\n\nBlackboards are in very poor condition in room grades 1-3, this would require a new board 22' x 3'.\n\nInfirmary\n\nA year ago $200.00 was allowed to build an infirmary onto school building. This has been erected about 200 yards from the school. This building 28 x 16 - 9' walls, solid brick chimney from ground up, and would consider value of this building to be around $700.00, partly paid out of school funds. It will take $200.00 to complete this building as it will need wall-board inside, and siding outside.\n\nPrincipal's Residence\n\nRev. G. W. Fisher is now residing in new building which was constructed last year. As not enough funds were available this house was not completed. Only one room is completed up-stairs, all downstairs is completed. It will take $500.00 to complete residence.\n\nGeneral\n\nThis school is very well managed. The building is old and nothing more than a fire trap. Some system of fire alarm should be installed, as one in use is no good, and if fire should break out during night I am sure some lives would be lost.\n| QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION OF GOODS                                                                 | LIST PRICE | GROSS EXTENSION | DISCOUNT | NET     |\n|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|----------|---------|\n| 32       | Cells 6600-13 Marine Storage Battery, in sealed type glass jars with gumite covers, assembled sealed and charged, ready for use, including lead plated copper inter-cell connections, lead pipe for series connections between rows of cells, terminal lugs & including one hydrometer & one thermometer.

G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nIn connection with Boarding Schools, I wish some system could be evolved whereby Agents would know just what had been granted in the line of expenditures. Take in the case of Lac-la-Range School, when I visit this place I have no idea what appropriations have been granted or how money has been spent if allowed.\n\nLast summer I reported that certain work should be done and never heard anything about it until Mr. Fisher last month advised me that he head $1,600.00 to spend, at the time of my visit nothing had been done. I have no means whereby I can ascertain if said money will be expended as allowed by the Department or other work substituted on the school in question. I believe an Agent should be more enlightened of what goes on at these schools and if some small system of book-keeping could be established showing appropriations and expenditures it would be better for all concerned, as it is now everything is done through Winnipeg and an Agent just mopes around in the dark.\nMEMO: SCHOOLS BRANCH\n\nThe recent correspondence hereunder from and to the Agent at Carlton is self-explanatory.\n\nNo doubt there is merit in what the Agent points out. He is expected to inspect and report upon schools in his Agency at regular intervals, and naturally wishes to make his reports intelligent for the benefit of the Department.\n\nIf an Agent is not informed of what the Department is doing in connection with his reports upon schools, he is handicapped when submitting a subsequent report.\n\nA suggestion is offered for your consideration; when the Principal is advised of expenditures authorized for his school by the Department, an extra copy of the letter could be forwarded to the Agent concerned. This might be applied to all similar cases.\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nHBR/B\nOttawa, February 28, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 21st instant, addressed to the Representative of the Treasury, regarding expenditures authorized at the Indian residential schools in your Agency, and with special reference to the Lac la Ronge School, I would say that funds were provided in our Estimates for the current fiscal year to supply a lighting system for use at this school. Instructions were given that this equipment be purchased in Winnipeg, and Mr. Inspector Hamilton was requested to arrange for the purchase. A 10 H.P. Diesel power unit, complete with Exide storage batteries, has recently been forwarded, at a cost of $1,617.09.\n\nAuthority has also been given for the purchase of a quantity of paint, oils, varnish, etc., to a cost of approximately $350.00; also flooring, stair stepping and hard wall plaster, to a cost of approximately $100.00.\n\nA Singer sewing machine has also been ordered to be shipped to the Principal.\n\nIn future, the Department will keep in mind advising you of any expenditure authorized at this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

In my letter of March 21st, I stated that the freighter's bill amounted to $125.16. In the enclosed certified bills you will note that the amount is $130.37. The difference is due to the weight of the shipment from the North Star Lumber Co. When the Principal submitted the bills which were forwarded to you with my letter of March 21st., he had not received any bill of lading from the North Star Lumber Co. and accepted the freighter's receipt for a tare weight of 2700 lbs. The goods arrived at Lac la Ronge on March 24th. and he immediately sent out a letter by aeroplane to the North Star Lumber Co. asking for the exact weight. He was informed by radiogram that it was 2900 lbs. As the freighting charges are $2.60 per hundred, the difference is explained with the exception of one cent. If the freighter's account has already been paid, our Commission will, under the circumstances, meet the difference. Kindly advise me of the amount that you are paying to the freighter (Mr. William A. Bear, Prince Albert, Sask), so that our Commission may pay the balance if required, and have the account settled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, April 11, 1936.\n\nRev.

Three fires have occurred since my last visit January 1936, which were gotten under control.\n\nOne occurred in January in the kitchen, which did no damage.\n\nThe second started on the roof and attic floor, and if this had not been discovered in time no doubt the building would have been completely destroyed.\n\nThe third started in the wall between the play room on the girls side of the building burning a portion of the wall between the play and class rooms. This was caused from the new chimney that was built last year. This work was done by the Commission with instructions direct from the Department. In my opinion this chimney should not be used, as it will in all probability start another fire, and if it occurred during the night I feel sure lives would be lost.\n\nThe fire-alarm system consists of an iron bar and bolt and cannot be heard in all parts of the building. I had the fire-hose tested and found in good condition. If a fire should start in the basement it would not be long before water supply would be cut off as engine is located there.\n\nFire-drill was held and it took the children seven minutes to vacate, but if a fire started with everyone excited they would not get the children out in anything like this time. If the Department had some form of instructions to be followed in fire-drill, such as a check on children when they got out and what should be done by different members, would be of great help. If an experienced Fire Chief could visit some of these Boarding Schools and make recommendations to be followed, it would bear some weight and help officials when checking these schools. Most of the staffs are not level headed, if they were would not be holding down the positions they do.\n\nThe children's food consist of fish, bread and lard, three times a day; once or twice a week they get peanut butter for supper, also some oatmeal is added for breakfast.\n\nSchool draws its pupils from Stanley, Lac-la-Ronge and Montreal Lake. In my opinion they should not be allowed to take pupils from Montreal Lake, as we have a good day school there, and only makes the cost of education out of all reason.\n\nYours truly,\nR. S. Davis\n(Signed)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\nOttawa, July 23rd, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to your inspection of the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, Field Secretary of the M.S.C.C., is being written regarding the chimney, which you state constitutes a fire hazard.\n\nI enclose three copies of a circular letter addressed to principals of Indian residential schools, with reference to giving constant and intelligent thought to the danger of fire. You should forward a copy of these instructions to the Principal of the Lac La Ronge School.\n\nI may say that the Department allows a grant of $35 a month for the employment of a night watchman at the Lac La Ronge School from November 1st to March 31st. It is presumed that the Principal of the Lac La Ronge School engages a capable man for this duty.\n\nFor your information, I may say that Rev. T. B. R. Westgate, Field Secretary of the M.S.C.C., has been informed that in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year the following amounts were provided for the Lac La Ronge School:\n\n- Paint for buildings - $350.00\n- Material and freight, repairing roof, main building - $550.00\n- Material and freight, renewing floor in boys' playroom and kitchen - $250.00\n- Purchase linoleum and freight on same - $175.00\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

It is my present understanding that the chimney itself was well built, but that some of the beams in the framework of the School were in too close contact with it. I am of the opinion that this matter has already been attended to, but I am calling the attention of the Principal to it in case it has not.\n\nRecently the roof of the building caught fire from a spark from one of the chimneys, but this was extinguished before any extensive damage was done. To prevent a recurrence of this sort of thing our Commission are considering the possibility of having the School covered with metal shingles. After they have secured comparative prices on the different kinds of non-inflammable roofing, I may write to you again in the matter. In the meantime I wish to assure you that our Commission and the School management will continue to do everything possible to eliminate fire hazards at this institution.\nWhile writing on this subject, I desire to lay before you the urgent need of an adequate fire alarm system for this School. This need is set forth in the following extract from a letter from the Principal, dated June 2, 1936:\n\n\"In connection with our fire alarm system, I would like to say it is an understood thing in the community at large, that the continuous ringing of the school bell is a call for assistance. On Monday our alarm failed to call anyone, and for the following reasons. First, the bell began to ring at the usual \"first bell\" hour of 8.45. Secondly, in the anxiety to ring the bell as loudly as possible, the bell was turned over, and so could not be rung properly. I would like to suggest that the Commission urge upon the Indian Department the necessity of providing us with an adequate fire alarm system both inside and outside of the building. For outside use, I would suggest a siren whistle. I believe these can be obtained to be operated by a hand crank.\n\nTwo years ago I called the attention of the Indian Agent to the need for a better alarm system within the building, and he promised to take up the matter with the Department, but so far, the Department has done nothing. It is my intention to speak to the Indian Agent again, when he visits the school on June 19th.\n\nIn conclusion: I would like to say that the fire was not caused by anyone's neglect. The chimneys have been regularly swept. Mr. Courtney has been very careful in this matter, and we have had no chimney fires.\"\n\nIt will be appreciated if your Department will give this very important matter immediate attention, and instruct your representative, Mr. Indian Agent Davis, to supply this School with suitable fire alarm systems for both inside and outside use.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, August 11, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nThe suggestion of the Principal, with reference to installing a fire alarm system, has been noted, and it is considered that the cost involved could be provided from the amount which you were informed in official letter of May first the Department had provided for the Lac la Ronge School this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 23rd ult., No. 132-2-5, and my reply to the same on the 6th inst. I beg to state that I referred to the Principal of our Lac la Ronge School the reference made by Mr. Indian Agent Davis to the new chimney which was built last year, and the following is an extract from the Principal's reply on the 18th inst.:\n\n\"I have already done all I can to make the chimney safe. Since Mr. Davis reported it unsafe, I have written to him asking him to tell me just wherein he thinks it is unsafe, so that I may know just what to do more than I have already done. The only defect I could find, was that the wood-work of the ground floor of the school was built into the chimney, and this has been remedied.\"\n\nIn the light of the information set forth in the above extract, I think you may be assured that the matter in question is receiving careful attention.\n\nAs a means of further eliminating the fire hazard at this school our Commission are keenly desirous of having the wooden shingles replaced by metal ones. In my letter of the 6th inst. I stated that we were securing comparative prices, and those received from the T. Eaton Company, Winnipeg, are as follows:\n\n# 1-B c Cedar XXX Shingles - $4.75 per M\n# 2 \" \" \" - $3.65 \" M\n\nMetal Shingles for 44 sheets - $10.70\n\n1-M Cedar Shingles will cover 100 square feet 4\u00bd inches to the weather.\n44 Sheets Metal ditto will cover the same surface.\n\nThe quotation for Cedar Shingles is for IMMEDIATE ACCEPTANCE - they vary almost from day to day.\n\nAugust 6th - 1936\n\nI cannot give you the exact area of the roof to be covered, but estimate that it would be about 8,400 feet. The cost of metal shingles to cover such an area would be approximately $900.00 apart from transportation charges. As it is not possible for our Commission or for the school management to meet this expenditure out of the amount sanctioned in your official letter of May 1st, I cannot see any prospect of having a metal roof provided until funds are made available for this purpose by your Department.\n\nAs the metal shingles could not be sent through before the winter trail opens, I would earnestly request that authority be given to our Commission to purchase the shingles and send them through before the winter trail closes, the cost to be met out of your appropriation for the fiscal year 1937-38. Such an arrangement would enable us to remove, so far as is possible, one of the greatest fire hazards at a school where wood fuel is used.\n\nYour sympathetic consideration of this important matter will be highly appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/KH\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, August 26, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department is not in a position to authorize the expenditure that would be required to purchase metal shingles for this building at the present time.\n\nWhen forwarding your requirements for the next fiscal year, you might include this item and the matter will then receive further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 the Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 8, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter dated May first, 1936, regarding the repairs and materials authorized at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. I should be pleased to be informed if the work has been completed and, if so, I would request that you furnish itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRE GRANT FOR REPAIRS, LAC LA RONGE SCHOOL\nC. of E.\n\nWith regard to the information requested in your letter of the 8th ultimo., No. 132-2-5, in connexion with the repairs and materials authorized at our Lac la Ronge School, I beg to state that this work has not been completed, and cannot be completed until we are able to send through the materials required when the winter trail opens. Your letter informing us of the grant available was dated May 1, 1936, and as last winter's freighting season closed about the end of March, most of the materials required could not be sent forward until the winter trail again opened.\n\nFor your information I may say that the School management did all they could in the way of painting during the summer holidays, and in effecting minor repairs. Certified bills in this connexion have come to hand, but the major repairs yet remain to be done. These are receiving our careful attention. The largest and most important of them is that of providing the main school building with a metal roof. The Principal has recommended that galvanized iron be used, and we are now awaiting a list of quantities and exact measurements before placing an order for the same.\n\nTo our Commission it is a matter of first rate importance that this School which burns wood fuel should be provided with a roof of non-inflammable material, but I am convinced in my own mind that it cannot be provided out of the\ngrant of $1,325.00 which you have sanctioned.\n\nAs soon as we have secured the information requested, with regard to quantities and measurements, and are able to get an estimate of the cost plus transportation charges, I will write to you again in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/KH\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, November 10, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, regarding the repairs and materials authorized at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. It is noted that the work authorized cannot be completed until the materials can be sent forward by winter freight. The Department would be pleased to receive itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, for any expenditure incurred in work that has been completed and in the purchase of materials to go forward by winter freight. These accounts should be forwarded in time to reach Ottawa before our books for the fiscal year close, at the end of March, next.\n\nRegarding the materials for the shingling of the roof, I would say that the Department included, in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year, the sum of $1,000.00 for the shingling of the roof with metal shingles. It will, therefore, not be necessary to incur the expenditure of $550. for material and freight in repairing the roof, as authorized in official letter of the first of May, last. This work can be paid out of the coming year's appropriation. The purchase of the material, however, should be made in time to go forward by the coming winter's freight. If you arrange for the purchase in Winnipeg, which, it is presumed, would be the best source of supply, I would request that you consult Mr. Inspector Hamilton, regarding the firms from whom prices should be obtained.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

He stated that most of money allowed had been spent on shingles and freight.\n\nOn questioning Mr. Fisher on what he was paying for freight he stated that the Commission was paying Mr. W.A.

G. W. Fisher, Principal of our Lac la Ronge School, re freight rates.\n\nIn 1935 it is understood that Revillon Freres and the Hudson's Bay Company were both paying $2.50 per 100 lbs. for their freighting. The Commission had been paying $3.00 per 100 lbs. for theirs, and they therefore took up the matter with their freighter. The result was that a rate of $2.50 per 100 lbs. was arranged for 1936 with our Indian freighter. It was pointed out that a lower price would be quoted for a contract for 150 tons than for one of 50 tons, which is the School's estimate.\n\nIt is true that the Hudson's Bay Company, having eliminated Revillon Freres were able to make a contract for $1.75 per 100 lbs. for 1936, but evidently the contractor lost money on the deal, as the rate for 1937 has been advanced to $2.25 per 100 lbs.\n\nFor many years, the Commission have given their freight contract to W. A. Bear, in order to help him out. He is an Indian and has always taken a keen interest in the School. In a letter written by him to the Commission in August, 1935, he asks: \"So do you think $2.60 per hundred be O.K.? One can come out O.K. at this rate in good years. In hard winters I know will keep me scratching to come out right. I am game to try my luck for this winter at this rate, $2.60 per hundred.\"\n\nThe question with Mr. Bear will be re-opened in view of Mr. Davis' report as the Commission cannot afford to pay more than ordinary freight rates.\nDear Mr. Hoey:-\n\nI beg to submit the following extract taken from a letter from Mr. Davis, Agent at Carlton:\n\n\"The water supply at the Lac la Ronge school is not of the best, obtaining their supply from the lake. I consider a well should be sunk or the old one made deeper. This would cost about $200.00, and I am not in a position to say who should pay this the Church Commission or our Department\".\n\nMr. Davis discussed this matter with me when in Regina some days ago. It is his opinion that the present water supply is dangerous.\n\nI would appreciate receiving instructions in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 14, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the suggestion of Indian Agent Davis regarding the water supply at the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nProvided there is a reasonable assurance of obtaining water and that the new well can be sunk or the old one made deeper at a cost not exceeding $200.00, you may authorize Indian Agent Davis to proceed with the necessary work at this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

While the deepening of the well may help to reduce the hazard, it will not eliminate the process of corroding which is said to be gradually destroying the water pipes. Our Commission, at very considerable expense, provides this School with a water-softening plant, and while it softens the water, the corroding process is still reported to continue. It is therefore the well considered opinion of the Commission that the source of this School's water supply should be changed from the well now used to the lake, on the shore of which the School is located. As the water supply at our Onion Lake and Sioux Lookout Schools is taken from adjacent lakes, we have good reason to believe that the change suggested at our Lac la Ronge School would be fully justified.\n\nYour sympathetic consideration of this suggestion will be duly appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/KH\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6316, file 656-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have received certain information that there is eighty feet of 2\" pipe at Lac La Ronge belonging to District No. 10 of the Military Dept.\n\nIf this information is correct, would it be possible to have this pipe transferred to the Indian Department for use at the Lac La Ronge Indian Boarding School. As you are aware the water supply at this school is very poor and we have the authority, H. O. 132-2-5, May 14th 1937, to dig a well at this point. In order to get the pipe necessary for this well it would be necessary to have them freighted in to Lac La Ronge by airplane, as this is the only means of summer transportation to this point. The cost of such freighting is prohibitive. Therefore the only alternative we have, if the well is to be completed this year, is to attempt to secure the pipe, as mentioned above, if at all possible. This well should certainly be completed as soon as possible as the present water supply at this School is almost depleted.\n\nIf the transfer of the pipe, as mentioned above, is possible we would be obliged if you would notify Rev. G. W. Fisher at Lac La Ronge School direct as the need for action is urgent and this would save several days in notifying him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Can.\nSeptember 4, 1937\n\nEX'D.\n\nSir:\n\nEnclosed is a copy of letter recently received from our Indian Agent at Leask, Saskatchewan.\n\nYou will note that it refers to 80 feet of 2\" pipe which he states is at Lac La Ronge, and is the property of Military District No.10.\n\nIf this pipe is not required by your Department you will note from the Agent's letter that it would assist us considerably if it were turned over to the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nI should appreciate your giving this matter your kind attention and advising me as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith further reference to our conversation while in Ottawa last month regarding the possibility of your Department making a grant for the building of an Engineer's residence at this school, and your desire that I write you further concerning this matter, I would like to submit the following information for your consideration.\n\nMr. Bulteel, our engineer, was married to a member of the school staff during the summer holidays, and with the consent of our Commission, for the present Mrs. Bulteel retains her position in the school. For this winter they occupy rooms in the school building, but they would like to have a house of their own next year. We would like to build a cottage for them as close to the school as possible.\n\nI am enclosing for your perusal a suggested plan for the proposed cottage. It is estimated that it will cost about $2,500 to build. I shall be glad if you will lay this matter before your Department with the request that the Department make a grant to cover the entire cost, or at least assume a substantial amount of the cost of the same.\n\nAs it is desired to build as early next summer as possible, it will be necessary to get out logs during the coming winter with which to make lumber locally, and also to have the necessary doors, windows, shingles, building paper, etc., shipped in over the winter trails. I shall be glad if you will let me know the Department's decision as soon as possible, so that I may make more specific estimates of the materials required. Supplies would have to leave Prince Albert not later than March 1st.\n\nTrusting the Department will be able help us in this matter,\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Feb. 19th, 1938\n\nI have heard the Lac la Ronge Mission sewer was something awful.\n\nI likely know the water all along the road to your place is not fit to use.\n\nMy place is getting bad too, sometimes there are decayed paper pieces in it.\n\nI am afraid, a possibility that an underground dirty sewer disposal here.\n\nI believe the law to pollute water especially near it. I would suggest that you have this evil removed.\n\nThere is really no need to have this sewer emptying into the river. Miss Held took samples of the water in the river and the reports showed that the water is very poor.\n\nIt seems to me that should the health of the people be harmed by something for which there is no remedy, it has got to be changed and now is the time.\n\nI am sure on relief and could do this work and save money.\n\nEnough and let me know (in writing) what you think. If you can not do much I will take care of it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n\"A. Vander-Kraft\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6316, file 656-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n2. On taking this matter up with Rev. G. Fisher, Principal of the All Saints' Mission, Lac la Ronge, Sask., he stated that he quite agreed with Mr. Vander-Kraft regarding the stench of the sewer.\n\n3. On checking the sewerage disposal system at the Mission I find that there are two underground tanks about fifty yards to the east of the school. One of these tanks draws all the waste materials from the toilets, basins and tubs. The second tank draws all the waters from the laundry. An overflow leads out of the second tank and goes to an approximate distance of forty yards from the lake shore. Tank number one overflows into tank number two - the liquids only leaving tank number one. Chemical treatment in this tank number one precipitates the solids. At the time of installation (sixteen years ago) there was a filter at the end of the overflow from the second tank but Rev. Fisher believes that this filter is now stopped and the liquids instead of filtering are coming through the top and on the surface of the ground. However, Rev. Fisher says it is impossible for any solids or paper to get into this overflow. No tank is bailed out twice.\n\n4. With further regard to this sewerage system, I am informed by Rev. Fisher that he is at present negotiating with the Indian Department with regard to having a new filter put in and possibly to have the overflow drain north into the muskeg instead of south towards the lake. Any expense incurred in this matter would be chargeable to the Indian Department and would not be a matter for relief work.\n\n5. With reference to the samples taken by Miss H. Resident Nurse, there were four samples taken, one from the Mission well, one from the natural reservoir dock (approx. 600 yds. from the Mission), one from the creek draining from the muskeg into the lake (approx. 1000 yds. from the Mission) and the fourth taken from the M.O.M. Police dock, (approx. 1100 yds. from the Mission). These samples all showed water unfit for human consumption unless boiled or chlorinated. A comment was made by the Department of Public Health, Regina, that these returns, that the samples should have been placed in sterilized containers obtainable from the Regina Laboratory. Sample number two from the creek (into which the sewerage would seep were it changed to other than muskeg) showed more unfit for human consumption than the other samples.\n\n6. On checking the place where this sewage flows on the surface of the ground, I have not been able to find any trace of solids or paper which might cause the stench.\n\n7. It is my belief that the waters are being polluted mostly by the various fish freights, live stock, dead fish, etc., and not in any other way. However, something must be done to stop the stench from the overflow as it is extremely nauseating at times.\n\n8. I have taken this matter up personally since receiving his letter and will come down and examine the sewerage system.\n\nVerry Poor Copy\nRe: Albert Vander-Kraft, Complaint of,\nLac la Ronge, Sask.\n\n9.

Principal Fisher, and dated Lac la Ronge, March 25th, he states that \"when the Indian Agent was here last month I talked over the question of hospital supplies with him, and I gave him a memorandum of our requirements in the form of a letter dated February 8th\". He states that Mr. Davis said he would see about these things, but nothing has been sent.\n\nA similar memorandum was given to Mr. Indian Agent on February 9th with regard to materials, etc., required to repair the School drain. The Principal stated that he pointed out to the Indian Agent the need of these repairs, and hoped that the materials required would be ordered in time to reach the School over the winter trail.\n\nAs neither the hospital supplies, nor the materials for the drain, appear to have been ordered, our Commission will be obliged if you will give the matter your immediate attention and either place the orders from Ottawa, or through your agent at Leask, or else authorize our Commission to do so.\n\nAs it may be now too late for the supplies and materials to be sent through from Prince Albert by surface transport I\nwould recommend that they be sent through by the M. & C.

Your letter 132-2-5.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of March 29th, and my reply of April 9th, I would say that I have thoroughly gone into the matter with our Engineer, of the improvements which might be effected in our sewage disposal system. We have come to the conclusion that since the septic tank is in good working order, and there is no blockage between it and the settling pool, the cause of the offensive odour complained of, must be due to the settling itself being clogged. We would suggest, therefore, that during the coming summer, the settling pool be dug out, cleaned, and reconstructed. If, as we anticipate, this pool is full of stones, it will entail considerable labour to carry out this work, and I would ask the Department to make a grant of $300.00 for labour, and for any necessary materials which may be required. It will be impossible to determine just what may be required until the digging is commenced.\n\nHowever, the suggestion made above would not do away with the overflow being discharged into the lake, and to avoid this it would be necessary to construct an entirely new system, and the direction of the discharge changed to run into the muskeg at the back of the school. This would necessitate the digging of a trench from eight to twenty feet deep, and about 600 ft long, in order to lay a new pipe system, and since the land through which this line would have to pass is full of boulders, it would entail a considerable amount of blasting and labour.\n\nSince it will be impossible to carry through such a project during the coming summer, owing to the excessive cost of freighting the materials that would be necessary, I would suggest that the Indian Agent be made to make a thorough survey when he visits the school about June 20th. My own impression is that such a change in the entire system could not be made for less than $2000.00.\nFor your information I would say that in the early part of 1935, because of a similar complaint to the one recently made, at the request of Indian Agent Davis, I submitted sketches of our sewage disposal system, which were sent to Department of Public Health, Regina. Some time after I received a letter from Mr. Davis outlining what should be done to keep the system running smoothly. These instructions have been faithfully carried out. At that time, the Department of Public Health apparently made no objections to the overflow being discharged into the Lake. I can assure you that it is my desire to do everything in my power to remove permanently any cause for further complaint.\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nMay 2, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to previous correspondence regarding the sewage system at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School I enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter which has just been received from the Principal.\n\nNo doubt you have already received, through Inspector Robertson's office, instructions to inspect the sanitary conditions at the Lac la Ronge School when you are making treaty payments. If you consider that the work suggested by the Principal in the first paragraph of his letter would better conditions you may authorize him to proceed on the understanding that the labour and materials will not exceed the amount of $300.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

This man should have plenty of time to dispose of the sewage.\n\nI am leaving for the North, on the Treaty Trip, on the 22nd of this month and any information or instructions that you could give me before leaving would be of great benefit in getting this matter settled.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Can.\nLeask, Sask.\nJune 4th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of May 2nd, file 132-2-5, in regard to the sewage system at the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School; I have inspected this system a number of times and have found that, owing to the formation of the ground in the locality of the school, I feel that it will be very difficult to ever make a sewage system work satisfactorily unless the first tank is sealed so that the overflow would not run into the second disposal tank which is about 100 yards away.\n\nThe formation of the land around the buildings is of rock and all the earth, or most of it, has been hauled for the garden.\n\nMr. Fisher suggested that another septic tank be built back in the muskeg, with an approximate cost of $2000.00, but I am of the opinion that the muskeg will also become polluted and the same condition will occur within a year or so and consequently the money would be wasted.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a rough sketch of the locations of the buildings and the tanks. I have marked thereon, in red ink, the ground that I believe has become over soaked. Perhaps this circle is a little large but it will give you some idea of the conditions. I have also marked, in red ink, the outlet on the first tank that, in my opinion, should be sealed.\n\nI have discussed the matter with Mr. Dempster, the Engineer at the P.A. National Park, and he could see no other solution and advised me to take the matter up with you and have you refer it to the Engineering Branch in Ottawa. If this proposal is adopted, it would be necessary to supply them with a tank in order to haul this refuse away from the school to a distance of about two miles from the buildings. A pump would also be required to pump out the first tank. The school have an engine that would be suitable for use on the pump.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant with further reference to the sewage system at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nThe suggestion contained in the fourth and fifth paragraphs of your letter appear to be practical and no doubt you will study the situation carefully when you reach the school.\n\nIf, after discussing the matter again with the Principal, you decide that your plan should be tried you should report fully to the Department following your return and at the same time give full particulars regarding the tank and pump that you would recommend be supplied. Purchase of same will have to be made through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nNo doubt you can make satisfactory arrangements with the Principal to have the farm instructor at the school give more attention to the sewage plant in future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nR.

The whole heating system is in bad condition and the plan of the building is such that if a fire broke out at night it would be impossible to get the children out. I had a fire drill, but it is hard to tell just what would happen in the case of a fire, as when I have fire drill it is more or less expected and everyone is ready so that things run smoothly. The fire hose was inspected and tested. I found 50 feet of 1\u00bd\" fire hose in bad shape which should be replaced at once and I am forwarding form 37 for this.\n\nSewage System\n\nI thoroughly discussed the sewage system with Rev. Fisher and I am at a loss to know what to do as I cannot see where a system could be built that will look after the requirements of an institution of this size owing to the location of the school. The school is built on land that is of heavy rock formation and is about 15 feet above the level of the lake. As near as I can see the outlet previously ran into the lake but the lake level is now low and this overflow runs on top of the ground and is causing a very bad smell with a tendency to cause fever. The people of the village object to this and also object very strongly to us running it into the lake as this is the water supply for the whole settlement. Nothing was said about the disposal going into the lake in years gone by as no one knew anything about it at that time. I am enclosing a blue print of the system so that you will be able to have the engineering branch look it over and see just what can be done.\n\nI previously recommended that this sewage be hauled away in a tank but on seeing the large amount of water that goes through this system, I believe that it would be impossible to do this unless a couple of men with tanks did nothing else.\n\nI would recommend that the Department send an engineer to this school to go into the whole thing as a large amount of money could be spent with no results being obtained. I am holding up any work until I am further advised by the department as the amount of $300.00 the department has allowed would not improve conditions.\n\nR. S. Davis.\nIndian Agent.\nLeask, Sask., July 12th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit herewith a report on the northern proportion of this agency.\n\nIndian Residential school, Lac La Ronge.\n\nThe school was inspected and conditions have improved a little in regards to the food for the children.\n\nThe children's dormitories should have screen windows, and as they have a handy man at the school, this work should have been done; it is impossible for the children to sleep at night with the mosquitos.\n\nThe lack of games for the children is a handicap to them; this phase of their education is very badly neglected. These children have no playground equipment with the exception of a baseball and a football and have not been taught how to get the best from these games.\n\nImprovement could be made in the laundry as very little care is taken in the manner in which the children's clothes are washed. The laundry maid will be changed and this difficulty will be overcome.\n\nR. S.

G.W. Fisher, Indian Residential School, Lac la Ronge, Sask., c/o M. & C. Aviation Co., Prince Albert, Sask., it appears that a larger size than required was sent by your firm to fill this order.\n\nThe Principal has sent a sample of the hose at present in use, and asks that hose of this size be supplied. I note that this sample is smaller than your standard 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" Underwriters linen fire hose, as it is about 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" in diameter.\n\nUnder the circumstances, will you please arrange to ship one fifty-foot length of the same size as the sample herewith with one set of shank L.P.T. couplings for same. In the meantime arrangements are being made to return to you the larger size hose and couplings already received, as per your invoice No. 9969 dated 3rd instant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.M. Bailey\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nMessrs. Chas. Neidner's Sons,\nCoaticook, P.Q.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle.\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal System, Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nAlthough as we advised in our memorandum of the 5th instant, it was understood that Mr. Dempster probably would not be able to make an inspection at the above school until later this fall we are now in receipt of a letter from him advising that he made a hurried trip by plane to Lac la Ronge on Thursday, the 3rd instant. Owing, however, to freezing conditions and the fact that the lakes might freeze overnight, he was only able to spend a portion of one day on making an inspection. For your information the following is quoted from Mr. Dempster's letter:\n\n\"I found that at present water was being pumped from a well, which, as near as I could make out, was being fed partially from the lake and partially from a small spring. Whereas there used to be from twelve to fourteen feet of water in this well, there is now only 4\u00bd feet; hence on wash days they cannot pump sufficient water for their needs.\n\n\"As I see it, the only solution is to sink a new well closer to the lake and install a pipe line out into the lake. I do not believe water will filter through the soil. It is necessary for me to go back and spend from three to four days going over and sounding the shore area for the water system and also going into the matter of sewage disposal. I will do this as soon as the in-between season is over. In the meantime I arranged with the mechanic in charge of their water system that, in the event of the well going dry, he could hook up a typhoon pump of capacity 2500 gallons per hour to a gasoline driven unit and pump from the lake into the well as the occasion demands. They were fortunate in having two pumps, one for the water system from the well and a spare pump. This spare pump could be enclosed in a small shelter right on the ice and, providing the suction and discharge lines, as well as the pump itself, were drained after using, no difficulty should be encountered in pumping even in the cold weather.\n\n\"In the short time I was there I gathered that the installation of a well with a pipe line would be an extremely costly proposition as it will be necessary to go out approximately 500 feet in the lake to obtain any depth of water. In the meantime, however, I do not believe in the meantime any difficulty will be experienced.\"\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6316, file 656-5, part 6)\nin supplying the school with water and upon my next visit I will obtain detailed information and prepare cost reports on both the water system and the sewage system.\"\n\nFrom the above it will be noted that Mr. Dempster cannot make a full report or definite recommendation until he has had an opportunity of spending more time investigating actual conditions at this school. However, it will be noted that apparently Mr. Dempster made sufficient arrangements with the mechanic in charge of the water system to assure that the school will be supplied with water for the present and possibly even for the winter months; and therefore, it would not appear that any action is necessary until Mr. Dempster has had an opportunity of making another visit to Lac la Rouge and obtaining sufficient information upon which to base a full recommendation and cost estimate.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT.S. Mills\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Sewage disposal system and water supply, Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nOur Engineer, Mr. Dempster, made a hurried trip by plane to Lac la Ronge on the 3rd instant and we have now received a report. A copy of the Chief Engineer's memorandum is attached covering Mr. Dempster's report from which it will be noted that arrangements have been made to supply water to the school if necessary from the lake by the use of an extra pump available at the school.\n\nMr. Dempster will make another trip into Lac la Ronge as soon as possible when a more complete report will be received and forwarded to you. In the meantime there should be no danger of the school suffering from scarcity of water.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nNovember 21, 1936.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Sewage disposal system and water supply, Lac la Ronge Residential School.\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of November 15 with reference to Mr. Dempster's recent visit to the Lac la Ronge school.\n\nIt is noted that arrangements have been made to supply water to the school if necessary from the lake by the use of an extra pump. I also note that Mr. Dempster will make another trip to Lac la Ronge as soon as possible.\n\nDirector.\n| NUMBER PKGS | DESCRIPTION                  | MARKS | WEIGHT | RATE | OUR CHARGES | ADVANCE CHARGES | TOTAL CHARGES |\n|-------------|------------------------------|-------|--------|------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|\n|             | Sales clothes                |       |        |      |             |                 |               |\n|             |                             |       |        |      |             |                 |               |\n|             |                             |       |        |      |             |                 |               |\n\nReceived above in good order\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hives, Principal of Shingwauk Home, and who was Principal of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School until 1929, visited the Department today and I discussed with him the difficulties that we are experiencing at Lac la Ronge. He gave me the following information:\n\n1. Mr. Hives states that there are very good pole fire escapes on the front of the Lac la Ronge school. He claims that the dormitory doors open directly on the upper verandah at either end of which brass poles lead to the ground. He further stated that when he was Principal it was found possible to empty the building within two minutes.\n\n2. While he was Principal he installed a septic tank which he states worked perfectly. There was only a very small discharge from this tank. It should, of course, be cleaned out at regular intervals. Possibly this has not been done.\n\n3. With regard to the water Mr. Hives felt that it would be inadvisable to attempt to run 500 feet of pipe into the lake. It would probably be a constant source of trouble. He believed that if more water was required it could be more easily obtained by drilling a well.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSOLD TO Department of Mines & Resources,\nRev. G.W.

This in Mr. Dempster's opinion would alleviate the situation for the time being until a new water system could be put into effect.\n\nMr. Dempster further suggests that the Principal of the School should be advised to send in water samples for analyses as often as possible and it may be even necessary to treat the water to ensure safe drinking. In connection with this latter point, however, Mr. Dempster states that the treating of the water will be difficult with the present system, but that in the proposed new system provision would have to be made for chlorination.\n\nWe, of course, have no fire pumps or hose in this vicinity, but possibly the Indian Affairs Department could make some arrangement in this connection.\n\nIt is suggested that instructions to the Principal of the School with reference to taking samples of the water, as well as possible chlorination, could be issued by the medical service of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.

However, these alterations will have to stand over until next season as equipment to excavate the trench in the lake bottom will not be available until then and it is not clear that funds have been provided in this year's vote. No water shortage should occur next winter as the school has been authorized to retain the fire pump and hose loaned by the National Parks Bureau until next spring.\n\nThe sewage disposal scheme has been discussed with the engineers of the Health Department who made certain suggestions including the elimination to the screen chamber as being unnecessary, substitution of one 4 inch syphon for the two 3 inch syphons shown on the plan and a reduction in the size of the septic tank, together with the use of reinforced instead of plain concrete. These suggestions will be taken up with Mr. Lazorka and if adopted will result in some reduction in the cost which was estimated to be about $3,800.00.\n\nKitchen and laundry waste will be disposed of through a drain to a swamp lying north of the school at an estimated cost of about $1,600.00.\n\nThese projects will also have to stand over until funds have been provided for their construction.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\nREPORT ON:\nWATER SUPPLY AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS,\nLAG LA RONGE, INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThe above school was visited on July 7th-10th and an inspection carried out together with the necessary surveys. I have prepared plans, compiled from information obtained, and am enclosing blueprints of these in conjunction with this report. The condition of the water supply and sewage disposal systems, at the time of my visit are summarized below:\n\nPRESENT WATER SUPPLY.\n\nGeneral:\n\nWater is pumped from a well located 186 feet away from the school by a Fairbanks Morse, 2,500 g.p.h. self-piling typhoon pump, driven by a 3 H.P. Fairbanks Morse gasoline engine. The pumping unit is located in the basement of the school. Water is pumped into two pressure tanks, each of approximately 660 gallons capacity, to a maximum pressure of 60 pounds per square inch, from where it is distributed throughout the school.\n\nSource of Supply:\n\nThe supply well is 18 feet deep, dug to solid rock. At the time of inspection there was 10 feet of water in the well. From levels obtained, the water level in the well was 3 feet above the Lake level, the latter being 83 feet away. In view of this fact it is evident that the source of supply is from springs and underground flow and not by infiltration from the Lake.\n\nI was informed that the supply was adequate this year, during the summer months, but that there was a shortage during winter months, as experienced in the past, due to the drop of water level in the well. The demand is far more important during the winter months, as the water consumption is greatest then, being 2,500 gallons daily on wash days; and the fire-hazard being at the maximum. The school, when occupied during fall, winter and spring has 125 occupants.\n\nFrom the above observations it is imperative that the lake be considered as a source of water supply, and proper water works constructed to bring water from the lake into the well, to assure an adequate supply at all times. A proposed scheme will be dealt with, in detail, later.\n\nQuality---\nQuality of Water Supply.\n\nI was informed by the principal of the school, Reverend G. W. Fisher that several samples of water were sent in for analysis, in 1936; but copies of these reports could not be located at the time. I asked him to have samples again taken this year, and supply me with copies. I have received these and am attaching copies, hereto. The sample from the well shows no B. Coli contamination, whereas the two samples of lake water show contamination.\n\nEven though, the sample from the well shows no B. Coli contamination, as per attached report, I was advised by Reverend Fisher that last year contamination had been reported.\n\nProbable Source of Contamination.\n\nIn view of the fact that the sewage flowing out of the Septic Tank follows a rock filled ditch, as shall be dealt with in more detail later, on the sewer system no doubt some of it seeps down and may be carried by underground flow into the well. Due to this fact, therefore, that there is a possibility of the water supply becoming contaminated by underground flow, or when the lake water is used for an additional supply, which shows contamination along the shore, even some distance away from the present sewer outfall, I would recommend installing a chlorinator for the purpose of treating the water supply.\n\nPRESENT SEWER SYSTEM.\n\nThe sewage from the school and the principals residence is discharged into a septic tank, 12 feet x 9 feet x 11 feet deep. This tank is divided into two compartments 6 feet long, each; one being a syphon chamber. The sewage is discharged from the syphon chamber into a pipe line, towards the lake. It was informed that only four lengths of soil pipe were laid leading out of the septic tank and the remainder of the discharge line into the lake was a 4 inch wooden box laid in a rock filled ditch. The wood box pipe has now rotted and the rock filled ditch serves the purpose of carrying away the effluent into the lake.\n\nA separate 4 inch discharge line from the laundry and kitchen was originally constructed, joining the rock filled ditch carrying the sewage, some distance down towards the lake. However this line became blocked in October, 1937, and the laundry and kitchen wastes were diverted into the sewer pipes, in the school basement, and passed through the septic tank, together with the sewage. This is still being done, at present.\n\nThis-----\nThis however, is a poor arrangement, as the laundry wastes should not be admitted into the septic tank. Furthermore this tank is located too high, and also due to its inadequate size, does not permit a long enough retention period for the sewage. The sewage is therefore discharged out of the septic tank, shortly after entering it.\n\nIn order to improve the sewage system, the present septic tank will have to be abandoned, and a new one together with a disposal field constructed.\n\nPROPOSED WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM.\n\nAt present the pumping unit is located in the basement of the school. This arrangement is very poor, as in case of a fire there would be no access to the pump. Furthermore this pumping unit being gasoline driven, and gasoline kept in a drum in the basement of this school increases the fire hazard. I would therefore recommend building a pump house over the present well, and moving the pumping unit to this location. In case of a fire, the pump could be operated as necessary to keep the pressure up in the pipelines for fire protection.\n\nSince the water supply is not adequate at certain times of the year as was pointed out, a pipeline will have to be laid into the lake, as shown on the enclosed plan, to ensure sufficient water at all times.\n\nI wish to point out at this stage, that the laying of the pipeline into the lake may present a problem. Since the lake bottom and the shoreline is underlain with huge rocks, driving a cofferdam, in order to excavate deep enough for the pipeline, is out of the question. I believe excavation between the well to reasonably close to the shoreline may be done by ordinary methods. However from there to stn. 4 plus 00 as shown on the plan would have to be excavated by a dragline.\n\nA dragline, owned by the Brooks Construction Company, Prince Albert, is now being used on the new road construction from Montreal Lake to Lac La Ronge. This dragline however, would not be available much earlier than the fall of 1946. By the present progress made on this road, it does not appear that the Lac La Ronge end would be reached till then. To bring in equipment other than this would be prohibitive as winter trails are passable. Then again no firm would bring their equipment in over the winter trails (when such freighting is possible) just for such a small job. It would therefore appear that the most economical method to do this excavation will be with this dragline, used on road construction, at such a time when it will be available.\n\nIn-----\nIn view of the fact that water samples have shown contamination, it will be necessary to install a chlorinator to ensure a safe water supply.\n\nThe following is an estimated cost of the proposed water system:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Dry excavation                            | 225.00 |\n| Wet                                       | 300.00 |\n| Back filling & Clay fill                  | 150.00 |\n| Rip-rap                                   | 50.00  |\n| Universal pipe & valve                    | 325.00 |\n| Freight from Prince Albert                | 115.00 |\n| @ $2.00 per 100 lbs.                      |        |\n| Laying pipe, etc.                         | 75.00  |\n| Galvanized pipe, fittings, etc.            | 175.00 |\n| Rock-filled crib in lake                  | 100.00 |\n| 12' x 6' x 6'                             |        |\n| Pump house 14' x 16'                      | 1000.00|\n| Moving pumping unit                       | 100.00 |\n| Chlorinator                               | 600.00 |\n| Contingencies 15%                         | 3193.00|\n| TOTAL                                     | 3671.95|\n\nPROPOSED SEWER SYSTEM\n\nThe present sewer system is in poor condition, being unsanitary as well as inadequate. The septic tank does not permit a long enough retention period, as pointed out before and the sewage passing into the ditch and eventually into the lake is practically raw. A new system will therefore be constructed.\n\nThe present discharge lines from the school and principal's residence will be diverted around the existing septic tank into the manhole. A new septic tank, located below the present one will receive sewage from a manhole as shown on the plan. The sewage after being discharged by the syphons, which are designed for 90 gallons per minute, will be distributed throughout the disposal field.\n5.\n\nThe following is an estimated cost of the proposed sewer system:\n\n- Septic tank $955.00\n- Pipeline including Manhole $696.00\n- Disposal field $1471.00\n\nContingencies 15% $3502.00\n\nTOTAL $3799.30\n\nPROPOSED LAUNDRY AND KITCHEN DRAIN\n\nIn order to dispose of the laundry and kitchen wastes, it will be possible to discharge these by a pipeline into a swamp along line \"B\" as indicated on the general plan.\n\nThe following is an estimated cost of the proposed laundry and kitchen drain:\n\n- Excavation $470.00\n- Backfilling and fill $350.00\n- Materials including pipe and plumbing $485.00\n- Manhole $35.00\n- Labour - laying pipe, etc. $75.00\n\nContingencies 15% $1415.00\n\nTOTAL $1627.25\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion I would say that any freighting in connection with this project, as bringing in materials, would have to be done during the winter, as no roads are passable in summer, and the new highway under construction would not be opened to public use for a few years. In view of the fact that the Lac La Ronge area has been set aside as a provincial Park by Saskatchewan, makes it all the more necessary to have the sewer system, in particular, sanitary, as objections to the present system would, no doubt, be stronger in the future.\n\n(sgd) D.

I could give you a great deal more help in the matter if I could talk it over with you. I mean, there is so much connected with conditions at Lac la Ronge, and of which I am familiar, that I can see a great deal of extravagant figuring in the estimates. I will go over the matter carefully, but if you would like me to go up to see you, I could do so next Thursday. Nine thousand dollars seems, and is a lot of money, especially when the system has been running fairly well for nearly twenty years, and was installed at very little cost to the Department in the first place, and would continue to function fairly well if it had been taken care of, and not be subject to the schemings of people who think they will soak the Government for something.\n\nPlease let me know as soon as possible if you would like me to talk the whole matter over with you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr R.A.

In his last paragraph Mr. Lazorka stated that it would be necessary to have the material transported during the winter. It may be that you have given this matter full consideration and have decided against purchasing this year, or that no funds are available for the purchases. If, however, it is desired to have the systems installed next summer purchases will have to be made at once in order to have the material transported to the school this winter.\n\nThe matter is now being brought to your attention in order that whatever is decided upon may be done before spring.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nDecember 29, 1939.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Sewage disposal and water supply, Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your memoranda of October 3 and December 28 in connection with the above.\n\nVery careful consideration was given to the contents of your memorandum of October 3 but when preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1940-41 specific directions were received to the effect that the total amount should not exceed the amount provided in the current fiscal year. As a result it was impossible for this Branch to consider the very large expenditure that would be necessary in order to install a new sewage disposal and water supply system at the Lac la Ronge School during the summer of 1940. Under these circumstances no further action can be taken in this matter at the present time.\n\nActing Director.\nForward from Sheet No. 8\n\nNew fence at The Ahtahkakoops Indian Day School\nMaterials 40.00\nLabour 25.00 65.00\n\nNew fence at the Sturgeon Lake Day School\nMaterials 40.00\nLabour 25.00 65.00\n\nNew furnace at the Little Red River Day School.

At the present time there is a day school at Stanley but it is in very poor condition and if this school is to be kept open for the regular term as it was last year then a new school must be provided. The estimate for Sucker River and Fisher River Schools was included at the request of the Inspector. I would strongly recommend that they be built. At each of these points residences must be provided for the teacher. The estimate for Chitek Lake School was also requested by the Inspector. This school will be of logs construction but should contain a basement and therefore will cost more than the ones mentioned above.\n\nParticular attention is called to the shipping instructions contained in the requisitions for the schools and residences at Stanley, Sucker River and Fisher River. These supplies must go in by winter freight in January if the buildings are to be erected.\n\nAgent.\nMr. R. S. Davis,\nThe Indian Agency, Leask,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a list of the essential needs to be asked for from the Department for this school for the coming year. I would ask you to do your best to obtain these things for us. I would call your attention specially to the following:\n\n1. The belts for the Lighting Plant.\n2. The Furnace Repairs all of which are very necessary as you yourself know.\n3. The School Bell - which is badly cracked, and is getting worse all the time. I feel this should be replaced as soon as possible, for the present bell is not a very effective outside fire alarm, for in its present condition its sound does not carry very far. In fact it cannot be heard within the building.\n4. Lumber for the replacement of Laundry, Drying Room, and Boys' Sewing Room Floors, which need to be replaced very badly. In this case I have estimated the cost based on local costs of manufacture, and in this item, I would ask for a cash grant for the purpose.\n5. Typewriter.

G.W. Fisher, Principal of our Lac-la-Ronge, Indian School, submitted to Mr Indian Agent Davis, a list of the requirements of his School for 1940.\n\nIncluded in the list were two High Speed heavy leather belts. One 34\"x6\" and the other 34\"x4\". We are now in receipt of a letter from Mr Fisher, reporting that the electric generator drive belt had broken and should be repaired immediately. It has been patched, by the Engineer, so that it can be used, but will not last long.\n\nMay the Commission, therefore, be authorised to place an order, at once, for:\n\n1 only High Speed heavy endless leather belt 35'6\"x4\"\nand 1 \" \" \" \" \" leather belt (not endless)34'6\" x 5\"\n\nIt will be noted that the measurements as stated on the original list have been changed, but the sizes, now given, are correct.\n\nIf the purchase, of the belts can be authorised at once the Commission will undertake to send them forward and later send receipted accounts, in triplicate, to your Department. Mr Fisher also requests that, as many of the items are urgently required, the entire shipment may be authorised, and sent forward, during the present freighting season.\n\nAs all freighting from Prince Albert, to Lac-la-Ronge has to be done by sleigh it will be necessary for all supplies to leave the former point by the middle of March, at the latest.\n\nTrusting that you will be able to give favourable consideration to this request.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary-Treasurer,\nIndian & Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM.S.C.C.\nCopy sent to Mr. Hamilton.\n\nOttawa,\nFebruary 15, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to supplies and materials requested by the Principal of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nSome of the articles requested by the Principal are not usually supplied by the Department and consequently no authority can be given for their purchase.\n\nI note that you wish to make certain that all the articles that the Department is supplying will reach Prince Albert before the middle of March so that they may be taken to the school by winter freight.

It also means we have no reserve for fire protection. For the past month we have been working under such conditions. To-day I had to have the boys carry water from the lake in order to wash the dishes after the noon-day meal.\n\nIt is true that the Department made arrangements with the Dominion Parks Branch to loan an engine and pump, (of the fire-fighting type) so that we might pump water from the lake into the well, but we cannot use it in sub-zero weather.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Davis was here several weeks ago, and I reported the matter to him, and he promised to ask the Department to supply sufficient 2\" pipe to carry a suggestion by which we could use our spare pump for pumping water from the lake into the well. So far, I have had no further word from him.\n\nLast July, Mr. Lazorka, an engineer sent in by the Department, made a complete survey of our sewage and water systems, and of course, reported to the Department. I am wondering whether it is the intention of the Department to do anything to remedy the situation during the coming summer?\nWithout financial backing from the Department, I feel it is impossible for us to do very much. In 1937, the sum of $150.00 was given us for deepening the well. We did the best we could, and were able to go down several feet deeper, but further digging was impossible when we reached bed rock. We tried dynamiting but without any success. Do you think it would be possible to persuade the Department to send in a well-boring outfit, and either deepen our present well, or give us an entirely new one?\n\nI shall be glad if you will write to the Department regarding this matter, so that we may know whether we may expect anything to be done during the coming summer.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) G.W. Fisher,\nPrincipal.\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIt will be appreciated if you will give your personal attention to the question of an adequate water supply for our Lac la Ronge School, as mentioned in the attached letter from the Rev. Principal Fisher. As you will have on file the report of the engineer mentioned in the Principal's letter, I do not consider it necessary to offer any suggestions in connexion with the matter. It is, however, an urgent matter, and steps should be taken with the least possible delay to have it dealt with effectively.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/WH\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa,\nApril 13, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant enclosing copy of letter received from the Principal of the Lac la Ronge Residential School in connection with the water supply.\n\nI note that Rev. Mr. Fisher refers in his communication to pipe that he requires. In this regard I may say that Indian Agent Davis was authorized on February 24 to purchase and ship to the school 300 feet of 2 inch pipe, also drain lock, valve, pipes and elbows.\n\nAn engineer of the Surveys & Engineering Branch visited the school in September, 1939, and estimated that the cost of a new water system, a new sewage system and a drain from the laundry and kitchen would cost approximately $9000.00. It is impossible to consider providing this amount of money in the current year's appropriation and at the present time I am unable to state when funds will be available for the extensive improvements that the engineer considered might be provided.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

By arrangement with the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch the loan of this equipment was extended over the winter months. Towards the end of April last, in view of the serious forest fire hazard in Prince Albert National Park, this equipment was recalled.\n\nOn the receipt of the equipment by the Park Superintendent, he reported that it was in very poor condition and that considerable repairs were necessary before it could be operated. When the pump was loaned early the summer of 1939, it was on the understanding that it would be returned in first class condition.\n\nThe National Parks Bureau have now had the pump repaired and have submitted two accounts covering repairs in the amounts of $49.08 and $20.25. The Director of the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch has asked if we could arrange payment of these accounts by the Indian Affairs Branch, in accordance with the understanding when the pump was loaned. The accounts are enclosed herewith and I would be glad if you would give consideration to paying them.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, June 25, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has been requested to pay an amount of $69.33 for repairs to the fire pump and hose loaned to the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School by the authorities of the Prince Albert National Park.\n\nWe are advised that when the equipment was returned to the Park Superintendent it was in very poor condition and that these repairs were necessary before it could be operated. It was stated further that when the pump was loaned to the school, early in the summer of 1938, it was on the understanding that it would be returned in first class condition.\n\nIn a letter dated February 26, 1940, addressed to the Secretary of the M. S. C. C., the Principal of the Lac la Ronge Residential School wrote in part as follows:\n\n\"It is true that the Department made arrangements with the Dominion Parks Branch to loan an engine and pump, of the fire-fighting type, so that we might pump water from the lake into the well, but we cannot use it in sub-zero weather\".\n\nIt would appear from the above that the pump was not used to any great extent, and if it was properly stored, it is difficult to understand why its condition should have deteriorated to the extent of requiring repairs -\n\nMr. R.

Fisher, Principal,\nLac la Ronge School.\nrepairs to the amount mentioned above.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to the Principal of the Lac la Ronge School, and it would be appreciated if both the Principal and yourself would submit a report to the Department regarding the condition of the pump and hose at the time it reached the school, also what use was made of it and any conditions that arose that might have caused the damage for which we are requested to pay.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nLeask, Sask.,\nJuly 5th 1940.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter 132-2-5 dated June 25th, regarding pump loaned to Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School; I was under the impression when the pump was loaned to the Lac La Ronge School, it was in first class condition, but having spoken to the engineer last winter, he informed me that the pump was in poor condition and would now need repairs.\n\nThis account should be paid by the M.S.C.C. as they have an engineer on their staff to look after these things and apparently this engine has been neglected.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs.

The magneto always gave trouble with oil getting in after being run for an hour.\n\nJ.H. Bullet.\n\n(School Engineer)\nPhilip Phelan Esq.,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received the copy of your letter of June 25th, addressed to Mr. R. S. Davis, Leask, Sask., with reference to the pump and hose loaned to this school by the authorities of the Prince Albert National Park.\n\nAfter its arrival at the school the care of this pump was turned over to the care of the School Engineer, and I personally had nothing to do with the handling of it. As far as I remember, until last winter when we tried to pump water into the school well from the lake, the pump was used but twice, when I gave permission for its use to extinguish two bush fires, which started up within a quarter of a mile from the school, and which at the time appeared to be a menace to the school property.\n\nAt the beginning of November after running for a short time, the pump broke down, and on November 20th, I wrote to the Superintendent of the Prince Albert National Parks, sending him the parts which were broken. He at once replied, sending at the same time the necessary repairs, which our Engineer installed. After this, so far as I know, the engine and pump worked all right, save as indicated in the brief report attached. The only thing I can suggest is that more damage was done when the pump broke down in November than was thought at the time.\n\nI am sorry that this pump needed so many repairs; for I thought when it left here it was in good condition.\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fisher, Principal, Indian Residential School, Lac la Ronge, Sask., visited the Department on July 29 and we discussed the water situation at the school.\n\nMr. Fisher pointed out that at the present time the water level in the lake is at the lowest point that it has ever reached. As a consequence it was necessary to extend the pipe line. The necessary pipe for this purpose was supplied by this Branch early in the spring and has been installed.\n\nMr. Fisher understood that owing to present conditions it was impossible for the Department to consider the expenditure that would be necessary to carry out the proposal outlined in the report submitted by the engineer some months ago. However, Mr. Fisher stated that a coffer-dam to protect the pipe line would be of material assistance and he stated that if he could be allowed an amount of $250.00 for labour he felt that he could make a suitable installation. As this amount of money was still available in our appropriation from the amount provided in the current year's estimates for the Lac la Ronge School official letter of July 30 was forwarded to him.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nCopy sent to Mr. Davis\n\nOttawa,\nJuly 30, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your visit to the office yesterday in connection with matters at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School it has been decided to allow you an amount not exceeding $250.00 for erecting a soffer-dam to protect the water supply during the winter.

So I decided to dig a new well near the lake shore. I trust the Department will approve my action in this matter.\n\nI am glad to say, that while we could dig the well as deep as I would have liked to do, owing the fact that we struck bed rock at a depth of about ten feet, we have a well which at present is yielding an adequate supply of water. I am hoping the question of supplying water for the school has been solved.\n\nThe total cost of labour amounted to $156.00. I personally advanced this sum, and I shall be glad to have the Department's cheque for this amount at the earliest convenience.\n\nI am enclosing a rough sketch of the work done. I believe the well and pipe line is adequately protected against frost and there should be no difficulty on this score. But it will be necessary, in order to make the work permanent, to build a concrete wall on the outside of the mill-slab wall filled with shavings and earth, in order that it may not be washed away when the Lake returns to its former level. I am wondering whether\nthe Department will allow me to use the balance of the grant already made, amounting to $96.00 for this purpose. My understanding is that the grant was made for labour only, and since to carry out the additional work will involve expenditure for cement, I would ask for authority to buy the necessary cement, which can be shipped in during the coming winter for use in the Spring.\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nVoucher No. Date\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. William Bear, Box 572, Prince Albert, Sask. Mr. Bear would take direct delivery of the cement if notified. He is our official school freighter.\n\nI would like to ask for an additional $25.00 for the hire of labourers to assist in the work of putting up the wall. Part of the work will be done by the school staff and boys, but we have not enough big boys for this job. May I assure you of my desire and purpose to keep the expense as low as possible.\n\nYou will be glad to know that for the first time in four years we have had an adequate supply of water during the winter months, and I trust we have now solved our\nwater supply problem.\n\nThanking you for your co-operation in this matter,\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6316)\n\nFile 656-5, part 3\nCarlton Agency - Lac La Ronge Day School\n- Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1923 - 1926\n\nFile 656-5, part 4\nCarlton Agency - Lac La Ronge Day School\n- Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1926 - 1931\n\nFile 656-5, part 5\nCarlton Agency - Lac La Ronge Day School\n- Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1931 - 1938\n\nFile 656-5, part 6\nCarlton Agency - Lac La Ronge Day School\n- Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts (Plans). 1938 - 1941\n\nFile 656-5, part 7\nCarlton Agency - Lac La Ronge Day School\n- Building Maintenance - Supplies - Accounts - Destruction by fire. 1941 - 1947\n| CENTRAL REGISTRY | REFERRED TO | DATE REC'D | INITIALS | CENTRAL REGISTRY | REFERRED TO | DATE REC'D | INITIALS |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|----------|-----------------|-------------|------------|----------|\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. C.W. Fisher,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nLac la Ronge, Sask.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe: Lac la Ronge C. of E.\nIndian Residential School\n\nI have just received a Departmental letter dated August 14, 1941, No. 131-2-5, embodying part of a special report on our Lac la Ronge School which had been forwarded by Mr. Indian Agent Davis, and in which he makes special reference to (a) the lack of proper fire escapes, and (b) the need of more organized sport and vocational training.\n\nRe the fire escapes, I note the following item in the list of requirements submitted to your Department on Oct. 3, 1936:-\n\n\"(E) Fire Escapes. Only sliding poles are in use at present, and the Principal fears that in sub-zero weather these might not serve the purpose for which they were intended. He suggests that chutes or some better system be provided.\"\n\nWith regard to the Indian Agent's statement that the main school building, in his opinion, \"is nothing more or less than a fire trap\", I would point out that a new chimney from the furnaces was built in 1933, and when I visited this School in June, 1934, I was able to report that I considered \"the workmanship expert\".\n\nAt that time I thought that the chimney from the Laundry was unsafe, and gave instructions for a new one to be built at once. In this way we endeavoured to eliminate danger from fire from these sources.\n\nI found that only a gong was being used as a fire alarm, and since then an electric fire alarm system has been installed. This School, as you may know, has sliding poles for fire escapes, and when I sounded the fire alarm the School was cleared in 3 minutes.\nThis School was again visited by the Commission's Assistant Secretary-Treasurer, Colonel Mermagen, in 1935, and when he sounded the fire alarm early one morning, without giving any previous notice except to the Principal, he found that the School was cleared in approximately one minute. He refers in his report on this visit to suggestions he had made re the catch on the door leading to the verandah, where the poles are installed; re wiping the poles from time to time with rags soaked in coal oil so as to prevent rust, and re the arrangement of the clothing which each child should pick up when the alarm sounded, etc.\n\nIn the list of requirements submitted on Oct. 2, 1940, I find the following items included for this School:\n\n(a) 2 - 50 ft. lengths of 1\u00bd\" Underwriter's Fire Hose (canvas) complete with couplings 1\u00bd\" thread ...... $14.00\n\n(b) 2 only Pump type Pyrene Fire Extinguishers, 1 quart size ...................... 65.00\n\n(c) 2 only \"Guardane\" Fire Extinguishers, 2\u00bd gals..... 80.00 (?)\n\n$ 159.00\n\nFrom this it is quite clear that our Commission has taken all the steps within their power to secure the safety of this building from fire, and I was surprised to find, in Departmental letter, Aug. 12, 1941, No. 150-53, that no provision is being made for a Night Watchman's services in this and six of our other Schools this year. I have already directed Dr. McGill's attention to this omission.\n\nWith regard to the other items, namely organized sport and vocational training, anyone who has ever visited at Lac la Ronge and noted the rocky nature of the spot on which the School stands, and of the surrounding area, will realize how difficult it is to secure suitable playing fields.\n\nFor some years our Commission has recommended to your Department that buildings or space be set aside for vocational training, but so far no such facilities have been supplied. There is a saw and planing mill at Lac la Ronge, and this has been used to some extent I know, but cannot say whether full use has been made of it or not. I can assure you that our Commission and our Society keenly desire to cooperate with your Department in the matter of vocational training, but the heavy cuts made in our grants from 1932 and continued for several years, with a resultant loss to us in per capita grants of approximately $142,000.00, and your Department's decision last year to reduce the pupilage to 92.24%, have made it absolutely impossible for us to undertake many of the repairs and improvements we heartily desire.\n\nI note that a letter has been sent direct to the Principal advising him that the sum of $700. will be available during the current fiscal year for repairs and improvements and I am asking him to furnish me with a copy of his reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\n**RETURN OF LABOUR - ALL SAINTS SCHOOL**\n\n**LAC LA RONGE, SASK.**\n\n**Project - School Well**\n\n| Date   | Labourer       | Rate/dy. | Payable |\n|--------|----------------|----------|---------|\n| July 28| Benjamin Roberts | 1 dy. @ $2.00 | $2.00   |\n| Aug. 5-9| B.

I heartily agree that such improvement is necessary. There has not been time to prepare a detailed plan for this improvement, but the matter will be dealt with at once, and the plan mailed to Department not later than September 4th.\n\nI trust this delay of a few days, will not put the Department to any inconvenience.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nThe Chief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of August 14th., #132-2-5, and my reply to same of August 28th., with reference to providing additional fire escapes at the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School, in this connection I would make the following recommendations:\n\n(1) That the sliding poles at present in use be allowed to remain in their present positions.\n\n(2) That metal fire escapes of the stair type be provided for the lower Boys' and Girls' Dormitories. I am enclosing a rough sketch of the positions of the windows. Both ends of the building are identical, and in providing the necessary escapes, the difference would be that one would require a right hand, and the other a left hand railing.\n\n(3) Re. the upper (attic) dormitory occupied by the senior girls, I would recommend that an escape of wooden construction be renewed, on a rather different plan. I am not submitting a plan for this, as I have found it difficult to draw a plan which will show exactly what I think is required. But I feel sure that I could have constructed an efficient and safe escape (as far as wooden construction can be made safe) for the sum of $60.00. If the Department will authorise the expenditure of this amount for the purpose mentioned, construction could be begun at once.\n\nAs I do not know the cost of the metal fire escapes, it will not be possible for me to make suggestions as to the use that can be made of the balance of the $700.00 allotted to this school, until the cost of escapes is determined.\n\nI would, however, be glad if the Department will supply\nwith the fire protection supplies asked for in the estimates sent in during the fall of 1940. These were:\n\n2 only -50ft lengths of 1\u00bd\" Underwriter's Fire hose (canvas) complete with couplings 1\u00bd\" thread $14.00\n2 only Pump type Pyrene Fire Extinguishers\n   1 qt. size 65.00\n2 only \"Guardene\" Fire Extinguishers, 2\u00bd gals. 80.00(?)\n\nI trust that the suggestions made in this letter will meet the approval of the Department, and that the additional escapes to be provided will prove sufficient in case of emergency.\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nSeptember 17, 1941\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE: 78\n\nSHIP TO: Rev.

I realize that they are not as safe as the metal fire escapes but under present conditions it is the best we can do.\n\nAn expenditure of $60.00 for the erection of a wooden fire escape to the upper dormitory is also approved.\n\nI note that you want two 50 ft. lengths of hose and that you estimate its cost at $14.00. We always have considerable difficulty in purchasing hose due to the fact that more detailed information is required than is supplied in your letter. You may, therefore, arrange for the purchase of the hose.\n\nOur Purchasing Branch is being requested to secure the four fire extinguishers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. G.W.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nIn your letter of June 30th last #160-2, you informed me that the sum of $700.00 was available during the current fiscal year for repairs and equipment at our Lac la Ronge School. In a letter received this morning from the Reverend Principal Fisher, and written on the 17th inst., he states that you have already forwarded to him an accountable cheque for $200.00 for the building of fire escapes. It would appear from his letter that shipment of the material required for those fire escapes could not be secured last Fall, and consequently they are not completed. He intimates that he may not be able to complete them properly until the warmer weather comes, and as the work will be done without further labor costs he will be able to make an accounting to you of that $200.00 before the end of March.\n\nWith the balance of the $700.00 grant, namely $500.00, he desires to purchase the items given on the enclosed list.\n\nAs it is expected that your Purchasing Branch will place the order for the various items, I beg to suggest that an exception be made in the case of the fir flooring, and that the Reverend Principal Fisher be allowed to place an order for this with the North Star Lumber Company of Prince Albert. It appears that this Company when filling an order for Stanley, which is further north than Lac la Ronge, sent a thousand feet of lumber flooring more than was required, and they have offered to deliver this flooring to Lac la Ronge at Prince Albert price.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTRW: A.\nEnc.\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Las la Ronge Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 10-691\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received your letter of April 4th, and am surprised to learn that the cheque for $60.15 sent to you on March 27th, has not been received.\n\nI have looked up the stub of my cheque book, and find that I issued a cheque made out to the \"Receiver General Ottawa,\" on the above mentioned date. I am writing to my bank about the matter, to find out if per chance it has been received by them. Should neither the Department nor the Bank be able to trace it within a reasonable time, I shall be only too glad to issue a duplicate cheque.\n\nRe the missing receipts: I am sending herewith duplicate copy from my files of that from the Prince Albert Mfg. Co. for $2.46, and receipted bill from Brooks Construction Limited for $4.83. I trust that the receipts will now be in order.\n\nI regret that I have caused the Department so much trouble and delay in this matter, and sincerely hope that the missing cheque may be found.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI regret that I have been unable to send you an accounting for the cheque received for the erection of additional fire-escapes at this school, until this late date.\n\nThe delay was caused chiefly by the failure of certain materials, ordered last fall, and for which arrangements had been made for immediate delivery, not arriving until a few weeks ago. Then, when delivery was made, it was found that a mistake had been made in the number of door-casings shipped, making it necessary to order an additional one.\n\nI have also had difficulty in obtaining bills for freighting of materials from the Brook's Transportation Co., I had to write twice asking for it. The bill finally came on March 19th, whereupon I immediately mailed a cheque for the amount due, but owing to faulty mail service my cheque is still lying in the local post office.\n\nThe earliest I can expect to receive the receipted bills is April 2nd. This being the case I am forwarding a statement minus this receipt - shown under date of March 20th. It will be sent immediately I receive it.\n\nI trust this will be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nEnclosed find cheque for balance due to the Department amounting to $60.03\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nCREDIT MEMORANDUM\n\nReceived APR 1 1942\n\nDeposited\n\nEntered in Official Cash Book \u2014 Folio 3\n\nTreasury Office Receipt No. 4349\n\nPayer: W.

No doubt if you will explain this matter to Bradbury's Hardware they will refund the amount of the tax, $1.00, to you. Under any circumstances, it will be necessary for you to remit to this Branch an additional $1.00 to fully account for the original advance.\n\nI trust this matter will have your immediate attention as we are anxious to have your account in balance before closing the books at the end of the present month.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nL.W.

Bear, Prince Albert.\n\nI am also enclosing a bill as from the Northern Cartage and Contracting Company, Prince Albert, for cartage and storage charges on the supplies shipped by the Department. This Company handles all supplies in transit to the school. Will you kindly send a cheque the amount due direct to the Company.\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nMarch 24, 1943.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI desire to refer to our purchase order No. 15148 of November 2, 1942, and your invoice No. 10312 of November 12 in connection with a set of batteries forwarded to Rev. G.W. Fisher, Principal, Indian Residential School, Lac la Ronge, via Prince Albert, Sask. I am today in receipt of a letter from the Principal which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"It is also regretted that one box containing two battery cells had been allowed to fall in transit, on the last stage of the journey between Montreal Lake and Lac la Ronge. The box was broken, but the cells are apparently in good condition, save that the positive pole on one cell was broken off. It is my opinion that this pole connection post can be replaced by the manufacturers. I shall be obliged if the Department will make enquiries regarding this.\"\n\nIf you can supply the pole connection post, it would be appreciated if you would forward it to the Principal and at the same time attach your account covering its cost, so that he may certify it and return it to this office for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

G. W. Fisher of Lac la Ronge.\n\nWe could supply a new post but we are wondering if any lead welding or lead burning equipment is available at the Indian School to make the necessary repairs. We might advise that soldering is not recommended for the reason that solder contains considerable tin contents which is readily attacked by the acid fumes emitted from the battery.

In the meantime, while this cell was away, the lighting plant could be operated with the remaining 15 cells without very much inconvenience.

The building is not the least modern. Fire escapes are placed at what I consider the most strategic points but fire alarms and equipment are neither new nor modern. However, when tested were found to work satisfactorily. Fire drill is well carried out. During the past year the school was understaffed, but I consider the results obtained in spite of the handicaps are as good as elsewhere. This school definitely has a purpose to serve in the North.\n\nE.S. Jones,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Indian Residential School\nLac La Ronge, Sask.\nOctober 5, 1944.\n\nE. S. Jones Esq.,\nThe Indian Agent,\nLEASK, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received a letter from Dr. Alderwood telling me that in a letter dated September 25th, 1944 #150-53 from the Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, provision has been made for the payment of a grant for the Night-watchman at this school for five months at the rate of $35.00 per month.\n\nAt the present time wages for labour of any kind is quite high at Lac La Ronge, chiefly because of the higher prices paid for fur and fish. Unskilled labourers ask for at least $3.50 per day. Last year our Night Watchman received $40.00 per month with board and lodging. This year he is asking to be paid at the rate of $2.00 per night. He is on duty from 6.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. He is thoroughly reliable, and I know of no one else who will fill the position as well.\n\nLast year, through your recommendation, the Department increased the monthly grant to $40.00 per month, and I am wondering whether you could arrange for a similar or larger increase for the coming winter. If you are able to do this, it will be very much appreciated.\n\nWith kind regards,\nYours faithfully,\n\nG. W. Fisher\nPrincipal.\nLeask, Sask.\nOctober 20, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter received from the Rev. G. W. Fisher, Principal of the Indian Residential School at Lac La Ronge. When at Lac La Ronge recently, Mr. Fisher brought this matter up and I find it will be impossible to hire a night-watchman at a wage under $2.00 per night. Will the Department, therefore, give consideration to the request in Rev. Fisher's letter?\n\nH. S. Jones\nIndian Agent.\n\nESJ/AE\nOttawa,\nOctober 26, 1944.\n\nMr. E.S. Jones, Indian Agent, Leask, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, the Department will allow an amount of $40 a month toward the salary of the night watchman at the Lac la Ronge School for the five-month period he is employed during the winter of 1944-45.\n\nR.A.

Will kindly sign same and forward to Ottawa for payment.\n\nOwing to the high wages prevalent here this year we have had to pay our Nightwatchman at the rate of $60.00 per month. Do you think the Department would further increase its grant for the salary of our Nightwatchman? If it could be done, it would greatly help us.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, January 25, 1945.\n\nMr. E. S. Jones, Indian Agent, Leask, Sask.\n\nI am returning, unpaid, your voucher No. 524.\n\nUpon receipt of your letter of October 20, 1944, careful consideration was given to your suggestion that the amount allowed for night watchman's services at the Lac la Ronge School be increased. However, provision was made in the current year's appropriation for an amount of $40.00 a month only for the winter of 1944-45, and this is the average amount allowed to other Indian residential schools. It is considered a fair allowance towards the cost of employing a night watchman. Any amount required above this will have to be provided by the school concerned. Under the circumstances it is not possible to increase our allowance beyond $40.00 a month, and you should submit a voucher for this amount.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, January 25, 1945.\n\nMr. E.

Bryce,\nThe Indian Agency,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Bryce:\n\nYou will remember that when you were here at Treaty time, I pointed out to you that I found it very hard to use the grants given each year by the Department for equipment and repairs to the best advantage, due to the fact that such grants have to be used before March 31st, of the fiscal in which they are granted; whereas, in the matter of actual repair work, such as the laying of floors, painting, etc., it is best to do the work during the summer vacation, when most of the children are away for their holidays. At that time of the year it is not known just what grant will be available.\n\nWith the grant made last year, I endeavoured to buy things I thought were necessary for the improvement of the school, but much to my regret, some of the things were evidently unobtainable, or in some cases things costing much less than those asked for were substituted, with the result that during the year 1944-45, this school did not get the benefit of the full grant made.\n\nSince the First of June, mostly, since school closed for the holidays, we have been doing a considerable amount of work on the school, laying new floors and painting. I have had several men engaged, and have or will be paying out the following sums of money for wages:\n\nTo - A. VanderKracht .................. $41.30\n\" - H. Hegland ......................... 96.60\n\" - H. Charles ......................... 60.00\n\" - N. Irving ......................... 20.00\n\n$217.90\n\nOn April 19th, I paid to A. VanderKracht the sum of $91.12\non account wages for labour - repairs on school, making a total $309.02 during the present year.\n\nIf it had been permissible to have retained some of last year's grant after March 31st, part of these labours costs could have been met out of the 1944-45 grant. These costs are at present being borne our regular per capita grants, which we can ill afford to do, and for this reason I write to ask whether you will recommend that a special grant for labour of at least $250.00, and if possible of $300.00 be made by the Department for immediate use in covering some of the costs already incurred, and of those necessary to put the school in a better state of repair.\n\nIn addition to the amounts already expended, it will be necessary to spend at least $50.00 in order to put our heating system in a good state of repair before the coming winter.\n\nIf the Department could send me an accountable cheque for $250.00 to $300.00, I shall be pleased to send vouchers showing the manner in which the money is expended.\n\nIn the course of a few days I shall be sending you the usual list of requirements from the Department for this school for the fiscal year 1945-46.\n\nTrusting you may be able to persuade the Department of the necessity of providing additional help in putting our building a better state of repair,\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter from Rev. G.W. Fisher, the principal at Lac La Ronge Residential School in connection with repairs to the building and the granting of an advance to look after wages, etc., for your attention.\n\nJ.

We have on file a copy of his letter to Mr. James Bryce, acting Indian Agent, dated September 24th, in which a list of desired items totalling $1275.00 is attached. I presume that Mr. Fisher referred to these requests and as we have no information in the matter I shall be glad to know what is possible, so that the details may be passed on to our Principal.\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A. Alderwood\nSecretary.\nOttawa, 28th January, 1946.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant in connection with the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School. In the current year's appropriation we had an amount of $700.00 for repairs and improvements at this school. I find that we have spent approximately $500.00. Of this amount, $200.00 was expended in purchasing certain supplies requested and $300.00 was sent to Acting Indian Agent Bryce on the 6th September to pay for labour for repairs to the school.\n\nThe present fiscal year ends 31st March and if there is any additional expenditure which is absolutely essential and that can be handled between now and March 31st, I would be glad to hear from you. The amount available would be approximately $200.00 to $250.00.\n\nI have not been able to locate the letter of September 24th to which you refer, however, I presume that the expenditures requested in that letter were intended for the fiscal year 1946-47 which commences on April 1st, 1946. I suggest the Principal forward another letter to Acting Indian Agent Bryce giving detailed information regarding what he requires for the coming fiscal year and arrange to have this letter reach this office about April 1st. Careful consideration will be given to his requests.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. H.A.

G. W. Fisher, Principal of the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School in connection with the cost of the installation of toilets at the Indian School at Lac La Ronge. He referred me to William George & Co., Plumbers etc., Prince Albert and a copy of their letter is attached hereto.\n\nIt would appear that unless we are prepared to go to considerable expense we will be unable to have this work done before the end of the fiscal year. In view of the fact that it is expected the road will be completed by the middle of this summer, I would suggest that the thing be held over. On the other hand if the Department would authorize that I send a man up to Lac La Ronge to see what actually is needed, it may be possible to have the work done within the next month.\n\nWill the Department please instruct.\n\nE. S. Jones,\nIndian Agent.\nMr. E. S. Jones,\nIndian Agent.\nLeask, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of Jan. 9th, regarding the cost of installation of toilets at the Indian School at Lac La Ronge Residential School. I do not know of any way that we can give you the approximate cost of this, as we do not know the present system of piping etc., at this place.\n\nDo you wish us to install same? And what are the present mode of transportation to the place, and cost of same?\n\nThe materials needed consist of 1 Flush Tank with syphon flush and approximately 8 feet of 3 inch pipe and fittings; 1 5inch x 3\" Reducing elbow; 5 toilets fastened to 8\" cast iron fixtures, with stands and seats; 1 8\" syphon jets, no partition walls included in this; and One reducing inverted trap with approximately 30 feet of 1\" or 2\" pipeing. This price you have in our last letter, namely, Four Hundred and Seventy-four $474.00, F.O.B. Prince Albert.\n\nYours truly,\nWilliam George & Co.\nOttawa, January 30, 1946.\n\nMr. E. S. Jones, Indian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 17th instant and also in the letter of January 11 from William George & Company, I consider no further action should be taken at the present time in connection with the Lac la Ronge School.\n\nI note that it is expected the road to the school will be completed during the summer. You should keep in touch with the Principal and have someone visit the school who is able to give you a reliable estimate of the cost of the materials required.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nLac la Ronge, Sask.\nDecember 31st, 1945.\n\nReceived from the Indian & Eskimo Residential School Commission, M.

If such are available we would make earnest application for one of suitable capacity to be sent here, thereby to relieve our girls of drudgery performed four times weekly at least.\n\nOur ranges have served their purpose and are really beyond repair.

Replacement should be made in time for the ranges in question to proceed by winter freight.\n\nIt will also be noted that Rev. Wickenden has made mention of an electrically driven bread mixer. For your information, I must advise that the lighting plant at this school is only large enough to supply the necessary lights, therefore, the bread mixer outlined is out of the question.\n\nE. S.

The fire broke into clear peals before crashing into the inferno below.\n\nOutpost residents stood huddled in helpless groups unable to take any steps against the fire swiftly eating its way through the building which had been a landmark since 1920 in this 167-year-old community.\n\nWithin an hour and a half the school had crashed to the ground and the only remnant of the huge three-storey frame structure was a pile of rubble smouldering in the frosty northern twilight.\n\nThe fire is reported to have started in the basement under the boys' playroom near one of the furnaces. When it was discovered alarms were quickly sounded throughout the building and all the children, 61 girls and 38 boys, were moved to safety in the Anglican church nearby.\n\nNone of the children's belongings were saved although a few personal effects of Miss E. Graham, senior room teacher, were removed before the fire had gained much headway.\n\nSupplies\nProvincial government and M. and C. Aviation company planes left Prince Albert Monday carrying provisions and clothing.\n\nAboard one of the aircraft was Dr. J. M. Morrow, medical superintendent of the federal department of Indian affairs for northern Saskatchewan. Lac La Ronge is 170 miles north of Prince Albert.\n\nRev. W. C. Wickenden, principal of the school, and Amy Hastings, the school engineer, attempted to use fire extinguishers and one of the pumps against the blaze. However, the flames speedily gained headway and were soon beyond all control.\n\nStaff members who lost all their possessions were Miss B. Williams, matron for the past 10 years; Miss MacKenzie, junior room teacher; Miss Hailstead, sewing room supervisor; Miss C. Foulds, kitchen supervisor; Miss L. McKenzie, assistant kitchen supervisor; W. Finlayson, night watchman, and A. Hastings, engineer.\n\nRelatives and friends speedily took the children into their homes where they will remain until parents come to claim them.\n\nAlready local officials in charge of the drive to collect money and clothing for the victims of Saturday's disastrous St. Patrick's orphanage fire in Prince Albert, have offered clothing for use by the La Ronge children.\nFebruary 18th, 1947.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.\nDirector-Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThank you for your letter of February 14th. I have been anxiously awaiting some definite word concerning the rebuilding of our School which was destroyed by fire at Lac la Ronge. I have not yet recovered from the shock or heartbreak of losing this school, for I know what a definite loss it is to our Indians in the North. I think I know these Indian bands of the North very well as I have spent considerable time amongst them. They are among the finest Indians to be found anywhere in Canada. For the most part they are living the life which they love and which was the life of their forefathers. They are hunters and trappers, travelling by dogs in winter and by canoes in summer. They never have been farmers and they never can be farmers because of the country in which they live; they live amid the lakes and rivers and trees and rocks.\n\nI do hope therefore, that it is the intention of the Government to rebuild this Northern school this year. I only wish I could talk this matter over with you and the other officials concerned because I think I have information that would be of use to you. I am very much afraid that if something is not done immediately by the Federal Government that we shall lose precious ground in the educating of these Indian children and in preparing them for the days that lie ahead.\n\nI was at Montreal Lake yesterday. I only wish you could have been with me. Our teacher there, Mr. Waite, with his efficient wife, is doing a magnificent job, and that under conditions, that in my estimation, are deplorable; but I am sure that both Inspector Ostrander and Indian Agent Jones have told you of the condition of his house and also of the school.\n\nAgain assuring you of my keen desire to see some immediate action for the replacement of this school; and with kindest personal regards,\n\nI am,\n\nSincerely yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6316, file 656-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 25, 1947.\n\nDear Bishop Martin:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of February 18. I regret to inform you that there is little possibility of replacing the Lac la Ronge School within the next two years.\n\nAs you are aware, we have yet to rebuild the other residential schools that have burned down during the war. Unfortunately, building and labour conditions are such that it is difficult to know when we can start such a building programme.\n\nIt is our intention to send Major Clark, our Educational Surveys Officer, into Northern Saskatchewan this summer in order to ascertain the educational facilities which should be provided for these Indians.\n\nYour efforts on behalf of these Indians are sincerely appreciated and it is regretted that we cannot rebuild this school at once.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRight Reverend Henry D.

No. 453 Charles, Ida Elizabeth No. 446\nBird Kitchener Allan of No. 274 Charles, Myles Tkt. No. 580.\n\nIt is my intention to proceed to Lac La Ronge in the very near future, however, before going I would like the Department to instruct re: the disposition of equipment the property of this branch such as the lighting plant and other equipment which I believe was salvaged from the fire.\n\nThe records in this office do not indicate the amount of Department property which was on hand, if such a record is available from your files, will you please let me have it.\n\nRegarding the batteries and engine of the lighting system, this I believe can be very well used at these headquarters.\n\nE. S. Jones,\nIndian Agent.\n\nESJ/ae\nClothing Sent To La Ronge Fire Victims\n\nFour boxes of supplies were shipped by the Red Cross today to relieve the situation at La Ronge where children and staff of an Indian residential school lost all their possessions when the school burned to the ground last Friday.\n\nThe boxes were shipped by transport truck and are expected to arrive at La Ronge sometime over the weekend. Included in the shipment are blankets, quilted socks, mitts, sweaters, jackets, underclothing, pajamas and miscellaneous items.\n\nMrs. C. S. Nance, secretary of the Prince Albert branch, Canadian Red Cross, said the supplies sent to La Ronge were shipped in from Regina for orphanage survivors. However, as their most urgent needs have been met and these supplies were not immediately needed, it was agreed to send them to La Ronge.\n\nPrince Albert\n7 February 1947\nAir Mail\n\nOttawa, February 26th, 1947.\n\nMr. E.S. Jones, Indian Agent,\nLEASK, Saskatchewan:\n\nWe have your letter of the 21st inst., giving the names of the children who have been transferred from the Lac la Ronge to Gordon's Residential School. It is noted that you intend to visit Lac la Ronge in the near future.\n\nIf the lighting plant or any other equipment at the school which is owned by the Government can be used at your Agency, the Department is prepared to approve such action.\n\nHowever, if there is any Government-owned property that is not required and will have to be sold, you should make a list of such articles, give us a report on their condition and forward the list to this office so that we can obtain the necessary authority from the Salvage Officer. If there are any articles that anyone in the locality wishes to purchase, they should be included on the list just mentioned.\n\nAlso, you should let us know the name and address of any person who wishes to make such purchases and the amount that they are prepared to pay. This information will also be supplied to the Salvage Officer. We have not received a recent list of the Government property on hand at Lac la Ronge.\n\nBernard F.

Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI arrived back in my office this morning after being away for the last six days visiting Red Earth and Shoal Lake Reserves in this Province. As you can imagine, the going was pretty strenuous owing to our very severe winter this year.\n\nI was sadly disappointed and almost discouraged when I read your letter in which you regret to inform me that there is little possibility of replacing the Lac la Ronge School within the next two years.\n\nI do hope this is not a final decision. I wish it were possible for me to talk with you face to face, and also the minister, because I think I could put facts before you that would assist you in coming to a decision that would call for an immediate rebuilding of this school. I am greatly concerned about this whole matter and it is most discouraging when, upon occasion after occasion, one is faced with nothing but frustration and inability to carry forward work that is so necessary; owing to lack of equipment.\n\nEvery person I have met here in the North since the destruction of the Lac la Ronge School takes it for granted that the Government will immediately rebuild. I shall hesitate to inform them that there is no likelihood of any such rebuilding within the next two years, because of their surprise and disappointment.\n\nAgain expressing my regret, and also the fact that I cannot talk the matter over with you personally,\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nBP/t\n### SUPPLIES RECEIVED FROM MISSION\n\n**February 19, 1947**\n\n| Item Description | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Cost |\n|------------------|----------|------------|------------|\n| tins (1's) Fry's Cocoa | 12 | .29\u00a2 | 3.54 |\n| 25's Val King raisins | 4 | 4.40 | 17.60 |\n| lbs.

M. Morrow on Feb. 3rd, the day following the fire at All Saints Indian Residential School, Lac La Ronge, now submit the following statement.\n\nThe fire broke out at 1.00 p.m. Sunday, February 2nd when I was at the foot of the steps leading from the boys' playroom to the basement. A boy, who was in the vicinity for the furnace nearby, gave the alarm and I noticed that a hot air pipe emerging from the furnace was glowing red, and that the wooden boxing of cold air rent overhead was aflame. This air flue ran across the floor joists and led to the cold air register box in the centre of the boys' playroom. I may say incidentally that Mr. Hastings, our engineer, said subsequently that he had not yet fired up at that particular furnace, but had found it shortly before reduced to a bed of glowing embers and had gone in search of his ash raker to the far end of the basement. He was, therefore, suspicious that some boy or boys through carelessness or foolishness had had something to do with the origin of the fire in the hot air pipe.\n\nBoys got large pans which were handy in the basement and tried to dampen the flames with water. Mr. Hastings was sitting by the pump engine at the time, waiting, presumably until his usual time for starting the pump. A water hose was kept hanging near that particular furnace, and I told Mr. Hastings to get it into action. Meantime I ran upstairs for the big fire extinguisher and by the time I got down he had opened the adjacent workshop and had the hose ready. One of the boys assisted Mr. Hastings operated the fire extinguisher and I assisted Mr. Hastings with the hose. Since there was hardly any force behind the water I told Mr. Hastings to get the pump working while I managed the hose. I may say that the previous night had been our coldest, 35 degrees below zero, and that our water pipes in the basement had been frozen. It was 10.00 A.M. before there was running water in the school, and at the time of the fire water pressure was abnormally low. The day was windy and bitterly cold, and, of course there was a strong draught along the cold air flue. This was lined with paper and the fire spread rapidly along it. We dampened the flames from below, creating stifling smoke in the process, but were unable to affect the fire within the ventilator and underneath the floor of the boys' playroom. Our engineer lost no time in getting the pump to work and there was an immediate increase in the volume and pressure of the water, but our efforts were unavailing against the flames once they had taken hold upon the old, dry timber of the school. In a few minutes after the alarm was first given, the basement was so thick with smoke that it was impossible to work there and I had to abandon all hope of checking the fire.\n\nThe fire alarms had been sounded immediately the fire was detected, and I found later that the building had been rapidly vacated. Mr. Finlayson, the nightwatchman, was the only person in bed and asleep at the time, but I noticed him outside when I myself left the basement by the stairs remote from the fire.\nThe matron had got a boy to go up the top floor after little Walter McKenzie, who was by himself in the comfort of the boys' supervisor's room undergoing a rest treatment for a burnt leg. All the children were warmly dressed in their Sunday overcoats, and some of them had their weekday ones also. After ordering the children into the Church in order that they might be counted I went back to the school to assure myself that everyone was out. By the time I was free to go back to the office to see if anything could be salvaged, the smoke was so dense and the flames threatening that it was not possible to rescue correspondence files and records except a few at hand by the veranda window. Helpers were not long in running to help, but with the exception of the lighting plant and portable things in the laundry very little was saved. Most of the furniture from the staff sitting-room was removed, and that from Miss Graham's room next door. That was all. Staff losses alone amounted to not less than two thousand dollars.\n\nFortunately none of the outbuildings was harmed, although the farm instructor's house was threatened. After reimbursing local traders who had supplied our children while they were being cared for by Lac La Ronge people I sold the bulk of our food stores. I should have said that within three hours of the outbreak of fire all our pupils were accommodated by local people, and that I had made arrangements with the storekeepers to provide them with staples. As you know Dr. Morrow and Bishop Martin flew in the next day to give assistance in the matter of food and clothing, and in making arrangements for the pupils to be returned to their homes.\n\nIt will not be possible for me to give you a complete list of the children who returned to their homes until my records arrive from Lac La Ronge, which ought to be soon. On the day of the fire there were 98 children enrolled. All were in residence with the exception of three boys who had been truant for some days: Thomas Roberts of Montreal Lake, who had gone to his mother, Mrs. Nancy LaFavor, on the 5th of January and had been missing ever since; Alex. Mirasty and Charles Roberts, both of Sucker River, who had gone home together on January 20, and had not been returned to school by their parents during the spell of severe weather.\n\nBy Tuesday, Feb. 4, pupils from Sucker River, Stanley and Pelican Narrows had been flown home, and to days later Dr. Morrow flew south with the Montreal Lake children. All these children had blankets or quilts and were given rations for several days. Provisions was also made for them to be supplied at their local stores until they were in the care of their own people. I may say that large supplies of clothing for emergency needs had come in from the Red Cross Prince Albert and from various church organizations by the time I left Lac La Ronge en route for Gordon's School, Punnichy on the 20th of February and more is on the way. The labour of distribution I left to our missionary, the Rev. S. Cuthand, who willingly offered his services. Bishop Martin is also giving his assistance in this matter.\n\nAs you know I was called away from the business of property disposal and our Administration appointed Mr. Spooner as agent. Before I left I made contracts to rent the Principal's residence and the fisherman's cottage on a monthly basis. I have already mentioned my disposal of food stores. Mr. Spooner was directed not to dispose of the paint sent in by the Department or any other stores which might be considered as the Department's property. I understand that the Superintendent of our Administration is looking into the question of ownership. There were considerable stocks of clothing, footwear, sealers, soap and school supplies, which I ordered to be transferred to Gordon's School.\nIn our conversation by telephone I gave you the names of pupils transferred to this school in care of Dr. Morrow.\n\nMyles Charles of Stanley, son of Catherine Charles, deceased.\nMinnie Mirasty\nDemar Mirasty\nLydia Mirasty all of Lac La Ronge, children of Mrs. Percy (Betsy) Charles and Paul Mirasty deceased.\nWillink Charles\nMoses Charles\nIda Charles, all of Lac La Ronge, children of Mrs. Wm. (Norah) Irving and H. Stanley Charles deceased.\nKitchener Allan Bird, of Lac La Ronge, son of Peter Bird and Olive Bird, deceased.\n\nDavid Charles, half brother of Myles Charles, aged 6 years was taken to Stanley, but since he is an orphan perhaps he should be brought to the school, like Myles, to be taken care of properly.\n\nPeter Custer of Pelican Narrows was left at Lac La Ronge in care of Joseph Wilfred Ross. The latter inadvisedly took the boy on a trip to Little Hills so that he missed the plane which returned the Pelican Narrows children.\n\nI trust the foregoing report will prove adequate, but shall be pleased to supply additional information if needed, subject to the limitations of records now at my disposal.\n\nThe tragic ending of our work at Lac La Ronge was mitigated by the fact that no lives were lost and that the building, admittedly, was overdue for replacement. Despite the present unfavourable trade conditions I hope, with our church in general and our Indian School administration in particular, that the day will not be long delayed for the resumption of our work with the Indian children of Northern Saskatchewan under more favourable conditions.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) D.

G. Wickenden.\nLeask, Saskatchewan,\nMarch 19, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a copy of the report submitted to this office by Rev. Wickenden, now principal of the Gordon Indian Residential School, in connection with the fire that destroyed the Indian Residential School at Lac La Ronge.\n\nOn arriving at Lac La Ronge, Saturday, March 15th, last, I learned that the Officer in Charge of the R.C.M.P. Police at that point had carried out an investigation re: the cause of the fire. To date the Police report covering same has not been received at this office, but in view of the discoveries made by myself, I am satisfied the Police will have found that the responsibility of the fire rests on four boys who were pupils at the school. This matter will be the subject of another report when the Police report has been received.\n\nThe following equipment which I believe is the property of the Department was saved:\n- The lighting plant complete including 10H.P. Diesel engine, generator, switch board and 32 batteries.\n- A saw mill, complete with engine and planer.\n- A large quantity of paint.\n- 23 storm windows, 6 complete windows, less frames.\n\nThe lighting plant with the exception of the batteries has been placed in the warehouse. The batteries are in heated storage at the Saskatchewan Fish Filleting Plant at Lac La Ronge, arrangements have been made to have the batteries placed on their line for the occasional charge.\n\nThere were large quantities of food supplies and clothing in the warehouse which is intact, these supplies no doubt, will be the property of the Church Authorities.\nThe following buildings remain undamaged:\n\nPrincipal's Residence; A two story frame house with basement 5 rooms and bathroom. The building is wired and sewage system is installed. This building is at present leased to Mr. McCabe an employee of the Provincial Government, by the Church Authorities.\n\nThe Warehouse; A two story building 18'x40', Lumber, 14' stud cement foundation, building is in good repair and half has been rented to the Saskatchewan Fish Filleting Plant by the Church Authorities.\n\nThe Ice House; 14'x16', 12' stud, galvanized roof, Lumber, building is built on rocks and is a good building.\n\nThe Oil House; 12'x14', Lumber, building is in good repair and is not built on a foundation.\n\nBarn; 24'x28', Lumber, this building is in good repair and is built on a rock footing.\n\nCottage; 12'x14', Lumber, good repair, built on stone foundation.\n\nFarming Instructor's Residence; 18'x20', Lumber, this building definitely does belong to Church Authorities.\n\nThe above is a complete list of buildings remaining on the site. I would point out, irrespective of ownership, all buildings would be or can be made suitable for the establishment of a Nursing Station at this point. The Department warehouse at this point is too small for our requirements and it will definitely be necessary that we have one of the buildings for an office so that I may have a roof over my head when at Lac La Ronge.\n\nE.

However, in the meantime, might this matter be brought to the attention of the property authority. It will be noted that there does not now appear to be anyone here who has any responsibility in regard to the mission property. Might also, Kitchener BIRD be interviewed at Punnichy; it is felt that there are other boys besides those already mentioned, that are implicated in this matter.\n\nFurther report will be submitted to meet DD.\n\n(A.L. Kirkby) I/0 Detachment.\nIn this connection also interviewed Cora (Mrs. R Sanderson who had boarded one of the children for a time after the fire. Mrs. Sanderson advised that she had boarded one John Roberts for about a week after the fire and that during the time this boy was with her he appeared very nervous and would not leave the place. After he had been sent to his home at Stanley this woman was told by her son that Roberts had stated that he had helped to set the fire and asked the boy not to say anything till after he had gone home. Apparently the boy told his mother of this but she did not see fit to report the matter. Following is statement taken from David Sanderson, son of Cora Sanderson noted above.\n\n\"I am David Sanderson, I state as follows: I attend the La Ronge Day School, don't go to the Mission. On the Sunday of the fire at the Mission my mother brought John Roberts home to stay with us till his folks came from Stanley for him. While he was at our place he told me that he had helped to set the fire along with Kitchener Bird and some other boys. He said that they poured some kerosene on the basement floor then set a match to it, after which they went down in the Settlement till the building was ablaze. He would not say what other boys were in on it too other than Kitchener Bird. He made me promise that I would not say anything till after he had gone home. As soon as he left I told my mother about it and I think she told the Minister.\" ends.\n\nEnquiries reveal that John ROBERTS is now with his family who are trapping on Deception Lake, some distance north of Jonas HALKETT, noted in this report is at present with his family at Foster River and Burdock McKenzie is at Stanley. It is thought these boys will be interviewed in this connection as soon as possible.\n\nKitchener BIRD, was transferred to Gordon's School at or near Melfort, Sask. It is also understood that Mr. WICKENDEN, the former Principal of this school is now Principal at the Gordon...\nI am Wilson Charles, I state as follows:- I was attending the Anglican Mission School at Lac La Ronge at the time of the fire; I have been attending the school for several years now. When the fire started on Sunday, Feb. 2, I was in the Principal's office being punished for not attending church. I was there for some time before the alarm was given.\n\nOn the previous Monday, January 27th, a fire was started in the basement by Kitchener Bird. This boy told me he took hot ashes out of the furnace and placed them under a pile of wood in the basement. This fire was discovered by the principal, I think, and was put out. Kitchener Bird told me that night that he had started that fire. Nothing was ever said around the school about that fire.\n\nOn Sunday night, Feb. 2nd, the night after the fire that destroyed the school, I was walking on the road with Kitchener Bird and we were talking about the big fire and he told me that he had set it. I didn't ask him much about it as I was too scared. I think he got some gasoline and started it behind one of the furnaces. I was alone with Kitchener at this time but I think that Jack Mirasty and Noah Bird knew that he set it. The time before when he was telling me that he started the fire under the wood pile I was with Burdock McKenzie. I do not know if there was any one else with Kitchener when he set the school on fire. This is all I know about this.\"\n\nENDS.\n\nNoah Bird also interviewed but denied having any knowledge of this matter other than he had heard boys say the fire had been started by some of the boys. This boy was attending the Mission.\n\nJack Mirasty interviewed and closely questioned it this connection and following is his statement.\n\n\"I am Jack Mirasty of Lac La Ronge, I also attended the Anglican Mission here.\n\nI was in the boys play room at the time of the fire. I saw Kitchener Bird, Jonas Halkett and some other boys run up from the basement on that Sunday (Feb. 2) and they said that the place was on fire, I do not know who the other boys were; I got scared when I saw the smoke coming up and beat it outside. I hear some of the boys talking that Kitchener set the fire. I think that Jonas was with him at the time.\" ENDS.\n\nVERY POOR COPY\nIn the above connection I beg to report that on the 2-2-47, the Anglican Mission at this point was destroyed by fire. Since that time rumours have been circulated in the settlement to the effect that the fire had been set by some of the children. As the Principal, Mr. Nickenden, left this point a few days after the fire, writer interviewed Mr. D.E. Spooner, farm instructor at the Mission and advised him of the above. Spooner advised that he had also heard rumours to the effect that the fire had been started by the children, but that as he did not know what his position was now in regards to the school, whether he was in charge of the property etc., and also that he had been given to understand that the suspicions as to the origin of the fire had been reported to the Principal prior to his departure and in view of this he had not felt it his responsibility to make any complaint to the detachment. Mr. Spooner was unable to offer any information of value regarding the origin of the fire as he had been at home at the time and did not get back to the school till the blaze was well started and it was too late to attempt to put same out.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Principal and teachers have left this point and apparently there being no one here who cares to take any responsibility with regards to the Mission property it has been deemed to be expedient to invest light the cause of this blaze. Accordingly, Andrew Hastings, engineer, formerly employed by the above Mission was interviewed and he advised the writer to the effect that at the time of the fire he had been working in the basement and that a few minutes prior to the blaze he had seen several children run up the stairs from the basement, he was unable to give any idea as to who the children were but stated that as the blaze started shortly after, or was discovered shortly afterwards he was certain in his own mind that they had started same and was of the opinion that the fire could not have started near the furnace or from a faulty furnace as was stated. Hastings advised he had reported his suspicions to the Principal and had thus felt it not his responsibility to report the matter further.\n\nAs a result of enquiries made by writer in the settlement in this regard, writer interviewed Wilson Charles, who had been attending the Mission at the time of the fire. Following is a statement taken from this boy.\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\nHEADQUARTERS\n\nOUR FILE NO.: 47 B-692-3-G 2\n\nTO: The Director, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, OTTAWA\n\nMarch 25, 1947\n\nReport dated 7/3/47 from Lac La Ronge, Sask., forwarded for your information, re Kitchener BIRD & John ROBERTS, Lac La Ronge, Sask.\n\nEnc.\n\nDirector Criminal Investigation.\n\nper\n\nIndian Affairs.

Notwithstanding this fact it would be a mistake, I believe, to allow him to remain at the Gordon's School because he will no doubt be telling other boys of his escapade and be quite a hero amongst them. I would therefore recommend that he be returned to his home.\n\nI understand that Mr. Wickenden has to return to Lac la Ronge shortly to complete some unfinished business in connection with the school and I think it would be advisable for the boy to be returned to Lac la Ronge at the same time and that he be discharged from the school.\n\nJ.F.B.

The Rev. D.G. PICKERDEN, former Principal of All Saints Indian Residential School, Lee Le Ronge, Sask., was interviewed and the following statement obtained:\n\n\"I, Rev. D.G. PICKERDEN, state as follows:\nJust before 1:00 P.M. on February 2nd, 1947 I went to the boy's playroom, seeking a certain boy, one of four who had been troublesome to staff members during the morning. Not finding him there I went downstairs to the basement where I noticed two or three boys. This part of the basement was partitioned off and served as a washroom. I passed through the doorway on the north side and turned into the main part of the basement. Not seeing the boy I sought, I returned and was about to climb the stairs when a boy in the vicinity of the furnace nearby (in the north-west corner of the basement) yelled out to me: 'There's a fire!' I looked in his direction and noticed that a section of hot air pipe emerging from the furnace was red hot, and that a patch of the wooden boxing of the cold air vent fairly close overhead was aflame. This air flue ran between the floor joists and led to the cold air register box in the boy's senior classroom. The said hot air pipe led to the register box in the boys' playroom. Three or four big boys gathered and we ran to the centre of the basement where there were some large cans to the water taps. Mr. Andrew HASTINGS, the school engineer, was sitting there by the pump engine, and I told him to get water hose into action (this hose was kept hanging close to the furnace at the west end) while I ran off to get the large fire extinguisher upstairs. I had ordered the fire-alarms to be sounded, and when I came down with the fire extinguisher I gave it to Isaac BALLINTINE, one of big boys, to operate for a time while I helped Mr. HASTINGS with the hose. Subsequently, when I was discussing the origin of the fire with our engineer, Mr. HASTINGS declared positively that he had not yet fired up at that particular furnace. He had found it not long before the fire alarm was given reduced to a bed of glowing embers, and had gone to the far end of the basement in search of his ash rake. At the time of the outbreak of fire he had tended the other furnaces only. He was, therefore, suspicious.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6316, file 656-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSTATEMENT OF REV. L. G. WICKENDEN CONTINUED\n\nHE THEREFORE SUSPECTS that some boy or boys, through carelessness or foolishness, had had something to do with the origin of the fire, especially since he remembered that a certain boy had snarled past him when he went down into the basement.\n\nSigned L. G. WICKENDEN,\nPrincipal, All Saints Indian Res. School\nLee La Ronge, Sask.,\n\n3. Kitchener A. BIRD, mentioned in Lee La Ronge Detachment report was also interviewed and the following statement obtained:\n\n\"I, Kitchener Alan BIRD, Treaty Indian aged 12 years, state as follows, I am the son of Peter BIRD of the James ROBERTS band of Lee La Ronge, Saskatchewen.\n\nI have been attending the Lee La Ronge Indian school since 1944. I'm in the 2nd grade. I slept in the main dormitory with all the other boys. During the winter months there has been quite a lot of talk about burning the school down by the boys in the dormitory, Isaac BALLINTYNE, Wilson CHARLES, and Jack MIRASTY and I have talked about burning the school down.\n\nOn Monday January 27th, 1947, I was in class at the school and I asked my teacher for permission to go to the toilet. And I went down to the basement and while there I took a coal shovel and took some hot ashes from under the firebox of the furnace and put them on the cordwood which was stacked in the basement. The wood caught fire after while and it was discovered by the Principal and put out.\n\nOn Sunday February 2nd, 1947 at about 1:00 p.m., I was in the boys playroom with Jack MIRASTY, Norh BIRD, and Isaac BALLINTYNE and we started to talk about setting fire to the school. We all went down the basement steps and when we arrived at the basement Jack MIRASTY asked me if I had a match and I did not have any. Jack MIRASTY gave me two or three matches and I went to the back of the furnace on the west side of the building where there was some cardboard cartons which had been torn up. I struck the matches on the shelf of the cold air flue and placed them on the torn pieces of cardboard. They immediately caught fire and flared up. I then got scared and ran up the stairs and outside, the other boys had already gone out.\n\nAfter this I stood around and watched the school burn down. I have only told one boy about setting this fire and that was Sampson SANDERSON of Lee La Ronge, Sask.\"\n\nWitness,\n\nSigned Kitchener A. BIRD.\n\nRev. L. G. Wickenden.\n\n(P. T. O.)\n4. The above statement was obtained from this juvenile after he had made several attempts to put forth various stories regarding the origin of the fire, he is quite ready with an explanation for any question put to him and will lie rather than attempt to tell the truth. KITCHENER will be 13 years of age on the 31st of March 1947, he is small of stature and has not the slightest conception as to the value of the damage he has caused by setting fire to the school.\n\n5. The Rev. D. G. WICKENDEN, former principal of the School was present during the interrogation of this boy and the location of where KITCHENER states he started the fire was checked with the knowledge of the building by Mr. WICKENDEN, the point stated by KITCHENER where he set the cardboard on fire was directly underneath the cold air vent, it was ascertained that this particular cold air vent was of wooden construction to within three or four feet of the furnace and was lined with paper, it being alleged that when same was constructed there was a shortage of tin piping and this was a makeshift affair.\n\n6. The hot air pipe observed by Mr. WICKENDEN as being red hot runs directly underneath this cold air vent which are all located at the back of the furnace at the west end of the school. For record purposes it is pointed out that this school was heated by three hot air furnaces fired with cord lengths of wood.\n\n7. No explanation was obtained from KITCHENER as to why he committed this offence, and it was also ascertained that KITCHENER together with several other boys were to be the subject of prosecution in the near future for petty thefts from the local stores at Lee La Ronge. Mr. WICKENDEN advises that he is of the opinion that the boys involved in this action may have planned the destruction of the school in order that they could return to their various homes and thus avoid any further action for the thefts.\n\n8. Mr. WICKENDEN advises that he was kept busy the week following the fire disposing of stores etc., and was then transferred to the Gordon Indian School at Punnichy, Sask., in view of which he was not in a position to take this matter up with the local Detachment and, further, he made a full report to his immediate superiors.\n\n9.

Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Sask.\n\nThe R.C.M.P. have forwarded to us a copy of\na letter dated April 8th which they received from\nyou with regard to Kitchener Bird and John Roberts.\n\nOur officials recently considered the information\nplaced before us by the R.C.M.P., and we were inclined\nto feel that it would be advisable to prosecute these\nboys.\n\nI think you will agree that their action might\nhave resulted in more serious results than actually\nhappened, as there might have been considerable loss of\nlife. If they are let go free without suffering any\npunishment, the consequences might encourage other boys\nto follow their example at other residential schools.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would review this\nimportant matter in your own mind and let me hear from\nyou as soon as possible. Possibly you could interview\nthe Provincial Attorney General and obtain his views\nin the matter.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/UGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 23rd instant, File No. 132-2-5 (WT 1), in connection with the burning of the Lac la Ronge School, and proposed prosecution of Kitchener Bird and John Roberts, I have today discussed the matter with the Deputy Attorney General and his attitude in the matter seems to be that he should not recommend what action should be taken with a view to punishment of the boys concerned but he states that, if our Department decides to prosecute, his Department will then see that the necessary action is taken.\n\nI certainly would be in favour of punishing these boys if suitable punishment could be found but the only punishment that can be meted out to them is a term in the Industrial School here in Regina where their associates will be incorrigible white boys, many of whom know far more about law-breaking than these backward Indian boys from the north woods will ever know. Kitchener Bird has now been returned to his home and John Roberts has been at his home for some time.\n\nTo proceed with prosecutions it will probably be necessary for a worker from the Social Aid Branch and a Magistrate to be flown into the North and the boys, if convicted, flown out again. These boys will probably view a flying trip out to Prince Albert and a train trip to Regina as fun. After a term in the Industrial School it would still not be safe to put them in an Indian residential school and the only thing which then could be done with them would be to return them to their homes as little heroes who had received considerable notoriety as a result of their \"brave\" act in burning the school.\n\nI may say that I gave this matter considerable thought before making the recommendation which I made to Superintendent Mortimer. I decided then that no good would come through any action of this kind being taken, and, while I do not wish to appear stubborn in the matter, I still am unable to see the matter in any other light. However, if the Department decides that it would be better to prosecute I am quite prepared to abide by the Department's decision.\n\nJ.P.B.

This boy, not yet thirteen years of age, had confessed to striking the match and starting the fire which destroyed our residential school at Lac la Ronge on Feb. 2. However, as I explained in a lengthy report to Mr. Ostrander on March 26, the chief instigator and the boy who supplied the matches was Jack Mirasty, aged fifteen and the oldest boy in school in respect of residence. I also pointed out that most of the boys who were named as having spoken at different times of burning the school down had been implicated in the serious thefts from Olsen's store and cafe during November last, concerning which you wrote me early in January. In getting rid of the school perhaps they thought that they would escape possible trouble in connection with the thefts.\n\nWhen I was at Lac la Ronge last week Cpl. Kirkby, R.C.M.P., told me that he had received instructions from headquarters to close his file concerning the fire. Presumably that means that no action is to be taken against these juvenile offenders, and hence, this letter of enquiry. They know that they have committed punishable crimes and have confessed their guilt. Failure to bring them to trial in a court of law will only be interpreted as a sign of weak indulgence and indifference. There will be for these young delinquents and their associates no such thing as the \"majesty of the law\", but rather a growing disregard for all law and order and a corresponding contempt for officers of the law. I cannot conceive that offences of a similar nature would be overlooked in civilized society, and it is our task to Christianize our Indian wards and to instill into them a healthy respect for the white man's justice.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nActing Principal\nLac La Ronge, Sask. May 1st 1947\n\nJ.W. Corman\nAttorney General\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Corman,\n\nOn Feb. 2nd of this year the Indian residential school here was completely destroyed by fire.\n\nInvestigations regarding this fire reveal that this was arson committed by 5 boys attending the school.\n\nI understand that upon advice from the Indian Dept. at Ottawa, no charge whatever will be laid against those boys, they are not going to be prosecuted.\n\nIs it within your jurisdiction to lay a charge?\n\nIf not, would you confirm the current report, which is apparently true, that no proceedings will be instituted against those little firebugs? I would then take up this matter with Ottawa.\n\nI own a dwelling house here, together with a warehouse, both buildings carry fire insurance with our own provincial insurance office, but somehow, with these firebugs still at large, I feel that, as a resident of Saskatchewan, I am not getting the protection to which I am entitled.\n\nYours very truly\n\n(Sgd.)

They are both little children from the bush country who were dissatisfied at the school and managed to burn it because they did not realize the seriousness of their action.\n\nPerhaps I have taken the wrong view of this matter, and I must admit my original view has not changed, but no good will be done anyone to bring these two Indian boys out of the bush and place them in the Industrial Home here in Regina for a period of months or years. Perhaps such action would give Mr. Vander-Kracht the feeling of safety for a time but I presume he would not suggest that they should be confined indefinitely in order that his buildings may be safe indefinitely. I believe in punishment where good will be done, or might be done, but I do not believe in punishment in a case of this kind where I firmly believe more harm will be done the two boys. They will learn more about crime and misdemeanor in an industrial school than they have learned, or will learn, in their home environment.\"\n\nIndian Affairs.

Jones, Indian Agent, Leask, Saskatchewan.\n\nFurther to our letter of July 4th, we are again requesting that the invoice covering the two stoves purchased for the Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School be forwarded immediately. It is quite likely that the delay is caused by your having to obtain duplicate invoices from General Steel Wares but if this is the case you should advise us what action you have taken.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 19, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 27th, re account No. 2585 dated April 23rd in the amount of $245.72, we have endeavoured to obtain the certified invoices from the Principal of the Lac La Ronge School. However, we have been advised that the invoices have apparently been lost in transit.\n\nIn order that we might give this account immediate attention, we would appreciate receiving duplicate sets of the above invoice dated April 23rd in the amount of $245.72.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nGeneral Steel Wares, Ltd.,\nP.O.

Through our headquarters Ottawa information has been received from\nthe Director of Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, that prosecution is desirable.\nThe matter was referred to the Deputy Attorney-General Regina and he replied\nunder date of July 7 as follows:\n\n\"Referring to your letter of the 28th ultimo and to the recent\ntelephonic conversation which Superintendent Mortimer had with\nme I hereby confirm the said conversation wherein it was decided\nthat the prosecution herein should proceed in view of the directions\nreceived by the Commissioner from the Director of Indian Affairs\nBranch, Ottawa, under date the 10thday of June last.\n\nThis fire was on the 2nd day of February and as a result of no action\nbeing taken we are still carrying on correspondence as to whether\nor not a prosecution should be instituted and if no action is taken\nthe question arises as to when this correspondence is going to end, and\nas the case may finally end with a prosecution, such as in the case\nunder section 265(6), of the Criminal Code in the Judicial District\nof Moosomin in which we had to institute a prosecution in order to\nend an endless chain of correspondence extending over about a year\ntrying to stave off a prosecution, it would seem advisable to start the\nprosecution now in order to dispose of the case.\"\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would have an Information and Complaint\nlaid against each of the accused and properly waived and forwarded to this\noffice so that prosecution may proceed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd.

Hoey, Esq., Director, Indian Affairs Branch, OTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 10th ultimo, File No. 132-2-5 (WT), regarding the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School Fire, and proposed prosecution of Kitchener Bird and John Roberts, I am now in receipt of a letter from Superintendent W. Mortimer, in charge C.I.B., R.C.M. Police, Regina, asking me to have Information and Complaint laid against the two boys concerned. I shall do so only upon receiving your instructions to that effect as I certainly do not approve of proceeding with the prosecution of these two boys simply because some people wish revenge against them, when we know full well that any attempt at correction in an institution will do them more harm than good. The matter of prosecution then looks like revenge upon children, as they are no more than children.\n\nI saw Kitchener Bird a few days ago at Lac la Ronge and was again impressed with the fact that he is but a simple little child who, I am sure, did not know the seriousness of his act. I did not see the other boy at this time but his case is very similar.\n\nCopy of Superintendent Mortimer's letter is enclosed herewith.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nOttawa, July 24th, 1947.\n\nMr. J.P.B.

I have to advise that Voucher No. 585 dated June 25 was completed and forwarded from this office to the Department on June 25 last.\n\nE. S. Jones,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReference is made to our letter 727-2-50 dated July 24th in connection with the batteries at Lac La Ronge which were salvaged from the fire. We also have a diesel engine at that point which will not be needed since it is understood a complete new unit is to be installed if and when a nursing station is established. The engine in question is one of the old type diesel motors, is badly in need of repairs.\n\nMay I suggest that I be authorized to have the engine shipped out for repairs and held at these headquarters until such time as it may be required at some other point.\n\nE. J. Jones,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 31st, 1947.\n\nMr. E.S. Jones, Indian Agent,\nLeask, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant, I understand that you have already been written regarding the batteries salvaged from the fire at the Lac la Ronge School.\n\nWith reference to the engine which you state requires repairs, we would appreciate having an estimate of the cost of the repairs needed.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, August 2nd, 1947.\n\nMr. E.S. Jones, Indian Agent,\nLeask, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to two stoves which were delivered for the Lac la Ronge School and are now stored under your direction, please let Mr. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies, have full particulars regarding their size, etc.\n\nHe probably receives requests from time to time from an Indian residential school or an Indian day school where one or both these stoves could be used. If so, he can arrange for their transfer.\n\nYou should advise us when you have found a suitable location for them.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nc/c to Mr. J.P.B. Ostrander.\n\nPP/MDG\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nReference is made to your letter 132-2-5 (WT1) of July 31, 1947 re: repairs to Engine. It is presumed the engine referred to is the one at the Agency headquarters. It is more or less impossible for me to give you an estimate of the repairs needed. Before this can be ascertained it will be necessary to have the engine torn down.\n\nI am aware that the following repairs will have to be made; new fuel pump, crank shaft and gears. This will cost in the neighbourhood of $150.00. No doubt when the engine is torn down other parts needing replacement will be found. I estimate that the repairs and labour will be in the neighbourhood of $200.00.\n\nRegarding the engine at Lac La Ronge, this too is a Diesel, it requires a new crank shaft and bearings, possibly other repairs too.\n\nI regret I can not give any further information.\n\nE. S. Jones,\nIndian Agent.\n\nESJ/ae\nOttawa, August 14th, 1947.\n\nMr. E.S. Jones, Indian Agent,\nLeask, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have your letter of the 7th instant with reference to repairs to a diesel engine.\n\nOur letter did not refer to the engine at the Agency headquarters. Your letter of July 24th distinctly referred to the engine located at the site of the former Lac la Ronge School.\n\nFrom the information contained in your last communication it appears that repairs to the engine just mentioned would involve an expenditure of $350. If we incurred this expenditure, could you use the engine at any point in your Agency? If so, where? If not, you might ascertain from Inspector Ostrander if it could be used at some other school in Saskatchewan.\n\nBernard F.

Gustave Brault, Acting Chief Architect, Department of Public Works, Ottawa.\n\nOn the 15th instant Mr. J. Ramage, of the office of the District Resident Architect, Saskatoon; Mr. R.S. Jones, Indian Agent, Carlton agency; and the writer went through the buildings which are available, or soon to be available, and which would prove suitable for a residential school. It will be noted that buildings No. 2, 3, 9, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35, 36, and 38 are all vacant and have been handed over to the Department of Public Works by the Department of Labour (Canadian Vocational Training). These buildings are somewhat scattered about the grounds of the training centre. No. 33 is a mess hall now available but it is in very bad shape and much of the equipment has been removed or destroyed, and it is very desirable to obtain building No. 34, which is a similar mess hall but in good condition and immediately adjacent to No. 33. No. 34 is held by the Provincial Department of Reconstruction but is not being used. Every effort should be made to obtain the use of No. 34 at once. The buildings which should immediately be put in use for the school are No. 2, to be made into two residential suites; No. 3 to be made into two residential suites; No. 34, combined kitchen and dining rooms; No. 23 and No. 29 \"Huts,\" in good condition, suitable for dormitories; and No. 27, the drill hall, which has ample space for recreational purposes in bad weather, also ample space in a lean-to part thereof suitable for arrangement into classrooms.\n\nBy the use of the buildings mentioned a pupilage of 200 of both sexes and all ages could be accommodated providing sufficient staff, including 4 teachers, can be found.\n\nI have not discussed the proposed school with any of the officials of the Anglican Church and I am not certain whether it is the intention of the Department that the proposed school is to be operated under the auspices of the Anglican Church or not. I believe it would be a good opportunity for us to open a non-denominational residential school in order to carry out what seems to be the intent of the Parliamentary Committee and the wish of many of the Indians.\n\nI would recommend that the Department of Public Works be asked to immediately prepare for school purposes the buildings mentioned, and that steps be taken to secure, probably from the War Assets Corporation, the necessary beds, bedding, kitchen utensils and dishes, and that our Department should order 200 desks, 4 teachers' desks, and chairs, as well as the necessary furniture to furnish buildings Nos. 2 and 3 for living quarters. Two members of the school staff should be provided with sleeping quarters and necessary bedroom furniture that one male and one female member of the staff shall be able to sleep in the boys' and girls' dormitories respectively.\n\nIt would appear to me that the staff of this school for the present should consist of a Principal, a Matron, a Nurse, an Engineer, an Assistant Engineer, 4 teachers, a Kitchen Matron, a Girls' Supervisor, a Boys' Supervisor, a Sewing Matron, and a Gardener.\n\nThe grounds which will be made....\nThe grounds which will be made available for our purpose consist of a good playground space of 4 acres, and about 3\u00bd acres of orchard, garden, and nursery. The orchard and nursery would prove of great value to the school and is well worthy of the attention of a full-time man who would act as caretaker of the buildings in addition to the duties of a gardener.\n\nAmple accommodation can be found for housing the school staff mentioned by the use of Buildings No. 2 and 3, and one half of one of the dormitory buildings, either No. 23 or 29. Furniture and bedding should be secured for this purpose also.\n\nImmediately north of the orchard and nursery is an unused area of 40 acres. It could be secured in the future to enlarge the garden. It is good soil and suitable for gardening purposes by using water. The water for all purposes at the school will be supplied by the City of Prince Albert and is already connected. Power also is supplied by the City of Prince Albert.\n\nI believe that the Department of Public Works will have no great difficulty in having the necessary buildings prepared for our use at a not far distant date. More difficult will be the matter of securing staff.\n\nI should be glad to be advised of the Department's decision in the matter and to receive further instructions with regard thereto.\n\nJ.F.B.

CANON H.A. ALDERWOOD D.D.\n\nBANK STREET CHAMBERS\n102 BANK STREET\nOTTAWA\n\nSeptember 20, 1947.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey, Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYour letter of August 29th, file 132-2-5(WT), was forwarded to me in Saskatoon and I had the opportunity of placing your offer before the Executive Committee of our Missionary Society. I also took the opportunity of visiting Prince Albert and went over this place thoroughly in company with Principal Fisher of St. Alban's School.\n\nMay I say at once that I personally appreciate very much the consideration given to us in this matter and am clear that the buildings in the camp can be used satisfactorily for a school of at least one hundred children. I feel, however, that some amendment to the suggestions made by the Inspector and District Resident Architect would be required. The buildings which it is proposed should be used appear to us to be badly scattered and not at all suitable for the purpose. The drill hall, #27, might make a play place in the summer but the cost of heating such a huge building would be quite prohibitive with the income which we are likely to receive. Also, the use of buildings 2 and 3 as staff residences does not appear to us to be feasible as they are too far away from the children's quarters. It is to be hoped that building #34 may be obtained from the Provincial government as it is certainly in very much better condition than 33. We wonder why #30 is not proposed as it is included in the list of units handed over. It is a splendid building with classrooms already provided and an excellent gymnasium superior to anything which we have in the majority of our present schools. Our suggestion would be that buildings 29, 30, 33 and 34 should be made available and these four, which are close together, would form a workable combination. Our experience points to the necessity of concentrating both staff and children to make effective supervision possible. It would be very difficult for our workers to control the boys if they were passing between unused buildings and there is everything to be gained by having the buildings in close proximity.\n\nI shall be grateful if consideration may be given to our suggested amendments to the plan proposed by your officials.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6317 file 656-5, part 8)\nI may say frankly that our Executive met in a very disturbed state of mind by reason of the distressing financial state of our Administration. Our latest auditor's report showed that in spite of the increased per capita grant received this year we are running into a further heavy deficit. The rising cost of living seems to be always moving faster than our increase in income. In these circumstances, considerable alarm was expressed at the possibility that we should run into further losses in operating this proposed school in Prince Albert. This matter is being further discussed with the Bishop of Saskatchewan who is, of course, most anxious that provision should be made for the Lac la Ronge children. A factor which might decide the question is the amount of per capita grant which we might expect to receive, not only in '47 but also in '48 and I shall be grateful for any information you may be able to give in regard to this.\n\nThanking you and with kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.A.

Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nBasic Training Centre - Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.\n\nPlease find attached a rather disappointing letter from War Assets Corporation concerning the supplies required for operating the residential school in the above basic training centre.\n\nTo date we have received no reply to our letter of September 26 concerning this proposal.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: Basic Training Centre - Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 26th ultimo, File No. 132-2-5 (W T), in connection with the above, I have to say that the matter of the location and distribution of the buildings at Ex-Basic Training Centre No. 122 was given careful consideration before my original recommendation as those buildings best suitable for early use as an Indian residential school.\n\nBuilding No. 34 was recommended because it was a mess hall in good condition. Building No. 33 was not recommended because it was originally built for a mess hall but much of the interior furnishings had been removed. Since my original recommendation these furnishings have been replaced and both are now well equipped mess halls.\n\nI should point out that many of the buildings were in use when the matter was first considered, and I mentioned those not in use which could be used to advantage. I understand that all of the buildings have now been turned over to the Department of Public Works and some time in the not far distant future will all be available.\n\nI recommended Building No. 27, the drill hall, as a building which would provide classroom space and plenty of room for manual training, as well as a large floor space for recreation purposes during the winter, and in wet weather during the summer. I recommended Buildings Nos. 1 and 2, as they are both residences which could be made into staff quarters without much difficulty. However, any vacant building could be made into staff quarters, and any vacant building could be used for recreation purposes and manual training. In recommending the buildings in the first instance, I had in mind only those buildings which could be made available and useful in a short time at no great expense. However, I am not prepared to enter into a controversy with the Church Authorities as to which buildings should be used. I would say, however, that Buildings Nos. 33 and 34, which are now both fully equipped mess halls, with kitchen and washing facilities, should not be taken for school purposes. Either would furnish much more dining and kitchen space than we have in any of our present Indian residential schools and to destroy the usefulness of one of these buildings as a kitchen and mess hall, instead of taking one of the other buildings, either No. 20, 21, 22, or 23, would seem foolish.\n\nWith regard to Dr. Alderwood's remark about the cost of heating such a huge building as the drill hall No. 27, I made enquiries about this and as it has an excellent heating plant which provides a temperature of 50 to 55, which is sufficiently high for recreation purposes, I believe it would be just as economical to heat the one building, thus providing classroom space for manual training and space for recreation all under one roof, than to heat three other smaller buildings to supply the same accommodation.\n\nAlthough we are now considering opening this as a 100-pupil school its possibilities for the future are great, and there would be ample accommodation for several hundred pupils amongst the buildings which will shortly all be available. If the pupilage was increased to 300 or 400 some time in the future the drill hall would be a very necessary part of the school.\n\nApparently Dr. Alderwood........\nApparently Dr. Alderwood does not know what per capita grant there would be for this school, nor do I, but I do think that it has great possibilities for the future and would provide for a pupilage of 300 or even 500 children at a fraction of the cost of a new residential school to provide for the same pupilage.\n\nJ.P.B.

With regard to building No. 27, it has been decided to wait until the Principal of this school has been appointed and then let him decide whether he wishes to use this building. In the meantime we are also asking that it be reserved for us.\n\nThe delay in giving you a definite decision regarding the operation of this school is due to the fact that the M.S.C.C. is already considerably behind financially in the operation of its schools. Therefore Dr. Alderwood has been informed that a decision as to the operation of this school must await the visit of an Anglican deputation upon our Minister. We will keep you informed as to the results of this meeting. The point is, that the Church of England does not feel it can assume the obligation of operating another school while it is already losing so much money on the other schools it is running.\n\nBernard F.

Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nJFBO/ed\nEncl.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 30th ultimo, No. 132-2-5 (W T), Basic Training Centre, Prince Albert, I would strongly recommend that the Department make a definite request that Building No. 27, the drill hall, be retained for our use until a definite decision has been reached after the appointment of a Principal for the new school at Prince Albert.\n\nI am sure that the new Principal will see the wisdom of holding this building. It has a large lean-to which will supply plenty of classroom accommodation, and heating by an excellent steam heating plant which does not serve the main building. The heat of the main building is supplied by two separately fired, forced air, circulating, hot air units, either or both of which can be fired if the drill hall is needed for recreation purposes or for manual training.\n\nThe Department of Public Works has received a request to make this building available for another Department for the storage of implements but they wish to retain it for us, if instructed to do so. I would strongly recommend that instructions to that effect be issued.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nOttawa, November 12, 1947.\n\nBasic Training Centre - Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nDear General Turner:\n\nI understand that you discussed with the Superintendent of Education the problems which you have encountered in persuading the M.S.C.O. to operate a residential school in the above army camp. This matter has been presented to the Minister's office for consideration and we can now make you the following guarantees:\n\n(a) That there will be a pupilage at this school of 120.\n\n(b) That the per capita grant will be a basic rate of $200.00 (the rate formerly paid at the Lac la Ronge School) plus any additional special grants allowed by the Department.\n\n(c) That this school will be turned over to you as a complete functioning unit with full equipment, as is the case with a new residential school.\n\nTherefore, if your Society agrees to the operation of this school on the above terms, would you please have the Principal of your Prince Albert Residential School consult with the local Indian agent and together prepare a requisition covering the beds, sheets, tables, chairs, desks, kitchen equipment, furniture, blankets, etc., necessary to equip this school. It is felt that these two officials on the ground are better equipped to prepare such a requisition than anyone else.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMajor General G. H.

I shall place your letter before them and will advise you of the result as soon as possible. Should the M.S.C.C. agree to the terms contained in your letter, steps will be taken to instruct our Principal at Prince Albert to consult with your Agent regarding equipment of various kinds and with him prepare a joint requisition as you suggest.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nG.R. Turner\nMajor General G. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent.\n\nDICATED BUT NOT PERSONALLY SIGNED BECAUSE OF ABSENCE FROM THE OFFICE\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI have received a copy of your letter to the Acting Chief Architect, Department of Public Works, Ottawa, File 132-2-5, dated November 6th, 1947.\n\nIn this connection please refer to my letter of November 4th, 1947, file #1694-303-4A, wherein I pointed out that I had inadvertently referred to Building No. 32 when I should have referred to Building No. 28. I have communicated with Mr. Ramsay of the Department of Public Works, Saskatoon, informing him of the error, and that Building No. 28 is the building required by our Branch for Clerk's quarters, office and warehouse space. Apparently the Department letter to the Acting Chief Architect was forwarded before the receipt by the Department of my letter, dated November 4th.\n\nIn connection with taking over Building No. 28, as there was an excellent heating and sewage plant in the building we should make certain that they receive the best of care during the cold weather. It would be much better for Mr. E. S. Jones to move into Building No. 28, which is quite habitable, before any further work is done on it, and live there until authority is received to prepare that building and Building No. 9 for permanent use. If we do not do this it will be necessary to either winterize Building No. 28 at a considerable cost; or pay someone to take care of the fires in the building.\n\nI trust that funds can be made available at once for fuel and light in Building No. 28, in which case Mrs. Jones is prepared to live there for the winter at no other cost to the Department than the cost of fuel and light. As Mr. Jones is allowed these perquisites in the residence which he has been occupying at the Carlton Agency Headquarters on the Mistawasis Reserve, the fuel which has already been provided there will be kept for the use of another employee.\n\nAs there has been considerable delay in authorizing the work asked for I am assuming that it is the intention of the Department to delay this expenditure until Spring, which is my reason for making this alternative suggestion.\n\nThe winterizing of Building No. 9 will cost very little as it refers to sewage only. No damage will be done to the walls of the building, as the interior walls are now finished with ply-board.\n\nIf the suggestions as contained herein meet with the approval of the Department, please authorize Mr. Jones to submit a requisition for fuel for the winter heating of Building No. 28, and to submit monthly vouchers for electricity and telephone in the same building.\n\n(over)\nI should point out that the management of the present Carlton Agency can be carried out as well with Mr. Jones making his headquarters in Prince Albert as by his residing at the Indian Agency at Leask, as formerly. The banking of the Agency is done in Prince Albert, and Mr. Jones has to travel through Prince Albert in the winter when visiting most of his Reserves.\n\nJ. P. B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nOttawa, November 22, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS AND DEVELOPMENT.\nLac La Ronge Residential School.\n\nIt is our intention to include in our 1948-49 estimates, a sum for the erection of a Residential School at Lac La Ronge, Saskatchewan. The site for this school will be that previously used by the Church of England for the operation of the former school which was burned by fire two years ago. You are requested to prepare the plans and specifications for these buildings.\n\nThe pupilage to be provided for at this school will be one hundred and fifty (75 boys and 75 girls). Due to the isolation of this school, it is felt that frame construction should be used but that the dormitories should be in separate buildings, in order to minimize the danger of fire.\n\nIt is recommended that this school consist of the following buildings:\n\n(1) Boys' Dormitory Block:\n   (a) Sleeping Quarters for 60 boys\n   (b) Two staff rooms\n   (c) Wash rooms\n   (d) Recreation Room\n   (e) Manual Training Shop\n\nIt is suggested that this be a one storey building with a full basement. The sleeping quarters, staff rooms and wash rooms could be on the main floor with the recreation room and manual training shop in the basement.\n(2) Girls' Dormitory Block:\n\nThe general planning for this building would be the same as for the boys' dormitory block. The exception would, of course, be the manual training room which, in this building, would be replaced by a domestic science room. This room should have extra electrical outlets provided for a power sewing machine and electric rangettes.\n\n(3) Administration Building:\n\nThis would be a two storey building and would have a full basement. We would require the following rooms in this building:\n\n(a) Staff Quarters for eight.\n(b) Assembly Hall.\n(c) Kitchen and dining-rooms.\n(d) Wash rooms for use of school pupils and staff.\n(e) Power House (We are prepared to accept your recommendation that the power house should be located in a small building. It is felt that the whole unit should be steam heated from this power house).\n\n(4) Classroom Block:\n\nThis would be a standard four-room school previously designed by you for use at Eskasoni and Shubenacadie.\n\nIt is recommended that a meeting be held between your architects and our school officials to finalize the exact details of the buildings required.\n\nBFN/HH.\n\nDirector.\nNovember 25, 1947.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letters of October 15th, November 4th and November 18th in regard to the two buildings required for Indian Agency purposes, namely No. 9 and No. 28, which are among the buildings which we have requested the Department of Public Works to transfer to us for Indian Agency and Indian Education purposes, I would say that the reason we have not answered your letters or given any authority for any of the repairs or for the move into these buildings is that the Department of Public Works have not authorized the transfer.\n\nMiss Walton telephoned to the Department of Public Works several times last week and again this morning. This morning she was informed by Miss Cahoon in the office of Mr. Boucher, who looks after the leasing of public buildings, and this young lady informed Miss Walton that our Field Officer should get in touch with Mr. Thompson, District Resident Architect, Department of Public Works, Saskatoon. Miss Cahoon intimated that the matter rests in his hands. Miss Walton was informed that you had apparently been in touch with this Official and that, according to the information on our files, the District Resident Architect was approving of the transfer. However, we have on file a letter dated November 6th, signed by Mr. C.W. Jackson, Director, Administration and Personnel, Deputy Minister's office, to the Chief Architect, Department of Public Works, the last paragraph of whi...\n\"The requirements of the Indian Affairs Branch were referred to in our Deputy Minister's letter of the last ultimo to Mr. Murphy, and affect certain buildings located at Ex-122 Basic Training Centre. If, therefore, the accommodation requested, as outlined in our Deputy Minister's letter, could now be provided I think the same would be ample for our requirements. I believe this is fully understood by Inspector Ostrander and your District Resident Architect, who have reviewed the situation.\"\n\nFrom this letter it will be obvious that no transfer has yet taken place. Apparently the District Resident Architect has not yet made any recommendation to his Department or, if he has, his department has not acted upon it. In view of these circumstances I do not see how we can authorize either the move to Prince Albert, or any alterations to building No. 9.\n\nI would suggest that you communicate immediately with the District Resident Architect and ascertain just what steps he has taken and what our position is in the matter.\n\nSince writing the above Mr. Boucher's office telephoned to say that if the Resident Architect at Saskatoon had informed you that the transfer had been put through, that you could take possession of the buildings without further delay. Will you kindly wire me whether or not Mr. Thompson has authorized you to take possession.\n\nDirector\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fisher,\nSt. Alban's School,\nPrince Albert,\nSask.\n\nDear Mr. Fisher:\n\nYou will have received my letter of 25th November indicating that it had been decided that M.S.C.C. accept the offer of the Department that we administer the new temporary school at Prince Albert. I hope that it can be opened without undue delay.\n\nWith two schools in Prince Albert there is apt to be confusion unless we have some definite way of distinguishing them. Thesmuch, therefore, as the new temporary school is to provide accommodation for the children from Lac la Ronge, I think it would be well that we call it All Saints School. This would identify it with Lac la Ronge and at the same time distinguish it from St. Alban's and so avoid confusion.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. R. A. Hoey and to Canon House who is due to arrive in Ottawa tomorrow.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH. A. Duiven\n\nLAD K.\nAnglican Indian Residential School\n\nRev. W. Fisher,\nPrincipal.\n\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nNovember 25, 1947.\n\nMr. J. P. B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of November 24th, in reply to mine of the 22nd instant, I would say that I have today received word from Canon Dixon, General Secretary, M.S.C.C., Toronto, that at the request of Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, our Church Executive Committee has agreed to operate the proposed new school at Prince Albert, under the direction of our Indian School Administration.\n\nIt would appear therefore unnecessary to deal with the subject matter of our letters in the limited sense of providing accommodation for the number above 100, who should be removed to other sleeping quarters from this school, but rather to take such steps as are necessary to get the other school in operation as soon as possible. It is the desire of our Administration that I take steps to get the school in operation without delay. I should have mentioned that I have been asked to be Principal at the new school, as well as at St. Alban's.\n\nRegarding the 4th paragraph of my letter in which I mentioned providing the children with breakfast before leaving for classrooms at this school, I thought that with the set-up I had in mind, there would be no difficulty in providing a simple meal such as they would have had over here. It was my understanding, that you had already arranged for the purchase of sufficient utensils, cups, plates, etc., to take care of the number we proposed to house in one of the army buildings. Provided our Administration would have transferred them from Sioux Lookout, the married couple I had in mind, could have, I feel sure, taken care of the children together with the proposed meal. It is true, the meal idea was an afterthought.\n\nSince I have been asked to make arrangements for the opening of the school, I am wondering whether it will be possible for me to see you in the near future. Naturally, it would best for me to see you here, but if it would suit you better I could go to Regina to see you and talk over matters, if you will let me know what time would suit you best. I would like to get things moving as soon as possible, and to open the school at the beginning of the New Year. I know there are many things to be dis-\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant in connection with the over-crowding of St. Alban's school, and in particular to the fourth paragraph thereof, it was not my understanding in conversation that it was proposed to supply meals to the children at the Annex. If you do this the matter of getting utensils, dishes, and a cook will have to be considered. Would it not be advisable to use one of the buildings at the Army Camp for sleeping quarters only, as I think that is the most important issue at the present time.\n\nPlease give this consideration and write me again in the matter before I refer it to Ottawa for approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) J. P. B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nRev. G. W. Fisher,\nPrincipal Anglican Indian Residential School,\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan.\nThe Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nDominion of Canada Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to our conversation of last evening, in which you informed me you felt it your duty to report to the Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, the overcrowded condition of this school, and to suggest that all children in excess of 100 be returned to their homes, I beg to submit the following counter-proposal.\n\nThat in view of the fact, it is the desire of the Indian Affairs Branch that certain buildings once used as Army Barracks be taken over and operated as an Indian Residential school, the management of this school be authorized to take over one of these buildings in question (deemed to be the most suitable for the purpose) and to operate the same as an annex to this school, to be used as a Boys' Dormitory.\n\nIf authority is given by the Indian Affairs Branch to do this I shall suggest to Indian School Administration, M.S.C.C., 102 Bank Street, Ottawa, that under the direction of the Principal of St. Alban's school, this annex be in the care of a competent married couple, to be appointed by the Administration.\n\nIt is my idea that the children so housed would have their breakfast at the annex, after which they would be transported to St. Alban's by truck, remaining all day for classroom work, etc. and then after supper be returned by truck to the annex.\n\nI strongly feel it would not be in the best interests of the children involved to be sent back to their homes at this time of the year, after having been admitted to a Residential school with the intention of remaining the entire year at the school.\n\nIt will be very much appreciated if you will bring this proposal to the Indian Affairs Branch as early as possible. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to our administration for their information.\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) G.W. Fisher\nPrincipal\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copies of letters dated November 22nd and November 25th from Rev. G. W. Fisher, Principal of the Anglican Indian Residential School, Prince Albert, together with a copy of my letter to Mr. Fisher, dated November 24th, 1947.\n\nWhen visiting the Indian Residential school at Prince Albert (known as St. Alban's school) I found that the dormitories in the building are again over-crowded notwithstanding the fact that the, then, principal, Rev. Henry Ellis had been instructed to reduce the pupilage to 100 because of the crowded dormitories. In the discussion Mr. Fisher proposed having all the pupils in excess of 100 live in one of the buildings recently taken over at Ex 122, Basic Training Centre, Prince Albert, I concurred with the suggestion and asked him to make the proposal in writing through this office. When his proposal came in his letter of the 22nd instant he introduced another matter with which I could not agree, namely: serving meals at Ex 122 Basis Training centre. His letter of the 25th instant is in reply to my letter of the 24th.\n\nI realize that there will be some delay in establishing the new school at Prince Albert, and in the meantime the dormitories at the old school will be over-crowded to the detriment of the children sleeping in them, also increasing the fire hazard. Please advise me whether or not I should insist that sufficient of the children be returned to their homes to reduce the number in residence to 100, pending the opening of the new school. These extra children should not have been admitted to the school, but they are there now and there will be some difficulty in contacting their parents with a view to returning them to their homes.\n\nWith regard to that part of Mr. Fisher's letter where he refers in the third paragraph to the purchase of cooking utensils, etc., I have to say that I located a quantity of these utensils which could be purchased from a surplus in the hands of the Provincial Government, Department of Rehabilitation, taken over by them from War Assets Corporation. A list of these utensils was prepared and is held in this office as I am awaiting unit prices from the official in charge here in Regina. Mr. Fisher misunderstood me when he says that he understood that arrangements were made for their purchase. I proposed submitting the list to the Department and recommending their purchase as soon as prices have been received. I expected to receive these prices today but they have not yet arrived. The list is not the complete requirements for opening a school of 120 pupils. Some of the articles were in sufficient quantity for our requirements, others were not. As soon as authority has been received to take over the utensils in question I intend to check over the list with Mr. Fisher, ascertain what further quantities are required, and submit the necessary requisition to the Department.\n\nI have not yet been officially informed that the proposed school will be operated in the near future. I note that Mr. Fisher's letter indicates that a definite arrangement has been made.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nIndian Affairs.

According to information received from Mr. R. J. Bruce, Housing Manager, the prices shown on the list are their cost prices from War Assets Corporation.\n\nI would recommend that arrangements be made to take over this equipment from the Department of Reconstruction and Rehabilitation and to store it in the warehouse which we now have as part of building No. 28 Kx 122, Basic Training Centre, where it will be in charge of Mr. E. S. Jones, Indian Agent.\n\nIf the Department confirms taking over the equipment in accordance with this list I shall then check it over with Rev. G.W. Fisher, who I understand is to be the principal of the combined school, then prepare a Requisition for the remainder of the school requirements.\n\nJ. P. B.

Present were:\n\nReverend Canon John W. House (formerly Principal, Old Sun's Residential School and temporarily filling the position formerly held by the late Dr. Alderwood),\n\nGeneral Turner, of the M.S.C.C.,\n\nMr. Phelan and myself.\n\nCanon House seemed reluctant to accept the operation of the residential school in the Prince Albert army buildings until he had investigated the situation there himself. We impressed upon him the necessity for a definite decision in this matter and it is understood that he will be leaving for Prince Albert in the near future.\n\nI have asked him to contact you ahead of time and to discuss the situation with you when he is in\nSaskatchewan. I have pointed out to him that there will be considerable pressure from (a) our own Department of Public Works as to the disposal of the buildings and (b) from the Saskatchewan Department of Reconstruction and Rehabilitation concerning the sale of the equipment listed in your letter. I have requested, therefore, that he inform the Department as soon as a definite decision has been reached by the M.S.C.C. concerning the operation of this school.\n\nBernard F.

Fisher and Mr. Jones the matter\nof further equipment necessary before the school can be opened.\n\nEnclosed is a list of further equipment asked for by Mr. Fisher,\nalso some catalogue sheets showing laundry machinery which can be purchased\nfrom J. H. Connor & Son, Limited, Ottawa, and which could be seen by an\nofficial of our Department to decide whether or not it is suitable.\n\nThe only prices shown by me on this list are the quotations on\nthe laundry machinery and labour for manufacturing lockers for the children's\nclothing.\n\nI would ask that this list be carefully examined and that any\nunapproved items be deleted. Also that I be instructed as to the manner by\nwhich it is intended to make the purchases. If it is by means of Requisition\nForm 37 I would like to be informed whether or not there should be some sub-\ndivision of the requisitions.\n\nWe discussed the question of partitions, flooring, etc. in the\nbuildings which it has been decided we would use. There will be some expense\nin connection with building partitions, repairing floors, and re-arrangement\nof plumbing. I have asked Mr. Norman Thompson, District Resident Architect,\nDepartment of Public Works, Saskatoon, to assist us in securing the plan,\npreparing an estimate and getting a quotation on this necessary work. As soon\nas this part of the preparation has been completed I shall communicate further\nwith the Department.\n\nJ.P.B.

The stables could be converted to house cattle, a few of which could be pastured nearby.\n\nThere are buildings which could be used as heated poultry houses.\n\nIn addition to the pasture land there is some ground which looks good enough to grow a worthwhile stock of vegetables for which there is no problem of water supply.\n\nThere are some fruit trees which might be responsive to proper care.\n\nAs Prince Albert is a point of departure for tourists to and from the Northern park lands, a handicraft shop in the city could be organized to dispose of articles made by the pupils at the school.\n\nIn addition to the laundry chores necessary for the institution itself, the school might branch out into a laundry, mending and dry cleaning business for the town. I did not myself find that these services were superior at Prince Albert.\n\nThe curriculum need not anticipate anything beyond High School Entrance. If they go beyond this it would be\nto the pupils' and the Department's advantage to have them attend the High School, the course of study for which is being modernized and enlarged. The province, moreover, makes a grant towards the cost of attendance of high school pupils from out of town. As the parents of these children would be non-residents of Prince Albert, the children would qualify even though they continue to reside at the residential school.\n\nAs, however, most of the boys will be in the intermediate grades it should be possible by arrangement with the Prince Albert School Board to obtain the services of a part time Instructor in technical subjects. Similar arrangements, no doubt, could be made in subjects proper for the girls.\n\nC.A.F.

Ross, Regional Director, C.V.T.S., Regina, with a view to having it turned over to our Branch. Mr. Ross has now received a letter from the Director of Training, Mr. R.W. Thompson, Department of Labour, Ottawa, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"....the following procedure would have to be adopted:\n\n(1) The Province would have to purchase this lumber from the Dominion Department of Labour, and send a cheque for the same to this office, payable to the Receiver General of Canada.\n\n(2) The Province would then bill the Dominion Department of Mines and Resources for this same amount, which would be paid by the Department of Mines and Resources to the Province of Saskatchewan.\"\n\nI do not understand the reason for such a procedure. No doubt the province would be glad to purchase this well seasoned lumber at considerably below the market price at which it is now available for sale. I have grave doubt that they would then agree to resell it to our Branch for the same money, if at all. I am very anxious to secure this lumber as it has been well seasoned under cover for a year, and is in excellent condition. The price which we would be paying for it, if taken over direct from the Department of Labour, is about 80% of the current retail price of lumber, and it is all useful for building purposes in our building program for the coming fiscal year.\n\nI would be glad if enquiry could be made from Mr. Thompson as to the reason why this lumber cannot be transferred direct from the Department of Labour to our Department, and I have no hope that we will get it by the means he suggests. The matter is urgent because Mr. Ross has to make immediate disposal of the lumber, and I would ask that I be advised at the earliest possible date as to the action which it is proposed to take. The quantity of lumber is approximately 66,000 ft. and consists of dimension lumber, common boards, shiplats, etc.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nColonel Henry:\n\nLumber available at Prince Albert:\n\nMr. Thompson, Director of Training, Dept. of Labour, re-affirmed yesterday afternoon that he cannot depart from the procedure quoted in the letter from Mr. Ostrander dated Jan. 7th. I suggested the War Assets procedure, but Mr. Thompson is quite familiar with that and does not wish to implement it in this case. It seems that there is no reason to expect difficulties in the negotiations with the provincial government or its officials with whom his own relations have been entirely pleasant.\n\nMr. Thompson said that the reason for the procedure quoted arises from Treasury rules. I think we may safely advise Mr. Ostrander to get Mr. Ross at Regina to proceed as required.\n\nThe amount involved appears likely to be upwards of $4,000.\n\nC.A.

He re-affirmed the decision given to Mr. Ross, namely that he cannot depart from the procedure outlined in your letter. Major Clark suggested the adoption of the War Assets procedure but Mr. Thompson is quite familiar with this arrangement and does not wish to implement it in this case. He feels that there is no reason to anticipate difficulties in the negotiations with the Provincial Government or its officials, with whom his own relations have been entirely pleasant and satisfactory. Mr. Thompson said that the reason for the procedure quoted arises from Treasury regulations. Before proceeding any further with this purchase, it will be necessary for us to have an estimate of the amount involved. Due to the lateness of the fiscal year, our appropriation is running low at the present time and we must have definite information as to costs in this instance.\n\nBernard F.

C.V.T.S.\n\nI am informed by Mr. W.A. Ross, Regional Director, that a valuation of $4091.46 was placed on the lumber and building material based on an inventory taken by Indian Agent Mr. E.S. Jones and a representative of Mr. Ross, the Regional Director.\n\nI have not an inventory of the lumber as it was turned over to Mr. Ross in triplicate for him to insert the price, and the whole has been forwarded by him to his headquarters in Ottawa.\n\nMr. Thompson may feel that there is no reason to anticipate difficulties in negotiations with the Provincial Government with regard to taking over this lumber and building material. The Saskatchewan Government has already made an effort to buy the lumber, with no thought of reselling to our Department. It should be remembered that the Government of the Province of Saskatchewan is in the lumber business, buying it and reselling it at a profit, therefore I do not expect it will be resold to us without a profit. However, I have no control over the lumber, and if it has to be handled in the way Mr. Thompson requires, I would ask that he kindly sell the lumber to the Provincial Government and ask them to submit a voucher in triplicate, through this office, for the amount of $4091.46, in order that we may reimburse them in full for the lumber, and thereby have full possession.\n\nJ.P.B.

Over $3,000. was spent in purchasing the kitchen ware, blankets, etc. from the Provincial Government.\n\nThe equipment asked for in your letter of December 23 will amount to another five or six thousand dollars. Therefore, we will be unable to purchase this lumber from the funds provided as mentioned above.\n\nTherefore, we would like to take the $4,091.46 from the funds provided in this year's vote for the construction of day schools in Saskatchewan.

Inspector Ostrander was unable to get anyone to construct this building during the current fiscal year.\n\nI enclose copy of letter of November 7th, 1947 received from Mr. Ostrander, also a further letter dated January 7th, 1948. In reply to the latter letter we wrote Inspector Ostrander on January 12th and I enclose copy of this letter. We received his reply dated January 19th, copy of which is also enclosed. Our reply of January 26th asked for further information. In reply to the latter letter Mr. Ostrander has written under date of February 2nd (copy of this letter is attached) and enclosed voucher for $4,091.46.\n\nIf the lumber and building materials shown on the account are secured, it is our intention to have them stored so that they can be used for the construction of the Chitek Lake school during the coming summer.\n\nFunds for the purpose are available in Vote 516, Allotment 13-491.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Jones, Carlton Agency, in which he asks for instructions in regard to the disposal of the Electric Light Batteries (32 volt) salvaged from the former school at Lac la Ronge.\n\nMr. Jones estimates the batteries are used to the extent of approximately 50% of their normal usefulness, this being the case it would be advisable to ship them to another point if needed rather than to sell as there is not a ready market for used batteries because of the fact it is difficult to accurately estimate the unused life of the lead plates. While these batteries are kept in storage there is some depreciation and some expense to the Department.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Jones be given authority to obtain offers from any interested parties and sell to the highest bidder unless they can be used to advantage at some other point, in the event of a transfer this should be done as soon as possible.\n\nPlease instruct Mr. Jones.\n\nJ.P.B.

In order that the information on our files may be complete, I would like to know if any charge was laid against John Roberts and if so, whether he was found guilty or innocent. If the former, we would like to know what sentence he was given. What does the term \"indefinite period\" mean in the case of Bird? An early reply would be appreciated.\n\nBernard F.

On the 29th of October, 1947, Kitchener Bird was sentenced as indicated in police report and Department letter. On December 3rd, 1947, he was transferred to the Indian Hospital at Fort Qu'Appelle where he remained until February 23rd, 1948, when he was returned to his home on the reserve. Apparently the use of the term \"indefinite period\" is common in this province when sentencing boys to the Industrial School, and simply means that it is left to the discretion of the School Superintendent and Provincial Welfare officers to decide termination, in the best interest of the boy.\n\nThe R.C.M. Police file is still incomplete with regard to John Roberts. My last information in this connection was to the effect that the N.C.O., in Charge, R.C.M. Police, at Lac la Ronge, is to make arrangements for the hearing when the boy is located.

I think there is no need for me at this time to repeat our opinions with regard to the situation. Perhaps I might mentioned that we had previously sent a list of communities in which in our opinion we might well work together to provide the necessary services.\n\nI am raising the matter again as a result of the recent announcement that your Department is going to build certain new schools for the use of our Indian population. We have particularly noted the proposal with regard to a new six-room school at Lac la Ronge. Might I suggest that as a result of this development we would be more than interested in renewing conversations with regard to co-operation in this field. Using Lac la Ronge as an example we would like to suggest that some plan be worked out whereby the Dominion Government would make arrangements to construct and operate a dormitory and provide the facilities in a separate building for carrying on the educational classes. We have no wish to participate in the dormitory operation. We do feel that it would be an advantage if arrangements could be made whereby the school could be operated in conjunction with our new school at that point. I may say that we have almost completed the construction of a new school at Lac la Ronge and this school is constructed in such a way that almost any number of additional classrooms might be added. With an eight-room school at such a point I am sure you will agree that excellent educational services could be provided.\n\nI know from our previous correspondence and in conversations that you are in agreement with the plan of treating all our citizens in the north on a similar basis.\nIt would seem to us that we have at this time an excellent opportunity to further coordinate our activities and consequently make them more effective. I may say that the officials of the Saskatchewan Government who work in this area feel that such a plan would put into effect the wishes of the people who live in that area.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) W.S.

This viewpoint is supported by the Right Reverend Henry D. Martin, Anglican Bishop of Saskatchewan, and by the former Principal of the School, the Reverend D.C. Wickenden.\n\n(b) That we rebuild the school closer to Prince Albert, possibly in the area of the Little Red River Reserve. On the Reserve just mentioned a suitable site can be obtained. The cultivation of this land would produce the vegetables required for use at the school and also the raising of cattle, hogs, etc., for food purposes. This could not be done in the Lac la Ronge area. This viewpoint is supported by our Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan, Mr. Ostrander, and Mr. Indian Agent Jones.\nIn view of the above divergent recommendations, the whole situation is still under consideration.\n\nIt is our intention to have our Educational Survey Officer go to Saskatchewan in the third week of April to interview Bishop Martin and ascertain whether he is still as determined as previously to press for the rebuilding of the school at Lac la Ronge.\n\nI also understand that Mr. Matte, of the Prime Minister's Office, has phoned our Superintendent of Education and advised that the people of Prince Albert are anxious to have the school built near that city. In view of these considerations, we have not attempted to answer the Honourable Mr. Lloyd's letter but are presenting the facts to you, as stated above.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/EGD\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have filled in the attached forms to the best of my ability, but most of the measurements have been taken from the machinery at present in use here.

It would need to be completely overhauled, but I would suggest that you get in touch with Mr. Davis and arrange to have this boiler transferred here for the Lac la Ronge School.

Keenleyside:\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Keenleyside:\n\nThe Session of our Legislature prorogued on Thursday last\nand I am now endeavouring to catch up on some of my correspondence.\n\nA short time ago I noticed an announcement in the Saskatoon\nStar-Phoenix by your Minister, the Honourable J. A. Glen. This\nwas to the effect that some 80 new schools would be constructed\nin the near future for Indians and that one of these would be\nlocated at Lac la Ronge.\n\nI can hardly believe this report is correct and I am, there-\nfore, taking the liberty of writing you a personal letter in\nthis regard. As you know the Provincial Government has had a\npublic school in the process of construction for over a year at\nLac la Ronge and I understand it will be completed this summer.\nAs you are possibly aware last summer we appointed a Northern\nAdministrator and at the end of this Session assent was given to\na Bill to provide a special administrative set-up for the\nNorthern half of the Province, the areas of which have been\nespecially designated for this purpose. The Northern Administrator\nis also much concerned regarding this situation.\n\nIt is our hope and desire to treat the Indians the same as\nany other citizens of our Province. While education is not the\nresponsibility of our Department, nevertheless under this new\nAct the general administration of the North is and since reading\nthis announcement I have been wondering if it is not possible to\nwork out some plan of a joint approach to this problem of education\nin the North. We have worked out a very satisfactory joint fur\ndevelopment programme and I cannot see why a similar approach\ncould not be extended into the field of education. It would not\nonly be much more economical, but it is believed it would be more\nefficient and even more important is the fact that by having two\nschools in the same area false divisions are created immediately\nin the minds of the children. This applies both to white and\nnative children and it is felt establishes the wrong relationship\nfrom the very beginning. In other words I personally feel the\nBest method of fitting people to live together in later life is to have them attend the same schools - together they can learn much from each other; otherwise we set up by our own actions the very divisions we are all seeking to eliminate.\n\nThe writer can fully appreciate that there are groups who would have a special interest in seeing the system of separate educations continue. However, even under the best of planning, educational services in the Northern areas are bound to require the expenditure of substantial public funds and it is thought we will all be rightfully subject to severe criticism if we encourage unnecessary duplication.\n\nI have already been asked to make a press statement, but intend to refrain from so doing until I have learned the facts. A copy of the press announcement in question is being attached hereto for your information.\n\nIf for some reason, known or unknown, complete co-operation between the two Departments concerned cannot be obtained, which I would be reluctant to accept as being the case, then as an alternative I would strongly urge an immediate conference with a view to eliminating duplication and properly allocating the different areas, in order that each settlement will be adequately served and thus correct the present situation where in some areas a large number of school children are without facilities of this nature.\n\nReceipt of your reply would be greatly appreciated and I shall continue to refuse making any public comment until same arrives.\n\nWith kindest personal regards, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(signed) J. L. Phelps,\n\nMinister of Natural Resources and Industrial Development.\n\nJLP: BHG\nTRANSMITTAL SLIP\n\nTO: DIA\n\nFROM:\n\n\u2610 Note and Return\n\u2610 Please Speak\n\u2610 Please Answer\n\u2610 For Your Approval\n\u2610 Prepare Reply For My Signature\n\n\u2610 Take Appropriate Action\n\u2610 As Requested\n\u2610 For Information\n\u2610 For Your Comments\n\u2610 For Signature\n\nCOMMENTS:\nI am not prepared to answer this letter until I have discussed the situation with you.\n\nIndian Affairs.

My impression is that such action is not now possible and that we will have to await the passing of the new Indian Act. It would therefore seem advisable, if such is the case, to inform the Honourable Mr. Phelps of this fact.\n\nIn view of the fact that this is a personal letter to Dr. Keenleyside, it is suggested that the Honourable Mr. Phelps be advised that his letter is being held for the Deputy Minister's immediate attention upon his return to Ottawa.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I appreciate the interest you are taking in the educational problems of the Indians and half-breeds in the northern part of the Province.\n\nI might say an item was included in the estimates for the current year to replace the educational facilities that were lost when the fire destroyed the Residential School at Lac la Ronge. No definite plans have yet been decided upon as to what shall be done. There has been a suggestion that a school might be more conveniently located elsewhere. However, the whole matter is under consideration and you can rest assured we will keep your views in mind.\n\nWe plan to have our educational survey officer go to Saskatchewan before the end of this month to discuss the problem with the Church authorities. He is being instructed to see you. I hope you will be able to spare the time to grant him an interview in order that the whole matter may be gone into.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Minister.\n\nThe Honourable W.S. Lloyd,\nMinister of Education,\nREGINA, Saskatchewan.\nMINERAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN OFFERS AID TO PROSPECTORS\n\nREGINA.\u2014Up to 40 men will be assisted by the provincial government in carrying out prospecting activities in Saskatchewan's Precambrian Shield under support of the government's new mineral development policy, Resources Minister J. L. Phelps announced recently.\n\nApplications from individuals or partnerships may be submitted by March 31, said the minister, who added that interested parties must submit at least one letter of recommendation from a former employer. \"Prospectors with mining experience and anxious men with bush or service experience\" are required.\n\nProspectors may make any deal they wish with individuals without obtaining permission from the government, Mr. Phelps said.\n\nCash awards will be made for discoveries on the basis of 2\u00bd per cent of the value of the property located and underground development during the three-year period starting from January 1, 1948, until December 31, 1950. Samples for assay will be picked up twice during the season, at Friday Lake and a government geologist will spend a few days with each party.\n\nProspectors will be flown into the bush country from La Loche Range or Pilot Flats. They will gather at these two points where they will then all have an opportunity to choose partners for the season. Equipment will be obtained by depositors so that each prospector will be completely outfitted within five days, including tents, fuel, food supplies, Mr. Phelps said.\n\nA $100 bond must be deposited with the department of natural resources at each location.\n\nHospital Plan Gets Boost\n\nREGINA\u2014Mossebank resident Dr. D. Mott has expressed his appreciation in a letter to Dr. J. L. Mott, chairman of the Health Services Planning Commission, in which he said he was grateful to help defray the costs of the plan.\n\nAnswering a questionnaire concerning the improvement of hospital care, the patient said: \"The treatment I received at hospital was excellent\u2014a wonderful work is being done here. This hospital is one of my dreams come true.\"\n\nDr. Mott said the $10 contribution made by the Mossebank patient has been deposited in the Saskatchewan Hospital Services Fund to help defray the costs of the plan.\n\nNatural Resources Posts For Churchman, Roney\n\nREGINA\u2014Appointment of J. W. Churchman as assistant deputy minister of natural resources for Saskatchewan was announced recently by Hon. J. L. Phelps. Mr. Churchman, formerly executive assistant in the Natural Resources Department, was appointed by a special order-in-council.\n\nMr. Churchman's successor as executive assistant will be W. A. Roney. The appointment to the new post was made at the same time by the Saskatchewan public service commission. Mr. Churchman was appointed technician with the commission.\n\nMr. Phelps said the post of assistant deputy minister was a newly-created position but was one which had been vacant since former assistant deputy minister G. C. MacKinnon was appointed deputy minister in the fall of 1947. The vacancy in the assistant deputy minister's post had been delayed since that time because a suitable replacement could not be found when one was not available, he said.\n\nA native of Saskatchewan, Mr. Churchman received his school and university training at Saskatoon. After graduation he taught school for part of that time as school principal at Cutknife.\n\nEnlisting in the R.C.A.F. during the Second World War, he served three years as an instrument mechanics instructor, and following his discharge joined the staff of the natural resources Department in June, 1946, as chief clerk.\n\nHe became executive assistant a short time later, and last fall served as acting deputy minister in addition to his other duties. As assistant deputy minister, he will have his headquarters in Regina.\n\nMr. Roney, who was born at Bulyea, Saskatchewan, received his B.A. degree from the University of Saskatchewan and spent one half year in the southern part of the province. Discharged after four years' service in the R.C.A.F., he was a navigational instructor in Canada and the United Kingdom, he was employed in the Saskatchewan province's civil service and later with the public service commission as a technician.\n\nEducation tax receipts for the current fiscal year to Feb. 28, 1949, totalled $6,125,484. Provincial Treasurer C. M. Pines informed Opposition Leader W. J. Patterson.\n\nOil Production Now Quadrupled\n\nREGINA\u2014February oil production in the Saskatchewan section of the Lloydminster field was almost four times that of February, 1947, Natural Resources Minister J. L. Phelps said recently. Output from 77 wells totalled 45,123 barrels daily compared with 11,513 barrels from the 19 wells which were operating in the Saskatchewan section in February, 1947.\n\nDaily production during the month averaged 2,323 barrels, a slight decrease from the January 31 daily average output of 2,372 barrels.\n\nDue to unfavorable weather conditions, there was little activity in the field during February, Mr. Phelps said, adding that exploration and development is expected to increase with the coming of warmer weather.\n\nOver 290,000 family heads and single persons were liable for payment of the hospitalization tax in 1947, according to an announcement given by Dr. Douglas, minister of health, in reply to a question by A. T. Murray (Saskatoon). Ninety-five persons who paid the tax totalled 285,037. Cases submitted for refund by the minister's department to enforce payment numbered 62, and 27 of these paid before prosecution was begun.\nHouse Approves $52,221,000 Budget; Fines Raps Liberal Gas Dye Contract\n\nSaskatchewan's $52,221,000 budget proposed by Provincial Treasurer C. M. Fines for 1948-49 has been passed by a recorded 43-4 vote, winding up 12 days of debate in which 55 speakers took part.\n\nFinal address was made by Mr. Fines who reviewed criticisms directed at the budget by Opposition Leader W. J. Patterson and reassured charges that the Liberal administration had condoned the \"wasting of public funds\" through a \"dumpy\" purple gas dye company. He tabled correspondence, vouchers and invoices in connection with the dye deal.\n\nOpposition members voted against the budget while 43 \"yes\" votes on the budget. Voting against it were: Opposition Leader Patterson; A. T. Proctor (Lib-Moose Jaw); P. J. Hooper (Lib-Rosthern); L. M. Martin (Lib-Alta-Abasand); G. H. Danielson (Lib-Prince Albert).\n\nOf the three Armed Services members in the house D. S. Vallee voted for the budget while M. J. Dobie and A. W. Embury were not present when the vote was taken.\n\nWhile admitting that the present government had made a \"political mistake\" in granting road-building contracts last year to K. Schan, president of the Saskatchewan Co-operative Wholesale Society, Mr. Fines told the house that the contracts had been \"corrected.\"\n\nIn reply to charges by Mr. Embury that the contracts had been granted to Mr. Schan who had no equipment nor experience in road building, Mr. Fines said that the contractor and his foreman had been dismissed from the job under the contract. They have done the best work they could in the short time given them season at a cost of only 87 cents per yard, he declared.\n\nMr. Danielson had said reduction of the public debt by 32 per cent by using the proceeds of the sale of bonds, telephones, co-operative insurance and liquor profits was not commendable, especially since the money had been in the hands of the province's governments, and had used them to reduce the public debt.\n\nMr. Fines replied that the government always added to the debt.\n\nThe Opposition claimed that while the government had voted $12,096,000 in capital expenditures in 1948-49, this represented only one per cent increase over what the previous administration had made a 22 per cent error in estimating.\n\nHe attributed the 1947 error largely to the fact that the government had run all its business for 1946 during that year and much was carried over into 1947.\n\nThe Opposition also charged the Saskatchewan Power Commission and Government Telephones than less money was being spent on these services than the government had promised.\n\nMr. Fines said in answer to the charge that the power commission had incorporated into the government finance department the revenue from the power commission until 1939. For the years following 1939 the government had been insufficient and this was why the government was now having to pay a 2.4 per cent rate increase.\n\nWhile cabinet ministers' expenses had been increased by 10 per cent, this comparison was unfair, Mr. Fines said. In addition, there had been several Dominion-provincial conferences between the minister of trade and commerce and the Cooperative Minister L. F. Douglas, and the minister had been in an endeavor to improve trade between Saskatchewan and the Dominion.\n\nActual expenditures on the economic planning board were $16,702, and not the $25,000 claimed by the Opposition.\n\nEstimated revenues from Crown corporations for 1948-49 are $809,000, or 10 per cent of their total income, Mr. Fines said.\n\n\"It's pretty good,\" Mr. Fines said.\n\nThe amount of money that had been increased a large part of the increase was due to the expansion of the capital, where employees formerly worked from 44 to 48 hours a week but now worked from 44 to 48 hours a week.\n\nDuring his address Mr. Fines tabled correspondence, vouchers and invoices to support charges by Premier T. C. Douglas that the Liberal administration had paid out $40,000 more for purple gas dye than it was worth in the years 1940-42.\n\nThe money had been paid to a company owned by a fellow Liberal, Peter E. Douglas, who had been charged, stating that the company had been paid $15,000 for \"just a letterhead.\"\n\nMr. Fines said the color tax-free gas for farm machinery\u2014had been purchased for $3.55 per pound, by a Winnipeg firm, whereas the same product bought in Edmonton, it was bought from the \"dumpy\" firm.\n\nMr. Fines charged Col. L. S. Sifton, former minister of health, with obstruction, with full knowledge of the overcharges.\n\nThe civil servant charged with signing vouchers for the dye was dismissed so recently, Mr. Fines said. From that time forward the minister had refused to sign any vouchers.\n\nMr. Fines did not\u738b\u8005\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u89e3\u96c7\uff0c\u4ed6\u88ab\u6307\u63a7\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5145\u5206\u4e86\u89e3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e86\u4e00\u5f20\u4ef7\u503c$15,000\u7684\u7d2b\u8272\u67d3\u6599\u53d1\u7968\u3002\n\nPatronage Said Used for Votes\n\nSocial Welfare Minister C. W. Vallee charged the former Liberal administration with favoring Liberal supporters in the distribution of food stamps, pensions, mother's allowances and civil service appointments.\n\nSpeaking in the legislative debate, Mr. Vallee read to the house an application for a new drug commission in which the applicant said that the drug was needed by the hospital immediately which has assisted in Liberal campaigns for many years.\n\nVallee said the applicant received a Dominion average of 31 cents per card.\n\nSaskatchewan reported the lowest mortality rate in Canada for the period between the months April and June 1948, according to a minister reported. He attributed this record to the improvement in the hospital tests and distribution of free drugs to all physicians and patients of the province.\n\nA drop in the infant death rate was noted in the report for the period from 1936 to 1946 was also reported. In 1936 the rate was 63.9 in 1946 and 48.4 in 1946. During the same period the infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births dropped from 11.4 to 7.4.\n\nHighest police incidence since 1937 was reported by the minister of communities, Mr. Douglas, during 1947. During the first 11 months of 1947 cases of drunkenness increased by 15 per cent, while the number of arrests for drunkenness increased by 15 per cent.\n\nSaskatchewan's Air Ambulance Service was also mentioned by the minister during his speech.\n\nProctor Expelled After Statement\n\nA. T. Proctor, Liberal member for Moose Jaw, was expelled from the March 10 sitting of the house when he called Premier Douglas a \"dumpy, sniveling skunk\" and refused to withdraw the statement.\n\nMr. Proctor made the reference in reply to Premier Douglas concerning a \"dumpy\" statement made by Mr. Douglas.\n\nMr. Proctor had been opposed by prominent members of the Liberal party men and had been criticized by the minister during the years 1940-42.\n\nWhen the motion came when the house voted 43-4 to support a motion by Mr. Proctor to expel him, it was stated that the member for Moose Jaw be expelled from the house forthwith and the day.\n\nThe motion was seconded by Municipal Affairs Minister J. H. Brookes.\n\nPremier Douglas was in the house when the statement was made.\n\nDuring the March 5 sitting Premier Douglas had stated that a company called Canadian Purple Dye and Chemical had sold purple gas dye to the provincial government for $15,000 during 1940-42 for $60,159 more than it was worth.\n\nMr. Proctor said he was unable to farm the land with no drainage or irrigation facilities and that he were given the opportunity to purchase the land after a fixed period.\n\nBenson Urges Financial Reserves for Bad Years\n\nAt least $15,000,000 of the proposed $43,000,000 budget for 1948-49 should be put aside toward reserves in times of emergency, Mr. Benson (P.C., Last Mountain) told the legislature during the budget debate.\n\nWhile he approved the budget, Mr. Benson thought that the heavy expenditure on highways was too extensive for the Dominion government to build during the present period of buoyant trade and prosperity and that the initial expenditures in \"good times\" and not during the present period.\n\nSaskatchewan's economy was almost entirely dependent upon wheat production which reached all-time high prices during the past few years. Between the years 1945-47 this production averaged $125,000,000 annually.\n\nHowever, the average production during the past two years had been $215,000,000 and Mr. Benson said that the budget should be revised downward accordingly.\n\nWhile he landed such crops as potatoes, Saskatchewan Telephones and the Saskatchewan Transportation Com-\n\npany were \"natural monopolies,\" the financial reserves contemplated by the government were unimportant to its subjects.\n\nThe Saskatchewan highway system was too extensive for its resources, he said, and called for federal aid in this matter.\n\nThe Dominion government should build only those highways necessary for emergencies and \"we will take care of the rest.\"\n\nMr. Benson said that the province was undergoing a period of depression and was largely capable of supporting itself.\n\nHe believed that previous charges by opposition members that the government was attempting to socialize the economy were unfounded.\n\nMr. Benson said that a veteran's lease on Crown lands should be extended to anyone able to farm the land without drainage or irrigation facilities.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6317 file 656-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nCorrespondence School's Enrolment For Studies Up\n\nREGINA.\u2014Number of pupils receiving tuition on grades one to eight from the Saskatchewan government correspondence school has increased by 376 since June and will continue rising as the closing of rural schools in the province, Education Minister W. S. Lloyd said recently.\n\nOf the increase, 291 pupils receive full instruction from the correspondence school under direct direction of a teacher or other qualified person.\n\nFigures were not available on increased high school course enrolments due to the school closing down because such students apply individually for the courses, Mr. Lloyd said.\n\nNew enrolment in the junior grades is approximately 1,000, but this figure has jumped to 2,245 this year, Mr. Lloyd said. The latter figure 784 pupils receive full tuition and 461 study part-time.\n\nCourses follow the curriculum outlined by the department of education. They are written by certified correspondence school staff and pupils write the same departmental examinations used in regular day schools. Mr. Lloyd said. Public school correspondence pupils pay no tuition charge to those qualifying for them.\n\nFour public school teachers at the government correspondence school after work of 784 pupils, almost 200 pupils per teacher.\n\n\"This nearly seven times the number of pupils a teacher would be expected to handle under normal classroom conditions,\" said Mr. Lloyd, stressing however that \"high scholastic standards are maintained.\"\n\nIrrigation, Conservation Said Vital For Land Use\n\nIncreased agricultural production in Saskatchewan is directly related to the problem of rehabilitating soil through conservation and irrigation, Agriculture Minister I. C. Nollet told the legislature.\n\nSpeaking in the budget debate, Mr. Nollet said that of the 60,000,000 cultivated acres in the province only 8,000,000 acres are classed as very good to excellent productive land. Rehabilitation of the remaining 52,000,000 acres, he said, is necessary if the province is to maintain its present production.\n\nPeriod of settlement and subsequent production is gone and the province's farms must be operated on a different basis. Of the 140,000 operating farm units in Saskatchewan in 1939 only 125,000 remain, he said.\n\nThe future of farm production lies with the small farmer who must come to the congress to rehabilitate his farm machinery and land resources.\n\nMr. Nollet referred to suggestions by Jacob Benson (C.C.F.-Last Mountain) that ministers ought to work and meet with the various departments before M.L.A.'s are asked to debate on budget expenditures.\n\nThe minister of Agriculture stressed the need for an increased agricultural production to meet the nation's food needs. Such an increase had been proven possible through the efforts of farmers in the last few years.\n\nCattle production had gone from 1,147,000 pounds in 1939 to a peak of 2,400,000 pounds. Hog production rose from 500,000 in 1939 to 1,754,000 in 1940 and then dropped to 1,300,000, 3,500,000 pounds in 1939 to 20,702,000 pounds in 1940. Wheat prices had been recovered when farmers were hampered by labor shortages, he said.\n\nThe minister also declared plans for the coming year stressed soil conservation and the rehabilitation of forage crop production, Mr. Nollet said, adding that the latter point was particularly important because of low grain prices had reduced forage crop acreage. Because of this Saskatchewan farmers each year had to import 1,000,000 tons of hay.\n\nThe 1947 crop failure had resulted in P.F.A.A. payments of $1,000,000 to 50,000 farmers for damaged crops, Mr. Nollet said.\n\nHe was confident that the provincial agency would have a policy for supplying feed and fodder during this period.\n\nMr. Nollet commended his field staff and the agricultural representative service for their work and said they were largely responsible for locating feed and food areas spared by the drought.\n\nThis season had been the discovery of vast feed reserves which the department did not realise existed.\n\nHigh School Students To Get Courses In General Science\n\nREGINA.\u2014General science courses comprising a number of science subjects will be added to the course of study for Grade 11 and Grade 12 students next fall, beginning with the coming fall term, Henry Jansen, director of the Department of Education, said recently.\n\nThe commencement of these courses in the fall will mean that students will have completed their inclusion in high school curricula in the province. The new course will be offered for Grade 9 students was introduced at the beginning of the 1946-47 school year.\n\nThe new Grade 12 general science course will be optional although it is compulsory in the lower high school grades. Reason for this variation, Mr. Jansen explained, is that the general science course deals with science in general terms, and is not suitable for students who plan to go into science studies at a university following completion of high school.\n\nMr. Jansen emphasized that the general science course for Grade 12 was designed primarily for the use of students who did not plan to continue their studies at a university following high school graduation. Those intending to go on to university studies in science, the regular Grade 12 science course will be taken, and was especially intended for their use, he said.\n\nUnder the regular course, which comprises with similar courses taught elsewhere in Canada, such as chemistry, physics and biology are taught separately, as distinctly individual subjects.\n\nReason for the introduction of the new science courses to the Grade 9 and Grade 10 curricula was because of the emphasis now being placed on science in everyday life, Mr. Jansen explained.\n| Item Description | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| Singer sewing machines | 4 | $58.16 | $232.64 |\n| Sewing tools | 4 | $7.70 | $30.80 |\n\nTotal: $263.44\n\nPlease remit to:\nSinger sewing Machine Company\nCollection Dept.,\n424 Portage Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs.

G. W. Fisher, Principal, has been in ill health for some six weeks, having spent the last three weeks in hospital. The date of his return to duty is uncertain. 56 Boys who sleep in Building No. 30 are taken by truck each morning to St. Alban's School and remain there until 7.00 pm. Nothing further has been done to establish the school at Ex. 122 while Rev. Fisher has been ill. Things were bogging down.\n\nI interviewed Rev. Fisher yesterday, he now agrees that I go ahead with further developments. Work on making the kitchen ready is under way also the laundry, (lighting, heating and refrigeration).\n\nRev. Fisher is not able to concentrate or make decisions. He has an idea the Department has requested him to forward an account for a purchase made in December. No trace of this letter can be found in his office. Was such a request made?\n\nI find a shipment of battleship linoleum was received in March. Rev. Fisher's files indicate the account covering this purchase was forwarded by him to the Department. Is there an outstanding account covering a December shipment of any kind. Accounts have been received from Marshall Wells covering a recent shipment of kitchen and table cutlery etc., this shipment is to be checked today and the accounts will be forwarded forthwith if found in order.\nI am aware, why, this school is referred to as the Lac La Ronge Residential School, but this is frightfully confusing, for instance, mail addressed to Rev. Fisher in this manner quite often goes up to Lac La Ronge and has been known to remain there for two weeks. Please address all mail to Rev. G. W. Fisher, St. Alban's Indian Residential School, Prince Albert, Sask.; in future.\n\nE. S.

However it might be that only a few tubes are needed as, as far as I know, there are only three or four leaking.\n\nWould you write Mr. Fisher regarding repairs on this as he can have it done at the Prince Albert Foundry.\n\nR.S.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nThere are two matters I must write to you about. (1) With regard to the seasonal schools at Stanley and Pelican Narrows. I very much regret to inform you that to date I have not been able to secure teachers for either one of these schools. Young University students who are not studying for theology seem to be able to demand very high wages for their summer's work, and they do not seem to be attracted by what we are able to offer them, especially when they are required to pay their own travelling expenses and added cost of board in the North. But I will continue in my endeavour to secure teachers because I am most anxious that these poor Indians in the North be given at least some education.\n\n(2) The second matter I wish to discuss with you is the replacement of our school at Lac la Ronge. I understand that the sum of $200,000.00 was passed by Parliament for the building of a school in Northern Saskatchewan, at least I read something to this effect in the newspapers. Moreover, various rumors have reached me as to what the Government intends to do regarding rebuilding our schools at Onion Lake and Lac la Ronge. I wonder if I may trouble you to please let me know the mind of the Department in this matter. I know there were different ideas as to the location of the new school to replace the one at Lac la Ronge, but I have no definite word as to the mind of the Department on this question.\n\nSt. Alban's School here is doing an excellent job of work and from my visits to the school I am pleased to see the happy condition of the children. Also it is a matter of great satisfaction to me that the children who are attending the local High School are enjoying their work. If there is anything I can do I shall be most happy to offer my services in any possible way. I think you can understand my desire that our Indian boys and girls of this North country should be adequately provided for along the most important line of education.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have today written him an air mail letter asking that he visit you in Prince Albert with regard to our plans for Lac la Ronge. At the present time we have several proposals before us but no decision has as yet been reached.\n\nWith regard to seasonal schools, while we can not pay travelling expenses of students into these places, we can offer seasonal salaries that are high enough to help defray at least part of the travelling expenses. We could offer $150.00 a month for University students at Stanley and Pelican Narrows.\n\nWe have been getting students to go in to Northern Ontario from the University of Toronto and the University of Eastern Ontario.\n\nI am leaving tonight for an inspection trip in Eastern Ontario but will expect to hear further from you with regard to these schools shortly after my return on May 15.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRt. Rev. H.D.

We have sent him an air mail letter with regard to the proposed visit to Mr. Pearce in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. As soon as we hear from him we will advise you as to the approximate date that he will be in your part of Saskatchewan.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Minister.\n\nThe Honourable W.S.

Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nLac la Ronge Residential School.\n\nWe have received a letter from the Minister of Education for the Province of Saskatchewan which you will find attached hereto. Would you please advise me by return air mail as to the approximate date of your arrival in Regina, so that we can advise Mr. Lloyd accordingly. Your main purpose in this visit will be that of a fact finder. We want to get as much detail as possible about the school which is being erected at Lac la Ronge and also as to the possibility for future expansion. The final decision as to the location of the school will be reached on a fairly high level and, therefore, I would suggest that you absorb as much information as possible without giving out a great deal.\n\nAlso please find an extract from a letter of April 30th from Bishop Martin. I advised him that you would see him. In this case would you write directly to him in Prince Albert so that you can discuss the situation with him.

Woodsworth, Indian Agent,\nHobbema, Alberta.\n\nLac la Ronge Residential School.\n\nYour letter of May 10th arrived when I was away on an inspection trip at Manitoulin Island. However, I had an opportunity of discussing the Lac la Ronge situation and your letter with Dr. Keenleyside, Mr. Jackson and Mr. Hoey this morning.\n\nThe consensus of opinion is that we should be prepared to go ahead with the erection of a hostel at Lac la Ronge. This hostel could be conducted by the Missionary Society of the Church of England and the children would attend the Lac la Ronge Provincial School. As this is, undoubtedly, one of the trends in Indian Education which will be forthcoming from the deliberations of the Parliamentary Committee, it is felt that Lac la Ronge would be a good place in which to introduce such a program. Therefore, you can discuss the situation with Bishop Martin and the Reverend Principal of the present Prince Albert/Lac la Ronge School to find out the number of children for whom we should provide accommodation at Lac la Ronge. This is closely tied up with the future of the Prince Albert situation. A decision must be reached as to whether we will continue to operate a school in the old Theological College or to concentrate our attentions on the Army Camp. From here it is somewhat difficult to make a firm decision but it would seem that a good Residential School in Prince Albert (at the Army Camp) and a hostel at Lac la Ronge would amply care for all the Anglican children in Northern Saskatchewan whom we are unable to reach with our day schools.\nI know that Mr. Ostrander will have some objection to this proposal as he feels that the Educational system in Saskatchewan \"not to be above reproach\". However, I feel certain that the Parliamentary Committee is going to favour more and more, closer co-operation between our Education Division and the various Provincial Departments of Education.\n\nWith regard to the second point raised concerning the opening of new day schools in Northern Saskatchewan, we cannot at the present time enter into any written contract with the Provincial Department of Education. However, when the new Act is finally passed by Parliament, it is anticipated that provision will be made for such agreement and that we will then be able to come to the various Western Provinces with proposals for Education. Therefore, the more thoroughly you can acquaint yourself with conditions in the Northern parts of these Provinces, the better we will be able to approach the situation when the time arises. It will be quite alright for you to remain away from Ottawa until on in June as you propose.\n\nI realize that the above is a rather rambling letter but I hope it will brief you sufficiently to meet the Minister of Education in Regina on or about Tuesday, May 25th. Please find attached a draft letter which I am today sending over to Dr. Keenleyside for forwarding to the Honourable Mr. Lloyd.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/HM.\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nRe: Lac la Ronge Residential School\n\nI have your letter of May 6th with which you intended to enclose a copy of a letter from the Honorable Mr. Lloyd and an extract from a letter from Bishop Martin. Instead, the whole of Bishop Martin's letter is attached and there is nothing of Mr. Lloyd's communication.\n\nFor this week and next, Mr. Gooderham has suggested the following itinerary -\n\nMay 10 - by car with Supt. Pugh to Morley\n\" 11 - Survey of Morley\n\" 12 - Survey of Pekisko where new reserve is planned.\n\" 13 - Further work at Morley\n\" 14 - Survey of Sarcee\n\" 15 - Office work in Calgary\n\" 17 - Proceed to Rocky Mountain House\n\" 18 - Business at Nordegg\nRemainder of week in the Hobbema area\n\nThis would allow me to be in Regina on Tuesday, May 25th. I could visit schools in the vicinity of Regina until such time as the Saskatchewan Department of Education is prepared to conduct discussions. As you say, however, \"discussion\" is hardly the word, as I shall be doing the listening.\n\nIf you can spare me until well on into June, I should be able to reach several points in the northern portions of these provinces which have so far defied anyone's approach. That would cut down the expense of time and fare from Ottawa to the Saskatchewan border. It will mean, of course, voluminous reports.\n\nI have several books of notes but am awaiting photographs to illustrate certain situations.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC. A. F. Clark,\nEducational Survey Officer.\nOttawa, May 19, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Lloyd:\n\nSince receiving your letter of April 16th, we have been able to communicate with our Educational Survey officer who is at present inspecting schools in Alberta. He advises that he should arrive in Regina about May 25th. He has been told to contact your office on arrival.\n\nAt the present time, we are awaiting the decisions of the Parliamentary Committee with regard to the revision of the Indian Act. It is expected that changes will be made in the educational sections. In the meantime, we have asked Major Clark to obtain from you all possible detail with regard to your new school at Lac la Bonge and also your plans for educational advancement in Northern Saskatchewan.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nActing Minister.\n\nThe Honourable W. S. Lloyd,\nMinister of Education,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nBFN/EM\nMay 22, 1948.\n\nMr. E.S. Jone, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, regarding shipments for the school being established in Prince Albert Camp, and which are marked for Lac la Ronge, it is practically impossible for us to decide what shipments have not yet gone forward.\n\nWe feel that you should be able to notify both the express and freight departments of the railway that when any shipments come to Prince Albert marked Lac la Ronge they must be held for delivery to the Prince Albert Camp and not to Lac la Ronge, Sask.\n\nIt is difficult for us to understand why the Saskatchewan Transport Co., would take the shipment without receiving instructions either from you or from Reverend Mr. Fisher.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nDear Mr. Lloyd:\n\nSince receiving your letter of April 19th, we have been able to communicate with our Educational Survey Officer who is at present inspecting schools in Alberta.

All items asked for in requisition dated 29th December, 1947, have now been ordered with the exception of 1 meat chopping block and 3 hair sprayers.\n\nIt will be in order for the Indian Supt. to make the best possible arrangements to procure the outstanding items locally.\n\nW.

Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nLac la Ronge Indian Residential School\nPrince Albert Army Camp\n\nA meeting of officials of the Indian School Administration of the M.S.C.C. and our Education Division was recently held here to discuss the future policy with regard to the Elkhorn Residential School, the Prince Albert Residential School and the Lac la Ronge Residential School (at present being conducted in the Army Camp at Prince Albert).\n\nAfter considerable discussion, it was decided to set the pupilage at the temporary school in the Prince Albert Army Camp at 200.\n\nThe officials of the Indian School Administration seemed to prefer not to place too many children in these temporary quarters until they have had an opportunity of operating it for at least a period of a year.\n\nWe have already provided considerable equipment for this school on the basis of 120 pupils. We are closing the Indian Residential School at Chapleau, Ontario and arrangements are being made to ship all beds, bedding, desks, tables, etc., to the new school in the Prince Albert Camp in order to provide for the extra 80 children.\n\nWe are sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Indian Superintendent Jones at Prince Albert and an accountable advance for $2,000.00. We would like to have the necessary partitions erected, cupboards built and other emergency construction work carried out in\norder to have the school ready for occupancy by September 7. It is felt that the best and fastest way to have this carpentry work carried out is by day labour. It is understood that a certain amount of the lumber required is already on hand. Authority is given for the local purchase of nails and other materials in an amount not to exceed $100.00. If additional materials are required, either submit a requisition by air mail or wire details as to requirements.\n\nWe are ordering the following supplies of interior paint from the Departmental Purchasing Agent today in order to expedite delivery:\n\n- 5 gallons interior enamel, pale green\n- 5 gallons interior enamel, white\n- 10 gallons Kem-tone or similar spreader paint, pale green.\n\nYou can advise by Army Message as to further quantities required.\n\nWith regard to plumbing repairs, would you please advise as to what is required in order to provide adequate facilities for 200 children and staff. Would you also submit tenders from local plumbing firms if possible.\n\nBernard F.

My purpose in writing to you at this time is to ascertain if your firm would co-operate with us to the extent of giving us priority in delivery of the equipment mentioned on the purchase order.\n\nAfter considerable expense and trouble, the Department has made temporary arrangements for the operation of the Indian Residential School in the Army camp at Prince Albert, to replace the Lac la Ronge Residential School that was burned two years ago.\n\nThere is a large number of children in this area requiring education and we wish to have them in school by September 1st. Naturally we will require the laundry machinery by that time in order that the school can properly function. I think you will agree that we are entitled to every possible consideration and I would appreciate it very much to hear from you that the machinery ordered on the above purchase order will be delivered by September 1st.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

The 1/2-bag capacity Machine is definitely too small for our needs, likewise the price of your 1-bag capacity Machine is considerably higher than other quotations received.\n\nUnder the circumstances we feel that the logical course is to cancel our purchase order No. 31476.\n\nI trust that this will not cause you any great inconvenience as you will no doubt have plenty of opportunity to sell it elsewhere. Kindly return the purchase order in the enclosed addressed envelope.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Vincent,\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nEncl.l\nAIR MAIL\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nAttention of Mr. Neary\n\nI am in receipt of Department letter of the 14th instant,\nFile 132-2-5 (E.1), in connection with Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School,\nPrince Albert Army Camp.\n\nThe matters referred to were discussed with Superintendent E.S.\nJones, of the Carlton Agency, and Reverend C.W. Fisher, Principal of St. Alban's\nSchool, Prince Albert, on the 17th instant, and a decision made as to the additional\nbuildings which will be immediately required for a proposed 200-pupil school.\n\nIf you will refer to my letter of June 5th, 1948, File No. 1021-303-\n11 AGE., you will note that I asked that steps be taken to secure certain buildings\nreferred to as Nos. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, and 34. Some of\nthese have already been secured, namely Nos. 23, 27, 29, 33, and 34. Nos. 21 and 31\nare now vacant and they, in addition to those already secured, should be immediately\nsecured for the new school. All those mentioned in my letter of June 5th, File 1021-\n303-11 AGE., will eventually be needed.\n\nAssuming that Nos. 21 and 31 can be turned over to our Department for\nschool use, I instructed Mr. Jones to have a plumber examine the buildings and give\na quotation on preparation of the plumbing and heating for immediate occupancy, which\nhe will do, and submit requisitions to the Department at once.\n\nPlans were also made for removing some partitions and installing\nothers in the different buildings which we propose using. Some consideration was\ngiven to using materials on hand for the erection of the partitions, but we found\nthat no suitable material was on hand for this purpose, therefore Mr. Jones is\npreparing a requisition to be forwarded immediately to the Department for partition\nmaterial and any other materials needed over and above the materials now on hand.\nA requisition in this connection will be submitted by Mr. Jones at once after he\nhas secured local prices. It was too late on Saturday to secure prices when we\nhad finished our plans. As I had no information as to the quantity of beds, bedding,\netc. to be shipped from Chapleau, it was impossible to prepare a requisition for\nthese. That requisition will have to wait until Mr. Fisher secures the information\nfrom the former Principal at the Chapleau School as to the shipment from there.\n\nIt has been my plan to use the main part of Building No. 27, the\ndrill hall, for a recreation building, the lean-to part thereof to be used for the\nlaundry, sewing-room, storage space and for manual training. This lean-to part\nhas its own heating plant and will be very easy to heat. The main part of the\nbuilding is heated by two large circulating heaters which Mr. Fisher has been inform-\ned will use two tons of coal a day to heat the occupiers. This will appear to be\nrather expensive heating for a school with a pupilage of 200. Certainly it is not\ntoo expensive if the school eventually has a population of 400, which, I believe,\nshould be planned on from the beginning, notwithstanding the doubt of the Church\nofficials in that regard. Some work is needed on the lean-to of Building No. 27,\nand Mr. Jones will prepare a requisition in that connection. Very little work is\nneeded to prepare the main part of the building.\n\nThe interiors of all of the buildings which we will use require paint\nand I am sure that the quantity of paint referred to in your letter will not be\nsufficient, therefore another requisition will be submitted for the paint. The\nfloor of that part of Building No. 3 which will be used for the dining-room certainly needs improvement. It is badly chewed with Army boots and it is useless to paint it in its present condition. Surfacing with veneer and battleship linolium is recommended for this floor, and a requisition will be submitted by Mr. Jones in connection therewith.\n\nPreparations are being made to place six classrooms all in Building No. 23. Partitions, plumbing, redecoration and blackboards are required for these classrooms.\n\nIt is proposed to use Buildings Nos. 29, 30, and 31 (when secured) for children's dormitories, playrooms, and cloakrooms. Approximately 65 pupils will sleep in each of these buildings, and each building will have a playroom and accommodation for two staff members. Mr. Fisher's request for playroom space in each of these buildings resulted from his fear that the main part of the drill hall will be too expensive to heat during all of the cold weather.\n\nBuilding No. 21 is to be prepared for staff quarters by partitions and re-arrangement of plumbing, heating, etc., and redecoration.\n\nBuilding No. 3, the centre part of which is the kitchen, refrigerator, etc., and an \"H\" hut, one side of which will be the dining-room, is to be prepared on the one side for a suite for the Principal, and a Chapel. The whole of this building needs redecoration in addition to the improvement of the floor, as previously referred to, for that part which is to be used for the dining-room.\n\nI may say with regard to the whole, the cost of preparing these buildings will far exceed $2,000.00, and I would appreciate being advised of the total amount available in the event that it is all needed.\n\nJ.P.B Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is noted that you have already secured buildings 23, 27, 29, 33 and 34.\n\nWe are writing the Public Works Department again today requesting that they immediately allot us buildings 21 and 31 which you state are now vacant and also requesting them to allot buildings 19, 20, 22, 30 and 32 at the earliest possible date.\n\nWe have received the requisition from Superintendent Jones for the material required for the partitions and we are submitting this to the Purchasing Branch requesting them to give the matter immediate attention. The other requisitions to which you refer will be placed before the Purchasing Agent as soon as they are received.\n\nAs a matter of information, we would like to know what disposal has been made of the material purchased from the Saskatchewan Reconstruction Corporation at a cost of slightly over $4,000.00.\n\nWe have allotted an amount of $10,000.00\nfor labour and materials required to make these buildings habitable but we hope that it will not be found necessary to expend the amount mentioned. In view of the contents of your letter, we are forwarding an additional $2,000.00 for labour to Indian Superintendent Jones, so that the work will not be delayed.\n\nBernard F.

Jones, of the Carlton Agency, to have it moved into Building No. 27 (the drill hall), as Building No. 29 is one of the buildings to be prepared for a children's dormitory. Some of the material can be used for the required work of preparing the buildings for occupation by the school, and a record will be kept of this. However, none of it is useful for the wall surfaces of the partitions, which was the reason for asking for wallboard or some such material for the wall surfaces.\n\nWith regard to the sixth paragraph of the Department letter referred to, please inform me of the total amount allotted. The figure is given in the letter but the office receiving stamp was inadvertently placed over the figure in such a way that it cannot be distinguished.\n\nJ.P.B.

It is noted that some of the material will be used in making necessary repairs to the other buildings.\n\nThe total amount allotted for labour and materials required to make the building habitable is $10,000.00.\n\nBernard E.

Kitchener Bird was found guilty and sentenced to an undetermined term in the Regina Industrial School. He was only a short time at the school when he was sent to the Sanatorium with T.B.\n\nThere has been much delay in proceeding with the charge against John Roberts, but eventually the case is completed, and I am informed in report from Superintendent T.W. Chard, in Charge, C.I.B., R.C.M. Police, Regina, that John Roberts appeared before Police Magistrate J.E. Lussier, of Lac la Ronge, on July 19th, 1948, and the charge against him was dismissed.\n\nJ.F.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nAugust 4.\n\nDear Mr. Philan,\n\nI have just one significant picture of Holy Angels School so far, as the post office people \"mislaid\" the other roll where I really got the low-down and the close-up. The school\u2014finished in tile but mostly plywood inside\u2014appears at the left. Between the church and the domed-roof building at the right (new mission) is the old mission which they are going to demolish. There is much more to be said re this school.\n\nLocally, the Chaplain freight is being stored in the gymnasium. Some of it is good; other items are a bit seedy. Work on the classroom block is going ahead. They will be good rooms, but we must see that nobody whose ideas are clouded with long habituation to magic blackboards and over-many desks to a room sets the standard. I have asked Mr. Supt. Jones to ensure that a window here and there is crossed over in the Colonel Randle manner.\n\nI made a cheap evening station to station call to Mr. Ostrander. He is staying in Regina until Monday noon when he is leaving.\nfor sure and Battleford. His assistant is already in Battleford where he must remain for a while because of staff shortages. His clerk Scott is here with the exhibition stuff. The Indian Brotherhood has held a three-day session in the barracks.\n\nI'll work my way south and confer with Mr. Ostrander on Monday before proceeding to Elkhorn.\n\nAu revoir \u2014 soon!\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nCharles Fordyce Clark\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your communication of July 26th (132-2-(E-1)), you are informed that the District Resident Architect has been instructed to turn over immediately buildings 23, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34, No. 122 Basic Training Centre, Prince Albert, Sask. to the Department of Mines and Resources for use as an Indian Residential School.\n\nBuildings 19, 20, 21 and 22 will be turned over to the Department of Mines and Resources when they are vacated by the Provincial Government of Saskatchewan.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGustave Brault,\nChief Architect.\n\nGO:RH\n\nIndian Affairs.

See purchase order 31447.\n\nWe have not yet received a reply to our letter and consequently I am enclosing herewith a copy of same in order that it may receive your prompt attention.\n\nWe trust that you will advise us that this equipment will be delivered to the school by September 1st.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMGD\nColonel Neary:\n\nPrince Albert Indian Residential School\n\nThe accompanying memoranda and diagrams may help you to appreciate the efforts of our colleagues here. Mr. Jones and I spent considerable time this past week on the spot with the Rev. Mr. Fisher. This morning Mr. Ostrander and I had a long conference with Mr. Fisher here.\n\nAfter the Elkhorn meeting Mr. Fisher is taking a few days' holiday and will be in Prince Albert on the 22nd or earlier. He is going to be in Lac La Ronge on the 29th recruiting pupils.\n\nStaff for the barracks school is not yet complete, but the physical plant is likely to be usable by the day appointed for the opening of Indian schools.\n\nC.A.T. Clark\nAugust 8, 1948\n\nMr. Ostrander:\n\nPrince Albert Indian Residential School:\n\nI know you are as anxious as I am that the citizens of Prince Albert shall have no reason to say that our Department is setting up in their city a second-rate institution for \"second-class citizens.\" I have spent several days in a survey of potentialities, of the progress being made, and in acquainting myself with the ideals toward which Mr. Asst. Jones and Rev. Mr. Fisher are working.\n\nIt seems to me that where the expenditure required is reasonable we should not ask the staff or pupils to put up with any make-do or haphazard substitute for what is fitting and proper to the inculcation or maintenance of self-esteem. I may seem to labour this point, but I have seen too many schools where other considerations are allowed to outweigh basic physical needs, resulting in undesirable emotional reactions and in mental (and probably spiritual!) attitudes that hamstring those who are trying to pull their weight.\n\n1. The classrooms appear to be commodious, but we must check any tendency to crowd in more than forty pupils to a teacher. Natural light is likely to be good, but I'm not certain that sufficient windows can be kept open. Temperature may also become a problem. Thermometers should be placed in each room and temperatures regularly recorded.\n\nP.T.O.\nClassrooms (cont.)\n\nAs there are not enough desks, one room for small primary grade children might well be equipped with the small tables and chairs that are popular in up-to-date schools.\n\nBlackboards are provided in our new one-room forty-pupil schools to the extent of 48 feet. The amount of blackboard in St. Allan's is pitifully small and should not be permitted to be a standard of comparison.\n\nThe lavatories in the classroom block ought to be completely adjusted before classes begin. The urinal in the room appointed for girls should be removed and four washbasins installed with a mirror above each. In the boys' room the urinal should be screened off and two wash basins installed.\n\nSoap is going to be more expensive. Liquid soap dispensers would be more economical and hygienic.\n\nEach toilet compartment to be equipped on the right-hand side with a toilet-tissue fixture. This may evoke protests. I have heard them all in both languages. Some of our schools make a success of this training; others don't seem to be even trying.\n\nDormitories:\n\nWith ten-foot ceilings, the Department normally permits one single bed to each fifty square feet of floor space (500 cu ft). The army scaled it down to 400 cu ft per adult.\n\nThe only room which I saw under construction intended as a dormitory supervisor's bedroom was on the small side and was planned without regard for a clothes closet. Both the room and the closet should be bigger unless only small-seated supervisors are to be retained.\n\nA private bath-room for the supervisors in each dormitory is essential if worthwhile personnel are going to remain in the service. Certain surplus units can be re-medicated to give a decent-sized room with lights, mirror, wash-basin, toilet-seat, bath-tub, radiator, and an electricity outlet for curling-iron, razor, etc. Let us reduce the excuses for frivolousness.\nDining Room: We should not permit partitions separating boys from girls. Flooring? The staff dining room should be partitioned off at one end and will thus have an exit for teachers, etc., only and a door into the pupils' mess-hall.\n\nKitchen: The established kitchen to be used as such.\n\nDish washing room: There was an idea put forward that a bake-oven should be installed here. The set-up is needed for washing and storing dishes. Just because people get in each other's way in the St. Allan's kitchen when various activities are going on simultaneously, there is no reason why inconvenience should be imported into the new set-up. Besides, where would the flour be stored?\n\nBaking: A good baking and storage room for bread and flour could be set up in the gym lean-to.\n\nLaundry: This should be set up in the gymnasium lean-to, and could serve both present schools. A suggested layout is given in the attached diagram for pooling certain activities of the two city establishments which are only fifteen minutes' slow walking apart.\n\nBaking,\nLaundry,\nSewing,\nIndustrial Arts.\n\nPTO.\nGarage and implement storage need to be arranged.\n\nChapel: As planned in the Miss Hall building.\n\nPrincipal's residence, office, etc., in Bldg. #32.\n\nHut #15 (partly burned) may be \"cannibalized\" for all usable equipment & materials.\n\nMarried Staff Quarters: Bldg. #21\n\nInfirmary, boys, 4 bed: Bldg. 21\n\nInfirmary, girls, 4 bed: Bldg. 21\n\nIsolation ward: Bldg. 21\n\nLibrary (silent room): Bldg. 21\n\nThis differs from the conception of a reading, conversation and parlour games room, or the \"play\" rooms in dormitory buildings.\n\nStaff Lounge & Social Room; is there space in 21? Or should we acquire more space so as to be able to accommodate visitors? Some provision for Indian parents might be in order.\n\nAs our Principal has to administer the two schools I assume he will not want to duplicate activities unnecessarily. He might, therefore, wish to consolidate:\n\nReligious observances,\nLaundry,\nSewing,\nIndustrial arts,\nBaking and Canning,\nAgriculture in all its forms\nOutdoor sports. (Certain play apparatus at the barracks should be moved)\nFood storage, (pantries)\nVegetable storage\nTransport of pupils from and to homes\nPurchasing.\n\nLater I may have some suggestions on the organization of the pupils for classroom work.\n\nC.A.F.

(RG 10, Volume 6317 file 656-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am in receipt of Department letter of the 13th instant, File 115-1-9 (Enl.), in connection with the Lac la Ronge School (Prince Albert), and the report of Mr. G.A.F. Clark on his visit there recently. I am quite in agreement with the proposal to clear and break as much as possible of the areas numbered 1, 2, and 3, on Mr. Clark's rough plan, which is returned herewith. I am instructing Superintendent E.S. Jones to proceed with an expenditure up to $350.00 to clear and break this land, if possible, this year. I notice the acreages shown by Mr. Clark, approximately 6 acres in Plot No. 1; 2 acres in Plot No. 2; and 3 acres in Plot No. 3. I believe the acreage shown is about correct for Plots Nos. 2 and 3, but I went over the other area referred to as Plot No. 1, and I am reasonably certain that it is considerably less than 6 acres. The whole of the area might contain close to 6 acres, but a considerable part of it is useless clay subsoil, which has been removed from the area shown as the play area, and it is unsuitable for growing any garden produce. I believe the total area, which can be usefully broken and cultivated in Plot No. 1 is about 3\u00bd to 4 acres. However, we need as much of it as we can get, and will break up all that is useful.\n\nI am endeavouring to ascertain the possibility of acquiring the land shown in Mr. Clark's plan as \"available on lease from city\", which I believe contains about 40 acres. Mr. Jones was instructed to interview the officials concerned, and advise me as soon as possible, as to the possibility of acquiring this on lease. There is, in addition to this, an area of approximately 18 acres immediately to the south of the area shown in Mr. Clark's plan as \"orchard, garden, poultry, stable\". This can be purchased, I understand, for $2500.00.\n\nI instructed Mr. Jones to ascertain the possibility of buying this land, and if it can be bought for $2500.00 I would recommend that we buy. I do not think it can be leased.\n\nWith regard to the poultry house and the keeping of hens, no poultry has been kept at this school, but Reverend Mr. Fisher wishes to keep a flock of chickens, and intends to buy 200 chicks next spring if he has suitable facilities in which to keep them. The building referred to as a poultry house, and the yard immediately adjacent thereto, can be made suitable for keeping chickens, but the expenditure in this connection might well be delayed until next spring.\n\nWork is progressing favourably, by day labour, in preparing the necessary buildings for the school, is being done very economically, and will prove quite satisfactory to all concerned.\n\nJ.P.B.

The necessary authority has been given and the purchasing agent has been requested to order the paint.\n\nIt is difficult for us to understand why Superintendent Jones has delayed sending this order until this date. We sent some paint so that the work could proceed, about the middle of July and in our letter of July 14th we pointed out that further quantities would be supplied on receipt of an Army message. In your letter of July 19th you stated that another requisition would be forwarded for paint. No requisition has reached us until Superintendent Jones' telegram of today.\n\nBernard F.

The laundry equipment has not yet arrived at the school.\n\nI believe that the title \"Lac la Ronge School\", should be changed. I make this comment while quite aware of the fact that it is the wish of the Church Authorities to continue with the name, and also, I presume, continuance of the name has something to do with the current year's appropriation for the Lac la Ronge School.\n\nSuperintendent E.S. Jones has communicated with the Department on more than one occasion, I believe, in connection with shipments going astray when consigned to the Lac la Ronge School. Some of them have actually been hauled by truck from Prince Albert to Lac la Ronge, and back to Prince Albert, a distance of about 330 miles of road. Is there any reason why this school cannot be called the Prince Albert Indian Residential School to distinguish it from the St. Alban's Indian Residential School at Prince Albert? It is my hope that eventually the two schools will be amalgamated under one of these names.\n\nJ.F.B.

Ostrander, Regional Supervisor of Indian Agencies, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe have your letter of the 26th ultimo suggesting that the title \"Lac la Ronge School\" be changed.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation the funds for payment of the per capita grant and other expenses are provided under the name just mentioned.\n\nWe are not prepared to make any change in the name at the present time but will give the matter further consideration when preparing our appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, it should not be difficult for Superintendent Jones to confer with the Railway officials at Prince Albert and also with the trucking companies so that no shipments intended for the present Lac la Ronge School go forward to the site of the former school.\n\nBernard F.

My intentions are to have the classrooms and dormitories painted immediately. The recreation room and staff quarters can be decorated when school is in progress.\n\nDue to the fact that I have to spend so much of my time away from the office, I have been unable to carry out Departmental instructions regarding obtaining authority before making purchases of materials. Full use has been made of all available material, however, it has been necessary to purchase a number of doors and casings for the classrooms and staff quarters, and such finishing materials as quarter-round and door facings. It has been necessary to have wiring changed and switches installed in the classrooms.\n\nI realize the instructions re: purchases were clear and definite, but due to the shortage of time and available help, I considered it would not be advisable to hold up the work.\n\nI trust my actions will be approved.\n\nAUG 31 1948\n\nE.S.

Two hundred children are\nin residence. It is understood the staff will be complete\nand that classes will commence on Monday September 13th.\n\nThe clearing and breaking of the garden area,\nauthorized, has been completed and is in first class shape.\n\nRe: the $4000.00 advance received, expenditures to\ndate are as follows:\n\nWages; carpenters, plumbers & Helpers; total hours worked up\nTo week ending September 4th. 1390\u00bd hours; Total Cost $1440.88\n\nMikes Transfer; for moving 66,000 ft.

It is my intention to size and calomine the ceiling in all classrooms. I consider the walls can be painted at a later date. Staff quarters have to be decorated, several members of the staff have stated they will decorate their own quarters if materials are supplied. I intend to take advantage of this.\n\nWork yet to be done:\n- Principal's living quarters and office.\n- Living quarters for two married staff members half completed.\n- Laundry equipment space to be cleared and equipment set up.\n- Garage to house one car and one truck, Estimated cost of Labour and Materials $1600.00\n\nAdditional kitchen utensils and table ware are required also additional beds, mattresses and bedding; also floor covering to serve the present enrollment. Rev. Fisher is preparing a requisition covering the above.\n\nConsideration must be given immediately to accommodate an additional 100 pupils. These can be housed and fed in buildings already prepared, additional classroom space will be required.\n\nI regret the fact that the Department has not been kept informed regarding the progress of the work undertaken.\n\nE.

(RG 10, Volume 6317 file 656-5, part 8)\nA SOURCE of NEVER-ENDING SATISFACTION\n\nBehind the component parts of the GILSON \"WEATHER-MAKER\" lies an interesting story of years of patient experiment and test\u2014the application of scientific engineering skill in designing\u2014and the same traditionally high standard of workmanship and attention to detail so characteristic of all GILSON products. Note these excellent features...\n\nWhat it is:\u2014\n\nThe sectional illustrations below show how the Gibson \"Weather-Maker\" is constructed. First a heating unit of very heavy copper-bearing steel plate, sealed by electric arc welding into a single, solid, dust-proof unit. Hot gases pass through a specially designed radiator which extracts every possible unit of heat before these gases enter the flue. Underneath the radiator are the air filters for removing dust and dirt from drawn air, and below these again is housed the silent, slow-moving fan. The automatic humidifier, with porous evaporating plates, located above the heating unit, feeds to the thirsty air the moisture it lacks, thus keeping the atmosphere always properly humidified.\n\nWhat it does:\u2014\n\nCombustion, of course, takes place in the heating unit\u2014which may be hand-fired with any fuel, or by means of a stoker, oil burner, coal blower or gas burner. When the air surrounding the unit becomes heated to a pre-determined temperature the fan starts automatically. This draws the air down through the filters, forcing it against the heated surfaces and over the automatic humidifier, whence it is sent back into every nook and corner of the house\u2014a continual gentle flow of healthful warmed (not hot) air containing the right degree of moisture and free from dust. This clean, humidified, circulating air is yours to enjoy at will\u2014automatic and controlled to suit your needs.\n\nHeating Unit\n\nTwo decades of experience in building welded steel furnaces (longer than any other Canadian factory) are behind this massively constructed heating unit, which is made to burn any kind of fuel. Copper-bearing steel as heavy as eight gauge\u2014is used. The firepot is built in removable sections, of sturdy cast iron. Being straight\u2014with grate diameter equal to maximum firepot diameter\u2014ideal combustion is achieved, with no sloping sides to accumulate ash or retard heat radiation. The fire door is large. The entire heating unit is built to salvage the most heat from the fuel consumed and to last indefinitely.\n\nAutomatic HEAT CONTROL\n\nFor hand-fired installations the operation of the fan is controlled by a Faunsditch, which stops the air whenever the fan is not actually needed. The fan stops automatically when the air temperature exceeds the desired minimum. It is designed to use mechanical firing equipment such as stoker, oil burner, etc.\n\nThe Humidifier\n\nThis is located above the heating unit \u2014 where the air is warmest and thus able to absorb the most moisture. The porous ceramic plates raise the water like a wick, whence it is readily absorbed by the air. The water level in the pan is automatically maintained by the float valve.\n\nLong-life Radiator\n\nBefore the hot gases from combustion can enter the chimney they must pass through this oval-shaped radiator\u2014cleverly designed to present a large surface area to the incoming gases, contacting the radiator both through the centre and outside and thus abstracting heat from the gases and preventing it from being wasted up the chimney. Sealed by electric welding this radiator cannot leak, and its design ensures unusual economy and long life.\n\nCleanable Filters\n\nThere are two filters\u2014easily removed for cleaning. The filter medium is rust-proofed metal wool, sufficiently open for air to pass through while retaining dirt, dust, lint, etc. Filters should be cleaned about every three months in residential installations.\n\nIndian Affairs.

One of our medical officers from the Prince Albert Health Unit should take advantage of the trip to visit the Indians at that point.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. E.

Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nA contract was entered into with Struther's Construction to clear and bring under cultivation 3\u00bd acres of land at a cost of $175.00 per acre. Mr. Ostrander's letter No. 1670-313-11 dated August 25th, 1948.\n\nIt will be noted this firm cleared and brought under cultivation seven acres not 3\u00bd as authorized.\n\nThe area was gone over by Mr. Struther's and myself subsequent to commencement of clearing, and I did not estimate there were seven acres in the plot or that the whole plot could be cleared.\n\nThe work was carried out during my absence, and I accept part of the responsibility. However, the error has this redeeming feature, the plot will provide sufficient garden acreage for the school for all times and the expenditure would have to be made sooner or later.\n\nE. S.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\n\nEncl.\nRegina, October 23rd, 1948.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am in receipt of Department letter of the 21st instant, File 656-5 (E.l), in connection with the clearing of land for the Lac la Ronge School at Prince Albert.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that when it was decided to ask for authority to clear the land for the garden, it was thought that only 3\u00bd acres could be cleared and broken. Consequently, authority was asked on the basis of 3\u00bd acres at a cost of $175.00 an acre. Mr. Jones instructed the Hugh Struther's Construction Company to clear, break, and prepare for garden all the land in the block. In his absence they cleared and broke the whole of it before they took any measurements. When they measured it they found that it was 7 acres instead of 3\u00bd, and have naturally asked for payment for the whole 7 acres at $175.00 an acre.\n\nThis was discussed with Mr. Jones on my last visit to Prince Albert, and I examined the work which had been done. There is no doubt that the area is 7 acres, and it provides an excellent garden plot for use of the school, therefore I would strongly recommend that Carlton Agency Voucher No. 1106 for $1,225.00, be paid as the products from the garden in future years should well justify the expenditure.\n\nJ.P.B.

A tidal wave of pupils came into an inadequately prepared, equipped and staffed institution, compelling various make-shifts and improvisations that must not be permitted to continue any longer than it takes to correct them, having regard, of course, to the money available.\n\nThe increasing incidence of mumps is an added strain and indicates the necessity of setting up one wing of Bldg. 21 as a thoroughly adaptable infirmary. A suggested plan for this is being finalized.\n\nThe dormitory situation was examined by day and by night and attention drawn to matters which must be righted.\n\nAir-space per pupil; ventilation; necessary heating and lighting and use. \"Lock THEM OUT DURING THE DAY.\"\n\nShortage of beds and mattresses.\n\nElkhorn can supply 45 single beds only. Will you please advise re mattresses? 50?\n\nBldgs. 27, 30, 31 will suffice, if used solely as dormitories, for the authorized pupils, plus supervisors, plus necessary storage space.\n\nMarried staff quarters and the principal's residence, Bldg. 32, are not ready for occupancy, but the carpenter is expected to return tomorrow. The furnace may be ready to operate tomorrow. Mr. Waterhouse will then proceed to adjusting the plumbing to serve the infirmary\u2014the pipes separate.\nand amenities for the staff, separated from the pupils. The \"scale of issue\" to pupils of towels, basins, etc., in the infirmary has to be reduced, but the movement of sick pupils to washrooms can be distributed over longer periods than possible in dormitories. A stove is to be added in this building so that food may be brought in bulk from the main kitchen. There seem to be plenty of stoves in the camp.\n\nIncidentally I have consulted against uncaring the new stores (range) designated for the La Ronde school. They are stored in Mr. Sept. Jones' warehouse.\n\nSimilarly I have requested that the huge bake oven recently received be not uncared until we have had a chance to study the economics of bread making here, and have made a well-considered choice of a site\u2014any. This oven is too ponderous a thing with which to guess wrong.\n\nThe drill hall and its lean-to's have been my biggest disappointment. If you will refer to my diagram submitted long before work commenced you will appreciate my surprise on seeing:\n\n1. A young mountain of coal on the main floor of the gym. This, along with some neatly stacked lumber and a conglomeration of useful and useless things and materials effectively shuts off use by the children and makes it necessary to provide covered play space elsewhere\u2014but not in the dormitories!\n\n2. One cartload of coal was dropped in the door of the \"coal\" lean-to which is thus crippled. A lot of stuff is supposed to come out.\nof there\u2014masonry materials, etc., said to be wanted by the C.V.T.S.\n\n3. A garage with an imposing wide door where the laundry was indicated.\n\n4. The laundry sited and outlets cut in the concrete so far over that the toilets intended for the girls were obliterated. There is only one toilet, basin and shower left and these are part of a self-contained apartment (\"stage dressing rooms\") which has been assigned to Mr. Waterhouse, the engineer, on whom we depend for the plumbing and mechanical work. It is a valuable man.\n\n5. Mrs. W's workshop occupies the space where the bake-oven might have been.\n\n6. The principal has an office-cum-bedroom in one of the rooms intended for sewing and repairing\u2014actually the one called \"storage.\" This, of course, is only temporary. The \"sewing\" room is operating, but the distance from it to where the laundry will likely be now may require a complete change in the set-up of vocational instruction for girls. These linoleum covered floors, the good heating and lighting, must not be abused. So far I have heard no mention of library, reading or hobby rooms. These might be thus exploited.\n\nAn alternative for the \"laundry\" has to be found and the answer seems to be that it should go in the kitchen building (33) to which we hope to get title\u2014perhaps we already have been granted this. The Kitchen buildings are #33 and #34.\nThe factors in favour of installing the laundry in the second kitchen are:\n\n1. Concrete floor space 40 ft by 22' 11\" former site reduced to 22' 8\" by 26' 6\"\n2. Four-flue opposed chimney convenient. Chimney would have to be built at gym.\n3. Water tank (L = 10' D = 3' 6\") already set up in Kitchen. Too big to move through eddy. The smaller tank has been removed.\n4. Ceiling is higher in the kitchen.\n5. Clear hanging space; drill hall dirty.\n\nOnly a washer and a drier have come from the factory. N.B. The washer has one broken part; must be welded or replaced.\n\nI advise that the new machinery be set up and the steam and water lines laid on so that the machines from St. Albans can be brought in later and added in an efficient assembly line so that all the machine laundering can be done at the barracks. This would involve no interruption of the laundry processes and should when completed supply a dependable plant capable of operating at varying degrees of full potential according to need.\n\nSt. Albans should soon abandon machine laundering as their lay-out is cramped and inconvenient; they will not have upper-grade girls to work; and the withdrawal of machinery will permit advantageous staff adjustments.\n\nThe belt-driven Chapleau machinery would entail too much expense or hazard to install here.\nDishes and dishwashing are at present a \ndriving business. Washing is being done in \nlittle dish pans on the dining table. A high \npriority job is to connect the hot water pipes to \nthe triple basin sink and handle the \ndishes and cutlery (when the supply becomes adequate) \nin the manner prescribed for institutions. \nThe matron (Mrs. Wood) and the chef de cuisine \nMiss Sheppard know what is required. Moose \nFort school has the equipment (trays, racks, etc.) \nPerhaps more is available from War Assets.\n\nThe same ladies are considering a plan to \nuse cafeteria service. In any case more kitchen \nequipment is necessary to remove the Rube \nGoldberg cartoon features. Needed are:\n1. Work tables of suitable height and top surface \n   - there may be some local stuff which we \n     can convert. We shall try.\n2. Large cooking kettle with drain cock.\n   Five gallons of water and vegetable weigh 50 lb.\n3. Mobile wagons of stone height 2'10\" to \n   transport loaded pots.\n4. The usual kitchen tools - their carrying set \n   is a menace.\n5. Vegetable peeler\n6. Bread slicer - but I don't want to \n   encourage the use of bread.\n7. Other articles endorsed by inspectors.\n\nThe local school superintendent (Mr. Percy) \ntold me that the children were being badly fed. \nI was able to assure him that unhesitating inspection \nof meals at all times has satisfied me that the \nchildren get plenty of good food.\nPlayroom and assembly space are fast-approaching necessities. We shall try to supply these in the court-house buildings (33 + 34) \u2014 a wing of 33 for boys, of 34 for girls.\n\nThe chapel space used in Bldg. 30 must be restored to serve as part of a dormitory to meet air-space requirements. I have suggested using the other wing of 33 as a chapel, but the question of how to heat it (and the \"play-assembly-rumpus\" rooms) arises. Formerly, like the dining-room, they were heated (maybe not) by two small stoves with long hot chimneys of tin pipe \u2014 an unsuitable installation where horseplay is inevitable. (The supervisors will have to be alert to prevent the children from swinging from the pipes of the hot-water heating system in the dormitories. Another damaging activity is the pulling of wire from bed-springs to make catapults. Many other schools where children kill time in dormitories are similarly afflicted. Vigorous physical activities must be supplied and the dormitories used only at such times and temperatures that will induce no dawdling in getting into bed or getting up.)\n\nAccordingly, damage-proof play space, adequately warmed when only necessary so, like the chapel, a priority. Hot air heating by readily controllable apparatus is indicated. Heating apparatus situated in the kitchens out of harm's way and forcing hot air into the wings by one guarded vent would be ideal. Can our heating engineer suggest an installation that comes ready-made, needing only an extension which any tinsmith...\ncan supply? For his office at Ft. Chipewyan,\nthe agent gets complete satisfaction from a\ncompact \"Duotherm\" oil heater. It would\nbe economy to spend as much as $500\napiece for two such units. If this\nexperiment in education fails, such\nheaters would be acceptable at many\nother points where coal is costly.\n\nEach wing has an air-space volume\nof about 25,000 cubic feet, reducible in the\ncase of the chapel by partitioning to\nhalf that figure. The chapel, with the\nchancel sealed off would serve as a visual\neducation centre and concert hall.\n\nThere are no music-making\nmachines for the staff and pupils. I\npropose the purchase of: or acquisition somehow of:\nan inexpensive chapel organ\na record player (radio) for the primary\nclass. The teacher has the special words\na few small radios - these cost very\nlittle when obtained by the Department.\na piano to shuttle between the dining-\nroom and the girls' assembly room\na small piano or harmonium for the\nsix-room academy.\n\nSomething might be done with those\nmuseum piece pianos at the Mohawk\nInstitute where also there are some surplus\nbeds and furniture that simply congest\nthe attic which I have suggested should\nbe sleeping quarters. But there is no\nuse sending freight to join the Chipewyan\nplies in the drill hall. Some of this\nstaff is useless and other things, though\nare a menace to the existence of anything good because anything animate or inanimate which shows any weakness gets picked at and done to death in short order by these people and the habit of destroying is progressively strengthened. I have had to improve their baseballs from which, for the lack of a few stitches in time, the covers had fallen off and the string was unravelling. When compelled to, they retrieved the covers from their vast playing field.\n\nSome of this sort of thing could be prevented or overcome by a more adequate staff in numbers and quality \u2014 and the Principal is likely to make some suggestions. For the present I am concentrating on those inadequacies of plant and equipment which it would seem to be the policy and duty of our Department to set right. The sooner we do it, the sooner we shall be in a position to request the removal of ineffectuals if it is demonstrable that there are any. A day-school installation of comparable size scattered over a few northern reserves would have involved an initial outlay of $100,000 with no guarantee that it would exert anything like equal conditioning influence on as many children. The fraction of the sum quoted which we undertook to spend has not yet been fully expended and I have requested that the pace be accelerated while acknowledging the commendable economy that has been practised. The utmost economy, however, may not suffice to cope with the desiderata I have recorded above.\n\nCopy to Regional Supervisor\n\nC.W.T. Clark\nAddenda:\n\nIn order to eliminate slow, time-consuming chores like hand-scrubbing of floors, moving chairs and benches back and forth there are numerous questions to which the best answers are being sought:\n\nFlooring: On what floors to use the available linoleum.\n\nSeating: Are there any closed churches which have surplus pews?

The purchase order number has been recorded on the voucher in connection with purchases made from the Prince Albert Lumber Co.\n\nAuthority was not obtained in connection with the account submitted by the P.A.

I am aware authority should have been obtained before materials were purchased, but it has been impossible for me to attend to my work in the field and prepare requisitions for purchases of materials in advance in connection with alterations of school buildings.\n\nThe result has been, the work has been carried out economically, and all phases have passed Provincial and City regulations; but to avoid laying off men, I have made purchases without first obtaining authority. These accounts are now being prepared and will be in the hands of the Department in the near future.\n\nThe above action was unavoidable; had I had field men to relieve me of at least some of the travel to distant Reserves, Department instructions could have been complied with.\n\nP.T.O.\nWhen all accounts have been received I will furnish a detailed report, covering what has been done, and what in my opinion, remains to be done.\n\nIn the mean time a chimney is under construction in the laundry, and the electricians are completing wiring of the Principal's quarters.\n\nE.S.

I am hoping that this letter will go forward in the same mail. Normally there is no mail out of here on Saturdays.\n\nMr. Supt. Jones is out of town today and I did not wish to delay attention to this matter. It is, of course, only one factor in retarding the setting-up of laundry equipment here. Other factors are:\n\nIllness of the engineer, Mr. Waterhouse; The Gordon's boiler is still at local foundry; The boiler inspector has to certify the boilers; I have not finalized a diagram for the installation which will permit the addition of other units as they become available. The dimensions of the space available are not those on which we were counting. The Chapleau machinery requires overhead shafting which cannot be arranged here. With some re-conditioning and thoughtful installation it would be usable elsewhere.\n\nThe plan here is to combine the new units with those from St. Albans' which, though individually good, are collectively the cause of too long a working day and detract from school efficiency.\n\nC.A.F.

Stanley Brock Ltd.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nOn the washer (No. M 7364) recently received from you by Lac La Ronge Indian Residential School there is one broken part. It is the member of the frame at the righthand side which supports the pulley shaft and which is bolted (by two bolts) to the larger part of the frame beneath. The break runs diagonally through the bolt hole, exposing one of the bolts, and showing the absence of a triangular piece of metal as illustrated. As the pulley-supporting member is thus actually secured by only one bolt, the washer is not being installed.\n\nYour advice in this matter will be welcomed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.A.F.

In many other cases undesirable make shifts have been made. Because of the shortage of dishes the children in many cases have to eat out of bread-baking pans.\n\nMay I suggest that the copy of this inventory be sent over to the dietitian of the Department of National Health and Welfare so that they may return a list of items which should be added to augment the existing supply of items which are short and to insert items which are not included in the inventory at all.\n\nI should add that several of the large cooking pots (and 10 gal.) are enamel ware. These are, in most cases second hand and when used for vegetables, porridge or other solid foods, too frequently allow their contents to burn. Large-sized double boilers appear to be indicated.\n\nA copy of this inventory is being left with the school and another copy with Mr. Jones, Superintendent.\n\nOn a previous report I recommended the purchase of; a Vegetable peeler, a meat grinder, a carving set and possibly a bread-slicing machine.\n\nEnd of Message,\n\nC. H. F. Clark\nEducational Survey Officer.\n\nThe list of items which are said to be necessary is included in duplicate.

Mr. Fisher:\n\nSkating Rink: Mr. Supt. Jones has measured off an area 150 ft by 80 ft. and has ordered the materials for the siding. It is expected that the boys under supervision will dig the post-holes and make themselves useful in other ways. It should be possible to develop several hockey teams and to invite outside competition as well.\n\nAssembly rooms and Chapel:\n\nAs the cold weather has now set in these rooms should be cleared out and cleaned out, using boys to do the work. The work benches in 33 should be moved into the laundry where after being covered with (old) masonite they may be used as folding and sorting tables.\n\nI have had no word about the heating of these rooms and so it may be necessary temporarily to set up stoves as previously used, BUT with a cage surrounding them.\n\nPlumbing generally: The men who were promised for this morning have not turned up. A telephone call elicited the further promise that they would come as soon as possible.\n\nMattresses: Can you \"make do\" for the time being by using some of those bundles of Chapleau bedding as padding over the springs? I had an answer from the Youville school that they might dispose of some smaller mattresses (54 in long) but perhaps there will be better and larger ones available at other points. I am continuing inquiries.\n\nStaff quarters: As soon as Mr. Bear has finished your residence I suggest that you request Mr. Supt. Jones to have him get on with the rooms you want partitioned in Bldgs. No. 21 and 30. Meanwhile he may have to take a few hours off to do the work required in the infirmary and in the washrooms of 30.\n\nCopy to Mr. Jones.\n\nC.A.F. Clark\n\nIndian Affairs.

Please advise by return wire.\"\n\nMr. Clark who is mentioned in the telegram is our Educational Survey Officer who is now in Western Canada on an inspection trip. As you are aware, the Lac la Ronge School is being conducted in the Military Camp in Prince Albert and while we have supplied some mattresses, Mr. Clark considers that the additional number of mattresses are required immediately.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

Fisher,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential Schools,\nPRINCE ALBERT, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Mr. Fisher:\n\nWhen I was at Lytton a few days ago, Canon Hives showed me an organ which he would sell for one hundred dollars. It sounded all right to me and showed very little wear and tear no broken keys or woodwork.\n\nYour local C.P.R. office can give you a quotation on freight costs which I think would be a little more than from Winnipeg where you have another prospect at one hundred ninety-five dollars.\n\nBut perhaps by this time that local electric organ has been given another cut in price, or some philanthropic person or group has decided to present it to the school. It would certainly be a helpful acquisition to the school.\n\nThe Calgary price for mattresses ($4.50 plus freight) seems about as low as we shall get and I hope the firm will deal with you or Mr. Jones on that basis. I did not disclose my Government connections.\n\nIn regard to the work on the land for which I gave you a statement, the boys put in an additional twenty-one \"boy-hours\" and hence there is a fifty-dollar question to be addressed to Mr. Struthers. I hope that the money will provide several little radios (at reduced prices to the Government) for the boys' and girls' Assembly rooms.\n\nBy this time, perhaps, the rink is under construction.\n\nI presume that the plumbers and carpenters have got on the job and have stayed so that your residence, the dishwashing room, the infirmary, and dormitories and staff quarters have become usable, and will be brought to completion in short order. If my presumptions are wrong, please let me know, Q/C Mr. Davis in Winnipeg.\n\nDo I dare to hope that everybody, staff and students, is in good health again? I especially hope that your hand is mending well.\n\nPlease convey my regards to the staff -- I almost said \"to my colleagues\". I am glad to hear that you have received reinforcements.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nC.A.F. Clark.\n\nCopy to Superintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nIndian Affairs.

G. W. Fisher, L.Th.,\nPrincipal\n\nNovember 17th, 1948.\n\nAll Saints School\nPRINCE ALBERT, SASK.\nWinnipeg, Man.,\nNov. 23, 1948.\n\nE.S. Jones, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPrince Albert, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Jones:\n\nI have a letter from Rev. Mr. Fisher with the bad news that to the epidemic of mumps there has been added measles - fourteen cases. Further to complicate matters the M & K Plumbing Company has done nothing at all on the job which they promised to begin over two weeks ago. I do not think that Mr. Fisher can stand much more of that sort of discouragement. If there is any other firm which could get on with the job forthwith I would, if I were there, invite them to do so.\n\nIn regard to the broken piece on the washer the agents are writing to the manufacturers to make a new one. Mr. Fisher as the consignee must submit a claim to the carriers naming the part: \"Part No. 66; right hand bearing for 50 X 48 Globe Washer, serial no. 1213 M 7364\". He will have to include a copy of the invoice and a statement of charges for removing the old part and re-assembling the machine.\n\nMeanwhile if there is any welding shop in Prince Albert which can be trusted to do the job, they might be invited to try. They will have to supply the missing piece of metal.\n\nIn Elkhorn the Principal showed me a list of beds, etc., that he had shipped, saying that it might be necessary to make a few wooden bedsteads for the extra springs. I trust that the mattresses have been received.\n\nI suppose that the Sanitarium got those trays back in satisfactory condition now that the school has got trays of its own.\n\nPerhaps you have had word from Ottawa as to how those assembly rooms and the proposed chapel are to be heated. I have written to Ottawa suggesting the purchase of an organ from the Lytton Residential School.\n\nAlthough the plane pilot says the ice is not yet dependable, I suppose the school rink is now furnishing some amusement.\n\nI would imagine that the cold weather called a\nhalt to further work on preparing the garden land.\n\nNow that Mr. Waterhouse should have recovered from the mumps (unless he has fallen a victim to the measles) he might get on with that comparatively simple job of adjusting the hot water pipes in Miss Hodd's room. The children cannot be expected to put up with those temperatures much longer, and the teacher's constant complaints are just one more unnecessary annoyance for a harassed Principal.\n\nI hope that something has been done to overcome the shortages in kitchen and dining-room equipment and that the dishwashing is being done according to plan.\n\nI asked Mr. Piercy to defer his inspection of the classroom work on the ground that sickness was making things difficult, but we cannot postpone a visit from him much longer and he has a quick eye for shortcomings.\n\nKindest regards to your wife and office colleagues.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.A.F. Clark\nNovember 20th, 1948.\n\nRev. G. W. Fisher, L.Th.,\nPrincipal\n\nMr. C. A. F. Clark,\nC/o Mr. R. S. Davis,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nFederal Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nDear Mr. Clark:\n\nThanks for your letter of November 17th. After you left, I unfortunately had to spend six days in the hospital. The wound in my hand became infected, and the doctor advised me to lay up for a few days, particularly as I was running a rather high temperature. But I am glad to say I am feeling quite all right now.\n\nSo far, your plumbers have not shown up, so most things are as they were, save for the work that Waterhouse did in the hospital. Gilbert is doing a very good job there, but so far he has not got beyond working in the hospital building. I think it will be best for him to go to the other dormitory building next - Hut 30.\n\nRe the mattresses, it is my understanding that Mr. Jones has wired Ottawa for authority to purchase.\n\nAbout the organ you saw at Lytton, I don't know what to say. I wish the Government would take the matter in hand, and would purchase an organ and send it to us. We certainly need an instrument badly.\n\nYou will be sorry to hear we are having a measles epidemic now. To-day their ten boys and four girls down. I suppose this will last for quite a while.\n\nMay I ask that you do all you can to expedite the setting up of the laundry. Nothing more has been done, and we are finding it increasingly difficult to carry on as we are. It is really quite a bother to haul things backwards and forwards to St. Alban's.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nCOPY: Original sent to Winnipeg.\nFor La Ronge Expenditures\n\nFeb 2/48\nNovember 4091.46\n   Furniture 657.43\n   Storage Batteries 21.00\n   Hardware Supplies 3.31\n   Material & Labor (Pipe, Hacks) 250.73\n   Beds, Springs & Mattresses 416.02\n   Furniture & Dishes 2969.87\n   April Serving Machines 272.80\n   Decks 1875.96\n   Light Bulbs 12.55\n   May Merchandise 284.06\n   Window Chairs 115.35\n   Garden Tools 86.53\n   Stone, Pipes, etc. 101.64\n   Dining Room Table 42.00\n   Straining Frog 41.75\n   June Furniture - Chesterfield etc. 472.30\n   Electric Range 167.10\n   Refrigerator 260.79\n   Radios, Lamps etc. 76.49\n   Boiler, Cake Pan etc. 43.70\n   Walnut Finish Chairs 81.00\n   August November 302.36\n   Arm Chair, Typewriter Bookcase 131.81\n   Unloading & Tackling Furniture 98.50\n   Paint 79.20\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mackay  \nActing Director  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. of Mines & Resources  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is hoped that I shall be able to call on you towards the end of this present week. One of the matters which is of concern to the Administration is somewhat covered in the enclosed copy of Principal Fisher's letter. I have posted it to you in the hope that time will allow you to digest its contents before our meeting. I hope to visit Prince Albert within ten days and would like to be in a position to discuss this matter intelligently with Mr. Fisher and your Agent.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHGC:MNA  \nSuperintendent\nThe Superintendent\nIndian School Administration\n102 Bank St. Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSome time ago I wrote you regarding the lack of progress being made in the completion of the \"set-up\" of All Saints School, and in response to your Night Letter, I talked over quite frankly all the matters I had written about in my letters, with Mr. Clark. But I cannot say that things are very much better.\n\nAs possibly you may be aware, Mr. Clark has been in Prince Albert at least twice since the go ahead signal was given to get the Barracks buildings ready for occupation. He has submitted certain plans and suggestions to the Indian Affairs Branch, covering Laundry, Garden, Dormitories, Hospital, and What-not? And with all this things are still going round in circles. The fact seems to be that no one person appears to have authority to really do things. To me it sometimes appears that the local Indian Agent and Mr. Clark are at cross purposes. Mr. Jones had one plan, and Mr. Clark comes in and scraps the plan. This is what has happened in connection with the laundry. The result is, whether Mr. Clark's plan is the better or not, the fact remains, that while we have the laundry equipment, we still have no laundry at All Saints, and all laundry is being done at St. Alban's for both schools, which while it was all right as a temporary measure (for a few weeks) is not suitable for the length of time we have been operating.\n\nThe cause of the trouble is in my opinion, that no overall plan was drawn up for the setting up of the school from the point of view of the utilizing of the buildings to the best advantage. I feel that an architect should have been employed to have drawn the plans. Nothing of this kind was done.\n\nThen the Government did not appropriate enough money for the carrying out of the work. I understand $10,000.00 was allowed. Again not enough men have been employed. The idea seems to have been also to get the job done as cheaply as possible, though at the same time some men employed have received top wages. Our own Mr. Waterhouse has done a considerable amount of the plumbing work. And so it goes on.\n\nI wonder if you can tell me just what Mr. Clark's position is. I know what his official title is. But he seems to have so much to say re the planning of the school, and yet appears to have little authority to spend money to get things done. And in the end I feel I am getting blamed all round for many things for which I am not responsible. I do wish some action could be taken to get things really finished.\nREGINA DECEMBER 8/48\n\nRE TEL HEATING ARRANGEMENTS AT PRINCE ALBERT NOT AS ALARMING AS CANNON COOK WIRES WOULD INDICATE STOP\n\nSUPT.

The one exception is the latest suggestion for a laundry installation in Hut 33 of which I made only one drawing to scale and gave that to the Principal with an oral description only to Mr. Superintendent Jones. I have not seen or heard that any other plans or alterations were ever finalized on paper. The plans, if any, for the Principal's residence, married quarters and staff rooms were largely, I believe, determined by the Principal himself and he had more time and opportunity than anyone else to supervise construction and prevent the causes for complaints now being received.\n\nAs the records show, I did in August intervene in regard to the classrooms so as to plan adequate fenestration and blackboard space with some attention to heating.\n\nI accept full responsibility for planning the infirmary which is usable as a dormitory for both boys and girls during periods when attendance may be low and dormitories 29, 30 and 31 may be closed.\n\nI was not authorized to reduce the allotment of air space in dormitories. In buildings ten feet high and twenty-three feet wide single beds would be allowable along each wall on a scale of one every four feet. Thus a dormitory wing 100 feet long could accommodate sixty beds with little space between. For the pupilage of 210 the dormitory space used should be 460 feet in length at a minimum and if reasonable spacing of beds is desired 525 feet is suggested. In either case it requires two buildings and a considerable part of a third building to accommodate 210 pupils, staff and storage facilities.\nThe Regional Supervisor has indicated that there might well be some staff adjustments. Some of the personnel concerning whom the Principal expressed to me varying degrees of dissatisfaction are:\n\nMr. Harris, the office man\nMrs. Harris, the nurse\nMr. Calrow, the fireman\nMr. Egerton, a boys' supervisor\nMr. Edwards\nMiss Joyce, a girls' supervisor\nMiss Neville,\nMiss Hauver, the primary teacher\nMr. Waterhouse, the engineer\n\nAs some of these people insisted on expressing their grievances to me, I find myself in agreement with Mr. Ostrander that a number of changes should be made.\n\nC.A.F.

Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan.\n\nRe: Requisitions for Furniture and\nOther Supplies Lac La Ronge\nIndian Residential School\n\nWith reference to your requisitions of 7th January\nand 18th January, we are requesting the Departmental Purchasing\nAgent to purchase the majority of the items asked for on\nthe requisition dated 7th January, with the exception of the\nfurniture for the Principal's residence and for the quarters\nof the married members of the staff.\n\nWe have not yet requested the Purchasing Agent to\norder the items mentioned on your requisition of 18th January.\nThe action in this regard is due to the destruction of the\nPrincipal's residence by fire. It is presumed that the quarters\nfor the married members of the staff may have been altered.\n\nAs a consequence of the conditions which have now\narisen, we feel that a new requisition should be forwarded\nfor the furnishings, as no doubt you will wish to increase\nthese to provide furnishings for the building that will be\noccupied by the Principal, as you state in your telegram\nof 23rd January that these furnishings were destroyed by\nthe fire.\n\nWe are not ordering a new potato peeler as we discussed\nthis request with Regional Supervisor Ostrander, and we were\ninformed that there is a potato peeler at the school at the\npresent time which could easily be repaired and used.\n\nWhen submitting the new requisition, you should\nforward two lists as follows:\n\n......2\n(a) Furniture for Principal's residence.\n(b) Furnishings for the quarters for the married members of the staff.\n\nWe would also appreciate receiving sketches of the plan of the quarters to be used by the married members of the staff and the names of the occupants.\n\nWe have not ordered the 230 window blinds. We understand that at least half the windows in most of the buildings face north, and in addition, that in some of the buildings there appears to be no need for shutting out light or obscuring the view from outside. We would appreciate it if you would survey the building with the Principal and advise us how many window blinds you consider are actually necessary.\n\nBernard F.

Please issue Purchase Order so that the account may be paid. The coding is as follows:\n\n656-516-13-491.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n1st February, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe attached Voucher has recently been received from Superintendent Jones in connection with work done by the M. & K. Plumbing and Heating Company at the Lac la Ronge School.\n\nFrom the outset I may say that the amount of the account is a great deal larger than we expected, and we have nothing to indicate whether this firm has discontinued working on these buildings. Does Superintendent Jones oversee the work they are doing in order to make certain that they will not be employed for a longer time than necessary?\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would review the enclosed account and let us know if you think it is reasonable, and if so, we would be glad if you would ask Superintendent Jones to give us some definite idea regarding the work actually being done by the M. & K. Plumbing Company for the payment of $1,559.17 which they request.\n\nIs this Company still working at the school, and if so what are they doing? Are there any additional accounts that the M. & K. Plumbing Company will desire us to pay? If so, these must be forwarded immediately but we will probably have some trouble in having them passed for payment.\n\nWhen forwarding the accounts you should have the M. & K. Plumbing Company divide them in such a manner so as to show the building number at which work was done. I note that Voucher No. 42 evidently covers work done at Hut No. 21 and Hut No. 30.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n1st February, 1949.\n\nMr. E.S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan\n\nWe have your letter of the 12th ultimo enclosing Voucher No. 6 amounting to $237.60, covering the cost of 12 tables for the Lac la Ronge School. It is noted that you state that these tables were purchased by the late Principal without your knowledge.\n\nHowever, before we can pay the account, we will have to submit it to the Departmental Purchasing Agent for a Purchase Order, and we have no information on our file regarding what use will be made of these tables. It appears that they are only 3' x 2'.\n\nWe would also like to know why 12 tables were required, and in what rooms they are being used and for what purpose. Do you consider the price charged by the Prince Albert Manufacturing Company a reasonable one?\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nFurther to my letter 1355-1-30A (107) of January 27, 1949.\n\nI am enclosing herewith tenders submitted in connection with work to be done on building No. 32 as follows;\n\nMr. W.

The carpenter, Gilbert Bear (Indian), who did the work may have had a plan, but I didn't see it, and when the work was nearing completion, the late Principal expressed to me some disappointment at the result. The location, shape and dimensions of the rooms did not present the result for which he had hoped. For example, please note the living-room. For this they purchased a carpet with rather unusual dimensions (6'x16') and a Chesterfield suite and two chairs. It seems a pity that the public should spend nearly seven thousand dollars on carpentry alone to achieve a residence that may not afford convenience or satisfaction to the occupants.\n\nI would earnestly recommend a revision of the plans, and the submission of them for your opinion.\n\nC.A.T.

Heary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School\n\nI have just returned from a visit to the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School and I find that Mr. Mayo is making a remarkably good job of bringing order out of chaos at that school. He has been informed that he is to be replaced by a Reverend Mr. Scrase on the 15th of this month.\n\nMr. Mayo is very conscientious, and although he took temporary charge of the Lac la Ronge School, following the death of the Reverend Mr. C.W. Fisher, more or less unwillingly, he would now be glad to continue to the end of the present term.\n\nI would be very glad if the officials of the M.S.C.C. could be persuaded to delay the appointment of Mr. Scrase at that school until after the 30th of June. I do not know Mr. Scrase, and it may be presumption on my part to suggest that he will not be as successful as Mr. Mayo, in setting up the school. However, I have a great deal of confidence in Mr. Mayo, and his sound judgment, and I do not like to see another change of principals during the present term. The management of the school has suffered greatly by inefficiency during this term, and conditions will certainly not be improved by making another change of principals toward the end of the term. Mr. Mayo did not ask me to write on his behalf, but he did inform me that he is willing to stay until the end of the term if it is considered desirable.\n\nFor the first time since the school was opened, Mr. Jones, our Superintendent, feels that real progress is being made, and that, in Mr. Mayo, he has a man with whom he can really do business. In fairness to Mr. Jones I believe that every effort should be made to persuade the Church Authorities to allow Mr. Mayo to remain at least until the end of June.\n\nAuthority has not yet been received for repairing the Principal's residence, damaged by fire, therefore the residence cannot possibly be ready for occupancy by Mr. Scrase and his family on the 15th of February. Mr. Mayo is living at a hotel in Prince Albert, at the expense of the school, and if Mr. Scrase arrives with his family, in Prince Albert on the 15th of February, they, too, will have to live at the hotel. This suggests that it is unwise to move Mr. Scrase to Prince Albert at the present time. The whole of the interior of the Principal's residence is covered with ice and littered with debris of all kinds. Naturally, all of the windows are broken, and have to be closed up temporarily in order to heat the building sufficiently to thaw out the ice and clean it out in preparation for repairing. From its present appearance I would say that it will take several days of heating the building before any action can be taken to repair it, consequently it will be seen that it is impossible to have it ready by the 15th of February, in view of the fact that authority has not yet been received to commence. The contractor has suggested that it will take about two weeks to do the work....\ntwo weeks to do the work from the date of commencement. Possibly it can be done in two weeks, but I am extremely doubtful.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n7th February, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCOLONEL NEARY\n\nRe: Hut No. 22 - Prince Albert Barracks\n\nThis morning I had a discussion with Mr. C.S. Boucher of the Leases Section, Department of Public Works. He stated that their files did not appear to show any reason why the Provincial Government should be requested to vacate the building. He suggested that a request should go forward to the Deputy Minister of his Department supported by quotations from the Anglican Church officials. I got the impression that Mr. Boucher would want a pretty strong case made before he would recommend terminating the tenancy of a Government which has spent $10,000.00 on the building.\n\nAs an alternative to Hut No. 22, or to repairing Hut No. 32, Mr. Boucher suggested that we satisfy ourselves that there is no other building in the camp which would suit our purpose. To that end I attach a draft of a letter to Mr. Superintendent Jones.\n\nC.A.F. Clark,\nEducational Survey Officer\n\nAttach.\nMr. E.S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nBox 787, Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nRe: Accommodation for Principal,\nLac la Ronge Indian Residential School\n\nWe are required to determine whether there is in the barracks area, any building other than Huts Nos. 22 and 32 which could be used for the above mentioned purpose without incurring the very considerable expense involved in restoring Hut No. 32, or inconveniencing the occupants of Hut No. 22.\n\nIt is understood that you have abandoned the attempt to remodel the house which was designated for the Agency Assistant. Would this house, or any of the R.C.M.P. houses, be readily usable as a Principal's residence?\n\nAlternatively, would one wing of the empty building next to Hut No. 21 (probably numbered 20) suit the purpose? Or if not, is there any other building that would?\n\nIt is desirable to select a building that has not been \"cannibalized\" to the extent that we would have to restore the heating system, plumbing, etc., and fit up a kitchen in a place where no chimney was intended.\n\nIn making your recommendations, please include a diagram of what it is proposed to do, and a fairly close estimate of the cost involved.\n\nIt is desired to accelerate action in this matter.\n\nC.A.F. Officer\nEducational Survey Officer\nMr. Philan:\n\nRepairs to Hut 32, Prince Albert Barracks:\n\nPursuant to instructions I attempted to discuss this matter with Dept. of Public Works. Mr. Boucher's secretary informed me that it appeared to be in order to ask D.P.W. to make the repairs. It will, however, require a memo to the Chief Architect, Mr. Gustave Brault, and might well be supported by copies of the offers we have received from local contractors.\n\nD.P.W. would, the lady says, in due course receive reports of the damage from the resident architect in Saskatoon and from Mr. Ramage (mentioned by Mr. Jones). These reports have not yet, however, come to her attention.\n\nAction along these lines is not, I understand, to be taken unless the need to use Blay 32 is indicated by Mr. Jones' answer to our wire of today.\n\nC.A.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nFurther to my night letter of January 23rd, reporting fire in Hut No. 32, Prince Albert Army Camp:\n\nThe interior of the hut in question was completely renovated for use, except for minor details. One portion was storage for school supplies, food, clothing and classroom materials and was in use. The other portion had been made ready as office and Principal's quarters. The Acting Principal, Mr. Mayo, had made arrangements to move in January 24th. Mrs. Davidson, School Matron, had taken up temporary quarters in this building.\n\nMrs. Davidson left the building at 7.30 a.m. for breakfast in the dining hall. Mr. Kirton, Department of Public Works caretaker walked past the building at 8.00 a.m. and neither Mrs. Davidson nor Mr. Kirton noted any indication of fire. However, when Mr. Kirton returned to his home at 8.15 a.m., he saw smoke pouring out of one window of the building. He raised the alarm and called the City Fire Department. I arrived at 8.25 a.m., the fire department arrived and were in action at 8.30 a.m.\n\nWhen the fire was extinguished, Mr. Fred Turner, City Fire Chief, and I examined the building. The east end of the building was badly burned but not beyond repair. The office and storage quarters were damaged only by smoke and water. The school supplies stored in the west end of the building were slightly damaged by smoke and water but practically all are usable.\n\nThe whole of the furnishings supplied by our Branch for the Principal's living quarters must be considered a total loss, with the exception of one bed outfit, which can be refinished. The refrigerator and electric stove were salvaged and placed in the Agency Warehouse. Mr. Ramag, Department of Public Works, has since condemned both declaring them useless and in the case of the refrigerator, a menace. He made arrangements for both articles to be demolished.\n\nAs a point of interest, the building heating unit valued at $4,000.00 is intact and undamaged.\n\nover..\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nMr. Ostrander, Regional Supervisor, instructed me to obtain prices for repairs in connection with building No. 32, partially destroyed by fire recently. Estimates will be placed in the mail tomorrow, January 28th.\n\nBy telephone, the following are the estimated prices received:\n- Structural work by W. I. Dier, contractor Prince Albert $3,300.00\n- Plumbing, M & K, Prince Albert $600.00\n- Electrical work, Stewart Electric Prince Albert, $400.00\n- Decorating, Mr. Holyreayd, Prince Albert, $500.00\n\nTotal $4,800.00.\n\nThe above prices have met with the approval of Mr. J.

Jones, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nDear Mr. Jones:\n\nHaving reference to our conversation and my inspection of the building, being building #32 at Ex. 122 C.V.T.S., Prince Albert. I recommend that all chimneys in all buildings be examined, wood work will be re-arranged so as to allow for air space of not less than 2\" between brick and woodwork. All insulation be removed when such insulation is in contact with brick or woodwork.\n\nThe brick surfaces should be plastered and all chimneys left in a condition where there shall be no contact with any wood or other structural material. There shall further be an air space of not less than 2\" between all structural material and any brick surface, thus allowing of free circulation of air, thus allowing of dissipation of heat.\n\nA further and complete report shall be forwarded to you at the earliest possible moment.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.

Murphy, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nPrince Albert - ex-Army Basic Training Centre.\n\nDear Mr. Murphy:\n\nYou will recall our previous correspondence concerning the use of certain of the buildings at this former Basic Training Centre as temporary quarters for the La Loche Indian Residential School.\n\nBy now, you will have received reports from your District Engineer concerning the burning of building No. 32 at this camp. I understand that the technical report covering the causes of this fire indicates faulty construction as the main reason for its partial destruction.\n\nUnfortunately, this has deprived the administration of the school of a principal's residence. This has happened at a time when we were appointing a new principal to replace the Reverend Mr. Fisher who died suddenly. The new principal is a married man with two small children and we are anxious to provide him with a suitable residence. Originally we were intending to approach you with regard to repairing building No. 32, partially destroyed by the fire mentioned above. However, it has now been drawn to our attention that the Provincial Department of Reconstruction intends to vacate this building. I attach, for your information, a copy of a letter from the Honourable Mr. Sturdy to your District Resident Architect in this regard. There are\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6317, file 656-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nfive small suites in building No. 22 which are at present being rented. It is presumed that the occupants are the families of provincial civil servants connected with the Forestry School and that when these officials are moved to the new site of the school, these suites will be vacated.\n\nIt would be appreciated, therefore, if this building No. 22 could be made available for use as a principal's residence, staff residence and additional classroom when vacated by the provincial department concerned. In this way an expenditure of approximately $5,000.00 in restoring building 32 can be avoided and suitable accommodation provided for the new principal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In all probability the purchase order was forwarded direct to the Principal at the school.\n\nE. S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\n\nESJ/AG\nFeb. 18, 1949.\n\nMrs. Philan:\n\nLaundry, Lac la Ronge:\n\nThe installation cost was high and will be high also for setting it up in the Drill Hall lean-to where a chimney will be necessary and a hot water tank will have to be added. Moreover, space in the Drill Hall will hardly be adequate for the size of installation required unless the vehicle shelter and engineer's garage and workshop are disposed elsewhere.\n\nI suggest that Stanley Brock, Ltd. of Winnipeg, who sold us the machinery, be requested to have their traveler call at Prince Albert and look over the present installation and also at the suggested site. He could then tell us what is wrong with the present set-up (a) what adjustments are needed (b) how the machinery should be set up in the Drill Hall\u2014using the new units and the usable old ones so that laundering is not a time-consuming chore.\n\nThe Drill Hall would, I agree, have been the more convenient site, but the school, without notice to us, took two-thirds of the space for a garage and workshop.\n\nC.A.T.

Your firm supplied the laundry machinery (see Purchase Order 31447, dated 25th June, 1948).\n\nAt present the machinery is placed in what is known as Building 33, but we have had complaints that it is difficult to keep the water lines from freezing.\n\nIt is proposed to transfer the machinery to the building formerly used as a drill hall. I would also add that we have had several complaints regarding the operation of the machinery, due partly or wholly, I believe, to faulty installation.\n\nIf one of your experts on laundry machinery is in the vicinity of the camp in the near future, we would appreciate it if he would look over the situation with a view to making suggestions to the management and also submitting us a report along the following lines:\n\n(a) Is there anything wrong with the present setup?\n(b) Are any adjustments required?\n(c) What units received from the Chapleau school are usable?\n(d) The manner in which the machinery should be setup in the drill hall - using the new units and the usable old units so that the laundering may be handled as quickly and as conveniently as possible.\nIf you can co-operate with us in the near future with regard to the above, we would appreciate hearing from you as soon as possible, so that we may notify our Indian Superintendent at Prince Albert and also the Principal of the school that your representative may be expected.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nExpenditure incurred by Indian Superintendent E.

Plumbing and Heating Company, Prince Albert, for $1559.17, enclosed is copy of a letter received from Superintendent E.S. Jones, of the Carlton Agency, in this connection. Also enclosed are rough drafts prepared by Mr. G.A.F. Clark, on which most of the work covered by this voucher was outlined.\n\nI discussed this matter with Superintendent Jones when I visited the Carlton Agency recently, and our examination of the invoices at that time disclosed the fact that the invoices which showed expenditure of $667.41 on Hut #21, and $891.76 on Hut #30 were not entirely correct as to the buildings on which the expenditure took place. On $891.76 shown as Hut #30, approximately $640.00 should have been shown as expended on Building #33 for the purpose of converting part of that building into a laundry. The discrepancy was not noticed when the voucher was originally submitted.\n\nPlans had been made, and work commenced to install the laundry machinery in Building #27 (lean-to of the drill hall). In Mr. Jones' absence the late Reverend Mr. Fisher apparently persuaded Mr. Clark to change Mr. Jones' plans and have the laundry in Building #33 which, I am certain, was a mistake. The original intention was to have the laundry, storage place for clothing, and sewing and mending room all under one roof. The lean-to of Building #27 was quite suitable for this purpose. Under the present arrangement the clothing has to be washed in Building #33 and this results in a lot of carrying of clothing back and forth between that building and Building #27 for mending and storage purposes.\n\nAt the time of my last visit to the Lac la Ronge School, the 3rd and 4th of February, the plumbers were completing the installation of the laundry machinery in Building #33, and arrangements had been made to try it the following day, the 5th of February. As I had returned to Regina the night of the 4th and 5th, I was not there when the laundry machinery was put to work, but the remarks of Mr. Jones in the last paragraph of the letter enclosed would indicate that they had trouble with the water lines in the laundry as the result of freezing. I am not surprised at this, and there is no doubt in my mind that the laundry will have to be installed in Building #27, as originally intended.\n\nThe part of Building #33 in which the laundry was installed was the kitchen. The kitchen ranges and other kitchen equipment were moved out of the space in order to install the laundry machinery. The expense in this connection was not serious, but the installation of the laundry machinery cost a considerable amount of money, which may be considered to have been wasted. Mr. Mayo is now in charge at the Lac la Ronge School, and he admits that there was a serious mistake made in not installing the laundry machinery in Building #27 and he is quite satisfied that it must be installed in that building before it will be satisfactory. He even suggested that if it was decided by the Department that it was the fault of the late Mr. Fisher that the change was made without Mr. Jones' approval, he would prefer...\nto see all of the cost of re-assembling the laundry machinery in Building #27 assumed by the school than to see the laundry kept in its present unsatisfactory location. This, of course, will be a matter for the Department to decide with the Church Authorities. In any case, regardless of the decision as to who should pay the cost of re-installing the machinery in Building #27, it should be done in the spring as soon as the weather is suitable. I have instructed Mr. Jones to have the M. & K. Plumbing Company submit a quotation covering the change immediately after the end of the present fiscal year, and I have informed him that I shall recommend it.\n\nIn the meantime I would recommend that Voucher #42 for $1,559.17, be paid, as the work referred to therein was performed, and the M. & K. Plumbing and Heating Company should be paid.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nFebruary 10, 1949.\n\nMr. E. S.

Murphy, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nPrince Albert - ex-Army Basic Training Centre.\n\nDear Mr. Murphy:\n\nYou will recall our previous correspondence concerning the use of certain of the buildings at this former Basic Training Centre as temporary quarters for the Liz Ronge Indian Residential School.\n\nBy now, you will have received reports from the District Engineer concerning the burning of building No. 32 at this camp. I understand that the technical report covering the causes of this fire indicates faulty construction as the main reason for its partial destruction.\n\nUnfortunately, this has deprived the administration of the school of a principal's residence. This has happened at a time when we were appointing a new principal to replace the Reverend Mr. Fisher who died suddenly. The new principal is a married man with two small children and we are anxious to provide him with a suitable residence. Originally we were intending to approach you with regard to repairing building No. 32, partially destroyed by the fire mentioned above. However, it has now been drawn to our attention that the Provincial Department of Reconstruction intends to vacate this building. I attach, for your information, a copy of a letter from the Honourable Mr. Sturdy to your District Resident Architect in this regard. There are\nfive small suites in building No. 22 which are at present being rented. It is presumed that the occupants are the families of provincial civil servants connected with the Forestry School and that when these officials are moved to the new site of the school, these suites will be vacated.\n\nIt would be appreciated, therefore, if this building No. 22 could be made available for use as a principal's residence, staff residence and additional classroom when vacated by the provincial department concerned. In this way an expenditure of approximately $5,000.00 in restoring building 12 can be avoided and suitable accommodation provided for the new principal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. L.

I am still of the opinion that Mr. Mayo should continue in charge of the Lac la Ronge School until the end of the present term.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nExtract from the quarterly report of the Saskatchewan Administrative Region for the period ending March 31st, 1949.\n\nI am still of the opinion that the residential school at Prince Albert known as the Lac la Ronge School should be further enlarged in order to provide accommodation for the large number of children in the northern part of the province where we have no school facilities, and where the establishment of day schools is impractical. Of course, a large school requires a capable Principal, with a competent and trustworthy staff. There has been some improvement in the personnel at the Lac La Ronge School during recent months, but further improvement is needed. Much of the trouble of the late Mr. Fisher could be attributed to an incompetent staff, and many of the complaints about the operation of the school could be traced directly to incompetence.\n\n(Sgd) J.

Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nThere has been considerable correspondence with the Department of Education of the Province of Saskatchewan and Bishop Martin of Saskatchewan, concerning this project. The original plan was for the erection of a hostel to be operated by the M.S.C.C. for the children from the hostel to attend a provincial school at Lac la Ronge. We are agreed that the operation of such a school is feasible but have run into an obstacle with regard to the hiring of Anglican teachers in the school to be operated by the Provincial Department of Education. It is felt that this matter can best be straightened out either by having our Superintendent of Education visit Regina or by having Mr. G. H. Piercy, B.A., Administrator of Education for Northern Saskatchewan, at Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, visit Ottawa.\nApril 26th, 1949.\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nIndian Agency\nP. O.

Residential School. We have examined these in some detail to ascertain their suitability for erection at Lac la Ronge. You will recall our discussion concerning the use of the playrooms as classrooms on a temporary basis.\n\nOur conclusions are as follows:\n\n(1) In their present form the playrooms of this dormitory block would not be suitable as classrooms as they have only a fenestration of 10%. It would be possible to convert them by\n\n(a) Changing the windows to 12 lights 12\" x 18\". This would probably involve a change of all the windows of the building in order to have conformity of appearance.\n\n(b) The installation of proper electric lighting facilities.\n\n(2) The removal of recreational space from a dormitory block would be exceedingly difficult for supervisory personnel. You are well aware of the need for playing space in our residential schools, particularly in areas where the winters are long and cold.\nIn view of the decreased appropriation presently available for the construction of new buildings, I would prefer to proceed with the erection of day schools and delay the erection of this dormitory block. However, this is a matter of policy which I would like to discuss with you at an opportune time.\n\nBernard F.

You will recall our discussion concerning the use of the playrooms as classrooms on a temporary basis.\n\nOur conclusions are as follows:\n\n(1) In their present form the playrooms of this dormitory block would not be suitable as classrooms as they have only a fenestration of 10%. It would be possible to convert them by\n\n(a) Changing the windows to 12 lights 12\" x 18\". This would probably involve a change of all the windows of the building in order to have conformity of appearance.\n\n(b) The installation of proper electric lighting facilities.\n\n(2) The removal of recreational space from a dormitory block would be exceedingly difficult for supervisory personnel. You are well aware of the need for playing space in our residential schools, particularly in areas where the winters are long and cold.\nIn view of the decreased appropriation presently available for the construction of new buildings, I would prefer to proceed with the erection of day schools and delay the erection of this dormitory block. However, this is a matter of policy which I would like to discuss with you at an opportune time.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n23rd April, 1949.\n\nMr. E.S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nPrince Albert, Saskatchewan.\n\nPlease find attached a self-explanatory letter which Canon Cook has received from Mr. Borase. Could you please advise by telegram if you have any indication that the Provincial Government is vacating Building 32. If not, it is our intention to contact the Department of Public Works in Ottawa regarding this building.\n\nI would also advise that additional funds have been provided for further repairs to these buildings, and we are prepared to meet recommendations from you and requisitions for the necessary materials. I would suggest that these be submitted as soon as possible, so that the work can be carried out during the summer holidays.\n\n(sgd) Bernard F. Neary\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nReference letter 658-5 (E) of April 23rd, 1949 regarding buildings at Ex. 122 Prince Albert.\n\nThe Forestry School course has been completed, staff and students have vacated Building No. 32. Provincial authorities converted one portion of this building into temporary suites. Two are still occupied, the occupants intend moving out as quickly as other accommodation can be found.\n\nIf the matter has not already been attended to, I would suggest the Department of Public Works be contacted with a view to having the building turned over to our Branch, to be added to the All Saints School.\n\nReference the last paragraph of your letter. Additional alterations to buildings, new fixtures and new equipment are necessary.\n\nI have from time to time advised the Department that arrangements should be made to bring in children from the northern portion of this Agency who have no school facilities available. Before submitting recommendations, may I please be advised if it is intended to increase the pupilage in this school. Failing this, as previously recommended, pupils now in residence at All Saints from Manitoba should be accommodated at other schools.\n\nAgainst my better judgement, with a view to satisfying the late Rev. Fisher and others, I permitted minor alterations to be made which were not practical. I am going to request Mr. Ostrander to come to Prince Albert.\nI AM GOING TO REQUEST Mr. Ostrander to come to Prince Albert. I will arrange the services of an Architect gratis and the three of us, together with the Principal, will decide what additional alterations are necessary and let that be the end of it.\n\nRegarding Mr. Scrase' letter to Canon Cook, a copy of which was enclosed with your letter. Due to the number of fires started in the various buildings due to the careless use of electrical appliances, the City Fire Chief forbid their use.\n\nFor example, the new ironer supplied. The night watch-man went on duty at 6.00 p.m., entering the laundry he found the ironer bursting into flames. Cause; switch left on when building was vacated. On two other occasions an ordinary electric iron was left plugged in, the building vacated, when discovered the irons had burned into the table half an inch.\n\nOn one inspection, the Fire Chief found heaters and hot plates left switched on in staff rooms when the occupants were out, hence his ruling that no electric appliances to be used in staff bed-rooms.\n\nTurning to the second last paragraph of Mr. Scrase' letter regarding the staff threatening to resign, Mr. Scrase admitted to me yesterday, that it would be a blessing if half of the present staff would resign.\n\nE.

It is noted that the Forestry School course has been completed and the staff have vacated Building No. 32.\n\nWhile you state that two of the temporary suites are still occupied, it is presumed that part of the building is at present available. Would it not be possible for the Principal to use the unoccupied suites temporarily until the whole building is available? If you have not already done so, I would suggest that you discuss the matter with the local representative of the Department of Public Works with a view to obtaining his assistance in moving out the people who are still occupying the two temporary suites in the building.\n\nI note that arrangements are being made to have Regional Supervisor Ostrander visit the school with a view to determining what additional alterations and new equipment will be necessary.\n\nThe Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Saskatchewan, will re-open on September 1st.

We would, therefore, appreciate any action you could take to point out to the members of the staff the extreme necessity for exercising every possible precaution.\n\nMr. Ostreider and Mr. Jones are giving careful consideration to additional alterations that may be required at this school, and I expect to receive a report from them in the near future. When it is received, we will give it careful attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nMay 5, 1949.\n\nColonel B.F.

Cook, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nThe Indian School Administration,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant regarding the Lac la Ronge Residential School, Indian Superintendent Jones advises us in a letter of the 5th instant that Mr. Ostrander intended to visit the school in the near future, and at that time Mr. Ostrander and Mr. Jones would decide what additional alterations and equipment would be required and would communicate with us.\n\nAs soon as their report is received, their recommendations will receive careful consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nPP/ST Supt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am in receipt of Department letter of the 5th instant, File 656-5 (E.I.), with which was enclosed copy of a letter which the Director received from Reverend H.G. Cook, of the Anglican Indian School Administration, and relating to the expenditure of $674.51 in hotel accommodation, meals, etc. for the Principals of the Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School while awaiting preparation of suitable accommodation for them on the school premises.\n\nWhile it may be true that the Church Authorities were put to some expense through the fact that there was no residence accommodation for the Principals at the Lac la Ronge School for a period, it does not appear to me that it was all the fault of the Department. It will be remembered that it was fully understood when the new Lac la Ronge School was to be opened at Prince Albert that until it was open and completed for operation, the late Reverend C.W. Fisher would act as Principal at that school and also at the St. Alban's School. He had accommodation for himself at the St. Alban's School, for which the Department was paying rent. The fact that Mr. Fisher was physically unsuited to such a difficult position is certainly not the fault of the Department. If he had been physically suited, much of our difficulty in connection with this school would have been lessened, and some considerable proportion of the cost of the opening of the new Lac la Ronge School would also have been less under proper management.\n\nIt is my opinion that it would be reasonable for our Department to make a grant to the Church of a portion of the cost of providing accommodation for Mr. Mayo and the Reverend Mr. Scrase. Certainly I do not think that our Department should pay all of it as it covered meals, as well as hotel accommodation. I would recommend that an amount of $300.00 be granted to the M.S.C.C. as what I consider a fair share of this cost.\n\nJ.P.B.

Barracks\nPrince Albert, Sask.\n\nIn connection with the fire in January last which destroyed the building fitted up as a Principal's Residence, we have just effected a settlement with our insurance company. In forwarding their cheque the Company write as follows and ask that we take the matter up with you in order that the inspection recommended may be expedited.\n\n\"The buildings used by the School Administration are converted Army Huts, and in making his inspection and investigation for the Federal Government, Mr. Ramage of the Department of Public Works made recommendation to his Chief that the wiring in all buildings should be inspected by a competent licenced, registered electrician and that all chimneys be stripped and examined to make sure that an adequate air space should be left between the chimneys and wood-work.\n\nAs we understand this loss was caused by the wood-work being built tight against the chimney, we would much appreciate if Canon Cook would use his influence to have the inspection recommended by Mr. Ramage carried out as quickly as possible, so as to prevent any further fire occurring from the same cause or from the electric wiring.\"\n\nThe suggestion of Mr. Ramage appears to be very sound and it is suggested that it is in the interest of all concerned that the inspection of wiring and of space between chimneys and adjacent wood-work be carried out at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHenry G.

No doubt heaters and hot plates were left on in an attempt to heat up the staff rooms.\n\nI shall await, with keen interest, the report of Mr. Ostrander and Mr. Jones regarding alterations to staff quarters.

The Provincial Government would not release the building to Public Works on account of some of their staff living in suites in one-half of the building; the excuse being that living quarters were not available in the city of Prince Albert. This is where Mr. Hewett entered the discussion, and I would gather from Mr. Churchman's letter that he is the last Provincial Forestry Officer residing in the building and his tenure would end on April 30th, 1949 if Mr. Jones was agreeable.\n\nAfter the quarters which had been prepared for the Principal's residence were badly damaged by fire, it was suggested that if building No. 22 could be obtained in time for alterations that the damaged building need not be repaired for Mr. Scrase.\n\nI would suggest if this has not clarified the matter that you discuss the situation with either Mr. Neary or Mr. C.A.F. Clark, as they both have a thorough knowledge of the set-up at Ex-122.

(RG 10, Volume 6317, file 656-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nAttention: Col. Neary.\n\nWith reference to Army Message dated May 23rd and my reply dated May 24th in connection with the situation at the Lac La Ronge School in Prince Albert. I quote the Department's Army Message exactly as it arrived in my office.\n\n\"Canon Cook disturb threats resignation stop\nLac La Ronge School Prince Albert stop can you report\non additional alterations and equipment required stop\nfunds available now but may not be in July as no indication supplementary estimates stop has Jones reports\nPrincipals residence as requested official letter\nMay 10.\"\n\nIt will be seen that the wording of this Army Message as it reached me made it very difficult to understand. In the first place I had not received a copy of official letter of May 10th presumed to have been sent to Mr. Jones. Now, upon enquiry and examination of the files in the office of the Carlton Agency, I find that Mr. Jones has not received a letter from the Department dated May 10th in connection with the Lac La Ronge School. Therefore, I am assuming that the Army Message refers to Department letter of May 11th which relates to matters regarding the Lac La Ronge School and in particular to living quarters for the Principal.\n\nI telephoned from Prince Albert to Mr. Scovill in my office at Regina and was informed that the confirmation of the Army Message changed it only to the extent that the word \"stop\" following the word \"resignation\" should be \"staff\".\nSome of the staff at the Lac La Ronge School have been threatening to resign at different times for months. I can only repeat what has been stated in a letter Mr. Jones addressed to the Department recently, the resignation of some of these would result in no serious loss to the Lac La Ronge School.\n\nPart of the cause of dissatisfaction among the staff recently has been the result of an order from the Fire Chief for the city of Prince Albert, that certain electrical equipment must not be used in some of the buildings, where the wiring is not suited for the use of such equipment. We have had one serious fire in these buildings which resulted in the loss of the building intended for the Principal's residence and it was found that the cause was due to faulty wiring. There have been other threatened fires in some of the buildings for the same reason. It is my opinion that the order with regard to the use of electrical equipment in these buildings should be strictly followed.\n\nOn examination of building No. 22 today, which is the first opportunity I have had to examine that particular building, I found that it was wired with conduit in accordance with the requirements of Prince Albert City regulations, therefore, safe to use with all kinds of electrical equipment. I would now recommend that Building No. 21 be re-wired with conduit to conform with city regulations, as different kinds of electrical equipment should be used in that particular building, in view of the fact that it is used for the purpose of an infirmary, and the wiring must be as safe as possible. A requisition in this connection will be submitted by Mr. Jones as soon as he obtains a quotation thereon.\n\nAgain referring to Building No. 22. This building has actually returned to the control of the Department of Public Works and very soon will be available for the use of the Lac La Ronge Residential School for school purposes. With this in mind, Rev. Scrase, Mr. Jones and I examined the building today with a view to preparing it for use. I have arranged with Mr. Norman Thompson, Regional Architect, Department of Public Works, Saskatoon, to have a blue print prepared regarding necessary changes in this building for school purposes. When Mr. Jones has received the blue print, he will submit a requisition and quotations to the Department at once to carry out the proposed alterations in that building.\nWhen the alterations have been completed in Building No. 22, it will provide room for the following: Chapel, four fairly large rooms for single members of the staff, one two-roomed suite which will be used by the Matron as a bedroom and living room and office combined, three three-roomed suites for married members of the school staff, also a staff sitting room.\n\nSome of the dissatisfaction of the staff results from the fact that the classroom teachers have been given very small private rooms in the dormitories and they feel that this is not satisfactory to them. They say that having spent the day in the classroom with the children, they should not have to assume responsibility for their care in the dormitories through the night. I am inclined to agree, however, I certainly think we should insist upon one member of the staff, not a teacher, sleeping in a private room connected with the dormitories for obvious reasons.\n\nIt is to be hoped that the necessary formalities may be completed at this end in order to make use of the funds now available by the end of June and we are all acting with that in view.\n\nThe matter which has been the cause of the greatest controversy in connection with the Lac La Ronge School has been the living quarters for the Principal. I believe Rev. Scrase is doing and will do excellent work in connection with the management of the Lac La Ronge School. For that reason I would like to see him settled with suitable living quarters separate from all other buildings. Therefore, I would recommend that Building No. 2 be made suitable for a Principal's residence. This Building was turned over to our Department some time ago and from time to time consideration has been given to the best means of putting it to use. I have now concluded that it is the building which should be prepared for the principal's residence. I have discussed this with Mr. Jones and Mr. Scrase and they both agree. The cost of putting this building in good shape for the Principal's residence would probably be as much as $4,000.00, which I do not consider too high a price to pay for a suitable residence for a Principal of a residential School.\n\nWhen the architect visits Prince Albert this week in connection with the other matters at the Lac La Ronge School, he is being asked to prepare plans for renovating Building No. 2.\nMr. Jones will then take the necessary action to prepare a requisition and obtain quotations toward that end, submitting them to the Department at the earliest possible date in the hope that the work can be carried out within the month of June.\n\nI may say in connection with these proposals that I am well aware that we will have difficulties in carrying out all of the proposals by the end of June, after which I understand there may not be funds available for the purpose. However, I trust that, if it is found impossible to have the work completed within the required time, a further appropriation may be secured.\n\nI wish to say definitely at this time, that the situation with regard to Lac La Ronge School and the future thereof, is not as disturbing as the Department has been led to believe. All matters are gradually coming under the control of those chiefly concerned, Rev. Scrase and Mr. Jones. I have never had any doubt as to the ability of Mr. Jones to carry out the necessary work in this connection, if he is given the required authority and support. After meeting Rev. Scrase today, I am prepared to say that I have little doubt as to the ability of Rev. Scrase to do his share towards that end.\n\nJ. P. B.

As a result of this investigation and discussion Mr. Ostrander recommended as follows:\n\n(a) That building #2, one of the old R.C.M.P. houses, be fixed up as the Principal's Residence.\n\n(b) That Hut #22 be fixed up to include Chapel, matron's quarters, staff sitting room, three suites for married personnel and six single rooms for staff members.\n\n(c) That the Hospital building be re-wired and battleship linoleum put on the floors.\n\nMr. Ostrander has had a draftsman in Prince Albert taking measurements for plans covering the above and it is understood that, as soon as these plans are ready, contractors will be invited to bid on the work.\n\nIn view of the fact, as advised your Branch previously on several occasions, that we are experiencing great difficulty in retaining staff at this School because of the lack of proper or suitable staff accommodation, it will be appreciated if you will give favourable consideration to the work as soon as possible after you receive the tenders. You will agree, I am certain, that in the circumstances it is of the highest importance that this work be completed at an early date and particularly before the staff re-assemble for the fall term.\n\nGeneral Turner is leaving for Prince Albert on Monday next, 20th June, and I should be glad of an opportunity to discuss this matter with you\n\n(P.T.O)\n\nIndian Affairs.

He feels, and in this I agree, that this would bring the Indian boys into closer acquaintanceship with the white boys in the city to the benefit of all concerned.\n\nIn order to operate this team and provide equipment for other boys at the School to participate in hockey the minimum requirements are as follows:\n\n- 24 hockey sticks,\n- 6 pucks,\n- 18 pairs shoes and skates,\n- 2 sets goalies pads, protectors and gauntlets.\n\nIt is appreciated that normally you do not supply such sports equipment but, in view of the beneficial advantages of a closer acquaintance and co-operation between the pupils and the white population could be effected through the medium of hockey, perhaps you would be prepared to assist us in the supplying of the necessary equipment. It would be appreciated, therefore, if you will advise us, as early as possible, what you can do in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHenry G. Cook,\nSuperintendent.\nColonel B. F.

Cook,\nSuperintendent.\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe: Root House - All Saints' (Iac la Ronge)\nIndian Residential School, Prince Albert.\n\nAt the above School four acres of ground have been planted in potatoes and a fair amount sown in turnips, carrots, beets, etc.\n\nIt is essential, therefore, that a suitable Root House be provided at this School before the coming autumn because otherwise the crop of vegetables will be lost through freezing when the cold weather sets in.\n\nMr. Jones, your local Superintendent, advised me during my recent visit to Prince Albert that he was obtaining up-to-date plans on the Root House from the University of Saskatchewan and that as soon as he receives these plans he proposes to send them to you with a request for authority to invite tenders.\n\nIn view of the extreme urgency of this service it is requested that authority to invite tenders be granted as early as possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHenry G.

This particular individual has now left our employ and, naturally, has taken his tools with him with the result that practically no tools whatsoever are available at the School.\n\nAs this is a newly established school it is presumed that you are prepared to supply the necessary tools under the provision of your \"Formula\" dated 21st June, 1948 (your file 150-97). I understand that Mr. Jones, your local Superintendent, is submitting a requisition for the tools required for maintenance at this School and it would be appreciated if this can be approved at an early date so that minor repairs, etc. may be carried out by the school staff.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHenry G.

So far as the weather period is concerned this Administration is prepared to provide the necessary heating so that the building may be used for the benefit of the pupils.\n\nAt the present time it is impossible to use this Drill Hall for recreation, etc. because of a considerable quantity of stores belonging to your Department that are now stacked on the main floor. I was given to understand, however, that your Mr. Clark is recommending that the lumber, which forms the greater part of these stores, be sold or otherwise disposed of. It would be appreciated if you can make arrangements to have the equipment, supplies, etc., now stacked on the main floor of this Drill Hall cleared out during the summer so that this building may be available for recreational, etc. activities of the pupils from the commencement of the next school term.\n\nI was informed by your Mr. Jones that he is much in favour of this Drill Hall being made available for activities of pupils as outlined above.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHenry G.

You will note that there is a considerable difference between the amount which we have arrived at and the amount which you state Cassidy's request. This is possibly due to the fact that the firm did not supply all the items on the Purchase Order.\nPlease forward a voucher for their account so that we can again take up the matter with the Purchasing Branch.

I stated that it would be appreciated, if in these circumstances, you could give us some financial assistance towards the expenditure involved.\n\nSubsequently Mr. Phelan asked us to obtain a receipted account covering Mr. Mayo's expenditure. We have managed, after considerable correspondence, to obtain this from the Empress Hotel, Prince Albert, in the amount of $603.81 and this receipted account is forwarded you herewith.\n\nAs mentioned in my letter of 30th April, we shall appreciate anything you can do towards reimbursing us in whole or in part for this expenditure.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nHenry G.

We are desirous of meeting the wishes of the M.S.C.C. in this particular regard, but we do not wish to incur any heavy expenditure.\n\nPlease let us have your suggestions with regard to what can be done. Your immediate attention to the matter would be appreciated, as if it is decided to build a root house, the erection of it should commence very soon.\n\nBernard F.

Cook, Superintendent of the M.S.C.C., writes as follows regarding the drill hall at the Lac la Ronge Residential School:\n\n\"The Drill Hall at the above School is admirably suited for recreation and other activities of the pupils during wet weather in the Autumn and Spring and during the winter months. So far as the weather period is concerned this Administration is prepared to provide the necessary heating so that the building may be used for the benefit of the pupils.\n\nAt the present time it is impossible to use this Drill Hall for recreation, etc., because of a considerable quantity of stores belonging to your Department that are now stacked on the main floor. I was given to understand, however, that your Mr. Clark is recommending that the lumber, which forms the greater part of these stores, be sold or otherwise disposed of. It would be appreciated if you can make arrangements to have the equipment, supplies, etc., now stacked on the main floor of this Drill Hall cleared out during the summer so that this building may be available for recreational, etc., activities of the pupils from the commencement of the next school term.\"\n\nThe Department feels that the above request is reasonable, and we would like to know from you.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This particular individual has now left our employ and, naturally, has taken his tools with him with the result that practically no tools whatsoever are available at the school.\"\n\nThe Department is prepared to supply a reasonable quantity of tools for the Engineer's use, and you should forward a requisition for the items which you consider should be supplied.\n\nBernard F.

As you will appreciate, while the opinion or views of such employees are acceptable from the standpoint of the actual set-up of the machinery and of the mechanical condition of the equipment, their views on its location are of no value because they have no knowledge of the factors affecting the overall operation and administration of the School.\n\nSo far as we are aware here, the laundry machinery itself and the actual layout of the machinery are satisfactory but, as you know, we have consistently maintained from the time this School was opened that the laundry should be located in the Drill Hall in proximity to our storerooms, and sewing and mending rooms. The constant carrying of the soiled clothes to the laundry and of the washed articles back to the Drill Hall involves a great amount of unnecessary labour and loss of time.\n\nIt will be appreciated, therefore, if you will proceed with the moving of the laundry to the Drill Hall in accordance with the agreement reached in your office on 20th June, 1949, and the instructions which we understand you already have given to Mr. Jones, your local Superintendent.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nHenry G.

This morning we located your letter.\n\nWe are prepared to purchase a reasonable amount of equipment for the engineer, but purchase will have to be made through our Purchasing Branch. The information given on the attached requisition is not sufficiently definite for us to do so.\n\nFor instance, in the case of screw drivers there is a request for small, medium and large. We should know the lengths of the screw drivers required. Definite information should also be supplied regarding the cross cut saw, planes, chisels, resetting tool for taps and wrench.\n\nPlease have the Principal supply the information we require, quoting catalogue numbers. As soon as we receive a reply to this letter we will arrange with the Departmental Purchasing Agent to secure the tools.\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6317, file 656-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Canon Cook,\n\nLaundry at Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School\n\nReference to your letter of July 22nd.\n\nThe removal of the laundry to the drill hall will require, I am informed, some changes in the use to which the drill hall is presently being subjected, together with the restoration of certain facilities and the addition of others.\n\nThe original plan anticipated the use of sufficient floor space to allow for:\n(1) A machine laundry installed according to acceptable commercial standards,\n(2) Home laundry facilities of the type found in Indian homes.\n\nThe purposes of these installations were:\n(1) To provide the proper pattern and procedure for girls to train for commercial laundry work,\n(2) To reduce the time spent in institutional chores,\n(3) To give practice in household laundry methods looking to the improvement of household practice.\n\nUnfortunately these ideals seem to have been forgotten and the floor space available for laundry work was reduced to 26'6\" x 22' 8\". This space could be enlarged if the room taken up by the storage of the school truck and automobiles were made available for the purpose originally intended. I understand that a garage building may become available.\n\nThrough lack of appreciation of the diverse uses to which the building was suited the group of toilets was removed, leaving no sanitary conveniences for the boys and girls who it was anticipated would be present in the building for recreational and vocational training. These facilities should be restored and their restoration would further reduce the floor space presently available for laundry purposes.\n\nThe heating units required for the laundry necessitate the installation of a chimney acceptable to the Prince Albert fire inspector. A hot water tank should also be added. The siting of these two additions is further inconvenienced by the presence of the vehicles and the machine shop.\n\nConvenient passage doors and adequate lighting and ventilation of this low-ceilinged lean-to are considerations of primary importance. The health of adult and student workers in some cramped installations is said to have suffered. I am assured that a transfer of the machinery from its present site (where all the foregoing considerations have received expert consideration) to the limited area that has lately been suggested would arouse more adverse comment from more people than does the present procedure of transporting clothes to and from the machinery. Moreover, in the building...\nwhere the machinery is presently installed there is ample covered space for the airing and drying of clothes. This is not the case in the drill hall which has been used for the storage of coal.\n\nIt would seem, therefore, that a preliminary step to the transfer of the laundry machinery would be to house the vehicles and the machine-shop elsewhere and to restore sanitary conveniences to the drill hall.\n\n[Signature]\n29/8/47\n| DATE   | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| June 30 | To nuts and bolts purchased for repairing heating system, All Saints Indian Residential School as per account attached hereto. | .99    |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

It is noted that you recommend that the laundry machinery be transferred from its present location to the drill hall.\n\nIt is our understanding that at the present time the drill hall is used for storage of the school truck and automobiles. We also understand that the toilets which were originally located in this building were removed. It would also be necessary to install a new chimney and a hot water tank. Considerable cleaning would also be necessary in this building, as part of it has been used for the storage of coal.\n\nFrom the information contained in the letter from Mr. Busby, it was evident that the new laundry machinery has been properly installed and presumably is giving satisfactory service. To remove it to another building will involve considerable expense, and there is a possibility that the new location would also have certain disadvantages. It appears to us that the present method of transferring the clothes to and from the building where the laundry machinery is located should not present any unsurmountable difficulties.\n\nTaking the above into consideration, we believe that the laundry machinery should remain in the present building.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6317, file 656-5, part 10)\nAIR MAIL\n\nAugust 5th, 1949.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n304 Post Office Building,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\n\nRe: Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School\n\nThe Superintendent of the M.S.C.C. has been urging us to transfer the laundry from its present location to the drill hall. Mr. Clark, who visited the school, has reported to us that to place the laundry machinery in the drill hall would involve considerable work in the latter building, and the removal of a great deal of material which is now stored there.\n\nFrom the report made by Mr. Busby of Stanley Brock Limited, we inferred that the machinery is properly set up at the present time, and to remove it to another building would not only involve considerable expense, but might result in some damage to the machinery.\n\nAttached for your information is a copy of a letter which we propose to send to Canon Cook. Please let me have your comments as soon as possible.\n\nBernard F.

I was informed, quite definitely, by Mr. Jones that the laundry was placed in its present location during his absence, after all arrangements had been made to have it installed in the drill hall building, and that the change was made at the request of the Church officials. In view of this fact, I certainly think that it should remain where it is until they can satisfy us that its present location is unsuitable and are willing to pay at least a part of the cost of changing the location.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nAugust 31st, 1949.\n\nRev. Canon H.Q. Cook, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nThe Indian School Administration,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nRe: Lac la Ronge Indian Residential School\n\nWe received your letter of July 22nd in connection with the laundry at the above school. We communicated with Regional Supervisor Ostrander. In your letter you recommended that the laundry machinery be transferred from its present location to the drill hall.\n\nIt is our understanding that at the present time the drill hall is used for storage of the school truck and automobiles. We also understand that the toilets which were originally located in this building were removed. It would also be necessary to install a new chimney and a hot water tank. Considerable cleaning would also be necessary in this building, as part of it has been used for the storage of coal.\n\nFrom the information contained in the letter from Mr. Busby, it was evident that the new laundry machinery has been properly installed and presumably is giving satisfactory service.\nTo remove it to another building will involve considerable expense, and there is a possibility that the new location would also have certain disadvantages. It appears to us that the present method of transferring the clothes to and from the building where the laundry machinery is located should not present any unsurmountable difficulties.\n\nTaking the above into consideration, we believe that the laundry machinery should remain in the present building.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nPP/ST Supt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nReference letter 656-5 (E.1) of July 18, 1949, re lumber in storage, Lac La Ronge residential school.\n\nWe have at present a quantity of lumber stored in the drill hall.\n\nMr. Namage, Department of Public Works has authorized the use of the Public Works storage building, situated in the old Army Camp grounds, in which to store this lumber. Transfer will be made as soon as the services of a trucker can be made.\n\nWhen the lumber is moved there will then be ample space in the drill hall for recreational purposes.\n\nThere was 4000 ft. of lumber at the start but some has been used and this should be as lumber is now cheaper.\n\nE. J. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\n\nESJ/AG\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nReference is made to Departmental letter 656-5 (E.I) dated July 18, 1949, regarding root-house for the Lac La Ronge Residential School.\n\nI am of the opinion a root house should be supplied. With this in mind, plans were obtained from the University of Saskatchewan for building a Bank Root House. It was found the cost of this would be around three thousand dollars.\n\nI then called in a contractor with a view to obtaining prices on constructing a suitable structure 18' x 28' along the lines outlined in plans from the University which included use of rock-wool insulation in one end of the cement lean-to of the drill hall. The estimated cost amounted to over two thousand dollars.\n\nFinally, I discussed the matter with Mr. J. Ramage of the Department of Public Works, and a contractor as to the feasibility of putting a structure in the building outlined above, packing with shavings and banking the outside wall with earth. Mr. Ramage is definitely of the opinion this would prove suitable and estimated the cost at $800.00. This figure does not include the cost of six thousand feet of lumber required. We have suitable lumber stored in the drill hall which can be used, if approval is given.\n\nSuggest we ask what this year's harvest has amounted to and where it is to be stored. Can we also ask a root-house to be included in estimates?\nMay we please be advised.\n\nE. S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\n\nESJ/AG\nAugust 31, 1949\n\nRev. Canon H.G.

The school has been in operation since June, 1948, in the location just mentioned. It is operated under the auspices of the M.S.C.C. and Canon Cook has brought to our attention on several occasions the necessity of providing a proper teachers' residence, also a separate building for other members of the school staff.\n\nIt is reported that building No. 2 at the camp could be used for a principal's residence and building No. 22, for other members of the staff. Both these buildings will require renovation in order to be suitable.\n\nWith the assistance of Mr. J. Ramage, District Resident Architect of the Public Works Department, of Saskatoon, detailed information has been prepared regarding the repairs required to both buildings. Following this, Mr. Regional Supervisor Ostrander has endeavoured to secure tenders on the work required. He forwarded the following quotations from Harvey Lunam Construction Company, General Contractor, Regina, Sask., for the repairs required according to plans and specifications:\n\nBuilding No. 2 ............. $6,293.00\nBuilding No. 22 (Repairs) $5,624.00\nSeparate quotation for painting building No. 22 .... 1,650.00 7,274.00\n\nOn receipt of these prices Mr. Ostrander submitted them to Mr.\nRamage, who states that he considers the prices quoted by the above contractor are exceptionally reasonable.

With that in mind, I endeavoured to obtain prices and plans throughout the summer, but was unable to obtain services of anyone sufficiently interested to prepare them until quite recently.\n\nI am forwarding same on in the hope consideration can still be given to having this work carried out as soon as possible.\n\nSgd.

The management has been successful in raising a very large amount of vegetables and potatoes during the past summer, and a proper root house is necessary to store them.\n\nThe Harvey Lunam Construction Company, who are now doing other work at this school, have submitted a tender in an amount of $985.00 for the erection of a root house.

The hot water jackets were replaced during my absence in the North.\n\nThe delay in my reply is due to the fact that Mr. Waterhouse left the employ of the Church Authorities after the water jackets were replaced. I held up the accounts hoping to learn of Mr. Waterhouse' whereabouts. I did not hear, consequently, the accounts went forward to the Department. He now writes as follows:\n\n\"Four of the water jackets had not been in use for some time. Two that were in use leaked so badly that two buildings were left without hot water when heat and pressure was applied. The remaining four also leaked rendering them useless. The water jackets originally installed were of the iron type, the new ones are malleable, it is claimed they have double the life.\"\n\nPrevious to having trouble with the water jackets, replacements had amounted to valves, elbows, connections etc. The above was not anticipated and it was unfortunate the replacements became necessary during my absence. Had I been on hand, authority would have been obtained before proceeding.\nRegarding Voucher 664 (107) in favour of the Northern Hardware, as previously explained, this firm's book-keeping was in a terrible mess.

The management has been successful in raising a very large amount of vegetables and potatoes during the past summer, and a proper root house is necessary to store them.\n\nThe Harvey Lunam Construction Company, who are now doing other work at this school, have submitted a tender in an amount of $985.00 for the erection of a root house. Superintendent Jones considers the amount reasonable, and as it is advisable to have the vegetables and potatoes properly stored to be used for food purposes during the winter, I would appreciate it if you would approve acceptance of the tender of the Harvey Lunam Construction Company in the amount stated above.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\nNovember 22, 1949.\n\nMr. E.S.

No authority was issued for this expenditure and on receipt of the voucher we wrote Superintendent Jones and I enclose for your information a copy of his reply.

Jones, Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nIn connection with building #2 which is being converted into a residence for the Principal, Supt. Jones stated that some difficulty had been encountered in view of the fact that when they attempted to dig the basement a spring was struck.\n\nMr. Ramage, architect of the Public Works Department, also spoke to me about the matter and his suggestion was that the basement should only be placed under part of the building and the rest of the building should be strengthened by using some extra lumber that is on hand and the result would be that the Principal's residence would be a bungalow. This appears to meet with the approval of all parties concerned and Mr. Ramage was very insistent that it was the best possible move that could be made at the present time and would result in our having a suitable residence for the Principal. The extra expenditure involved to carry out Mr. Ramage's suggestion would be $1,000. Mr. Ramage further stated that he would be in the vicinity of Prince Albert within the next few weeks in view of the fact that a new Post Office is being constructed in that town and he would give the work his personal supervision without cost to the Department.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nNovember 24th, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMAJOR D.M.

Superintendent Jones telephoned us and stated that when the contractor attempted to dig the basement under this building, a spring was struck.\n\nMr. Jones consulted Mr. Ramage, Architect of the Public Works Department at Prince Albert. Both Mr. Jones and Mr. Ramage spoke to us over the telephone, and Mr. Ramage stated that as a result of striking the spring, it was not possible to place a basement under the whole of the building. His suggestion was that a basement should be placed under a part of the building, and the balance of the building should be strengthened by using extra lumber on hand. This would result in converting the building into a bungalow, which would meet with the approval of all parties concerned.\n\nMr. Ramage was very insistent on the fact that the suggestion just mentioned was the best possible move that could be made at the present time, and would result in providing a suitable residence for the Principal.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6317, file 656-5, part II)\nTo carry out Mr. Ramage's suggestion would involve an extra expenditure of $1,000.00, and we would appreciate it if you would approve this expenditure in order that we may notify the contractor to proceed with the work. Funds for the purpose are provided in our current year's appropriation.\n\nI may add that Mr. Ramage has been of considerable assistance both to Mr. Ostrander and Superintendent Jones in connection with our building, and when telephoning us the other day he stated that he would be in the vicinity of Prince Albert within the next few weeks in view of the fact that a new Post Office is being constructed in that town, and he would give the work his personal supervision without cost to the Department.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nThe Indian School Administration\nof the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO THE SUPERINTENDENT\nREV.

The hot water jackets were replaced during my absence in the North.\n\nThe delay in my reply is due to the fact that Mr. Waterhouse left the employ of the Church authorities after the water jackets were replaced. I held up the accounts hoping to learn of Mr. Waterhouse' whereabouts. I did not hear, consequently, the accounts went forward to the Department. He now writes as follows:\n\n\"Four of the water jackets had not been in use for some time. Two that were in use leaked so badly that two buildings were left without hot water when heat and pressure were applied. The remaining four also leaked rendering them useless. The water jackets originally installed were of the iron type, the new ones are malleable, it is claimed they have double the life.\"\n\nPrevious to having trouble with the water jackets, replacements had amounted to valves, elbows, connections etc. The above was not anticipated and it was unfortunate the replacements became necessary during my absence. Had I been on hand, authority would have been obtained before proceeding.\n\nRegarding voucher 664 (107) in favour of the Northern Hardware, as previously explained, this firm's bookkeeping was in a terrible mess. We could not get them to render accounts. This particular account extended over 1948 and into 1949.\n\n(Sgd) E.S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nNovember 22, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nAttached is an account amounting to $540, covering the cost of hot water jackets installed in the dormitories at the Lac la Ronge Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware this school is being operated in a former Army Camp near Prince Albert Saskatchewan. No authority was issued for this expenditure and on receipt of the voucher we wrote Superintendent Jones and I enclose for your information a copy of his reply. There is no doubt that the equipment was required and it is hoped that you will be able to issue a Purchase Order so that the account may be paid.\n\nWe are unable to locate voucher No. 664 (107) to which the Superintendent also refers.
