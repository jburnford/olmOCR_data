While the institution, being of Canadian New World origin, has grown, has a certain interest for the people at large, the progressive prosperity indicated in the report gives evidence of careful and efficient management that must be highly gratifying and satisfactory to those more immediately concerned.\n\nLOCAL GOVERNMENT.\nThis is not a new subject. It has been ventilated often enough during the past year, but as soon as the Cabinet Ministers have recently been interviewed by Northwest members regarding the granting of a local Government and, more particularly, as Mr. Davis, the member for West Assiniboia, proposes a bill for the purpose of its object, the formation of the whole Territories into one Province, it is as well the community should keep themselves posted in regard to the matter. The Cabinet is asked to give some definite form of Government, but no feasible scheme has yet been matured. We do not at all expect the proposals of those parties who have had active consideration of such organization of the Territories into a single province will at present be favorably entertained by the Government. No doubt the time must come when provision will be accommodated to and correspondingly amenable assumed by the Territories, but for the present we think it is decidedly premature to ask that the Territories should immediately be put into the position of a Province. If such a course is not yet sufficiently settled, it is not populous and wealthy enough; it is in fact too young to take this important step all at once.\n\nThe days of the Northwest Council are past; present footing are not based. It requires a great deal of reconstruction\u2014but we presume it is capable of such\u2014and with enlarged powers and a more equal representation, it may serve the country's turn for a short time yet. In the past it has done some good work, and even its opponents would not argue it has been of any very dangerous aspect and that the future may be better for a little rather to endure the ills we have, than fly to others that we know not of.\n\nWe are aware a section of the population is impatiently waiting for the Territorial quite ready for Provincial Government now. It may be that some residents of the Saskatchewan district think so, but are there any in that district who think the immediate formation of what will constitute a single Province, with headquarters at Regina, is likely to be a great improvement on the present state of matters? The country is too large to be advantageously divided into this manner.\n\nThe great District of Saskatchewan will, as soon as railway facilities are available, make rapid progress we believe than any portion of the Territories, and will stand out as a nation at no very distant date, aim at a life of its own. When the Hon. Thomas White was here in 1886, the address presented to him by the people suggested to him that he say \"bye\" to the future, and that the Territories should be formed into Provinces, with Legislative Assemblies having the same powers as the Local Legislatures of the older Provinces, and that the Provincial Saskatchewan be so constituted as to have a common boundary on Hudson's Bay.\n\nThe time is not yet, but let these suggestions to Mr. White be kept in view, and in the meantime we may get along possibly well either under the present regime or some improved arrangement, until we are fully prepared to manage our own affairs.\n\nANNUAL MEETING.\nThe annual meeting of the shareholders of the Commercial Bank of Manitoba was held at the banking house, Winnipeg, on Thursday, 25th May.\n\nBelow is the general statement of the liabilities and assets:\n\nLIABILITIES\nNotes in circulation $24,000.00\nDue to other banks in Canada $10,000.00\nDue to other banks outside Canada $10,000.00\nTotal liabilities to the public $54,000.00\nLess cash in bank account $5,000.00\nLess cash in trust account $2,000.00\nLess cash in deposit and loan account $2,000.00\nTotal liabilities $47,000.00\n\nASSETS\nGold and silver coin on hand $5,000.00\nBank notes on hand $5,000.00\nDiscounts due from other banks $10,000.00\nDiscounts due from other banks $10,000.00\nTotal assets immediately available $30,000.00\nLoans and discounted bills $10,000.00\nLess cash in bank account $2,000.00\nLess cash in trust account $2,000.00\nLess cash in deposit and loan account $2,000.00\nSales and other office furniture $1,000.00\nTotal assets $25,000.00\n\nPRESIDENT'S ADDRESS.\nIn moving the adoption of the report the President delivered the following address:\n\nTo the Shareholders of the Commercial Bank of Manitoba.\n\nGentlemen:\u2014The Board of Directors of the Commercial Bank have much pleasure in submitting their annual report. It is with this occasion that the Bank is met with a large measure of success during the second year of existence. The public confidence has been steadily growing throughout the Province, have continued to give an increasing measure of support, and the Bank has been able to increase its number of accounts, and are doing, both in point of volume and amount, a very creditable business. Due to the decreased state of the country for the last few years, great caution has had to be exercised in extending the credit, and in connection the operations of the bank generally, and the Bank in consequence has been lossless during the past year.\n\nAny questions. The directors feel that this caution must continue until such time as prospects of the country are placed on a basis of stability upon which they are glad to believe is now not far distant.\n\nAt the time of our last annual meeting the paid up capital stock of the bank was, in round numbers, $200,000. It now stands at $270,000, an increase of $70,000, and will shortly be increased to $300,000, after which time it is not intended to call up more stock for some time, as it is believed that the amount already subscribed will meet all the requirements of the business probably for a long time to come. This is a good sign, as it has been the desire of the Directors to place as much stock as possible in the hands of the proprietors, and the result has been disappointing. They are well satisfied with the amount of stock held by the people of this country, and I may say that we have had frequent applications from England, and that the proprietors are anxious for such matters, such as the expansion of legitimate business, which would necessitate the use of more capital, we can place any portion of the balance of our unappropriated capital stock there.\n\nAt our last meeting we placed $10,000 in the hands of the proprietors in a trust account, with the view of forming the nucleus of a rest, which is in our opinion rapidly growing. However, I am convinced that we shall have also our paying a dividend at the rate of 7 per cent on the capital and all charges, place the balance of $40,000 this year in a trust account. These amounts we have transferred to \"trust account,\" which commenced at the beginning of the year.\n\nIt is a matter of much satisfaction that the season has, so far this year, been auspicious, and the crops larger than ever before, and when harvest ends in the Province, and the united and systematic efforts that will shortly be made to bring the surplus to market, especially to the vicinity of Winnipeg, will, I believe, be crowned with signal success. I shall therefore, and I am sure that the proprietors will, say without conclusion that no better opportunity exists for the Directors of this Bank to bring the greatest to conduct their business in the safest and most profitable way in their power, and now in conclusion I would move that the report be adopted as aforesaid, and be, and the same is hereby adopted and ordered to be printed for distribution amongst the proprietors.\n\nMr. J. R. McKinnon seconded the adoption of the report, which was unanimously carried.\n\nThe following gentlemen were then elected directors for the ensuing year: Duncan Macdonald, Esq., Hon. C. E. Smith, Hon. H. H. Sutherland, Alexander Lumsden, R. T. Robb.\n\nMr. L.

With a ready market, surely, would be afforded the district, if the farmers purchased the purchase of this lot of short dirty bushels, feebly recommended by the committee?\n\nWould it not be advisable for the seed grain committee to transform their proposed hospital to a public asylum for the insane? Would the recommendation of the Lorne Agricultural Society?\n\nBut there is another grievance. Here it is:\u2014\n\n\"They also regretted the amount of foreign seed they had sold, partly, while they have got to understand there is a market for seed and barns left here in the district, there is no market at home.\"\n\nMy only serious objection to this paragraph is that it is not true. I challenge the seed grain committee to furnish the names of a single farmer who was refused seed by me, or who was refused seed which he had or was likely to have the land in condition for sowing.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJOHN MCGREGOR,\nAgent Dominion Lands,\nPrince Albert, June 8, 1887.\n\nO'BRIEN'S VISIT.\n\nIn speaking of Mr. O'Brien's visit, the Toronto Herald wrote: \"We cannot afford to feel much regret at the mishap of Mr. O'Brien. Boldly conduct is always to be deplored, and we are disposed to regard the example of rashly conduct to his advantage. We have heard of his conduct from one end of Canada to the other. He would not have done that in the way he has done, if he had been in the hands of Mr. Torontor, but this method is simply than the wilful lies and slanderers that lie, looking for the fall of the man they hate. Mr. O'Brien is one of those men that can form no lieless less material than a shock to himself, and we believe he has received one. We do not for a moment excuse his associates, but, while condemning their methods, we consider that they have been more than fairly dealt with. And, moreover, it will serve the party's purpose to think so far as the effect of the lie is concerned. The people about this fresh agitation as nothing but a plot can. Mr. O'Brien was allowed to go abroad, and Mr. Macdonald, in general simply ignored him, leaving the hands of the Irish, and a single man, to make a scene at the annual meetings, or in any way countenanced his attempt to stir up trouble, with the exception of a single Irish organiser, Mr. O'Brien, who, because his attempted mischief making was thus tolerated and tolerated, thought strong enough to send a telegraph to his friends here that \"O'Brien is safe,\" and that his conduct would have been reported as \"wild.\" As to the Loyalist meeting in Queen's Park, Mr. O'Brien was present, and the prominent importance that the true feeling in Canada about this agitation had been shown by the attendance of the people, is the great service that will have been done by the Loyalist meeting, however strange though strange enough to hear, that Mr. O'Brien should be absent from that rough \"send off\" by way of emphatic salutation. Mr. O'Brien, however, told the agitators to go away and talk about the country as to the attack on him. \"Bring back by Mr. Landseer (not Landseer) under Lord Lansdowne's window,\" we have a specimen of the ridiculous lies that would have filled out the account of his reception in England, if this had not been accompanied by several unmistakable counter demonstrations. But the brickbats that flew about his head dissipated his last chance of making out Ontario as well as Quebec, to be sure, but he could not have been told in abstract principles, that Mr. O'Brien was no more likely to succeed in his law suit than he was likely to succeed in his political enterprise. The inhabitants of Mr. O'Brien's district, however, were not the people of Toronto in this case, but the people of a few dozens dismally poor men, who, for a few minutes, got beyond the control of fear and went about the streets and fields in spots. And when a man every day of his life breaking the law, he cannot be expected to break the law. The owner of the hall he engaged trying to pull down should fall into himself. Mr. O'Brien's conduct is simply that of a man who has laws he can disobey when he catches a shift of the whirlwind he has by trying to break them.\n\nIn conclusion, Mr. O'Brien has received rough treatment; which is regrettable, but not surprising. If he per se had been treated as a man who had been branded among infamable tow, the natural consequences must ensue\u2014it looks like a case of the old \"whip the dog for three consequences.\" Unquestionably his errand to Canada was to raise a disturbance, and his failure in raising the cry of Canada is not likely that when he returns to Ireland he will be regarded as a Canadian hero. We suppose that we are all Parnellites. He must have intended to make a sensation, and he did. His name was a weapon of war, the cannon against the Governor-General; and unless in some small degree he may have been forced to retreat, he must have been opposed, and perhaps violently opposed, by every one who had at least sense of fair play and decency.\n\nWhy did not the Government, anticipating this, save Canada from being turned into a battlefield of Irish factiousness? Why should loyal Canadians be offended by the scandalous talk of this mercenary agitator? The only evil that now affects Ireland is the fact that it is now so bad, it is too bad the dissolution it is threatened to bring about in Ireland should be permitted in Canada. The Irish free speech among respectable citizens must be kept sacred, and the Irish at St. Vincent de Paul to go about the country preaching robbery treason and murder.\n\nCALGARY.\n\nFrom the Calgary, May 27.\n\nThe promised snow has heightened right expectations, and still there is more to follow.\n\nThe stock inspector who was sent up from the Manitoba Stock Association, was here yesterday afternoon, and will remain along the line.\n\nAlthough the stock bridge has been completed, the contractors have not yet started to cross it on account of the work not having yet been accepted. Mr. Cayley, who was here yesterday afternoon, stated that the inspectors would be obliged to say stating the facts to him, and asking that the inspectors might be in order to prevent the crossing of the stock, there will be no unnecessary delay.\n\nA stock yard block has been bought last night for $500, and will be used for the storage of Pollard Angus bullocks, the first that have yet been imported, yet 300 heads of sheep will be landed today, and 400 tomorrow, some very promising animals. The same number of sheep will be shipped tomorrow, and all the dysentery cases here will not look out. The lot are at Fowl's stable.\n\nA good many of the Turf Club are in favor of having a big midsummer meet going on here track on July 1st. There are plenty of races that can be run, provided it is sufficiently advertised to bring horses from outside places. Several of the members have assured me of their willingness to bring their horses here and so they should be led in dealing with the question. Mr. Macdonald should advocate likewise for a good programme, and there is no reason why the race track should remain idle for the rest of the summer.\n\nThe rivers are rising rapidly and those who have timber coming down had better hurry.\n\nYesterday was a delightful day. The mercury rose to 90 degrees in the shade, and the weather was very fine.\n\nReliable information has been received at this office that all the squatters' claims in the vicinity of Calgary will be settled at once.\n\nBUFFALO HALL!\n\nNEW GOODS ARE BEING OPENED EACH WEEK.\n\nAlways on hand Fresh Lines in Dry Goods, Clothing and Groceries.\n\nPrices will be found right and nothing but reliable goods shown.\n\nBUFFALO HALL\n\nDress Goods, Corsets, Hosiery, etc., Ready-made Clothing\n\nBETTS & Gwynne\n\nDress Goods, all shades\n\nIrish Diaper Linen, India Linen, Muslins, Nuns' Veiling, Silk Gloves, Cottons, Ginghams, Prints, Wincies, Ladies Jerseys Boys' Jersey Suits, Ready-made Clothing.\n\nFROM FOUR YEARS UP\u2014AT\n\nR.
