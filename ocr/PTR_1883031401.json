I hope to obtain from them an adequate building site for the school, which I propose to establish here at Prince Albert. The school will be conducted by Mr. J. Sinclair, who has been engaged in teaching for many years. The school will be open to all children between the ages of five and fifteen, and will be conducted according to the best methods known. I am confident that the school will be a great benefit to the people of Prince Albert.\n\nHugh M'Dougall.\nEast End Bakery.\n\nTO THE LADIES.\n\nMilinery and Ladies Furnishings\n\nMISS MACK & CO.,\nCampbell's Block,\nRiver Street,\nPrince Albert, N.W.T.\n\nW.
