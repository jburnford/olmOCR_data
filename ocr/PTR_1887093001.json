The proceedings were of the most gratifying nature. The turn out of exhibitors and spectators was large, and we shall give a full description, with prize list, in next issue.\n\nA recent issue of the London Times has a letter from Mr. J. C. Hawkins, who says that the expression of what undoubtedly is the prevalent feeling in Canada with regard to commercial union with the United States. The gist of the matter is, that if the Dominion house barrier were abolished, Canadian manufactured articles would certainly be swamped by the surplus products of the States. It is a well-known fact that the accumulated wealth of years could be lavished in endeavoring by American political magnates in the task of underselling, at any cost and any sacrifice, the obstinate Canadian producers, for the purpose of eventually establishing their own supremacy and obtaining a monopoly of the Canadian market.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific company can congratulate itself upon the success which has attended its efforts to persuade the British Government to subsidize it for carrying the mails by the sea route. The time is drawing near when the line before the eyes of the world than anything that has yet occurred. It will be the means of inducing the tourists and travelers to take this route on their way to China and Japan, and thus the plain influence is felt that, as the British Government has put its endorsement on the line by subsidizing it to carry the mails, it must be the quickest route. Canada will have attracted attention to the front and attracting the notice of the countries at the other end of the earth. Some of these days the British Government will see the advantage of the route, not only for postal purposes, but for military transportation.\n\nWhat must be the mental condition of the man who has nothing to do? How does he put the day in, and to what does he look forward when he sees his wife and children in the sun shining in the morning? Most people have their business to look after, or their work to do in the factory or shop, but in every community there are some who have nothing to do, and find no manner to drag out an existence day after day and year after year. It must be hard work. An object in life justifies an existence. Those who have no object in life therefore not only fail to find their own existence justified by the community by continuing to exist. How would it be if some strange transformation of the conditions of existence were to be suddenly thrust aside, the conditions of primitive life were re-established and every man had to go out and shoot or fish or dig up roots with his hands in order to secure his daily existence? Surely those who would prefer people who go gathering through life would look rather foolish if left to their own devices. What will they then do when the next period after they leave this one. They will be forced to earn their food and will always be at their heels. It may be observed that those whose purpose in life is simply to kill time usually succeed in killing not only themselves but others also. If the worst turns a father can do for his boy is to give him a good trade or profession. One of the worst is to leave him a lot of money to do with as he pleases.\n\nThere seems to be more discussion over the appointment of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain as the British representative on the fisheries commission than there ever has been. Mr. Chamberlain is a man of marked ability and has for some years been looked upon as the most likely man in England to succeed Gladstone. He is clever enough to see which side is winning the battle and for ten years has quit the Gladstone ranks on the Irish question, seeing that the English people would never consent to let Ireland go. His instincts and prejudices are English and he would have been quite at home with Mr. Gladstone than in company with Lord Salisbury or even Lord Harrington. When they were colleagues in the same Cabinet Chamberlain used to say that he would rather serve under Lord Salisbury than Lord Harrington. He called him an anti-chamber politician and the Rip Van Winkle of British politics. He announced that the Radicals had been born in the hold long enough and that they ought to be allowed to work on the quarter deck whereas they spent all their time. Mr. Goschen he pleasantly referred to as an English mummy. Fancy if in Canada one member of the D. C. T. A. Board of Directors, to talk to criticizing his colleagues! People would never get over it. It is easy to see that Mr. Chamberlain is not altogether at his ease in his present position. He should not give the impression that his undoubted support in putting Ireland under the provisions of the Crimes Act, and it is clear that he still keeps in view Mr. Gladstone's minute. We shall see how he looks after British interests in the future affairs.\n\nSocialists have been pushing them selves into notice in New York by holding a meeting and shouting \"Down with the United States.\" There are in the United States about nine millions of people and a few more Socialists, and it is only fair to assume that the nine millions will be able to hold their own against the few score. In Chicago the Anarchists who were very convinced that socialism was really still awaiting the judgment of the higher court to which their case was appealed. That they will go to the gallows no one now believes. Had they been charged for murder or for sedition, the moral effect throughout the republic would have been great. Expressing one's opinions about property and the right of the people is one thing; murder is another. Such violent characters have responded to the invitation of the republic to leave the shores of foreign lands and come to the land where liberty prevails in its greatest extent that our cry should be up on the part of the law-abiding element to close the gates. The people who come bring their peculiar sentiments with them. They change their skin but their character remains the same. The Americans are an easy going people, but once they make up their minds to suppress a nuisance they do not let the grass grow under their feet. Some day they will awake and realize that to allow the Socialists and Anarchists, and for a time matters will be lively.\n\nMr. Wm. Tait is erecting a storehouse on Church-street.\n\nThe Rev.

As nothing could be done to save it, the attention of the men was directed on another and much larger stack, and by the application of water it was saved. The steamer will be charged $80 or $90.
