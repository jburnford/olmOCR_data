There was a child once who said it was wicked, and the grocer found out that his parents have been lying to it about the Santa Claus business. But you know, Santa Claus used to come down chimneys, and when I asked how a fat fellow would come down through a chimney, he would go through a stove pipe, pa would tell me that Santa Claus was made of India rubber, and that he could squeeze himself down any way, that didn't get anything made a change in the Christmas tree business for our church. You see, there have been a lot of people who have been children together the night before Christmas, and seeing a Christmas tree, and it is cruel on the old children. When the parents put expensive presents on the trees for their children, and the poor children stand there whimpering for a corn ball or an orange. The poor children began to think Santa Claus showed particularity, and the poor employed of the rich folks, and they were obliged to get something on Santa Claus, but this time me and my chum sold all the presents we got, and bought a whole lot of nice things for the poor boys, and when the chums began to distribute the presents, and find that the boys that months made up for popcorn balls, and they got ice skates and fur caps, and nice things, matters of course, the minister was afraid the church would be pulled as a disorderly house. I never had so much fun in my life, I'd like to see those poor boys happy in the seats. All I have got left is this necktie and almost diamond, but the fireman has made me a forty-five diamond, and it bright to me though it was the holiest. Do you know what a holiest is? It is the holiest thing in the world.\"\n\n\"That's a good boy,\" said the grocer man, as he shaded his eyes to look at the bad boy, and then he thought of the fireman's song, he said, \"It's half a crown.\"\n\n\"But there is one thing I want to talk to you about. I saw you jump on a house to save the firemen from the fire at the fire last night, and your pa said you was hanging around the engine house a good deal, and I thought maybe that. Those firemen are pretty tough, and you will be spoiled if you go with them. You will be doing nothing to do with them, or you will bring yourself a gray hair in sorrow to the grave. Fire men are hard to hang around.\"\n\n\"When was this that firemen were hard citizens?\" asked the boy indignantly.\n\n\"They are just as good citizens as you are,\" said the grocer man, \"but they hang down collar, from the keystone barrel what do you do? Do you go down collar and put on a suit? No, you don't. You grab your fireman's pith helmet tight, and the firemen come and they go tight through your soldered belt hole burning kerplunking, and you sit there, and you are overcome by the smoke, when their partners draw you out by the legs, and others pull off their coat and pull you up the flight until your property is saved, and when you come back and kick because they stop you, they say, 'We're here to save lives and women and children.' Do they do it for nothing? No, they do it for $75 a month, and you pay that to the man who drives your grocery wagon. There isn't a man who gets as much salary as a fireman.\"\n\nTHE GABLE HOUSE.\n\nTHE PRINCE ALBERT TIMES\n\nAND\n\nSASKATCHEWAN REVIEW.\n\nThe Leading Weekly Paper in the Province.\n\n$2.50 PER ANNUM.\n\n\"The Times\" Contains all Original Matter.\n\nAdvertise in \"The Times.\"\n\nAnd have your Advertisement read by all.\n\nReplete with Local and General News.\n\nSubscribe!

As the meeting was about to break up, one of the dergymen spoke to the reverend lape-maker and informed him that the minister was from England. 'Shakespeare,' replied the old minister; 'that can't be, for I've never read Shakespeare.'\n\nThe audience had not improved much with its travel, however. It arose out of a warm discussion on a very grave theological point, and the minister started divining the old fellow's views six years ago, and occasioned some laughter at the time. A recent good man, in making upon the heretics the solemn obligations they were under to uphold the faith, exclaimed with great earnestness: 'I say, Mr. So-and-so, I believe that England expects every man this day to do his duty.' After the meet- ing, when the minister was leaving, he heard saying to another, 'That was a ridiculous kind of Brother.' 'Yes, sir,' was the reply; 'but I believe it was known that it was,'\u2014saying of the Duke of Wellington.\n\n(Sometime it will be said that even ministers commit historical blunders. It is not much to be wondered at that if poor ignorant editors should misquote scripture, or if a minister should be thought to be considered that very often their early education in the good book has been neglected. The following story is told of a joke played upon a western editor (United States of course) by a wag who sent him a copy of the Bible. The editor had never heard of it before and thinking it was a new publication he wrote that it was a romance in prose, but entered, but as a matter of history it is laughable.)\n\nAdvertising.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune, it is said, receives for a column of advertisements, $3,000 per year. The New York Herald received for its advertising space $65,724 and for its highest $38,000. The New York Tribune, for the lowest, $29,834, and for the highest $100,000. This paper it is stated, has never at a loss for advertisements to fill their columns. That is largely due to the prices charged by the Halfpenny press.\n\n(This is slightly above the average charged by the Prince Albert Times and yet the people will complain of high rates.)\n\nMust the something.\n\n\"Yes,\" the tall thin passenger admitted, \"a crying baby is bound to wake But then the mother's voice calms it away and, when a human being is shuddered up and down on the loose end of a tough stick sufficiently, it's got to do something. If it can't, it's a case of hell.\" And the jury was only out two minutes, and came in with a verdict for the defendant.\n\nA medical writer asserts that women are so constructed that they cannot jump.

A single hair is to look at; how insignificant, and yet what power there is in it! A hair has been cut off by death, and yet it is the cause of sorrow that has been pent up for years to break forth afresh, and the events of years will pass away.\n\nA single hair from the head of a woman a man loves, will draw tears from his eyes, and make the earth quiver if it is attached to his heart at one end and to her dear head at the other. A single hair has been the means of breaking hearts, and tearing off the wrong collar of the wrong coat. There is something about a hair on a man's coat that seems to convey a meaning, a secret at once, and an explanation even, sets that hair right. And yet how easy it is for the woman who gets on a man's coat in a street car, at the theatre, or anywhere that women wear their hair loose. The air is full of it, and it is a great wonder that there are not more accidents on men's coats. A coat made of rough material is bound to catch hairs that are going to fall off, and women should realize that accidents will happen, but they don't. If hair was at all same color, much trouble might be avoided, but probably it never will be.\n\nThere is a man in Milwaukee whose life is now in peril because of a hair on his coat. He is a man who never thought twice of any woman other than his wife. He is blind in one eye, he has lost his hearing, his teeth are nearly all shot out, he is bald, with a fringe of carrotty hair down by his ears, and altogether a man who is likely to attract attention by his peculiarly handsome appearance. But his wife has an idea that he is a terror, and finally believed that he had been seeing another sight in the society of other women and he never comes home but she searches him for strangers' hair. The boys in the show bar, where he went, told her of his wife's jealousy, and it is a cold day when they don't put a female hair or two on his coat. His wife has always been so afraid that he had begun to look upon his profession as a joke, and so to keep his mind from this obsession he encourages her in her hair hunting, and believes it is the only enjoyment she has. Her jealousy has known her personality and when she goes to church the congregation glances at the poor man she sees if he has been picked. One day the girl had been to church, and when she came back to her chair and the hair reached to the floor, and it was greatly admired. The husband of the girl had been to church, and tried to secure one of those hairs, and after shadowing the minister for a moment, Saturday morning he got his hair, and the girl had been crying, and he rolled it up and put it in his pocket-book.\n\nThe next day she went to church with his wife after admonishing the hair in his coat, leaving about two inches of the end sticking out of his coat. He felt a solemnity about his hair, and he could see that hair, and she did. The minister was praying, and the hairless man looked among the people, and the hairless woman looked as though she would have given largely to the heathen if it had been possible. She knew that the worst done people looking, and the perplexities started out on her face. The minister finished through praying and the people raised their heads, and she thought there must be an end to all things, pulled at the hair again, and got it out. She looked at it, and it was about four feet of one hair in her lap, and she locked it up in a helpless sort of manner as though she could not understand it. Her hair was full of that hair, and as she knew she would have to get up with the congregation to sing, she pulled again, and then her heart sank within her. She had five feet of it, and yet there was no end.\n\nShe had heard that hair was very good for the stomach, and she had been foolish by putting a spool of black silk thread in his vest for her hair, but all that was useless. She had been told that it was an unnamable ache, and she pulled again and got another foot, and no end, and she knew that she must go to church, though she was afraid if she kept on pulling she would fill a full grown woman's hair store. She looked at the woman and noted every sign of confusion was on her, and as the minister read the hymn he looked at her and she looked at him looking at him. Just as they were about to rise and sing, she gave one last, lingering, impassioned pull, and the hair fell out of her hand and the rolled it up in her handkerchief and got up to sing; but her face was red, and she looked pale.\n\nBefore the service was over, the minister of the church had asked her handkerchief out of the pocket of her coat, took out the hair and laid it on the altar, and then asked her where she had got it, and she said she had got it on her coat where he had been to get his hair cut, and she had been to church with the subject of female hairs. She told him she would show him when she also got home; and she did. She showed him how she got it, and the husband was so solicitous after her health\u2014telling her he was going to have her examined by doctors, examined by doctors, examined by doctors, that she thought she was insane\u2014that she actually believed she had imagined all that she had experienced in church with the long hairless man, and she thought she was a maniacomaniac on the subject of long hairs and from that day she has never seen a hair on a coat, and she has never come near a church, and she has never gone into a house with a whole head of female hair on her coat, and the wife\u2014who had such a narrow mind\u2014would never see the hair. But those who saw her pull in that hair, as though she was going to church, will always remember how the sight of her husband was ravelling out inside.\n\nPROSPECTUS OF THE Prince Albert Directory.\n\nBUSINESS GUIDE.\n\nIt is proposed to issue a Business Directory for the town of Prince Albert and District of N.W.T., in a pamphlet form containing the names and addresses of each business establishment, (which is inserted at moderate rate) and a descriptive notice of each.\n\nThis directory will contain a history of Prince Albert, its present condition and future prospects, together with a statement of the resources of the district which will be ascertained for the District of Lorne, extent of acreage cultivated, number of acres per inch, population, number of years of settlement of district, and other useful information, written by a well known journalist.\n\nAbout 500 or more minutes will be published (subject to the encouragement received) which will be distributed throughout the Dominion and the Mother Country.\n\nIt is hoped that by this means, benefit will result, not only to each individual business man, but to the district as a whole, which will become better known and appreciated both at home and abroad and a healthy enthusiasm encouraged among the people.\n\nPrice of advertisement, whole page, with notice on opposite page, 10\u00a2; two pages, 6\u00a2; single copies, 5\u00a2.\n\nSTRAYED\n\nStrayed on my premises, since last spring, and can't find owner\u2014a GRIZZLY COW with twin calves, brown and a star on her hip.

It does not require the historian to show us that there was occurring in this land of Egypt with which we are so familiar from our earliest years, a movement of trade and commerce of such vast importance to our little Island, and our only outlet for the traffic in India, that it must have been felt in every part of the world. In these days of invention and electricity, the old way of doing things seems almost obsolete, and we scarcely be able to hold good, as the formation of the telegraph closed following upon the event, which has been so much to make way for its successor. Only a few months ago, when we heard that the telegraph had been successful in carrying news, it became necessary to dispatch a sum armed force to Egypt, where the Committee had been unable to reach the expedition as to the result, and some nations, more especially the French, with whom we are on terms of amity and alliance, neither gave us their support by word or deed, so great did they think was the importance of the discovery and application of the telegraph over the discussion of the factions of the so-called \"High Priests\" of India, who, with their eyes fixed on the future, the religious supremacy over millions of minds, the secret of the East. It is the same story into the Egyptian War, and the short but glorious war that was so successfully got through, and the result of which is now known, because they are not really things of the past, and well-known to all, though quite recent events. But what is the future? What will be the success of our mission to the north of Africa? What should be done in the north of Africa? What should be done in the north of Africa? What should be done in the north of Africa?\n\nBUFFALO HALL!\n\nClearing Sale!\n\nBargains!\n\nBetts & Gwynne.\n\nCoal Oil.\n\n500 Gallons,\n\nAmerican and Canadian,\n\nat\n\nJ. L.
