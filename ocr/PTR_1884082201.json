The result of this observation of the nature of long seen prevailing customs of settling local disputes or feuds (e.g., those existing between the Highlanders and Lowlanders) has been that they do not appear to the latter as the only possible solution of the question. We cannot imagine that we can persuade the cause may be referred to that great mystery\u2014the introduction of evil into the world for the same purpose, whereupon we should see, at the end of all the labors of human life, should provide such a highly increased tendency to destruction, some of the more convenient means being the implements of murder, which would constitute the part of evident genius in land and water. These reflections are not immediately suggested by a perusal of the humeral account of Mr. Greely's expedition, but the fact of its existence, and its apparent commercial benefit to humanity, must not only by deeply displayed, but also universally condemned by the world as a whole. There could be no doubt, however, that such a publication for such an expedition as has been sent by our government to explore the navigability of Hudson Bay and Strait, even were their aims not approached, produces loss of valuable time which is not the case, because upon the result of that depend the interests of the future, an enormous proportion of the human race, and it is desirable that every precaution be taken to save this great country from ever life to such a cause, but speaking under correction we do not believe that practical results will be found to justify the terrible sacrifices made in the attempt to discover the secrets of the Arctic region. We freely admit ignorance of science despatches the bulk of the general public from forming any exact judgment upon the relative importance of the subject in question; but if the advantages are such as will affect any appreciable proportion of humanity, then they can be explained, directed, or studied to advantage, sufficient clearly to understand into what manner they are obtained. We can all admire and sympathize with the spirit which prompted these efforts, until they had been already proved to the hopelessness of attainment, but until the results are shown to comprise something far beyond material for a few scientific essays on meteorological or similar subjects, we must heartily turn to the consideration of any experiment, which not only gain such vast sums of money, but worse still result in the horrible sufferings only ended by death of so many brave men as have perished in them. Had Lieutenant Greely brought home his men in safety, we can well believe the Americans could pass with patriotic feelings over the loss of some sixty geographic miles nearer the north pole than has been done by any other nation, but when they consider the sickness, details of what prisoners and deaths of their friends and fellow-countrymen involved in all the toils, difficulties, and hardships, full of determined courage to do or die, and then remember how few of themselves will take the trouble to read the reports, to consider the scientific results, the nation large will feel that the game has not been worth the candle, and sometime will have to chance before the past is sufficiently forgotten to encourage further waste of life in the same direction.\n\nABOUT THE TIMES.\n\nWritten for \"The Times.\"\n\nWhat was once written in Prince Albert newspaper is still there.
