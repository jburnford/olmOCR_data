On checking back to our original invoice this should have been 90 pieces, but apparently when our girls were making the copy this was put down as 60.\n\nWe are very sorry that this mistake was made, but would also like to draw to your attention that this invoice was dated August, and if your people had received these goods had checked them off they would have found that there were 90 pieces, and this should have been marked on our copy, provided that our original showed 60. No doubt they will still have a record, but this invoice is now over five months old, and should have been paid at least four months ago.\n\nWe are changing the item to 90 pieces, and trust that you will be able to trace this, and also that your cheque will be sent as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHILL-CLARK-FRANKLIN, LTD.\n\nJEA/OA.\n\nSecretary-Treasurer\nOttawa, April 24th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department has just received from your office the account of Hill-Clark-Francois, Limited, in connection with lumber supplied to the Moose Port Indian Residential School.

[Signature]\nAgent\nOttawa, December 4th, 1936.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nRecently, I had an opportunity of discussing with the Honourable, the Minister, the proposal of the Church of England to erect, at their own expense, a new building to replace the present Keene Fort Indian Residential School.\n\nIn the event of your doing so, the Minister is disposed to favourably consider providing per capita allowance for one hundred (100) pupils, if accommodation for that number is available in the new building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D., D.C.L., D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto 5, Ont.\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nYour letter, dated the 4th inst., file 44-6-1, stating that my proposal to erect at the expense of the Church of England in Canada \"a new building to replace the present Moose Fort Indian Residential School\" was submitted by you to the Minister and that he \"is disposed to favourably consider providing per capita allowances for one hundred (100) pupils, if accommodation for that number is available in the new building;\" was considered by the Executive Committee of this Society at its meeting on the 16th inst.\n\nThe Executive Committee decided unanimously to proceed this summer with the erection of the building in question on the assumption that the Minister being satisfied of the accommodation provided in the new building, a further letter would be received from him definitely accepting the proposal as submitted by me to you; viz., that the provision will be made for per capita grants, at the existing rate of $200.00, for 60 additional pupils bringing the total provision up from the present number of 40 to 100; this rate to continue unchanged for a period of 10 years after we have secured an attendance of 100 pupils in the new school.\n\nConcerning our ability to obtain 100 pupils, the Bishop of Moosonee, who knows the Anglican Indian population of the District very thoroughly and whom I consulted on the point, states in part in his reply as follows:\n\n\"Wherever I have gone during the past three years particularly, I have been besieged with requests from parents to have their children admitted to the Moose Boarding School and have been obliged to say there was no room.... So that I have not the slightest doubt that we can secure 100 pupils for the school at Moose.\"\nDr. Harold McGill\n\nThe Principal of the School places the number that would desire admittance to the new school from 120 to as high as 150. There is, therefore, I am convinced, no question concerning an enrollment to the capacity of the school at an early date after it is erected and open.\n\nAs you are aware, I think, Mr. Orr is now drafting a plan for us which will ensure that the dormitory space provided has the necessary subic air content conforming to the regulation of the Department.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I am assuming that the final and full agreement of the Hon'ble, the Minister, is assured and that I may proceed as soon as the plans are completed to take the steps necessary for the erection of the school during the coming summer since the large amount of materials necessary must be delivered at Moosonee for transportation over the ice before the Spring break-up.\n\nIt was further understood and agreed between us that the Department would provide the cost - seats, blackboards, etc. - of the equipment of the new classrooms; in this case to be provided for in a separate building.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nS. [Signature]\nGeneral Secretary,\n\nSG:G\nJanuary 4th, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Minister,\n\nWhen discussing our Estimates with the Minister and yourself on the second instant, you will remember I mentioned that the Church of England had proposed that, if the pupilage at the Moose Fort Indian Residential School were increased from forty (40) to one hundred (100), the Church authorities would be prepared to erect a new building suitable for the accommodation of the increased number of pupils.\n\nHonourable Mr. Creer expressed his willingness to favourably consider the offer of the Church of England and I so advised Canon Gould on the 4th instant.\n\nCanon Gould replied by stating that the Church of England is prepared to proceed with the erection of a new building during the coming summer and requests that, in addition to the increased pupilage, the Department provide the children's desks, blackboards and other minor equipment for the classrooms.\n\nAt the present time the Department is allowing grant for a pupilage of 40. The rate per capita at this school is $200. Consequently, the increased per capita allowance would be $17,000. The cost of the desks, blackboards, etc., would be approximately $900.\n\nI would recommend that Rev. Canon Gould be informed that, on the completion of the new building, grant for 100 pupils will be allowed and also that the Department will provide the desks and blackboards.\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\nDr. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nFollowing the receipt from Mr Orr of outline plans for the accommodation of 100 pupils in the proposed new Indian Residential School building at Moose Factory, I am having the working plans prepared by our local architects. On the completion of their work I propose to award the contracts for the large amounts of material etc.\n\nOn reading copy of my letter to you, dated the 18th inst., I note that the word \"existing\" in the second paragraph was inserted through a mistake and should, in consequence, be omitted.\n\nThe main building will measure 38 by 115 feet, and be three storeys in height. The wing will measure 30 by 64 feet providing space for boys recreation room, laundry, boys and girls wash rooms, on the ground floor; the whole of the second floor being devoted to classrooms.\n\nAll the lumber will be cut to size and form in a mill at South Porcupine, shipped to Moosonee and transported over the ice to Moose Factory Island. As soon as the spring thawing of the ground permits the placing of the foundations, the work of erection will proceed with great speed.\n\nAs stated in my letter, dated the 18th inst., I am interpreting your letter dated the 4th inst. to mean that on completion of a building with accommodation for \"one hundred (100) pupils\" departmental provision at a per capita of $200 will be made for ten years for that number. It is because\nof my anxiety to exclude any possible occasion in the future\nof misunderstanding on this essential point that, at the risk\nof repetition, I am writing this further letter.\n\nFailing any advice from you to the contrary, I shall\nproceed as indicated above.\n\nWith every good wish for the New Year,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, January 11, 1937.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI received your letter of December 31st, with reference to the new Indian residential school which the Church of England proposes to erect at Moose Factory, Ont.\n\nOn receipt of your letter of December 15th, I formally placed your request for increased pupilage and seats, blackboards, etc., before the Honourable the Minister. As yet, I have not received his reply, but expect to do so in the near future and will immediately write to you. I would suggest that you hold your plans in abeyance until you hear further from me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, M.D., B.C.L., D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada,\n604 Jarvis St.,\nToronto,\nOnt.\nReferring to your memorandum of the 4th instant, (file 44-6-1) regarding the proposed construction of a new building at the Moose Fort Indian Residential School, I discussed the matter with the Minister and he thinks it would be advisable to postpone any decision until we definitely know what the Estimates will be for the coming year.\n\nC.W.

My mistake arose from the fact that in a letter from the Assistant Secretary-Treasurer of our Indian Residential School Commission he had mistakenly quoted the lower figure; on the other hand the amounts given in the body of the letter showed that the same were made up on the basis of a per capita grant at the rate of $200.00 per annum.

My letters in this connection to the Department, therefore, stand as written.\n\nPlease accept this expression of my every good wish for the success of your very important work on behalf of the Indian wards of the Dominion.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nS.O.\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nP.S. I am sending a copy of this letter to Dr. McGill.\nDr. McGill,\nDirector, of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nEnclosed please find copy of self-explanatory letter of today's date to Mr Hoey.\n\nI cannot understand how the Assistant Secretary-Treasurer of our Indian Residential School Commission, usually a very careful man, fell into the error noted. As I have stated in my letter to Mr Hoey, the sums given in the body of his letter show that he was computing the same on the basis of a per capita grant of $200.00.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary\n\nSG:G\nEncl-1\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo...Rev.

McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nIt gives me much pleasure to enclose enlargement of my snap-shot of our new buildings at Moose Factory.\n\nFrom right to left the buildings are:\n\n1. The new Cottage Hospital.\n\n2. The Annex, with outside scaffolding still in position, to the main building. The Annex provides on the ground floor for the laundry, the boys and girls wash rooms and the boys recreation room. The second storey consists of two very large and well-lighted classrooms. A closed and covered passageway of twenty feet connects the Annex with the main building.\n\n3. The main building of the school. This building provides, on the ground floor - Chapel, kitchen and dining rooms for the pupils and staff; on the second floor, dormitories for junior boys and girls, office, and staff bedrooms and sitting room; on the third floor, main dormitories for senior boys and girls, with rooms for supervisors; the fourth floor, or attic, provides sewing room, large recreation room for girls and general storage rooms.\n\nThe cubic air-space provided for the dormitories is somewhat in excess of that required by the Departmental regulations.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSG;G\n\nEnclosure\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, August 30, 1937.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of August 21st and also snapshot of the new residential school established by you at Moose Factory, attached thereto.\n\nThis photograph suggests that the buildings are quite spacious and substantial.

School\nMoose Factory\nOnt.\n\nDATE | AMOUNT\n---|---\nNov. 8 | To allowance towards salary of night watchman at Moose Fort Indian Residential School for the month of October, 1937. 40.00\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. 600\n\n[Signature]\n\nAged\nNEW BUILDINGS: The two years which elapsed since your Secretary visited this historic centre during the summer of 1935 were busy and eventful ones, and the progress made in that comparatively short time greatly exceeded his expectations. In the establishment of the full modern Newhamackett Hospital, with ten beds, two cots, and one bassinette, and in the creation of a new, three and a half storey Residential School building, with ample accommodation for 100 pupils, the Church of England in Canada has furnished unquestionable proof of her deep and practical interest in all that pertains to the highest welfare of her numerous and devoted Indian people in the Moose Factory and James Bay areas. Never once, so far as your Secretary has been able to ascertain, since the arrival of John Horden (afterwards Bishop) in 1851, has the Church of England failed to provide resources for the part of the mid-Indian field where it is surely pleasing that the good and glorious work which they began and carried on so faithfully and so long, should now be maintained and extended by their successors with the increased resources and facilities they have at their command. The double process of maintenance and extension will be vastly stabilized and accelerated through the provision of those two very necessary and very efficient buildings, and one cannot but devoutly thank God for the abundance of wisdom and help bestowed upon the General Secretary of our Society, whereby he was enabled to find a way of making this provision possible.\n\nTHE HOSPITAL: As members have already received the printed pamphlet which furnishes considerable information about the Hospital, your Secretary does not consider it necessary to make any detailed reference to it in this report.\n\nAt the time of his visit five patients were in residence, two of them having been brought from Fort George a distance of approximately 300 miles. As two more were expected to be transferred from the Hospital at Cochrane, there is ground grants for believing that the operating costs may be fully met by the usual for patients as made by the Indian Department.\n\nFor the time being, at any rate, Nurse Hockin, who is in charge, and Mrs Saucier, the House Matron, are quite sufficient to cope with the work, and additional help is not required.\n\nThe General Secretary recommends that responsibility for the Hospital be vested in the Commission, in the same way that the one at Hay River now stands, and your Secretary commends this recommendation to the members for sympathetic consideration and acceptance. It is the opinion of the General Secretary that the unification of control of\nall the Society's work at this important centre, possesses advantages which should not be disregarded, and he expressed the hope that the members of the Commission would take the same view of the matter.\n\nTHE SCHOOL: The new buildings with the annex, the purpose of which will be described later, is pleasing in design, spacious in capacity and substantial in structure. The foundations rest on cement piles with wide footings, and the roofing material is asphalt shingles of the best quality. There is a neat little belfry on the apex of the tower at the east end, surmounted by a cross, and the bell itself, purchased and contributed funds from the local Indian community, has an unusually mellow tone. As the exterior of the building is painted a cream colour, with door and window frames in brown, the general effect, when viewed from a distance and against a background of green foliage, is decidedly pleasing.\n\nTHE ANNEX: At the east end of the main building (School) (which is 118 feet long by 52 feet wide) and connected therewith by a closed-in passage, there is another building, 64 feet long by 30 feet wide, which provides comfortable space on the ground floor for wash rooms for the boys and girls (each 24 feet wide by 15 feet) the laundry, the light and power plant, and a recreation room for the boys (29 feet by 15 feet.) On the upper floor it provides two well-lighted class rooms, each 30 feet by 30 feet, separated by a partition which can easily be removed when the combined space is required for an entertainment or general assembly.\n\nYour Secretary feels confident that the detachment of the class-room work from the main school building will strongly commend itself to the members of the Commission, as it is in keeping with the policy they have been hoping for some years to have adopted at a number of the other schools under their control.\n\nTHE CHAPEL: Of all the rooms on the ground floor of the main building itself, undoubtedly the most interesting and beautiful is the one set apart, and furnished in oak, as a Chapel.\n\nThe Chapel is 50' 8\" in length, 13' 4\u00bd\" in width, has a Communion Table, Prayer Desk, and two chairs at the Sanctuary end, and a sufficient number of seats and kneeling boards in the nave to accommodate the staff and a capacity enrollment of pupils. The beauty and dignity of this room are greatly enriched by a window (2'4\" x 1' 2\") of stained glass, located on the outside wall directly opposite to the main entrance. In the four\ncorners of this delightfully and artistically coloured window are excellent portraits of Bishop Horden, Archbishop MacKay, Bishop Anderson, and the Rev. John East, while a panel in the lower half carries a remarkably fine reproduction of the painting of Bishop Kountze's momentous journey to the Red River. In a corresponding panel near the top of the window may be seen the lady Foundress of the W.A., as she unfolds to the Board of Management, D & F.M.S., the plans which, under Divine guidance and protection culminated in the honoured and Dominion-wide organization so well known today.\n\nIn the centre of the window appears the Saviour of the World, blessing disciples gathered out of various nations, an Indian and Eskimo included, and, in the border on either side of this central group may be seen the official monogram of the M.S.C.C. and the Winchester Cross of the \"7.\" We who see this window are ever likely to forget it, and one can only hope and pray that all who worship in this quiet and peaceful room may receive such fresh inspiration from the record which the memorial window carries of the heroic men and women of the past, as will enable them to dedicate their own lives to similar great undertakings for Christ in the future. Fastened to the walls on either side of the memorial window, and becomingly framed are reproductions of the two paintings by Margaret T. Tarrant, one of which is entitled \"LOVING SHEPHERD OF THY SHEEP,\" and the other \"BEHOLD I SEND YOU FORTH.\"\n\nOther rooms on the ground floor of the main school building are as follows:\n\n1. Children's refectory (50' x 30')\n2. Staff dining room (15'4\" x 13')\n3. Hall (45' x 10') with three furnaces\n4. Kitchen and pantry\n5. Store room, and\n6. Dairy.\n\nAt either end of the first floor are spacious children's dormitories, one of which is 48' x 16' and the other 55'6\" x 14'. Connecting these are two passage-ways, each 64' long by approximately 4'4\" wide. On this floor is located the Principal's office (15'10\" x 12'); the staff sitting room (32'3\" x 16' 6\"); three bed rooms, each 15'10\" x 10'; a guest room of the same size; a women's wash room 15'10\" x 7'5\"; and a Supervisor's room 16'4\" x 10'.\n\nThe Second Floor has two dormitories each 56' x 38' and two supervisor's rooms, each 13'4\" x 9'.\n\nThe Attic provides a room for storing clothing; another room for general storage; a recreation room for girls (49'4\" x 14'); and a sewing room 16' x 13'4\".\n\nAll rooms throughout the building are well lighted and storm and screen windows are available for winter and summer use respectively.\n\nFURNISHINGS AND EQUIPMENT. The annex will be heated by two Banner Furnaces, No. 333, made by the Galt Stove and Furnace Co., and the main school building by three Banner Furnaces, No. 328, year 1921, made by the same Company. The furnaces in the annex will burn wood, and those in the main school building wood and coal.\n\nA Delco plant, Model No. 23-0-1, Serial No. 375902, 2500 watts, and 52 batteries will provide the light, also power to pump the water and operate the two Thor washers to be installed in the laundry.\nThe Water Supply is drawn from the river, with a Delco motor (Model 3747, Serial No. 026,115 volts D.C.) installed in a cement shaft on the river bank to operate the pump, and force the water through a 2\" pipe to the school, a distance of some 430 feet. Due care has been given to the question of protecting the pipe against the severe frosts of winter.\n\nThere is a pressure, also a hot water tank in the laundry, a jacket heater. A table will be provided, also a stove for heating smoothing irons.\n\nTables and benches were available for the children's refectory, also a table for the staff dining room. Beds for the dormitories had been ordered, and there appeared to be every indication that the building would be ready for occupation by the end of the current year.\n\nAFFILIATED BUILDINGS - such as a modern stock barn, implement shed, poultry house, pigsty, etc., will have to be provided as funds from the Department or some other source become available. The \"mission house,\" or staff part of the old school plant will be left standing and used for storing supplies. A root-house will be covered by putting a cement basement under this building. The Principal estimates that about 50 bags of cement will be required, and your Secretary recommends that the Department be asked to provide this, and the affiliated buildings mentioned.\n\nSTOCK. The School has four good horses at present, and these are sufficient for current needs. It has four cows milking, one dry, one heifer and one bull. More cows will be required in the Spring.\n\nTHE STAFF. The numerical strength of the existing staff, if augmented by one Teacher and one Supervisor, will probably be found sufficient to handle the work of the new and larger school.\n\nTHE PRINCIPAL (Rev. Gilbert Thompson, B.A.) is a diligent and capable worker. He conducts three services each Sunday - one at 11 o'clock in the Church at Moosonee, and the other two in the Church near the School, on the Island.\n\nTHE PUPILS. The enrolment of pupils at the time of your Secretary's visit was 39, but the daily attendance at the class room was not less than 80. The non-Treaty pupils receiving classroom instruction number 25, and there are about as many Treaty Indian children from the Settlement who benefit in the same way. Rev. Louis Sampson, the Teacher, has carried on the classroom quite steadily and faithfully, but it appeared to your Secretary that his qualifications better fitted him for work amongst senior grades, and none of which are to be found at this school. He himself has keen desire to return to ministerial work and your Secretary advised him to communicate with some Bishops with a view to securing a suitable opening.\n\nT.B.R.W.\nTORONTO 5, ONT., November 15th, 1937.\n\nDr. Harold W.

Williams,\n\nDear Sirs-\n\nIn line with your request to the Delco Motor Products at Oshawa, and their Mr. Mounts' letter to your attention under date of January 28th, we would quote on equipment for Fire Alarm System and Watchman's Detector Stations for the school at Moose Factory, as follows:\n\n---\n\nClose Circuit\u2014operation of any station sounds a predetermined code ring four times on all bells in the circuit. This circuit is supervised and is so arranged that if there is any trouble on any circuit such as grounds or short circuits, no trouble bell will ring in the Engineer's or Superintendent's office indicating that there is trouble on the line and can be examined and adjusted so that the system will be maintained 100% for alarm purposes.\n\n---\n\n11 - 6\" Single Stroke $22.95 each\n7 - P.A. Stations - 1275-2 Surface Type $50.10 each\n1 - Type SS Control Panel 1 circuit $172.00 each\n\n---\n\nGeneral Fire Circuit System:\n\nOperation of any break Glass Station causes all vibrator bells in the circuit to ring continuously until a new glass is placed in the station. This circuit is not supervised, and should be tested at intervals to make sure that there is no fault on the circuit in case an actual alarm is put through.\n\n11 - 6\" Bells Vibrating 110 volts D.C. $19.55 each\n7 - 261 - break Glass Stations, Surface. $10.20 each\n\n---\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED HEREIN, QUOTATIONS ARE FOR IMMEDIATE ACCEPTANCE AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE. TERMS AND CONDITIONS ON THE BACK OF THIS PAGE FORM A PART OF THIS QUOTATION.\n\nPLEASE GIVE REFERENCE TO THIS QUOTATION WHEN PLACING YOUR ORDER.\nWe would strongly recommend the use of the closed circuit type, which we believe to be the ideal system for fire alarm protection, although as you will note the cost of this equipment would be somewhat higher than the equipment as used in the general open circuit system. We are returning with this quotation two (2) sets of blueprints which were brought into us by the Aladdin People, and on those we have marked on the various floors the locations which we believe would be best suited to give a general coverage of the equipment. The fire alarm bells are marked in white pencil with a circle with a line through it. The fire alarm stations are marked with the letter \"F\" also in white pencil. These are our impressions of where this equipment should be located from the blueprints themselves, but however, either yourselves or the architect might wish to locate at other points in accordance with the building construction. You might also wish to either decrease or increase the number of stations and bells on anyone floor.\n\nWe would quote in connection with Mr. Maclean's Fire Detector System as follows:\n\n**MACLEAN'S FIRE DETECTOR SYSTEM**\n\nThis System consists of a Fire Detector located in the Superintendent's office with outlying magneto stations over the water main calls which through his visit on permanent record into the detector.\n\n1 - 75' Station Fire Detector (with clock) $14.95 each\n1 - 75' Station Fire Detector (without clock) $13.95 each\n1 - Magneto Stations (Surface) $1.00 each\n\nYou will also find the following information on the blueprint in white pencil, the \"X\" denoting the location of the station, and the numbers would be substituted for the actual number of the station into operation. This would register the time at which that particular station was operated in the station's fire detector shown as a rectangular shape in white pencil with \"X\" inside the Supervisor's room on the first floor. In connection with this Maclean's Fire Detector System we would quote to you that if it is not operated it would have absolutely no connection with your fire alarm system. These remarks would apply to the Maclean's Fire Detector System, too, i.e., as to quantities allowed per set, Fire Alarm System.\n\nWe are enclosing literature giving general information regarding both the fire alarm and Maclean's Fire Detector equipment. All prices quoted would be subject to sales tax included.\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED HEREIN, QUOTATIONS ARE FOR IMMEDIATE ACCEPTANCE AND ARE SUBJECT TO TERMS AND CONDITIONS ON THE BACK OF THIS PAGE FORM A PART OF THIS QUOTATION.\n\nPLEASE GIVE REFERENCE TO THIS QUOTATION WHEN PLACING YOUR ORDER\nNorthern Electric Company\nLIMITED\n\nTo Church House\nFebruary 11th, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing to inform you that we have received your order for two weeks from receipt thereof.\n\nIn connection with the installation of the equipment, I shall need your assistance in preparing a list of all the parts required.

Enclosed herewith is the original of their reply to my letter.\n\nThey recommend the closed circuit system described in their letter (page 1) as the System Type S.S. The cost of this equipment would be $713.15. As the six station time detectors would cost an additional $265.80, or a total of $1008.95, I am writing to ascertain if your Department can authorise this expenditure.\n\nAs the need cannot be questioned, and as you know the dilemma in which our Society stands at present financially, your help in this matter will be appreciated more than it is possible to express.\n\nAlthough I am writing this from our Toronto office, will you please address your reply to me at my Winnipeg office.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 15, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the proposed installation of a fire alarm system in the Moose Factory Residential School.\n\nThis school was recently remodelled by your Commission and I presume was made as fireproof as possible in view of northern conditions. In addition we make an allowance for a night watchman. No special provision was made in the current year's appropriation for such a heavy expenditure as you request at the Moose Factory Residential School and I therefore regret that favourable consideration cannot be given to your request.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nR.

Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYour letter of the 16th ultimo, #44-6-5, awaited me on my return from eastern Canada a short time ago, and I sincerely regret the decision embodied therein, not to provide the fire alarm system requested for our Moose Factory School.\n\nWhen making the request for this equipment as embodied in my letter of the 12th ultimo, I was under the impression that as our Society had made a capital expenditure of approximately $50,000.00 in providing the new school building at Moose Factory, and had therefore, saved your Department that amount, you would be able to help us to the comparatively slight extent indicated, in the same way that you made a grant of approximately $2,000.00 for equipment at our Aklavik School.\n\nFurther, as our Society during the past few years has provided not only the new School building at Moose Factory, but new School buildings at Fort George and Aklavik as well, at a total cost of approximately $125,000.00, the request did not, nor does it yet, appear to me to be an unreasonable one.\n\nAs you state in your letter that \"no special provision was made in the current year's appropriation for such a heavy expenditure as requested at the Moose Factory Residential School\", I have been wondering if some of the saving effected by your Department through the non-payment of P.E. grants could not be made available for the equipment in question. For instance, had capacity attendance of pupils been maintained in 1937 at all the Schools administered by our Society, our Society's revenue would have been increased by the amounts indicated in the following list;\nMarch 1st, 1938.\n\n| Location        | Capacity | Average Attendance | Loss   |\n|-----------------|----------|--------------------|--------|\n| White Fish Lake | 80       | 27.57              | $415.11|\n| Blackfoot       | 100      | 88.23              | $1829.28|\n| Pelican         | 50       | 45.86              | $648.54|\n| Lac la Ronge    | 100      | 97.48              | $479.27|\n| Elkhorn         | 145      | 142.64             | $380.73|\n| Sioux Lookout    | 135      | 99.62              | $5546.21|\n| Chapleau        | 100      | 92.61              | $1123.66|\n\nTotal $10422.80\n\nThis heavy loss in revenue, along with the further loss of approximately $10,000.00 through the 5% cut in the grants, will indicate to you the difficulties which confront our Commission in the efficient administration of our Society's Schools, and while there may be some Department ruling to the effect that p.c. grants which are not earned automatically lapse, I trust that if no such ruling obtains, some of the saving effected last year on grants in this way, may yet be applied to the provision of the fire alarm system requested for Moose Factory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBBW/WH\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa, March 7, 1938.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the first instant, in which you express regret at the inability of the Department to provide the alarm system you requested for the recently constructed residential school at Moose Factory.\n\nI may state by way of comment that negotiations relating to the construction of a residential school at Moose Factory took place before I entered the Department a little over a year ago. It is my understanding, however, that this school was to be constructed and equipped by the Anglican Church authorities and that the Department, in turn, had promised an increase in pupilage from 40 to 100. These negotiations were carried on by Reverend Canon Gould, representing your Church, and Dr. McGill, Director of this Branch.\n\nI note your reference to the funds that might be available as the result of the regulation which permits us to pay only on the average attendance at residential schools. I may state that the average attendance at residential schools is carefully considered when the estimates are prepared from year to year and an amount necessary to pay approximately 92% of the per capita grant payments included. You can readily...\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\ncan readily see, therefore, that there is no surplus available from this source. In addition to this, an Order-in-council was passed recently, making provision for the payment of an additional $5.00 per pupil to residential schools in the province of Saskatchewan. I regret, therefore, that we have not at our disposal in the appropriation of this year the funds necessary for the construction of a fire alarm system at the Moose Factory School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

We agree that there would be no advantage in enlarging the building.\n\nWe now take into the school pupils with a bad family history as long as they are free from T.B., unless you do not allow us to take these children in there is no need of the extra beds, and if you do not allow us to take them in except as special pupils then we could set aside one of the dormitories for their use only.\n\nThe Ontario Government are allowing the hospital to care for halfbeeds so they are enlarging the hospital this summer\u2014two wings of 7 beds each\u2014enlarging the kitchen and bathroom\u2014building a sitting room and installing another bathroom.\n\nI would advise that if we do not have the school for the weak children, we be allowed to admit any child that is at present free from T.B.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.L. Tyrer\nDear Doctor Tyre:\n\nFrom your letter of May 26 it is evident that you wish to use the residential school at Moosonee partly as a preventorium unit. My only comment is that you should watch the school carefully to see that no child remains in it who has tuberculosis in a phase which is a menace to the other children and that those children whom you describe as pupils with a bad family history should have a substantial advantage in the way of feeding, rest, and relief from exertion. If certain dormitories could be set aside for them I think it would be of advantage. This was the object of the other proposed arrangement and it will be so much the better if it can be accomplished without further building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.L.

Further, as many of our Schools keep in touch with the parents of pupils in residence, as well as with graduate pupils, by sending out a monthly letter embodying information of interest to all, the duplicator would be of very great service in more ways than one, and I sincerely hope that you may be able to find some way of providing it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nAugust 24, 1939.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant in which you submit, for Departmental consideration, a request received by you for a duplicator from the Principal of the Moose Factory Indian residential school.\n\nI hesitate to send forward to the Purchasing Department a requisition for a duplicator such as the one described on the sheet enclosed with your communication.

As this building is conveniently located to the new School, and would serve very well for this purpose, the Committee hoped that the arrangement would commend itself to you and to your Department.\n\nAs the existing hospital, however, must continue in operation until a new and larger one has been provided, it was unanimously agreed by the Committee that the provision of the new hospital should be undertaken by the Government.\n\nIn support of this view it was pointed out that as the Society had erected the new School at a cost of over $60,000.00, and the existing hospital at a cost of at least $7,000.00, including equipment, it should not be asked or expected to make any further large expenditure for the new larger hospital required.\n\nI was instructed, therefore, to ask you to include in your estimates for the next fiscal year the sum of at least $10,000.00 to build the larger hospital necessary at this centre.\n\nIt was the unanimous opinion of the members of the Committee that the residence of the Principal should be provided out of Government funds, and, as the cost of materials alone, plus freight, wages, etc., for the existing hospital building amounted to not less than $5,000.00, the Government expenditure for the two buildings will be reduced by that amount.\n\nAs the Federal Government has recently given very careful attention to the question of improving the health of its Indian wards, and has voted a very considerable sum of money for this purpose, the Committee earnestly hopes that this comparatively small expenditure may be made possible next year through the provision of a hospital capable of meeting for many years to come, the medical requirements of the Indians in the Moose Factory and James Bay Settlements.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.B.R.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nDuring my interview with you on the 8th instant I mentioned the urgent need of a mechanical washing machine for our school at Moose Factory, and it is my recollection that I promised to submit a request to you for some help in securing this very necessary item of equipment. The smaller washers which have been in use have been found to be inadequate, and the Principal (Rev. Gilbert Thompson, B.A.) has submitted to our Commission the following recommendation:\n\nThe J. H. Connor & Sons Ltd., Ottawa, are willing to supply a \"No.1 M.W. Wood Tub Washer with counter shaft, electric motor and wringer. Capacity 36\", length over all 69\", height over all 66\". Price $10.00.\"\n\nMr. Thompson states that \"This is the smallest machine we could get if we are expected to work economically.\"\n\nWhile I am deeply conscious of the financial difficulties confronting your Department at the present time, I am regrettably obliged to state that the Government's decision to reduce the pupilage at the Indian Residential Schools to 92.5% from January 1st of last year, has made it impossible for our Society to meet\nall essential requirements such as this item of equipment out of their present income. Our difficulty has been further increased by the fact that the Society was obliged to install, at very great expense, a septic tank at this school and also to enlarge the intake pipe in connection with the water supply.\n\nShould your Department be unable to meet the total cost of the washing machine recommended by Mr. Thompson, I would earnestly hope that you may be able to make a generous grant towards the cost of the same.\n\nIn the list of sums provided in your Estimates for the current fiscal year, and as submitted in Departmental letter of June 30th last #160-2, I note that the sum of $300 is included for general repairs and painting at this school. I had hoped that some of this amount might still be available for the purchase of the washing machine, but the Principal wrote to me in August to say that a large part of this amount had already been used, and that the painting was essential to preserve the fabric of the main school building from deteriorating.\n\nA similar washing machine will be required for our Aklavit School but owing to lack of transportation consideration of this need may be deferred until next year.\n\nVery kind regards,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nOctober 29, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant with reference to a request that you have received for a new washing machine for the Moose Fort Residential School.\n\nAs you were previously advised, an amount of $300.00 was included in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Moose Fort School. We have had no communication from the Principal with regard to the expenditure which he advises you he has incurred. Consequently the $300.00 is still available. If you so desire I am prepared to recommend to the Minister that this amount be allowed to your Society toward the cost of the washing machine. I regret, however, that we cannot allow any larger amount than $300.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T.B.R.

This information should include the source of supply, its distance from the school, and bacteriological analyses of the water; also the type and capacity of the pumping unit, whether it is located in the school or in a separate pump house, and whether it is driven by a gasoline engine or an electric motor. It will also be necessary to know the voltage of the electric current available, if any, and if it is alternating current the frequency should be stated. The number of persons served should be given.\n\nKindly forward this information to the undersigned as soon as possible, so that the necessary specifications may be prepared.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nT.

That is the only cheque we have received, and I will be obliged if you will give the earliest attention you possibly can to the request embodied in our letter of the 24th inst. for the $300.00 due in connection with our Fort George School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa, July 8, 1942.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, the information given in my letter of July first was correct.\n\nI note that you refer to your letter of December 28, with which you enclosed accounts for supplies purchased at the Moose Fort Residential School. When these accounts reached the Department there was only $354.30 available from the amount provided in the 1941-42 appropriation for expenditures at the Moose Fort School. Consequently, we could only send a cheque for this sum instead of for the $500.00 previously mentioned. No doubt, you have received the latter cheque.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

There is a real need for this installation for there is no doubt that pollution of the Moose River will increase from year to year.\"\n\nYou will note from the above that Dr. Orford considers this installation necessary.

By instructions to obtain a complete report on the necessity for the installation and to secure concrete evidence of contamination of the Moose Port water supply were based upon information which was submitted by Departmental technical staff, and which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"However, before any further action is taken towards purchasing this equipment we would strongly recommend that some concrete evidence be submitted showing the source of supply (Moose river) to be contaminated. Samples of water should be forwarded here for bacteriological analysis, if such analyses have not already been made, and a sketch showing the location of the intake in relation to any sewer outlets or other possible sources of contamination should be submitted. The locality is remote from any large centres of population and it seems most unlikely that a river of this size would be sufficiently contaminated to require chlorination except under unusual local conditions. If such conditions do obtain, the Department should be informed of them.\"\n\nWill you please arrange to secure from Dr. Orford the desired information and samples of water or analysis of same.\n\nH.J.

Moore:\n\n\"I believe that there is sufficient endemic typhoid in the North to make it advisable to vaccinate the children in the Residential school. I believe that a small chlorinating machine such as you suggest should be installed.\"\n\nThe following is quoted from a letter dated February 9th, received from Mr. Hugh McIntyre, Provincial Sanitary Inspector:\n\n\"I think you have very good grounds for suspecting this source of supply for drinking water (Moose River) in view of the fact that all the sewage from Timmins, Iroquois Falls, Cochrane, Smoothrock Falls, Kapuskasing and Hearst goes into its tributaries. No doubt some considerable distance separates you from these sources of pollution but such steady and long continued pollution is bound to tell in the end, especially as the discharge of paper mill waste tends to kill off fish in these rivers. My opinion is that the river water should not be used unless boiled or chlorinated. I always understand the river water at Moose Factory is brackish, especially at high tide.\"\n\nThe following is quoted from a letter received from Dr. Moore dated February 11th:\nMoose Factory, Ont.,\nAugust 14th., 1942.\n\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.

Enclosed herewith is a copy of his reply, and I will be obliged if you will let me know at your earliest convenience if the grant of $500.00 (less the $25.00 already expended) may be used in providing the Septic tank suggested.\n\nNo order should be given for any of the materials listed, until further notice, as the total cost will greatly exceed the grant from your Department, and we must know how this is to be provided.\n\nIt will be a help to us in deciding whether the building of the tank is to be undertaken or not, if we know whether the grant (now $475.00) can be applied towards this purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary of the Commission.\n\nTBW:A.\nEnc.\nOttawa, August 24, 1942.\n\nRe: Repairs, Moose Factory Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 20th instant and also copy of a communication received by you from the Principal of the Moose Factory Residential School, sent forward therewith.\n\nIt has occurred to me that it might be advisable for you to send forward a list of the supplies needed for the construction of a septic tank at the school, to a value of approximately $500.00. These supplies in our case will have to be purchased in the regular way through our Purchasing Division. I am anxious that you should carefully note this fact because we have been reminded recently that owing to priority ratings all purchases must be made by our purchasing agent. It is just possible that difficulty may be experienced in securing a number of the articles included in the list supplied by Mr. Thompson.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A.

September 5, 1942.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am writing for the specific purpose of soliciting your help in enabling our Commission to retain at their Moose Factory School the services of Mr. John H. Long, the Engineer. In a letter just received from him he states that he had received a notice to report for medical examination and military training, and while he felt doubtful about being accepted for active service, there was a possibility that he might be taken for some form of service.\n\nThe Reverend Principal Thompson of our Moose Factory School, when writing to me in this connexion, stated that Dr. Crford had examined Mr. Long, and he thought that \"due to the foot defect he would probably be put in category 'C'.\"\n\nAs our Commission, since Canada entered into war, has released approximately fifty staff agents, or nearly one-third of all of their school staffs, they felt that in this way they have made a valuable contribution to the war effort by the finding of other men and women to take their place has imposed a very heavy burden on our Commission and especially on our office staff, and at the present time we have important staff vacancies which we are most anxious to fill. Half of the men who are engineers at our schools have enlisted, and if Mr. Long is taken away for any reason whatever, it may be months before we are able to secure anyone else to take his place. Principal Thompson is relying on him to supervise the installation of the septic tank referred to in your letter of August 24th last, #44-6-5, and I can assure you that any help you may be able to give us in arranging for Mr. Long to remain where he is will be fully appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa, September 8, 1942.\n\nRe: Engineer, Moose Park Residential School.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 3rd instant, in which you solicit our help in retaining the engineer at the above-noted school.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that a number of somewhat similar requests have reached this Branch since the outbreak of war. I regret to state, however, that under existing regulations it is not possible for the officials of this Branch to intervene, either directly or indirectly, in such matters. We have been informed that no exceptions can be made in regard to men called up for military training. It is just possible, of course, that in the case of Mr. Long his physical disabilities will be such that he will experience little difficulty in securing a release. In any event, we are powerless to take any action in cases of this nature.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend T.B.R.

This excess is referred to as \"Residual Chlorine\" and can be readily measured to determine that the correct amount of chlorine has been added.\n\nWhen a chlorine feed rate produces a residual higher than required, chlorine is being wasted and, of course, when the residual is less than that required, the desired result will not be obtained. In the interests of economy and proper chlorination, it is essential to adjust chlorine feed rates accordingly.\nProper adjustment of chlorination to meet the seasonal changes in chlorine requirement therefore demands a simple method of determining chlorine residual quickly and with laboratory accuracy.\n\nBecause it is simple, easily and quickly performed and because it requires no special chemical or technical training, the ortho-tolidin color comparison test is widely used for this purpose. Ortho-tolidin when added to water containing residual chlorine will develop a greenish yellow or orange color. The intensity of the color developed varies with the amount of residual chlorine present.\n\nTo meet the demand for an accurate, permanently reliable, yet inexpensive device for this color test, the W&T Junior Tester is of particular advantage where chlorination will be confined to narrow residual limits and where requirements do not warrant the purchase of standards for a complete range as furnished with the W&T Comparator.\n\nThis apparatus is furnished with either of two sets of standards. For drinking water chlorination it is customary to use the standards which show residuals of 0.1 parts per million and 0.3 parts per million. For swimming pools and applications where higher residuals are usually in order, a set of color standards for 0.2 p.p.m. and 0.5 p.p.m. is furnished. With either set of standards, it is an easy matter to interpolate the results of any test.\n\nDescription\n\nConsisting of a housing which is firmly supported on a broad base, the Tester is made of moulded plastic material which is durable, resistant to corrosion and not affected by either acids or alkalis. Two rectangular sample tubes fit into the housing, one for the sample being tested and the other for an untreated sample. By this means natural color and turbidity in the water are automatically compensated for and a true reading of residual is obtained. An even diffusion of light over the samples is assured by milk glass set in the back of the case. Non-fading, accurate color standards are built into the front of the case with the numbers which indicate the value of each standard. The standards are made of a carefully colored and accurately calibrated glass, permanently maintaining their reliability.\n\nOperating Procedure\n\nClean both tubes and fill to 10 cc. mark with water to be tested.\n\nTo one tube containing sample of water, add 0.5 cc of ortho-tolidin reagent, mix thoroughly and place in center compartment of test kit. Allow maximum color to develop\u2014which usually takes from 5 to 10 minutes.\n\nCompare developed color in center tube with glass color standards by placing untreated sample tube first in left hand compartment and then in right hand compartment of test kit. Residual values must be estimated if the developed color lies between the two color standards.\n\nGeneral\n\nSquare sample tubes provided with this Tester eliminate shadow interference and all color standards are calibrated for the 13 mm. depth of liquid and the quantities of water and reagent as indicated. It is essential that the correct sample tubes and color standards are used at all times with this kit.\n\nBefore taking readings be sure that the glass color standards, the sample tubes and the frosted glass in the back of the case are clean.\n\nNever test samples that have stood in sunlight as the color developed by ortho-tolidin will fade.\n\nCONVENIENCE\n\nRepresented in 32 convenient cities, a nationwide organization of Wallace & Tierman specialists in sanitary and industrial chlorination are ready to be of service. They are prepared to offer advice on any phase of the application of chlorine for any purpose.

LONDON, ENGLAND\nTHE W&T HYPOCHLORINATOR\n\nChlorination of the small water supply, whether public or private, where chlorine requirements are small and supervision limited, presents a distinct problem in the field of sanitation. Today, more than 85% of the country's domestic water supply is chlorinated but in many instances small supplies have been neglected due to the lack of suitable equipment. The W & T Hypochlorinator has been specifically designed to meet this need. Small in size, easily installed and requiring a minimum of operating supervision, it offers for the small supply the efficient protection of chlorination at the lowest possible cost.\n\nHow the W&T Hypochlorinator Operates\n\nThe Hypochlorinator consists essentially of a diaphragm pump constructed of corrosion resistant material and so designed that the rate of chlorine application may be easily adjusted to properly chlorinate the water flowing through a pipe line. The fundamental operating principle is outstanding from the standpoint of design and is exclusive with W & T Hypochlorinators. It consists in the use of a balanced diaphragm with a single suction valve and single discharge valve, solution being drawn into the diaphragm chamber on the suction stroke and forced out to the point of application on the discharge stroke. On the delivery side of the diaphragm the pressure is the same as that at the point of application. On the reverse side of the diaphragm, water under full main pressure is allowed to flow into the diaphragm chamber through a suitable control or balancing valve which confines this water and balances the diaphragm between equal pressures. Pumping is accomplished by application of an intermittent impulse which causes the diaphragm to reciprocate in a manner similar to a pump piston. This principle of operation gives extraordinarily long diaphragm life because of minimum strain on the diaphragm and, in addition, allows the pump to deliver a uniform volume of solution regardless of the water pressure encountered. Control of the pump may be effected either with a small electric motor or specially designed water driven element depending upon existing conditions at the point of application. Manual or semi-automatic (automatic start and stop) operation can be used on either electric or water driven type and a third type, water meter controlled, will automatically proportion the rate of chlorine supplied to the water flow. Hence, the W & T Hypochlorinator is readily adaptable to any small water supply whether it be a steady flow, a pumped supply with automatic start and stop, or a variable flow gravity supply.\nElectrically Operated Hypochlorinator\n\nThe Electrically Operated Hypochlorinator is particularly adaptable for use on small pumped water supplies operated either manually or by automatic start and stop of the pumping unit. The equipment is operated by water under pressure equal to or greater than that into which the chlorine solution is applied and operation is directed by means of a small electric motor.\n\nSince water pressure furnishes the major part of the power needed to operate the Hypochlorinator, the electric power required is greatly reduced and the small electric motor used consumes no more than 40 watts\u2014at ordinary rates, a cost for electricity averaging not over 6c. a day. Waste water is also reduced to a minimum and averages no more than a quarter of a gallon per minute.\n\nRate of chlorine application may be varied by changing the length of the pumping stroke or by the choice of either of two operating speeds, the total capacity range of the apparatus being 30 to 1. Motor and gears are entirely enclosed and operate in an oil bath\u2014hence there is no lubrication problem.\n\nThe Electrically Operated Hypochlorinator is designed to operate on any water pressure from 5 lbs. to 125 lbs. per square inch. For pressures below 5 pounds per square inch or where negative pressure exists at the point of application, a special electrically operated unit has been designed which operates entirely on electric power and has no water connections or fittings.\n\nWater Operated Hypochlorinator\n\nThe Water Operated Hypochlorinator uses only water pressure for operation, one flow being used to operate the balanced diaphragm and another flow controlling the operation. Since it is entirely independent of electric or external mechanical power it is particularly well adapted for emergency work, for standby or duplicate installation, or for any installation requiring a steady rate of chlorination. The equipment is operated by water under pressure equal to or greater than that into which the chlorine solution is applied, the minimum water pressure being 10 pounds per square inch and the maximum 125 pounds per square inch. By using the pilot principle of design wherein minute mechanical forces are able to operate the equipment with small quantities of water, the amount of waste water is reduced to a minimum and averages not more than one-half gallon per minute. Variation in rate of chlorine application is accomplished by changing the number of pumping strokes per minute and gives a 12 to 1 range. An important advantage of the W & T Water Operated Hypochlorinator lies in the fact that the suction stroke is extremely rapid, requiring only a small percentage of the running time and hence the rate of chlorine application is remarkably steady.\n\nAutomatic Hypochlorinator\n\nBecause of wide flow variations on small gravity water supplies, an automatic meter driven chlorinator of small capacity has long been in demand. The W & T Automatic Hypochlorinator fulfills the requirements for this type of installation in all respects. Operation is similar to the Manual Water Operated Hypochlorinator but the rate of pumping and hence the rate of chlorine application is directly controlled by a water meter installed in the main water line. Any type of meter in which a shaft turns in direct ratio to the flow of water through the meter may be used, and the chlorine applied will be at all times proportional to the water flow. Variation in treatment is accomplished by varying the length of stroke, for which purpose a control handle and dial are provided on the equipment. The accuracy of the W & T Automatic Hypochlorinator when used with small water meters is outstanding and is due to the important and exclusive principle of design wherein small mechanical power is required to activate the balanced diaphragm pump\u2014an advantage found only in W & T equipment.\n### Table of Specifications\n\n| SPECIFICATIONS                                      | Electric Types | Water Manual | Automatic |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|\n| Maximum chlorine capacity lbs. 24 hours            | HEMP           | HWM          | AHWM      |\n| Maximum volume pumped in 24 hours (gallons)        | 5              | 5            | 5         |\n| Ratio maximum to minimum volume of solution        | .60            | .60          | .60       |\n| C.C. solution per 1/2\" stroke                       | 14.2           | 14.2         | 14.2      |\n| Maximum allowable main pressure lbs./sq.in         | 125            | 125          | 125       |\n| Minimum allowable main pressure lbs./sq.in          | 5              | vacuum       | 10        |\n| Maximum normal water consumption g.p.m             | 6.3            | 10.3         | 0.4       |\n| Drain required                                     | yes            | yes          | yes       |\n| Maximum allowable solution strength                 | 1              | 1            | 1         |\n| Kind of electric current                           | A.C.           | none         | none      |\n| Maximum Watts consumed                             | 40             |              |           |\n| Transformer size                                   | 100 v.a        |              |           |\n| Relay controls                                     | 10 watts at 110 volt |              |           |\n| Strokes per minute                                 | 2 or 12        | 1 to 12      | maximum 12|\n| Length of electric cable                           | 10 ft          |              |           |\n\n### Short Specifications for W&T Hypochlorinator\n\n**TYPE:** The Chlorinator shall be a manually operated control of the Hypochlorinator from maximum to minimum.\n\n**METHOD OF CONTROL:** The Chlorinator shall be activated and controlled by means of a lever mounted on the side of the tank.

B. Kinney,\nManager.\nJanuary 28, 1943\n\nMemorandum:\n\nTHE PURCHASING AGENT\n\nThe Schools Branch has had some correspondence with you regarding the chlorinator for the Moose Port Indian Residential School water supply. A representative of Wallace & Tiernan, Ltd., Toronto, called here today and was seen by Mr. Phelan and myself. I believe that Wallace and Tiernan supply the majority of chlorinating apparatuses that are recommended by various Public Health officials. They are recognized specialists in this field. The outfit that they quoted on in their letter to you of October 19, of which I received a copy, would be the chlorinator that I would recommend for this school. The price quoted was $495.00 F.O.B., Mooseport.\n\nI am not quite sure whether it would be necessary to have a man go from Toronto to install it, but Father thinks that with suitable instructions, someone at Moose Factory would be able to make the installation. This Branch has forwarded previous evidence as to the necessity of putting in this chlorinator as the river water is unsafe to drink and on reports from the Department of Health, Toronto, has been graded unfit for human consumption.\n\nP. E. Moore, M.D., D.P.H.\nActing Superintendent of Medical Services\nOttawa,\nJanuary 30, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Chlorinating Plant, Moose Port Indian Residential School,\n\nIn memorandum of October 20, 1942, you were requested to take no further action with reference to the purchase of the above in view of the fact that we had already expended the major portion of the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new material at the above-mentioned school.\n\nAdditional information received regarding the necessity for a chlorinating plant at this school is reflected in Dr. Moore's memorandum of January 26 in which he strongly recommends the immediate purchase of this equipment.\n\nIn our current year's appropriation there is an amount of $1000.00 for maintenance of equipment at church-owned residential schools. It has not been found necessary to expend any of this amount and, if the purchase of the chlorinating plant is approved, it will no doubt be possible to transfer sufficient funds from the amount mentioned to the Moose Port School in order to provide the sum of $495.00 which is the cost of the chlorinating plant.\n\nR.A.

Orford, Indian Agent, Moose Factory, Ont.\n\nAs you know, the Moose Fort Residential School is a Church-owned building and we provide specific amounts for such buildings in our appropriation and are not allowed to exceed them. Other supplies purchased for the Moose Fort School during the past few months have practically exhausted the amount specifically provided for. As a consequence, we did not have funds for the chlorinating unit which you have recommended. However, we have found that we can transfer funds from another appropriation where the money was not required and consequently we have made further inquiries and are practically ready to make the purchase.\n\nThe information that we have received indicates that electric power is available and is 110 volts direct current. Is this information correct? If not, let me know the strength of the electric power available. It is very important that we should have specific information on this point as it affects the type of chlorinating unit which we will purchase.\n\nR.A.

On the 29th of October last, approval was granted for the purchase of this equipment from the Paterson Engineering Company of Canada, Ltd., Toronto, at a price of $325.00 f.o.b. Moosonee, Ont.\n\nIt is noted that you recommend the purchase of the higher priced equipment offered by Wallace and Tiernan, Ltd., Toronto, at $495.00. If the Wilson DES-O Pulsafeeder offered by the Paterson Company is not considered satisfactory, will you please advise in what respect it does not conform to the specifications prepared by the Surveys and Engineering Branch, or in what respects the Wallace and Tiernan product is sufficiently superior to warrant a difference of $169.00.\n\nI enclose herewith our complete file on this subject for your assistance. Please return same with your reply.\n\nH. A. Davidson,\nDept. Purchasing Agent.\nFebruary 25, 1943.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nTHAT the appropriation for the fiscal year 1942-43, Vote No. 167, Indian Affairs Branch, Mines and Resources, provides an amount of $1000.00 for maintenance of equipment at Church-owned Indian residential schools;\n\nTHAT part of the above amount is required for the purchase of a chlorinating plant at the Moose Fort Church of England Indian Residential School at a cost of $385.00;\n\nTHAT, as this building is Church-owned, the purchase of new equipment constitutes a grant and, therefore, the approval of Your Excellency in Council is desirable.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that approval be given for the expenditure at the above Indian residential school of the sum of $385.00, the same to be chargeable to Vote No. 167, 1942-43, Indian Affairs Branch, Mines and Resources.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nFebruary 23, 1948.\n\nPR\u00c9CIS FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL:\n\nApproval for the expenditure of $326.00 for purchase of a chlorinating plant at the Moose Fort Indian Residential School.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 23, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI enclose Memorandum to Council in connection with an amount of $386.00 required for the purchase of a chlorinating plant for the Moose Fort Indian Residential School.\n\nDr. Orford, Indian Agent, James Bay Indian Agency, and Dr. P.E. Moore, Acting Superintendent of Medical Services, recommend that a chlorinating plant be supplied immediately for the Moose Fort Indian Residential School, as the river water is unsafe to drink and reports received from the Department of Health, Toronto, indicate that this water has been graded unfit for human consumption.\n\nIn Vote 167, 1944-45, there is an amount of $1000.00 for maintenance of equipment at Church-owned Indian residential schools. It has not been found necessary to expend any of this amount. The sum provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Moose Fort Residential School has already been expended and consequently we are requesting authority to use an amount of $386.00 from the Item \"Maintenance of Equipment\" for the purchase of the new chlorinating plant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPP\nOttawa,\nFebruary 26, 1943.\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nI desire to refer to your memorandum of the last instant, with reference to the proposed purchase of a chlorinating plant for the Moose Fort C.M.

Our experience has been that it is virtually impossible to secure such a high rating unless the end use of the equipment has a definite relation to the war effort. In this connection I may state that one of your competitors offered to supply a suitable chlorinating outfit if we could procure a priority rating of A-1-J or better.\n\nIn view of the above, will you please advise if it is not possible to obtain the required equipment with a lower rating than AAS. Otherwise we may be obliged to consider cancellation of our order.\n\nYou state in your tender of Sept. 10, 1942, that the unit is constructed of 60% Canadian goods. Would it not be possible for you to obtain the parts made in U.S.A. by means of a P.R.P. application.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.J.

Lee.\n\nAt that time U.S. priority ratings were required from purchasers of equipment but the situation has now changed and we as a Canadian manufacturer operating under the Controlled Materials Plan, may ship to essential users without the necessity of obtaining priority ratings.\n\nIt was my understanding at the time of our discussion referred to above that we would probably be favoured with a purchase order covering one of our Hypochlorinators as quoted on by our letter of Oct. 19, 1942.\n\nMay we assure you of our desire to be of the best possible service.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nWALLACE & TIERMAN LIMITED.\n\n(Sgd.) J.B.

In the current year's appropriation it was only found possible to include an amount of $500.00 for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Moose Fort School and, as this is a Church-owned school, we are only allowed to expend the amount specifically provided. We have already purchased equipment for the installation of a chlorinator at a cost of $43.00 and this leaves a balance of $457.00 available. As this is all we can spend, we are requesting the Departmental Purchasing Agent to order the 200 bags of cement and the 400' of 6\" vitrified tile. The school management will have to be responsible for the balance of the material.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. G.

You may recall that I have written about this point before. Our batteries will not hold up for any length of time which means our Delee has to run longer hours and thus consumes more gas, etc. I wrote R.G. Stevens asking him to quote me on a new set of batteries which he says have a little larger capacity than our present set and which he thinks would be better for us since our load has increased somewhat. This set he quotes at $799.50 F.O.B. Moosonee. The set he recommends are KXO-17 batteries\".\n\nIn your letter referred to above you advised the sum of $500.00 was available and the Commission have instructed me to ask if the Department will secure the batteries Mr. Thompson requests, and allow the Commission to pay the balance, in order that the most necessary item of equipment may be supplied. If it is more convenient the Commission can purchase the batteries and present a request for a refund of $500.00 from the Department.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you and to know if the Department will approve this arrangement.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary-Treasurer.\nOttawa,\nDecember 16, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Moose Fort Indian Residential School\n\nThe above-mentioned Church-owned school is operated under the auspices of the M.S.C.C.

Cook,\nPrincipal.\n\nMoose Factory,\nOntario.\n\nJuly 28th., 1945.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nMoose Factory, Ont.,\n\nDear Dr. Orford:\n\nBy all appearances the present accommodation for school children in the Residential School is not going to be sufficient for our needs this coming term. The children of the village are coming to school in increasing numbers and we have decided that it will be necessary to reopen the building known as the old day school. This building can be converted easily into an adequate school but desks and a few furnishings are needed. I have enclosed a formal requisition which I hope meets with your approval. If you think fit it would be of considerable help if you could requisition for enough wall board to cover the ceiling. The building at present is of the very high roof variety and would take a lot of fuel to heat properly. The size of the roof or ceiling surface would be 45' by 30' and a sufficient number of 2 by 4's to be used for studding would be needed also.\n\nYour early attention to this matter would be appreciated as time for school reopening is not far distant.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nOttawa, August 1st, 1946.\n\nDr. T.J. Orford, Indian Agent, Moose Factory via Moosonee, Ontario.\n\nI am in receipt of Reverend Ock's letter of July 28th and your requisition of July 34th requesting additional desks, etc., for the Moose Port School. In view of the very small attendance at this school in the past it is difficult for us to understand why such a large number is expected for the coming year. Are the new pupils entering as Residential school pupils or are they simply coming as day school pupils? As you know arrangements have been previously completed for the operation of a day school for the summer months only. When replying you might let me know the number and type of desks at present in this school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nfor P. Phelan, Esq.\n\nLetter to Dr. Orford from Archdeacon Cook, dated Sept. 12th, 45 at Moose F.\n\nDear Dr. Orford\n\nI am now in a position to give you the information asked by Mr. Phelan in his letter to you of August first.\n\nAt the moment there are eighty children in residence at the Horden School. From the village each day an additional fifty come in for classes. This latter increase is a direct result of the family allowance policy of compulsory school attendance.\n\nWe are using now two class rooms with the following desk installed.\n\nGlobe #2 size 28 desks\nGlobe #3 size 34 desks\nGlobe #5 size 30 desks\n\nThis gives us a total of ninety-two desks.\n\nIt is our wish to open another class-room to accommodate the increased registration. This increase was anticipated some months ago in our requisition of July 24th.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd.) Henry G.

G.R. Turner,\n\nCol. B.F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nAs you are aware, following the typhoid epidemic at the above school in the fall of 1947, Mr. A. H. Perry, Supervising Engineer, Department of National Health and Welfare, carried out a thorough investigation of conditions there and submitted a comprehensive report. I quote from this report as follows:\n\n\"Improvements - Sewage Systems, Anglican Mission\n\nThe present system of sewage disposal is entirely unsatisfactory and ever present menace to the safety of the Moose River water as well as creating a public health nuisance and menace from flies, etc., to the Indian tenting on camp ground in front of the Mission.\n\nWith the proposed construction of a new hospital imminent it would appear advisable to construct a small sewage treatment plant capable of handling the sewage from the hospital and other immediate buildings, as well as from the Anglican Mission. An Ishoff tank design would be recommended with proper disposal of the effluent away from the river and such as not to endanger the safety of the under-ground water.\n\nIt was in the local papers a few days ago that the construction of a new hospital at Moose Factory is now assured and that building operations are to start during the coming spring. I understand that this new hospital will be located on property immediately adjacent to the Bishop Horden Memorial School.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, it is requested that action be taken, as recommended by Mr. A. H. Perry, to carry the sewage from the Bishop Horden Memorial School to the sewage disposal plant provided for the new hospital.\n\n(over)\nMay I suggest that approval of this request may be facilitated by the fact that we have been advised by your Deputy Minister, under date of 16th January, 1948, that provision for the purchase of this School has been made in the estimates submitted by your Department for 1948-49.\n\nMay we be advised, please, at your earliest convenience, of the action taken on this request regarding disposal of sewage from our school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Acting Superintendent.\n(absent on duty.)\nJanuary 26, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nYou will recall that Mr. Perry, of the Department of National Health and Welfare, recommended that a common sewage disposal system be used by the Moose Fort Residential School and your new Hospital at Moose Factory.\n\nIt is our intention, if funds are provided, to purchase this school from the M. S. O. C. Therefore, we are concerned over the provision of an adequate sewage disposal system. Would it be possible to install a sewage disposal system at the hospital, which would also look after our school needs.\n\nI would appreciate your referring this matter to your engineers, if you concur in such action.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nYou will recall that Mr. Perry, of the Department of National Health and Welfare, recommended that a common sewage disposal system be used by the Moose Fort Residential School and your new Hospital at Moose Factory.\n\nIt is our intention, if funds are provided, to purchase this school from the M.S.C.C.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, Ontario  \nJanuary 29, 1948\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Neary  \nre: Sewage Disposal System, Moose Factory\n\nI think it would be quite possible to arrange to have the sewage from the Moose Port Residential School disposed of through the sewage system to be installed for the hospital. We would expect the Indian Affairs Branch to finance this, plus any additional costs involved through any larger system needed.\n\nI will bring this to the attention of the Department of Public Works to find out just what would be involved.\n\nP. E. Moore, M.D., D.P.H.  \nDirector  \nIndian Health Services\nOttawa, January 30, 1948.\n\nDear General Turner:\n\nUpon receipt of your letter of January 21, I referred this matter to Doctor Moore of the Indian Health Services. I have now received a reply from him reading as follows:\n\n\"I think it would be quite possible to arrange to have the sewage from the Moose Fort Residential School disposed of through the sewage system to be installed for the hospital. We would expect the Indian Affairs Branch to finance this, plus any additional costs involved through any larger system needed.\n\nI will bring this to the attention of the Department of Public Works to find out just what would be involved.\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMajor General C.R. Turner,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank St.,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr. Breult:\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch has requested that we give consideration to allowing the sewage from the Indian Residential School at Moose Factory to be disposed of through the sewage disposal system of the hospital.\n\nMr. A. H. Perry of the Public Health Engineering Branch inspected the present sewage disposal system in the residential school last year when there was an outbreak of typhoid fever and made this recommendation.\n\nWe would expect the department of Mines and Resources to be responsible for any additional costs involved. It may also be possible to request Indian Affairs Branch to bear a share of the costs of the powerhouse construction. Possibly next year's Estimates will be soon enough to ask them for funds regarding this.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. E. Moore, M.D., D.P.H.\nDirector\nIndian Health Services\n\nC.

About mid-April, this Administration was informed that due to an oversight the placing of the order had been overlooked but that the matter would be rectified. In checking with our Principal, we find that, although he has received a copy of the Purchase Order, no delivery of the extractor has been made as yet.\n\nWould you please do what you can to have this piece of laundry equipment delivered to the school as soon as possible? Its installation before cold weather sets in would do much to overcome inadequate drying space in the laundry.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\n\nDictated but not personally signed because of absence from the office.\nJuly 16, 1948.\n\nJ.H.

Neary  \nSupt. of Welfare & Training  \nIndian Affairs ~ranch  \nDepartment of Mines & Resources  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\n1948-49 Appropriation  \nMoose Factory Anglican Indian Residential School\n\nI have your 44-6-5(E.1) dated 24th September, 1948, advising me that you have no funds for paying the accounts for labour on painting forwarded you with my letter of 13th September, 1948, because you have already over-expended the $1000.00 provided in this year's estimates on sports equipment, extractor, paint and bricks.\n\nI must say that this has come as a most unwelcome surprise because in your 44-6-5(E.1) of 5th March, 1948, you informed me that you were endeavouring to arrange for the transfer of $1000.00 from an unexpended 1947-48 appropriation at Whitefish Lake to Moose Factory to pay for the extractor and for as much paint as the balance would permit.\n\nIn your 160-2 (W.T.1) of 16th January 1948, you advised me that the sum of $2661.27 remained unexpended in your 1947-48 appropriations for Anglican Church-owned Schools\u2014Fort George $66.14, Wabasca $83.61, Whitefish Lake $1,211.52 and Carcross $600.00, but against this was an over-expenditure of $240.17 at Aklavit. This left a net uncommitted balance at that date of $2421.10 and you will recollect that arrangements were made with you to expend this on the undermentioned Schools as follows:\n\nCarcross  \nKerosene refrigerator  \nStorm Sash  \nWabasca  \nKitchen range  \nSports Equipment\nColonel B.F. Neary  \nSept. 27, 1948\n\nMoose Factory\n\nI understand that the refrigerator and storm sash for Carcross cost $425.00 and $260.00 respectively. I have no figures on your expenditure for the range and sports equipment for Wabasso, but allowing a reasonable amount for this, it would seem to me that there should have been a substantial balance in the 1947-48 appropriations (after the expenditures were made at Carcross and Wabasso) to apply towards the requirements at Moose Factory which you now tell me are being, or have been, paid from 1948-49 appropriations.\n\nIn order that I may have details for our records, will you please advise me on what the balance of $2421.10 mentioned in your 160-2 (WT1) of 16th Jan. 1948, was expended.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nOctober 26, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Neary,\n\nI am returning, herewith, blue prints forwarded by you to this office of the Indian School at Moose Factory, Ontario.

This building is of frame structure, set up on mud sills and will require a considerable amount to repair and renovate. In making a fair guess Mr. Monette claims that this would require more than Thirty Thousand dollars, and if the school is being taken over by the Department, I would suggest that extensive repairs and alterations be held until that time.\n\n(a) Installation of wall-mounted refrigeration would cost approximately $2,500. As this would require freezing and deodorizing unit, also cork board insulation and tar composition. The location as to where this unit will be placed and the position of same will depend largely upon the insulation costs.\n(b) Water Supply\nThe School is situated a considerable distance from hospital site and water pipes would have to be sunk at least six feet to clear of the frost. It would require a six inch water main and a house fitted with pump to hold pressure. With the installation of water system consideration would have to be given to the setting up of plumbing fixtures, etc., at strategic points for future necessary equipment.\n\n(b) Sewage System\nSewage system throughout school is in very poor condition and to do a proper job it may be necessary to rip this out and replace which no doubt would be a costly business. To connect sewage with hospital site would require a 10\" or 12\" main of vitrified tile and may involve the installation of thrasher pump. I hesitate to make an estimate on the installation of both water and sewage systems but feel that this would cost at least $16,000.\n\n(c) Toilet for Staff\nThe installation of a three piece toilet, with floor added, would cost approximately $250 assuming, of course, that this can be set up adjacent to the present latrines.\n\n(d) Fire Escape\nIt would not be advisable to have a fire escape of timber construction unless it were of the chute type. Letal stairs would be more appropriate and would cost very little more. An allowance of $300 Two hundred Dollars should be made for this.\n\n(e) Insulation of Attic\nAmount of Two Hundred Dollars quoted for insulation attic would be about enough for area required.\n\n(f) Interior Painting\nEstimate of Two Hundred Dollars $200 would barely cover materials for this and it is suggested that another Four Hundred Dollars $400 be added for labor.\nSummary of above Estimate\n\n(a) Walk-in Refrigerator ........................................ $2,500.\n(b) Water Supply and Sewage .................................... $15,000.\n(c) Bathroom for Staff ........................................... $250.\n(d) Fire Escape ...................................................... $200.\n(e) Insulation of Attic .............................................. $100.\n(f) Interior Painting ................................................ $100.\n\nAdd for unforeseen expenditure such as repair to foundation and other buildings $5,000.\n\nTotal . . $24,150.\n\nJ.S. Allan,\nSuperintendent\nJames Bay Indian Agency\nMoose Factory, Ont.,\nNov. 11, 1948\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttention Col. B. Leary\nRes Estimates 1949-50\nVote 516 - Schools\n\nIn the past few months I have had Loose Fort School under close observation and find that the boys are apparently running loose owing to the lack of proper educational facilities. This school has over 91 residential pupils and 35 day pupils.\n\nI have discussed this situation with Mr. Taylor and he advises that he has neither the staff nor the school rooms to accommodate the number of pupils on a full time basis. Nearly all the children are on half day basis and I understand that this has been the practice for several years.\n\nDuring my recent survey of the James Bay lands I had several complaints from the Indians claiming that their children were not receiving sufficient education for the time that they are spending at Loose Factory. The fault in this case does not lie with Mr. Taylor but is merely a case of overcrowding.\n\nYou will notice that in my Estimates I have made an allowance of Twenty Thousand Dollars for a Day School which would be incorporated with the set-up of new Indian Village which I hope to have under way next summer. The problem at Loose Fort School is that we have over 35 pupils of non-indian status and it would seem next to\nimpossible to eliminate these children from the privileges extended to the Indian. It has occurred to me that if we were to establish a day school on the Island we might be able to arrange a reciprocal agreement with the Provincial Government to take care of the Indian children which is out an equal amount to the Boosonee side and we could provide for the white children at this end in our School.\n\nJ.

The cost of building and of boilers is not included, it being assumed as a proper charge in total to the hospital. The cost of standby equipment is not included. Since it is assumed the school loads will not be of a nature requiring continuous service.\n\n(1) Capacity of initial installation of generating plant to suit maximum demand of hospital.\n\n(2) Capacity required by School - 10 K.W.\n\nProportion of (2) to (1) .05 or 5 percent\n\n(3) Cost of steam turbine equipment and two 100 K.W. generators for normal operation - $43,070.04\n\n(4) Proportion of (3) chargeable to School\n\n\\[ \\frac{0.05}{100} \\times 43,070.04 = 2,153.50 \\]\n\n(5) In addition there will be distribution line and transformer required to connect school to the generating plant.\n\n(6) Estimated school share of cost of (5) - $ 600.00\n\n(7) Total Capital Expenditure -\n\nChargeable to School (4) and (6).\n\nIt is suggested that energy supplied to the school be metered and suitable energy charges determined to cover proportionate costs of operation and maintenance of the generating and distributing equipment as chargeable to the school.\n\nIt is recommended that arrangements be completed with Department of Mines and Resources to have the school load connected to the generating plant of the hospital by reason of the following considerations:\n\n...........\n(1) The school is located in close proximity to the hospital and it seems desirable to reduce duplication of equipment as well as staff required to operate and maintain the equipment.\n\n(2) The estimated amount chargeable to the school is less than a separate and suitable generating plant with a building to house it, would cost.\n\nJOLW:MO\n\nJ.

Therefore, we would appreciate an indication from you as to which of the above buildings you wish to have included in the sale and also whether you consider the above prices acceptable to your organization.\n\nIt will also be necessary to arrive at a valuation for the furniture and equipment in the buildings and the property on which they are located. Therefore, I would ask that your Principal would prepare an inventory at this school listing the types of equipment and the value set thereon.\n\nWith regard to the land, it will be necessary for you to produce the usual proof of ownership so that the transfer\ncan be arranged. You should also indicate the value set by you on this property.\n\nIn a covering letter the Deputy Minister of Public Works makes the following observations about the buildings:\n\n\"Your attention is drawn to the following:\nThe well and pump house which supply water to these buildings also supply water to other buildings which your Department does not propose to purchase; the electrical plant supplies power to the various buildings, also supplies power to other buildings in the area which your Department is not proposing to purchase. This is drawn to your attention so that you will be able to make arrangements for the continued operation of both the pump house equipment and electrical generating equipment, and that the costs of supplying power to buildings other than those which you may eventually own can be adjusted.\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nDepartment of Public Works, Canada\nCHIEF ARCHITECT'S BRANCH\n\nOTTAWA, March 4, 1949\n\n28926\n\nB.F.

Clark\n\n[Signature]\n\nBF $5\nE 3/1\nMoose Factory, Ont.,\nMarch 15, 1949.\n\nSuperintendent of Education:\n\nMoose Fort Residential School:\n\nAs of noon today seventy pupils were confined to bed with influenza. Some of the staff are affected and off duty. Classroom activities have been suspended. There are numerous cases of the ailment in the non-school population. The fire last Saturday destroyed a large part of the drugs necessary for treatment, but emergency supplies have been obtained.\n\nThe lay-out of the school does not lend itself to convenient isolation and care of the sick.\n\nTo begin with, the dormitories are populated well beyond the limit indicated in Departmental regulations. In the girls' dormitory there is one basin with taps and one flush toilet. In the boys' dormitory there was a like installation, but the toilet has been out of order for a long time.\n\nFood has to be carried from the basement kitchen up two stories, and there is not, of course, a supply of trays adequate for such an emergency with the natural result that there is a good deal of inconvenience and considerable mess.\n\nThe situation affords a pathetic contrast with the infirmary at Prince Albert which has flexible accommodation for both sexes, adequate plumbing, and a convenient dispensary; also equipment and other provision for serving food at the proper temperature.\n\nIt has been in my mind for some time to recommend that the Moose Fort Residential School restrict its activities to those of a hostel, and that a separate building be provided for classroom purposes and recreational, physical and vocational training. There is a growing population on this island, both Indian and non-Indian, which already overtaxes the day school accommodation which the Moose Fort buildings can provide.

I am not sure in which of these parcels the above mentioned buildings are situated. The value of the actual land occupied is now under consideration.\n\nWith reference to the concluding paragraph of your letter re the power and water supply for those buildings which we shall retain, we feel that the cost of this continued service could readily be adjusted on the spot.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL. A. Dixon.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMAJOR CLARK\n\nWould you please take this file over to the Reserves and Trusts Division and find out from them the parcel of property on which the school is situated.\n\nCould you also advise whether we should purchase the two parcels.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard P. Henry,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION:\n\nPurchase of Land at Moose Fort:\n\nReference is to your memorandum of April 1st and to Canon Dixon's letter of March 28.\n\nIt appears that the Canon should get further information concerning this land and his legal position as a would-be tenant.\n\nParcel 1653 is a \"God's Half Acre\" on which stands the parish church. I have been told that this church is not for sale.\n\nParcel 1653 takes in 113.14 acres and contains the buildings and grounds in which this Department is interested. It also contains the ground upon which National Health and Welfare are building a large hospital. Our agencies division wants a piece of land for an office.\n\nThe title (such as it is) to the land is vested in the Bishop of Moosonee, but title is forfeited if he tries to sell it or convey it. It perplexes me to understand how the M.S.C.C. can assume the role of vendor. The Hudson's Bay Company has reserved that right, and until negotiations between the Government and the Hudson's Bay Company are completed we shall be unable to find a legal vendor for the part of parcel 1653 which this Branch should acquire.\n\nIt might be as well to tell Canon Dixon that the M.S.C.C. need not expect any compensation for the land and that, therefore, they need not give further attention to its value.\n\nC.A.H.Clark\nMemorandum\n\nB. F. Neary, Superintendent of Education,\nRes Moose Factory Island.\n\nThis will confirm Mr. Clark's recent enquiry as to the status of Moose Factory Island and the lands thereon which the Bishop of Moosonee is to receive from the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nAs we advised you verbally, the matter of the transfer of portions of the Island to both this Department and the Bishop of Moosonee by the Hudson's Bay Company is being held up pending the registration of the survey plan and although the original plan was forwarded to the said Company last January for certification as to ownership, it has not been returned by the Company, and insofar as we are aware, has not been registered. Until registration is effected, it is not possible for the Hudson's Bay Company to register the proposed conveyances to this Department and to the Bishop of Moosonee, and we are therefore in the position of awaiting action by the said Company.\n\nMr. Clark was particularly concerned as to whether the lands to be conveyed to the Bishop of Moosonee would be subject to a condition preventing the said Bishop from disposing of any part thereof without the consent of the Hudson's Bay Company. It was pointed out to him that in all likelihood, such a condition would be attached to the grant but that we had no definite knowledge of this, nor would have, as the point in question concerned only the Hudson's Bay Company and the Bishop of Moosonee. It is my understanding that you are anxious to acquire for school purposes a small portion of the land which will be conveyed to the Bishop of Moosonee, and if this is correct certainly any negotiations between yourself and the Bishop of Moosonee should receive the approval of the Hudson's Bay Company.\nAs any transfer of part of the Bishop of Moosonee's land would require further survey work to determine the exact boundaries, I would suggest that your proposed transaction be kept separate and apart from the present transaction where we are acquiring a large portion of the Island. By that, I mean that if this proposed acquisition of further land was to be dealt with in the series of conveyances presently under consideration, it would mean more survey work this summer and would require the preparation of a new plan to take the place of that presently being considered for registration.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. J.

Allan) and myself. Mr. Allan, however, was not present for the evaluating of the farm machinery and horses which are offered without, apparently, barns or buildings to house them, and their utility is on that account, at least, open to question.\n\nSimilarly, as there is little prospect of resuming the keeping of milch cows, certain items of dairy equipment appear to be surplus to requirements here.\n\nThe power plant has, I understand, already been appraised by a representative of the Department of Public Works. From what I know of electric batteries I would judge that some cells are about ready to collapse and that all will require early replacement.\n\nThe value set on the boat L.S. \"Adventure\" might well be the subject of further negotiation.\n\nThe X-ray equipment will likely become unnecessary here when the hospital presently under construction nearby is ready to function.\n\nA copy of this memorandum is being furnished to Mr. Supt. Allan together with a copy of the inventory (as amended to Feb. 26th). The Principal has a copy of the inventory.\n\nArchdeacon Clarke told me that the Church is to retain title to the barns.\n\nC.A.F. Clark\n\nC.A.F.

Cheshire,\nGeneral Manager, Fur Trade Department,\nHudson's Bay Company,\nHudson's Bay House,\nMain Street, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nMoose Factory -\n\nDear Mr. Cheshire:\n\nI understand that Mr. Brown of the Reserves and Trusts Division of this Department discussed recently with Mr. Wilcox of your company our proposals with regard to Moose Factory Island.\n\nMr. Brown has advised me that apparently you were not aware that the Department intended to purchase the Moose Fort Indian Residential School from the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada. In order to clarify our plans in this regard, I am sending you a copy of a letter sent to your company on April 22, 1949.\n\nOn the enclosed plan of Moose Factory Island we have indicated approximately that portion of parcel A which it is considered will be essential to the operation of the school. It is our understanding that the Anglican Church authorities of the Missionary Society are quite prepared to transfer the use of this area and it is suggested that such transfer could be carried out with the various transfers which will be necessary in the change of ownership of various portions of the island. In your letter of February 6, 1948, you outlined briefly the various proposals as regards transfers of various parcels and in \"(a)\" you stated that you would request the Bishop of Moose Cree to transfer to you the parcel of 113.14 acres excepting parcel A.\n\nIt is suggested that if you agree to the proposal that the Missionary Society sell these school buildings and give up its use to the land required for the operation of such school, that \"a\" above would be amended by the Bishop of Moose Cree transferring to the Hudson's Bay Company the parcel of 113.14 acres excepting therefrom only that portion\nof parcel A which the school or Society would be retaining after selling the school to this Department.\n\nAs your company has not expressed its approval of the intention of the Missionary Society to transfer the school and required lands to this Department, I shall be very pleased to learn whether the company has any objection to the proposal and if not whether you consider the transfer of the land could be carried out as above suggested. It is of course understood that before any actual transfer of the land could be made we would have parcel A subdivided to show the respective portions which would be transferred to this Department and retained by the Missionary Society.\nMoose Factory Hospital\n\nThis aerial view of Moose Factory Island on the Moose River a few miles from James Bay shows the location site of the new $2,000,000 hospital with the building of the hospital in the background. Moose Factory is one of the largest reserves in Ontario, dating back to 1873. The hospital, being built by the federal government, will serve about 900 Indians who live in the James Bay area hunting and trapping. Tuberculosis has been a great killer in that region, and one of the aims of the new hospital will be to reduce the tragic TB toll among the Indians.\n\nThis picture gives a better idea of the distances if it becomes necessary to get water from the hospital plant.\n\nI think you will find a report about water for this school on one of the DAY school files.\n\nThe building with the red mark is the main school building. The shore line to the right is just a little out of the picture.\nReceived from Horse for School\n$60.00\n\nNightwatchman - $60.00\n\nSunshine Cheechoo\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: Indian Schools Administration\n\nAddress: 102 Bank Street, Ottawa, Ont.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 3 Dec 49 | To hire of night watchman at Moose Fort Residential School, Moose Factory, Ont., for month of November as per attached receipt | $60.00 |\n\nVote 516\n\nAllotments 01-819\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

This condition was discovered by the medical officer and subsequently rectified but illustrates the hazards to which surface sources of water supply are usually exposed.\n\nThe placement of a water supply intake in this area in relation to points of sewage discharge is of no value due to the action of the tides which reverse the flow of the river; although the Island is twelve miles from James Bay the effect of the tide is felt farther as it might happen, another twenty miles upstream from Moose Factory. The salt water contamination of the river is very slight and the effect of an incoming tide is to back up the fresh water and cause a reversal of flow. Thus, it would be quite impossible to locate a water intake upstream from any sewer outfall.\n\nThe range of the diurnal tides is from 5 to 7 feet but this may vary considerably depending on the velocity and direction of the wind. As stated previously the Mission's water intake is located in a cross-channel with reverse flows induced by either the wind or the tide or a combination of both.\n\nBACTERIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF WATER\n\nIn searching through the local files of the Indian Agent only a few copies of laboratory reports could be found covering bacteriological analyses of the river water and other sources. However, other correspondence in the files revealed that other specimens had been obtained from time to time and reference was made to the high incidence of fecal contamination usually prevalent in the Moose River water.\n\nA number of water specimens from various sources were collected by the undersigned at the time of visit and the laboratory report on these are appended to this memorandum.\n\nANIMAL FACTORY - ANIMAL SEWAGE\n\nSurrounding the school building are four septic tanks. One concrete tank serving four (4) flush toilets, one steel tank serving one (1) flush toilet, one steel tank serving two (2) flush toilets and one concrete tank serving the small hospital all discharge to a common point. Laundry, sink and bathtub wastes bypass the septic tanks and also discharge to a common point.\n\nThe arrangement to dispose of the septic tank effluents and other liquid wastes was formerly a four inch sewer composed of unplanned field tile which was laid for a distance of approximately 2,000 feet into a shallow depression in the bottom of the creek. Apparently this sewer was not laid in a straight line or with sufficient slope, so in any event, its course became plugged and overflowed elsewhere. In the late fall of 1946 much of the tile was dug up and reclaimed. It was then laid in the opposite direction, easterly towards the river and new discharges just under the river bank in front of the school creating a foulness and nuisance. The effluent finds its way into a low swampy area where it mingle with the overflows from a small pond and discharges into the Moose River at a point which is only 50 feet from the water supply intake.\n\nThus, sewage may readily reach the water supply intake. The facts that the water supply system was being inadequately treated by chlorination, that the sewer outfall location had been changed within the past year and that the outbreak of disease had begun during this time, progressing to a total of ten cases, all combine to throw suspicion on the water supply and indicate it to be the mode of transmission of the infective organism. So far, the epidemiological work conducted has not detected an actual typhoid carrier although it is probable that a carrier has been present.\n\ncontinued........\nIn connection with the proposed construction of an Indian Hospital (130) both preliminary bore hole reports to determine availability of water supply have already been made by Pauline Barton, Mr. Superintendent, District Engineer of Public Works. It was found that a water table existed on the Island at a distance of about 6.2 feet below the surface and that there appeared to be little danger of contamination from the river water. One test well was put down in the new hospital site but no pumping tests have yet been run nor has the work progressed far enough to have analyses made.\n\nA new well is being dug beside the pumping house for an alternative source of supply for the school. Also a new well is being dug by the Indian Agent, which will have a small pumping system with a public tap from which Indians may draw water.\n\nWith ground water available it would appear advisable to abandon the Moose River as a source of drinking and culinary water for the Island.\n\nUntil pumping tests are run on individual wells it is not possible to say whether sufficient water would be available for all purposes. It may be that a separate system from the river for fire protection and possibly laundering, would be required.\n\nWhether the developed wells would require treatment to render the water safe for drinking purposes could only be determined after a series of analyses, both chemical and bacteriological.\n\nThe present system of sewage disposal is entirely unsatisfactory and over present menace to the safety of the Moose River water as well as creating a public health nuisance and menace from flies, etc., to the Indian tenting on camp ground in front of the Mission.\n\nWith the proposed construction of a new hospital incinerator it would appear advisable to construct a small sewage treatment plant capable of handling the sewage from the hospital and other immediate buildings, as well as from the Anglican Missionaries. An embankment design would be recommended with proper disposal of the effluent away from the river and such as not to endanger the safety of the underground water.\n\nGENERAL SANITATION OF SETTLEMENT\n\nThe general sanitation is very poor. Accumulations of garbage, tin cans and rubbish litter the banks in front of the settlement and are very offensive around many of the Indian houses. This condition creates excellent fly-breeding facilities with their attendant public health menace. There should be some type of garbage collection system but as this is unorganized territory in the Province of Ontario the supervision of these matters would come under the Ontario Health Department.\n\nThe absence of sewage disposal facilities for this bulk of the Indian houses has been referred to previously. It is understood that the Hudson's Bay Company is proceeding with the installation of a pumped water supply system opposite town, and a tile drainage field. The latter would be a tremendous although still primitive, if properly maintained would be sufficient to meet cases where there is no piped water under pressure available.\n\nWATER SUPPLY RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. It is recommended that the Moose River, in view of the sewage contamination known to exist, be discontinued as a source of drinking and culinary water supply for the Anglican School and that underground water in which a shallow well is now being dug be used for this purpose.\n\ncontinued.........\n1. Whether chlorination of the ground water from the mill would be advisable or not can only be determined after a series of bacteriological analyses.\n\n2. For the present it is recommended that all water drawn from this river for drinking purposes should be boiled before use.\n\n3. The river water could be used for fire protection purposes in the event there is not enough water available from the well for all purposes. Adequate precautions would have to be taken to prevent cross-contamination and two physically separate water systems would be required.\n\n4. The existing hypochlorinator could be adapted to treat water from the new well, if required. Pipings for the water supply connection to the hypochlorinator should be changed and made direct from the pressure side of the tank. The other defects pointed out in the section dealing with the water supply should be corrected.\n\n5. If the principle is followed of prohibiting the use of the Moose River for drinking purposes, raw or treated, and using developed ground water and wells on the Island, then sewage could be run into the river. However, this proposal would require the approval of the Ontario Health Department.\n\n6. It is recommended that some treatment of the sewage be carried out. A single sewage treatment plant to take care of the new hospital as well as the Anglican Mission could be located in a central area. The type of treatment plant could be similar to the Rideau Health and Occupational Center (D.V.A.), near Ottawa, employing an Ishoff tank, sludge drying beds and chlorination of the effluent. The latter could be disposed of into the Moose River without nuisance.\nThe operator stated that the residual chlorine was measured only once a month. The river water contains a high amount of color together with organic matter and may have a relatively high and seasonal variation owing to increased vegetation coming down following spring break-up. Also there may be local variations due to contamination from sewage getting into the river above the intake. Consequently the chlorine added to the water should be tested daily for free chlorine and a continuous daily record maintained.\n\nThe comparator supplied with the hypochlorinator for testing free chlorine is of a type which is difficult for even experienced operators to read. It had not been used for some time as it was covered with dust. The operator had been using a clean test tube in making the tests. It is quite possible that a false reading may have been taken on the occasions when the tests were made, due to two causes. First the orthotolidine reagent being used was over three years old and had become discolored. This solution rapidly deteriorated after it has been prepared and should be renewed every two or three months. The river water is highly coloured and these two qualities may combine to give a color reaction even when no free chlorine is present. A bottle of freshly prepared orthotolidine was left with the operator.\n\nThe chlorine solution used to feed the hypochlorinator was being made from chloride of lime which is very unstable. As this compound contains at least from 25 to 35% free chlorine, the precipitate of small particles of inert powder frequently plug the orifice of the chlorinator thus interfering with its proper functioning. It was recommended, that a liquid solution of sodium hypochlorite be ordered, then metered down to the desired strength of approximately 0.5% for use with the chlorinator.\n\nIt may therefore be concluded that inadequate and ineffective chlorination has been provided during the past year at least, owing to the inherent defects of the installation and misleading tests on the efficiency of treatment, as described above. This has resulted in the school authorities being misled and living under a sense of false security in believing that the water supply was being adequately safeguarded against contamination by means of the chlorination apparatus installed.\n\nGENERAL SOURCES OF EXAGGERATED - MOOSE RIVER -\n\nThe Moose River drains a considerable area receiving the drainage from the Abitibi, Mattagami and other larger rivers. It is probable that some pollution enters the river and various tributaries. The pulp and paper mill at Kapuskasing is known to discharge sewage and industrial wastes into the river. Closer at hand are a number of small lumber camps upstream from the school which may introduce both fecal matter and garbage into the river. Such pollution would be such as to render the river water unsafe for drinking.\n\nSEVERE SOURCES OF SEWAGE POLLUTION - MOOSE RIVER -\n\nThe closest and most serious source of sewage pollution affecting the quality of the school's supply is the drainage from the Mission's sewage system as will be described in more detail later. Septic tank effluent finds its way into the river only 300 feet from the water supply intake.\n\nDeposits of garbage, tin cans, debris and refuse were found along the river bank fronting the settlement and are illustrated in an accompanying photograph. It was also noted that the majority of the Indian dwellings were without privies or other means of sewage disposal. Consequently the refuse deposits include fecal matter.\n\ncontinued......\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6204)\n\nFile 467-10, part 1\nJames Bay Agency - Moose Factory - Moose Fort Schools - Admissions & Discharges, 1916 - 1938.\n\nFile 467-10, part 2\nJames Bay Agency - Moose Factory - Moose Fort Schools - Admissions & Discharges, 1939 - 1946.\n\nFile 467-10, part 3\nJames Bay Agency - Moose Factory - Moose Fort Schools - Admissions & Discharges, 1947 - 1949.\n\nFile 467-10, part 4\nJames Bay Agency - Moose Factory - Moose Fort Schools - Admissions & Discharges, 1949 - 1953.\n\nFile 467-23, part 1\nJames Bay Agency - Moose Factory - Moose Fort Schools - Deaths, 1940 - 1951.\nST.

I regret to say that Rev. Curry wrote that he was obliged to allow the two Indians, Davies and Coutts, today, to leave the school.

John D. Griffin, Principal, in care of the Moose Fort Boarding School. As you know, it is not possible to have a medical examination at this time, due being no doctor near. It is understood in these cases that the Principal use his own judgment as to whether he considers the applicant healthy or not, and that he will apply for a medical exam in the first opportunity he has. Griffin guarantees the boy's entire health, with no signs of disease. He is attending school, and his report card was sent in last week, and he is doing well.\n\nI find that I have the wrong name. I wrote it as \"Albany Day School.\" I confused the names of the sisters. I had a letter from my father and accidentally mentioned the name of a daughter who was attending the day school.

Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRight Rev. J. G. Anderson,\nBishop of Moose Cree,\nCochrane, Ont.\nOTTAWA, September 7, 1922.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe June quarter return of the Moose Fort Indian Boarding School shows that two pupils, viz., No. 1, John Carpenter and No. 62, Barbara Pante are too old to attend classes.\n\nJohn Carpenter is nearly 16 years of age, and has been in the school ever since he was a child. We understand that his time is entirely employed in outside work. The Department has been paying the per capita grant for him for number of years, and we have now come to the conclusion that this boy will not be able to receive any discharge and earn his own living outside. We will not pay the school any further per capita grant for him after the end of the present quarter, namely, September 30, 1922. You should either grant his discharge or, if he is needed at the school, arrange to pay him for his services and leave his name off the returns after the end of the present quarter.\n\nPupil No. 62, Barbara Pante, is 16 years of age. This girl has now reached the age 16-1/2 for discharge, and the grant will not be continued for her after the end of the present quarter, viz., September 30, 1922.\n\nIt is also noted by the return that Pupil No. 621, Louise Allen, does not attend classes. This girl is stated on the return to be 16 years of age. If she is receiving no instruction she should also be discharged. The Department cannot pay grant for pupils who do not receive regular instruction.\n\nYou will please note the Department's decision regarding the first two named pupils and we will be pleased to hear from you regarding the case of Louise Allen.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Holman,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. John T. Griffin,\nPrincipal, Indian Boarding School,\nMoose Fort, James Bay,\nVia Mattie, Ont.\nOttawa, September 5, 1922.\n\nSir-\n\nI beg to submit herewith my report of the Treaty Nine trip to James Bay for 1922.\n\nThe following children made application to be admitted to the Moose Factory Boarding School:\n\nMary Richard (orphan) No. 88 Albany Band.\nSofia and Evadney Solomon, No. 160 Albany Band (Mother dead).\nRodrick McDonald and Emily Chum.\n\nAll were examined by the doctor and their admission approved.\n\nH. N. Iwrey.\nSt Thomas Mission\nHorse Fort\n5766 E.O. James Bay\nVia matter Oct\n\nOct 4th 1922\n\nTo the Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 44-610 of Sept 4th I wish to say that I have noted your decision regarding John Carpenter and Barbara Pants. As regards Louise Allen she is now attending school every day.\n\nI remain your sincerely,\n\nJ.J. Cuffin\nPrincipal Oct 4th\nOttawa, October 26, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of the September quarter return of the Moose Port Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that Winnie Iserhoff, pupil No. 017, entered the school July 19th. Please furnish the Department with the names of the parents of this girl and state as to what band of Indians they belong.\n\nFor your guidance in preparing your returns in future, I would point out that each pupil when entering the school should be given a new number which should be retained during the period of residence. It appears from your letter that when a pupil leaves the school, his or her number is given to some other pupil. This should not be done in future, as, if so, it is extremely difficult to properly check the return.\n\nAs you are aware, the policy of the Department is that only Indian children be admitted as grant earning pupils to Indian residential schools. As far as possible applications for the admission of new pupils should be submitted each year to the paying officer for his approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. T. Griffin,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nMoose Port, James Bay,\nVia Mattice, ONT.\nOttawa, January 30, 1924.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of the December quarter return of the Moose Fort Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that the register numbers of the pupils have been changed. As a result it was difficult to properly check the return.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to official letter of August 26th, last, in which you were informed that each pupil, when entering the school, should be given a new number which should be retained during the period of residence. When a pupil is discharged, his or her number should be dropped and should not be given to any other pupil.\n\nI trust that, in future, you will carry out these instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. T. J. Griffin,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nMoose Fort, James Bay,\nVia Mattice, ONT.\nTo the Secretary  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter 44-6-10 dated 26th 1923. In reply, I wish to say, that I have noted your request regarding the number to be given & retained by each pupil. Regarding the pupil \"Winnie\" (last name not visible), the parents of this pupil belong to Rupert's House & our missionary in charge then informs me as follows. That the mother is an Indian and that he considers the father an Indian. Should this information still be satisfactory.\n\nYours sincerely,\nJ. Griffin Principal\nResidential School\nMoose Fort\nJames Bay\nOnt.\nMay 6th 1924\n\nTo the Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter No 444-6-10 is laid. I wish to say that your instructions will be carried out in future when making out the Returns for the School.\n\nI regret to have given you trouble over the checking of my returns.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, August 13, 1924.\n\nHonorable,\n\nDr. Scott,-\n\n(Extracts from report of Mr. H.E. Awrey).\n\nApplications were made for the admission of Redfern Ernest Louttit, No. 73, Albany Band, aged 9 years to Chapleau Boarding School, and for admission of Daisy Maggie Farley, No. 174, Albany Band, aged 6\u00bd years, and Agnes Louttit, No. 73, Albany Band, to Moose Factory Boarding School. These children were examined and passed by Dr. Harry, and I recommend their admission.\nOttawa, January 29, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nUntil such time as the Department requires applications and certificates of health for each pupil admitted to the Moose Factory Residential School, it is desired that one or more of the enclosed forms should accompany your quarterly return.\n\nAs you will note the form requires you to furnish certain specific information regarding the pupils admitted to and discharged from the school during the period covered by the quarterly return with which this form is forwarded.\n\nAll information requested on the form should be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Perrier, Esq., M.A.\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Perrier:\n\nDuring my recent visit to our Society's school at Moose Fort the Principal drew my attention to the advisability of having the following pupils at this institution removed either to the Chapleau School or to the new School about to be opened at Sioux Lookout.\n\n(a) Gilbert Faries, admitted August 28, 1921, born March 26, 1916. Registered No. 4.\n(b) Daisy Faries, admitted April 4, 1925, born May 18, 1918. Registered No. 018.\n(c) Roderick McDonald, admitted July 2, 1922, born Nov. 25, 1915. Registered No. 8.\n\nThe mother of Gilbert and Daisy Faries, the Principal informs me, is a very immoral woman, having at least four illegitimate children, but she expressed the desire the last time the Principal saw her, that these two children should be moved to either one or the other of the above institutions.\n\nWith regard to Roderick McDonald, the teacher at our Moose Fort School, Mr. Waller, is strongly of the opinion that he will develop into a splendid man and may bring great credit to his race if offered better educational facilities than Moose Fort possesses.\n\nBoth he and the Principal were strongly of the opinion that all the three above children should be moved to one of the larger schools and I now write to recommend that they be transferred to the new school at Sioux Lookout. As Canon and Mrs. Griffin will be leaving Moose Fort early in August and proceeding first to Saskatoon on furlough before going to Ireland they would be able to escort these children.\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq., M.A.\n\nAll the way to Sioux Lookout where they would be received by the new Principal, the Rev. J. P. J. Marshall, who will be in residence from the 1st of July.\n\nAs the cost of transferring these children would be borne by our Society, provided your Department continues to pay the per capita grant during the period they are en route, I trust that their transfer may be sanctioned.\n\nBelieve me, with kind regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/MP\nOttawa, July 5th, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to transferring three pupils from the Moose Fort Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the transfer of Gilbert Parlee, Daisy Parlee and Hoderick McDonald to the new Indian Residential School at Sioux Lookout. It is understood that the Department will not be responsible for the transportation expenses of these children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Her mother wants to take her out in the spring and has been writing to her with that in view and as she is a woman who lives an immoral life I want to do everything in my power to have Nellie sent to another school where she can secure a broader education and, if possible, avoid such a life.\n\nI have written to Bishop Anderson to discourage the mother coming here (she is at present living in Cochrane) as she stated in one of her letters to Nellie that she would see the Bishop and ask for Nellie in the spring. I also wrote to Miss Dorey stating that I was taking the matter up with you and that you would either write direct or through me which ever you thought best. In the meantime I shall be glad if you will advise me in the matter. Nellie is very anxious to go to another school and Mr. McGrath and myself thought that Shingwauk would be more desirable than Chapleau on account of placing a greater distance between the mother and child, thus avoiding any influence to turn Nellie to the lower life.\n\nWe shall be glad to do everything in our power re this case.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMatron.\nOttawa, February 2nd, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to transferring Hellie Allisapie, No. 01, from the Moose Port Residential School to the Shingwauk Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of this girl's transfer but we are not prepared to allow any part of her transportation expenses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Westgate,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nTo the Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRegarding Philip Sutherland.\n\nPhilip was born 25th Sept. 1913, was admitted into this school 1st June 1924, in good health. Philip's father informs me that he placed Philip in this school for three years & that Rev. Canon Griffin, the then principal agreed to that arrangement. I explained to him, the ruling of the Indian Department regarding pupils under 18 years of age. I also told him I would refer the matter to you before I could accede to his request.\n\nIf the parents take their children without the permission of the principal what course would you advise to take?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n#14\nEntered June 1924\nOttawa, March 10th, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo, in which you advise that you have received an application for the discharge of Philip Sutherland, No. 14, from the Moose Factory Residential School. In reply I beg to say that, while the Indian Act only gives authority for retaining a pupil in the school until he reaches his sixteenth birthday, the Department is willing to pay grant for pupils in residential schools until they reach the age of eighteen years, as it is felt that it is in the best interests of both the school management and the children themselves to remain until that age. This is especially true in the case of girls, and the Principal and others interested in Indian education are expected to make every reasonable endeavour to this end.\n\nI note, from your letter, that the father of Philip Sutherland states that the previous principal, Rev. Canon Griffin, promised to keep this boy in the Moose Factory School for three years only. If you feel that this promise was made, it might be well to carry it out in order that there might be no ill feeling engendered against the school. No such promises should, however, be made to Indian parents in the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J.A.

The Matron found the door unlocked shortly after the girls had gone to bed. Maggie denied that she unlocked it. She denied again the next morning until other girls were called then she admitted that she unlocked the door intending after the girls had gone to sleep to go into the boys' room. To avoid misunderstanding I asked the father and mother with Rev. Mr. Mark as interpreter to come and see and hear for themselves. The mother came alone and after seeing the place and hearing the confession she took her daughter home without my permission, although I assured her as far as I knew the Indian Department would advise dismissal of the girl. At present there is no magistrate and no policeman in the place. Owing to mail service I have not been able to write before.\n\nI am now writing for advice regarding Maggie. I would recommend her dismissal, but something should be done to prevent the parents taking their children from the school without permission. I am informed it has been a common practice in the past.\n\nI might say regarding Maggie Rickard that she was admitted to school last June, that she was always a dull and indolent girl.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 13th, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the first ultimo, I beg to say that the discharge of Maggie Rickard, No. 027, from the Moose Port Residential School is approved.\n\nThe Department is of the opinion that a Principal of a residential school should be able to prevent Indian parents taking their children from the school without permission.

Waller, Principal\nof the Indian Residential School and Day School for Indians and\nwhite children, to the effect that some of the day pupils were\nattending school in a very haphazard manner.\n\nI made a roundup of the offenders and interviewed\ntheir parents. The parents I found had a very strange attitude\ntowards their children with regard to school attendance. If the\nchild said he did not want to go that was all there was to it.\nThey would not force the child or strap the child but were\nperfectly willing for me to strap the child. If they did it their\nchild would hate them. I informed them that I had no intention\nof strapping their children, and that they were the offenders\nand not the children. I explained the contents of Sec. 10 S.S.4\nof the Indian Act to them, and have posted a notice explaining\nit fully, in the H.B.C. store.\n\nI have not made separate cases of these offenders\nas the laxity was pretty general, and parents very ignorant.\nThe parents of the next offender however will receive the usual\nthree days notice. Some of the offenders are half breed\nchildren and do not come under the Indian Act.

February 13, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI shall be obliged if you will furnish me with an expression of your wish with regard to the boy Walter Richard of Albany who has been in attendance at our Moose Factory School and is now eighteen years of age. The Principal states that he talked this matter over with the Indian Agent, and was advised by him to have the boy returned to his home at Albany. The boy states that there is \"absolutely nothing for him at Albany and wishes to stay here at Moose.\" When the Indian Agent left Moose for Albany on January 16th., the Principal asked him to take Walter with him, but he refused to do so. The Principal then approached the Revillon Freres about transportation, but that would mean a delay until navigation opens in the spring, and it would involve a cost of $25.00 as the boy would have to travel as a passenger, and his ticket would cost that sum. The Principal wrote to the father last autumn and asked him to come and take his son away, but the father did not come nor did he acknowledge the receipt of the Principal's letter.\n\nAs the boy is now eighteen years of age, it seems to me that the best thing to be done is to allow him to stay at the Moose Factory School, as a grant-earning pupil, until such time as he is able to secure some employment in the spring or early summer.

Hamilton, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nMoose Factory, Ont.\nWinnipeg, Man., June 11, 1931\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following is an extract from a letter written on May 30th, 1931 by the Rev. P. A. Northam, our Church's missionary at St. Paul's Mission, Albany, James Bay, to the Rev. J. Blackburn, Principal of our Moose Factory School, and just received here:\n\n\"The Revillon Power boat and two scows leave here next week for Moose. I am seizing the opportunity to send over to Moose three or perhaps four children. It is an emergency case. One of our families here had a very unfortunate time. The mother and three big boys died and the father and the remaining five children were found in a starving condition by the man's brother. The woman had been dead nearly a month and the boys for a couple of weeks. The bodies were unburied as the survivors had little strength to do anything. As soon as this news was brought in here food was sent out to them, and arrangements were made to get them in by canoe as soon as a canoe could be taken along the coast. The children have picked up wonderfully, but the father is in poor shape. He will be unable to look after his little girls and a boy of about seven. The oldest girl is about 12 years.\n\nI do not know if you have any vacancies in the school, but I feel sure that, in a case of emergency, you will do your best and accommodate them in some way until such times as you are likely to have older children leaving the School. You may rest content that this is a real case for special effort otherwise I would not be sending them to you without first having made arrangements to do so with you.\"\nIn view of the painfully distressing circumstances set forth in this communication, I do not see that Mr. Wortham could have taken any other action than the one, nor do I see that the Principal of our Moose Factory School can do otherwise than receive the children mentioned when they arrive, and admit them to our school as grant-earning pupils. The Principal states that clothing will be required at once for these children, and requests authority to buy it locally. This authority is being granted, with a request that the account be kept separate, and forwarded to me for submission to your Department. I shall be obliged, therefore, if you will approve the admission of these children to our school, and meet the cost of clothing and transportation when the accounts are submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, R.I.O.C.\nOttawa, June 16th, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to three or four children whom it has been found necessary to send to the Moose Fort Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the circumstances, their admission is approved and grant will be allowed for them. When forwarding his June quarter return, the Principal should give full information regarding these children on the admission and discharge form which accompanies the return.\n\nIt is noted that it was found necessary to purchase some clothing for them and, as it is presumed that only the clothing absolutely required was secured, payment for same will be made upon receipt from you of a properly certified account, in duplicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Revillon Freres. Possibly the Departmental cheque was sent to the Fur Trade Department Hudson's Bay Company, Winnipeg and they have not yet been able to advise their Manager at Moose Factory.\n\nIf, by any chance the cheque has not yet gone forward may I request that it issue in due course.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.Secy-Treas.\nIndian Residential School Commission\nM.S.C.C.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, February 19, 1932.\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 4th instant, your No. 622, regarding the account for $21.60 from your Moose Factory Post, I have to say that it is now found this account was forwarded to the Department by the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, Winnipeg, on the 5th of September last, and a cheque in payment, to the amount of $21.40, was sent to The Manager, Hudson's Bay Company, Moose Factory, Via Cochrane, Ont., on September 18th, last.\n\nTwo dresses at $1.19 each were supplied, a total of $2.38, while in the account the charge was $2.56, which accounts for the deduction of 20 cents in the account as rendered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.

I understand that this expenditure was incurred previous to your appointment and, also, that it was a rather special case. Under these circumstances, the account is being paid. I would point out, however, that, in future, you should not authorize any expenditure for transportation to and from the Moose Fort or Albany Residential Schools without first receiving specific authority from the Department.\n\nIn the case of these two schools, it is considered that the parents should be able to arrange for the transportation of their children to and from the school without cost either to the Department or the school authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Four of the said applications have not been signed by the parent since at the time of taking in the children I did not have the necessary application forms, and by the time the forms arrived the parents had left for their respective homes. Dr. Tyner advised me to send in the applications to you and explain the circumstances. If you desire the applications signed please return same and I will have the parents sign when they return next summer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, September 27, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of applications and certificates of health for the admission of the following children to the Moose Fort Indian Residential Schools:\n\nKatie Sutherland\nSimon Sutherland\nDorothy Stevens\nSinclair Cheechoo\nAnnie Cheechoo\n\nProvided they are not in excess of the number for which grant is allowed, you may inform the Principal that the Department approves the admission of the above-mentioned children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nDr. W.

D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nDr. W. L. Tyer,\nIndian Agent,\nMoose Factory,\nVia Moosonee, Ont.\nOttawa, October 23rd, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to send back the September quarter return of the Moose Fort Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department allows grant for 43 days' holidays and, when preparing the September quarter return, the Principal should request payment, in the case of those pupils who were in the school on June 30th, for the exact number of days each pupil is in residence during the September quarter plus the 43 days' holidays for which grant is allowed.\n\nIt would appear from the return that the majority of the children who were in the school on June 30th were also in residence for 44 days during the September quarter. If this is correct, the Principal should have asked grant for 87 days for each of these children, viz., 44 days in residence plus 43 days' holiday leave. If, however, the children were only in residence for one (1) day during the September quarter, the return submitted by the Principal is correct. However, as there is some doubt in the matter and the Department wishes to pay the school the grant to which it is entitled, the return is being sent back in order that you may review it and, if corrections are necessary, you should have these made.\n\nThe grant requested for the new pupils who entered the school during the quarter is correct as it is apparent from the information given under the heading \"Date of entrance to school\" that the Principal has only requested grant for these new pupils from the date of entrance to September 30th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It seemed to me that that was really the cause of a lot of the trouble\u2014the Williams family thinking that now her husband was dead the widow was wanting to go back to the Catholic church and take the children with her\u2014I told the Williams family that that was up to the mother.\n\nI was very much surprised when she asked me to examine two of the children for the Moose school\u2014as far as I know no pressure was brought to bear on her, but of course in spite of my warnings the Williams family may have.\n\nI had no forms with me so I examined the children and told the mother I would send the forms for her to sign when I got back to Moose.\n\nThe forms were made out and given to the H.B.C. to send up to the Anglican mission at Albany for her to sign but were overlooked in the mail and did not go, when I discovered they had missed the last fall mail I sent them in to you.\n\nIf in the meantime the widow has decided she wants to be a catholic that is her privilege, but last summer her statement to me was that she was an anglican.\nOttawa,\nMay 18, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to our letter of April 20 regarding certain application forms for children entering the Moose Fort Indian Residential School I wish to advise you that these have now been received.\n\nI note the information contained in your letter of May 4 and when you visit Albany in July you should obtain from Mrs. Williams a statement setting forth the religious auspices under which she desires her children educated. In forwarding this statement you should certify on it that her decision has been reached without influence from any outside parties.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nW.

In your letter you ask if there is any special reason why these children should receive institutional care, and state that it is not your Department's practice to approve the admission to Residential Schools of children from Agencies where Day Schools are operated, provided the parents are able to support them and have them attend such Day Schools.\n\nFrom a copy of the Principal's reply to your letter on the 9th instant, I learn that \"the parents of these children are away from the post approximately nine months of the year\", and consequently are unable to receive much training in the local Day School.\n\nMoreover, as they are a handicap and anxiety to their parents when hunting and trapping, and are very liable to suffer severely from exposure and undernourishment during the long and trying season, it would be greatly to their advantage, as well as to that of their parents, if they were placed in a Residential School.\n\nAs \"every post about the Bay\" is reported to me to have its Day School supported by the Department and as the Principal of our Moose Factory School states that he does not admit to his School children of \"parents who spend the year...\"\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Department of Indian Affairs may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name: John Wesley\nAge:\nName of Band:\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.: Alex Wesley\nMother's full name and No.: Agnes Wesley\nParents living or dead: Living\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: Church of England\nDoes applicant speak English?

The School at Moose understand that a grant will only be given for 100 pupils but I am examining all they take in\u2014I believe they expect to have 115 pupils.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.L.Tyrer\n\nAug 9th\u2014It has been the policy of the Department as far as I know to take in children of Indians that go away in the fall to hunt and stay out most of the time even if there is a day school at the Post\u2014We have day schools at Moose, Albany and Fort George, yet we have always taken children into the schools from these places.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.L.Tyrer\nOttawa,\nAugust 30, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant the Department approves the admission to the Moose Port Indian Residential School of the children mentioned in your letters of July 13, July 20, July 26 and August 25.\n\nIn the last paragraph of my letter of August 8 the following statement appeared: \"In admitting the children to the Moose Port School it should be understood that the Department can only allow a per capita grant of $100.00.\" This was a typographical error. It should have read: \"The Department can only allow a per capita grant for 100 pupils.\"\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nW. L. Tyree, Esq., M.

Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nOur Commission have received repeated requests for a number of the children at our Moose Factory School to be allowed to return to their homes during the summer holidays. As you will know, these children are recruited from various centres around the shores of James Bay, such as Albany, Rupert House and East Maine. The difficulty in acceding to their request lies in the lack of transportation during the holiday period.\n\nSo far as the children from Albany are concerned, it is the opinion of our Commission that the parents themselves might be able to spend part of the holiday period with their children at the school.\n\nWith regard to those from Rupert House and East Maine, it would seem that the only way for them to reach their homes and again return to the school would be for them to travel in the boat \"Charles Stuart\" which your Department has placed at the service of your local representative, Dr. Tyrer.\n\nAs I understand from the Rev. Principal Thompson that Dr. Tyrer will be paying treaty during that time at different centres around the Bay, I am writing for the specific purpose of ascertaining if you will grant him and the Principal authority for the children from these two centres to be taken home and brought back in the Government boat.\n\nI commend this arrangement to your sympathetic\nconsideration, and sincerely trust that the authority requested may be granted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nApril 13, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant with reference to transporting children from the Moose Fort Residential School to their homes for holidays this summer.\n\nThe Department has no objection to children from this school going home for holidays provided the parents arrange for their transportation or the school management wishes to pay for it. The Department, however, will not have any funds available for such purpose.\n\nRegarding your suggestion that arrangements be made to use the Departmental boat for transporting children from the Moose Fort School, I feel that this would be difficult to arrange to the mutual satisfaction of all parties concerned. Besides, if such permission were granted similar requests would likely be received from other schools in your locality as well as at other points throughout the Dominion.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Please let me know if it is the intention of the Principal to apply for the discharge of the above-mentioned two boys at the end of June, 1940.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. W.

School at Moose Factory because the parents of the children live on the Island and can attend day school, yet the R.C. Mission take these children from Moose Factory into the R.C. Mission Res. School at Albany.\n\nI have told the Anglican Mission at Moose Factory that I will not approve of the application, but that if the R.C. Mission want to keep these pupils at the Res. School at Albany without receiving a grant from the Department that there would be nothing I could do about it.\n\nPlease inform me as to your views on the matter as I will be going to Albany to examine the children the 1st of September.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. L. Tyre\n\n[Stamp: Department of Mines & Resources]\n\nAUG 14 1940\nOttawa,\nAugust 16, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant I may say that your action in insisting on Anglican parents who are able to do so sending their children to the Moose Factory Day School rather than the residential school is approved.\n\nHowever, in the case of Catholic Indian children, if their parents wish to send them to the Albany Residential School the Department cannot see any reason why they should be prevented from doing so.\n\nIt has always been our practice throughout Canada to permit parents whose religion is different from the religion under which the day school is operated to send their children to the nearest residential school conducted under their own religious auspices.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. W.

Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Dr. Moore;\n\nI have just returned from my extended holiday, and upon my arrival I find that the two children who were to come to us from the Lady Minto Hospital have not arrived.\n\nOn checking up I find that Daisy Wynne has returned to her home in Moosonee, and I am wondering if that is according to your wishes or if you desire her to come into the school. I shall await your reply before approaching the family. I shall be glad to have this girl come into the school, also the other girl, as well if it is according to your wishes. I have not been able to discover where the other girl is.\n\nWhile we were in London we received the news of Dr. Tyer's passing. It came to us as a shock, although we had known for some time that Dr. Tyer was far from well.\n\nIf there is anything we can do to help carry on until a new agent arrives we shall be only too glad to do it. Please do not hesitate to call upon us.\n\nMay I take this opportunity of wishing you the Compliments of the Season.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGilbert Thompson\nOttawa, Ontario,\nDecember 23, 1940.\n\nDear Doctor Brunet:\n\nWhen I visited the Lady Minto Hospital at Cochrane in October, I believe there were two girls in the hospital, Daisy Wynne and Ellen Blacksmith, who, we thought, might be discharged to the Residential School at Moose Factory.\n\nDaisy Wynne has been sent home, but I believe Ellen Blacksmith is still in hospital. If you think she is all right, we could arrange to have her given some special care in the School. I would be glad to hear from you on this subject.\n\nCompliments of the Season.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. E. Moore, M.D., D.P.M.,\nActing Superintendent of Medical Services.\n\nL. E. Brunet, Esq., M.D.,\nCOCHRANE, Ontario.\n\nN.W.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nDecember 23, 1940.\n\nDear Mr. Thompson:\n\nI have your letter of December 17. We were all greatly shocked at Doctor Tyrer's sudden death.\n\nI do not know how soon we will be able to get a doctor up there to replace him. Your kind offer of assistance is greatly appreciated. I believe the Department has placed the R.C.M.P. Constable nominally in charge until a new Agent is appointed, but your kind cooperation will be appreciated.\n\nI have written Miss Hadland regarding some patients in the hospital. I believe Daisy Wynne would be much better in the School if you can arrange to get her in. If you are ever given per capita grant, I will pay for her maintenance in the School from the Medical Vote.\n\nThe other girl was Ellen Blacksmith of Rupert's House. She, apparently, has been kept in the hospital at Cecchran. I shall write them regarding sending her to the School. If she is to be sent, we will let you know.\n\nI would like to extend to you and your Staff Compliments of the Season.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. E.

(RC 10, volume 6204, file 467-40, part 2)\nWINNIPEG, MAN., February 3, 1948.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYou will note from the following extract from a letter just received from the Rev. Gilbert Thompson, B.A., Principal of our Moose Factory School, that he desires some definite ruling with regard to circumstances under which Indian parents may have their children removed from a school into which they have duly admitted, and where they are expected to remain until they have attained the age limit for their discharge.\n\nMr. Thompson's letter was dated Moose Factory, Jan. 24th, and reads in part as follows:\n\n\"In this area parents apparently think they can take out their children whenever they please. The most recent instance occurred this week when the wife of Thomas Niekoshi asked for her children out of the school. She gave as her reason that since her husband had joined the army she needed the children home to help look after the smaller children while she helped her 16 yr. old boy to get wood. The two whom she wanted are girls, 12 yrs. and 14 yrs. respectively. I am fairly well convinced that the reason she gave was not the real one. I had a little trouble with the younger of the two girls and told her that if she could not behave better I would not let her stay in school. She went home and told her mother what I had said and her mother told her she would take her out of school. Before the mother came to see me she went to see the Agent telling him that she needed the girls home to help her and he said as far as he was concerned it would be alright for her to take them out, but that she had better come and see...\"\nI have let the children go since I could not see that I could do otherwise. Hence my reason for asking if there is any ruling on the matter. If there isn't would it be possible to obtain one from the Dept.?\n\nI happen to know Thomas Nickoski and his wife, Clara, quite well. I also remember that, before our new and larger school was built at Moose Factory, some of their children were being educated in our Chapleau School. When the new school was ready at Moose Factory the two children that were at Chapleau were transferred to the Moose Factory School, and I learned from Mr. Thompson that these are the very children that the mother is now insisting on having at home with her. Mr. Thompson's statement that he is fairly well convinced the reason given by Mrs. Nickoski for wanting the children home was not the real one seems to me to indicate that we would be justified in asking that the case be very carefully reconsidered by the Indian Agent, and an order given for the children to be returned to the school, should it be found that they were allowed to leave for reasons which are not in accordance with the facts.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBEW*WS\n\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 7, 1948.\n\nDear Doctor Westgate:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to the communication you have received from the Principal of the Moose Port Indian Residential School. I am forwarding a copy of your letter to the Indian Agent and asking him for a report. On receipt of his reply you will be further advised.\n\nIn the meantime I may say that it has always been definitely understood that when a child is admitted to an Indian residential school such child should remain there until formally discharged by the Department. Such discharge is usually recommended either by the Principal or the Indian Agent and I believe, in most cases at least, both these officials concur before applying for discharge. With this in mind I am at a loss to understand why Mr. Thompson allowed the children to leave the school without making application to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. T.B.R. Westgate, D.D.,\nSecretary, Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission,\nM. S. C. C.,\n26-45 The Bible House,\n154 Alexander Ave. East,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 7, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI attach, for your information, a copy of a letter received from Rev. Dr. Westgate. This letter explains itself and I should appreciate having a report from you.\n\nAs a matter of fact the Principal of the Moose Port Residential School had no right to allow the child to leave without having received formal permission from the Department. In this regard I would direct your attention to the first paragraph appearing on the application for admission form.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. T.J. Orford,\nIndian Agent,\nMoose Factory, Ont.\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have noted the contents of your letter and that of Dr. Westgate, which you attached.\n\nMr. Thompson's comments were rather a surprise to me, as he remarks that apparently parents in this area think they can take out their children whenever they please. This is the first instance to my knowledge where I have, in mutual agreement with Mr. Thompson, sanctioned the removal of children from residence - although the R.C.M.P. Police and myself have been approached on other occasions to interfere.\n\nMrs. Nickoshi came to complaining of treatment her children received at the school and demanded that they be allowed to go home and stay with her - also giving as an excuse that she needed the children to help her since her husband had joined the army. As the woman was quite hard to handle, I went to Mr. Thompson and discussed the matter with him and it seemed best to both of us to avoid further trouble by allowing the children to go out, provided they attended Day School. Mr. Thompson made the remark that he was not at all anxious for the children to return to Residential School, as he anticipated that if this was done their mother would continue to be a source of trouble.\n\nIn future any complaints will be discussed with Mr. Thompson and both sides of the matter referred to you for decision.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. T.J. Orford\n\nO/L\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nMarch 12th, 1942\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Bradap Northern Memorial Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Josephine Roberts\nEnglish name: Josephine Roberts\nAge: 7\nName of Band: Roberts' House\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No.: Bertie Roberts\nMother's full name and No.: Bertie Roberts\nParents living or dead: Dead\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: Church of England\nDoes applicant speak English?

Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nIn view of the fact that I acknowledged your letter in which you asked that the services of the R.C.M.P. be not used unless absolutely necessary, I feel it my duty to report to you that I have had occasion to call upon the services of the local R.C.M.P.\n\nOn the evening of Nov. 20th., between 6.30 p.m. and 7.30 p.m., two boys left the school grounds. I began searching for them shortly afterwards. By 10.00 p.m. I could not locate these boys and knowing that they might have crossed the river, which crossing was precarious in the dark due to the fact that parts of the river were not yet frozen, I notified Cpl. W. Kerr of the R.C.M.P. Together we made a further search that night. The following morning I went to Moosonee and discovered that it was possible the lads had slept in the deserted shack of the family of one lad. No one had seen the boys at Moosonee. That night the policeman and I went across to the shack in the hope that the lads would have returned there, but they were not there. The next morning the policeman took his dogs and went down the railroad track following up a lead that someone had seen two people walking on the track, who had later disappeared into the bush when sighting the on-coming man. The boys were well clothed, but not outfitted for severe weather. Before the policeman overtook them they had walked some 24 miles and had reached the camp of the parents of one of the boys. All returned the following Wed. night by train, including the parents of the one boy. (The other boy comes from East Main and has no parents).\n\nSometime on Thur., the parents of the one boy went to see Dr. Orford, the local Indian Agent, when they asked to take the child out of school giving as their reason, as far as I can ascertain that day, that they were afraid the boy might run away again and get some other boy into serious trouble. The boys gave as their reason for running away that some of the boys teased them. They are 13 yrs and 14 yrs of age. On the Thur. afternoon the policeman came with the parents and said the Indian Agent, Dr. Orford, had given permission for the parents to take their boy, Mathew Chum, #110 out of school, but before doing so the father was to punish his boy in front of the other children. The boy left that afternoon.\n\nIn a letter to Dr. Westgate from Mr. Hoey, #44-6-10 relative to the discharge of pupils Mr. Hoey writes in part.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch\n\nDec.1/43\n\n\"In the meantime I may say that it has always been definitely understood that when a child is admitted to an Indian Residential School such a child should remain there until formally discharged by the Department. I am at a loss to understand why Mr. Thompson allowed the children to leave the school without making application to the Department.\"\n\nIn the instance of this boy being taken out of school you will readily see that I had no opportunity of making application to the Department. I was simply told that the parents were to take the boy out and they waited for him.\n\nThe whole incident does not help us in trying to make the people realize that once they have put their children in school they should leave them there until they are 16 years of age. It will work the opposite. I anticipate other children leaving the school almost on any pretext and the possibility of the parents appearing to take their children out of school. Unless something definite is done about the matter I shall be at a loss to prevent them. I shall appreciate anything you might do to prevent such a situation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. I am sending a copy to Dr. Alderwood for his information.\nThe story\n\nPlease read this letter - will observe it until you come.\n\nLove\nOttawa,\nDecember 7, 1943.\n\nDr. T.J. Orford, Indian Agent, Moose Factory, Ont.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter dated the 1st instant from the Principal of the Moose Fort Indian Residential School in which he reports that two boys truanted from the school and were eventually located. In the case of one of the boys, namely, Matthew Chum, the Principal advises that soon after he was returned to the school the policeman came to the school with the parents and stated that you had given permission for the parents to take the boy home. The Principal allowed him to go.\n\nAs you are aware, when a pupil is placed in a school the permission of the Department must be obtained before discharge can be granted. This regulation is designed not only to preserve uniformity in the handling of the discharge of children but is also a great assistance to the individual Indian Agent, as it relieves him of a considerable responsibility. Of course, in making a decision we are guided by the recommendation made by the Agent, as it is presumed that he has consulted the Principal and that both of them are in agreement.\n\nIn this particular instance the Principal should not have allowed the boy to go until you had furnished him with a copy of our permission. However, the Principal's action at this time does not really affect the point at issue, which is that discharges must be approved by the Department. I should appreciate hearing from you in this matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child\nEnglish name\nAge\nName of Band\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\nFather's full name and No.\nMother's full name and No.\nParents living or dead\nState of child's health\nReligion\nDoes applicant speak English?\nPreviously attended school for years\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness\n\nNotes\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

Dr. Orford, the local agent has done his best to encourage the parents to put their children in the school, with the result that of the 18 new children taken in fifteen are from Moose Factory area.\n\nOur enrollment is 75 this term instead of 93, cannot something be done officially by the Indian Affairs Branch to ensure that the children of school age be made to attend school? When the Indians were hard up we had no difficulty in securing sufficient children to more than fill our school. Now that economically they are better off it is a different proposition. The Indian Act, to my knowledge, states that the children are to attend school between the ages of 7 yrs and 10 yrs. Why isn't it enforced the same as the Public School Act is in a white community? These people know that both the local Indian Agent and R.C.M.P. have not, or are seemingly not allowed to put that law into effect by forceful means.\n\nWe cannot be expected to be able to operate a school on a \u00bd basis especially when you consider how small the per capita grant is.\n\nAnything that can be done to remedy this position will I am sure be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. I am sending copies of this letter to Dr. Orford, & Dr. Alderwood for their information.\nOttawa, December 6, 1943.\n\nDear Mr. Thompsons,\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of November 17 and have noted with interest the somewhat disturbing information contained therein.\n\nThe officials of this Branch are heartily in agreement with you, that a worthwhile educational system cannot be established on the whims and caprices of an illiterate and prejudiced population. This expression of opinion applies to a great many white communities and it certainly applies to a great many of our Indian agencies. You can rest assured, there are, that we shall do everything humanly possible to co-operate with you in any attempts that may be made to change existing conditions. You ask why is not compulsory attendance enforced in Indian communities, the same as the provisions of the Public School Act in white communities. The answer to this question is very simple. Experience has taught us that where compulsion is exercised\u2014and it has been exercised quite frequently throughout the years, in attempts to maintain regularity of attendance at Indian day and residential schools\u2014the results have been invariably disappointing. Attempts on the part of the R.C.M.P. to enforce attendance have created an impression in the minds of a great many Indian parents that our residential schools are penal institutions, established, not for the benefit or education of their children, but to punish them. This feeling or attitude on the part of Indians has become so widespread that we have been recently asked by the Commissioner of the R.C.M.P., not to use his constables as truant officers and that, if we must use them, to use them sparingly. This antagonism on the part of Indians in certain cases has become so pronounced that we have had a suspicion on more than one occasion that the destruction of certain residential schools by fire was deliberate and not accidental. It is just possible that we may find a solution for this problem.\n\nRev. Gilbert Thompson,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nMoose Fort, via Moosonee, Ont.\nby creating courses of study more attractive to Indians and more effectively designed to meet the needs of the Indian population. A limited number of our schools have already reached this ideal. In your case I am disposed to think that the matter is one that should be discussed very fully and in detail with the Indian agent, Dr. Orford, and with a number of the more responsible Indians. If you feel, after this discussion, that compulsion should be exercised and that these children should be compelled to attend school against their own wishes and the wishes of their parents, then compulsion by way of experiment will be authorized.\n\nIn making this statement, I am not hopeful that compulsion will be in any sense more effective in the James Bay area than in other sections of the Dominion, where it has been already tried. It is the remedy that first suggests itself to me when confronted with the problem of non-attendance, but I am not at all sure that it is the best remedy.\n\nI am sending forward a copy of this letter to Dr. Alderwood and to the Indian Agent, Dr. Orford.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hogg,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMines Acton, Ont.,\nDecember 14th, 1963.\n\nDepartment of Mines Resources, Indian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nRe: Loose Fort Residential School\n\nOn November 20th two boys from this school, Matthew Chum and Luke Tomatuk, ran away and walked about 25 miles to the trapping camp of the father of the Chum boy. Corporal Kerr of the local police followed them by dog team, arrived by train of November 18th.\n\nThe parents of the runaway returned to Loose Victory with the boy and insisted on taking him out of school. This was the second time he had run away and they feared he would do it again and that he might be lost or frozen to death if he attempted it. The only alternative they offered was to remain at Loose Victory and neglect their trap lines.\n\nIn view of their opposition to having their son in school I came on this occasion for his future safety I could not do other than give consent for them to take him with them or they could have done so in any case. However, I did insist that they punish the boy themselves and not pass it on to others in the school and this they did willingly enough.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDr. T.J. Lefford\nTruants from Bishop Horden Indian Residential School - Moose Factory, Ont. - Matthew Chum and Luke Tamituk.\n\n1. At 9:15 P.M. of the 20th instant, Rev. G. Thompson of the Indian Residential School reported that two of the pupils were missing, Matthew Chum and Luke Tamituk.\n\n2. After supper, the same evening, both the boys had requested permission to go to the lavatory outside the main building and had not returned after permission had been granted by the supervisor on duty. Matthew Chum had previously been guilty of truancy the preceding spring. Both boys were just under 14 years of age.\n\n3. Accompanied by Mr. Thompson I patrolled the Island and made inquiries among the local residents but to no avail as neither of the boys had been seen. All vacant houses were visited. Later we followed the trail to Moosonee across the Island and where the trail goes onto the river ice we found no marks of anyone going in that direction. The tide at that time was high and the border of water around the shore made it impossible to reach the solid ice. Another route to Moosonee was investigated but no tracks seen on it. The barns and outbuildings of the school had also been searched.\n\n4. The next day it was learned that the boys had slept in a cabin at Moosonee the previous night (The cabin was one belonging to Matthew Chum's father who was on his winter trapping). Indians interviewed reported they had not seen the boys and that they were no tracks on the railway leading south. A further search of the Moosonee district was made but no trace of the missing boys was found. Later in the evening an Indian Trapper who had been walking along the railway south of Moosonee and who had just reached the village, reported that he had seen two persons along the track but they had run into the bush before he could identify them. They had been proceeding south. He also reported that the tracks had reached the railway from a creek bed some two miles from Moosonee which would account for the absence of tracks along the regular path south.\n\n5. Both the boys had been dressed in rubber boots and cloth windbreakers, and although Indians were camped at 12 mile intervals along the tracks, it was feared that a sudden cold spell might have serious results to the boys if they were caught between camps or met with any injury. Neither boy was believed to have matches or axe.\n\n6. The next morning I set out alone with 4 dogs and sled along the tracks leading south. I expected to find the boys at the first Indian Camp but on my arrival there I learned they had passed there the previous afternoon. I continued on and while camped in the bush some 20 miles from Moosonee that evening, I was visited by an Indian returning to his...\n6. - camp from his traps. He informed me that he had passed the boys the previous day and that they were headed for the camp of James Chum, father of Matthew. He stated that this camp was located off the tracks in the bush some 12 miles further on. I hired him as guide and set off within the hour and we travelled to midnight. The guide was a bit off in his computation of mileage and we camped with some Indians for the remainder of the night in the camp that the guide had thought was James Chum's. The next morning we set off again and around noon reached James Chum's camp where I found both truants, Matthew Chum and Luke Tamituk.\n\n7. Both boys, on being questioned, stated that they had left school because the other boys had teased them and for no other reason. The father and mother of Matthew Chum informed me that they had intended to return the boys to school on the weekly train and that the boys had given them the same reason as given me for leaving school.\n\n8. As my 4 dogs were incapable of transporting the boys, guide and myself back to Moose Cree through the prevalent deep snow and I had no camping equipment outside of an axe and canvas sheet, I decided to send the dogs back with the guide and return with the boys on the weekly train which could be flagged from the tracks.\n\n9. I stayed at the camp until the following evening (24-11-43) and we flagged the train at 7:30 P.M. and arrived at Moose Cree the same evening, where I returned the boys to the school.\n\n10. The next day James Chum and his wife applied to the Indian agent, Doctor T.J. Oxford, to have their son released from school as they were worried he might get into trouble sometime by running away and injuring himself or other boys he might take with him. The Indian Agent gave them permission to take the boy back to camp with them, and released him from school.\n\n11. Disciplinary action was taken by the Principal of the school on Luke Tamituk, and Matthew Chum was spanked before the assembled boy pupils at the school by his father.\n\nNo. of days on patrol = 3\nMileage = 70\nExpenses = per form 93-period 30-11-43\n\nCase concluded.\n\nCorp.

I understand that the Department presents each graduate with a Bible and Prayer Book upon such an occasion and am therefore letting you know in time so that the necessary books may be ordered.\n\nMARY SUTHERLAND\nBEULAH MARK\nDOROTHY VINCENT\nCAROLINE MAANSKUM\nJAMES CHEECHO\n\nI might mention in the case of James Cheechoo that during his short stay with us he has made such worthwhile progress that I am asking the Missionary Society of our Church to cover his keep for another year's schooling. He is a good scholar and learning well in the manual training department and it is a shame that he was not able to attend school years ago.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry G. Cook.\nOttawa, May 13, 1946.\n\nDear Archdeacon Cook:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, the Department approves the discharge of the following pupils from the Moose Fort Residential School:\n\nMary Sutherland,\nBeulah Mark,\nDorothy Vincent,\nCaroline Maanakum.\n\nAn order will be placed for the Bibles and Prayer Books, but we have had considerable difficulty in securing these books recently and it is quite possible that they will not reach the school before the end of June.\n\nI note your remarks regarding James Cheechoo. If you wish to keep him and he is willing to stay, we will allow grant for him for another year. The Indian Act gives us power to retain children after 16 years of age if we so desire.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nVenerable Archdeacon H. G.

I've been in hospital so have been unable to let you have a reply sooner.\n\nI have discussed the matter of James Cheechoo's returning to school next year with him and he will be pleased to avail himself of the Department's offer of allowing him to continue his education even though he is over age.\n\nWe at the school appreciate your interest in this lad. He is most anxious to learn and is proving to be rather clever at manual training to so his extra year will be really worth while.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Orford, Indian Agent, Moose Factory, Ontario,\n\nWith reference to the Moose Fort June Quarter Return, the usual application for admission and certificate of health should be forwarded to the Department for Ruth Visitor.\n\nYou may inform the Principal that the Department approves the discharge of pupils numbered as follows:\n\nNo. 145 No. 160.\n\nBernard J. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, October 29, 1946.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nAttached hereto is your quarterly return for September, 1946. Also attached is our circular letter 150-87 dated the 29th of December, 1944, which we hope will assist you in compiling your quarterly return.\n\nWe would like to point out the following discrepancies in your September return:\n\n1. You show only 30 days as the total number of days in the quarter whereas there are actually 92 days, as this quarter includes July, August and September.\n\n2. A study of this circular letter will show you that 62 days' grant is allowed to cover the holiday period for all pupils who were in school at the end of the June quarter. It is presumed that the number of days shown as 30 in your return is incorrect and that 92 days should have been shown. This, of course, will make a great difference in the grant to your school.\n\n3. Under the heading \"Remarks as to progress, etc.,\" the required information should be shown opposite each pupil's name, and, if necessary, a general review covering the various reasons for absence may be included in a letter forwarded with the return.\n\n4. You have shown the names of several pupils on your June return but have omitted these same students from your September return. From Item 2 above you will see that\n\nVenerable Archdeacon H.O. Cook,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nMoose Factory, via Moosonee, Ontario.\n\n........... 62 days'\n62 days' grant is allowed for such children. However, the Department should be requested to approve the discharge of all pupils who have left the school and whose names have been removed from this return.\n\n5. You should note on Form All (Admission and Discharge Form) the name and school number of each pupil admitted or discharged during the quarter. We have not yet received any such form from your school for the September quarter.\n\n6. We would like to emphasize that where a pupil is absent from your school for any length of time, the date of departure from the school, the exact date of return and the reason for such absence should be shown opposite the pupil's name. This applies to pupils in the September return who were late in returning to school and for whom you have requested less than a 30 days' grant.\n\nIt is our sincere hope that the above remarks will act as a guide to you in the compilation of these returns. As you are aware, we have many residential schools, and as our grants are based directly upon pupil attendance, it is most important that we are given correct and accurate information in order that the cheques for such grants can be quickly issued.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

K. Wood\nMD\nOttawa, May 23rd, 1947.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. Falconer\n\nYou will recall that I discussed with you the other day the situation that has arisen at Moose Fort School. Please note the application forms under this memorandum.\n\nI think you will agree that it is simply impossible to operate a residential school along proper lines if the agent persists in following the same course of action as Dr. Orford.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, May 30th, 1947.\n\nDr. T.J. Orford, Indian Agent,\nMoose Factory, via Moosonee, Ontario.\n\nWe are in receipt of the following application forms for children who have been placed in the Moose Fort Residential School,\n\nMarion McLeod - 9 years of age\nAlma Katapaituk - 5 years of age\nWarion Katapaituk - 8 years of age\nSarah Sealhunter - 10 years of age\nIza Cheeso - 9 years of age\nFreddie Blackned - 7 years of age\nGeorge Stewart - 11 years of age\n\nThe names of these children appear on the return of the Moose Fort School and grants requested for them. Due to their physical condition it is extremely doubtful if they can obtain any great benefit from the actual school training and, in addition, each of them knows that their stay in the school is strictly limited. Besides, it must cause a lot of extra trouble to the school staff. We were aware that the procedure adopted in this case had been done in the past, but only with the occasional case.\n\nFrom an educational standpoint it would appear that we are operating a convalescent home. Is there no other provision that can be made for these children? Copy of this letter is being forwarded to the principal of the Moose Fort School.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMoose Factory, Ont.\nJune 11th, 1947.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent,\nWelfare & Training Service.\n\nDear Sirs\u2014\n\nRe: File 44-6-10(WT.1)\n\nReference is made to your letter of May 30th concerning certain children for whom Moose Fort school requests grants.\n\nIt is difficult to see what other provision could have been made for any of these children. There are no facilities here for boarding out that many and once they have recovered from illness it is not feasible for them to remain in hospital. It has been through the courtesy of the school Principal, Archdeacon H.G. Cook, that accommodation was found for them.\n\nEach child was brought to Moose Factory for hospital treatment. In each case it was not possible to return them to their distant homes or I considered they should remain for further observation although such observation did not warrant their occupying hospital beds more urgently required for acutely ill patients.\n\nWith the exception of one child - Isa Cheezo - they are now in good health, thanks almost entirely to good food and care at the school. Aside from any other consideration it would have been inhuman to send them home or into the bush with local families, knowing full well they would not receive the care required.\n\nIsa Cheezo has been returned to hospital as she developed Chorea.\n\nI cannot suggest an alternative unless you could discuss the matter with Dr. Moore with a view to the Health Services making a grant for their maintenance. It would also be appreciated if the Dept. could advise me, what attitude I am to take in future similar cases.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nNovember 1st, 1947\n\nMajor Gen. G. R. Turner\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nTransportation of Indian Children\nto and from Residential Schools\n\nThank you for your letter of 30th October.\n\nFrom the last paragraph I would infer that, if the situation warrants, under Sub-section 3 of Section 9 of the Indian Act you are prepared to assist with the transportation to and from the schools of children who return to their homes during the long summer holidays. Is this correct, please?\n\nI appreciate that your funds for this service are limited and that you work on the basis of treating all residential schools fairly in the matter of allocation of such funds. We have had, however, an abnormal expenditure on transportation during the past summer of children attending our Moose Factory School because of the breakdown of our James Bay boat which necessitated sending the transmission to Toronto for complete overhaul and repair. In consequence, we were obliged to use aircraft to bring the children in from pointe along James Bay, which has been quite an expensive business. Do you feel that you could do something to help by accepting at least some of this transportation cost as a charge against your funds?\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent\n\nGRT/BP\nOttawa, November 17, 1947.\n\nDear General Turner:\n\nWe have your letter of the 1st instant regarding the expenditure incurred in transporting children to the Moose Port Indian Residential School during the summer of 1947. You may submit an account with receipts attached for the expenditure incurred. When we receive this your request will receive further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

Lariviere, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Amos, Quebec.\n\nIt has been suggested to us that there might be several children from Mistassini or Waswanipi who might require institutional care.\n\nIn the past we have sent some of these children to the Chapleau Residential School. However, the Church of England school at Moose Fort is a much better building than Chapleau and we are inclined to feel that in sending Protestant children to a residential school from your Agency in future, it would be preferable to send them to Moose Fort.\n\nPlease let me have your comments and at the same time state the approximate number of children whom you consider might be sent.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MOD\nMay 11th, 1948\n\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nYour No. 44-6-10 (E1) May 7th, 1948\n\nIn reply, no doubt that Moose Fort has only a limited number of vacancies, if we take the children now at Chapleau and those becoming of school age, that we can easily get at, our share would be about 20 Protestant children, living on the railway line or working out from, for this year.\n\nAt Mistassini and Waswanipi, the Indians over previous trials and results, are not in the mood to part with their children as they say \"to send them far away to be spoiled\". From these two Bands, Protestant children there, now of school age about 200 children, I am satisfied if we had within the district a boarding school to take care, they would not object to send them, and more through various routes they would take them in themselves, it would be creating difficulties for the future, insisting that they send them now to Chapleau or Moose Fort, particularly at Mistassini they should be first interested into going to school through Summer Day School, or equal.\n\nMy personal opinion is, if there is space, the children living near or on the railway line scattered all over should have the first opportunity, for this class are almost under pressure now, if they wish to work in the near future, in any event it won't take many years this class will have to earn their living like whites.\n\nI maintain also, the only solution to get results, children from the same Band should be kept as much as possible within others in the district, their nature definitely brings out fault finding with others and finally they start withdrawing children and cause all sorts of difficulties, we must keep in mind also that the Mistassini and Waswanipi Indians are more or less from James Bay, and they feel they are a class by themselves in any event, they will not approve sending them there, traditions will come in heavy on their views.\n\nH.

Kitty Trapper age March 5th, 1935\n2. Christine Trapper Feb 8th, 1936\n3. Francis Trapper Oct 27th, 1935\n\nPlease do not give any vaccine to these children like in the case of others, we will furnish you record later.\n\nIt is like in the case of the others, definitely understood, they will return home for summer vacation, won't be transferred from school without notice to Agency.\n\nI will attend to sending the Ochilanco children at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. Lariviere - Sect. Ind. Agency.\nAugust 3rd, 1948\n\nH.E. Taylor, AOE., Principal Moose Port School, Moose Factory, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe following named children will be removed from Moose Factory - Moose Port School, from La Salle, Que., on August 15th, 1948:\n\nParents: Sinclair Robert, mother Annie,\n1. Children: Helen, Age: Sept. 15, 1933\n2. Francis, Age: May 26, 1935\n3. Beatrix, Age: May 26, 1940\n\nParents: James Trapper, mother Christiana\n4. Children: George, Age: Feb 9, 1937\n5. David, Age: Jan 10, 1938\n6. Mary Lang, Age: Apr 21, 1941\n7. Harry, Age: Jan 4, 1935\n\nParents: Adoptive - James Trapper, & Christiana\nlate Ronnie Trapper - father.\n\n8. Children: Bertha, Age: May 17, 1938 at Moose with Joe. Trapper\n9. Clifford, Age: May 17, 1940\n\nA number of these children were at Chapleau before, it is clearly understood with parents, that all these children will return home for summer 1949 - regular vacations and under no circumstances they are to be removed from school, etc., without notice to Agency.\n\nOther children on line will endeavour to gather at an early date and effect transfers.\nEscort for this group will be Indian Edward Trapper, from La Salle; it appears he wishes to visit the school during his stay. I would appreciate that this request be granted and if he asked any questions about the welfare of the children, that he be given all possible information.\n\nI am endeavouring when possible to have the parents themselves take their children to school, so that they will better understand and cooperate in the future.\n\nBut my best assured, we are most anxious to provide our children with education and more, start them off at proper school age, the Indians more or less the line are inclined to cooperate, however there is certain minor difficulties to adjust, before this becomes a routine, one is they have asked that I visit these children during year, another they insist that they return here in summer, I have guaranteed to them that it will be done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. Lariviere, Sup't, Ind. Agency\nAugust 13, 1948.\n\nMr. H. Lariviere, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Amos, Que.\n\nWe have your letter of the 3rd instant giving the names of children who it is intended to send to the Moose Fort Residential School.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, I may say that it is not our general practice to send home every year, pupils attending a residential school located at a considerable distance from their home reserve. Transportation in such cases involves a considerable expenditure and we would have appreciated it if you had consulted us before promising the Indian parents that their children would come home next year. As apparently you have already made this promise, it places the Department in rather an awkward position.\n\nBernard F. Heary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MCD\nAugust 8th, 1946\n\nH.E. Taylor, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nBishop Borden Memorial School,\nMoose Factory, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Taylor,\n\nMany thanks for having attended to Clifford and Bertha Trapper, it is noted they are now under your care at school.\n\nIn the way of reports, we are interested as follows:\n\n1. To hear when a child is seriously ill.\n2. To be informed, if hospitalized, or removed from school,\n   (which I understand will be done only when requiring medical care)\n3. Report on standing at end of year.\n\nAllow me to repeat my request, under no circumstances our children should be vaccinated without our consent; the reason for this, most of our children are confirmed on distemper, whooping cough, typhoid, paratyphoid, smallpox and BCG (T.B. vaccinations), we had troubles with this before, children suffered with shocks caused by overdoses etc., briefly but frequently, too much vaccine and here in some cases, through BCG vaccinations, we prefer waiting for a year or so, in any event as soon our field work is completed we will furnish you with their records, if ill the medical officer will have a definite guide.\n\nAs soon I reach agreed quota (50), I will wire you, if there is vacancies we might be able to send a few more.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. Lariviere, Sept. Ind. Agency.\nAugust 21st, 1948\n\nH.R. Taylor, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nMoose Fort School, Moose Factory, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe following named children, escorted by Indian Andrew Mark (subject to change at last minute) will report to you logging Oksalumse River August 25th., all are members of this agency.\n\n| Band No. | Name          | Age       |\n|----------|---------------|-----------|\n| Wemanipi | Peter Baynait | April 6   |\n| Do       | Wesley Shempee| July 11   |\n| Do       | Si.oma Minassan| Apl 15    |\n| Do       | Mary Minassan | Sept 13   |\n| Do       | Louise Minassan| July 30   |\n| Mistassini| Charlotte Shempee| June 4    |\n| Do       | adopted by Andrew Mark | 163 |\n| Do       | John Mark (Mathew) | May 31    |\n| Wagmanipi| Ryan Cooper   | Aug 25    |\n\nAll above living in Oksalumse area, were at Chipman, exception for Ryan Cooper.\n\nChild named Allan Cooper Band No. 3 Wemanipi age Aug 31, 1941, will go in later, at present at La Tuque hospital, accident.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. Lariviere - Dept. Ind. Agency.\nOctober 26th, 1948.\n\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nAttention: Mr. L.J. Young, Chief, Education.\n\nFurther to various communications in connection with transportation from Mistassini to Moose Fort - children for the residential school. I first went at Mistassini for annual visit. It was understood with Rev. Ellis, it was not feasible to undertake moving children from Mistassini to Moose Fort at the present time, on account shortage of beds at these schools and there was on the railway lines, in Quebec as well as in northern Ontario and on the Canadian Pacific lines, a good number of children not attending schools at all and next trip would never have the opportunity to attend any kind of schools except a residential school, after discussing this with him, he definitely agreed, it was best thing to do, provide for those on the line and then there as we develop a population, penetrate into remote areas, nearest to transportation facilities.\n\nAfter I left Mistassini, what took place I cannot say, however, the Principal at Moose Fort, communicated with his office, we did everything possible to gather the Indians on the line, excepting for the child hospitalized. All those of school age, applicants, went to Moose, on their own good will and parents escorting themselves.\n\nFinally the request of Mr. Ellis reached us, which was out of understanding, next too late for the Indians at Mistassini to accept willingly and so on, when I visited Mistassini with Mr. Corn, Mr. Lewis in August 1948, I reviewed the children who had been chosen, in most cases, the parents objected and I did not find a good number, on account our records indicated the Indians, feeling minded and in some cases a little children were above school age, that is too old to learn anything, and naturally stupid \"they could not register anything in a school\" good only to do some work around place.\n\nAfter having spent considerable time on this, I visited the Indians themselves with a good interpreter, the parents in most cases informed they had been told or forced or equal to let go their children, which was in some ways in the minds of these primitives, that we were taking away their children forever. After general review, taking into account our records, the following agreed on their own free will.\n1. Ronnie Morrison\n2. Other - not or dead\n3. Father hospitalized\n4. Other dead\n5. Other dead\n\nAbove represented the list as fixed by you.\n\nIn view of the relocation of Mr. Morrison, I have made arrangements to have him transferred to an institution in Ontario, where he will be able to receive proper care and attention.\n\nI am confident that this arrangement will prove beneficial to Mr. Morrison and his family.\n\nEnclosed please find a copy of the report form for Mr. Morrison's case file.\n\nThank you for your cooperation in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs\nTeaching goes in to the same, have not to do\nwith or understanding of the question of Stone V. LITTLETON\nand Mr. Smith, etc., matters not for the last little\nbit of the case, but take it as a whole. It is not an\neasy thing to prove translation, but the fact that we\nhave been able to show that they had knowledge of\ntheir children's welfare, we believe will be a good\nbasis, and we will take advantage of their\nknowledge and will get started, even if we have no\nother evidence. I am confident that we can make\nthe case.\n\nIf at all possible, I would advocate that existing\netc., and I (VI) in order to prevent final stage, be left\nentirely in the hands of the courts, providing we have in advance\nnot to go on the case, until we feel that the materials are\ntaken up. The next step is to have the case heard by the\ncourt of ordinary, then appeal, and if necessary, we may\nwant to appeal at all.\n\nThe question of the welfare of the child is very\nimportant, and we must be careful to see that the\nchild is treated fairly. We must also consider the\nbest interests of the child, and we know that in this case,\nthere are many factors to be considered.\n\n(Signed), L. Irvine,\nActing Indian Agency.\n| Name          | Date of Admission | Band       | State of Education | Remarks Upon Discharge

It is realized that the Principal overlooked getting the Agent's permission and he is being asked to comply with the regulation of your third paragraph in future.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\n\nDictated but not personally signed because of absence from the office.\nAs regard transfers of Indian children on Moose Fort, in order to avoid complications, retain the good will of our PRIMITIVE and so on, at Mistassini it should be definitely arranged during ANNUAL VISIT, and the Indians would be able to adjust themselves, their supplies for coming winter, clothing etc., otherwise we upset them.\n\nTeachers going into these areas have next to no idea or understanding of the reaction of these VERY PRIMITIVE and they cause on such matters nothing else but difficulties and they don't appear to take into consideration it is not an easy matter to provide transportation at a fair cost and so on, which means they pick up any families, without knowledge of their ability etc., endeavour to make them believe it is a good thing, etc., finally the Indians don't live up to their understandings and trouble gets started, more they have no knowledge of their medical records etc., most of the unfit are usually selected.\n\nIf at all possible, I would appreciate that selecting, etc., and providing children for residential schools be left entirely in the hands of the Agency, providing we know in advance how many they can take care, we will see that the wamnecles are taken up, I am most anxious to avoid complications and the sending of children to these schools that we know in advance won't stand up at all.\n\nThe Mistassini Burgomaster experience was one very costly and which upsetted the Indians very much, they are primitive and most cases very much so further they like to be pushed around, we have their good will and through good will I am satisfied we can get them to agree, on sending children out, they understand and know but putting on pressure, by saying you send this one and that one, they won't accept that.\n\nI feel teachers in remote areas should be allowed transportation, this would overcome part of our troubles also.\n\nH. Lariviere - Supt. Ind. Agency.\nOctober 2nd, 1948\n\n1. Ronnie Mianscum - orphan - mother dead #57\n   father hospitalized.\n\n2. Simeon Awash - mother dead.\n\n3. Minnie Mattawashish - mother dead.\n\n4. Johnny Coon Connishish.\n\n5. Dinah Jolly.\n\n6. Clara Jolly.\n\n7. Charlie Coon.\n\n8. Escort to Oskelaneo, for above, from Oskelaneo other children from Waswanipi to go along with on same trip.\n\nMr. Higginson,\n\nAbove represented the limit as fixed by you, acceptable on aircraft as a limit pay load. What took place after my departure I cannot say, however only Mr. Higginson and Ronnie Mianscum showed up at Oskelaneo, I was advised of this, arranged to meet Mr. Higginson at Amos Station, very little information could be secured, as to why the others did not come out, finally I informed in this case, before leaving he should have advised me and there was nothing to justify him to take only one child out and act as escort for the one boy, for only one, the boy could and should have stayed at home.\n\nMy views on the whole matter is this, Rev. Elkins, made efforts to secure authority to transfer by plane, one group direct from Mistassini to Moose Cree, acting as escort himself, considering the number of children recommended in the first place, it was evident the next group was to be taken care of by Higginson, which met - escorting on their way out of Mistassini.\n\nI have no objections to children from Mistassini going to Moose Fort, providing they can be taken care of, once there and that they don't prevent other children from going to school who are living in that area, for our Mistassini Indians, are still far inland and not urgently in need of that type of schooling, Waswanipi is in a greater need, also closer.\nOctober 2nd, 1948\n\nAttention: Mr. B.F. Neary, Supt. Education\n\nFurther to various communications in connection with transfers from Mistassini to Moose Fort - children for this residential school. First when at Mistassini for Annual Visit, it was understood with Rev. Ellis, it was not feasible to undertake moving children from Mistassini to Moose Fort at the present time, on account shortage of beds at these schools and there was on the railway lines, in Quebec as well as in Northern Ontario and on the T.N.& O. lines, a good number of children not attending schools at all and next they would never have the opportunity to attend any kind of schools, except a residential school, after discussing this with him, he definitely agreed, it was the best thing to do, provide for those on the line and from there as we develop accommodation, penetrate into remote areas, nearest to transportation facilities.\n\nAfter I left Mistassini, what took place I cannot say, however the Principal at Moose Fort, communicated with this office, we made every effort possible to gather the Indians on the line, exception for one child, hospitalized, all those of school age, anglicans, went to Moose, on their own good will and parents escorting themselves.\n\nFinally the request of Mr. Ellis reached us, which was out of understanding, next too late for the Indians at Mistassini to accept willingly and so on, when I visited Mistassini with Mr. Conn, Mrs Stevenson, on August 17th, I reviewed the children they had recommended, in most cases, the parents objected and I did also for a good number, on account our records indicated, T.B. infected, feeble minded and in some cases a waste of money, way above school age, that is too old to learn anything, and naturally stupid \" they could not register anything in a school \" good only to do some work around place.\n\nAfter having spent considerable time on this, I visited the Indians themselves with a good interpreter, the parents in most cases informed they had been told or forced or equal to let go their children, which was in some ways in the mind of these primitives, that we were taking away their children by pressure, after general review, taking into account our records, the following agreed on their own free will to go...\nOctober 28, 1948.\n\nRev. Canon H.G. Cook,\nM.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nSuperintendent Lariviere has written us with reference to placing certain children from his Agency in the Moose Port Residential School.\n\nMr. Lariviere states that as a result of mutually satisfactory arrangements between the principal and himself, a number of pupils have been secured for the Moose Port School.\n\nThe following paragraph from his letter outlines what plan the Superintendent would like to follow in future years:\n\n\"If at all possible, I would appreciate that selecting, etc., and providing children for residential schools, be left entirely in the hands of the Agency, providing we know in advance how many they can take care of. We will see that the vacancies are taken up. I am most anxious to avoid complications and the sending of children to these schools that we know in advance won't stand up at all\".\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

I read with a good deal of interest the portion of Mr. Lariviere's letter quoted in your communication. The Administration most certainly will be glad to do all it can to co-operate in this matter of providing the Mistassini Indian children for Moose Factory School. However, our associations with Mr. Lariviere in the past have not always been satisfactory. In the minds of some of our missionaries is the certainty that he is hostile to our work, and my experience has been that he resents very much the work of the Church of England among the Indians in the Mistassini and Waswanipi areas.\n\nUnder the circumstances of past experience I feel that we would be most foolish to rely wholly upon the judgement of Mr. Lariviere as to how many and which children should attend the Moose Factory School. I beg to request that recommendations from missionaries and from the Administration receive your consideration as well as the recommendations of the aforementioned agent.\n\nAt the moment the Moose Factory school has 93 pupils. If Mr. Lariviere co-operated more with the missionary in the area during this past summer the pupilage at this school could quite easily have been brought up to the authorised number with hardly any more expense to the Church or Government.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nOctober 25th, 1948\n\nH.E.

I made arrangement to affect transfer on you, it is possible this child is now with you.\n\nHis record on general vaccinations is as follows:\n\nSMALLPOX: Not checked - if not done should be and results reported to Abitibi Agency.\n\nDIPHTHERIA & WHOOPING COUGH: Completed 6 injections.\n\nTETANUS AND DIP TYPHOID: Completed 4 injections.\n\nTUBERCULOSIS: Not vaccinated 1948.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.

Her father wanted commit suicide.\n\nCharlotte Shecapio\n\nIllegitimate - father said to be white from Chibougamau - mother an Indian, married to a feeble minded Indian; child came back from Chapleau with a fractured arm in plaster cast with request \"look after it\", other Indians cared for her - shelter in such cases.\n\nJohn Mark\n\nMother a widow - extreme poverty, assisted by us regularly.\n\nWesley Shecapio\n\na step mother - sick woman.\n\nPeter Nayassit\n\na step father - originally R.C. now said to be anglican - more or less rejected.\n\nThese kids came back most of them with nothing but the little clothes they had at Chapleau, after two months in bush living on the \"Indian orphan ticket at large\" I can assure you they were not presentable to any one, Mrs. McLeod the wife of the Manager of the Company, took an active part to wash them and clean them, before their departure to Moose Fort.\nAll these kids are fairly intelligent, unfortunately, having to put up with unusual conditions at home.\n\nThis class is a problem to all, however I am satisfied, the Indians realize more and more, that we are interested in the most unfortunate and year by year they are helping, amongst our primitives not many years ago this class, was considered as the \"future slaves\" and the conditions were in proportion with the idea, part of it was very visible on these children when I took the trouble to arrange that they return to school, more I am satisfied to say if I had not taken a very active part in it, they would have never went, for they are looked upon as a rule by the Indians as the \"rejected\" and no one cares much for them, it follows if not at school they are in hospitals.\n\nH.

This in the past caused considerable friction with the Indians and as you know it is not feasible to ask these primitives to spend a year in a Residential School; they have no idea what it is all about. Next, the cost of transportation in my opinion for immediate prevent providing for these Indians this type of education.\n\nI would appreciate that the situation be made very clear and if it is the intention of the Department to send some of the Mistassini children to Moose Fort School that I be advised and I will arrange, when at Mistassini.

Taylor,\nPrincipal,\nMoose Port Residential School,\nMoose Factory, Quebec.\n\nDear Rev. Mr. Taylor,\n\nI have yours of July 20th, 1949, informing that you can take over forty children from this Agency, this quota does not include children from this Agency, who remained with you for summer vacations for various reasons.\n\nI communicated with our Mr. B.F. Henry, Supt. of Education and we will endeavour to transfer the children, to fill in space allowed to Abitibi Agency.\n\nChildren that will go in, selection will be based on our medical records, which means in the majority of cases children vaccinated already against smallpox, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, typhoid & paratyphoid, or T.B., tested or vaccinated, briefly we have developed a method to protect our children at home or elsewhere, to limit possible and through this their health has improved a great deal. Like last year we will furnish you their standing - medical, I insist that no injections be given them, without our knowledge and based on information that we will furnish you, otherwise it will upset our records and cause children to suffer with shocks etc..\n\nDuring last season, we had three definite T.B. active cases with you, we are of the opinion, this took place through contacts with active cases in the school, in any event the parents of our children were much upsetted over this and caused difficulties, in this Agency we have put up a hard battle to stop out T.B. and we have reached the stage that we fear for contamination through others, I am given assurance that all possible measure will be taken this year to correct.\n\n[Signature]\n\nCopy for attention: Mr. B.F. Henry, t. selection.\nThe Mark boy as soon he can travel, I should be informed and I will arrange his transfer to our own service for T.B. treatment, the two Trapper girls are now being\n\nBriefly since a number of years, we have prepared our children to accept education and we are reaching the stage, it is going into operation, we can retain the good will of the Indians only by \"standing up\" to expectations, I am very pleased to hear that you are satisfied that this season a considerable improvement will be made at Moose. I am satisfied with good normal attention, we won't need to \"push them in\" they will go in by themselves. On medical etc., we enjoy their good will, on education and school attendance I am sure it can be worked out, although my Indians are definitely primitives.\n\nThese children will start to go in on about August 15th, we will provide escorts, etc., and advise you if at all possible a few days ahead of time. They won't go in altogether, likely groups of 10 or 12 and in some cases the parents themselves will escort groups, that is an adult a man or woman, Indian escorts if at all possible should be made to visit the school and informed as to how the children are doing, etc., so that they carry home a better \"understanding of things\".\n\nThanking you in advance, rest assured we will do our share.\n\nYours very Truly,\n\nH. Lartigue - Sup't Indian Agency.\nAugust 10.\n\nSuperintendent of Education:\n\nAdmission of pupils to Moose Fort school from Abitibi Agency: Letter on file down d/Aug 4.\n\nOur Mr La Riviere's zeal for the extension & health services is commendable but I think he requires instruction regarding the functions of medical officers, agents and school principals.\n\nWe made a note of one case (Harry Trapper) whom the agent said he would not send back to Moose Fort \"for medical reasons\" \u2014 some nurse's inoculation records. The visiting physician who in a way supervises the work told us in the agent's presence that there is no medical reason for the boy's not returning to residential school.\n\nI query also the idea of Moose Fort's being able to \"take over forty children from this agency.\" That would reduce the number of children from James Bay to fewer than sixty.\n\nI should like to have a study made of the \"turn-over\" of pupils at Moose Fort. We know already that the turnover of staff is high.\n\nC.A.P. Clark\nAugust 18th, 1949.\n\nMr. H. Lariviere,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nAmos, P.Q.\n\nRe: Moose Fort Indian Residential School\n\nReference is to your letter of August 10th regarding particularly Helen Heubon recently a pupil at Moose Fort Residential School and now hospitalized at Roberval.\n\nIt is noted that of 21 children who have attended that school, 4 are now active tuberculosis cases.\n\nThe Educational Survey Committee was impressed by the assistance you are giving to the medical authorities, who are directing an anti-tuberculosis drive in your Agency. They have suggested a study of the history of admissions and discharges from residential schools which serve the Indians of your agency, and this study is proceeding and will, I expect, involve consultation with those officials of the Indian Health Services who are particularly concerned with the Quebec and James Bay area.\n\nThe manifestations which you describe are not peculiar to your Agency, but occur elsewhere in Canada where over a really searching examination for tuberculosis by a physician is impracticable before the child leaves on the long journey to a\nresidential school. When an unexamined child arrives at a distant school, the attending physician sometimes finds it essential to keep the child under observation. Some cases, of course, deteriorate rapidly and no blame for those cases can rightly be attached to anyone.\n\nFor the present, therefore, pupils who are already enrolled at residential schools should return, unless a physician certifies they should not be returned for medical reasons.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

Taylor,\nPrincipal,\nMoose Port Indian Residential School,\nMoose Factory, Via Moosonee.\n\nDear Rev. Mr. Taylor,\n\nFrom La Barre today we sent on 5 kids escorted by an Indian David Frank, this will complete our understanding for this season, from here no new admissions, Helen Reuben, Francis Reuben, David Trapper, are not returning on account we had to hospitalize for tuberculosis since they returned home for vacations. Harry Trapper not returned on account being near of age for discharge, felt best not to return with others.\n\nI regret to hear you could have received about 8 to 10 more kids, at this time and until next season we cannot do anything about it. I note you are extremely pleased with the children sent you, and you state they are the best ever seen and cleanest, with me going to school or hospital, it almost an accepted rule by all \"wash up\" before you go.\n\nIn a few days, we will furnish you with complete records, as required and their HEALTH RECORD. Our children this year are made up 100% from method we have endeavoured to establish, last year they were made up, from children returning to school and a few new admissions, the new admitted in 1948, were selected on same basis as in 1949.\n\nBest assured we are anxious to send you only the best, for we feel it is the only outlet to get results.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. Lariviere\nSept. Indian Agency.\nAmos, Que.,\nAugust 29th, 1949.\n\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nYour No. 467-1 & 10 (E3) August 18th, 1949\nRe: Tuberculosis\nMoose Fort Indian Residential School\n\nI wish to thank you for yours. I am satisfied we will enjoy improvement. I do not wish to blame anyone for the conditions that prevailed last year at Moose, however in this Agency, through \"Medical Services\" we were allowed to establish our own method, and since the Agency has directed the service, we have established a complete follow-up method on T.B., as well as on general. To do so we had to put in a great deal of time and effort; however it is serving the purpose, that is it is the basis today for all our welfare, etc., and with it we placed ourselves to send to schools healthy and fully protected children; needless to say if we run across a new source of infection, within the territory, we attend to it ourselves; outside, we have to go through headquarters.\n\nA good example of what can happen, most recently at Mistassini, on \"blind\" selection, I was presented with 24 kids for Residential School; after going over our records I rejected 17. Our quota was filled only with fully protected children and of correct ages, and we still have a good number of children of the same category, but could not provide for. Briefly, without \"recorded history\", we would have sent in about 17 kids not fit to attend school, this only at Mistassini.\n\nI can assure you that if we had our own schools, we are in a strong position to fill them with healthy children of proper ages and our Indians will send them in. This year, I could have had over 100 only at Mistassini and Waswanipi, all in line with our preventive field services.\n\nH. Lefebvre, Supt.\nAbitibi Indian Agency.\nI wish to thank you for yours. I am satisfied we will enjoy improvement. I do not wish to blame anyone for the conditions that prevailed last fall, however in this matter, it was a \"school service.\" We were allowed to establish a school, and since we already had directed the service, we have established a complete follow-up system. As well as a record. Also so we had to put into effect all of this new effort, however it is via the purpose that it is to be used today for all our schools, etc., etc., etc., which has been done. We have sent to schools healthfully and fully educated children; needless to say if we had across a new source of learning within the territory, we attend to it ourselves; i.e., we have to do our best ourselves.\n\nIn conclusion, I will mention, I was pleased with the kind of substantial school, after all, over our heads. I mention that it is the first time with us, however, children are correct, etc., etc., still have a good number of children who are coming, but cannot get room for. Finally, what I said before, we shall have out in about 17 weeks, but it will be a good school only at intervals.\n\nI can assure you that if we had no more schools, we are in a very position to fill them up. Luckily children of good ages and our Indians will see them in. This year, I could have had over 100 but I missed one or two, I, all in the winter, now, the field services.\nI have just returned from a three-week visit to clear children (including only) of school who are not attending school next year.\n\nHere in London, I have not been able to turn their children, so I am writing to you to take note of the following:\n\n1. Many of them are still wearing \"out of the house\" clothing.\n\n2. Some are not wearing any clothes at all.\n\n3. Others are wearing clothes that are not suitable for the weather, such as thin trousers only, with rubber in their feet, to keep them dry.\n\nOn the straight of New York, Taylor recently wrote, I assured them this year it will be much better all around. Finally they agreed to let them go, but by Harry positively refused to return, but here he is again, refusing to go, but still there.\n\nThey also complained:\n\nTo me, and in presence of Nurse Brunet; I warned them not to complain if it was not correct or exact.\n\nHarry, who came back last year, upon my arrival at Moose School, they took me out of the serre pants, gave me a pair of trousers - black overalls, and I never seen or got back my blue serre pants. They did the same thing to my brothers George and David, for their good behavior.\nThe parents, Mr. and Mrs. Christiana Anderson, were present, following a statement by Mr. Anderson as follows:\n\n\"I am inclined to believe, the fact Henry did not want to return to school, didn't say anything, however convinced he is in some sort to his statement, that it is true, I feel it should be brought to your attention, for it creates a poor feeling among the Indians, they spread these rumors, etc., their statement incorrect they should be definitely checked on it. In this case their statement is rather strong, Mr. and Mrs. Anderson called Mr. Clark at once during visit at La Barre, Mr. Clark took a picture of the well tanks which the woman brought out from the tent that lay behind, near the front of the School.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLeriviere - Superintendent\nAbitibi Indian Agency.\"\nList of children transferred to\nMOOSE POST SCHOOL - August 1949\n\n| Name of Parent(s) | Band No. | Child's name | Age |\n|-------------------|----------|--------------|-----|\n| Blacksmith        | Do       | Mary Ann     | Feb 9 1939 |\n| Brien Billy       | Do       | Henriette    | May 26 1941 |\n| Jolly George      | Do       | Clara        | Aug 11 1938 |\n| Rabbitkin George  | Do       | Rose          | Apr 20, 1936 |\n| Sarah             | Do       | Diana        | Dec 26 1941 |\n| Longship (orphan) | Do       | Simon        | Jan 1 1941 |\n| Band No. 78       | Do       | William      | Sept. 10 1939 |\n| Ocon (Omo)        | Do       | Imine        | Feb. 16 1941 |\n| Ocon Johnny       | Do       | Imine        | Feb. 16 1941 |\n| Oconishish        | Do       | Johnny Etienne | Oct 15 1940 |\n| Matouch           | Do       | Allan        | Jan 5 1939 |\n| Guardian          | Do       | Abel         | May 18 1941 |\n| Potawatome        | Do       | Paul         | Dec 31 1948 |\n| Tropper Johnny    | Do       | Agnes        | Jan 29 1941 |\n| Shoepie Noah      | Do       | James Phillip | June 10 1937 |\n| Minocum Samuel    | Do       | Harry        | Aug 25 1941 |\n| Leon John         | Do       | Joseph       | June 9 1941 |\n| Matouch Vld.       | Do       | John         | Sept 1 1948 |\n| Shoepie            | Do       | Charlotte    | June 23, 1939 |\n\ncontinued...\n| Name                  | Band No. | Date       |\n|-----------------------|----------|------------|\n| Cooper Robert         | Waswanipi No. 1 | Aug 15 1936 |\n| Cooper Charlie (Wid)  | Do No. 8  | Allen      | Aug 31 1941 |\n| Shoepie Isaac Elizabeth| Do No. 4  | Waswanipi  | July 11 1940 |\n| Raymont Charles       | Do No. 69 | Peter      | Apr 6, 1939 |\n| Trepper Billy         | RG N/M    | Kitty      | Feb 5 1935 |\n| Cooper Alex           | Waswanipi No. 6 | Marguerite | Aug 9 1940 |\n| Blacksmith Ross Emily | Do No. 1  | Mario Eva  | Jan 5 1942 |\n| Kitchen Jeanie        | Do No. 7  | Harry      | May 14 1940 |\n| Gull William          | Do No. 10 | Ella       | March 9 1939 |\n| Joseph John           | Do No. 11 | Caroline Maggie | Nov 18 1941 |\n| Isomond Johnny        | Do No. 30 | Norman     | Feb 15 1941 |\n| Ottereyes Peter       | Do No. 21 | Billy      | Dec 26 1940 |\n| Otter Antoine         | Do No. 24 | James      | Nov 18 1939 |\n| Otter Richard Schoia  | Do No. 39 | Isabel Jane | April 10 1943 |\n| Gull San Helen        | Do No. 46 | Mary-Ann   | Aug 25 1941 |\n| Kitchen Willie (Wid)  | Do No. 58 | Salem      | Oct. 14 1939 |\n| Ottereyes Robert      | Do No. 83 | Jane Alice | Jan 27 1942 |\n| Trepper Lee Albert    | Do No. 43 | June       | March 14 1939 |\n| Sagamah Vollan Mary   | Do No. 34 | Maggie     | March 10 1939 |\n\n**CHILDREN WHO SPENT VACATIONS AT MOOSE PORT**\n\n| Name                  | Band No. |\n|-----------------------|----------|\n| Jeannie Mianseum      | Waswanipi Band No. 77 |\n| Mary Mianseum         | Do       | 77        |\n| Simon Mianseum        | Do       | 77        |\n| Ronnie Mianseum       | Mistassini | 87       |\n\nHospitalized during stay at School and did not return here\n\n| Name                  | Band No. |\n|-----------------------|----------|\n| John Mathew Mark      | Mistassini No. 168 |\n| Trepper Christine     | RG N/M    | ex Sonnetrow |\n| Trepper Frank         | N/M      | Do continued |\nSheet No. 3.\n\nAdmissions to Moose Port School\n\nBertha Trapper R.G. or La Barre (To Toronto)\nSophia Trapper (sent to Manitoba from Simpson School - never reported to Moose.

F. Neary, Supt., Education\n\nMoose Fort Residential School.\n\nAttached hereto copy of list covering our children now at Moose Fort School.\n\nOur \"bush experienced nurses\" escorted our children. They reported on the movement of these kids everything was almost perfect. The parents had provided as requested and had included the emergency ration asked for \"a little bannock and dried meat\".\n\nThey informed during their stay at the school, waiting for train, they found our children started already to complain about food. From information given me, it is evident they are given what might be called \"a city diet\"; our children were raised on fish and plenty of it and most of the time nothing else but fish and dried meat; needless to say, they can't very well adapt themselves over night.\n\nOur best hospitals caused us the same trouble. Finally after repeated visits, we got them to put in the fish and change the cooking of the meats for our Indians. Since they all say the food is exceptionally good. This includes now \"bannock\" with raisins or plain for Sundays. At hospitals we got them to change the refined cod liver oil to ours, in spite of the objection for the smell by the nurses. Now they use it and it works out.\n\nI would appreciate that the diet at Moose Fort School be adjusted to meet the habit and taste of our kids. I sunk\na lot of time on training Indians to accept this and that, through a little \"fish etc.\" I would not like part of my efforts wiped out. We have them now on the right path as regards sending their kids. I want to keep it that way and improve on it. In a few years that they take them in themselves. That is when our schools will be near them.\n\nH. Lariviere,\nSupt., Indian Agency\nSeptember 17, 1949.\n\nReverend Canon H. G.

CANON H. G. COOK, B.D.\n\nFile: M.F.-4\n\nYour File: 467-10\n\nSeptember 22, 1949.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRe: Moose Fort Residential School\n\nI have read with a good deal of interest Mr. Lariviere's letter of August 31st and realize the situation thoroughly. It is hard for bush Indian children to adjust to \"Whiteman's diet\". However there are two factors to be considered.\n\n(a) Department of Nutrition surveys recommend diets and as far as we are able we try to follow them. I know if we gave the children only the food they like we'd experience adverse criticism from Indian Health Services.\n\n(b) Fish, quantities to which the children of Mistassini and Waswanipi are accustomed, is not procurable at Moose. The fish just are not there.\n\nHowever I am leaving tomorrow for Moose Factory and Fort George and shall talk over the contents of Mr. Lariviere's letter with Principal Taylor and write you upon my return.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nBy the use of this method, we have established a basis, for assisting Indians, placing relief in proper hands and making it work to achieve improvements, we also use it as our basis for hospitalizing sick Indians and advising hospital hospital now often refers to us for information also local doctors, as regard school it allows proper selection, that is done away with the blind method of selection, take a chance have him examine after and so on, finally force the school to accept an unhealthy child or a costly return home.\n\nTaking a doctor in to Mistassini and Massawippi, to have children examined would cost about $1,000.00 and very likely we won't be able to get a doctor to go in whom wanted, next taking the kids out for examination, it would cost as much and who would look after them briefly with present method I feel it should give 100% satisfaction, all these costly delays and so on are avoided. Assuming a child requires on check at school medical care, it cost very little to have done on the spot. Our children being all vaccinated, T.B. tested and re-tested annually vaccinated and re-vaccinated against T.B., if they could be accepted our present method of selecting, I feel it would save all concerned lot of costly difficulties. In any event the group of kids sent out this year, taking in this area, and likely at most places same number of kids, whose ours would stand up high, on health etc., the staff at Moose when they saw them after long journey and tough travelling; were surprised to see such a fine lot of kids, best ever seen they said. Now that they have started moving to and on a school the new generation, I can assure are better, on teeth we had trouble we had a dentist, professor a Montreal University to visit various Bands, teeth trouble with time we will endeavour to remedy.\n\nOur medical follow up, today operate smoothly and if we could be relieved from that examination necessary on \"usual blind selection\", I think our \"school troubles\" would be within what we can take care of.\n\nH. Lariviere - Dept. Indian agency.\nSeptember 24th, 1949\n\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nYour No. 467-10 September 17, 1949\nMoose Fort School - Residential\n\nSince supplying the school and your office with list of children, we have forwarded to the Principal of the school, a complete record of our vaccinations on all children from this agency with him; this record indicated a very high standard, we have asked the Principal to complete, through local medical services, vaccinations, a few on smallpox, on all our children only 8 booster doses on diphtheria-whooping cough-typhoid combined, on all our children only 32 injections for complete typhoid-para-typhoid vaccinations, all new admissions are T.B. protected through B.C., as you know a child to receive B.C. vaccinations through severe tests must be healthy. With these records I am sure, our children can satisfy the most scrupulous medical officer.\n\nOn medical, allow me to take up a few minutes of your valuable time to\u2014\n\n1.- All Indians alive in Abitibi Agency, are followed up through a card system\u2014at birth they have a card.\n\n2.- All doctors, hospitals, treatments are recorded on these cards, as the accounts reach us.\n\n3.- All special treatments given in the field, by nurses, doctors, are recorded on these cards.\n\n4.- On tuberculosis, we have a permanent register and same register is combined for recording all types of vaccinations, we know of the value of various tests, year, and so on. This is equal to a Membership Roll\u2014but for medical only, if they get married etc., the recordings are transferred to their own numbers.\n\n5.- These records are brought to-date annually, field work record for following seasons prepared and our nurses have to complete current work and keep to-date and we are in position to know if it is done or not.\nMoose Factory, Ont.,\nSept. 20, 1949\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am attaching hereto application forms covering admission of 84 children to Moose Fort Residential School, Moose Factory.\n\nI am also attaching hereto application forms covering admission of 48 children to St. Philip's Anglican Residential School at Fort George, Que.\n\nJSA/C\nencl.\n\nSuperintendent\nJames Bay Indian Agency\nSeptember 24, 1949.\n\nMr. H. Lariviere,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nAmos, P.Q.\n\nRe: Moose Fort Indian Residential School\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 31st, regarding children proceeding to the Goose Fort School, we forwarded a copy of your letter to Canon Cook, Superintendent of the M.S.C.C., and I enclose for your information a copy of his reply.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nSeptember 28, 1949.\n\nMr. J.S. Allen,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nMoose Factory, Ont.,\n\nYour file 11-1 (44)\n\nI have your letter of September 20th in reference to application forms covering the admission of eighty-four children to the Moose Fort Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department is anxious to be certain that children are physically and medically fit for admission to a residential school before approval of the admission is granted.\n\nIn view of this, your applications are returned to be completed by a physician. When the Physical Examination Certificate is completed, the Department will be in a better position to reach a decision on the applications.\n\nIt is noted that in most of the cases the signature of the father is not shown. You should make every attempt to have these applications signed by the father or mother or provide a reasonable reason why this was not done in each case.\n\nWhen these applications are completed, please return. The Department will then be in a better position to give each application the necessary consideration.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nSeptember 28, 1949.\n\nMr. J.L. Whitney,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nChapleau, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant, the Department approves the admission of Clarence Cachagee to the Moose Fort Indian Residential School.\n\nAs only one copy of the application form is required, the duplicate is returned.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nTo Mr. Rev. H.-A. Taylor,\nPrincipal,\nMoose Port School,\nvia Moosonee, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Taylor,\n\nAttached hereto records, on vaccinations, our children, as they stood when they left for your school. This record, two copies sent you, when completed I would appreciate that one copy be returned to this office, so that we can complete and write up our PHARMACY RECORDS.\n\nUnder separate cover we are mailing you Vaccine, as used by us, by its use on our children it will avoid any possible complications, on smallpox, your local nurses can do with vaccine on hand, on small pox cases vaccinated they should be rechecked before recording, in case that they are not \"positive\".\n\nGoing over our record, you will find a certain number of children marked \"positive\" on BCG this means these children at one time were checked, and could not be vaccinated, on account they were positive on Volmer or PPD test, others with date - year only, they were BCG vaccinated or re-vaccinated. Under T.B., those who are marked, we have a positive definite proof, that a member in their families, were infected and died of T.B., others are blank, but in some cases they have a brother or sister suffering with T.B., or discharged as cured, if at any time the Medical Officer desired a report on any of them, we would be very pleased to furnish. According to this record, etc., only Jeannie Tamoum, is expected to not stand up, being a 3 plus, however with good care and food, she might develop a strong resistance and rebuild herself against T.B.\n\nThanking you in advance, nurses doing vaccination, all she has to do, is to fill in the \"sign space\" opposite each names, when left open.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. Lariviere - Supt. Indian Agency\nOctober 3rd, 1949\n\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nYour No. 467-10 (E1) September 1949\nRe: Diet - Moose Fort Residential School\n\nI wish to thank you for having taken the matter up with Rev. Cook. I note his remark as regard Indian Health Services, this service, I am sure will support fully, that our primitive Indian children be allowed plenty of fish and some bannock, otherwise these kids feel starved, the trouble starts on their return home etc., we know they are not starved, but nevertheless primitive Indian way of thinking about \"food\" is a matter that will take years to adjust next when these children return home, if they had too much \"whiteman\" food, once at home the parents have trouble with them.\n\nH.

Simon Longchamp of Matassini, Abitibi Agency\n2. David Trapper, Lacolle, Abitibi Agency\n3. Sydney Cheezo, Rupert House, James Bay Agency\n4. Hannah Goodwin, Albany Band, James Bay Agency\n\nJ.S.A.\nenclosure\nFollowing an outbreak of typhoid fever among the Indian children attending the Bishop Gordon Memorial Residential School, operated by The Church of England Mission, at Moose Factory, Ontario, the undersigned was requested by the Division of Indian Health Services to conduct a sanitary survey of the area and to assist the Medical Officer in determining, if possible, the cause of the outbreak and to recommend remedial measures in order to prevent a recurrence of such outbreaks.\n\nMoose Factory Island is located in the estuary of the Moose River some twelve miles from James Bay and two miles south of Woodcreek, the end of rail. The Island is roughly oval in shape and has an area of 1,133.3 acres. It is fairly level, about 22 feet in elevation above mean sea level and covered with second growth, spruce, poplar, birch and willow.\n\nThe settled and inhabited area of the Island is situated along the southwest side, the chief buildings comprising the Anglican School, small hospital, Anglican Church, R.C.M.P. Detachment, Hudson's Bay Company Trading Post, Roman Catholic Church and some seventy-six (76) Indian dwellings. The resident white population is thirty-six (36) in addition to three hundred and eighty-four (384) Indians, which are variable in number as they come and go.\n\nAttention was first given to making a careful investigation of the water supply and sewerage systems of the Anglican Mission, followed by a survey of the general sanitary conditions prevailing on this Island. In this connection it is desired to point out that general matters of sanitation on the Island would properly come under the supervision of the Health Department of the Province of Ontario, in which it is located. The environmental conditions directly affecting the health and welfare of the Indians could be considered a Federal responsibility.\n\nThe story of the development and progress of the epidemic, as recounted by the Medical Officer, may be briefly stated as follows: In August and September, Mr. Timney, employed by the School, became ill and was hospitalized at Cochrane. On September 20th, a resident pupil, Peter ________, became ill followed later by one of the girls on September 29th. Three (3) more girls became ill on October 1st. A short time later, the Archdeacon and Superintendent of the School, Mr. Cook, was sent to hospital at South Porcupine, being diagnosed and later confirmed on October 6th as suffering from typhoid fever. The previous cases were also confirmed as typhoid.\n\nOn this date certain prophylactic measures were put into effect by the Medical Officer. All drinking water on the Island was ordered to be boiled and excreta from the known typhoid patients was disinfected and buried in deep pits. Since that time one girl and two boys became ill with typhoid. No further cases have developed within the outside incubation period of thirty (30) days so that the preventive measures adopted have apparently been successful in stopping the progress of the epidemic.\n\nIn summary then, there are ten (10) patients hospitalized with typhoid, five (5) Indian girls, three (3) Indian boys, at the mission, Mr. Timney and Mr. Cook at other hospitals.\n\nThe Anglican Mission School has a staff of thirteen (13) with fifty-eight (58) resident pupils and twenty-five (25) day pupils. Following the outbreak of typhoid the day pupils were not allowed to attend school.\nThe school and auxiliary buildings stand at the end of the settlement. The source of water supply is the river, which is pumped and delivered under pressure to outlets in the Superintendent's residence and the foreman's residence. The flow varies between seven-hundred (700) and two-thousand (2,000) gallons per hour.\n\nThe intake and pumphouse are located at the River bend, south of the school building. The intake is located in a cross-channel of the river, the suction pipe being 1\u00bd\" galvanized iron extending about 20 ft. above covered with 5 ft. of water at low tide. The thickness of ice during the winter varies from 3 to 4 ft., and there is usually some physical damage done to the intake during the spring break-up.\n\nThe pumping equipment comprises an electrically operated (110 D.C.) reciprocating plunger pump with a rated capacity of approximately 900 gallons per hour. This is housed in a concrete pit on top of the river bank. The discharge line is a cast-iron pipe which runs to a 120 gallon pressure tank situated in the school basement with taps and branches to the various buildings. The system is automatic in operation and has a pressure range between 45 and 75 pounds per square inch.\n\nIn 1943 a hypochlorinator was ordered to provide treatment of the water supply and was placed in operation early in 1944. The unit is a hydraulically operated one, type HWS, manufactured by Wallace and Tiernan Company (New York). This feeds a chlorine solution into the discharge pipe from the pressure tank. The hypochlorinator operates when the pump is running by means of a solenoid valve on the distribution line from the pressure side of the tank. The hypochlorinator is situated ahead of the tank, which is regarded as satisfactory since there is provided for contact with the disinfecting solution.\n\nHowever, a careful study of the actual operation of the system disclosed there are several inherent defects in the present arrangement. One serious defect is the fact that the water pressure line operates in reverse rather than being piped directly from the pressure side of the tank. Water passes through a long loop of pipe, off which are taken all the main distribution outlets; the connection to the chlorinator is made at the end of the loop. When the pump was running and a tap was opened, it was noted that due to the drop in pressure occasioned by the opening of the small pipe there was frequently not enough pressure available to operate the mechanism of the chlorinator. This means that whenever water was drawn off during the pumping period, unchlorinated water was added to the tank. As this condition prevails quite frequently, it follows that only 50% of the water pumped from the river to the storage tank contains any chlorine solution.\n\nAt the writer's suggestion, the school board has considered making a pipe connection from the pressure tank directly to the chlorinator to ensure more positive action. In this connection it should be mentioned that an electrically operated hypochlorinator is provided which can be connected to the pump to ensure continuous contact.\n\nThe present method of determining the actual amount of chlorine present is much to be desired. At present, the only test used to determine the adequacy of chlorine in the water is to add a measured quantity of potassium iodide solution to a sample of water and observe the color, if free chlorine is present. The normal color standard for this test is that 0.5 mg/liter of chlorine will produce a blue color after five minutes contact.\n| Reference | Date |\n|-----------|------|\n| PA 123    | 1/1/47 |\n| PA 456    | 2/2/47 |\n| PA 789    | 3/3/47 |\n| PA 1012   | 4/4/47 |\n\nDO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6204)\n\nFile 467-10, part 1\nJames Bay Agency - Moose Factory - Moose Fort Schools - Admissions & Discharges, 1910 - 1938.\n\nFile 467-10, part 2\nJames Bay Agency - Moose Factory - Moose Fort Schools - Admissions & Discharges, 1939 - 1940.\n\nFile 467-10, part 3\nJames Bay Agency - Moose Factory - Moose Fort Schools - Admissions & Discharges, 1947 - 1949.\n\nFile 467-10, part 4\nJames Bay Agency - Moose Factory - Moose Fort Schools - Admissions & Discharges, 1949 - 1953.\n\nFile 467-23, part 1\nJames Bay Agency - Moose Factory - Moose Fort Schools - Deaths, 1940 - 1951.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6204)\n\nFile 467-10, part 1\nJames Bay Agency - Moose Factory - Moose Fort Schools - Admissions & Discharges.\n1916 - 1938.\n\nFile 467-10, part 2\nJames Bay Agency - Moose Factory - Moose Fort Schools - Admissions & Discharges.\n1939 - 1946.\n\nFile 467-10, part 3\nJames Bay Agency - Moose Factory - Moose Fort Schools - Admissions & Discharges.\n1947 - 1949.\n\nFile 467-10, part 4\nJames Bay Agency - Moose Factory - Moose Fort Schools - Admissions & Discharges.\n1949 - 1953.\n\nFile 467-23, part 1\nJames Bay Agency - Moose Factory - Moose Fort Schools - Deaths. 1940 - 1951.\n| Reference | No. | Name   | Date   | PA | Re | Date   | For Return Use |\n|-----------|-----|--------|--------|----|----|--------|----------------|\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n|           |     |        |        |    |    |        |                |\n\nDO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n| REFERENCE | DESCRIPTION |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| 9318      |             |\n| 45072     |             |\n| 3965      |             |\n| 5812      |             |\n| 98773     |             |\n| 11672     |             |\n| 14849     |             |\n| 20414     |             |\n| 36493     |             |\n| 22495     |             |\n| 3632      |             |\n| 4614      |             |\n\nDO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE\n\nIndian Affairs (File No. Volume 6204, File 367-10, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\nPay to: Mrs. Angus Macdonald\n\nAddress: Oxtelano River, Que.\n\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Sept. 5th  | To Letter claiming attached: Escort duty and assisting Nurse Hardy.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. dated:\n\nVoucher No. 252\n\nDate: February 17th, 1950, Agent\nFurther to my last ex. minister letter of January 16th, 1953, I have to report that the TB cases referred to in that letter are still under the jurisdiction of the hospital, but I have been able to secure certain of these cases from the following:\n\n- Jane Tucker\n- Lester Jeffries\n- Mr. Georgekiss\n- John Chisholm\n- Ruth Miller\n- Emily Georgekiss\n- Elizabeth Mark\n- Larry Ann Gull\n- Frances Cowboy\n\nThe latest X-ray shows no evidence of pulmonary TB.\n\n- Jane Tucker's case shows improvement in condition.\n- Lester Jeffries' case shows improvement in condition.\n- Mr. Georgekiss' case shows improvement in condition.\n- John Chisholm's case shows improvement in condition.\n- Ruth Miller's case shows improvement in condition.\n- Emily Georgekiss' case shows improvement in condition.\n- Elizabeth Mark's case shows improvement in condition.\n- Larry Ann Gull's case shows improvement in condition.\n- Frances Cowboy's case shows improvement in condition.\n\nPossible heart pathology, recommendations written.\n\nObservation for heart condition only.\n\n- Jane Tucker's case shows improvement in condition.\n- Lester Jeffries' case shows improvement in condition.\n- Mr. Georgekiss' case shows improvement in condition.\n- John Chisholm's case shows improvement in condition.\n- Ruth Miller's case shows improvement in condition.\n- Emily Georgekiss' case shows improvement in condition.\n- Elizabeth Mark's case shows improvement in condition.\n- Larry Ann Gull's case shows improvement in condition.\n- Frances Cowboy's case shows improvement in condition.\n\nDue to my absence from my office on various occasions and to the rush of other work, I have been tardy in getting these reports to you.\nReferring to my discussion with Mr. Long to have the other X-rays done at an early date, he advised that due to the unusual amount of work he had to do as acting principal and to faulty plumbing which prevented him from the proper preparation of his developing and fixing fluids he was long delayed in getting these other children x-rayed. This has been done only recently and the films are being sent to Toronto for a reading on the other six children who are on your list of twenty-one, viz: Clara Wiley, Beatrice Mark, George Stewart, George Outtitt, Lucy Sutherland, Lazarus Wilpin.\n\nI failed to note in my last letter that George Outtitt was returned last summer from sanatorium with recommendations that he be permitted to attend the school. My recommendation he be x-rayed was only routine.\n\nA summary of the above shows that the findings of these children are not sufficient to remove them from the school for health reasons. However, I have further to report that recommendations were made to keep under careful observation the following:\n\n[Names of children]\n\nThis will be done. None of them are serious enough for dismissal.\n\nI have to report that my nurses have done Tuberculin test on all the children living in at the school and only 3 were negative. I want the test run again during the next few weeks on each of our annual examinations at this school.\n\nMy nurses are also continuing with the inoculations which will be completed in due course. We will then be able to fill in the forms sent by Agent Riviere.\n\nDr. Simpson has been advised of the number of TB tests that are negative and have recommended that these be given BCG vaccinations. I am awaiting a supply of the same and directions for such from there.\n\nAll of which I respectfully reported.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n(C.C.) M.

Cochrane got excited (or desired a little publicity), at Cochrane, I am of the opinion it was no trouble to look after these 20 kids.\n\nThose left at Oskelance (Okalancee was out of flour, bread, etc., when the strike came on) 16 kids, I removed by aircraft on Sunday, provided for at Amos, at hospital, nurse was 1/3 of the kids, the kids themselves had lot of fun out of all this.\n\nOthers are at home, that is 94 from Waswanipi and other points, as soon conditions return to normal they will moved by normal and usual means of transportation.\n\nHad we not been caught with bad weather, all the Mistassini kids would have been landed at Moose Fort, on time, before the strike went into effect.\n\nH. Lapierre - Capt. Indian Agency.\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Children for Moose Port School\n\nFurther to telephonic conversation, the following was done:\n\n1.- Mr. Clark took care of the children at Cochrane - D and escort Miss. Midlige all at Moosonee now.\n\n2.- Nurse at Oskelance, with 16 kids, had to be removed, on Amos, via Senneterre, this work was done combined with other Agency affairs.\n\n3.- From Amos, we transferred to Moosonee, the 16 kids by air, one trip with permission from Department of Transport, to take number desired, providing we would not exceed maximum weight allowed for mileage to be done.\n\nAbove cleared all Mistassini children, the total cost won't exceed very much, the regular transportation.\n\nMr. Clark requested our aircraft to proceed to Nemaska, to take out via Senneterre a Mr. Jackman, Teacher, our aircraft landed at Nemaska, found party out fishing instead of standing by waiting. Pilot requested instructions, I advised to return to his base at once. He waited in view to locate, etc., but found he was away by about 15 miles, so it was useless to wait extra time. The Pilot had to make Waswanipi for the night, weather bad, Miss. Midlige returned with him, on an Agency combined trip Miss. Midlige was returned to Oskelance.\n\nAs regard the Waswanipi children, waiting at home, further to telephonic conversation, they will be sent out direct from Waswanipi to Moose Factory, from Senneterre to Waswanipi trip both ways, will be combined trip, medical etc., usual run. Department of Transport is being requested to authorize, on same condition as we did for the Mistassini kids. One trip only,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6204, file 467-10, part 4)\nThis will put us to-date fairly well,\nas regard the La Sarre kids, a few at Okaianee, they will have to wait\nuntil rail transport is resumed. Our quota for Mistassini - filled 36\nkids, Waawaniipi 17, might send in only 16 depending on weight and authority\nfrom D.O.T., on the line, we have sufficient kids, returning to complete\nour allowance 60 kids.\n\nFor your information, the situation with us, is\nagain about normal, at Okaianee, the Nurse and kids, came out, etc.,\nthis point is about the worse off on the line, they had no flour when\nstrike came on, also very low on other items.\n\nH. Lariviere - Supt. Indian Agency.\nAir Transport for stranded pupils, Moose Fort Residential School.\n\nOn Friday morning, August 25, I visited the office of the Austin Airways in South Porcupine and contracted with the pilot in charge for two and one-half trips (Cochrane to Moose Fort and return) to handle the twenty children and escorts.\n\nI escorted the first flight of children and was quite busy en route with air-sick children. Mrs. Farr supervisor F.C. Racicot accompanied another flight, and the original escort, Miss Eva Macdonald of Oskelano, also was flown to Moose Fort where she rode back to Amos in a plane that brought sixteen children from Amos. This plane may also have taken Mr. Jackman from Temiskwa to Amos.\n\nOn the last trip from Moose Fort to South Porcupine I brought out the two summer school teachers, Mr. Spurs and Miss McCaulle. Dr. Cosack of Health Services came out at the first opportunity.\n\nWe might have saved one trip by getting Air Transport Board authority to over-load the plane, but I thought you would prefer not to attract criticism of the handling of Indian children. Besides, telephone calls required special permission and I would have had to negotiate with a Toronto office.\n\nIn all 36 children were transported (20 from Cochrane and 16 from Amos). On the phone Mr. Dept. Lariviere told me he would defer sending the remaining 24 g his quota until the railroads are again operating.\n\nC.A.T. Clark\n\nIndian Affairs.

This year, at Moose, only one child not tested on TB and another tested but reading two plus, which means we should have same results as last year: no deaths, etc.\n\nI must note recently they reported one child suffering with a fracture (arm). Previously, we had a similar case. This always causes trouble amongst Indians for they feel supervision is not to the point.

School,\nMoose Fort via Moosonee, Ont.,\n\nI am returning your September Quarterly return as it is impossible to work out the average attendance of pupils during the Quarter.\n\nIt is a common procedure to show the girls on one set of returns and the boys on another with double spacing between the names. When re-submitting this return this rule should be put into practice.\n\nIt has been noted that a large number of pupils have been discharged from residence effective September 1. As these pupils were in residence during the June Quarter the school is entitled to a grant of sixty-two days each, that is, for July and August. You have omitted to claim this grant; therefore, it is suggested that when the return is being re-written the pupils you propose to charge or pupils that have not returned to residence be included on the return and grant claimed for sixty-two days.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the re-written return was forwarded to this office as soon as possible so we would like to have all the grants for residential schools paid prior to November 15.\n\nBernard F.

(RQ 10, Volume 6204, file 467-10, part 4)\nOttawa, November 18, 1950.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nRe David Koomayuk, Disc No. K4-364, Eskimo age 15\n\nIn February, 1949, a fifteen year old Eskimo boy, David Koomayuk, was flown by mercy plane from Creswell Bay on Boothia Peninsula to the Dr. Charles Camsell Memorial Hospital in Edmonton suffering the loss of both feet from gangrene. Since then he has been fitted with artificial limbs and is now able to move around quite freely. During his stay in hospital he has been taking advantage of the educational opportunities provided, and has learned to talk English fairly fluently already. He has received considerable amount of publicity due to his rather extraordinary progress for he is considered particularly brilliant. He has started Grade 3 arithmetic and in his reading has almost completed his Grade 2 reader.\n\nUnfortunately, a short time ago he contracted a slight case of tuberculosis, but this has been cleared up and Dr. Falconer advises that the boy will be ready for discharge about January 1, 1951.\n\nI am attaching herewith a copy of a letter I am sending to Dr. Moore. In this you will notice that the suggestion has been made that David should be placed at Moose Factory in order that he can attend the school there and also have the benefit of the medical service available at the hospital.

(RG 10, Volume 6204, file 467-10, part 4)\nOttawa, November 18, 1950.\n\nDear Dr. Moore:\n\nI have received a copy of Dr. Falconer's letter to you dated October 10 in which he advises that the above-named Eskimo boy, approximately fifteen years of age, should be ready for discharge about January 1, 1951. The question of David's immediate future was discussed between Mr. Bailey of this Administration and Dr. Falconer recently when it was learned that Dr. Falconer was not too anxious to see this boy return to the rigorous climate of the north too early. He suggested that it would be preferable for this young Eskimo to be placed in a residential school for the next year or two if possible close to a medical centre.\n\nThe problem of this boy's placement has been discussed with both Dr. Simpson and Dr. Procter, the latter of whom suggested that David might be sent to Moose Factory where he could attend school and be close to the hospital there. Furthermore, he might very well work himself into a reasonably good job either as an interpreter or clerk. At the same time being at the gateway to the Eastern Arctic, it might be easier to obtain a position for him in one of the Hudson's Bay Company posts if that became possible at a later date. Dr. Simpson has stated that he is in agreement with such a plan.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would ask Dr. Falconer to discuss this matter with David and ascertain whether this plan would be agreeable to the boy. In the meantime, a copy of this letter will be sent to Colonel Neary, Indian Affairs Branch to determine whether some arrangement might be made at Moose Factory for him at the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDr. P.E. Moore,\nDirector of Indian Health Services,\nDepartment of National Health & Welfare,\n702 Booth building,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6204, file 467-10, part 4)\nIt would be appreciated if you would advise me whether some arrangement might be made at Moose Factory through your services there for David's care.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nfor Director.\nNovember 30, 1950.\n\nThe Director,\nNorthern Administrations,\nDepartment of Resources and Development,\nNorlite Building, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: David Koomayuk, Disc No. E4-384,\nEsikimo Age 15\n\nWith reference to Mr. Wright's letter of November 18th, the Indian Affairs Branch has no objection to placing the above boy in the Moose Port School.

Our last arrangement was as follows:\n\n1.- Selecting children - Based on our medical records, free of T.B. and fully protected against contagious diseases - preventable by vaccination - also of a certain degree of intelligence. This to be done by AGENCY.\n\nThis method has given best results - none of our kids died etc., since.\n\n2.- Transport arrangement.\n\n3.- Can the children return home every summer?\n\n4.- The Residential school should favor us with results - Examination at end of year - indicate degree of intelligence, etc., for I feel a child cannot learn anything at school, it is useless to keep on sending him, when others could replace and do well.\n\nAt Mistassini and Massawippi, we have reached the stage now, only children of school age, about 7, are available, this class is well protected etc., considering number ready, we can select among the most promising kids.\n\nThanking you in advance, I am leaving today for Mistassini, to return Amos on about July 1st.\n\nH. Lariviere - Dept. Indian Agency.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6204, file 467-10, part 4)\nJune 25, 1951.\n\nMr. F. Phelan  \nSupt. of Education  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDept. Citizenship & Immigration  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRe: Abitibi Agency children at Moose Factory\n\nThe Administration, each June, requires an annual report from each of its School Principals. The Rev. H. Seegmiller, Principal of the Moose Fort School, under the question \"comments or suggestions re pupils\" has answered as follows:\n\n\"Mr. H. Lariviere, the Superintendent of the Abitibi Agency has been most cooperative. He seems however, to have a tendency to give us a different group of children each year. This fills the school year down and does not give the promising children an opportunity of advancing as quickly as they should. Perhaps I.S.A. office could write to him at his office in Amos asking his assistance at consecutive schooling for the children from his Agency.\"\n\nI have not written Mr. Lariviere but have given you Mr. Seegmiller's comments instead. They are, I think very practical and sensible and I've been wondering if anything can be done to have the same pupils returned to the school after the holidays rather than a large proportion of new ones. All Mr. Lariviere is doing on behalf of the Anglican children of the Mistassini-Wawanapi country is certainly appreciated and we are not complaining at all but just wondering if the main purpose of operating residential schools is not being somewhat defeated when pupils are frequently changed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent\nCopy for attention: Mr. F. Phelan, Sept. Muscylon Division 467-10\n\nAugust 25th, 1911.\n\nRev. Mr. Campbell, Principal,\nMuscowequan Indian School,\nMuscowequan, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn connection with the transfer of the children from Mistassini to Moose Fort School, on my arrival at Muscowequan I found that our previous understanding had not been lived up to, that is selecting the children. This part you will recollect was definitely understood the Agency would carry out, based on medical records.\n\nOn the children transferred I forget to note child from Henry, Isaac Joseph, Charlotte Joseph, Samuel Joseph, David Thomas, Sarah Judith, Isaac Coon and Billy Coon who were ill and should have remained at home. Hope that they are recovering, quickly and be able to attend school shortly.

Normally, only twenty-nine pupils names should be entered on each page.\n\nIt will be appreciated that on receipt of the Quarterly Return, the Department Treasury officials and the Auditors check and make notations on this Return. When the Return is single spaced, it is difficult to identify the notations made on it. In future, if a Return is forwarded to this office single spaced, it will be returned for retyping.\n\nPupils 269-278 and 281-288 are entered on the Quarterly Return but are not shown on Form I.A. 411. Will you kindly advise the Principal to forward a supplementary I.A. 411 covering these children as soon as possible.\n\nThe Principal has claimed sixty-two days grant for pupils 0242 and 0245. As these children were not in residence during the June Quarter this grant can not be allowed.

As you know since we are sending children to \"boarding school\", we protected ourselves and the children by sending kids, protected to the limit possible, selecting on our \"Health records\", unfortunately this year, some of them were sent without our approval, that is, the following and \"infected\", they require special attention, if at all possible they should be completely examined by Dr. McLean, and given x-ray check often comparing with the others.\n\n| #   | Name          | Age |\n|-----|---------------|-----|\n| 6   | Billy Long    | 2   |\n| 9   | Matthew Abel Long    | 3   |\n| 9   | Daisy Long    | 3   |\n| 20  | Anna Neponsh  | 3   |\n| 20  | Neponsh Charlotte | 2   |\n| 51  | Emma Hagg     | 5   |\n| 87  | Anna Lee Long | 8   |\n| 61  | Anna Coon     | 8   |\n| 105 | Samuel Hagg   | 3   |\n| 105 | David Boon    | 3   |\n| 152 | Sarah J.

Allan,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nMoose Factory, Ont.,\n\nWith reference to the June Quarterly Return for the Moose Port Indian Residential School, you are advised that we are allowing 37 days grant for pupil # 198 due to the fact that the Principal did not claim 30 days hospital grant to which the school is entitled. We have allowed 16 days grant for pupil # 199 who was admitted to hospital on March 15. 21 days grant was allowed for # 220 who was admitted to hospital on March 22nd. 37 days grant was allowed for pupil # 266.\n\nPlease advise the Principal that on future returns the school is entitled to 30 days hospital grant effective the date the pupil was admitted to hospital.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nThis is to advise that I am informed by the Principal of Moose Factory Indian Residential School that Charles Cachagee is now ready for High School. It is suggested that he be transferred to Shingwauk School, at Sault Ste. Marie, and as his brother Michael continues Grade 9 in the fall term, it is thought that both of these boys should be transferred to Shingwauk.\n\nMr. Seegmiller also feels that Jean Davies, who is 14 years old should have a chance of school and recommends that she be transferred from Moose Factory Indian Residential School to Shingwauk, if it is at all possible.\n\nMay consideration please be given to these transfers and let me have your views in this matter in order that arrangements may be made with Shingwauk before the fall term.\n\nWill you please advise.\n\nJ.

This boy has a brother who has completed Grade 7 and will be taking Grade 8 work this coming term. Mr. Allan has requested that he be transferred with his brother.\n\nPlease advise whether sufficient space is available in the Shingwauk Home and whether the Principal is prepared to accept the two boys.\n\nfor Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAugust 11, 1952.\n\nMr. J.S. Allan,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nMoose Factory, Ont.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of August 4th regarding the transfer of three children from the Moose Fort Indian Residential School to the Shingwauk Indian Residential School, you are advised that we are writing Superintendent Laurence regarding Charles and Michael Cachagee asking him whether sufficient space is available in the Shingwauk school to accept these two boys.\n\nWhen we hear from Mr. Laurence you will be advised accordingly.\n\nWith reference to Jean Davies our records indicate that this girl is only in Grade 4 and is 14 years of age and we do not see any necessity for her transferring to the Shingwauk School. If this girl is considered to be a problem case, it is hardly fair to the Principal of the Shingwauk school to transfer her to his school as it is likely that he has similar cases to contend with.\n\nFor Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAugust 15th, 1952.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIn reply to your letter file 467-10 (E6)\ndated August 11th, 1952, this is to advise that Mr.\nWickenden, Principal of the Shingwauk Indian Residential\nSchool, has notified me that he has accommodation for the\ntwo Cashago boys from the Moose Port Indian Residential\nSchool.\n\nR.P.O.

The Indians at Mistassini particularly delayed their departure for their trapping lands, which caused poor feeling, etc. At Kasawipi, the same difficulty was experienced, but it was not as serious. During summer it was understood with Bishop Clarke I would be given definite quota early in August, and date of admission to be definitely fixed. With that it would have been easy to arrange and cause no friction. We know nothing yet about the children who were returned to school; it follows we are running into complications, parents, family allowances, etc., etc. We understand the staff is changed at Moose Factory school. However, through our nurse, we hope to establish a definite record. On her return, copy of 'em, you.\n\nH. L\u00e9vi\u00e8re - Superintendent\nAbitibi Indian Agency.\n\nc.c. to Mr. A.J.

Matters,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nEnc.\nMoose Factory, Ont.,  \nNovember 6, 1952\n\nMr. F. Matters,  \nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,  \nNorth Bay, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Matters:\n\nComplying with request contained in your wire of Saturday, October 18th, I have to advise you as follows:\n\nI discussed with Father Houle, on Tuesday morning, the question of transferring these children from the Fort George P.C. Residential School to Moose Fort. He stated that he had not received any word from the Bishop in this connection and would be contacting him in the evening. I explained to Father Houle that this was the wishes of the Department but I would be willing to detain my flight to Fort George for a day or so in the event that there may be any further developments. Not hearing from Father Houle by Saturday, I arranged for the trip to Fort George and left in the evening reaching Rupert House where I stopped over for the night. I arrived at Fort George at 12:35 Sunday morning and immediately made contact with Father Couture, presenting your wire regarding situation of the children now in his care. He informed me that he would not release these children without the authority of the Bishop and he also stated in any case they would not be able to return with me due to the fact that they were on a picnic. He further stated that he would only release the children on the authority of the Bishop or the parents of the children. Due to the fact that it was the close of the season and the pilot was afraid of being frozen in we had to return immediately without the children.\n\nAfter my return here, Father Houle informed me that two of the children were in hospital and four had been returned to their parents at Fort George. The other 4 children belonging to Rupert House would be returned to their parents at Rupert House by plane or snowmobile. Father Houle advised me that he had\nreceived this information from Father Couture through the Hudson Bay Co. radio and he would send me a letter of confirmation. To date I may advise that no confirmation has been received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.S. Allan\nSuperintendent\nJames Bay Indian Agency\n\nCC: Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa,\nMoose Factory, Ont.,\nOctober 25, 1952.\n\nRev. Father Houle, O.M.I.,\nMoose Cree, Ont.\n\nDear Father Houle:\n\nThis will confirm our conversation of Tuesday afternoon with regard to 10 children now at your Fort George Residential School.\n\nI may advise that I have been informed by our Regional Supervisor that the admission of these children into your school has not been authorised. I have been instructed that they be removed to Moose Fort Residential School at the earliest possible date. The names of these children is as follows:\n\n- Gertie Blackned\n- Poderick Blackned\n- Henry Diamond\n- Lawrence Melatche\n- Sam Kitty\n- Nellie Duff\n- Billie Rupert\n- Andrew Sam\n- Margaret Pasiniquon\n- Stewart Matches\n\nFrom our conversation I gather that you were getting in touch with Bishop Beileau with regard to this matter, and not having heard any further from you in this connection, I am proceeding to Fort George this afternoon to pick up these children as I have been directed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.S.

Matters,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n269 Main Street W.,\nNorth Bay, Ont.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of December 2 regarding application for admission forms for new pupils admitted to the Fort George R.C. Indian Residential School, we would like to review the correspondence on this matter:\n\n(a) On November 15th the following telegram was sent to Superintendent Allan: \"Re September Quarterly Return for Fort George R.C. Residential School have not received necessary applications for admission for pupils 69-88, 092-0106 Stop Grant claimed for these will be disallowed until applications received Stop Advise when these can be expected Stop\"\n\n(b) Attached is a list of pupils with the respective register numbers who were shown on the September Quarterly Return for the first time. These pupils do not appear on the June Return for this school. You will notice that the register numbers are the same as those referred to in the telegram.\n\n(c) On November 19 we received a telegram from Superintendent Allan reading \"Retel application for admission forms covering peoples mentioned were taken by Matters last visit\".\n\n(d) On receipt of this telegram we wrote a letter to you dated November 29 as it was presumed that you have all the applications for the children in question.\nIn your letter of December 2 you indicated that you had forwarded the applications for the Protestant children who were at the Fort George R.C. Residential School. We have received these applications and the children opposite whose names the X appears are the children for whom we have already received the applications. Applications for admission are required for the other children listed on the attached.\n\nWith reference to the sixth paragraph of your letter of December 2nd you may be very definitely assured that the Department does not pay Per Capita Grant for any children whose admission to a particular residential school has not been officially approved. Attached is a circular which was sent out to all the field officials and Indian Residential School principals indicating this policy and in no instance is Per Capita Grant paid when the admission of a pupil to a residential school has not been approved.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT Moose Port + Ancliean\n\n| No. | Name          | School During | Date of Admission | Periods in the School | State of Education | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----|---------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n|     | Henry Cowboy  | Rupert's House | Nov. 5/21         | 12 Months             |                    |                       |\n\n**Note:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return; and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\n---\n\n**PUBLIC ARCHIVES**\n\n**ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES**\n\n**CANADA**\nJanuary 19, 1953.\n\nMr. J.S.

One copy of the Return is all that is required.\n\nOn Form I.A. 411, the Principal has included pupil # 302 Henry Cowboy, however, this boy's name does not appear on the September Quarterly Return nor do we have an application for admission for him. Please advise who this boy is and why his name was included on I.A. 411.\n\nFor pupils 248 and 0299, the Principal has claimed less than the prescribed number of days in the Quarter and for pupils # 0253, 0289 and 0317 the Principal has claimed ninety-two days grant and for all of these pupils he has indicated they were in hospital but he has not shown the period of absence. In other words he has not indicated the date on which these children left residence and later returned if they did return. Without this information we are unable to pay the Per Capita Grant for them. In order to avoid delaying payment of the Per Capita Grant for the whole Return we are disallowing the grant claimed for the above-mentioned children until the matter is clarified. The Principal may claim retrospective grant for these children on the March Return but he must indicate in the Remarks Column the reason for his action, the reasons for the pupils' absence and the required dates.\nIn many instances it is noted that the children were ill during the Quarter, however, the Principal has neglected to indicate whether these children remained in the school during their illness or were returned home or placed in a hospital. Please advise regarding each of the pupils. If any of the children were placed in hospital or sent home it will be necessary to indicate when these pupils left school and later returned to school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Moose Factory Anglican Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Carney\nEnglish name: Henry\nAge: 13/4\nName of Band: Rupert's House\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: 7\nFather's full name and No.: Joseph No. 7\nMother's full name and No.: Daisy No. 7\nParents living or dead: Living\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: Protestant\nDoes applicant speak English?

The Indians for this are not to be blamed at all. They remained at Mistassini, waiting for transportation. Finally those that could not hold out any longer left for their trapping lands; more, one family left a child with another family without transportation. Finally he could not be taken. That particular child had to winter away from home. The difficulties caused us last year were discussed with Right Reverend Bishop Clarke and I hope it will never repeat itself. I might add it prevented one family from reaching their trapping lands, and during winter we had to fly supplies to them.\n\nFor Mistassini, the children should be removed on August 15th; for Waswanipi, immediately after.\n\nPlease let us know if possible by return of mail how many children you can take care of this coming year from Abitibi Agency. All told. And we will arrange that they are on hand.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

McKone,\nMedical Superintendent,\nMoose Factory Indian Hospital,\nMoose Factory, Ontario.\n\nDear Doctor McKone,\n\nER-117 Matthew Saunders-Eskimo\n\nThis boy was admitted to the Naval Hospital in Halifax in October 1948 apparently suffering from the aftermaths of poliomyelitis. He was treated at the Polio Clinic of the Victoria General Hospital in Halifax and returned to the Naval Hospital where he has remained up until this time. His condition is now such that while apparently in a cast, he is able to get around and should be getting some schooling. However, this must be carried out where he can have the attention of a surgeon for his case about every three months. It was arranged some time ago that the boy should be admitted to the Indian Residential School at Shubenacadie but it appeared that there was not suitable accommodation for him there and it was subsequently decided that he should go to Moose Factory.\n\nThe Administrative arrangements are rather complicated in that this Eskimo boy, whose home is at Fort Chimo, is a responsibility so far as educational matters are concerned, of the Native Administration and they in turn have arranged with the Educational Division of the Indian Affairs Branch to have him admitted to a Residential School. We believe that all the administrative problems should be left in the hands of the Indian Affairs Branch and the school authorities but we must keep abreast of his medical condition, being prepared to change the cast as required or, if necessary, to have him seen by an Orthopedic surgeon. We do not have any case history on our file and if it would appear necessary to have such it will be necessary for you to communicate with the Principal Medical Officer of H.M.C.S. Stadacona, Halifax.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.E. Moore, M.D., D.P.H.,\nDirector, Indian Health Services.\n\ncc. Mr. Allan\n\n/CF\nJuly 29, 1953.\n\nDoctor P.E.

The School, at the present time, is closed down as the school staff are on holidays and there they are not in a position to take care of this patient.\n\n\"I have discussed the matter with Dr. McKone and regret that it is not possible for us to take care of this Eskimo in our School at the present time.\"\n\nI regret that it has not been possible for us to be of assistance to you in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6204, file 467-10, part 4)\nDear Reverend Sir,\n\nIn connection with admission and discharge of Indian children attending Bishop Borden School, we find the admission date as fixed now is a cause of difficulties to all concerned. To solve the problem you suggest that the school close on June 15th and re-open on August 15th. I think this would be in line with the needs and prevailing conditions at Mistassini and Waswanipi, as it appears you cannot overcome the fact that the staff must have two months off, also the children.\n\nI suggest that you discuss the matter with Reverend Bishop Clarke and Reverend Canon Cook, and if you can arrive at something definite refer the matter to the Superintendent of Education in Ottawa.\n\nThe Indians at Mistassini particularly must get on the move to return to their trapping lands by early August, and they cannot very well leave children with others trapping closer to Mistassini awaiting for transportation and so on. The same remark applies to Waswanipi, although here they can wait a few days, etc.\n\nWhen at Mistassini and Waswanipi recently arrangements were made for children to return and be on hand for dates as called for by you. I might add the Indians at Mistassini were not too happy about it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nM.
