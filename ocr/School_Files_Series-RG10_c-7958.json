Neary,\n\nThe two furnaces in the Fisher River two room Day School are in very poor condition, and will have to be replaced at once, as they are beyond repair. I had Mr. Campbell of the Campbell Heating Company check them over, and I am attaching herewith his letter - giving a quotation on two new furnaces. These furnaces are very hard to get, and Mr. Campbell advises me that they could only secure a #21 and a #23.\n\nI am unable to get another price on these furnaces, as the firms will not go to Hodgson to check the furnaces. However, I consider Mr. Campbell's price of $1,615.00 quite reasonable, as these are large furnaces and a lot of new piping will have to be fitted in the basement.\n\nWill you please advise me as soon as possible regarding this matter, as this school has been newly decorated last summer, and it is impossible to use the present furnaces without smoking up the building; also they might cause a fire at any time. I would appreciate it if you would wire a reply, so I can have these furnaces installed without further delay.\n\nR. S.

If a teacher's whole duty was confined to the class-room Your Lordship's remarks might be justified, but as Your Lordship is aware this is not the case and as Your Lordship is further aware the Department has of late been asking for the appointment of teachers who will give their whole time to the school work.

I would be obliged if I could read the request of the Indians in this matter, as I, from what I know, do not think there is any good reasonable ground for this request. I was present at a meeting where this matter was mentioned, but I intimated that I could not agree with them, as I felt they were not acting right. I have always found the present teacher, the Rev. C.H. Fryer very kind to the children and to the parents, occasions do arise where he has to act with some firmness, but I feel sure that he always tempers his action with justice and kindness. He will not accept any dictation from the Indians in the disposal of the destitute relief, and this is resented. I have found that his judgement in this destitute business, is invariably good, and the supplies used under his direction are used to the best advantage. His independance in not listening to the Indians, has made them feel unkindly, and they think they will have the handling of this if they can get Mr. Fryer out of the way. I am pretty well certain that a clique want to get an Indian by the name of Jeremiah Henderson, Son of Counsellor John Henderson in as teacher; this man was an utter failure at Black River, and I think that it is not possible to compare him to Mr. Fryer in any way as a teacher. And then again Mr. Fryer acts in a very acceptable and capable manner as dispenser, he is patient and works hard for the whole of the people in this work and does good service. The scheming against Mr. Fryer is not a unanimous wish of the Band and I have no hesitation in claiming that it would be hard to get as good a man to do the work that Mr. Fryer does so well and so attentively for these people, and many of them are his friends and are grateful.\nto him. I would not entertain their request, and cannot endorse it at all. This is a matter that they have been agitating in a small clique, but so far as I know is not wide in its influence among them. Mr Fryer will not take any notice of this ingratitude but he endeavors to smooth it down, some of the Indians take this as a mark of fear, which is a great mistake, as Mr Fryer's record with the Band is able to stand any fair enquiry. I would suggest to this Band that the Department is well satisfied with Mr Fryer's services, and that reports corroborate this. I might also say that if you wish to look further into this matter, I would refer you to Inspector Bunn.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nClandeboye Agency\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 22, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your petition of the 2nd instant asking for a change in the teacher of the Upper Fort Alexander Day School I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to make any change at this school, as the services of the Rev.

It is not that we have any spirit against our present teachers. But it has been the promise of the government to the Indians that when they find that our teacher was doing unsatisfactory work it would be our duty to report right way to the Department, and they would see to it that a change would be made.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6234, file 512-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nWe also beg to inform you that from January to March the school was only open for teaching for thirty-one days this. We reported to our agent last winter at one of our meetings, but both our agent and the Indians, particularly Louis Severs, do pay any attention to it. Also during the school terms of 1916 the school was only opened for teaching for only 4% of the term, and you will see for yourself that during that winter only \u00bc card of wood used, for the school, so this tells for itself how long the school was opened during that time if Mr. Fyfe was teaching even doing school work to the satisfaction of the band. We want not write the department, for a change of our present teacher but we have a reason to ask for a change, so hoping the department will be fit to grant us our request right away as we would like the children to be taught in a better manner since more opportunity in the future also acting your reply.\n\nWilliam M.

Jeremiah Henderson was formerly the teacher at the Black River Reserve, but the Indians were not satisfied with him, so he was discharged, and he is now trying to get in at Fort Alexander.

It is realised, however, that the latter is a competitive point, and that motors brought by way of Emerson could be landed, possibly, somewhat cheaper than by way of Portage and Moose Jaw. They point out, however, that they have their Head Office in Regina, and are in a position to give quick and efficient service if parts should be required at a moment's notice.

Fryer is doing all that can be done under the circumstances. There is only a small attendance at the school and it should not be beyond the capability of one man to handle, and the investigation of the complaint of the Indians does not suggest to me that any change is needed at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

C. H. Fryer, teacher of the Fort Alexander Indian Day School, I beg to say that Mr. Agent Latulippe, in a report on his inspection of this school in November, last, drew attention to this matter. The Department has communicated with His Lordship the Bishop of Keewatin, under whose auspices the school is conducted, relative to the classroom activities being carried on by Mr. Fryer.\n\nWe note you state that Mr. Fryer is doing all that can be done under the circumstances, and that the complaint of the Indians does not suggest that any change is needed at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I wrote only yesterday to the Deputy Superintendent General concerning this matter as I had heard of some action having been taken and I had had no official information, and did not know just what the situation was.\n\nIn reply to your inquiry I beg to state that the arrangement by which Miss Fryer has taught in the afternoons was made long before I became Bishop, and I understand was made at the beginning of Rev. Mr. Fryer's occupation of the position of teacher. I have always taken it for granted that it was so arranged with the knowledge and consent of the Department especially as the school has been inspected at regular intervals. If this is not so I can only express regret. At the same time the arrangement, while open to criticism, was probably the best that could be arranged under all the circumstances.\n\nAs soon as I hear more fully from the Department I will go into the whole matter and see what can be done to secure efficient conduct of the school. This may mean that a teacher other than the missionary will have to be secured and a house convenient to the school provided. I would suggest that matters stand as they are till the New Year at least.\n\nMost faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is Miss Fryer's lack of control that is causing the Department concern. As you have pointed out, the development of water power in this locality suggests that we seriously consider improving our service to the Indian children, and I should be grateful if Your Lordship in due course would let me have a recommendation.

The report on the whole is not satisfactory and I would draw your attention to the Inspector's statement that the children have learned very little and the attendance is very bad.

I would say that there is a necessity for a change of some kind at this point. Inspector Dunlop's report of a year ago on this school would indicate that Mr. Fryer was getting better results than than now. I am hoping that with the appointment of a new agent at Clandeboye more interest will be taken in seeing that the children attend school. I think perhaps we are weak on this end of the work.\n\nW. M.

Hartwood, teacher at the North Pigeon Indian Day School, in reference to the school at Fort Alexander, and he has expressed a desire to make a change owing to the water supply. I am therefore subject to your approval of him, nominating him for appointment to the above school. As the house at Ft. Alexander is not furnished, he asks me to inquire whether the Department will not provide stores and such furnishings as was done in case of the Pigeon schools. He also desires to know what salary will be given by the Department.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6234, file 512-1, part 2)\nOttawa, September 27, 1927.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 26th instant, with reference to the possibility of Mr. Charles R. Harbord accepting the Fort Alexander Indian Day School. This arrangement is satisfactory to the Department, provided Mrs. Harbord will undertake the classroom duties. In fact, I believe it would be advisable to appoint her as teacher and have the salary go to her. Please let me know if this is satisfactory to Your Lordship. You might telegraph if the change is to be made in the immediate future, so that I can get in touch with His Grace the Archbishop of Rupert's Land regarding the appointment of a worker for the Peguis North Indian Day School. Salary at the rate of $750 for the ten teaching months will be allowed.\n\nThe Department is prepared to allow a grant of $150 for a stove and the heavier furniture required at the Fort Alexander teacher's residence. I consider that the missionary end of the activity should be responsible for some of the necessaries. If the Harbords are to look after the teaching work only, then more complete furnishings will be granted.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRt.

I am writing Harbord by this mail concerning your suggestion.\n\nAs the Rev. C.H. Fryer remains at Fort Alexander in charge of the Mission and we will have to find him the amount formerly received by him for school work, the Harbords will only have the school to look after. Whatever furnishings you provide under these conditions for the school residence I trust you will provide for, and arrange therefor with your Indian Agent or other suitable person.\n\nI understand from Mr. Harbord that he expects to give a month's notice in resigning his present school.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nMost faithfully yours,\n\nA.D.

As stated Mrs. Harbord is willing to accept the position of teacher though she would like to know why you preferred that she should undertake the work rather than her husband. She came here to interview me and I stated that the reason was probably that she possessed teacher's certificate. She would have preferred that her husband should have had the appointment with her assistance whenever it might be necessary. As a certificated teacher would she not be entitled to a larger salary than $75 per teaching month. She is prepared to take up the work as soon as the Archbishop releases them from the North Peguis School. I advised Mrs. Harbord to consult him at once. I was rather impressed by Mrs. Harbord's brightness and I hope that under her teaching the work at the Fort Alexander school will make good progress.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nMost faithfully yours,\n\nA.D.

Harbord's acceptance of the Fort Alexander Indian Day School. Mrs. Harbord possesses a teacher's certificate, and further, I have been given to understand that her husband is not physically fit for onerous duties at the present time. This is why the appointment was offered to Mrs. Harbord.

I met Mr. J. E. Dunlop, Provincial School Inspector, who was well satisfied with the progress and attendance at the Day school, and gave the teacher, Mrs. Harbord great praise for the work she is doing there.

Also the tidy and clean way the children are dressed.\n\nLast year the pupils grew enough vegetables in the school garden to supply them with hot vegetable broth once a week during the cold months. All this was done under the supervision of Mrs. Harbord.\n\nI would recommend that her salary of $35.00 per teaching month be increased to $100.00 as I consider that the amount of work she does and the interest she takes in it would be well earned.\n\nIn the Estimates for 1930-31 I am including an amount of $3000.00 for a new Day School at that point, as the present building is over 30 years old and is too small for the present attendance, besides being very cold in the winter months.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hunter, who holds a Manitoba second class permanent professional certificate, and has had fifteen years experience in rural schools. She is highly recommended by Dr. Robert Fletcher, former Deputy Minister of Education from whom I have a letter. Mrs. Hunter is prepared to accept the position, and I would hereby nominate her, and request your approval. Kindly advise as soon as possible.\n\nWith reference to Mr. George Slater. Last week I received a letter from our missionary under whom he works, advising that Mr. Slater had received a letter virtually dismissing him from the school at Little Black River. I should be obliged if you could let me know if this is correct. It is almost impossible to secure male teachers, and it is doubtful if a woman teacher could be appointed to Little Black River, which is isolated and scarcely suitable for a woman alone.

In view of the\nmany demands on the time of Departmental\nofficials it is regrettable that Indian Agents\ncannot settle such small matters as this without\nmaking it necessary for the teacher to communicate\nwith this office.

As Mrs. Clime is a very conscientious and just person and wishes to be quite regular and formal in every way, I suggest that you direct some member of your staff who is familiar with the 4th dimension regulations to advise this lady what she has to do, and what she has not to do in connection with her income tax returns.\n\nShe is not liable for payment of income tax actually, as she has three members of her family to support, and her salary is the average school teachers salary prevailing in Manitoba.\n\nI take this opportunity of greeting you once more, and I have often wondered how you are getting along down in the Capital. You never seem to have time to drop a line to an old friend, possibly this will bring at least a formal acknowledgment.\n\nAnyway Bob, try and set Mrs. Clime's mind at rest with respect to her problem.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.

McPherson, Indian Agent, Selkirk, Man.\n\nI attach letter which has just been received from the teacher of the Fort Alexander Day School. Please let me have a recommendation from you regarding the teacher's request to change the opening and closing hours at this school. The Department dislikes making exceptions of this nature, as other schools generally look for the same privilege. Have you had an opportunity of visiting this school since Mrs. Cline took charge? It would appear from her letter that she is not very much interested in her work. When replying the attached letter should be returned.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of Nov 29/43 re the Fort Alexander Day School. If it is the wish of the Dept change the hours at this school please advise me and I will notify the Teacher at once.\n\nI have visited this school since Mrs Cline has taken charge and from conversation with her I do not think her capable of handling the Indian children. I have one case where Mrs Cline sent one of the boys home and on investigation I do not blame her so I had the R.C.M.P visit this boy and his parents. The parents now wish the boy back at school but I understand the teacher will not have him. Please advise me as to the Department's wishes as I consider that the talking to by the police will have done this boy some good. I receive an average of two letters a week from Mrs Cline and I received one today stating that one of the boys tried to stage a \"Walk out strike\" as she puts it and I understand this boy is still absent. Such instances would give one the opinion that Mrs Cline can not handle the children. I know it is difficult to get teachers but the attendance is very poor at this school and from talking with the parents I gather that there is some misunderstanding between the Teacher and pupils. I would point out that I consider Mrs Cline would be a good teacher in a white school but just doesn't seem to have the right way of handling the Indians.\n\nReference to the wood for the Teacher's residence, we have never supplied wood and had it cut before for the Teacher's. Since Mrs Cline has asked for it the Teacher at Black River is also asking for it so if it is started all the schools in the Agency will want the same. As it has never been done before I do not consider we should start.\n\nE.

I am inclined to feel that it would be preferable to place a male teacher at this school, if at all possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.

She submitted good references when making application for the school, but these were all in connection with her work in rural and small town schools. I am sorry she does not seem to be making progress at Fort Alexander. There is no doubt it would be better to have a male teacher at that school, but such are, under present conditions, difficult to procure, and indeed it is not easy to procure women teachers.\n\nI shall keep the matter in mind and endeavour to find a more suitable teacher for next year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have decided to resign from my school here and if the position is not filled I would prefer to go to Fort Alexander Reserve, Pine Falls Manitoba for term commencing Sept. 1944.\n\nI have written Bishop Luthouse Kenora and you shall likely hear from him if the position is still vacant at Fort Alexander.\n\nI have quite a good attendance generally, a few sick at present but on the whole it has been fairly good. Mr. McBracken Injun Agent who helped alot to get them to attend more regularly feel sorry to leave in many ways.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6234, file 512-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI have received a letter from Mrs Cline asking if the Fort Alexander Day School would open again after summer vacation. She states that her attendance has been very low. I have made enquiries on the reserve re the attendance and the Indians all state they do not like the Teacher. I have threatened to prosecute the parents if the children do not attend school but do not think we should do so at this time as we would have many families to look after.\n\nMrs Cline may be a good teacher but my opinion from the first has been that she could not handle Indian children. The attendance at this school has been unusual as Fort Alexander was always one of our best schools.\n\nI would state here that Miss Simpson at Brokenhead and Miss Reid at Berens River have both shown excellent results during the last year. In my opinion unless some change is made it is not worth while carrying on at this school unless some improvement is made.\n\nWill you please advise me what should be done at this school.\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nApril 28, 1944.\n\nMr. E. McPherson, Indian Agent, Selkirk, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, with reference to Mrs. Cline, teacher of the Fort Alexander Day School. In view of your report the Department is notifying Right Reverend J. Lofthouse, D.D., Bishop of Keewatin, that we intend to dispense with Mrs. Cline's services at the end of June.

Hoey,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYesterday I received an intimation of the effect that a change of teachers is to be made at Fort Alexander Day School. Is this official? If so, it was a surprise to me, consequently I have not made any attempt to locate such other employment.\n\nWith your permission I would like to make one request\u2014that I may occupy the cottage during the month of July. I have a fairly large vegetable garden in which I need to be used this summer for my three children (all under age) and myself. We haven't a home and I shall not have an opportunity to look for a dwelling until July first. I have a piano and...\ntheir household goods to prepare for moving. This cannot be done while the children are at school and I am working.\n\nI would appreciate very gratefully your consideration in this matter.\n\nIn closing I might add that I have tried to do my work well and conscientiously. At times I have acted upon advice that was, after a year in Indian work, I doubt whether it was sound.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6234, file 512-1, part 2)\nOttawa,\nMay 23, 1944.\n\nMr. E. McPherson, Indian Agent, Selkirk, Man.\n\nI am sending forward herewith copy of a letter received by this Branch from Gladys A. Cline, teacher of the Fort Alexander Indian Day School.\n\nYou should inform this teacher that it is the intention of the Department to dispense with her services at the end of the present academic year (June 30). She will be succeeded by Miss Ida G. Fairservice. If it is Mrs. Cline's intention to remain in the cottage for the month of July, she should communicate with Miss Fairservice in respect to this matter. Miss Fairservice is at present teaching at the Kettle Point Indian Day School, R.R. No. 2, Forest, Ontario. Any arrangement reached between these two teachers with respect to the use of the cottage for the month of July will be acceptable to the Department.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nIn reply to your letter of June 22/44 I would state that last year was a very poor one at the Fort Alexander Day School owing to the teacher not understanding Indian children. However with a new teacher taking charge on Sept 1st I am sure there will be an improvement.\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent\nMr. P.A. Key,\nChief of Welfare Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI would be pleased to purchase for $2 or $3.50 a much used mattress in the cottage here. It is cotton filled and the cover is broken to the length of 2 feet in one place. It was not in good condition when I came, but has served.\n\nAssuming as it will probably be discarded this year, I could make use of it. I did not requisition for a new one as I had made a year's run in its present condition.\n\nMiss Fairweather wrote me that she will not require the cottage for July, and will not be coming to Pine Tree until school re-opens. Whether I do, I have not received the quarterly rent fee, nor the refund on income tax paid at Easter... Off.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6234, file 512-1, part 2)\nOttawa,\nJuly 17, 1944.\n\nMr. R. McPherson, Indian Agent, Selkirk, Man.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Mrs. Gladys Cline in which she states that she wishes to purchase a much-used, 6' mattress in the teacher's residence. She states that she is willing to pay $2 or $2.50 for it. It is impossible for us to decide whether or not this mattress should be sold. If it is in a usable condition I cannot see any necessity for selling it, because we would simply have to replace it. If, however, it will have to be replaced when the new teacher arrives, possibly it would be advisable to sell the old mattress to Mrs. Cline. I should appreciate hearing from you in the matter.\n\nIt is evident from Mrs. Cline's letter that she intends to remain in the teacher's residence for some time, due to the fact that Miss Fairbairn has advised her that she will not come to Fort Alexander until September 1. In this connection I would refer you to my letter of May 23.\n\nMrs. Cline also refers in her letter to a $5 refund on income tax. Evidently she filed an income tax return at Winnipeg. If there is any refund coming to her it will be paid by the Income Tax Branch and not by this Branch.\n\nR.A.

We need two schools as the present one is very old and should be discarded.\n\nAt Black River the log school is very old and past repairing. A new classroom should be provided. The present teacher, who at one time was in Treaty, has his own house. If Mr. Slater were to discontinue his work we would also need a teacher's residence.\n\nAt Brokenhead Reserve we have a good school but are in need of a house. The present teacher boarded at the mission, but this is closed. She was fortunate in securing accommodation with the people who purchased the old Hudson's Bay Post.\n\nMr. McPherson states two new schools should be built at Little Grand Rapids. The present buildings are really past repairing.\n\nI will advise you from time to time of other school buildings that may possibly be required.\n\nA.G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of June 19th re the attendance at the Fort Alexander Day School and wish to state that this attendance has not been satisfactory to me for the last two years. I have spoken to the parents on several occasions and the children would then attend for a time but would stop again. It makes the work very difficult for the teacher when the attendance is so irregular. I have informed the parents as to the regulations governing the family allowance.\n\nThe Indians on this reserve seem to be very suspicious of the allowance and are not registering. So far I have only received twenty-two registrations.\n\nSome years ago I took up the matter with the Department of a employeeing a man to bring the children on the east side across the river to school as the crossing is not safe for school aged children. I would suggest the after the war that a school be built on that side of the river as there are approximately twenty-five children who should attend school there. The class standing of the pupils I think is due to poor attendance as Miss Fairservice, in my opinion is a very good teacher. I think that when the family allowance cheques come for some the others will register and the attendance should increase. A large percentage of the children on this reserve are in the residential school but when the attendance increases after the family allowance is in force the present school accommodation will not be sufficient.\n\nI think that next term charges will have to be brought against some of the parents for the non-attendance of the children.\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge yours of the 12th ult., with reference to the resignation of Miss Ida G. Fairservice as teacher of the Fort Alexander Indian Day School. We are sorry to lose her services as she was doing good work in the school.\n\nI have recently received notice of the resignation of the Rev. Chas. R. Harbord from the Mission of St. Mark's Jack River, Norway House to take effect at the end of September. Mrs. Harbord has been the teacher at the Combined Provincial and Indian Day School, in which position she has done excellent work, but is unable to continue.\n\nAdvertisements for teachers are being made through the Winnipeg Free Press and in the Miner & News of Kenora in an effort to secure teachers for these two schools. We trust we may receive applications, and if and when such come to hand we shall hope to make nominations.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) J. Keewatin.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe: Fort Alexander & Jack River Schools.\n\nIn response to our efforts I have received an application for the position of teacher at Fort Alexander Indian Day School from Mrs. Elizabeth M. Bennett of Winnipeg. Mrs. Bennett holds a First Class Certificate, and has fifteen years experience, she being forty-five years of age. She gives the name of Inspector C. J. Muller as reference. As the teacher of this school must reside in the teacherage on the reserve it is desirable that she be a middle aged person of experience, and I hereby beg to nominate Mrs. Bennett as teacher for this school.\n\nIn further response to our advertising we received an application from Mr. J. P. Mullan of Winnipeg for the position of teacher at the Jack River Combined School. Mr. Mullan has had experience as a teacher of rural schools in Saskatchewan, but he has no certificate. He is fifty years of age, and on your approval he has expressed a willingness to take the position as teacher at this school. As the Rev. Chas. R. Harbord has resigned the mission, largely because Mrs. Harbord could no longer continue to teach the school, I arranged an interview with Mr. Mullan and asked if he would be prepared to act as missionary-teacher. He appeared to be willing to do this, but later wrote expressing some doubt as to his qualifications for the work of a missionary.\n\nIf Mr. Mullan is prepared to go to Jack River, would you approve of him as teacher of the Combined School? The grant for this school from your Department is very small, and together with the usual grant from the Department of Education of Manitoba totals only some $500.00, your former grant being I believe $200.00 and that of Manitoba $320.00, the total amount thus available being quite insufficient to provide for a teacher at a point some 300 miles north of Winnipeg.\n\nI should be obliged if you could wire me re the two above.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

M. Bennett and Mr. J. P. Mullan as teachers. In place of the former, Mrs. J. P. Taylor is now in residence at Fort Alexander Indian Day School and has I understand opened the school for teaching as from the 6th inst.\n\nI am sorry to have to inform you that for family reasons, Mr. J. P. Mullan withdrew from the appointment as Missionary-Teacher at Jack River, Norway House. He was to have gone from Winnipeg last week, and I was disappointed to learn by a letter written on the 1st inst., that he could not undertake the work. An effort was made to secure another man who is interested, but after consideration he also decided for family reasons that he could not accept the position.\n\nOur major difficulties at the Jack River School are that there is no teacherage, hence if the mission is vacant, as it is at present, there is no accommodation for a teacher, and even if we have a missionary in residence it may not be convenient to provide board and room for a teacher. Under present conditions we could not send in a lady teacher. The second difficulty is the smallness of the grant for a teacher which makes it necessary for the Church to provide the major portion of a teacher's salary, even though it is at present a Combined School with an available grant of $320.00 per year from Manitoba Department of Education. If the school is to be continued it would appear that the Indian Affairs Branch should restore at least the former grant of pre-war days.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The grades range from 1 to 4. Mrs. Anderson is an experienced teacher and the children should make fair progress.\n\nThe school building is in good condition, although some painting will be required next year.\n\nThe teacher's residence was decorated inside last year and is in fair condition. The shingles are in poor condition and the roof should be reshingled and painted next year.\n\nThe yards were tidy and the fences in fair condition.\n\nThe attendance should be better, but many children live across the river and the parents will not permit them to cross alone. The river is quite wide and the current swift. A day school across the river would solve the problem, as far as the children are concerned; but I know it would be difficult to secure a teacher because of the isolation.\n\n[Signature]\nM.G.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge cheques No. 5660 and 5661 being December quarter salary for teachers at Fort Alexander and Hollow Water River.\n\nI have noticed of late that cheques for the quarter have been $45.00 in excess of the amount formerly sent for this purpose and the September cheque has been $15.00 more than former cheques for that period.\n\nI learn indirectly that the former bonus has now definitely been added to the salary, which would account for the increased amount received by me. Would you kindly let me know if this is so. I should be obliged if you would also state the amount of the salary of the teachers at Fort Alexander, Hollow Water River, Jack River and Black River. This latter is, I understand, paid direct. I simply desire to have this information on file as from you.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary-Treasurer.\nOttawa, February 5, 1926.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd instant, I beg to say that previous to March 31, 1925, teachers at Indian day schools were allowed bonus at the rate of $15 a teaching month in addition to their regular salary. Payment of this bonus was discontinued from April 1, 1925, and the salary of each teacher was increased by $150 for the ten teaching months.\n\nFrom April 1st last salaries at the following rate have been paid to the teachers of the schools you mention in your letter -\n\nFort Alexander.............. $750\nHollowwater River........... 750\nJack River.................. 650\nBlack River.................. 650\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

You may inform her, however, that they may divide the classroom duties between them whenever it is considered advisable so to do, provided the progress of the pupils meets with no interference.\n\nAs other arrangements have been made for the missionary activity on the reserve, the Department will allow Mrs. Harbord a salary of $85 per teaching month.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Please give me at your earliest convenience a report in this connection and a recommendation. His Lordship suggests that a different site be chosen when a new building is erected. You might also comment on the best location for the day school to serve the children of Protestant parents on this reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. O. Latulippe, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter No.125-19-5 of April 11th, I beg to say that 13 lengths of stove and 3 elbows were delivered to the Fort Alexander Indian Day School.\n\nI consider that 6 new double desks for the smaller pupils are needed and I would recommend that they be supplied. The desks in this school are Globe style.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter No.125-195 of July 13th last, I beg to report that the building at the Fort Alexander Indian Day School is in fair condition, and the location is about central for the children attending. It is a frame building and is situated about two miles East from the Anglican Mission. The teacher, Rev. C.H. Fryer, desires to have the school closer to the Mission and it would be more convenient. Due to the proposed erection of a Pulp Mill on the same side of the school, I consider that it would be advisable to have the school two miles further away.\n\nThe cost of moving this building would be approximately $200.00 and the proper time to do this work would be during the winter months.\n\nI am informed that the Church authorities would grant a school site on their Mission land.\n\nHoping that this report will be satisfactory.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, October 14, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of 9th instant relative to the moving of the school building at the Fort Alexander Indian Day School to a new site on the Church of England Mission property. In this connection it is noted that the building is in fair condition and that it is central for the children attending but that due to the proposed erection of a pulp mill near the school it is considered advisable to have it moved to another site. We note that the cost of moving this building would be approximately $200.00 and that the proper time to do the work would be during the winter months.\n\nYou should again bring this matter to the attention of the Department when considered timely for the moving of the building and you should state whether a site could not be secured nearer the Mission property. This Department will hesitate to place the building on a site which it does not own.\n\nWith reference to six (6) new double desks required for the use of the smaller pupils, I beg to say that as the type of desks at present in use are those manufactured by the Globe Furniture Co., it would be necessary in ordering new desks that they be of the same type. You should obtain prices from the Western Seating Co., 179, Baunatyne Ave., Winnipeg, who are the western representatives of this firm for the supplying of the six new double desks of the size required. You should ask them to quote P. O. B. nearest railway station to the school. When you have this information you can place\n\nH. J.

You may also arrange for the purchase of the guy wire, pulleys, rope, etc., required.\n\nAfter this work is completed, you should forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.

This house is of log construction, about 18 x 24. The floors have not been well laid and the nails, instead of being driven through the tongue of the flooring, are simply driven straight down through the floor and consequently all the nail heads show. Finishing nails were not used so that these nail heads are quite noticeable. The house consists of one room downstairs and one up.\n\nThe school building is in need of paint. The inside porch needs repair as the plaster has fallen off in patches. Beaver board would perhaps give the best service in this entrance. The classroom is quite large, but was badly in need of cleaning. The blackboard is little better than paper and only about 10 ft. long. A new blackboard, 18 ft. long, would be of great assistance to the teacher.\n\nThe Indians\nRegina, Sask., Dec. 12th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report from Mr. Inspector Hamilton on the various schools in the Clandeboye Agency.\n\nI would draw your attention to what the Inspector says regarding the Day School on the Fort Alexander reserve. It is hoped that under the management of the new teacher, Mrs. Harbord, a change will be effected. There is an item of $1000.00 in the Estimates for repairs to Agency Day schools and no doubt some of this money will be expended on the Fort Alexander School.\n\nYou will note that the Inspector speaks well of the Fort Alexander Boarding school and I would draw your attention to his remarks regarding the fire-fighting equipment here. I would also draw your attention to what is said regarding the barn. Was this barn not built within the last few years?\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Hamilton, in a report on his recent inspection of the Fort Alexander Upper Indian Day School, states that the inside porch of the school building requires repairs, as the plaster has fallen off in places. He suggests that beaver board be used. He also states that the classroom is badly in need of cleaning, also that new blackboard is required.\n\nI have to request that you will have any repairs required made to the porch. It might be advisable to have the walls covered with beaver board, but no unnecessary expense should be incurred. It might be possible to have this work carried out during the coming Christmas holidays. Please also arrange to have the classroom thoroughly cleaned and placed in a good condition. When this work has been completed, you should forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nPlease inform the Department as to what blackboard is required, giving the length and width of same, and whether chalk trough and moulding are required. Full shipping directions for forwarding same should be given.\n\nThe Inspector has drawn attention to the floors in the new residence for the teacher. He states that they have not been well laid, and that the nails, instead of being driven through the tongue of the flooring, are simply driven straight down through the floor, and consequently all the nail heads show. Finishing nails were not used, so that these nail heads are quite noticeable.

I regret that it is too late to have these repairs done during the Xmas holidays, but will have this done during Easter and will have the material on the ground in good time.\n\nI visited the school on 20th instant, and found a marked improvement under the new teacher, Mrs. Harbord. There are at present 26 pupils on the roll, with an average attendance of 16. The blackboard material can be secured any time and put up. I expect to visit the reserve on 9th January and will take the correct measurements.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Harbord, the teachers, are very much disappointed in the school residence. It is built of logs and hard to heat and keep warm. The residence at North Peguis, where they taught before, was a frame building and very comfortable and, naturally, they feel up against it in a log building. This building was built on the specifications and under the supervision of Mr. Fryer, the late teacher and Anglican clergyman. The department supplied the lumber and the Indians did the work, rations being given them while at work. I cannot say that it is a first class job and quite agree with Inspector Hamilton's report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nIndian Affairs.

The enclosure with your letter certainly suggests that a new teacher's residence is required there. I may say that the present log structure was erected by the Indians, the Department allowing $125 for finishing material and rations for those that were working.\n\nIt is possible that funds can be found for building activity at this point during the coming fiscal year, and I should like a report from you as to the advisability of providing a combined classroom and teacher's residence on a new site. For some time, there has been an agitation to move the school to another part of the reserve.

In explanation, I beg to refer you to my letter of 10th April last and your reply, No. 125-19-5, of 18th April, informing me that the annual supply of biscuits were being forwarded from Regina. On receiving this shipment, I forwarded 200 lbs to Fort Alexander to tide them over for the term ending 31st June. On August 28th, I sent another 400 lbs, which was 150 lbs more than the estimates for the Fort Alexander Day school called for. I found that I could take this amount from Black River Day School, as they had a surplus over from the previous year.\n\nThe attendance at Fort Alexander School has more than doubled in the past year, and the teacher is doing splendid work and giving great satisfaction. The day I visited the school 27 children were present, with over 30 on the roll. The attendance of the younger children will probably decrease during the cold weather, but the average attendance should be at least 20, which would mean in biscuits ration 100 lbs per month, or 600 lbs more until the end of the term.\n\nIn the Estimates for 1929-30 the supply for Fort Alexander was estimated at 900 lbs, (exactly double the amount from the previous year) but even this, with the present attendance will not be sufficient.\n\nI would strongly recommend that the extra 900 lbs. be granted and trust you will approve of the expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The school grounds was very dirty due to the animals running loose. I would recommend that a fence be built round the school grounds, and the Chief, Joseph Kent, agreed to have a \"bee\" and erect this fence gratis, provided the Department would supply rations to the men while at work.\n\nIt will cost approximately $50.00 for material to fence in two acres with woven wire.\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| 30 rods. woven wire   | $30.00 |\n| 1-12 foot gate        | 7.35   |\n| Staples               | 7.75   |\n| Freight from Wpg.     | 6.00   |\n| Cartage from Pine Falls | 2.00  |\n| **Total**             | **$45.10** |\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, April 25, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, in which you recommend that a fence be built around the school grounds at the Fort Alexander Indian Day School, and giving an estimate of the cost of the material.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase of the quantity of woven wire, staples and a gate, and for the freight and cartage on same. It is noted that the Indians will erect this fence providing the Department will supply rations to them while at work. The Department will approve of your furnishing a reasonable quantity of supplies to the men who erect the fence, but no unnecessary expense for this purpose should be incurred. The labour is to be performed without cost to the Department other than the supplies authorized.\n\nWhen this work has been completed, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the fencing material and for the supplies issued to the men when building the fence, as well as receipts covering the freight and cartage charges on the material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Brandon,\nDept. Nurse.\nSelkirk, Man., 28th January, 1930\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter, No. 125-19-4, of the 8th instant, referring to requisition for teacher's desk, chair and cupboard for the Fort Alexander Indian Day School, I beg to advise you that on my recent visit to that Reserve, I inspected the school and found that the teacher uses an ordinary kitchen table and chair and that there has never been anything else supplied.\n\nI would recommend that the following furniture be purchased; from Christie School Supply Co., Brandon, Man.\n\n1 - Teacher's Arm Chair, No. 13  $11.50\n1 - Desk, No. 25  $26.00\n\nMr. J. Harberd, teacher, will make the cupboard if the Department will supply the material, 75 ft. V. ceiling and 48 lin. ft. lx2 at an approximate cost of $5.00. There is no cupboard in the school.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 1st, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, relative to the request of the teacher of the Fort Alexander Indian Day School to be supplied with a teacher's desk, chair and cupboard.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that our funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are extremely limited, and it will not be possible to provide the cost of supplying the above equipment at the present time. You may, however, arrange after April 1st next, to purchase from the Christie School Supply Company, Brandon, Man., 1 teacher's arm chair, No. 15, and 1 teacher's desk, No. 25. You may also arrange to supply the material required for the building of a cupboard. It is noted that the teacher will make the cupboard and that the cost of the lumber required will be approximately $5.\n\nAfter the purchase of the above equipment has been made, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost, and these should not reach the department until after the above date, when our funds for the next fiscal year will be available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Ass't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. McPherson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSir:\n\nMy attention has just been drawn by Mr. E. McPherson, Indian Agent at Selkirk, to the condition of the Day School building at the Fort Alexander reserve. This appears to have been built in 1892, and therefore is very old and the Agent points out that it is extremely cold and draughty and impossible to properly heat in severe winter weather. In the Estimates for 1927-28 provision was made for an expenditure of $2,500.00, but no action was taken to erect new school premises.\n\nBefore replying to the Agent, I shall be glad to know if it will be possible this year to incorporate in the Estimates, although nothing was asked, a sufficient amount to provide a new building this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 25, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 202-11A Gen. of the 19th instant, with reference to a new classroom at the Fort Alexander Indian Day School. I regret that there are no funds for this purpose, and the building will have to be postponed until 1931 when funds can be provided for the purpose. May I state that on January 23rd, 1928, the Department wrote asking for a recommendation concerning the advisability of providing a combined classroom and teacher's residence at this school. I am unable to find any reply. The Department, therefore, believed that our equipment there was suitable, as the teacher's residence was erected that year. I am unable to find any reference to the need of a new classroom in your estimates for the current year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nV. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

A new teacher's residence was erected on that reserve in 1928 after consultation with the Deputy Superintendent General when he visited Regina, but I find that I did not write to the Department after the discussion with him on the subject.

The same thing applies in the winter time; small children have to be driven to school, and very often it is impossible for the parents to do this. One of the old Indians, for the past few years, has been bringing the children across in the summer time in his boat, without receiving any remuneration whatever, but he is now too old to do this. The cost of this would be much less than operating a day school on each side of the river, and I am sure it would be much more satisfactory. It would also eliminate the chance of a serious accident happening in cases where several children have been in the habit of coming across the river in a boat by themselves.\nFORT ALEXANDER DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nAt the time of my visit there were 50 children on the roll, and an average attendance for the year of about 20.\n\nThe school itself is in a very dilapidated condition; it is 39 years since it was built, and it is in such a state that it is impossible to repair it without spending more money than the building is worth. A new school was asked for, and I wish to point out that this is one of the places where a new building is certainly required.\n\nThere is also another matter which I would like to place before the Department, viz; the Protestant Indians are asking that another day school be built across the river, where, with the children now coming of school age, I believe there would be in the neighbourhood of 20 children coming from there. I understand this has already been brought to the attention of the Department.\n\nI am of the opinion that the most economical and satisfactory way of meeting this situation would be to build a new school on the site of the old school, which I have already mentioned is urgently required, and where there is a new teacher's residence, and that the Department make arrangements for some reliable Indian to bring all the children across the river in a boat in the summer time, and by sleigh in the winter. The river is at least half a mile wide at this point, and it is dangerous to allow the children to come alone. It is also a difficult matter for the parents to spare time to bring their children across every morning as they have to work hard for a living, and therefore, very often the children do not...\nFORT ALEXANDER DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school is operated under the auspices of the Anglican church, and is in charge of Mrs. Charles Harbord. I have never inspected this school before, but I am very well acquainted with Mrs. Harbord's work as she taught for some time on the Peguis Reserve, in the Fisher River Agency, and she has always given satisfaction. Mr. & Mrs. Harbord are doing splendid work at Fort Alexander.\n\nAt the time.\nRegina, Sask., July 2nd, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose a report by Inspector M. Christenson of his visits to schools in the Clandeboye Agency.\n\nFORT ALEXANDER DAY SCHOOL\n\nIn regard to the day school at Fort Alexander emphasis is laid on the desirability of erecting a new school. There was an item of $3,000.00 in the Estimates to provide for this, but I have not heard from the Department as to whether this can be allowed or not. The Inspector refers to the request of the Indians for another day school across the river. He is of the opinion, however, that the solution of the problem would be to erect a new school on the site of the present one and provide means for the transportation of the children across the river by boat in the summer and by sleigh in the winter. I have not had an opportunity of discussing with Mr. Christianson and I am not prepared at the present moment to make a recommendation.\n\nW. M.

The plaster of the ceiling is coming down in heaps, every rainstorm makes it worse as the roof is open.\n\nI think you have realized the condition of the walls; the rotten state of the woodwork makes it so draughty.\nthat last winter I received several letters from parents requesting me not to let their children sit near the wall as they got so cold. I quite saw their point; it was perfectly true, but when I changed their places, as we had to keep a big fire to make the school possible at all\u2014their faces were scorched.\n\nOf course I quite see that repairing a building as dilapidated as old is this\u2014it is 39 years old\u2014is a waste of money, even if it is possible. I simply wish to ask if I have your authority to close the school in severe weather if I consider it advisable.\n\nYours truly,\nM. C. Hartford\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose letter from Mrs. O. Harbord Teacher at Fort Alexander Indian Day School, which is self-explanatory.\n\nThis building is in very poor condition, and being so old\u201439 years\u2014is too far gone to be properly repaired.\n\nAn item of $3000.00 has been included in the Estimates for the last three years for a new school and on 15th July a letter was received from the Commissioner Mr. W.M. Graham, Regina, advising that no funds were available to carry out this work during the present fiscal year.\n\nI have no record of having received a requisition from Mrs. Harbord for a stove, although I remember her mentioning it.\n\nWill the Department authorize the purchasing of a stove and 15 stove pipes and 2 elbows. Also repairing the plaster in the ceiling and three gals-grey paint for inside work.\n\nThe approximate cost of stove and pipes.\n\n| Item       | Cost |\n|------------|------|\n| 36 in stove | $21.50 |\n| or 48 in stove | $27.50 |\n| 18 ft in pipes | $3.60 |\n| 2 ft in elbows | $0.50 |\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE.

The condition of the present old school building is noted, and the providing of funds for the erection of a new building next year will receive consideration.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase and installation of a stove, with the necessary stove pipes and elbows. You should see that the stove obtained is of a size and type that would be satisfactory to heat the building. You should purchase the stove from indicated sources, after obtaining the lowest price. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, and after the stove and stove pipes have been obtained, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. It is hoped that when the new stove is supplied the teacher will be able to carry on the work during the coming winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nE.

This school is in charge of Mrs. Charles Harbord. Mrs. Harbord is an exceptionally good teacher, and has been in the employ of the Department for a number of years; she taught school on the Peguis Reserve before going to Fort Alexander. Mrs. Harbord is obtaining splendid results in the classroom. She is, however, working under a great handicap. As I pointed out in my report on this school last June, the school building is very old and dilapidated, and in cold weather the children cannot work here as the wind blows right through the walls. However, I realize that the Department have no funds at the present time, but I informed Mrs. Harbord that a new school would no doubt be erected as soon as funds could be provided. When a new school is built, I trust the Department will not lose sight of the suggestion made in my report dated June 24th last - that arrangements be made to convey the children from across the river to the school.\n\nM.

In winter it cannot be properly heated and the outside walls are patched up with old boards to keep the wind and snow out.\n\nWould you kindly let me know the decision of the Department as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE.

Would it not be possible, with a few minor repairs, to make the present building fairly comfortable for another year? You might examine the building and report as to the minor repairs that would be absolutely necessary, giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

It is impossible to give the exact amount in view of the fact that we have not a proper plan of the school required and in hiring day labour there is always a possibility of extra time, which is a difficult matter to control. This price covers material, the installation of a furnace, eavestroughing, and painting, thus giving the building complete in every respect, except for seats and other equipment.\n\nI would like to be advised at once if the erection of the school may be proceeded with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G.

There's enough children on this side of the river to have a school build. It's very awkward both summer and winter for children to get across the river so big for this place. There was a school on this side before. And we're putting them in your hands to help us out having a school on this side. When late Mr Harper came here he put a stop to this.\n\nNumber of children on this side of the river of school age from six years of age up to inside of fifteen years for scholarship.\nRobert Atkinson\nJohn Dorie Jr\nJohn Abraham Jr\nSidney Dorie Jr\nGeorge Abraham Jr\nJames Abraham Jr\nAndrew Abraham\nJoseph Johnson\nGeo James\n\nJosue Abraham\nMarcie Dorie\nAndrew Thickett\nJohn Abraham Sr\nAlexander Abraham\nThomas James Stone\nFort Alexander\nPine Falls P.O.\nMan. Jan 29 1961\n\nMr McPherson,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe enclosed petition has been handed to me to be sent on to you. It comes from the Indians on the east side of the river and it explains itself. The people have been for some time complaining about sending their children across, especially in the summer in a skiff and say that it is dangerous. I agree that it is dangerous for half a dozen child to be in a skiff crossing a river a mile wide. In the winter it can be bitterly cold as well.\n\nHowever I am doing what they have asked me to do i.e. sending this petition on to you and ask you to take it up.\n\nyours truly\n\nW. H. J. Walter\nSelkirk, Man., February 3, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have received a petition from the Indians residing on the East side of the River on the Fort Alexander Reserve, requesting a school on their side of the River. They have requested that we forward their petition to the Department. Some of the families who have signed this petition have no children at all and of the 21 children belonging to those signing the petition, several are not of school age.\n\nI would not recommend that a school be built at the present time but I would recommend that consideration be given to the hiring of an Indian to take these children back and forth across the River by boat as it is dangerous for children to be on the river alone in a boat. Possibly some arrangement could also be made for an Indian to take these children to school by team in the Winter time. If the Department will consider some arrangement as suggested here, I will try and arrange for a man to do this work.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 11, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant you may inform the Fort Alexander Indians that due to present conditions regarding which all are aware it will not be possible to consider the erection of another school on the East side of the river.\n\nIt appears from the first paragraph of your letter that the number of children of school age from the East side of the river who should be attending the Fort Alexander Day School is not very large. Our funds for transportation are quite limited but you might let me know what it would cost to hire an Indian to take the children across the river by boat during the summer months and also what it would cost to have them driven across the river during the winter. At the same time you should state the number of children for whom such provision would have to be made. When this information is received the matter will have further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F. McPherson,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nSelkirk, Man., October 18, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\u2014\n\nI wish to report that the well at the Fort Alexander Indian Day School is useless and something will have to be done to put it in working condition at once.\n\nI can get this well re-dug and new pipes installed for approximately $40.00.

However, as no water was reached in the old well, we tried two other places before we finally got a flow of water. This necessitated more labour but the old pipes are long enough to reach the water in the new well. I wish to inform you they are now getting sufficient water and the pump and well is satisfactory to the new teacher as I was on the reserve last week and inspected the well.\n\nIn view of the extra cost of Indian labour to bore the well, I would appreciate it if you would forward an accountable cheque for $39.00 instead of $30.00.

My last school was the senior school at Pine River, with Mr. J. E. B. Dunlop as principal trustee. Mr. Fletcher recommended me to Bishop Lipton, head of this school, and Mr. Adna Brown had been teaching in my school in Ottawa. They both advised me to try it for a year or two.\n\nI find the Indian children very musical, but there is no musical instrument except the school. Since the last teacher asked for a gramophone and records, could you help me in the matter of a gramophone and records? I consider it very much needed\u2014 I bought the rhythm sticks for a rhythm band myself from Ottawa. The children are playing by the tunes.\n\nIndian Affairs.

May I express the hope that you will find the work interesting and well worth while.\n\nThe records here indicate that it has not been the policy of the Department to purchase gramophones for Indian day schools anywhere in the Dominion, and of course in a period such as this all expenditures have been substantially reduced. I am anxious, however, to do everything possible to encourage you to help your pupils. Therefore, if you can secure from Eaton's or from any other source a gramophone with records at a cost not to exceed $50.00, you are authorized to make the purchase. The bill for this purchase should be sent forward to the Department in duplicate.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMrs. Marjorie B.

I am enclosing his answer. As he requested I sent in the triplicate requisition forms for supplies. It was not acknowledged.\n\nIn December I wrote him again in regard to materials for handwork. I also enclosed his reply. Whether he replied, the requisition or destroyed it I cannot say. However I sent triplicate requisitions again asking for a new register\u2014construction paper etc. That was not acknowledged either.\n\nI have had to buy all materials I have used for manual\u2014sewing and handwork. I am enclosing a list of some of these things as I feel the Department should pay for them.\n\nSince Christmas I have had 18 to 20 pupils each day. Mr. Walters says this is more children than have ever attended\u2014that\nis encouraging\u2014\n\nWould you see I had\na news register\u2014continued Dec. 28/42.\n\n2 packages of construction paper (assorted colors)\n2 packages of paper for paper folding & cutting\n200 sheets of drawing paper\n\nI will try to make this do till the\nend of June when I will be through here!\nI promised to give the Indian work a\nfair trial so am trying to stay here\nand do good work till Feb. end of June\n1943.\n\nAs my daughter is assistant minister\nat Young Church\u2014bringing the Y.P.M. News\nout and the toys and candy for the tree.\nI provided the decorations etc.\n\nThank you for the cod liver oil\u2014\ngiving each child a dessertspoonful at\nlunch each day\u2014It has caused an\nimprovement I think!\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMarjorie B. Hunter.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 28, 1943.\n\nDear Mrs. Hunter:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, I have reviewed our files and find that we received a requisition from you dated October 30, 1942. This arrived here on November 6 and the Stationery Office was requested to supply the following:\n\n- 2 Copies \"Junior Handicraft\"\n- 6 Boxes water colours\n- 1 Ream foolscap\n\nThere were other articles requested, such as poster paper, construction paper and plasticine, but we have not been supplying these due to difficulty in securing some of the articles and in the second place we have been trying to keep expenditure as low as possible.\n\nWe have also received a requisition from you dated December 6. This arrived here on December 21 and the Stationery Office was requested to supply 12 sets of number cards and strips, 12 sets of letter builders and 6 boxes water colours. A daily register was also ordered on this requisition and was sent to you on December 28.\n\nI note that the letters which Indian Agent McPherson sent to you were addressed to Fort Alexander, Man. On the two requisitions we received from you you stated that the post office address was Pine Falls, Man. Consequently the articles ordered from the Stationery Office and the school register which was sent from this office were addressed to you at Pine Falls, Man. It has occurred to me that possibly there is mail awaiting you at Pine Falls which, as stated above, was the post office address to which you stated the articles should be sent.\n\nMrs. Marjorie B. Hunter,\nTeacher, Fort Alexander Indian Day School,\nPine Falls, Man.\n\nP.S.G.\nWith reference to the attached account, the Department is prepared to arrange repayment to you, but before doing so, in view of present regulations, we will have to have the actual accounts from the firms from whom you purchased the articles and, of course, to allow payment to be made to you these accounts will have to be receipted. No doubt you have these and if you forward them I will arrange for a refund.\n\nWhile, as stated above, we have not been supplying construction paper and folding paper, it has been decided, in view of your special request, to order these and a requisition for same is being sent to the Stationery Office today. It will probably be some time before you receive them because, as you are aware, present conditions make it impossible for firms to assure prompt deliveries.\n\nI am writing to Mr. McPherson to see if anything could possibly be done to improve the water supply.\n\nI am returning the letters which you forwarded to me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 28, 1945.\n\nMr. R. McPherson, Indian Agent, Selkirk, Man.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mrs. Hunter, teacher of the Fort Alexander School, in which she states that there is very little water in the well. I understand that Mrs. Hunter is doing good work at Fort Alexander and I would like to have everything possible done to make living conditions as favourable as they can be made. It would, therefore, be appreciated if you would arrange for an immediate examination of the well with a view to taking any action possible to improve the water supply.\n\nR.A. Hoop,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. R. A. Hoey, Supt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReceived your letter today of January 22, 1943 regarding the well at the day school Fort Alexander Reserve. I am going to the Reserve tomorrow and will look into this matter at once. Last Fall I visited the school and found that the Indians living on the Reserve were using the water and I informed Mrs Hunter to stop them any time that the water was getting low till next spring this she did and on a later date she informed me that there was lots for her when the Indians did not use it, that is the last time I had any word about her being short of water, I do not think that I would be able to have it dug any now till spring, I will send you a report on my return.\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\nFort Alexander School,\nTime Falls P.O.,\nJanuary 25th '43.\n\nDear Mr. Holy:\n\nThank you for your letter and your kind co-operation.\n\nMr. M. Pearson was at the school today. He stated the well would be fixed and the wood supply brought to the school.\n\nI have kept a list of all supplies received by me since coming to the school. If you should like this list I'll be glad to forward a copy to you.\n\nMy mail is brought out by one of the Indians, Mr. Henderson every night. This\nman is a caretaker at the Indian Hospital and trustworthy in that.\n\nI did not receive the school register or any water colours.\n\nI am enclosing one bill I have from Moyes - the other things I bought at Edmonton and haven't the bill.\n\nI also am enclosing a receipted bill from the Mercantile Store - Pine Falls. I'll be glad of the repayment.\n\nMy postal address is Pine Falls - there is no postoffice at Fort Alexander.\n\nThanking you again for your assistance.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Teacher]\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\nPay to Mrs. Marjorie B.

I think it would be foolish to pay the Indians to dig another hole and put in more pipe. There should be a well drilled by a man who understands the work. The well here is just a 'surface' well. In the fall there were bugs and flies floating around in the water. One thing that is very necessary here is good water. As you know the river water is condemned\u2014it is filled with germs.\n\nIf a 'well driller' would reach good water it would mean a great deal not only to the school but to the district.\n\nThank you,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nM.B. Hunter\nR.A. Hoey: Sup't of Welfare and Training:\n\nRe: Pump at Fort Alexander School.\n\nI have just returned from a trip to Fort Alexander reserve and while there I inspected the school and interviewed Mrs. Hunter. I did not inform her that I had received a letter from you regarding the water but in our conversation I asked her if she was getting a good enough supply of water for her own use. She informed me that she was but that when she returned to school after the Christmas holidays, there was no water in the well. She knew that the Indians had been using the well while she was away and she informed them that they were not to do so. Since then she has had sufficient water.\n\nI feel satisfied that when spring comes, we should extend the pipe down another ten feet to assure a plentiful supply for her and the Indians living close to the school. I wish you would please give me permission to do this when the warm weather comes.\n\nE. McPherson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 6, 1943.\n\nDear Mrs. Hunter:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of January 31, in which you intimate that in your judgment a well driller should be employed to deepen the well at your school.\n\nYou will readily appreciate that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to undertake a project of this nature unless provision has been made for such work in the annual estimates. It so happens that no provision was made for the construction of a well at the Fort Alexander Day School, either in the estimates of this year or next year. I feel it is unnecessary to add that in view of the critical times in which we are living, it is exceedingly difficult, also, to secure funds for the regular services. However, I am communicating today with Indian Agent McPherson, in the hope that a small amount may be available from some source to deepen the well. I would imagine it would be almost impossible to proceed with the work until the weather moderates.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMrs. Marjorie B. Hunter,\nTeacher,\nFort Alexander Indian Day School,\nPine Falls, Manitoba.\nEX'D.\n\nA.\n\nOttawa, February 9, 1943.\n\nMr. E. McPherson, Indian Agent, Selkirk, Man.\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, in which you express the opinion that the pipe in the well at the Fort Alexander Day School should be extended for a distance of approximately 10 feet.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would make arrangements to undertake this work at the earliest possible date. It is of the utmost importance that there should be at this school an adequate supply of water for the teacher and for the pupils in attendance. I am not at all sure, however, that the Indians close to the school should be supplied from this source. This is a matter upon which it is difficult to express an opinion without being familiar with local conditions.\n\nR. A.

The erection of a fence along the top of the river bank to keep out the Indian cattle. I would suggest a four-strand barbed wire fence with plenty of good posts. It will require two spools of wire and perhaps thirty posts. Material approximately $14.00 and about $6.00 for labor.\n\n2. The teacher's residence needs interior decoration. The walls and ceilings are badly smoked and dirty. Mrs. Cline, the teacher, does not request expensive decoration but would like the walls repaired and tinted. It is hard to get men for such work but I believe Mr. Irvine might release a man if Mr. McPherson had the necessary authority. The floors also should be painted.\n\nI would recommend that the Agent be instructed to proceed with this work at once.\n\nNext year the school and residence should be painted outside. Unfortunately Mr. McPherson overlooked this in his estimates. If it is not too late I would suggest $350.00 be inserted to cover the material and work. The school was painted inside this summer and the work was well done. The room is now much brighter and will be more pleasant both for the teacher and pupils.\n\nA.G.

I had permission for the interior work last year but was unable to get anyone to do the work. Mr. Morris suggested that the exterior of both building should be done while the men are there.\n\nI would recommend that this work be done and would like an early reply so that the job may be completed before the teacher moves in for the opening of the school.\n\nE.

Two coats was insufficient to make an evenly finished surface.\n\nAs for the eavestrough on the East side of the house, after cleaning off the sealing paint with a wire brush, it developed leaks all through, so I thought it advisable to replace same.

Neary,\n\nReference your letter 512-5 (E1) dated June 30, 1949, re Fort Alexander Day School - on receipt of your letter I took the matter up with the Daoust Electric Company, the firm wiring the residence, and they advised me that they are going down to the school in a couple of days to do that job and would also wire the school - putting in four fluorescent lights, one plug and two ordinary lights in the halls for $150.00.\n\nI advised them to go ahead and do the work, as I am quite aware that I would be unable to get anyone else to do it for that price, as it would cost from $25.00 to $30.00 for transportation. I trust my action meets with your approval.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\nAIR MAIL\n\nJuly 20th, 1949.\n\nMr. R.S.

(RG 10, Volume 6234, file 512-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nMy dear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nRe Indian Day School at Fort Alexander.\n\nAs you are aware we are hoping to have a school teacher to take up the work in this school after the summer holidays in place of Rev. C. H. Fryer, who is unable to give the school the attention it requires. He will continue to look after the Missionary side of the work and with the work he is doing at Pine Falls he will have his time occupied.\n\nIn order to prepare for the change it is necessary to provide a residence for the teacher and the Indians are taking down a house formerly used as a residence belonging to the Mission and are removing the materials to the school site with the intention of re-erecting it for a teacher's residence. I have been asked to apply for materials for new flooring and roofing, windows and doors, nails, etc., and for rations for the Indians while working on the building. The rations are estimated at about $100. I am sending a list of materials required to the Indian Agent at Selkirk, together with measurements of the re-erected building, with the request that he will bring the matter before those to whom he is responsible.\n\nAs I have learned that both Commissioner Graham and the Deputy Supt are away and will likely be absent for some little time, I thought it best to write you so that the matter may go through the proper channel. I leave for the North shortly and would appreciate an early reply.\n\nMost truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6234, file 512-8, part 1)\nOttawa, June 6, 1927.\n\nDear Bishop Dewdney:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the provision of a residence for the new teacher at the Fort Alexander Indian Day School. Your Lordship may rest assured that, when the recommendation of the Indian Agent is to hand, with a list of the finishing materials required and the request for $100 for rations, it will receive very favourable consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell F.

Keewatin.\nSelkirk, Man. 15th June, 1927\n\nSir:\n\nI understand that the Right Rev. A.D. Dewdney, Bishop of Keewatin, has been in communication with the Department about building a residence for the teacher at Fort Alexander Indian Day School. There is a log house belonging to the Mission which has been pulled down and the logs and material which can be used again have been hauled over by the Indians to the new site. I beg to enclose a list of the material which will be required to finish the building, which has been sent to this office by the Bishop.\n\nI intend to visit the Fort Alexander Reserve about the 27th instant, and do not expect to be there again until the end of August, as I will be away on the Annuity trips. Kindly advise me as to your decision regarding this work, so that I will be in a position to take the matter up when I go there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nFort Alexander Day School,\nPine Falls, Man.\nJany. 12th. 1928\n\nO.A. Stevenson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent, Selkirk.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith regard to the teacher's residence at the Fort Alexander Day School, instead of being able to improve the house as we thought, we can do nothing and it gets continually worse.\n\nIt is extremely repugnant to me to complain as I appreciate your efforts to make the house habitable for us, but it seems impossible to effect any improvement.\n\nOwing no doubt to the time of year the mudding up was done, the frost and wind crack the mud which is constantly falling from between the logs both inside and out, creating terrible draughts, dangerous to a man suffering from bronchitis, as my husband does, due to overseas service.\n\nFor the same reason we cannot improve the barn-like interior or give it any appearance of comfort, as hammering a nail brings down a shower of mud and lime, the dust of which is very painful and injurious to affected bronchial tubes. After a fall of snow we have to shovel snow out of the house as the roof is open.\n\nApart from the acute discomfort, the fact that we live in a house, similar to, but not as good as some on this Reserve, and have to cook, eat and sleep in the one room, will lower our prestige with these people and ruin all hopes of successful work.\n\nWe are sure the Department wishes the school and its surroundings to do them credit, but one cannot do their best work living in such conditions.\n\nI should be obliged if you would bring my remarks to the notice of the Department without delay.\n\nThe matter of a proper water supply and of an outhouse, both of which are entirely lacking, can be taken up later.\n\nI am,\nYours truly,\n(signed) M.C. Harberd.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6234, file 512-8, part 1)\nSir:\n\nLast summer the Department built a log house on the Fort Alexander reserve for the accommodation of the teacher of the Day School, the matter having been taken up with the Department direct and authority given to have the work done. It would appear now that the house is not at all satisfactory, in fact is not fit for habitation, and there is no doubt in my mind that a decided mistake was made in plastering a house of this kind with mud, as was done. The day for this style of house is long gone by.\n\nI believe we could put up a very decent teacher's residence here for about $3800.00.\n\nCopy of a letter received by Indian Agent Stevenson from Mrs. Harbord, the wife of the teacher, is herewith enclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 23, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 202-11A of the 17th instant, with reference to the teacher's residence at the Fort Alexander Indian Day School. The enclosure with your letter certainly suggests that a new teacher's residence is required there. I may say that the present log structure was erected by the Indians, the Department allowing $125 for finishing material and rations for those that were working.\n\nIt is possible that funds can be found for building activity at this point during the coming fiscal year, and I should like a report from you as to the advisability of providing a combined classroom and teacher's residence on a new site. For some time, there has been an agitation to move the school to another part of the reserve. I should be grateful if you would investigate this question at an early date and let me have a recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6234, file 512-8, part 1)\nSIR:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant No. 125-19-8, with reference to the teacher's residence at the Fort Alexander Indian Day School.\n\nI shall make a report as to the advisability of providing a combined classroom and teacher's residence on a new site, but I would ask you to let this matter stand until the snow goes when I shall make the trip to that point myself and look into the matter thoroughly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. W. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. INSPECTOR DUNLOP,\ndated March 14th, 1928, on his inspection\nof the Fort Alexander Residential School\u2014\nUpper Indian Day School.\n\nOriginal on File 125-19-6.\n\nPlans are afoot, I am told, to build a\nnew house for the teacher and new toilets and repair\nthe school. This is certainly very desirable and\neven necessary. The outbuildings are not fit for\nuse. The school needs repairs and brightening up.\nAnd Mr. and Mrs. Harbord deserve a comfortable\nhouse.\nOttawa, July 6th, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nI would refer you to your letter of January 30th, last, your file No. 202-114 Oca., relative to the building of a teacher's residence at the Fort Alexander Indian Day School. An urgent request has been received from the teacher, Mr. Harford, that this residence be provided. We have no funds specially provided in this year's estimates, but the question of the erection of a building will receive consideration upon receipt of a report as to the advisability of providing a combined teacher's residence and classroom on a new site. You might also report as to the urgency of these requirements, and the cost involved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6234, file 512-8, part 1)\nSir:\n\nIn connection with the building of a teacher's residence for the teacher at the Indian day school at Fort Alexander, I would be pleased if the Department would supply me with an accountable cheque for $1000.00 to pay for labour, hauling, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.J. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFunds necessary for replacement of the teacher's residence at the Fort Alexander Indian Day School were not included in the Estimates for the current fiscal year. Mr. Commissioner Graham pointed out, in January, that the house was not fit for habitation, and he strongly urged that a building be provided. You allowed an appropriation for a new school building at Enderby, B.C., and, with the Fort Alexander need in mind, I did not send out any authority to Mr. Indian Agent Ball in May. During the summer, there has been no repetition of the request for this school, and I believe that its erection can be safely postponed.\n\nThis will release funds for the erection of the Fort Alexander teacher's residence, and, as we have a very satisfactory teacher there now, whose husband is a physically unfit returned soldier, I am quite eager to do something for them.\n\nMr. Commissioner Graham, in answer to a letter of July 6th asking for a report as to the advisability of going ahead this year, now replies with the request for an accountable cheque with which to pay labour. In view of the urgent need of this building, I wish to recommend that Mr. Graham be authorized to proceed with the work, on a day labour basis. The estimated cost is $3,800.\n\n[Signature]\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, September 1st, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your 203-11A of the 27th ultimo, applying for an accountable cheque for $1,000 to pay labour in connection with the new teacher's residence at the Fort Alexander Indian Day School. I wish to point out that there does not appear to be an answer to official letter of July 5th and that no authority was directed to you. However, in view of the urgency of this new building as indicated in your letter of January 17th last, the Deputy Superintendent General has authorized the work. You will please undertake this building on a day labour basis at an estimated cost of $3,000. In the purchase of materials and the engagement of labour, please be guided by Dr. Scott's 1-1-5 of May 28th last.\n\nUnder separate cover, the accountable cheque is being directed to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRegina, Sask.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources\nOTTAWA\n\nMr. McPherson reports that the teachers residence at the day School on the Fort Alexander Reserve has very little furniture other than a stove, bed and a couple of kitchen chairs. He suggests the purchase of a studio lounge, three chairs, a small table and a rug 8 x 10. They probably cost around $120.\n\nMrs. Fauservice is in charge at this school and already the attendance has much improved.\n\nA. G.

Neary,\n\nWith reference to your letter 512-8 (E.1) of May 12th, I have secured a price on wiring the residence of the Fort Alexander C.E. Indian Day School. I do not see that any purpose would be derived from wiring the school. Therefore, I did not request a price on this work.\n\nDacoust Electric Company, St. Boniface, will wire the residence, including material and labour, for $140.00. I have reduced the number of switches and requested cheaper fixtures. However, the reduction I have made would not come to more than $30.00; therefore, the price as forwarded by Mr. Olson and received from S.A. Johnson and Company, is way out of line. May I have authority to have this work done as the wires are already connected to the house and the Power Commission are anxious to get the service in.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nEncl.\n\nP.S. Since dictating this letter Mr. Olson has been in the office advising that the Inspector of Schools stated this school is too dark and needs more light. However, I would advise leaving this until I visit the school, and I think it could be remedied by putting in a couple of piano windows on the other side of the school.\nMay 31st, 1949.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th instant, the Department approves acceptance of the tender of Daoust Electric Company, St. Boniface, to wire the teacher's residence at the Fort Alexander C.E. Indian Day School for an amount of $140.00.\n\nIt is noted that this amount includes material and labour both. We agree with you that the wiring of the school should be delayed until you have an opportunity to visit the reserve.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\n| DATE     | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| July 30  | To amount of account, detailed copies attached, to wire Teacher's Residence, Fort Alexander Indian Day School. |        |\n|          |                                                                         | 140.00 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Any man might well be willing to take up a work so full of promise. Any officer of the Department would be glad to see a School erected but the time is not yet.

It was commenced some 8 years ago practically and it has not been maintained with any degree of efficiency and at the present it is an unoccupied field no one not even a school teacher being on the ground.\n\nThere is a Missionary's House very poor indeed and a church which is hardly worthy of the name. There are a few houses very few indeed in the vicinity of the Mission. The Indians are hunters for the most part and are only near in summer and in the great Holidays such as Christmas and New Year. They live for the most part in old fashioned wigwams and are camped in sequestered places all winter where the north winds are harping over the pines lyrics learned when the world was young.\n\nBesides the people have chosen their reserve a full days journey from the site of the Mission station and if their request carries it will be necessary to move all the Methodist people have at Gods Lake or forsake it and build anew.\n\nI could not therefore recommend that a School be built at Gods Lake at present. Better wait until it is known where the Band will be located and then build wisely and well.\n\nThe population of Gods Lake was found to be 294 or may 300. Of these 66 were boys and 91 were girls.

Perrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nThe Secretary Department of Indian Affairs Ottawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of Oct. 23-\n\nNo. 228485/1\n\nMr. Williams was sent in & came back in the summer with instructions to build a place of worship, and what would be suitable for school purposes for a time, and if he could gather together enough children to open up school. He is quite qualified for such a work from an educational point of view.\n\nThe General Board voted $600 for his support; this was in harmony with representations and requests from those who knew the facts. The department will help it along by sending the school supplies. A further effort will be made if the school is a success.\n\nIndian Affairs.

T. Perrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, in which he states that Mr. Wildgoose opened the school at this place with the consent of the authorities of the Methodist Church. If the attendance and general results warrant it the Department will be prepared to pay a salary of $300.00 per annum to Mr. Wildgoose upon the receipt of the proper returns. You will be good enough to advise him to this effect and give him the necessary instructions. He should submit reports at intervals for transmission to the Department.\n\nThe supplies which were asked for in the requisition above referred to will be ordered from the Government Stationery Office to be sent to you to be forwarded. A larger supply of scribblers and lead pencils will be sent instead of the slates and slate pencils.\n\nWith regard to the blackboard I have to ask you to state whether you have as yet received any trace of the supply that was sent you sometime ago. Until you do it is not considered advisable to send in a further supply, but the chalk and blackboard eraser will be sent and it may be that Mr. Wildgoose can make a board that will answer the purpose.\n\nYou\n\nG. G. Calverley, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Keewatin.\nYou may purchase the axe, broom, water pail, drinking cup and the other articles asked for and a register will be sent from the Department. Of course these purchases should not be made unless the school is in operation and the purchase is warranted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nExtracts from report submitted by J.G.

School is taught by Mr. Wildgoose who I believe is not a properly licensed teacher. I think that it would as well that a properly licensed teacher be appointed to this place and that a school house should be built on the Reserve, which would be better liked by the Indians.\n\nSgn.

They are in a state of transition from one camping ground to another or till they settle, it does not appear wise to erect a school building till the Indians are upon their reserve as chosen by them this summer.\n\nWhere there was 9 families last winter there will only be 2 families this winter.

D. McLean,\nActing Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter No.123-3-1 of Oct.9th last, just received, would say, that so far as I have been able to discover, there has not at any previous time been a Day School at God's Lake. I understood that Mr. Kell went there as Missionary, but he informed me that he intended to do some teaching if he could get pupils, and I furnished him with a few such articles as I had on hand, so that if he could get the children, he would have the material with which to work. I did not understand that it was a matter of opening a School, but a school is needed, if it is workable.\n\nI have written Mr. Kell, and forwarded to him Quarterly Return and Requisition forms, and advised him how these should be forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith the Quarterly Return for the Day School at God's Lake for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1923. As will be noted, the attendance for the quarter and the enrollment were very small. Mr. Kell, the teacher, assures me that the attendance is increasing, and that there were, at the beginning of February some 14 names on the roll.\n\nI may say that Mr. Kell has had to face a difficult task in the opening of a school at God's Lake. The Band is comparatively small, less than 300 people, and much scattered, not having been located on a reserve, and having divisions among themselves as to where they want the Reserve to be. Whether Mr. Kell has chosen the best situation for a School, I am not prepared to say at time of writing. He had no building and had to have a house built which would do for a School as well.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWm. Gordon,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Aest.

Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMan.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith the Quarterly Return of God's Lake Indian Day School for the Quarter ended June 30th.\n\nI may say that it is a question whether the site chosen by the Missionary last year for the home for the Missionary, the church and school was the best that could be chosen from the school standpoint. The place chosen was close to the new site of the H.B.C., the only other white people in the district. The largest Indian community of any stability was, however, at the Chief's location, some twelve miles distant.\n\nI presume that the permanent site for the reserve and the Mission being chosen this summer, will stabilize matters, so that wherever the Mission is located, if at all wisely chosen, there will shortly be a community, and a better opportunity for a school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm.

I found 11 boys in attendance in the afternoon; there had been 18 girls present in the morning. Owing to the smallness of the building in which the classes are held, it is best to have half day school for each. The spirit of the school was good and progress is being made.\n\nWm.

Mr. Stinson has had several years experience in teaching and holds a first-class certificate for the Province of Saskatchewan. He expects to be a candidate for the ministry of the United Church, and will, I am quite sure, be a very helpful influence in the community during the summer. He has had experience in teaching Belgian, Ukrainian and other non-Anglo-Saxon children, which would be of assistance in the work which he is undertaking.\n\nI am just wondering whether or not Mr. Indian Agent Gordon will have at Norway House sufficient school supplies to outfit Mr. Stinson for this extra three months' session which we are preparing to hold at Gods' Lake.

I shall be pleased if you will inform him of his appointment and arrange with him to take up duties on or about June 10th, next.

There were 48 pupils on the roll, and the average attendance was 19.28.\n\nThe attendance up to Treaty payments was much more regular than after this, I presume, was largely due to the fact that the berries were ripe after treaty, and the families went out to pick berries.\n\nI consider that the experiment was a success, and would like to see it tried again next summer.

There is not any doubt that he\nwould do very much better the second summer.

She also intimates\nthat she is not certain about next fall and winter, but thinks that\nshe will probably find it necessary to find a location somewhere\nnearer home (Calgary). In the event of her desiring to leave at\nthe close of the summer session, say, the middle of September, we\nshall find it necessary to secure another teacher. Mrs. Chappell,\nwho is the wife of our missionary there, holds a first-class\nteacher's certificate for the Province of Saskatchewan and has had\nseveral years' experience.

The Department is approving of his appointment, with salary at the rate of $4 a teaching day.\n\nIf you consider any classroom supplies are required, you should forward a requisition at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMr. Gordon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House,\nMan.\nJanuary 6th,\n1933.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Gods' Lake School.\n\nFor two years we have been conducting an experiment at Gods' Lake by sending in a summer teacher. Five years ago the Indians were quite sure that they preferred a native evangelist to a white missionary-teacher, and, at their request, the missionary-teacher was removed. Since Mr. Morley Coleman went in to teach the summer school they have seen their mistake, and on several occasions recently have petitioned us to send them a missionary-teacher. We have a good house, in which the missionary could live, and a new church, just completed, which we would be willing to use temporarily as a school-room.\n\nThe discovery of gold in that area has led to quite an influx of prospectors and miners, and reports reaching us from Winnipeg are to the effect that many others are preparing to go in as soon as spring opens up. It would seem, therefore, as if the time were ripe to provide the Indians of Gods' Lake with a better type of leadership for their own protection than the Indian evangelist who is there now can give them.\n\nWe are in communication with two or three young men who are graduating in Arts and Theology at Manitoba University in June and who would be in a position to teach the school in a most efficient way and at the same time give counsel and advice to the band, which they are sorely needing in their new and sudden contacts with an influx of white settlers.\n\nWe ask therefore that in the preparation of the budget for 1933-4, an amount be included as from July 1st to cover the salary of a missionary-teacher at Gods' Lake.\n\nI have not had the opportunity of getting a written communication from Mr. Gordon, the Indian Agent at Norway House, in regard to this matter, but I know from conversation with him that it has his hearty endorsement.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\nOttawa, January 11, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, requesting that a grant be provided for the salary of a missionary-teacher at God's Lake.\n\nIn this connection it is noted that the Church authorities consider there should be a missionary-teacher situated permanently at this point. During the past summer this school was conducted as a summer school only, the Department providing grant at the rate of $4 per teaching day; a total of $400 having been provided for the purpose. When preparing our Estimates for the coming fiscal year provision was made for the same amount. Owing to a possible cut in our Appropriation for 1933-34, it is doubtful if we will be able to provide more than the amount stated above. If you consider the amount provided would warrant you in carrying out the plan suggested in your letter, the Department will approve of the arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. K. J. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nFebruary 16th, 1933.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nRev. Mr. Beaton called at the Department yesterday and stated that the United Church was considering sending a qualified teacher to GOD'S LAKE.\n\nIn this event, he requested that the Department allow salary at the rate of $800 a year, it being understood that arrangements can be completed by the United Church. The new teacher will begin duties at GOD'S LAKE about September 1st, next.\n\nMr. Beaton was promised favourable consideration and he will write if he secures a qualified teacher.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Nomination of Teacher for Gods' Lake.\n\nOn the occasion of my last visit to Ottawa, I discussed at considerable length with Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Phelan the question of conducting a summer school at Gods' Lake in Northern Manitoba, as has been done for the last two years. It was decided that, if we could find a missionary-teacher of the right type, it would be preferable to have him go in to stay for the full year. We have a new and very comfortable church building there now, which can be used as a school-room.\n\nI wish to nominate for the position of teacher at Gods' Lake Mr. Fred W. Stevens. My understanding is that the grant will be at the rate of $90.00 a month, beginning September 1st. Mr. Stevens, as you will remember, was at Oxford House for two years. Since then he has taken two years' Arts work at the University of Manitoba. When I was in Winnipeg recently I checked up on his work pretty closely. He has apparently grown a good deal in every way during the time that he has been in college. I know that Mr. Russell Ferrier felt that during the last year he was at Oxford House he was not over-industrious, but I am assured by those who have been closest to him that there will be no difficulty on that score now. He has been doing volunteer work with some boys' groups in one of our non-Anglo-Saxon Missions in the North end of Winnipeg and has made quite a success of it.\n\nMr. Stevens has a considerable speaking knowledge of Cree, which will be a decided asset in a backward community like Gods' Lake, which has been on the whole less responsive than any of our fields in Northern Manitoba.\n\nHoping that this nomination will meet with your approval,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MT\nOttawa, June 20th, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, nominating Mr. Fred W. Stevens as teacher of the God's Lake School. The Department fully intended to carry out the promise made to you when you visited the Department in February, last, but, recently, it has been found necessary to make another reduction in our appropriation. Under these circumstances, I regret that it will not be possible to allow salary at the rate of $60 a month, beginning September 1st, as was understood at the time of your visit.\n\nIn view of this fact, I presume that your Board will not wish to send Mr. Stevens to God's Lake. However, it might be well to leave this phase of the matter in abeyance until you visit the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nActing Superintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nIn checking over our records in preparation for an Executive meeting on January 23rd to wind up the business of 1934, I discovered that we have received no returns from the Department on account of Mr. Fred W. Stevens who taught the Day School at Gods' Lake during the summer. According to Mr. Stevens' letters to us, he taught 48 days. He left Gods' Lake rather suddenly at the end of August as he received a lucrative offer from the Manager of the mines to supervise some work which was being done in connection with the new power plant. There is just a possibility that he failed to forward to Mr. Gordon, at that time Indian Agent at Norway House, his School Report. There is also the possibility that it may have been forwarded to Mr. Gordon and, in the transfer of the Agency which has taken place since then, been lost sight of. In any event, I would greatly appreciate your immediate attention to the matter. Mr. Stevens was doing very good work in the School as I can testify from personal observation because I was at Gods' Lake for nearly a week towards the end of July.\n\nEnclosed you will please find invoices from Canadian Airways Limited for transporting 18 pounds of school supplies into Indian Lake. As this account is charged against us, the Department may feel at liberty to pay it directly to the Canadian Airways and notify us that it has been cared for.\n\nThanking you for your attention to this matter, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6234, file 513-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 17, 1935.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, I beg to say that a cheque will be issued and sent to you for $168.00 in payment of the period during which Mr. Fred W. Stevens taught the God's Lake Summer School in 1934.\n\nYou will be advised under separate cover regarding the invoice from Canadian Airways for transporting school supplies to Island Lake.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.-P.

Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nApril 30th,\n1935.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Summer School, Gods' Lake\n\nI wish to nominate as teacher for the School at Gods' Lake this summer Rev. Keith S. Armstrong, M.A. Mr. Armstrong is a graduate of the University of Toronto and of Emmanuel College. He has been on the ground for a year and is thoroughly conversant with the needs of the Indians. He will do a very much better job in the matter of teaching the school as a result of his knowledge of Indian nature and the Cree language than the young fellows whom we sent in for a couple of months in previous years.\n\nSupplies for the school - if they have not already been sent - may now be forwarded by air mail at regular parcel post rates.\n\nHoping that this nomination will meet with the favor of the Department,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MT\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nA summer school has been conducted, during the past several summers, on the Gods Lake Reserve, No. 23, Norway House Agency, electoral district of Nelson, Man.\n\nIt is intended to re-open the school this coming summer, for a period of four months. This school is conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada, and the authorities of that Church have nominated Reverend Keith S. Armstrong, M.A., for the position as teacher. He is a graduate of the University of Toronto and has had experience among the Indians. The salary allowed is at the rate of $4.00 per teaching day.\n\nI would request your authority for the re-opening of this school during the coming summer and for the appointment of Rev. Keith S. Armstrong, M.A., as teacher.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, May 21, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, nominating the services of Rev. Keith S.

The salary allowed will be at the rate of $4.00 for each teaching day the school is in operation. Mr. Agent Lazenby, Norway House, is being informed of the approval granted for the appointment of Mr. Armstrong.\n\nClassroom supplies for this school are being forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

As suggested at that time, we sent in Mr. Robert J. Hiltz, formerly a teacher on the staff of the Toronto Public Schools and now a student at the University, having completed second year Arts.\n\nMr. Hiltz left Winnipeg on the boat which sailed June 1st and intended to go into Gods' Lake by aeroplane, so that he would probably arrive there by the 5th or 6th, and the school - if the Indians have returned from their winter camps - would be opened on June 8th. We understand that the usual terms of remuneration are to prevail in his case.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have an application from Mr. Harry Meadows who served there last year to go back. He is anxious to keep up his connection with the Indian work so that he may serve after Ordination in that field. In this letter he says that, if the School is to be kept open during the summer, he will write a letter to the Chief asking him to get as many people as possible to stay at the Mission this year as it is only by getting the co-operation of the Indians that they can get a good attendance.\n\nI shall be glad if you will let me have this information as soon as possible.\n\nWith best regards, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Would it be possible for the Department to assume some responsibility for the transportation of the Teacher from wherever he may be to Gods' Lake?\n\nIt will, of course, be obvious that the School not being carried on during the winter the Teacher will leave Gods' Lake in the Fall and go back in the Spring. Of course, if the Department were thinking of re-establishing this as a yearly School, the matter would be different; but whilst the grant of $4 a day is reasonable yet owing to the limited season it means that the Teacher, whoever he may be, incurs a great deal of expense, and in most cases this has been borne by the Church. I wonder whether your Department would not consider bearing this.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:BJ\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa,\nMarch 1, 1938.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo with reference to the teacher at the God's Lake United Church School.\n\nPresent regulations do not permit our paying travelling expenses of teachers proceeding to or returning from an Indian Day School.\n\nHowever, in order to assist you it has been decided that for the period during which the teacher conducts this school during the coming summer an amount of $5.00 a day will be allowed.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

In making the grant to the Teacher $5.00 a day instead of $4.00, the Department will assist somewhat in meeting the travelling expenses of the Teacher. Whether this will be sufficient to make it possible for us to send a Teacher in is not quite clear, but on Dr. Dorey's return from the Maritime Provinces I will discuss the matter with him.\n\nThanking you for your action in regard to this, believe me\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRBC:BJ\nMr. R.

Both missions were visited at this reserve and both day school teachers interviewed. The gardens at this reserve have been much neglected this year, as practically all the able bodied Indians and their families have been at the God's Lake Gold Mine, cutting fuel wood for the mines since early spring. The mine pays the Indians $4.50 per day and each ton of wood cut is delivered and $2.00 per cord if left in the bush where it is cut. Both R.C. and U.C. day schools at this reserve are 'Seasonal' schools, operating from June to September each year only. This year, owing to the Indians being at the mines, both teachers were given authority to hold their schools near the mines. The R.C. school teacher moved to the mines but was not very successful in getting attendance at the school, so moved back to the mission. The U.C. school teacher, when he heard the result of the R.C. teacher's move, remained where he was, and neither school was having much success apparently, in getting children to attend. The teachers were hoping, however, that the situation would improve during the next two months.\n\nP.G.

(RG 10, Volume 6234, file 513-1, part 1)\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Department,\n\nMy son Gilbert C. Johnson taught an Indian Summer School at Gods Lake last summer, and completed his work there near the end of July and handed in report into the office at Portage House. Also a few days ago I heard word from him that he had not yet received a cheque for his work. It seems to me that it is very unfair that a young fellow who is laboring to get through college should have to wait for over two months for his cheque & stagger along for the first two months of his studies because borrowing from whomsoever he can find to borrow from until even then his board at Gods Lake paid for just because the school government must needs move at such a leisurely pace. Surely there is roomway of speeding this on after and lift the heavy load from the boys' winter hearts.\n\nYours obedient servant (Signed) E.W. Johnson (D.D.)\n\nIndian Affairs.

C. Johnson for his services at the God's Lake school during the summer of 1939 is due to the fact that we have not yet received a return showing the names of the pupils, days taught etc. This information is required before any payment can be made.\n\nPrevious to the receipt of your letter we had a communication from Rev. Geo. Dorey, D.D., Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions, United Church of Canada, with regard to the nonpayment of your son's salary. We immediately communicated with the Indian Agent and today I am in receipt of the following reply:\n\nREPLYING MR HOEYS TELEGRAM OF TWELFTH INSTANT MR JOHNSONS RETURN FOR GODSLAKE SCHOOL IN MAIL STOP MAIL SERVICE HERE SUSPENDED OCTOBER FOURTEENTH AND DO NOT KNOW WHEN TO BE RESUMED\n\nAs soon as this return is received payment of salary due to your son will be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Hoey's telegram of yesterday's date, requiring that the teacher's Return for the God's Lake U.C. Seasonal Day School be sent at once.\n\nI had been under the impression that this return had been sent in long ago, but on receipt of Mr. Hoey's wire I looked into the matter immediately, and found that the copy that should have been forwarded to the Department, had inadvertently been put into the file here, inside this office copy. I regret very much the delay in this return reaching the Department, and the inconvenience that has been thereby caused, both to the Department and to Mr. Johnson, the teacher.\n\nMay I say here, that there has been no mail in or out of Norway House since October 14th last, and the return for the God's Lake R.C. School will not have reached the Department as yet, as it was mailed on October 17th.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G.

Lazenby,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Man.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nDr. Carmie of the United Church Home Missions at Winnipeg has informed me that he has recommended me to your office for the position as Teacher of the God's Lake Seasonal Indian Day School. I understand that up until last year that your Department has paid the fare of the teacher in to the Lake & from Winnipeg besides the regular pay of $6 per teaching day. Upon checking up on the fare I find that the plane fare return is $17.00, but if I were to go by boat to Norway House and then from there to the Lake by plane it would be approximately $80.00. The latter way is the cheapest possible way; however it will take a week or so longer.\n\nI would like to find out if the Indian Dept. would resume their practice of bearing the burden of this extremely high fare. You will realize\nthat if the teacher is to pay the fare out of his salary besides boarding himself while there he will have very little left for his summer's work as the season is so short.\n\nI am a law student and it has been a couple of years since I taught school, so you will realize the financial situation I am in. I am not in a position to finance this trip\u2014fare, clothes, food, etc., just at present and I believe it would be difficult trying to get a loan, as I understand the total amount of remuneration is not certain\u2014it depends on the number of days the Indian children will attend school.\n\nWill your Department bear the expense of the fare as it has done in former years? This summer teaching job means a great deal to me as it will help me to study another year at law school.\n\nI trust I shall receive a favorable reply from you in the near future as I hope you will understand the position I am in. I expect to leave Winnipeg during the last week in May, so I hope your answer will arrive at the above address before that time so that I can make the necessary arrangements. Thank you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nClarence W. Pybus\nOttawa,\nMay 6, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 1st instant requesting the Department to allow your transportation to and from the God's Lake U.C. Seasonal School.\n\nRegulations that have been in force for several years do not permit our paying the transportation of teachers proceeding to or from an Indian day school.

Pybus as teacher of the God's Lake Seasonal School.\n\nI am today in receipt of a letter from Mr. Pybus requesting us to pay his transportation to and from the school. For your information I enclose copy of my reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo. Dorey, D.D.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe - Gods' Lake School\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of May 6th, with reference to Mr. Pybus' request that the Department pay his transportation to and from this school.

Indian School at God's Lake.\n\nI am given to understand that the teacher who taught here last summer did not receive his cheque for his summer's work until sometime in January of this year. Whether this is a common practice in your department or whether it was merely an oversight, I do not know, but you must admit that it is both unfair and inconvenient to a teacher to withhold his cheque.\n\nTherefore, since I have had to borrow money to finance the fare and the summer expenses up here, could the more suitable arrangement not be made this year? Would it be asking too much to have you send a cheque for $200 by the first of September and the balance could be paid when the Summer's Report is in at the end of September. I do not feel that this suggestion is unreasonable.\n\nAugust 7/40.\nas you, no doubt, have some idea of the difficulties and inconveniences under which we work in this North Country. Usually teachers' salaries are paid by the month so in this case I hope you will see that it is only just that a cheque be issued after the Summer Session is over.\n\nI trust that you will find it convenient to comply with my request as I certainly believe it is only fair.\n\nYou need not worry about proof for my statement that over 45 teaching days have been completed, as I am a Law Student and realize the seriousness of trying to obtain money under Sales Returns.\n\nThank you,\n\nLawrence W. Pylus\n\n(Home Address - Manitou, Man.)\nOttawa,\nAugust 16, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant with reference to your teaching services at the God's Lake U.C. Indian Day School. It is the usual practice of this Department to pay salaries promptly. The experience of the teacher last year was by no means wholly our fault.\n\nI have no doubt that you have had the school in operation for the period you state and consequently arrangements are being made to forward you a cheque for $225.00.\n\nHowever, to comply with regulations it is necessary for us to have a return showing the names of the pupils, number of days they attended etc. I enclose the necessary form for this purpose and you should complete it and return it to me immediately. You should state on the form the exact date on which you first opened the school and the return should cover the period from that date to August 1, 1940.\n\nWhen the season closes you should forward a similar return for the period August 1 to date of closing and when forwarding this second return you should show on it the exact date on which the school was closed.\n\nWhile you give your home address in your letter you do not state definitely whether you want the cheque sent to that address or to your present location. It is, therefore, being sent to God's Lake.\n\nMr. Clarence W. Pybus,\nU. C. Indian Day School,\nGod's Lake, Man.\nI also enclose staff questionnaire form which you should complete at once and return to me together with the return for the period from the date on which the school opened to August 1, 1940.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nNorway House, Man:\n23rd September 1940.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to forward herewith the Teacher's Report concerning the God's Lake United Church Seasonal Indian Day School, for the period August 1st to September 18th 1940, the day on which the school was closed, a previous report having been sent direct to the Department covering the season prior to August 1st, according to the teacher.\n\nMr Pybus, the teacher, called at the office a few days ago, and advised me that he had decided to close the school, due to the very meagre attendance, as it was no use carrying on any longer.\n\nThe God's Lake Gold Mine has been letting contracts for a very large supply of cordwood this summer and the Indians have been working on the job of getting out the wood, taking their families to the bush with them, thus greatly decreasing the number of potential school pupils, as the mine is 18 or 20 miles from the reserve.\n\nThe day school question on this reserve is very unsatisfactory on account of the proximity of the Gold Mine, and the teachers have great difficulty in trying to maintain even a fair attendance average.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G.

On the same day, Mr. Pybus, who had been teaching the God's Lake U.C.Day School this season, returned to Norway House, having closed the school earlier on account of the fact that most of the Indians had left the reserve for the gold mines, 18 miles away, to work there, and had taken the children with them. In consequence, there were not enough pupils left at the reserve to warrant keeping the school open.\n\nP.G. Lazenby\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe - Gods' Lake Summer School\n\nI beg to nominate for summer teacher Mr. R. K.

K. McLean for the position of teacher at the Gods Lake Summer School.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. McLean has not yet secured a professional certificate. In view of the scarcity of teachers likely to exist in the province of Manitoba, it is difficult to insist upon the employment of fully qualified teachers at seasonal schools, for the time being at least. Mr. McLean will be allowed salary at the rate of $5.00 a teaching day. He should notify the acting Indian agent at Norway House regarding the exact date on which he intends to take up his duties at the Gods Lake School.\n\nThe records here indicate that the attendance at this particular school last year was in no sense satisfactory. In view of this fact and the scarcity of male help throughout the Dominion, I have been wondering if it is sound policy to re-open a number of our summer schools this year. I hesitate to reach a decision in respect to the matter, however, until the question has been carefully reviewed by you and Dr. Cochrane and perhaps the members of the Home Mission Board. You might let me have, in due course, any comments you may care to make in respect to the matter.

Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man.\n\nIn a brief recently submitted to the Minister by the churches co-operating with the Department in Indian educational work the necessity for increased educational facilities in the northeastern portion of your Agency was stressed. Special reference was made to the God's Lake District and today I am in receipt of a letter from Rev. Geo. Dorsey, Associate Secretary, Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada, which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Our Missionary at God's Lake tells me that they can provide a school room by converting part of the old house and that the arrangement which should be in force would be for the teacher to carry on for the same months as is done at Island Lake.\"\n\nPlease let me know as soon as possible your opinion regarding operating both the God's Lake U.C. and the God's Lake R.C. Day Schools on a ten-month basis during the academic year 1943-44 instead of the usual seasonal schools which have formerly been conducted. In your reply you should let me know definitely if you consider the Indians would take advantage of this additional facility for the education of their children. You should also let me know the exact dates between which you believe the schools could be operated.\n\nYou should also comment on the statement made by the United Church Missionary regarding the building which he states could be converted into\na classroom. You might let me know if the Roman Catholic authorities can also make a building available.\n\nIn the event of your recommending a longer term for these schools, you should let me have an estimate of the expenditure that will be required to convert the buildings into classrooms and the extra expense that would be necessary for fuel, janitor services and other current expenses.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nNorway House, Man:\n5th February 1943.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.:\n\nI received a letter some time ago from Rev. Kenneth C McLeod, the United Church Missionary at the God's Lake Reserve, in connection with the God's Lake U.C. Indian Seasonal Day School. Mr. McLeod proposes that this school be made an all year round school, similar to those at Oxford House and Island Lake Reserves, and states that if this school had been in operation, there could have been an average attendance, since the school closed in September last, of at least 8 pupils, and that with the prospect of the God's Lake Gold Mines closing down this coming summer, there would no doubt be a better average attendance than this.\n\nBefore making any definite recommendation in this matter, I should like to discuss it thoroughly with the Indians who have children of school age, and find out what promise there may be of there being a good regular attendance at the school. There is also a seasonal day school at this reserve under the R.C. auspices, which in similar circumstances might also be made into a year round school, depending upon what prospects there may be of getting a good regular attendance throughout the year.\n\nFor the present therefore, I would recommend that the matter be left in abeyance until next treaty time, when I will have an opportunity of going into it very fully.\n\nP.G. Lezenby\nIndian Agent.\nNorway House, Man:\n8th February 1943.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Mr. R.A. Hoey's letter No; 123-3-1 of the 29th ultimo, regarding a proposed change in the operating of the U.C. and R.C. seasonal Indian Day Schools at the Cod's Lake Reserve, from a 'Seasonal' basis to a ten month basis as is done at the Island Lake Reserve.\n\nIn reply, I may say that I received a letter from the United Church Missionary at Cod's Lake on this subject, and I wrote to the Department on the 5th February concerning it, and in which I recommended that the matter might be left in abeyance until I could visit the reserve next treaty time.\n\nWithout going into the matter carefully and thoroughly on the spot, discussing it with the Indians who have children of school age and finding out definitely what prospects there are of getting, and keeping up a regular attendance at both the U.C. and R.C. schools at this reserve, I should hesitate to make any definite and final recommendation in the matter, as there are so many aspects to take into consideration.\n\nAt the present time, while the Cod's Lake Gold Mine is in operation, a considerable number of the Indians are living near the mines, about 18 miles from the reserve. If, however, the mine closes down this summer, as it is rumoured, this would make a difference in the number of children available for attendance at these two schools, as the Indians with their families would move back to the reserve to live.\n\nDuring the 'Seasonal' period these two schools operated last summer, the average attendance at the U.C. School was 12.29 and at the R.C. School, 6.1, but if these schools were to be carried on during the winter this average would drop, in circumstances as they are at present.\n\nWill you please advise me if the Department is in accord with my opinion that the making of any definite recommendation should be left in abeyance until after next treaty time, which would be about the middle of August.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lazenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Educational Facilities at God's Lake\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nIt will be satisfactory to the Department if you make a thorough investigation of educational facilities at God's Lake and at Island Lake at the time of each treaty payment. A full report on these facilities, together with any recommendations you may care to offer, should reach the Department immediately following your inspection.\n\nThere is in the Department a feeling that the educational facilities provided in many of the outlying districts should be more prominent in character. What I would particularly like to see would be a teacher or welfare and training officer appointed on a yearly basis. This man, in my judgment, should be responsible, under the agent, for the general welfare of the Indian population. He should be responsible for the distribution of rations, medicine, etc., and his wife, if he were a married man, should be encouraged to organize Indian women for the raising and distribution of vegetables, etc. There is, of course, the question of two distinct and separate groups of Indians belonging to two different churches, which presents certain difficulties. However, we should not use this condition as a pretence or an excuse for not providing better educational facilities for the Indian population. This question has been ever in our mind and, if you have an opportunity, discuss it with men experienced in missionary and educational work in these districts. I am personally convinced that we have reached a time when our educational policy in such districts should be thoroughly revised.\n\nR. A.

He is twenty-five years of age; has had a little experience in teaching; and has been in charge of a class of delinquent boys in the Y.M.C.A., with whom he has had some success.\n\nIn your reply, would you please indicate the rate of remuneration and the period of teaching.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\nOttawa,\nMay 24, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, the Department approves the appointment of Mr. David Friesen as teacher of the God's Lake Seasonal School. Salary will be allowed him at the rate of $5.00 a teaching day and the usual term for this school is three months. The previous teacher usually opened the school on or about June 1.\n\nIn connection with this school you will recall that earlier in the year you wrote with reference to having it operated for a period of ten months during each academic year. I wrote to the Indian Agent at that time and, after an exchange of correspondence with him, it was decided that no decision could be made until after Treaty time in August on which occasion the Agent will discuss the matter with the Indians. Consequently we are only approving the operation of this school this year on the same basis as in previous years.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Geo.

Lezenby, Indian Agent, Norway House, Man.\n\nOn the nomination of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada the Department has approved the appointment of Mr. David Friesen as teacher of the God's Lake Seasonal School. He will be allowed salary at the rate of $5.00 a teaching day and will open the school early in June and keep it in operation for a period of three months. This is the usual term at this school. I enclose the necessary forms which he should complete and return as soon as he begins duties.\n\nIn other years there has been complaint on the part of the teacher of this school regarding the delay in payment of his salary. This was caused by the fact that the teacher did not forward a return until the completion of the three-month period. If the new teacher requires the money, he should forward a return at the end of each month. On receipt of this return the amount due him for that period will be paid.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nNorway House, Man:\n27th August 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith further reference to Departmental letters of January 29th and February 18th last, File 123-3-1, regarding the God's Lake United Church Indian Day School, and the proposal to make this an all year round school instead of a seasonal school as at present, I believe that when I was at this reserve for treaty payment last July, this matter was discussed very fully with the Indians at a band meeting.\n\nThe matter was put to the Indians from the viewpoint of the Department, that the department was anxious to see the Indians child educated and therefore was in favor of the Department spending a lot of money to keep a school teacher there if the parents were not going to co-operate and see that their children went to school. Quite a number of the Indians said that they usually took their families with them to their winter trapping camps.\n\nTo find out just how many pupils could be expected if the school were operated all winter, I asked the Indians, both United Church and Roman Catholic, how many of them would definitely promise to send their children to school during the winter, and in response, there were promises of 17 children for the United Church school, and 2 children for the Catholic school. Here I may say that the R.C. School is not open this summer at all, and Father Daniel who is the Priest in charge of the Mission, advised me that they were unable to secure a teacher.\n\nAfter due consideration of the whole matter I would recommend that the Department keep the United Church Day School open all this coming winter, and give it a trial, as out of the 17 children promised, one could expect an average quarterly attendance of about 8 or 10.\n\nThe present teacher of this school, Mr David Friesen, is getting along well but is unable to stay any later than the third week in September, after which he will be going back to University. Mr Friesen advises me that the present Missionary's sister-in-law would be able to take the position if it were offered to her. She has graduated from Normal School this summer. She is Miss T. Neufeld, c/o Peter J Neufeld, Morden, Manitoba. Probably it would be well to get in touch with Miss Neufeld and see if she would accept the position of teacher of the God's Lake U.C. School, and if so, have her carry on after the present teacher leaves about the third week in September.\n\nP.G. Lazenby,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Doctor Dorey:\n\nWe have had under consideration for some months the suggestion to operate the God's Lake U.C. School for the complete academic year. We have just received a letter from Indian Agent Lazenby in which he states that 17 children will be available during the coming winter. I, therefore, feel that it would be advisable to at least try the school for winter to see if we would obtain an attendance that would justify keeping the school in operation during the winter in future.\n\nI understand that Mr. Friesen will be leaving about the last week in September, as he intends to return to university work. Mr. Friesen has advised the Agent that the Missionary's sister-in-law, Miss T. Neufeld, c/o Peter J. Neufeld, Morden, Manitoba, would be willing to accept the position for the winter. Salary could be allowed her at the rate of $100.00 a teaching month, plus bonus. It would be appreciated if you would give this matter your immediate consideration and, if you concur, you might get in touch with Miss Neufeld with a view to ascertaining if she will accept the position.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

We have about three hundred children at present fit for school but no school to take them in. We have two small schools, one on each side of the lake, Roman Catholic and Protestant, but these are too small for the present population of school-age children. We would very much appreciate a boarding school instead of the day schools, and the children from our neighbouring reserves, God's Lake and Oxford House, could also attend. All the Indians from these Reserves could benefit by a boarding school, as well as by a hospital.\n\nI very much appreciate this opportunity to lay our grievances before the Department and will be very thankful if the Department can give consideration to our requests.\nAttention of Mr. R.A.

The salary allowed the teacher was at the rate of $5 a teaching day. However, you will recall my letter of September 14, 1945, in which you were advised that the Indian Agent recommended that the school be kept in operation for the full ten-month term. Although you tried to obtain a teacher following Mr. Friesen's departure, you were unable to do so and consequently the school has not been open during the past winter. I am not certain from your letter whether Mr. Harvey simply wants to go to God's Lake for the summer or whether he will be prepared to consider a ten-month appointment.

In view of her age and lack of experience I hesitate to confirm her appointment. I am not certain if you have a resident missionary at God's Lake.

This cheque I believe is in payment for my teaching for the period July 1st to Sept. 4th (inclusive) at the Indian day school at Shoal Lake, Man. (the United Church Board). However, as I calculate it, so that amount is in payment for only 49 teaching days, and as you can calculate for yourself there are 55 teaching days in that period - teaching 6 days per week as is the custom up there.\n\nHere's how I work out my calculation:\n\nMy earnings $281.74\nLess housing $36.84\nLeaving $244.90\n\nAt $5.00 per day, that comes out to be $\\frac{244.90}{5} = 49$ days.\nNow I figure you have made the mistake you have in this. If you will read the remarks I have written down the right hand side of my report you will see that the school was closed for six weeks July 31st - Aug 5th and therefore I could only honestly say that out of a possible 55 days I was only able to teach 49.\n\nNow it was no fault I knew that the school was closed for that period in fact I closed it only on the authority of the R.O.M.P. constable who advised such action to check the spread of a measles epidemic that was raging at that time throughout the reserve. Thus, sir, I think it only right that I should have your consideration in this point and that I should receive payment for that week when I was on hand to teach but through circumstances beyond my control was unable to.\n\nThen there is another point which I would like to raise with you about my salary and it is this. If you will check with your\nrecords as to my total summer earnings you will see that I have earned scarcely more than $300.* and yet I am expected to pay over $70.* in income tax. Now I realize that were I employed at that job of teaching at Lake all year round then such an income tax would be only just and fair in these times \u2014 But as you know I am a university student and was employed for the period three months only and in that period couldn't possibly, and didn't actually earn the minimum $650.* I would ask therefore that you check on this with the comptroller of the treasury and if possible please obtain a rebate for me. As you can well expect university expenses are by no means trivial and unless I obtain such a rebate \u2014 and soon \u2014 I will be in very uncomfortable circumstances to say the least.\n\nI trust that you will be able to give due and speedy consideration.\nHoping to hear from you in these regards at your earliest possible convenience,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nWm. Aitken Harvey.\nDear Sir:\n\nSome two weeks or more ago I wrote you with regard to a possible error on your part with regard to my summer salary for school teaching at the United Church (Chasmar) school at God's Lake, Man.\n\nSo far I have received no reply from you. As I said in that letter, I am put into some embarrassing financial circumstances as a result.\n\nWould you please look into this matter immediately and let me hear from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nWm. Aitken Harvey.\nOttawa,\nNovember 15, 1944.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant and regret that your letter of the 24th ultimo was inadvertently overlooked.\n\nAs you state, we allowed you payment for 49 days because that was the number of days that you showed on your returns that the school had been in operation. I note that you consider that you should be paid for 55 days and, as we desire to treat you fairly, we are making arrangements to pay you for the 6 additional days.\n\nI regret that there is nothing we can do about the income tax. As you know, present regulations require income tax to be deducted at the source and we have no other alternative than to follow these instructions. However, as you are a student, I agree with you that your salary for the year will not place you in the income tax bracket and you can secure a refund at the end of the year by preparing a tax return and submitting it to the income tax office in your province. Subsequently you will receive from them a refund of the tax we have deducted from your salary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nIndian Affairs.

School. We do not appear to have received any reply to Mr. Hoey's letter of August 28 and consequently we were not aware that Miss Hiebert had begun duties until we received a letter on December 28 from Indian Agent Lazenby stating that Miss Hiebert arrived at Norway House on September 13 last.\n\nAs a consequence we have not yet paid her any salary. When the school was operated as a seasonal one we allowed the teacher $6 a day. No decision has yet been made regarding Miss Hiebert's salary.

At the same time, I should like it understood that, if this scale is to be allowed in the case of Miss Hiebert, we shall have the right to make representations regarding all the other teachers in Northern Manitoba who are similarly situated and who are getting less salary.

Salary will be allowed her at the same rate as the preceding teacher, namely $100.00 a month, plus bonus.\n\nThis school had always been operated as a seasonal school, but, on the recommendation of Indian Agent Lazenby, we wrote you on April 24, 1944, requesting that the school be kept in operation for the full 10 month time. Miss Hiebert went to God's Lake some time during the month of September, 1944, and remained there until the end of May this year.\n\nThe returns received showed an enrolment of 19 but the average was only 8. This average attendance is not very satisfactory. However, the attendance may be larger during the coming winter, in view of the payment of family allowances. Under the circumstances, I feel that we should endeavour to keep this school open for the full academic year 1945-46, from September 1, 1945, to June 30, 1946. If this is done, we will be in a position to decide next year if the attendance warrants our operating this school on a yearly basis or if we should revert to the seasonal plan. I trust that Miss Loewen will begin duties on September 1.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Geo.

Day School\n\nThe school building is small and is the property of the United Church. It is a log building and in fair repair. The teacher last year was Miss Elsie Hiebert. The grades are as follows:\n\n| Grade | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1     | 14     |\n| 2     | 4      |\n| 3     | 6      |\n| 4     | 1      |\n| Total | 25     |\n\nThe attendance for the June quarter was 6.5. I noticed six pupils had not attended at all during the quarter. There is no teacher's residence in connection with this school and the teacher must board with the Missionary. I understand Miss Heibert has resigned.\n\nThese Indians are trappers and hunters and so are away from the reserve for weeks at a time.

(RG 10, Volume 6234, file 513-1, part 1)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nI was at God's Lake on Oct 20th and 21st. I held a meeting of a number of Indians at the RCMP Barracks, which is located at the Gold Mine. There is a considerable number of Indians living in or around the mine earning their living by fishing. Some of them have bought property from the Mining Co and have settled in. At the meeting a request was submitted that a school be opened. It is estimated that at least 25 children would be in regular attendance. There is a good school house belonging to the Mining Co. I interviewed the caretaker of the property and he assured me that there would be no difficulty in obtaining permission to use this school. There would be no difficulty in obtaining living accommodation for the teacher.\n\nThe request was submitted to me by Indians of the United Church and their proposition was that the school at the Narrows be closed and moved to the Mines. I suggest that the school at the Narrows be left and that another school be opened at the Mines. This would require the hiring of another teacher.\n\nThe R.C. Church when operating a school at the mines used their own buildings. As the R.C. hold a seasonal school, there would be R.C. children at the mine requiring school accommodation.\n\nI strongly recommend that if a new school should be opened at the mines that it be a non-denominational school and that the appointment of the teacher be made by the Indian Affairs Branch so that Indians of any faith could attend.\n\nSympathetic consideration of this request will be greatly appreciated.\n\nE.B.

Goodman,\nIndian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe File 25-B\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 21st ultimo.\n\nThis company is prepared to grant permission to the Indian Affairs Branch to use the school building at God's Lake. In order to carry out this matter in a proper manner we suggest that a formal agreement should be entered into generally covering the permission with an agreement to vacate the property (on 60 days notice) in case the company is fortunate enough to be in a position to reopen their mine property. We, of course, would not terminate unless it was absolutely necessary that we have the building back for our own purpose. The agreement should also cover the point of the Indian Department keeping the property in repair in the state it is now in and also that the Department insure the property against loss by fire or other damage and if the building is destroyed in any way to reinstate.\n\nIf you will consider the above points and suggest others that you wish to insert, we will have the agreement prepared immediately by our solicitors and forwarded to you or wherever you instruct for execution. We will then have both copies signed and sealed by God's Lake Gold Mines Limited and forward one copy to you, or to the Department as you desire.\n\nWe await your further advice in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGOD'S LAKE GOLD MINES LIMITED\n(Signed) Fred Larns, Secy-Treas.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAttention: Mr P. Phelan\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the God's Lake Gold Mines Limited, a copy of which I enclose. It seems to me to be a very generous offer and I would be glad to know your reaction to it. If permission is granted to open this school as an Indian Day School, I recommend that it be a secular school and that the teacher be appointed by the Department. I have spoken to both the Missionaries at God's Lake and they both gave me their verbal consent. The Missionaries are Father A. Rivard and the Reverend J.G. Kehler. It is understood that this school will be operated in addition to the two existing day schools.\n\nThere are many vacant houses adjacent to the God's Lake Gold Mine School, some of them fully furnished, which I have no doubt could be rented as a teacherage.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 20, 1946.\n\nMr. E. B. Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba,\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to opening a school at the God's Lake Gold Mines.\n\nI may be mistaken, but I infer from the Company's letter that the mine is not operating. If so, why are the Indians continuing to reside near it? How many children would attend and what prospects are there of securing a teacher?\n\nThe terms mentioned by the Company would not be satisfactory. The Government does not insure its own buildings. Consequently, we would not be willing to insure property belonging to someone else. If we decide to open the school, I think it would be better to pay the Company a nominal rent and they could insure the building themselves.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEXD.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nAttention: Mr P. Phelan\n\nI have to hand your letter of March 20th under file 123-15-1 received at this office April 3rd. Our mail service has been suspended from March 29th until the opening of navigation on Lake Winnipeg about June 1st. Hence the delay of this reply.\n\nThe God's Lake Gold Mine is not operating and has been closed for some years. The reason the Indians continue to live there is that there is a trading post there. They have purchased abandoned buildings, removed them from the mine site and have established a small settlement adjacent to the trading post. It is a stopping place on the winter freight route and it is convenient to their winter commercial fishing grounds. At a meeting of the Indians on one of my recent visits they guaranteed an attendance of at least 25 pupils should the school be opened.\n\nAs regards a teacher, I have spoken to Mrs Rollins who is at present working in the Residential School here and who says she met you once at Muncy. She is interested and willing to consider going to God's Lake as teacher next academic year. She would like to know what salary would be paid and whether or not she would come under the Civil Service.\n\nMrs Rollins is a very capable woman and a good teacher of considerable experience. She is a widow.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 17, 1946.\n\nMr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Building, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nI have been in correspondence with Indian Agent Goodman with reference to establishing an Indian day school at the site of the God's Lake Gold Mine.\n\nThe Company has offered to permit us to use the building that was formerly used for school purposes for children of employees when the mine was operating. For your information I enclose a copy of Mr. Goodman's letter of April 20, which has just reached this office.\n\nI understand that there is no reserve where the Indians are now living, as presumably the property is owned by the God's Lake Gold Mine Company.\n\nThe establishment of a school at this point would encourage the Indians to live off their own reserve. Possibly this is desirable, but in the past we have had similar requests and in the cases that we approved we invariably met considerable difficulties. Problems always arise when Indians live off their own reserve.\n\nI would appreciate having your views regarding the establishment of the school mentioned.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: School at God's Lake,\nYour file 123-15-1, dated May 17th.\n\nI have discussed this matter with Mr. Goodman and he is anxious that school accommodation be made available to the Indians living near God's Lake Gold Mine.\n\nThere is no reserve where the Indians now live, but as pointed out by Mr. Goodman they are now established near the mine and do not wish to return to the reserve. The location is close to a trading post, close to the winter fishing grounds and provides some labour when winter freighting starts.\n\nThe proposed arrangement except of the teacher's salary should not involve much expense and might be tried for one year as an experiment. If satisfactory it could be continued but if on the other hand the children did not attend it could then be discontinued.\n\nI know Mrs. Rollins and believe she would do good work if appointed.\n\nA. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nfor Manitoba.\nOttawa, June 1, 1946.\n\nMr. E. B. Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of April 20 and previous correspondence, in regard to conducting a school at the God's Lake Gold Mine in the academic year 1946-47.\n\nWe are prepared to favourably consider your recommendation, but before making a final decision, it is necessary to have certain points cleared.\n\nOne of these points is the matter mentioned in the last paragraph of my letter of March 20. I would like to know the amount of the rent that the Company will require for their building.\n\nAre there desks and other school equipment in this building?\n\nIs it heated by coal or wood and what would be the approximate cost of heating it during the winter?\n\nWhat would it cost to rent one of the furnished houses for a teacher's residence and what would be the cost of heating this building?\n\nIf the above matters can be satisfactorily settled, we are quite prepared to accept the services of Mrs. Rollins. We have been paying, at the God's Lake School, a salary of $100.00 a teaching month, plus 17\u00bd bonus. Would the same salary be satisfactory to Mrs. Rollins?\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nAttention: Mr. F. Phelan\n\nI have received your letter of June 1st re the school at the God's Lake Gold Mine in which you ask to have several points cleared up.\n\n1. Rent: As you know, the mining company offered it to us free provided the Government insured it. As the Government does not insure property, I am writing to the company in Winnipeg suggesting that they insure the building and that we pay the premiums in lieu of rent. This should not be a large sum and I will let you know as soon as I hear from them.\n\n2. Equipment: The school is equipped with desks, blackboards, supplies and textbooks, has a large heating unit, and the building is well ventilated. Some of the desks were borrowed and removed to the Day School at Oxford House but I think there are a sufficient number left.\n\n3. Heating: The heating unit burns wood in cordwood lengths, the building is 60' x 40' and it would probably require 15 cord of wood per annum and the teachers residence 5 cords. I could have the fuel rafted to the location and the caretaker of the mines has a saw and he would saw it into the required lengths.\n\n4. Teacher's Residence: This question I am unable to answer until I have communicated with the mining company in Winnipeg and personally visited the mining site and interviewed the caretaker to select a house. Last time I was there I mentioned the matter to the caretaker and he assured me there would be no difficulty. The rent would not amount to much.\n\n5. Teacher: I have spoken to Mrs. Rollins and she tells me that before she can give me a definite answer she will have to communicate with Dr. Dorsey and be released from her present undertaking.\n\nI will write you again after I have visited God's Lake for treaty payment, with regard to the foregoing.\n\nE. B. Goodman\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dep't of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nRe: Day School at God's Lake Gold Mine\n\nAttention Mr Bernard F. Neary\n\nFurther to my letter of Jun 7th 46, while paying treaty at God's Lake I held a Band Meeting and discussed this matter with the band and they assured me that they would support this school in the event that it is opened. I authorized them to start getting wood, 25 cords, 15 for the school and 10 for the teacher. There will be no trouble at all in procuring accommodation for a teacher should one be procured. I have to date received no reply from the mining company with regard to my suggestion in para 1 in my letter of June 7th 1946, but I do not think that there will be any difficulty there. Mrs Rollins whom the Den't were prepared to accept as teacher has left Norway House and accepted a position in Toronto so that a teacher will have to be procured for this school.\n\nThis school is not on a reservation and I strongly recommend that it be a secular school open to children of all faiths who happen to be living in the vicinity.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nCopy sent to Indian Agent Goodman.\n\nOttawa, July 24, 1946.\n\nMr. A.G.

We were hoping to secure the services of Mrs. Rawlings former teacher at Norway House but she has returned to Toronto.\n\nPossibly Indian Agent Goodman knows some teacher whose services could be secured. If he does, he has not given us her name.\n\nI understand that Mr. Goodman will be in Winnipeg in the near future to attend a meeting of the Indian Agents. You might discuss the whole proposition with him and review the possibility of securing a teacher.

Neary\n\nI have to hand your letter of Oct 1 with reference to the God's Lake United Church School at the Narrows.\n\nOn August 13 I received a letter from Miss Helen Loewen, stating that she had closed the school on August 8 and had left. She also stated that she had not heard just when the next teacher was coming and I assumed that the church was making a rapid replacement. I do not know in regard to these Church Schools where the church begins or where the State takes over in their administration. I understood that it was a matter entirely between you and the United Church or whatever denomination is involved. I know that it has nothing whatever to do with the nomination of other teachers in this Agency. They were nominated by Dr Dorsey and confirmed in that appointment by you. The first intimation I received was a request from Ottawa that I have their documentation completed. In any event as things are at the narrows, a female teacher could not go there as the mission is closed and there is no exchange and excuse for the teacher to go and the bay there is no white man within 20 miles. The rations and the drugs are at the U.C. Mission and there is no one there to issue either. In the last letter I received from the U.C. Missionary when he left, I gathered that the Chief had taken over. I had hoped before this to go in myself but have been unable to get an aircraft.\n\nOn September 11 I received a letter from Miss H Loewen wherein she stated she was overpaid and she asked me what to do about it and I referred her to you. I trust that she has written and refunded any overpayment.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nAttention: Mr Bernard F. Neary\n\nIn reply to your letter of October 5, 1946, I have to date been unable to get in to God's Lake but hope to do so this week if the weather permits. The United Church Day School at the Narrows was open and closed as indicated in the quarterly returns for this school. It closed finally on August 8 when Miss Loewen left. I was under the impression that the matter of replacement would automatically be taken up by Dr Dorey with yourself. Miss Loewen was overpaid for the month of August and for September and I advised her to communicate with you and I trust that she has returned the cheques in question.\n\nE.B.

Neary\n\nPlease find enclosed documentation for Miss Rosemary Fialkoski who commenced teaching at the God's Lake Gold Mine Indian Day School on October 8, 1946. She indicated to me that she did not wish to continue after December 15 and was ready to step out any time I could get a teacher who would take over for the school year. I inspected this school on October 23. There were 17 children present. They were well-dressed, neat and clean. The building is in excellent condition and very pleasant school building. It also was neat and tidy. I asked Miss Fialkoski, if, in the event that I was unable to procure another teacher she would carry on indefinitely but she would not commit herself in this regard.\n\nThe foregoing is the reason why I have been trying by wire to obtain the service of Miss R Vipond who is anxious to come. It would be a pity if this school had to close down for lack of a teacher.\n\nI was at the Narrows at God's Lake and the United Church Mission and school are both closed down and the Indians expressed considerable regret over this. I advised you in a previous letter that there was no teacher.\n\nThe ration house is at the U.C. Mission and I asked Father Rivard if he would supervise issuing of rations for the aged and destitute and he said that he would if I could find no one else who could do the work. Constable Bradley of the R.C.M. Police was away however I left a note requesting him to assist Father Rivard with the rations.\n\nE.B. Goodman,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 28, 1946.\n\nMr. E. B. Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\nGod's Lake United Church Indian Day School\n\nWe have received your letter of October 15 concerning the above school. We have stopped all payment of salary to Miss Loewen and have written to her requesting that she return to us the overpayment of salary she received.\n\nThe question which you raise, concerning school administration, can best be answered by saying that the United Church has in this instance the privilege of nominating teachers for this school but that the Indian Affairs Branch has the power of appointment and dismissal. Normally this is done by the Head Office of the Branch, due to the distances involved and the relatively poor communications. This does not apply to all day schools, as there are many where the teachers are appointed by the Department, upon the recommendation of the Indian Agent.\n\nI hope this clarifies the situation in your mind. In all other matters these schools are under your administration and should be opened and closed upon dates to be decided by you after reference to the Branch. In practically all circumstances we will accept the recommendation of the agent as to the opening and closing date of these schools, although we would prefer that they should conform to the dates laid down in our circular letter C-150-45. This was done in the case of this school, as recommended in your letter File 15 A of December 26, 1945.\n\nWe have written to the Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada concerning the closing of this school.\n\nBernard F.

He has suggested that we review all our schools with a view to cancelling off attendance of treaty and non-treaty children at our various schools, respectively. This will naturally save a lot of duplicating of effort in the payment of tuition fees from one school system to another. Would you request the teacher to note the attendance of these non-treaty children upon the new report forms which should reach her before the end of the December quarter.\n\nBernard F.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MDD\nGod's Lake Mine School (Non-Sectarian)\nInspected Sept. 12, 1947.\n\nThis is a notable achievement for Mr. Indian Agent Goodman. We have the use of a well-appointed school by paying insurance on it! We should supply a fire-extinguisher.\n\nI assured Mr. Goodman that you would approve a modest outlay for urgently needed kitchenware and a small cookstove.\n\nA rental of $7 a month for the house used as a teacherage is a fair charge.\n\nFuel wood may cost much more than the usual $5 a cord. Single logs have to be carried on the shoulder a quarter of a mile uphill from the water.\n\nIn such matters our administrative procedures may well be modified to permit our isolated local representatives power to make on-the-spot decisions that will receive the quick endorsement of senior administrators.\n\nI recommend that Mrs. Bennett (not Vipond) and other teachers who are at the mercy of casual mail service (Island Lake, Oxford Lake an example) be not penalized in salary payments because their applications for rating arrived late.\n\nR.T.O.\nMrs. Bennett conducts the school very creditably. She has obtained a complete set of the latest Manitoba publications on the course of studies. She is attempting to familiarize herself with the accepted teaching procedures.\n\nThe school needs a supply of:\n\n- Biscuits\n- Cod liver oil\n- Toothbrushes\n\nEnrollment is 31. Six of the children who attend are non-Indians:\n- 2 Suty\u0142a children\n- 2 Burton children\n- 2 Whiteway children\n\nMr. Suty\u0142a, who is an energetic citizen of Polish descent, supplies a boat in which many of the Indian children are ferried across \"the bay\" twice daily.\n\nMr. Suty\u0142a has also agreed to try to promote a working-bee among the Indians to repair two bridges so that the children may walk the road (25 minutes) when boating becomes impossible.\n\nThe other two white men have contributed little to the cause of education.\n\nThe question of joint support by the co-operating governments arises\u2014if we wish it to.\n\nJanitor service allowance was explained. Also \"lunch money.\"\n\nThis school is well worth our support. It has no denominational link.\n\nC.R.J. Clarke\n\nIndia Affairs.

Indian Day School\nOxford House No. Indian Day School\nRef. your 200-4A of April 2\n\nWe have checked our files to ascertain the number of days for which we paid Mr. McRea in constructing the Little Grand Rapids School. In erecting a prefabricated building there, it took him 106 days. It will presumably take him just as long, if not longer, to erect these two schools, and he will probably need a larger working force. Therefore, there is every possibility that with a large daily labour bill, board bills and transportation expenses, his tender will exceed the $6,000.00 figure quoted by Mr. McRea.\n\nWill Mr. McRea submit a firm tender for the erection of this building? If not, then we feel that a time limit of 100 days should be placed on each of these projects, otherwise the Department will be paying a daily board and labour bill of about $50.00 a day while these carpenters take their time over completing the school.\n\nCould you please discuss both the firm tender figure and the time limit with Mr. McRea and advise us as soon as possible concerning the decision reached.\n\nBernard F.

The enrollment was large for God's Lake, and the average was good, 15.43.

Of this amount, $240.00 represented payment for the December quarter, 1928, and $152.00 for the March quarter, 1929. No returns have been received for the June or September quarters.\n\nThe salary of the teacher of the Island Lake School for the quarters ended March 31st and June 30th, 1929, were included in cheque #1761, for $400.00, which was also sent to your Treasurer on July 5th, last. This cheque included $248.00 for the March quarter and $152.00 for the June quarter. The September quarter return has not yet been received.\n\nThe Department has not yet received the September quarter returns of the Poplar River and Cape Mudge Schools.\n\nWith reference to the school at Takush, B.C., which is known officially as the Smith's Inlet Day School, I would refer you to my letter of August 15th, last, regarding the payments for the quarters ended December 31st, 1928, and March 31st, 1929.

He is a prospective medical missionary and has had good standing during the three years he has been at Wesley. The Department is approving of his appointment, with salary at the rate of $4 per teaching day. He has no professional qualifications, but it is considered his services will be satisfactory at God's Lake for the coming summer. Please give him any assistance you can in his work at this school.\n\nIt is hoped that the classroom supplies which have been forwarded addressed to you will arrive in time to go forward to God's Lake with Mr. Coleman, who will see you when he arrives at Norway House.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

At the time you said this was impossible but that to help out you would raise the rate of pay from $4 to $5 which was quite satisfactory.\n\nHowever, in making adjustments with Mr. Meadows at the present time, he makes this interesting statement, \"The Department would automatically raise the grant from $4 to $5 per day as this was my second term with them, without regard to expenses\". May I ask if there is such a regulation in your Department that a teacher serving for the second year is entitled to more than one serving for the first? If there is, then I am sure that you will be glad to reconsider the proposal which was made to us last Spring as this hardly helps us out.\n\nWith kindest regards, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD:BJ\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is difficult to understand why Mr. Meadows stated that it was our custom to automatically raise the grant from $4.00 to $5.00 a day in the case of any teacher who was engaged for a second term. This statement is incorrect. In this regard I might refer you to payments made for 1933 and 1934 during both of which years Mr. Fred W. Stevens was employed and was allowed $4.00 a day. I might also refer you to the years 1931 and 1932. In both of these years Mr. Morley H. Coleman was employed and he was only allowed $4.00 a day.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Hosey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nTo-day I received a cheque from the Comptroller of the Treasury for Two Hundred three Dollars and Seventy Cents ($203.70), which I presume you must mean to be the balance of my summer salary as teacher of the United Church Indian Sessional School at God's Lake during the past summer. You will remember you sent me a cheque about the second week in August for Two Hundred Twenty-one Dollars and Twenty-five Cents ($221.25) as I had requested a part payment in order to pay back monies I had borrowed to finance the journey in there from Winnipeg and my living expenses while there.\n\nSurely some mistake has been made in figuring out my salary as I was formerly told I would receive Five Dollars per day taught and I taught eighty-eight days during the summer, making a total salary of Four Hundred Forty Dollars ($440.00). In my report sent you about August 5th, I reported on days taught from June 4th to July 31st, which was forty-six days. In my report forwarded to you by Mr. Lazenby Indian Agent at Norway House, I reported on the period from August 1st to Sept. 16th which was 42 days. This makes a total of eighty-eight days taught and so I expected my salary to be Four Hundred Forty Dollars. Your two cheques to me, one dated approx. August 1st or 2nd and one dated Oct. 7th were for $221.25 and $203.70 respectively, which makes a total of only $424.95. This is $15.05 short of what you usually pay for eighty-eight days teaching. When you consider the expenses of plane fare to such a distant point and the living expenses in such an outlying area, you will readily see that the actual profit is not great and so $15.05 means quite a bit to me.\n\nI have thought that maybe 2 per cent was deducted for the National Defence Tax but that is hardly possible as I am a University Student and I do not make Six Hundred Dollars per year. Even if this two per cent were deducted, that still leaves $6.05 for which there is no account.\n\nIf you have been compelled to deduct the two per cent National Defence Tax, on all monthly cheques, then to what Department do I apply for the refund of such monies as my income is much less than $600.00 per year.\n\nWould you kindly rectify this error and send me the cheque for the balance of $15.05 or the $6.05 as the case may be, and if it is the latter please let me know to whom I must apply to receive the refund.\n\nI am very sorry to have to bother you in this matter but that much money means a lot to a University Student and also I am anxious to know how such a mistake could happen in your Department.\n\nI thank you for the cheque which I received to-day and trust that you will see fit to rectify any error that may have been made.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6234, file 513-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa,\nOctober 31, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant with reference to deductions from your salary as teacher of the God's Lake U.C. Seasonal School.\n\nDue to the fact that the daily rate of salary would result in your earning more than $1200.00 in a year this Department is obliged by law to deduct the 3% National Defence Tax. In your particular case the returns which you submitted showed that the school was in operation for 45 days from June 1 to July 31 and at the rate of $5.00 a day the amount due was $225.00. 3% was deducted for the period you were in charge of the school from July 1 to July 31 or an amount of $3.75. For the period August 1 to September 18 the return showed that the school was in operation for 42 days and the amount due you was $210.00. 3% of this amount is $6.30 which was deducted. You will note from the above that there was a total deduction for National Defence tax purposes of $10.05.\n\nIn view of your statement that your total yearly income will not exceed $600.00 you can apply for a refund of the above-mentioned amount of $10.05. Application should be made to the Inspector of Income Tax, Winnipeg, Man., from whom you can secure the forms that you will be required to complete.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. Clarence W. Pybus,\n21 Edmonton St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nMines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRes: U.C. Indian Summer School at God's Lake\n\nI thank you for your letter of Oct. 31st. You have explained why the amount of Ten Dollars and five cents ($10.05) was deducted and I shall apply for a refund of this amount by application to our Income Tax office in the Winnipeg as you suggested in your letter.\n\nHowever, there is still another Five Dollars ($5.00) unaccounted for as $15.05 was deducted from the amount which I had expected i.e., $440.00 (89 days at $5 per day). Your letter explains how this error was made. You state in the above-mentioned letter that the School at God's Lake was open for Forty-five days from June 1st to July 31st. If you will check the returns which I sent to you for this period you will find that they show that I taught 46 days and not 45 days as you point out. When you check up on the returns you will see where the error was made and I hope you will feel in a position to rectify it by sending me your cheque for Five Dollars.\n\nThe following is a statement of the number of days taught and the money already sent by you:\n\nTo: June 1-July 31st 46 teaching days @ $5 per day 230.00\nAugust 1-Sept. 13th; 42 teaching days @ $5 per day 210.00\n\nBy: Your cheque rec'd approx.

Davis Regional Supervisor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.H. Staunton,\nSupt. Nelson River Agency.\nDecember 7th, 1949.\n\nMr. R.S.

I have recently returned from God's Lake and I would not recommend returning any money to Mr. Sabiston until he finishes the school properly. I have written to you recently regarding the condition of this school.\n\nI would not recommend paying Matthews Construction Company either as there is much to be done on the inside of the Nelson House School. I did not visit this school as I did not think it was necessary after speaking to Mr. Law.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 513-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nAIR MAIL\n\nFebruary 21st, 1950.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of\nIndian Agencies,\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nRe: Your File 138/6-1-513\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 8th instant, our records show that the following balances are due on the contracts to which you refer in your letter.\n\n1. God's Lake Narrows - Elmer Sabiston - $500.00\n2. Nelson House U.C. - Matthews Const. Co. - $1,750.00\n\nIt is noted that you are not prepared to recommend at the present time that the above amounts be paid. However, your letter does not state a definite date when the remaining work will be completed by the contractors.\n\nIf at all possible, we are very anxious to have the work completed before the end of March, so that payment of any balances due can be made by the end of the current fiscal year. We have not provided any funds for the construction of these two buildings during the fiscal year 1950-51, as we expected them to be finished before that fiscal year commenced.\n\nPlease keep in touch with the situation at both schools, and let us have further information from you by March 15th. If the work at either or both schools is not completed by that time, it is our intention to request the Treasury Branch to issue cheques for the balances due, and\nthese cheques would be sent to you and retained by you until\nthe work was completed in a satisfactory manner. However,\nwe do not wish to adopt the latter procedure unless we are\nabsolutely obliged to do so.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nGOD'S LAKE U. C.\n\nI have just returned from the Fur Conference held at The Pas. While in the north I visited Island Lake and God's Lake Schools. In connection with the God's Lake school that Mr. E. Sabiston built I have to report that this man made a very poor job of finishing this school. The floor has not been nailed properly and only one coat of paint was applied and very poorly applied. I have phoned Mr. Sabiston requesting that he come to the office. I will instruct him to return to God's Lake and finish the school properly before he can receive further payment.\n\n----------------\nMr. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFurther reference to my letter of February 8, 1950, file No. 138/6-1-513 regarding payment to Mr. E. Sabiston in connection with the God's Lake School.\n\nPlease be advised we are holding $1,000.00 on the two schools - God's Lake and Oxford House. As the Oxford House School is finished I feel that we could refund the $500.00 on this school. However, the God's Lake School has not been completed according to specifications. There is only one coat of paint on the inside of the school, the hinges put on the kitchen cupboards were old hinges and were not counter-sunk. The doors of the cupboards were very poorly done. The kitchen cupboards have only been put up with plywood without two by two's to support them.\n\nIn my opinion Mr. Sabiston should go in and finish the job at God's Lake or make arrangements with someone in the locality to do the painting before he receives final payment. I spoke to Mr. Sabiston when he was in the office recently regarding the God's Lake School but he gave me no satisfaction as to what he intended to do.\n\nIf you would forward the $500.00 cheque - this being the deposit for the Oxford House School - I will forward same on to Mr. E. Sabiston.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 513-5, part 1)\nAIR MAIL\n\nMarch 15th, 1950.\n\nMr. R.S.

It is hoped that you can arrange with Mr. Sabiston to have the work done before the end of March.\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6235, file 513-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Gods' Lake School Building.\n\nA number of years ago the Board of Home Missions erected at Gods' Lake a small log building to serve as a schoolhouse. When the forest fire destroyed the church, this building was not burned and it was used for both purposes for a time. For the last two years, however, it has not been usable and the school has been held in the new church building under very unsatisfactory conditions, as there are no desks. Mr. Fred Stevens has assured the cooperation of the Indians and they have put up a new log school building. Before this can be used, it will be necessary to buy some equipment and to screen the windows and doors, as the school must be held from June to September when the mosquitoes are at their worst.\n\nThe Board of Home Missions has already made an appropriation to provide the desks and I am writing to ask if the Department of Indian Affairs could find $200.00 to reimburse Mr. Stevens for the outlay which he has made in putting up the framework of the structure. This seems a very reasonable proposition, and, when compared with the cost of the school buildings at Oxford House and Island Lake, provides the Department of Indian Affairs with a place where the summer sessions of this day school can be held for several years at a very modest expense.\n\nMr. Stevens acknowledges receipt of the school supplies which were sent in to Ilford and will be forwarding to the Department the bill for transporting them from Ilford to Gods' Lake. He was disappointed to find that there was no blackboard cloth included and asks if it would be possible for the Department to send him a couple of yards by mail. He will see that it is properly framed and mounted.\n\nTrusting that this request may meet with favorable consideration,\n\nI am\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\nNorway House, Manitoba,\nAugust 31, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith regard to your letter 123-3-5-August 7, and the God's Lake United Church Indian Day School, would say that I had a letter recently from Mr. Fred Stevens who is teaching there. In this letter he offers to proceed with the building of the school but suggested that he close the school although he has an attendance of thirty pupils on the day of writing, in order that he might give his full time to building. I presume his expectation was that the department would pay him his teachers salary while engaged on the building. I enclose a copy of the letter which I have written to him in reply, which letter expresses my opinion of the situation as it stands.\n\nUntil sufficient funds can be provided for the erection of a proper building which can then be suitably furnished and which could be expected to serve as a school for a considerable number of years, I am of the opinion that the church building will serve. With small expenditure this building could be fitted with tables and fairly comfortable seats, a portable blackboard and a small board and desk and it could be used during the summer months. It is unlikely that a yearly school will be practicable at God's Lake for some time to come. As a matter of fact, I am not in favor of any encouragement being given to the Indians to remain around the missions or the posts during the winter months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nKAG\n**WINNIPEG**  \nJune 26th, 1941\n\n**Dominion Government**  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \n538 Dominion Public Bldg.\n\n**TERMS:**\n\n**CASH BOUGHT OFF**\n\nPayments are required on account as work proceeds, and must be promptly paid upon completion of work.\n\nOverdue accounts are subject to interest at 6%.\n\n---\n\n**T.

These were made at the reserve from lumber bought from the R.C. Mission and cost $7.50 each complete. However, the R.C. Mission has no lumber on hand just now, and the lumber would have to be bought from the God's Lake Gold Mine at $65.00 per thousand feet. The Rev. K.C. McLeod, U.C. Missionary, has advised me that the necessary lumber could be bought at the Mine, and with the use of local labour the total desk cost would be approximately $9.00 each, making a total for the 12 desks required, $108.00.\n\nWill you kindly advise me by return mail if this amount can be appropriated for this purpose, so that the work may be got under way as quickly as possible.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nP.G.

Ungraded.\n\nThey might crowd in 30, in about\nhalf of those who could attend. Another 25\nattend the mine school and 22 can get\ninto the R.C. school. Total, 77 out of 125\nchildren in the settlements on the lake.\n\nThe United Church contingent urgently needs\na two-room school with living quarters to be\nbuilt near the present site. The Church should\nthen be requested to demolish the old mission house.\n\nThe Narrows settlement is about ten miles\nfrom the \"ghost\" town at the mine where our\nsub-agent (if one is appointed) might be able to\nsalvage much building material. Lumber is\nscarce at the Narrows. No saw-mill. The second\npicture shows the R.C.

He suggests that Mr. Bennett might bring out by water outdoor toilets for the United Church School at the Narrows. I presume the expenditure incurred would not be large and you can arrange to carry out Mr. Clark's suggestion.\n\nThe Department is prepared to allow an amount of $6.00 a month for the period October 1st, 1947 to April 30th, 1948 for purchase of materials to serve a hot drink to the pupils at noon.\n\nIf you can secure a cook stove, you may do so.\n\nYou may also arrange any other minor repairs to make the building reasonably comfortable throughout the winter.\n\nBernard F.

Goodman, Indian Agent,\nNorway House, Manitoba.\n\n1948-49 Building Program - Norway House Agency\n\nReference your letters of December 19 and December 27 - on File 9-3\n\nWe have taken the following action with regard to the proposed building of three new day schools and teacherages in your Agency:\n\n(a) Cross Lake N.C. Indian Day School -\n\nWe have forwarded a requisition to our Departmental Purchasing Agent for the building materials listed on your requisition. We have asked that these building materials be ordered to reach Edmonton not later than March 15, 1948. Inspector Hamilton is being forwarded a copy of this letter and is requested to approach the Lamb regarding the transportation of these supplies from Edmonton to Cross Lake.\n\n(b) Island Lake N.C. Day School -\n\nWe have forwarded a bill of materials for this school to our Departmental Purchasing Agent with the request that the supplies reach Ilford not later than February 15, 1948. We have asked that these supplies be forwarded via Johnson Transportation Company. If Inspector Hamilton wishes to advise concerning the two other transportation companies at Ilford, we will be glad to hear from him.\n\nYour comments concerning the gypsum board have been noted and we have substituted Ten-Tone, as required.\n\n........... Wish\nWith regard to the siding for the Island Lake School, we have substituted Insul-brick for Asbestos-siding shingles. We have found that Asbestos-siding shingles sustain a great loss in shipping even on the railways. Therefore we have replaced this item with Insul-brick and hope that it will prove satisfactory. If you wish literature on the method of applying Insul-brick, I would suggest you contact the firm supplying it when you receive the purchase order.\n\nGod's Lake Barracks U.C. Day School\n\nUnfortunately, North American Builders Limited have such a large quantity of orders from the Army and Department of Transport ahead of them, that they will not be able to build our prefabricated schools until late spring. Therefore, we have no alternative other than to place the order for this school and request that it be delivered as early in the winter as the tractor train shipments are made. We regret this action, but so many other concerns are ordering prefabricated buildings, that we must wait our turn for delivery.\n\nI would draw your attention to the policy of the Department in naming these day schools so as to provide a minimum confusion in our filing system here. At the present time there is considerable confusion concerning the naming of the schools in your agency. For example, we are now dealing with three Cross Lake Schools, namely,\n\nCross Lake Residential School,\nCross Lake U. C. Day School,\nCross Lake R. C. Day School.\n\nA similar situation exists at God's Lake, at Oxford House and at Island Lake. The inevitable errors have occurred in filing accounts, letters, etc., and in the filing of requisitions and orders.\n\nI have discussed this matter with Major Clark and we would like to hear your views concerning other names.\nfor certain of your schools, similar situations have arisen in other agencies when new schools were being built. For example, we have a school at Fisher River but a new one is under construction there now. Rather than have a Fisher River No. 2, we have accepted Mr. Indian Agent Lassus's suggestion that it be named the \"Burdoch Indian Bay School,\" after the present Chief. Major Clark suggested the name Sagitowek for one of the Cross Lake schools. We will expect to hear further from you in this regard.\n\nBernard F.

Albert Spence - worked Sept. 23, 24, 25 - was paid $1.75; $2.50; $1.90 total $6.15\n\nArthur Trout - worked Sept. 23, 24, 25 - was paid $1.75; $2.50 total $4.25\n\nGeorge Andrew - Sept. 23, 24, 25 - rec'd $1.75; $2.50; $1.90; $2.50 - $8.65\n\nAngus Andrew - Sept. 23, 24, 25 - rec'd $1.75; $2.50; $1.90; $2.50 - $8.65\n\nStanley Ross - Sept. 23, 24, 25 - rec'd $1.75; $2.50; $1.90; $2.50 - $8.65\n\nTotal $24.25\n\nTheir work included:\n- Tearing down the old washhouse towers\n- Demolishing the stone chimney and fireplace - a remarkably substantial structure, worthy of having another house built onto it!\n- Removing stones and mortar\n- Covering large opening left by fireplace removal with logs and thick insulation of moss\n- Closing-up and covering front door of school in similar fashion so as to make the school less drafty and more habitable\n- Covering large roof from the playground\n- Cutting out undergrowth which has grown up in front of and around the school\n- Doubling the size of the playground by cutting down the bush\n- Gathering brush in piles ready for burning\n\nB. George Andrews (Sr.) - Sept. 23; 24; 25 rec'd $2.50; $2.50; $1.90; $2.50 - $9.45\n\nHis work included:\n- Carrying & building tables in school for ending new lumber\n- Repairs to the interior of the school including fixing doors to allow them to close properly, fixing hags and latches; covering windows where the panes were broken; setting up camp heater & the chimney; cleaning stove pipes etc.;\n- Repairing old broken-down toilet, digging new latrine holes;\n- Ditching to run off surface water.\n\nTOTAL -(of A. & B.) $43.70\n\nI had been instructed by Mr. E.B. Goodham to pay for the work done with orders issued on the Hudson's Bay Co., this was impossible as the H.B.C. post closed down when their manager resigned. The H.B.C. trader, Mr. Rzinski, has an outpost here in charge of an Indian. Numerous lines of goods have been cut off stock in this store therefore we have been supplying the Indians out of our own supplies. Those working here have asked that they too be allowed to receive goods in place of orders. This was done & has led, possibly, to some confusion in the appearance of my accounts. I have since made arrangements with Mr. Rzinski that all future Indian Dept. work will be paid for with orders on his outpost; his trader will forward the orders to him, and he will bill the Dept. enclosing copies of my orders, though admittedly they are not enlightening. This work has been paid for by me, therefore payment should be forwarded to me rather than to Rzinski's outpost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHoward W. Gibson.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Kitty Anderson worked Sept. 9 & 10 @ $1.50 a day\n\n2. Nora Jean Haleson - Sept. 9 & 10 @ $1.50 a day\n\nTotal: $3.00\n\nApproximately 1/2 cords were used. This rate proved too high so the women were paid $2.00 a cord for 5-foot lengths and $1.50 for 1-foot lengths.\n\nSept. 25 - Nora Jean Haleson & Alice Bee - for 1/2 cords - $5.00\n\nSept. 27 - Mary Andrew and Janet Perch - for 3 cords - $6.00\n\nOct. 1 - Tina Hardinge & Alice Bee - for 3 cords - $4.00\n\nOct. 1 - Mary Andrew & Janet Perch - 2 cords (1-foot) - $2.00\n\nTotal: $18.00\n\nThe following was spent for digging the school garden for the purpose of raising vegetables for hot noon lunches next year:\n\nJohn George Trout worked 2 days, Oct. 23 and 24 - and was paid - $5.00\n\nDogs smashed several 10\" x 12\" panes of glass in the window of the school, got in and ate and destroyed a large quantity of food to be used for hot noon lunches. Then they proceeded to mess up, or should I say destroy, the school in an almost unbelievable fashion. This was during the night of Oct. 12th. The janitor nailed poles over the windows with 300 Indianapolis nails (which proved too short) but the next morning they were found pulled off and the same mess repeated within the school. The janitor then obtained spikes to hold the poles. On the morning of the 14th he found the poles chewed through and the mess repeated. Fortunately Mr. Gordon arrived soon after by plane and witnessed the mess and destruction. He ordered the Indians to tie up their dogs and issued an order that any dogs around the school were to be shot. The janitor later put a trap and a dog was caught and shot. It was one that had broken into other houses. We now have the windows replaced and wire surrounding over the window.\n\nOct. 14 - Elmotheo Nagos - for squabbling out school - $1.50\n\nOct. 15 - Martin Elliott - for squabbling out school - $1.50\n\nOct. 17 - Ellen Osgood - $2\n\n7 panes of 10\" x 12\" window glass purchased from R.C.

Day School -\n\n\"Unfortunately, North American Builders Limited have such a large quantity of orders from the Army and Department of Transport ahead of them, that they will not be able to build our prefabricated schools until the late spring. Therefore, we have no alternative other than to place the order for this school and request that it be delivered as early in the 1948-49 winter as the tractor train shipments are made. We regret this action, but so many other concerns are ordering prefabricated buildings, that we must wait our turn for delivery.\"\n\n...... AS\nAs you are probably aware, Mr. Clark has made an educational survey of the Norway House Agency and he has emphasized the necessity of providing a good school at God's Lake Narrows where there are a large number of children.\n\nMr. Goodman was also insistent for the needs of a proper school at God's Lake Narrows and it is felt that before we transfer these funds, we should have an opportunity of further discussing this problem. The present school at God's Lake Narrows is an old log building which is very dilapidated. Our records show that these Indian children have attended this school very well with an average attendance last year of approximately 26.\n\nI would like to discuss the situation, therefore, with you when I see you in Winnipeg next week.\n\nBernard F.

Mr. F. M. Hughes, Acting Superintendent at Norway House visited God's Lake recently and has advised me that there are no buildings suitable for our purposes.\n\nIt will be necessary for this material to go in during the winter. I believe this material could be purchased at The Pas more reasonable and from there shipped via Hudson's Bay Railway to Ilford.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S.

Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n536 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nGod's Lake Narrows Indian Day School - No\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of October 28, advising that none of the buildings at the God's Lake Mine is suitable for moving to God's Lake Narrows for use as a school building. This is regretted as we already have the following three buildings planned for next year's Estimates in the Norway House Agency:\n\n(1) Oxford House No. 1 School\n(2) Oxford House No. 2 School\n(3) Teachurgo - Island Lake R. C. School,\n\nYou will have noted our comments concerning the provision of prefabricated buildings for the two Oxford House Schools. Will Mr. Adams be able to build these three schools out of the materials provided, by next summer, or would it be preferable to supply prefabricated buildings at Oxford House No. 1; No. 2 and God's Lake Narrows?\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Hughes so that a decision can be reached in the near future as to the type of building most suitable for these three points.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Hughes\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to Department letter file 513-5, of the 4th instant, I have to advise that it is impossible to get in touch with Mr. Hughes at the present time.\n\nI would not recommend prefabricated buildings at the points mentioned, and would suggest that material be shipped in at the earliest possible date, as per Department specifications and material lists. I will be able to procure a builder if Mr. Adams is not available for work on the schools next summer.\n\nIf I am able to get in touch with Mr. Hughes a further report will be furnished.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nNOV 17 1948\n\nJW/ES\nDecember 21, 1948.\n\nMr. R. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n536 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n\nGod's Lake Narrows Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 207-48 of November 15\n\nImmediately your letter was received here, we began to prepare an outline design for a one-room Indian Day School with attached teacher's residence which could be erected at a lower cost than the present building.\n\nThis building will not have a full basement and will be heated by stoves and not by a furnace. It should, therefore, be much easier to erect and will serve our needs in the more northerly areas, where it is often difficult to put in a full foundation.\n\nI have been advised by our Chief Architect that he expects the first set of these plans to be ready about the middle of January. I hope that I will have a chance to show them to you during your visit here. A bill of materials is also being prepared so that we can order the necessary building supplies for both God's Lake Narrows and for Oxford House. In the meantime, we would appreciate full shipping instructions for the supplies to be forwarded to Mr. Bennett at God's Lake.\n\nBernard F.

Clark,\nEducational Survey Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Clark:\n\nWe were very pleased to receive your letter today of January 23rd stating that building materials were soon to arrive for our new school. We have not yet met Mr. Superintendent Taunton of Ilford but will consult with him later regarding the new school site. In the meantime we will be prepared to look after building materials if they arrive before he does.\n\nTractors are unable to get closer than to the Catholic Mission or to the Hudson's Bay Co. I will try to see Mr. Roy Bennett re his suggestions for the best possible placing of the materials. They could be moved here by bombardier from where the tractor leaves them or they could be moved by barge in the spring.\n\nThe location of the buildings in your drawing was correct but you confused the church with the school. Our house is located about 75 feet back of the church. The school is at present about 200 yards west, at the entrance of the Narrows. We made a new cement foundation for our house last summer just east of the present location but didn't get the house moved. This will be done in the spring. Then we plan to tear down the old church & build a new one east of here between the house & the cemetery.\n\nThe location for the new school would be best right on the location of the present one. We could arrange that the present building be demolished as we will have no use for it other than as a school. Here you would find the best foundation as, this land having been cleared & drained for many years, should provide solid foundation. There is a good sized clearing with gardens in front. A playground is at the back. A better drainage ditch should be dug at the east side as this part is wet during spring & rainy weather. The school, if on the present location, would face south-west. That is the windows would be parallel to the shore. We do not face south here, either but somewhat westerly but get the full benefit of the heat of the sun.\n\nWill the school have a full sized basement? This would make for a more solid foundation. It should be of the floating basement type, that is with the reinforcing steel going down the sides & into the floor & the basement & floor being one solid unit. I don't think there'll be the solid rock under that location. There isn't here either but we think that we have got down to a solid base and that most depends on clearing & draining.\n\nMay I suggest that plans also be made for a new dock at the school to be put in as early as possible as water is very low & work would be easy. The present dock was pretty well demolished by high water.\n\nKindest regards. Sincerely yours,\n\nHoward B. Gibson\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gibson, 9 Feb 49.\n(b) Diagram \" \"\n(c) Tracing of T2132.\n\nOn T2132 I have shaded in red the site of the present school (old mission house) on church property. We could avoid having to buy this if our local officials would, when conditions permit, determine whether Mr. Goodman and I were right in supposing that we had located a site on Indian land (shown by a red X).\n\nI have made copies of Mr. Gibson's sketch also as it seems desirable that the agency assistant at God's Lake (Mr. Roy Bennett) should have a copy of everything, because he will have to decide whether to put the materials at the H.B. post or at the R.C. Mission (Wass Johnson).\n\nAs buildings of any sort at God's Lake are hard to come by I could wish that Mr. Gibson were not so keen on demolishing existing ones.\n\nPerhaps Mr. Bennett would recommend the area shaded in blue on T2132 and thus save:\n(a) the existing \"school\" for an \"overflow\" room\n(b) added difficulty of surveying the red area.\n\nC.A.V. Clark\nAIR MAIL\n\n28th February, 1949.\n\nMr. J.H. Staunton,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nIlford, Manitoba.\n\nRe: God's Lake United Church School\n\nWe have recently received a letter from Reverend Howard B. Gibson, United Church Missionary at God's Lake. Part of his letter reads as follows:\n\n\"Tractors are unable to get closer than to the Catholic Mission or to the Hudson's Bay Co. I will try to see Mr. Roy Bennett re his suggestions for the best possible placing of the materials. They could be moved here by bombardier from where the tractor leaves them or they could be moved by barge in the spring.\"\n\nBefore the supplies are shipped, you should decide on the site on which the supplies should be placed, so that they will be available for construction of the building when the weather conditions permit. Mr. Gibson considers that the present building should be demolished, and the new building erected on the same site. The former agent, Mr. Goodman, suggested a different site. For your information in this regard, I attach a rough sketch prepared by Mr. Clark of this Division.\n\nMr. Clark feels that as buildings at God's Lake of any sort are scarce, and as he understands that there is a continual demand for them, it would be unwise to demolish the present school, which may be used for some other purpose.\nHowever, as mentioned above, Mr. Gibson suggests that we demolish it. We are leaving the matter in your hands to decide what action is best to take in the matter.\n\nPP/3T Attech.\n\nBernard F.

Could you please advise me as to whether you wish to issue another purchase order regularizing this transfer.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMarch 3, 1949.\n\nColonel Neary:\n\nLanding dock at God's Lake Narrows:\n\nThis is a project concerning which our local officials could take action. No doubt Mr. Gibson will invite Mr. Sept. Staunton's attention to the present dilapidated one\u2014if it is visible under the snow and ice. But if you could get a letter to Mr. Staunton before he visits God's Lake it would likely be helpful in accelerating the job.\n\nGott Clark\nMarch 5, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Neary, Supt. of Education.\n\nReference your letter of 28 Feb., subject God's Lake United Church School, File 513-5 (MI).\n\nPlease be advised that all necessary arrangements have been made for the storing of the building material at a spot approximately 400 yds. from where the school will be erected.\n\nThere is a small building there belonging to the H.B. Company which they have kindly consented to allow us to use for the storage of cement.\n\nThis spot is on the other side of the Narrows, and it will be necessary to move the cement and material by barge across the 400 yd. stretch of water when the construction commences.\n\nIn this connection, we have a barge at God's Lake, which can be used for this purpose.\n\nAs regards the actual site of the school building, this will be erected approximately 75 yds. N.W. of the present school.\n\nI am quite in accordance with Mr. Clark's views that the old school should not be demolished.\n\nI see no point in tearing down a building that can be used for storage and any other need that might arise.\n\nIn this connection I might say that I have visited the proposed site twice by Bombardier during the past six weeks.\n\nOn the 22nd of Feb., I was discussing the site with Mr. Gibson and showed him the spot I proposed to erect the new school. He then suggested I have the old building demolished and build the new school on the same spot.\nTo this I could not agree as it entailed extra work to no purpose and also destroyed a building in a location where buildings are scarce.\n\nMr. Roy Bennett, Assistant Agent, is located at God's Lake, and I have instructed him to ensure the cement and material are properly stored when they arrive at God's Lake Narrows.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.H. Staunton,\nSupt., Nelson River Agency.\n\nJHS/AH\nc.c. R.S. Davis, Esq.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAttn. Mr. B. F. Neary\n\nI am submitting, herewith, a quotation received from Mr. E. Sabiston on building the God's Lake and Oxford House schools. This man worked with the Medical Branch last year and is a fairly good worker.\n\nMr. McRea, the man who built the school at Little Grand Rapids, will build the above mentioned schools on a day labour basis at $1.35 an hour, plus transportation and $1.75 a day, board allowance, per man, taking with him a couple of carpenters and hire Indian labour. If the men could go north just before break-up these schools could be started at once as we have no basements to build and the foundations could be built within a few weeks.\n\nWill you please advise what action I should take in this matter as I am anxious to get these schools underway as soon as possible. I might state I consider Mr. Sabiston's quotation rather high.\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nRSD/MO\nEnc.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. McRea's accounts for erecting a pre-fabricated shop at Little Grand Rapids were \"just under $4,000.\"\n\nBoard for 106 days (May 25 - Sept 7)\n@ $1.75 106 days\n\nHis wife worked as a painter\nShe drew board for 63 days @ $8\nPay for 54\"\n\nHe will need a bigger working force for this building.\n\nMr. Sabiston's tender for $6,000 seems to be all-inclusive, but mentions no time limit.\n\nThe Board has found that C.A.R.C. labour at Valley River came to at least $6,000.\n\n9/4/49\nApril 11, 1949.\n\nMr. R.S.

Indian Day School\nOxford House No. Indian Day School\nRef. your 206-4A of April 2\n\nWe have checked our files to ascertain the number of days for which we paid Mr. McRea in constructing the Little Grand Rapids School. In erecting a pre-fabricated building there, it took him 106 days. It will presumably take him just as long, if not longer, to erect these two schools, and he will probably need a larger working force. Therefore, there is every possibility that with a large daily labour bill, board bills and transportation expenses, his tender will exceed the $6,000.00 figure quoted by Mr. Sabiston.\n\nWill Mr. McRea submit a firm tender for the erection of this building? If not, then we feel that a time limit of 100 days should be placed on each of these projects, otherwise the Department will be paying a daily board and labour bill of about $50.00 a day while these carpenters take their time over completing the school.\n\nWould you please discuss both the firm tender figure and the time limit with Mr. McRea and advise us as soon as possible concerning the decision reached.\n\nBernard F.

The Department agrees with your recommendation concerning the old school. In several other instances we have let these old buildings stand and have used them for either storage purposes or have let Indians occupy them. If you have an old Indian couple in need of a house, you can arrange to let them use the old school and advise us accordingly. If you wish it used for administration purposes, you can do so, but the matter will be left in your hands for decision.\n\nBernard F.

I advised him that other tenders would have to be received. At the time I mentioned that I considered his tender a little high. As this was his first attempt at submitting a tender he advised he would recheck his figures. He resubmitted his tender at $5,000.00 each unit. I intended forwarding the new tender, with an explanation, when forwarding Mr. Matthews' tender from The Pas. This tender was noticed during my absence and Mr. Rayson thought it advisable to forward same immediately, therefore, the confusion.\n\nI expect to receive Mr. Matthews' tender tomorrow. I might state that Mr. Matthews has a couple of gangs working in the north for the Provincial Government at the present time.

Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nMr. Elmer Sabiston was employed during our construction work period last summer and fall. He worked at Nelson House both on the nursing station and the erection of your day school. Afterwards he was moved to several places west as far as Driftpile, Alta.\n\nAs a carpenter we found his work quite satisfactory and he is capable of being a very good tradesman. I do not have any information of value concerning his integrity as a contractor as he only worked for us on day labour for an hourly wage. However, he seemed capable of getting the natives to do a fair amount of work in a day. I think on a fixed price he would take necessary action to encourage active activity from the natives, because of his own interests.\n\nC.J.

(138) of April 22nd, I am enclosing herewith tenders on the building of the Oxford House School, God's Lake School, and Cedar Lake School. Mr. Sabiston has put in a tender, which you have received, for $6,000.00, but I am very doubtful if this man could complete the work for this amount - owing to the high cost of transportation for himself, his men, and his equipment; also, living conditions are a lot higher in the North. Mr. Sabiston called at the office last week and I requested him to give me some references so we would be in a position to judge if he was reliable or not. He promised to do so, but he has not called since. I would recommend that his tender not be considered.\n\nThe tenders from Emery Bros. are attached herewith, and are considerably higher than Matthews Construction Company. I would recommend giving this work to Matthews Construction Company, as they have three gangs working in this locality and are quite reliable to undertake this work. Will you please advise me as soon as possible, so I can get the work started and have it completed early in the season.\n\nIndian Affairs.

These materials went in by tractor train this winter and work can begin on the schools within another fortnight.\n\nThe materials for Chemawawin on Cedar Lake are being ordered now as they will be shipped by barge from The Pas when ice clears from these rivers.\n\nIn analyzing these tenders you will find the following figures:\n\n| CONTRACTOR     | God's Lake | Oxford House | Chemawawin |\n|----------------|------------|--------------|------------|\n| E. Sabiston    | $5,000.    | $6,000.      | $-         |\n| Matthews       | 5,900.     | 5,900.       | 5,900.     |\n| Emery Brothers | 6,800.     | 6,800.       | 6,400.     |\n\nIt would seem evident that we can eliminate the highest tenderer, Emery Brothers, immediately. However, there is some doubt as to whether we should accept Mr. Sabiston's or the Matthews Construction Company tenders for the God's Lake and Oxford House Schools. Mr. Sabiston is not recommended by Mr. Davis who states that when\nrequested to provide references, Mr. Sabiston did not return to the office as promised. I also attach a letter which I had Mr. Connelly, Supervising Engineer of Indian Health Services, prepare for me. Apparently he is a good carpenter but there is some question as to his integrity as a contractor.\n\nTherefore, I would suggest that we only hire him for the God's Lake School construction (this will require only Ministerial approval) and have prepared submissions to Council for the other two school contracts to be awarded to the Matthews Construction Company of The Pas, Manitoba. This company is a large one, has competent crews in the field, and has already been recommended for the construction of the Nelson House Indian Day School.\n\nI do not feel we could recommend the Matthews Company for all four schools, especially when the Sabiston tender is lower. Could I discuss this matter with you please.\n\nBernard F.

Indian Education,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a tender from Elmer Sabiston in connection with building the Oxford House and Gods Lake Indian Day Schools.\n\nMr. Sabiston has submitted a tender to do all the labour in connection with building these two schools, he has had experience in building in the north and I recommend his tender be accepted, and the work got under way as soon as possible. I am enclosing herewith a cheque for $1,000.00 which is 10% of his tender the same to be returned to him on completion of the school buildings.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. S. Davis,\nRegional Supervisor,\nIndian Agencies.\nOttawa, June 22, 1949.\n\nPRECIS FOR THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL:\n\nRequesting authority for the provision of one-room Indian Day Schools on the God's Lake Indian Reserve and on the Gaford House Indian Reserve, both in the Nelson River Indian Superintendency, in the Province of Manitoba, and for which funds are provided in the 1949-50 Estimates.\n\nTwo extra copies of Order-in-Council are required.\nJune 22, 1949.\n\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY\n\nTHE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL,\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report:\n\nThis is an immediately necessary, and funds are provided in the 1949-50 estimates, Vote 330, Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, to complete the erection of one-room Indian Day Schools on the God's Lake Indian Reserve and on the Oxford House Indian Reserve, both in the Nelson River Indian Superintendent in the Province of Manitoba;\n\nThat it is essential that educational facilities be provided for the Indian children on the God's Lake Reserve and on the Oxford House Reserve;\n\nThat Section 36 of the Public Works Act, Chapter 146, R.S.C., 1937, provides in part as follows:\n\n\"Whenever any works are to be executed under the direction of any Department of the Government the Minister having charge of such Department shall invite tenders by public advertisement for the execution of such works except in cases (a) of pressing emergency in which delay would be injurious to the public interest ..........\"\n\nThat the building materials for these schools have already been purchased and have been shipped by tractor trains to the sites of both schools;\n\nThat, due to the very isolated situation of both these Indian reserves, there are few builders or contractors in the area and civilian contractors are not interested in tenders if invited as advertised, as they have all the work they can do in their own localities;\n\nThat, as the result of enquiries made by our field officials, we have been able to obtain the following labour tenders for the erection of these buildings:\n\n| Contractor          | God's Lake | Oxford House |\n|--------------------|------------|--------------|\n| Einar Schistom, Winnipeg | $5,000.00  | $5,000.00    |\n| Matthews Construction Co., The Pas | $5,000.00  | $5,000.00    |\n| Henry Brothers, The Pas | $6,000.00  | $6,000.00    |\n\nThat the lowest tenderer, namely Einar Schistom, of Winnipeg, has produced evidence to the effect that he will\nbuild these schools in a satisfactory way. His tender covers all transportation and boarding costs and is felt to be fair and reasonable.\n\nThe undersigned, therefore, recommends that authority be granted for the erection of the God's Lake Indian Day School and the Oxford House Indian Day School by Mr. Elmer Asheton, of Winnipeg, Manitoba, at the price of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) for each project, this being the most suitable arrangement possible at the present time and it being essential that this work be undertaken at once and carried on to completion in order to provide educational facilities for the Indian children on these reserves in time for school opening in September.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\nOttawa, June 22, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nGopi's Lake Indian Day School, Oxford House Indian Day School,\nNelson River Indian Superintendency.\n\nThe above two schools are included in our building programme for 1949-50. It is our intention to follow the same plan for each school. Due to transportation difficulties in the summer, it was necessary to arrange to ship all building materials by tractor train during last winter to the two school sites.\n\nMr. Regional Supervisor Davis has been approaching contractors who specialize in construction work in Northern Manitoba. As a result, he has been able to obtain the following labour tenders for the construction of these two schools:\n\n| Contractor                  | Gopi's Lake | Oxford House |\n|----------------------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Elmer Sebastion, Winnipeg, Man. | $5,000.00   | $5,000.00    |\n| Matthews Construction Co., The Pas, | 5,900.00    | 5,900.00     |\n| Emery Brothers, Flin Flon, Man. | 6,800.00    | 6,800.00     |\n\nI have therefore prepared a Memorandum to Council recommending the acceptance of Mr. Sebastion's tender. At first there was some doubt in the mind of our Regional Supervisor as to the financial ability of Mr. Sebastion to carry out both these projects. However, the Superintendent of Education has recently discussed this\nmatter by long distance with Mr. Davis and is assured that Mr. Sabiston now has the necessary funds. In fact he has forwarded a security deposit cheque in the amount of $1,000.00.\n\nI would therefore recommend the forwarding of this submission to the Clerk of the Privy Council.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nJune 22, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nOxford House Indian Day School\nGod's Lake U.C. Indian Day School\n\nPlease find attached certified cheque for $1,000.00 submitted by Mr. Elmer Sabiston as a security deposit accompanying his tender for $10,000.00 for the erection of the above two schools on a labour basis. Please deposit this cheque pending the passing of an Order-in-Council and the completion of the projects.\n\nBernard P. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\n\nIndian Affairs.

In order to eliminate the necessity of having two contracts, you will note that I have consolidated both projects into the one form. Please have Mr. Sabinson sign the three copies and return them here for signature by the Deputy Minister. Two copies will then be returned to you, one for Mr. Stanton's file and one for the contractor.\n\nProgress Payments:\nPlease note particularly article 3 (b) detailing the payment of progress claims. A separate claim will have to be made on each project even though the contract covers both schools. If you wish me to send two $5,000.00 accountable advances to Mr.\nStaunton I will so arrange. You will recall the delays at Peguis No. 1 last year with the payment of these progress claims. It would be even more difficult at Nelson River to arrange the sending of the money to Mr. Sabiston and I think it could best be handled by our local Superintendent.\n\nI am attaching a number of these progress payment forms and an extra copy of my letter so that both can be sent to Mr. Staunton with your additional instructions. The authority to be quoted on the form is P.O. 3392 of July 6, 1949, and separate claims must be submitted for each project.\n\nYou can notify the non-successful tenderers of the acceptance of Mr. Sabiston's bid, which was the lowest submitted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard P.

Clark,\nEducational Survey Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Clark:\n\nWe are disturbed at the suggestions that the new United Church School be moved off the Reserve. Mr. Roy Bennett, Assistant Indian Agent, intimated that the present school location was unsuitable, because of lack of solid bottom, to hold the new building. He dug two holes. He said he came to stones & water on the school property. At the location he has proposed between the Hudson's Bay Co. & the freetrader's property (Mr. Tom Rumlinski) he said he came to bed-rock. The Chief & Councillors asked permission yesterday to dig a hole on the school property. They wanted to see the nature of the soil as Mr. Bennett had filled in his hole. They dug about 50 feet west of Mr. Bennett's hole exactly on the spot that Mr. Staunton had said the school should be put. In digging down five feet they encountered heavy clay, a mixture of clay & sand & finally rocks & hard clay. They struck no moisture whatsoever. This merely proved that there is the solid bottom that we have maintained was there.\n\nMr. Bennett said that our new foundation for our house had spoiled this location for the new school. Let me point out two things about our house foundation: 1. We are on the slope of the hill & have experienced the same trouble as the builders had when making the new house for the Principal of Brandon Residential School. Our solution will be the same as theirs, to drain off the water which, coming downhill, has weakened the foundation. 2. The water may not have affected our foundation if we had had time last fall to move the house & thus not leave the foundation open & exposed to frost. The frost cracked it first & weakened it.\nThe location of the school is much different from here. It is at the top of the hill, not on the slope as we are. There is good drainage on all sides. I would suggest that if there is any doubt about this location, Mr. Glass, the district supervisor of trading posts for the Hudson's Bay Co., should be consulted. He is in charge of locating their buildings. The Hudson's Bay Co. built a new store & warehouse on their property here at the Narrows last summer. Their other building stood for 50 years. They built on similar soil to here, on the hillsides too, and not on the bedrock nearby where it is now suggested that our new school be placed. Our present school building has stood for at least 30 years & is quite solid though of hem logs. I trust that this explanation clears up any doubt that there may be for the suitability of the present school location.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.) Howard B.

The reason why I wired you in July re it being moved off the Reserve is that Ray Bennett, the Assistant Indian Agent let out a contract for hauling sand to a new site on the island next to the Hudson's Bay Co. Besides being off our property this site is absurd in that the school children would have to all cross over around the weak ice of the Narrows. In the Spring & Fall the Indian Dept. would have to provide a boat for the children to cross on. There is no room for a playground and the H.B.C. clerk says they'll be around his store bothering him all the time. Our property is in the centre of community and beside the Narrows where all boats pass in the Summer and beside the portage trail where all dog teams must travel in the winter. Mr. Davis from Winnipeg and Mr. Staunton the Indian Superintendent from Ilford are to be here shortly and we'll make all arrangements when they arrive. Our present site is best in every respect and we don't want the school moved.\nAIR MAIL\n\nAugust 29, 1949\n\nMr. R.S.

School\n\nReference is to my letter, this file, dated July 26.\n\nUnder date of August 15th the missionary, Rev. Mr. Gibson, has written to Dr. Dorey of the United Church Board of Home Missions that arrangements are being made to erect the new building across the water from the former site.\n\nFrom other information available here it seems that there are several valid objections to this site.\n\nThis school, as you know, has long had a denominational connection. The Roman Catholic members of the band have a school of their own too. The manner in which the school at the Mine is conducted must not influence Mr. Bennett's handling of the school in question.\n\nAs Dr. Dorey will be in Ottawa this week, your report of the situation as it now stands should reach this office before his arrival.\n\nBernard F.

School\n\nFurther reference to your letter of August 29, 1949, file No. 513-5 (E3), I recently returned from God's Lake and while there inspected the site of the above mentioned school. I had the Indians dig down seven feet and found nothing but bog - certainly not fit to build a school on. I located a site on a hill about seventy-five yards north. This site is still on the United Church property and was satisfactory to all. I would like to point out that Mr. Bennett was quite right when he reported that the site was not satisfactory.\n\nRegarding the third paragraph of your letter, please be advised that the manner in which the school at the Mine is conducted has not influenced Mr. Bennett's handling of the school in question.\n\nI would like to mention that Rev. Gibson at God's Lake very often interferes with Department business. He also advises the Indians to the effect that they should receive assistance from the Department free of charge. When Dr. Dorey is in Ottawa I would appreciate it if you would mention the above to him and request Dr. Dorey to write to Rev. Gibson advising him to attend to his own affairs in future.\n\nI had a talk with Rev. Gibson while at God's Lake and advised him that if he continued to act as he had in the past that I would ask the Department to have him moved.\n\nR. S.

There is a great misfortune as under Mr. B. Ritchard the school at Grand Rapids was an open air day school in existence.\n\nYours sincerely,\n[Signature]\n[Place]\n[Date]\ncondition, I proceeded to the Chief's and made an investigation. It appears that Councillor Atkinson had attempted to bar up the windows to prevent further damage, but he himself had allowed Isaac Scott to take over the store until warm weather should set in. I consider that if he may not be deprived of such conduct, as \"incompetent,\" he should be severely reprimanded. The other Councillor John Turner had appropriated the store and, I am told, used them for dancing purposes. I beg to report that not only on account of this shameful conduct, but in other respects also, John Turner is of no use to the Band as a headman. When once the school had been broken open, numbers of children had free access, and appropriated books etc.\n\nI beg further to report that on the authority of your letter of 3rd June last, I asked Abraham Scott (who is about the best Indian of the Band) to assist the Chief during the latter's incapacity owing to blindness, but subject to your approval and the confirmation of the Department. I gave instructions to have store and all stolen property forthwith replaced, and I am pleased to be able to say that Abraham Scott has since been round the Reserve & obtained the store and numbers of other things, and has secured...\nsecured them in the School house.\n\nBut there are many books etc., which it will be impossible to recover.\n\nIf Abraham Scott's appointment be approved & confirmed, I beg respectfully to suggest that he may receive some recognition of his services, say an addition of $10 per annum to his Treaty Money.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file S14-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward herewith enclosed report that on the occasion of my visit to Grand Rapids Reserve in February last I found that the School House had been broken into, and nearly all Government Property (including Furniture, stove, books etc.) had been taken away. The 2 tables however had been previously borrowed by the missionary last summer. After taking an inventory in July last, I locked the door, but this has been broken open and many of the windows have been ruthlessly stoned & broken with sticks. I am not aware if any of this robbery had been perpetrated at the time of your inspection in August last. The Indians had happily been stored at the H.P. Co.\n\nOn finding things in such a deplorable condition\n\nE.M. Roll Esq.\nInspector of Indian Affairs\nWinnipeg\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 514-1, part 1)\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter dated the 18th of March last, from Mr. Indian Agent Reader reporting that on his visit to Grand Rapids Reserve in February last that he found the school house there had been broken into, and that nearly all the Government property had been abstracted therefrom; that two tables had been borrowed by the missionary last summer, but by whose authority he does not know.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 514-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nnot state. During my inspection of the reserve in August last there was an school in operation, as the former teacher Mr. Richard resigned and the door and windows of the schoolhouse were broken. I wrote to Mr. Brown to supply another teacher but it appears that owing to the actions of the council none was employed.\n\nWith regard to Councillors Atkinson and Turner, I would recommend that they both be dismissed from their positions not for \"incompetency\" but for dishonesty and that only one Councilor be appointed in their place viz Abraham Scott who is an Indian above the ordinary intelligence, and that the amenities of the other...\nother Commissioners at the next\nmeeting be given to Abraham\nScotts for attending to this duty,\nwhich they should have looked\nafter, and that the amenities\nof all parties concerned in\nthe destruction of windows\nboards and so forth be re-\nturned to Abraham Scotts\nfor if such actions go un-\nwhipped of justice others will\nin all probability come\nwith similar offenses, and\nwhosoever breaks the\nplates to the missionary\nand I do not know\nwho would do so but\nthe agent himself should\nbe severely reprehended\nand made to have them\nreturned, and if any of\nthem are broken, he should\nbe compelled to replace\nthem at his own exp-\nense.\nI have the honor\nto be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n[Signature]\n9, J. A.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant enclosing a communication from Mr Agent Bender reporting that on his visit to the Grand Rapids Reserve in February last he found that the school-house had been broken into and nearly all the Government property abstracted therefrom; and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your recommendation to have Councillors Atkinson and Turner deposed for their action in connection with this matter and Abraham Scott appointed to act in their place. The saving inquiry will, it is thought, cover the cost of the property destroyed.\n\nEXAMINED\n\nSCHOOL BRANCH.\n\n[Handwritten note]\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Supt Genl:\nof Indian Affairs:\n\nH.

During Sept. (for which term no returns were sent in by Mr. Prichard) 1375 lbs. were received, and 71 lbs. 17 oz. issued, leaving a balance on hand of 1846 lbs. 10 oz.\n\nAt the Annuity Payments in 1895 I found 1725 lbs. in apparent good condition, and about 30 lbs. in the School spoiled, showing that there was a deficiency of 90 lbs. 10 oz. This amount was in all probability stolen, so the school had been broken into during the interim. In the fall of 1895, I had 375 lbs. transferred to the Pas Moutain School, none having been sent there that summer. This left a balance of 1360 lbs. the amount on hand at the beginning of Dec.

The children were very wild and ignorant, the school having been closed for nearly three years. The discipline is much better now than at the commencement of the quarter and the progress of the children is apparent.\n\nThe school was closed on Nov. 20, as I had to go to the Horse Island for beef. The school was closed from the 14th of December to the end of the quarter as I had completed the requisite number of school days.\n\nThe school was open from 9 a.m. to 12 and from 1 p.m. to 3.\n\nMost of the children live at the far end of the Reserve from the school, and in closing at 3 p.m. I followed the precedent which obtained at The Pas last winter.\n\nJ.H.

As I enclose hereunder the Remarks which the Teacher omitted to make in his Return, and which the Agent requested him to furnish for the information of the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Department of the\n\nSup. Surgeon of\n\nIndian Affairs,\n\nOttawa,\n\nOntario.\nSir,\n\nIf the Department has not been previously notified I beg now to inform you that Solomon Butler is giving up the charge of the school at Grand Rapids, in the Pas agency at the close of this current quarter, and I would ask the Department to sanction the appointment of the Rev. Albert Fraser as teacher of the school. Mr. Fraser is at present missionary in charge of Grand Rapids and he is thoroughly competent to undertake the duties of the school.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. MacKay\nOttawa, July 10, 2009.\n\nVery Rev. Sirs\u2014\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 28th ult., I beg to say that, in the event of the transfer of Mr. Solomon Buller from the Grand Rapids to the Sham Lake school, the Rev. Albert Fraser may be appointed teacher of the former school.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J.A. MacKay,\nBattleford, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have given above my usual address; but I am really writing from Grand Rapids, Man.\n\nI sent you word either by my own writing, or by that of Mr. Archibald MacKay that Solomon Butler had left his position as teacher here, so that I desired the appointment of Rev. Mr. Fraser in his place. I find on reaching this place that Mr. Fraser has been teaching steadily since July 1st, but that he has not been notified by your Dept. of his appointment. I should be glad if you would kindly notify him, & send him any instructions that you may desire. I do not know if you can also make him dispenser of medicines & rations, &c., with the usual salary payment for that; but it would be desirable. He lives among his Indians, & is very capable; while all others live the other side of the river, & are quiet at Norway House. I have visited the school, & inspected his Registry, & find he is doing all that can be done. The numbers attending are small, but so many are constantly away & can not attend.\n\nThere is no work now at Grand Rapids, & many go away to Chetawaway & other places to hunt, fish, or make a living. I think many will be away this next winter. He is diligent.\nBut unless there is some great change here, that is unless the lake trout fishing revives, and the Indians are used for it, there will soon be few Indians here. There is no way for them to make a living. They might indeed grow potatoes, keep cattle, and do this for small salaries; but it seems impossible to teach them to do so.\n\nI think that the Indian Agent might do a little more in this direction if he were really interested in his work. But my chief object in writing was to ask you to notify Mr. Fraser of his appointment as teacher, and if possible to appoint him to distribute rations, medicines, etc. I believe the Indians are deprived by the Agent in a large way of their rights or are torn away. If they could be distributed by some authority, upon condition of the Indians doing their duty as to wood for the school, it would be better. As it is there is often little or no wood for the school, and the school has been closed for want of fire. The Indians are supposed to find all the school wood. Mr. Fraser will enclose a note by you authorizing you to pay his expenses to me at Prince Albert as far more convenient for him.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. H. Saskatchewan\nOttawa, October 4, 1909.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 11th ult., and in reply I beg to say that on July 16, last, the Department in a letter written to Ven. Archdeacon MacKay approved of the appointment of Rev. Mr. Fraser as teacher of the Grand Rapids day school, and a recent letter to himself with reference to the payment of his salary virtually confirms the appointment.\n\nArrangements have already been made by the Agent for the distribution of supplies, etc. at this point for this year; Your Lordship's request in this respect cannot, therefore, be complied with.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\nyour obedient Servant,\n\nRight Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6235, file 514-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nI believe I notified you of a coming change in the School at Grand Rapids; but in any case I desire to do so now in detail.\n\nI found it necessary to move Rev. A. Baser from Grand Rapids to The Pas, & that meant a change in the Jr. Rap. School. I desire to nominate Mr. C. W. Morris for the appointment, to begin as early as he can get there in May. Mr. Morris is an Englishman who has been attending our College for two years, though he has had no special training as a teacher. He hopes eventually to become a missionary to the Cree Indians, & he takes an interest in them.\n\nI trust the J. D. will confirm this appointment. There are few Indians now at Grand Rapids, & getting fewer yearly. If there is any further work (or pay) such as sewing, tailoring or medicines, etc., I shall be glad if it can be assigned to the teacher, Mr. Morris.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 514-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nAs Mr. Morris can not reach Gr. Rapids till late in May, as Mr. Fraser has to leave the middle of this month (March), he has arranged for Mr. John Henry Turner to carry on the school meantime. He is a native resident of Gr. Rapids, & I think capable of the work. Mr. Fraser writes \"he is a very reliable young man, & highly thought of by everyone who knows him.\" The school register is only 14 boys & girls now, & some of them are sure to be away next month, the rat-hunting month.\n\nI shall be glad if the S.D. will sanction these two appointments, & should be glad to satisfy myself that I may tell the two men, Morris & Turner. If you have any directions, instructions, questions, for either or both of them I shall be glad to pass them on. Mr. C.W. Morris is at Emmanuel College, Nutana, Sask.; Mr. John Henry Turner is at Grand Rapids.\n\nThey remain\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.H. Saskatchewan\nOttawa, March 18th, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 7th instant, in which you state that the Rev. A. Fraser has been transferred from Grand Rapids to The Pas, and that the position is being temporarily filled by Mr. John Henry Turner pending the arrival of Mr. C. W. Morris, whom you nominated for the position at Grand Rapids.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform Your Lordship that the temporary engagement of Mr. Turner and the appointment of Mr. Morris are approved, and the Department trusts that the latter will be able to produce good results at this school. As Your Lordship was informed in October, last, arrangements have been made by the Agent for the distribution of supplies, etc., at Grand Rapids for this year, but, should any change be made, your application on behalf of Mr. Morris will be kept in mind.\n\nBe good enough to advise the Department when Mr. Morris leaves for Grand Rapids.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\nRight Rev.

Please find and inclu School report for the Month of March.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJohn Henry Turner\nRev John Semmes\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nWinnipeg\nSir,\n\nIn forwarding the report of the Grand Rapids Day School, Church of England, I find that the Rev. Mr. Fraser, formerly in charge of this school has left the Settlement and placed Mr. Turner in charge in his place. I have no advice as to whether this change has been sanctioned by the Department or not. This will be known at headquarters. It is rather irregular for one school teacher to appoint another.\n\nI am also in receipt of a letter from Arthur Santmier who claims to be in charge of the Hollow Water River School under direction of Bishop Lofthouse of Kenora. I have no advice on file showing that Miss Ross who was in charge of this school up to the time of Mr. Santmier's arrival there has been dismissed, nor have I any word of Mr. Santmier's appointment in her place, although in a former letter, I recommended that a change be made.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from the Department what is the status of Mr. Turner and of Mr. Santmier. I enclose Mr.\nSantmier's letter, and also a letter from Mr. Turner bearing upon the cases cited.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, October 1, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, and in reply to that portion in which you deal with the appointment of a teacher to the Grand Rapids day school I beg to say that the Department approved the temporary appointment of Mr. John Henry Turner, pending the arrival of Mr. G. W. Morris, who was nominated by the Bishop of Saskatchewan for the position. His Lordship will now be communicated with.\n\nEvidently the March quarter return for this school lay in your office since the month of April. It is considered that you should make some arrangement to have correspondence of this kind forwarded during your absence. In any event these returns should come through the local Indian Agent and not through your office.

It was not intended that the returns from the schools in the southern part of the Norway House Agency should be forwarded through Mr. Calverley's office; at the same time you should note the remarks with reference to the forwarding of returns, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

I can only think that he do not understand the date for return.\n\nI am writing him at once to make a send them; but a letter of instructions from yr. Office might help matters.\n\nRegretting the silence & delay,\n\nI remain\n\nin faithfully,\n\nJ.H.

As yet no returns have been received and the Department communicated with His Lordship and obtained the above information.\n\nTeachers of Indian schools are expected to send in returns quarterly on forms provided for the purpose and payment of the salary is made upon the receipt of these returns. I am sending you, under separate cover, a supply of forms and you will be good enough to fill in one for each of the quarters ending June 30th and September 30th. Full instructions for making out these returns are given on the back. When completed they should be forwarded to Rev. J. Semmens, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Winnipeg, who will transmit them to the Department, when payment of the salary due you for the time you were in charge during the two quarters will be made.

It has been some years since I have met her.\n\nIn regard to the Church of England appointing a teacher, I have no information.

As it is my daughter's home and as she is a great comfort to her mother, I do not like to see her leave home.\n\nIf you look up your reports from here, you will see \"No school, Church work.\" You will also find that the children cannot speak English, why? for the simple reason that it is church first.\n\nI know that the children do better with a lady teacher. If you look at your reports you will find more children attending than heretofore.\n\nThe last teacher Mr. N. Settee, whom the church sent, spoke Cree all the time, so what could you expect?\n\nSend a returned soldier and I will not kick, but welcome him.\n\nI am official trustee for Grand Rapids School No. 1560 and we do not employ a man especially in war time.\nTrusting that you will give this matter your kind attention at once, I beg to remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ Morrison MPP\nOttawa, July 27, 1917.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nIn reference to official letter of the 21st of May, last, in which Your Lordship was advised that the Department had appointed Mr. Gelling as teacher of the Grand Rapids Indian School I beg to enclose herewith a copy of a communication which the Department has received in regard to this matter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Morrison M.P.\n\nI fail to see why you sent his letter (copy) to me. I think you can easily deal with the man. I certainly shall not answer it to him. He is evidently sure that he could not secure the post of teacher for his daughter.\n\nI need not enter into a long defense of my action, nor of the connexion between Church & Schools. The I.D. has always entrusted this work to the Churches, & if the Churches had not provided teachers the Indians would have had little education.\n\nHis charge that we neglect education for what he calls \"Church work\" is utterly false. Mr. Gelling can not teach in Cree! Nathan Mette was practically a Cree, but a fair English scholar. I quite agree with the rule that all able-bodied young men should go to the front if possible. But any child can see that we can not spare all the men. If Mr. Gelling is selected for active service, or voluntarily enlists, I shall find another teacher. It is a matter also of wise economy. You can not pay a teacher highly; I can not afford a missionary. Between us we can support a man. School is not run in order that a daughter may remain at home!\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.H.

Archdeacon MacKay, at Prince Albert, concerning the splendid services, not only as teacher, but as missionary, of Mrs. Kate Leclair at the Mistawasis Indian Day School, near Leask, Sask. Mrs. Leclair is of Church of England faith and is doing genuine missionary work on the Mistawasis reserve, and at the time of my visit there this summer, she informed me that she had received no recognition from the Missionary Board of Canada or the Dominion Education Commission concerning conditions at the Fishing Lake reserve, which I now acknowledge, leads me to believe that I should address the Synod Office at Prince Albert, concerning Mrs. Leclair.\n\nI am asking you to refer to the proper authority, information that the Department has concerning the Rev. J. B. Butcher, Superintendent of the Church of England Indian Day School at Grand Rapids, Lake Winnipeg. It has come to our attention that Mr. Butcher is not particularly efficient in his efforts as teacher at this point. The arrangement with him was that his wife, who is properly qualified, should do the teaching; but I have fairly authentic information that she is leaving the work almost entirely to her husband. She has been a good attendant at this school. The Chief of the band is interested in education, but it appears that, due to irregularity of instruction, our work is receiving a set-back. Our Agent in the field is not particularly impressed with the work that Rev. Butcher has been doing as teacher. I am writing to Mr. Agent Latulippe of Sourkirk, Man., requesting him to do whatever he can to help him, and his wife, in his work.

J.L. Butcher, Teacher of the Church of England Indian Day School at Grand Rapids, Lake Winnipeg, and to state that I am forwarding a copy of the same to the Ven.

(RG 10, Volume 6235, file 514-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received from Dr Westgate a copy of your letter addressed to him, No.125-11-1 of the 9th unit, referring to the day-school at Grand Rapids, and expressing dissatisfaction with the work of Mr. J. L. Butcher, the teacher. I am writing now to say that I am doing what I can to bring about a better state of things there, but Grand Rapids is so remote and communication therewith so difficult and infrequent, that it takes time and effort to effect improvement even when it is clearly necessary.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. A. MacKay\n\nH. T. Perrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFrom: The Chief and Counsellor,\nIndian Reserve,\nGrand Rapids.\n\nTo: H. Latahif, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWest Selkirk.\n\nSir,\n\nAt the request of the members of this Reserve, and after consultation with my counsellor, I beg respectfully to request that you will consider the advisability of immediately removing the lay reader who at present functions as missionary to this Reserve.\n\nTo put it mildly, Mr. Butten's conduct betrays the utter lack of those outward signs which signify the \"inner grace\" that usually inspires a\nminister of the Gospel.\n\nFar from discharging any of the duties incumbent upon a missionary, he strives to render his every act and utterance entirely un-Christian and un-British.\n\nHis sermons are merely graphic descriptions of his own self-imagined qualifications and virtues, and his general attitude is that of some wonderful constellation whose rays have, for a moment, condescended to illumine the benighted lives of the untutored Indians (to whom he refers as \"niggers\").\n\nYet he is the quintessence of ignorance. His mind is so completely occupied by his pomposity and conceit that there is no room left for anything else.\nTo convey a comprehensive idea of Mr. Butler's character would entail the enumeration of so many acts and omissions that the recital would tire your patience, and even then the impression would not be so accurate or convincing as you could obtain from a few minutes' study of the man himself.\n\nIt is also difficult to embody in any specific charge the many acts and peculiarities of character which have made Mr. Butler's presence at Grand Rapids undesirable as a missionary, a resident, or in any capacity at all.\n\nBut in order that an investigation may be made I will state one or two facts.\nthe examination of which will elicit such additional information as will convince you of the necessity of dealing with Mrs. Butcher's services immediately.\n\nMrs. Butcher is the official school teacher appointed by the Indian Department. She kept school three times only during the first half of the year, and has not held any session at all since Treaty Day. Mrs. Butcher occasionally attends school, but it is usually only to distribute biscuits.\n\n2. Notwithstanding the generous supply given by the Department, Mrs. Butcher not only refuses to visit the sick and personally to\nattend to their complaints, but he declines even to issue medicines at all. This customary reply to a request for medical attention is that the medicines are supplied \"not for you niggers,\" but for the exclusive use of Mr. Butcher and his family.\n\n3. Charitable gifts, sent for distribution to the Indians, are sold by Mr. Butcher.\n\n4. His attitude to the Indians is insulting, abusive and altogether intolerable. None of the white people will have anything at all to do with him.\n\nSince Mr. Butcher owes his appointment to the\nchurch, a report has been made to the Bishop of Sacramento, asking for his removal.\n\nBut as the Indian Department is our legal protector, we appeal to you to use your power and remove this man, so send us someone who will be a help and a friend.\n\nWe would be grateful if you would arrange for this case to be seen into. A written request was Butten for an explanation would be no use, for his plausible hypocrisy would confound the Recording Angel.\nPerhaps it would be possible for you to arrange for someone to be sent down from the Bar to investigate. This work might be undertaken by the police, acting on behalf of the Department. The police are due to pay us a visit, Inspector Bates would no doubt be willing to make a report.\n\nWe are, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servants,\n\nOn behalf of the Counsellors and Band.\n\nChief Turner\nDonald Ballantyne\nChief\n\nGrand Rapids,\nJanuary 1, 1922\nSir,\n\nEnclosed please find Grand Rapide Indian Day School quarterly return ending December 31st, 1921, also a letter received from the Chief and Council of the Band in reference to the school teaching. Mrs. Butcher is the appointed teacher for this school by the Department and I am informed that she is substituted by her husband without the authority of the Department. I regret to say that Mr. Butcher does not give satisfaction as teacher, to my judgment this man is weak in intellect and no doubt has no knowledge of handling the Indians.\n\nReferring to your letter of December 9th last I beg to say that it has always been my ambition to assist the school teachers of this Agency. I wish to point out that the Grand Rapide Reserve is situated out of the way and only visited by me at the Annuity payment, which is generally in the month of August.\n\nI would be very thankful to receive further instructions in regard to this matter.\n\nRussell T. Perrier\nSupt. of Indian Education\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 514-1, part 1)\nOttawa, January 30, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 20th instant, concerning the unsatisfactory services of Mr. and Mrs. J. L. Butcher of the Grand Rapids Indian Day School. I have read your letter and the enclosed request of the Indian band, and have carefully noted the contents.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that I have written to Archdeacon Mackay of the Church of England, and he promised to give the matter of a successor his careful attention. I will address another communication to the Church authorities and explain that the Indian council has made a complaint concerning Mr. Butcher and his wife, and urge upon them the advisability of early action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nH. O. Latulippe, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\nOttawa, January 30, 1922.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 16th instant, referring to your effort to arrange for more satisfactory work at the Indian day school at Grand Rapids, Lake Winnipeg district.\n\nI have to inform you that the Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Agent Latulippe, of Selkirk, Man., enclosing a resolution of the Indian council at Grand Rapids. This letter and the resolution both strongly urge upon the Department the necessity of having Mr. Butcher and his wife replaced by more competent workers. Our Agent states \"that Mr. Butcher does not give satisfaction as Teacher and, to my judgment, this man is weak in intellect and no doubt has no knowledge of handling the Indians\".\n\nAs you are aware, Mrs. Butcher was engaged to do the teaching and, in view of the unsatisfactory work that they are performing, I wish to urge again upon the Church authorities the advisability of making a change at Grand Rapids as soon as is convenient.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nVery Rev. J. A. Mackay,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 125-11-1, of the 39th ult., urging the advisability of a change at Grand Rapids school, I beg to inform you that I have advised Mr. Butcher to resign the appointment of school teacher as soon as convenient, suggesting the end of the current quarter as a suitable time, and we will endeavour to find another teacher for the Indian day school at Grand Rapids as soon as possible.\n\nYou, however, I have no doubt, fully understand the difficulty of finding really suitable workers for a post like Grand Rapids.\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. MacKay\n\nRussell T. Ferrier Esq.\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 28, 1922.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 22nd instant, referring to the change of teachers at the Grand Rapids Indian Day School. The Department is pleased to learn that you have arranged for the resignation of Mr. and Mrs. J. L. Butcher.\n\nI am aware of the difficulty of finding suitable workers for a post of this kind; however, the Department trusts that you will be successful in having a successor to Mr. Butcher on the ground, so that there will be no interruption in the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. Mackay,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nMarch 28th, 1922.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nAs reported to you in my letter of the 22nd ult., I advised Mr. Butcher to resign the position of school teacher at Grand Rapids, suggesting the end of the current quarter, and suitable time for his resignation to take effect. I have now received a reply from Mr. Butcher in which he states that Mrs. Butcher (who really was engaged as teacher) has sent in her resignation to the Department, to take effect at the end of June quarter. I understand he has postponed his leaving in order to wait for the facility of steamboat navigation on Lake Winnipeg. As Grand Rapids is a very inconvenient place to get in and out of by any other way, it is easy to understand Mr. Butcher's preference for this arrangement.\n\nIn this connection, I have not been able yet to find a suitable teacher to take up the work at Grand Rapids, and I have thought of Mr. Gentleman, at present Principal of the Indian Boarding School at the Blackfoot Reserve near Calgary. He was for some years teacher of the improved day school on John Smith's Reserve, near Prince Albert, and I think his work was generally satisfactory. The cause of his leaving that post had, I understand, nothing to do with his efficiency as teacher. I understand he is likely to be superseded in his post as Principal of the Blackfoot School, and, if the Department approves, I would write to him and ascertain if he is disposed to take up the work at Grand Rapids. I may mention that Mrs. Gentleman is a most estimable lady, a gentlewoman in every sense of the word.\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours obediently\n\nJ. A. MacKay\n\nRussell T. Ferrier Esq.\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa\nOttawa, April 3, 1922.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have yours of the 28th ultimo, referring to the resignation of Mr. and Mrs. Butcher of Grand Rapids. It will be quite in order for them to continue their activities until the end of the June quarter and, as intimated before, the Department trusts that you will be successful in having a successor appointed in the near future.\n\nI might state that I am personally acquainted with Mr. Gentleman, of the Old Sun's Boarding School on the Blackfoot reserve and, as he is distinctly a classroom man himself, this Department would most certainly approve of his appointment to the day school at Grand Rapids. I was unaware that Dr. Westgate, or any other official, had made arrangements for Mr. Gentleman's resignation from his present position. However, if he is free to accept your offer, his appointment will be pleasing to this Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. Mackay,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter No. 125-11-1, of the 3rd inst., approving of the appointment of Mr. Gentleman to the Grand Rapids Day School, I beg to say that I am offering Mr. Gentleman the school, and I shall be glad if you will kindly inform me what salary the Department will allow.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Gentleman's resignation from his present position, he has informed me, that Dr. Gould has notified him, that his services will not be required after the end of June. In answer to an enquiry, Dr. Westgate informed me, under date of the 15th of April, that Mr. Gentleman's services will be dispensed with on June 30th next. He did not give me any reason for Mr. Gentleman's dismissal, and approved of his being offered the position of teacher of the Grand Rapids' Day School.\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. Mackay\n\nRussell T. Ferrier Esq.\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 6, 1922.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have yours of the 28th ultimo, referring to the vacancy at the Grand Rapids Indian Day School. I have noted that you are offering this position to Mr. Gentleman, late of the Old Sun's School.\n\nIn reply to your query concerning salary, I beg to state that the Department will allow $550 per annum plus whatever bonus is allowed by law.\n\nIf you are able to make definite arrangements with Mr. Gentleman, we will be pleased to have information to that effect. The Department is not prepared to offer the above mentioned salary to a teacher who possesses less qualifications than Mr. Gentleman.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. A. MacKay,\nSynod Office,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDear Mr. Ferrier;\n\nI must thank you for your letter of the 6th inst., referring to Grand Rapids, Manitoba.\n\nArchdeacon McKay also writes, but he has not given me any information, regarding the house, number of children, or salary. I am writing to him today to get this. It would cost us upward of $200 to move there and we do not wish to spend out so much, unless the Archdeacon can assure us that we would be acceptable to the people.\n\nWe would have rather moved in the other direction, but if conditions, I mean the house, at Grand Rapids is alright we will go.\n\nIt is really very good of you to talk with Dr Scott on our behalf, and in permitting us to take a day school I would like to say that Mrs Gentleman and myself will give every care and attention to the children we may come in contact with.\n\nAs soon as I hear from Archdeacon McKay I will write and let you know if we can accept.\n\nYour letter is encouraging, and thanking you again,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nR.T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 514-1, part 1)\nOttawa, May 20, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have yours of the 11th instant, inquiring re conditions at the Grand Rapids Indian Day School, in the Lake Winnipeg district.\n\nIn reply I beg to state our records show that there is a mission house 1\u00bd miles from the school. The school building was built 30 years ago and is in need of a few repairs at this time. The number of children enrolled is 22, the average attendance for last year, 14.8.\n\nThis cause at Grand Rapids is rather a pioneer one and there is a great work to be done. The parents do not show much interest in the education of their children and the church was unfortunate in its choice of a missionary teacher at this point, of late. As you are aware, in winter you reach Grand Rapids via The Pas and in the summer via Selkirk. The Pas is 125 miles away, and is the nearest telegraph, express and freight office. The steambot lands in the summer right at Grand Rapids. There is a postoffice one mile away.\n\nI trust this information will be of assistance to you as you make your decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nPrincipal,\nOld Sun's Boarding School,\nGleichen, Alta.\nOld Sun School., Gleichen, Alta. May 23rd, 1922.\n\nR.T.Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr Ferrier;-\n\nWith reference to the Grand Rapids school, I hear from Rev Archdeacon Mackay that no mid-day meal is served for the children; no field matron work is done, that the mission house used by the teacher is two miles from the school and that the salary is $850 per year and any bonus allowed by law & the nearest town is the Pas.\n\nI am writing the Archdeacon telling him that we would be glad to take the position.\n\nI also am told by a Missionary who spent some years at the Pas about 20 years ago, that the house is small and about 25 years old. We do not mind how small it is, but the fact that it is so far from the school would I should think be somewhat of a drawback. It means a cold schoolroom in the winter, and ones school garden neglected in the summer. This matter seems to me to be the only drawback, but of course it may be on account of some local condition. There is also a half-breed settlement on the other side of the river.\n\nThis half-breed settlement, of course, would have nothing to do with the Indian Department, but I expect that there will not be a provincial school for their use. As a rule half-breed school districts are in difficulties over their taxes, and if this should be the case there may be one or two half breed children attending the reserve school. I would say that I am willing to teach any half-breed children without additional payment from the provincial Department, for I think in places like that whatever opportunities are open for children to go to school should be taken. I mention this because you may have had some correspondence over the subject. If your Department are willing, I am, that is of course I suppose if there is room in the schoolhouse.\n\nAs far as I can gather at the present time, it will take about three weeks to get our furniture to the place, but we will get started on the way about the 3rd of July, and make the trip as quickly as we can. I have 330c of furniture to go, I cannot sell it, and buy again with prices as they are, as it is I might have to buy a stove.\n\nYears ago I believe the I.D. used to make a regular shipment up the lake once during the summer. If you still do this, and there is any chance of getting moved with a big shipment I would be glad if you would let me know, also any other information that you may have. Thanking you again for this opening,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 514-1, part 1)\nOttawa, May 30, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have yours of the 23rd instant, announcing your intention of accepting the position of teacher at the Grand Rapids Indian Day School. The facts concerning the equipment and cause in general, as intimated by you, are similar to those at the disposal of the Department. The work is more or less pioneer in type and, in view of the careless attitude of the parents at Grand Rapids to educational matters, there is a great work to be done.\n\nConcerning the shipment of your furniture and household effects, you had better get in touch with Mr. Inspector J. R. Bunn, Winnipeg, Man., who will give you any information concerning transportation on Lake Winnipeg.\n\nAs soon as the Department hears from the Rev. Archdeacon Mackay, your appointment will be officially approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferguson\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nF. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nOld Sun's Boarding School,\nGleichen, Alta.\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter No. 125-11-1, of the 6th ultimo, I beg to inform you that Mr. Gentleman has definitely accepted the offer of the charge of the Grand Rapids Indian Day School, under the terms stated in your letter.\n\nMr. Gentleman will leave the Old Sun's School immediately after the close of the June quarter, and will proceed to Grand Rapids as soon as he can find suitable means of transport. He hopes to reach his destination about the beginning of August. It is probable that August, or at least a part of that month may be holidays, and Mr. Gentleman may not start teaching until towards the end of the month, or the beginning of September. He has asked me to enquire if the Department will allow him two months salary in September quarter, even if he does not start teaching until about or towards the beginning of September. He submits this request on the ground that his expenses in moving from his present post to Grand Rapids will be very heavy, and these expenses will have to be borne by himself.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYours obediently,\n\nJ. A. Mackay.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier Esq.\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa\nOttawa, June 10, 1922.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, informing the Department that Mr. P. H. Gentleman has definitely accepted the position of Teacher of the Grand Rapids Indian Day School, and that he intends to proceed to that point as soon after the end of the present month as he can find suitable means of transport. It is also noted that he will begin teaching about the end of August or the first of September, next.\n\nIf Mr. Gentleman completes the full year at this school and teaches the required number of days, viz.: 200, to the end of June, 1923, he will be paid his full yearly salary of $650 per annum, plus bonus. In making payment of salary for the quarter ending September 30th, next, we will deal as generously as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nVen.

I have been expecting a letter from you, but I hear that you are away from Ottawa, and Rev. Archdeacon MacKay writes that there is no hitch in the appointments, and rather than wait doing nothing here, I have arranged the journey so transportation on Lake Winnipeg is rather uncertain at the present time, we can leave Selkirk on the 25th or after the 18th August and we want to get the first boat if we can. The C.P.R. tell us that the furniture will reach Selkirk in time.\n\nI have finished all the business I can in connection with this place and arranged the holidays for the boys, suitable to both parents' school work. Of course I feel it is a little risky to send the things forward without official notification, but I am sure you must be away. The parents of children here are expressing regret at our leaving and the boys have presented me with a splendid club bag. We are going for a week in the mountains and shall go to Winnipeg on the 19th.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6235, file 514-1, part 1)\nGrand Rapids, Manitoba. August 4th, 1922\n\nR.T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSuperintendent Indian Schools\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nMrs Gentleman and myself reached this reserve last week after having to spend three days in a fishing camp in Lake Winnipeg, and doing the last 90 miles in an open gas trailer in a heavy sea, and spending $300 in travelling expenses since leaving Gleichen.\n\nI am taking the liberty of sending a requisition for school material direct as there is nothing on hand whatever, and I learned in Selkirk that the Agent would be here on August 18th, and that also he would be away paying treaty in the meantime, and of course it would take him a few days to return, and the list may be delayed in his office. If as I have stated same can be filled there is just time to get the material up on the last boat of the Northern Fish Co., the first week in September. To wait until the agent came up would mean that material could not reach me until the October mail came from the Pas, and I think it is 90\u00a2 a ewt from the Pas alone, while from Selkirk it is only 50\u00a2 a ewt.\n\nI have asked for enough material for a year, or six months at least. From what I have seen of the people there must be about 25 children of school age on the reserve, and by the looks of things school matters seem to have got to a somewhat slack stage. I don't think it is entirely the fault of the people. I observe that they all speak English, even the old women, which is somewhat unusual. They certainly appear to take a little more interest in life in general than the Blackfeet. I met several of the people with their families on Sandy Island fishing for the Northern Co., and making good wages. The Wolverine also has two deckhands belonging to this place.\n\nThe schoolhouse is a log shanty, I should say about 16 by 22. It contains twelve desks of which four are broken, one map of Manitoba, one stove, and a piece of blackboard about 5' by 7', and is lighted by four small windows, two on each side. The floor goes this way\u2014and the ceiling this way\u2014and the chief tells me that it was built when he was a boy, as near as I can make out about 35 years ago. From conversations I have had with the people I see no reason why they should not take as much interest in school matters as other bands do, and I conclude that Mr. Bunn is correct in his statement in his letter that they would do so if some interest was taken by their teacher. They have not had anything of a school concert, school fair, or school sports, and on the\nwhole, for the last few years at least, have had little encouragement in their school. The place is unfenced, and no school garden attempted, and every family has crowds of dogs, who do the work of horses.\n\nOn the other side of the river there is the townsite of Grand Rapids in which there is a public school under the control of the Commissioner for Northern Manitoba. This school has been from time to time opened, teacher coming in and remaining three months as there is no house, and they have to board with the people. These people with one exception, are non treaty Indians. The provincial dept. cannot get their taxes, and it is no good to sell them out as no one would make an offer for lots in this part of the world.\n\nI observe that some of the children's names appear on our register, and the people seem anxious to combine the two schools if that could be possible. Mr Buteher told me that the provincial dept. have made several attempts to open up without getting much result, on the other hand the people say that either at Cedar lake or another reserve between here and the Pas, the pupils from the public school and the Indian school have been combined, and have made a very good school. There are I am told about 20 children of school age over the river.\n\nThe location of our schoolhouse is at one end of the reserve, Mr Buteher telling me that in the spring and fall it is impossible for either teacher or pupils to reach it on account of sloughs and water. The mission house that I am occupying is at the other end of the reserve. Both are too old to move, and the church will have to build a new house sooner or later. A good log school and teachers house could be built in a dry central location at a very small cost, as there are plenty of logs close, and also several empty houses the upper logs of which should be in good order.\n\nI understand that it has been the custom of certain of the Indians to complain, over something or other, which might continue after the first six months. Before we arrived I am told that it was said that if they don't like us, they will soon get someone else. Do not take any notice of these matters. I can assure you that I would not think of spending out all this money without the intention of doing our very best. I will be careful not to give cause for them to complain, but I know that some Indians get cranky over nothing at all. From what I have seen of the children they look to me to be some good material to work upon, and I hope I shall get results which will meet with your satisfaction, as well as those of the parents.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

They have been instructed, if these supplies can reach Selkirk by the first of September, to address same to you, c/o the Northern Fish Co., Selkirk, Man., per S.S. \"Wolverine\". If, however, they consider these supplies would not reach Selkirk before that time, they should be forwarded by mail, addressed to you at Grand Rapids, via The Pas, Man.\n\nWe did not order the three dozen slates, as they would be liable to breakage in transit. You may arrange for the purchase of this number. You should obtain itemized accounts, in duplicate, and certify thereon that the slates have been received and the prices charged are fair and just. These accounts should be forwarded to the Department for payment.\n\nWe are not ordering the maps of the Lake Winnipeg district.\n\nWe have noted the conditions which you mention regarding the school building. Your letter will be referred to Mr. Perrier upon his return to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nfor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nGrand Rapids,\nVia The Pas, Man.\nOTTAWA, September 9, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nYours of the 4th ultimo was brought to my attention upon my return to Ottawa. I note that there are many difficulties in connection with the successful operation of the Grand Rapids Indian Day School, but from the tone of your letter I feel quite confident that the best possible will be done.\n\nI am pleased to have your suggestions regarding a combined public and Indian school. As you are more familiar with the conditions existing on the other side of the river, the Department would be grateful for a complete report on the possibility of having the children on both sides attend the one school. You should intimate what seasons of the year the crossing is dangerous and impassable.\n\nI have noted that the school house is located at one end of the Reserve and the Mission House at the other, and that both are too old to move. This matter will be kept in mind when we are preparing our building programme for the coming fiscal years.\n\nWe trust that the difficulties with which you meet will not be insuperable, and that you and your wife will enjoy the pioneer work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

(RG 10, Volume 6235, file 514-1, part 1)\nGrand Rapids, Sept. 30th, 1922.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose the returns of the school for the present quarter, which I would ask you to forward to Ottawa as soon as possible.\n\nI also enclose an expense account, and an account for the Chief for lumber, which I hope will be passed. I may say that I found the blackboard in the school far too small, and I have covered the new part with some black material I found in the house. It is by no means satisfactory yet, but it is the best I can do. I also found that out of the 15 double desks, ten needed repairing. In this case also, I have done the best possible under the circumstances, as there is nothing here. Whoever put the newest desks together, did a very poor piece of work, and we need an entire new outfit of desks, single ones.\n\nI may say, as you will observe that I have a full attendance of pupils, which I would like the Department to note. In addition to this I have not refused to teach any children who have come from the other side of the river, which many of them have done bringing their own seats with them, but even with this I have in two cases, three children to a desk, and also the place is now full. There are still more children over the river, but whom I must refuse for the simple reason that there is no room inside to place their seats.\n\nI also find that the children are very backward, and that for some years past there appears to have been very little order kept in the schoolhouse, which makes things somewhat difficult, as most of the children are young, and appear to have looked upon the school as a play-place. Judging from the number of young men and women who appear to be able to read and write very little, who must have attended the school in the past, I think that such has been the state of affairs for some time past. I have never been with a band in which there have been such a number of young people. There seems to be only one or two old people in the band.\n\nI have in the past visited Reserves at which the Department have good school equipment, but for various reasons, no children to\nspeak of, but in this case it is the other way round. There will be for some years a good number of children of school age, who should be in attendance, and I hope some improvements in buildings will be considered.\n\nI would also like to inform the Department that Chief Turner appears to be one of the best Indians I have ever met. He has been very helpful to us, seeing that we are supplied with fish, milk, eggs, etc., which in places like these is helpful, besides which, a point to their favor, most of such things have been gifts. He has made known to the people that all children of school age should attend, and is setting them a good example by sending his own.\n\nI am unable to fill in the \"Band No\" of the children, there is no record here, and to do so, I would have to inspect all their tickets.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(SGD) P. H. Gentlemen.\n\nH.O. Latulippe, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Manitoba.\nGrand Rapids, Manitoba, August 22, 1922.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAccording to your request for a report on the school building, and children on the reserve, I am able to supply you with the following details.\n\nSize of school-house, 32 by 20, 5 ft. from floor to ceiling, loft above.\n\nWindows, two on each side, 2\u00bd by 4\u00bd. Nailed in solid, appear to have never been opened since place was built. Double windows on only two.\n\nNo screens.\n\nFloor and ceiling, V joint lumber laid upside down both sagging.\n\nWalls, log, Whitewashed inside and out, heated by box stove. No means of getting fresh air into the building except by the door.\n\nSeating, Desks for twenty children, four broken none graded in size XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Blackboard, 3ft by 6 Swinging (A swinging blackboard is a new one on me)\n\nLot unfenced, Building about thirty or thirty-five years old.\n\nAt present time, with rations placed in one end of it, it is in my judgement entirely unsuitable for its purpose.\n\nChildren, From enquiries made among the people, and the church register of Baptisms and burials, there appears to be about twenty children of school age at the present time, with a still larger number of children under school age. There is also a provincial school not working in the town sight of Grand Rapids, which should have about the same number. The success of the school on the other side of the river, has if anything been less that our Indian school. The children are all Cree speaking, with two exceptions, and there is a strong desire on the part of the half-breed people to have the two schools combined in the same way as has been done in similar locations in both the Pas, and Norway House Agency. Last week I met at the boat the Chairman of the Methodist board of Missions in the Norway House district who told me that this worked very well, the Provincial government made a grant, which allowed the I.D to reduce their teachers salary without reducing the amount received by the teacher.\n\nThe Supt. of Indian Education would I think, like to consider the local conditions of the people. He may be informed that the only means of their getting a living is by hunting in the winter and fishing in the summer, and the Indians themselves understand that their boys should learn these occupations at an early age, and from their point of view the school fails in its first purpose i.e., to fit their children to get a living for themselves later on in life.\n\nThe local conditions may govern this to a large extent, but not sufficient to warrant the withdrawal of educational effort. In talking with Tug Captains, fishing camp bosses, and trawler Owners I have met with the same remark, and that is XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX the boys know nothing. All the young Indian will ask is,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 514-1, part 1)\n\"How much have I got coming to me\" and does not know enough to add up his own fishing account. A good ground work in common Arithmetic would overcome this in a few years time. The geography of the lake would also be helpful. I think also that the boys would take very quickly to the material found in the \"Sea Scouts handbook\" as well as the Boys scouts book.\n\nRegarding the girls, there appears to be no reason why their Native arts should not be developed. There is plenty of material such as brown birch bark, and hides to be obtained, and there is a ready sale for all basket work, and bead and silk work, the demand is larger than the supply, but there instruction books on this work to be had, and good work could be done by instruction XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX Much of their native work is crude, and poor.\n\nA considerable influence could, I think, be brought upon the parents by the encouragement of the school garden, and instruction to the children along such lines. I observe a few patches of potatoes at the house, but that is all, and the patches are small. Any encouragement along these lines would in a few years time help out the Departments ration list.\n\nBesides the usual school subjects, by giving instructions on subjects suitable for local conditions, it will I think be found, that the parents will take more interest in their school than in the past.\n\nMy instructions in the past have been from Agents and Inspectors and from headquarters have been that as much effort as possible should be given in the school to make their parents feel that it is to their own interests to have their children attend, governed by local conditions, and I presume that a similar desire is required in this location.\n\nThe present plant at our disposal does not help very much to that end, and should the department decide upon a better building or a teachers house close to the present building, as you know, logs, stone, gravel & plaster are here on the spot, and suitable log schoolhouse could be built at small outlay, in fact I think that the Indians themselves if asked to do so would provide the logs providing some employment could be given them on a new building.\n\nThey themselves tell me that the schoolhouse is old, and cold comes in from the floor, I feel sure, that if a mid day meal was promised them for the children attending, that they would undertake something towards a better building.\n\nOf course, with such means at my disposal at the present time I will do all I can to arouse their interest in the school work, but it would be a vast encouragement to them, as well as the people on the other side of the river if the buildings could be improved, and combined. From these notes you will I think be able to place before the Department such recommendations as you see fit.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nH.O.M. Latulippe Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nP.H.

Gentleman, the school teacher at the Grand Rapids Indian Reserve in reference to the enclosed vouchers NO. 825 & 826/22 and also reporting the present condition of the school as far as the desks are concerned I beg to say that it would be impossible to have same delivered this year as navigation is closed to Grand Rapids for this fall.\n\nYou will also find a copy of communication dated August 22nd, which I received on my return from leave of absence. No doubt Mr. Gentleman has had a great deal of experience and is a splendid teacher. I would consider that the combine of the Indian and White schools at Grand Rapids would be a benefit to all concerned but the school should be constructed on the Indian Reserve. I would be very pleased if the Department would refer this matter to Mr. Inspector J.R. Bunn.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 514-1, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing copies of letters from Mr. R. H. Gentleman, Teacher of the Grand Rapids Indian Day School. The accounts which were enclosed have been paid and cheques directed under separate cover. I have noted that the teacher has secured a full attendance and that the classroom is crowded. It may be necessary to provide new desks, and you should make a recommendation to the Department in this connection. Following your suggestion, Mr. Gentleman should, for the time being, take in only a few pupils from across the river, so as not to crowd out the Indian boys and girls for whom the school is intended.\n\nThe matter of combining the Indian day school with the provincial college on the other side of the river has already been brought to the Department's attention, and we are awaiting further reports. I am of the opinion that such a scheme is impracticable because of the seasons during which the river would be impassable.\n\nIf Mr. Gentleman will offer utilitarian instruction to the older boys and girls, this Department is prepared to supply special equipment upon his request. Since the boys should be interested in fishing industry and, as the teacher suggests, the geography of Lake Winnipeg should be emphasized, Mr. Gentleman might hold classes in basket, bead and silk work.\n\nThe Department is writing to Mr. Inspector Bunn for his suggestions on some of these problems. He is familiar with the situation at Grand Rapids, and will be of much assistance in determining the policy. I am enclosing a copy of this letter, for you to direct to Mr. Gentleman.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. O.

We have been in communication with Mr. Agent Latulippe and the new Teacher, Mr. F. H. Gentleman, and a decision has as yet not been made.\n\nIs a new school building needed in the immediate future? Is it practicable to combine our cause with the work on the other side of the river, which has at times been conducted under provincial authorities? The Department fears that the river may be impassable at certain seasons of the year. We would like your opinion on these questions at this time, and would ask you to keep them in mind at the time of your next visit to Grand Rapids.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nChambers of Commerce,\nPrincess St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Mr. Perrier,\n\nI must thank you for your encouraging letter of September 9th, which reached me on October 14th.\n\nIn reply, I should say that there are 20 half-breed children on the other side of the river, of school age. Their parents, disposed of their lots just before the war, and would be termed squatters. They live by hunting and fishing as the Indians do, and the children are all Cree speaking, and are much more backward than the Indian children. The matter of crossing the river in the spring and fall varies. I am told that there might be a week or ten days during which they cannot cross, but this year the river on the 17th was entirely open, and on the 26th, the people were crossing on the ice. There is a public school building in Grand Rapids village, but it is not up to much. They have pretty well ruined it by using it as a dance hall. The last teacher they had over there left in February last, after three months work. The Manitoba Government seems to have had a number of teachers from time to time, but none stay longer than a quarter. There is no place at which a teacher could board.\n\nI have had about a dozen of these half-breed children over into our school. They are making progress, and the arrangement gives the settlement some satisfaction. Their parents have been putting them over daily. Please inform me, if I may send a return of this attendance of half-breed children to the Provincial Educational department. That department, I suppose, would include Grand Rapids village in its grants to the public school, and they might send me a cheque, which would come very acceptable, as my expenses during the past six months have been heavy.\n\nI conclude that you would take up the subject of a combined school with the Provincial authority, with the suggestion that they should in future undertake part of the expenses, which would be only right. I should also say that the Public school has never been inspected by a Provincial Inspector, and they would thus not be in a position to say much about the state of the children's education on the other side.\n\nI find that within the past few weeks in our own school we have been able to do little work after 2-30 in the afternoon as it gets so dark. The windows are so small, and the thick bush on two sides does not help much.\n\nI am issuing rations, which the Agent had placed in the school at treaty time, and the people are calling upon Mrs Gentleman for drugs, and things when children are sick, but as so few of these things were sent in I am told, we are having to give them out from our own small stores.\n\nThere appears also to be some need among the people for clothing. There are a couple of traders in the settlement, but in neither, are any dry-goods kept. Both these stores are in a very\nIn any way of business with supplies limited to flour, sugar & tea.\n\nAt John Smith's we received yearly from the Agency, a bolt of print, serge, galathea, some pants, & some blankets. Nothing of that appears to come to this place, and it would be really a help if such could be granted. Mrs Gentleman and myself have given away everything that we really can spare. I am badly in need of blankets for the old people, and some pants for the boys. One of the girls appears at school with a bathing costume worn as a jumper with only a little coat and skirt. I have gone to some trouble to find out the reason, and it seems that it is partly owing to there being nothing nearer than the Pas, and also the poor fishing. Neither the fishing or the hunting is what it used to be years ago.\n\nI observe that the people have a few head of cattle, which they care for themselves, which I think will be helpful to them in years to come, and if the matter of new buildings is considered by the Department it might be pointed out that this band have in the past not called upon the Department to any great extent, also that they show some inclination to take care of what they have got, which is not always the case. They appear to me to be a band well worthy of consideration, and an Improved day school would work fine. They are poor, about the poorest I have come across, but this I feel is due to their location. I suppose in the early days, hunting and fishing was good. Sooner or later they will have to take to the farming and cattle industry, and the school should be a means to bring this more before them.\n\nFrom this information I trust you will be able to convince those who have the estimates in hand for another year, but if there any other details needed, I would be glad to supply them or send them to the Agent whichever you desire.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 514-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, Dec. 19, 1922.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, relative to general conditions at the Grand Rapids Indian Day School. I am pleased to have this information concerning the work. I have noted that there is no public school activity across the river and that about a dozen of the children are coming over to the Indian School for their education. You may send a return of their attendance to the Manitoba Department of Education, and it may be possible to secure a grant for the work that you are doing on their behalf.\n\nThe claims on Parliamentary Appropriation for Indian Education are very numerous and pressing at this time and I am not very hopeful that a day school can be erected at Grand Rapids this coming calendar year. As soon as we are successful, however, in securing funds for this purpose, this Department will get in touch with the Manitoba Department of Education with a view to arranging for a joint or combined Public and Indian School. The expenses in that case will be divided.\n\nRegarding the supplying of drugs and relief clothing, a separate communication will be addressed to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Forster,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nGrand Rapids,\nVia The Pas, Man.\nGrand Rapids, Manitoba, January 1st, 1923.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI must thank you for your letter of November 2nd, which reached me by the last mail, and the enclosures therein.\n\nRegarding school matters I am glad to see that the Department have under consideration these difficulties, and the report referred to me is, I expect that which required the number and ages of the children on both sides of the river, which I forwarded to Ottawa by the last mail.\n\nTherein, I endeavoured to make clear that the present standing of the school in every respect, is by no means as high as other Department schools in the western provinces. The present pupils in attendance have always been crowded so close together, that the order and discipline of the school is very low, and that the progress which should be made, is not made. I am not surprised that under the present conditions that teachers in the past have become more or less discouraged, and the parents have been inclined to complain, certainly in my experience with other Indian children, there is much to be desired as regards the pupils here.\n\nI observe that the Department are willing to provide such material suitable for instruction with regards local conditions and I had in mind a compass mariners, maps and charts of Lake Winnipeg and signal books, most of which can be supplied by the Department of Marine and Fisheries at very low cost, all of which would be most useful to these boys. The provision of such things I would not suggest at the present time, owing to the lack of space, also the boys should advance at least as far as the third reader.\n\nThere have been several years, which I have observed that all the children in the various schools are from ten to fourteen with few younger ones. As time goes on this changes and the elder children's places are taken by smaller children, hence the suitability of adjustable steel desks, which provide suitable seating for all ages at all times. Single adjustable desks, steel, as used in the public schools of Winnipeg cost about $8.50 each. Cast iron ended desks are an expense to the Department. This school as you know is cold from Friday to Monday, and the frost snaps the iron ends, two more having gone within the past few weeks. I have screwed some down but the floor is so soft, that they don't hold long.\n\nFrom the enclosed returned you will observe that the average attendance has been maintained, also a number of children from over the river have come across. I notice that the Department desire the Indian children to have first consideration and with this in view, I have kept the Indian children's places, and permitted the half-breed children to occupy whatever space might be at disposal. Drill and exercises cannot be carried out during the winter months. The children have never done any singing, but I can obtain an organ next summer.\nIn event of a new school being decided upon, I would also suggest that a move be made from the present sight, a little more than a quarter of a mile north, and placed facing the harbour mouth. Such a location would be within easy distance of all families on both sides, and about midway between the two churches. The entrance to the river and harbour is not buoyed, or marked and the last time the Wolverine came in she struck. The situation is such that a new building would make a splendid mark if placed in the correct position, and I think the Marine and Fisheries Department would be glad to have our Department assist them in this regard. As you know the river comes in at one corner of the harbour, and buildings placed in view of same are more noticeable than in the bush.\n\nThe Department have no other buildings on the reserve at present, and I have placed the rations in the small attic.\n\nRegarding the medicines, I have not seen Mr McKay, who is away but I have arranged with an Indian to bring them over. I don't think you have ever been in this house. We have really no place for them and everything freezes. I have papered the place, and keep three stoves going, but all our potatoes are frozen as well as our years supplies of canned fruit and milk. There is practically only one room in the house that we can keep warm. I understand that there are very few medicines on hand; these will keep under the best possible present conditions.\n\nI might also say that this is the first Indian school I have experienced in which none of the children have bad necks, or sores. There is one boy, almost past school age, a cripple whom I think is bad, but otherwise the children appear to be more healthy than others I have met with. Perhaps it is the use of fish oil.\n\nI quite understand that whatever the Department can do will have to wait until the lake opens up. You will be able to advise the Department that whatever is done, plans would have to be made very carefully, and very fully, as the distance from Selkirk, or the Pas does not permit material to be mislaid, but I expect between now and summer such matters will have been fully covered.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

From all I can learn he has made a real success of the day school at that place, although working under great disadvantages on account, chiefly of the poor condition of the buildings. He has a scheme which he has laid before your Agent, Mr Latulippe, which would not involve very heavy expenditure, and would greatly improve the condition of things.

H. Gentleman, Teacher of the Grand Rapids Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the scheme submitted by Mr. Gentleman to our agent would involve an expenditure of about $600, and it has been found necessary to postpone any building activity until funds can be provided. If the school at Grand Rapids continues to be a success, it may be possible to arrange for an appropriation to provide proper classroom and living quarters. In the interim, the Department is allowing any repairs or equipment that can be considered absolutely necessary for the proper conduct of the school for the coming winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nVen. Arcadegon J. A. MacKay,\nPaynton,\nSask.\nGrand Rapids, Manitoba, July 2nd, 1923.\n\nDear Mr. Perrier,\n\nOne of the difficulties in connection with this place is getting in household supplies; it is impossible to get stuff from the Pas, which compels one to order from Winnipeg to take advantage of a boat that runs at odd times during the month of August only direct from Selkirk to the mouth of the river. A whole year's supplies have to be ordered of everything that is needed, which means a payment of about $300.\n\nI am placing this order with the Hudson Bay Co., Winnipeg by this mail, as the August mail would be too late, but I think you will understand that it would be entirely unsatisfactory to have a year's supplies in, if there is any chance of a move.\n\nIf there is any likelihood of our being moved, I would be glad if you would write at once to the Hudson Bay Co., Winnipeg and request them to hold my order for the time being.\n\nAs far as I can see, we have had a very good school for the past twelve months, the people are satisfied, and the children have made some progress, and we are prepared to spend another winter in this house. I understand how difficult it is to get funds needed for building purposes, but the present conditions cannot be helped for the time being I know.\n\nI should not like any change made in teachers as regards this place, to take place at any time of the year with the exception of the month of August. Anyone with furniture must move in or out by the Northern Fish Co. boat, which is the only thing that can take a load. They sometimes run a trip the first week in October, but then they have more than they can handle. The only other way is an open gas boat, or canoe to the Pas, and dogs in winter, which cannot be used for freight at all. Under these circumstances I feel you will see how one has to look ahead.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gentleman teaches the Indian School at Grand Rapids and a suggestion has been made that he might divide his services between the school under your department and the public school at the north side of the river. The public school has been closed for some little time but there are at times a considerable number of children who should be provided for and it may be that Mr. Gentleman can handle the two schools by teaching half a day in each. I shall be glad to your opinion on this suggestion.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. Fletcher\nDeputy Minister.\nOttawa, August 26, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to the educational facilities at Grand Rapids. I have noted the suggestion that Mr. P. H. Gentleman, teacher of the Indian day school, devote half his time to the public school across the river. In reply I have to inform you that the Department has had some correspondence with Mr. Gentleman in this connection and it is considered that there is a sufficient number of children on each side of the river at Grand Rapids to warrant two day schools. It is impracticable to have a combined public and Indian school, because of the difficulties of crossing the river at certain seasons of the year. Further, the Department considers that all of Mr. Gentleman's time is required for the Indian work.\n\nI might inform you that the teacher of the Indian school, with our permission, has allowed a few children from the white settlement on the north side of the river to attend his classes. He has been instructed, however, that these children must not crowd the accommodation of the Indian pupils or interfere with the instruction of our wards.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nDr. R. Fletcher,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Education,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nGrand Rapids, Manitoba, September 20th, 1924.\n\nMr. Ferrier,\n\nThe September mail reached us a few days ago, but did not contain any correspondence regarding the school. I rather expected something from Commissioner Graham, but I wanted to write you on other matters, as I think it best to keep you informed. I wished to make it clear to Commissioner Graham that any work done at this place must take advantage of the boat that runs only in July and August.\n\nHowever other matters. By this time I expect you have received a visit from the Bishop of Saskatchewan, who was here on August 17th. At that time the Bishop had requests of a threefold nature. First that he should place an ordained man in charge of the Church work, Second, that I should continue the teaching, with which the people were well satisfied; Third, that he should use his influence with the Manitoba Government to have a teacher appointed for the village school of Grand Rapids over the river. His Lordship noted these requests, and told them of the shortage of ordained men, and I believe expressed some intention of calling on the Manitoba Educational Dept to see what the position was regarding the Public school.\n\nBesides the visit of the Bishop the settlement has been visited by Mr. Bracken, Prime Minister of Manitoba, and Mr. Black, the member, and then later by Commissioner Campbell, whose office has now been discontinued by the Manitoba Government. The request for a teacher over the river was put up to the ministers by Henry Mackay, and they appear to have promised them a teacher. In this request the Mackay family are entirely alone, the rest of the settlement (which really consists of non-treaty Indians) are entirely satisfied with the present arrangement. When Commissioner Campbell came along from the Pan, I understood that it appeared that the Ministers had made various promises, and then left him to carry them out, which put him in a bad way unless they voted the money; briefly he was the \"goat\". I asked him to let me know what the Winnipeg authorities intended doing, and by this mail I have word of his being out of office but that it had been suggested that I should teach six months on each side of the river using their old schoolhouse. This I think is the outcome of some expression on the part of the other halfbreeds who met the Ministers, and Commissioner Campbell at the Fishing Camp at Horse Island, at which time they asked that even if a teacher was appointed, members to the public school, would they be allowed to send their children across the river. Of course I believe they were told that the question would have to be answered by the I.D., but as far as I can see the Manitoba Government have suddenly woke up to the fact that it would be a piece of foolishness to have two teachers in the settlement costing round about a thousand each, when one man could do the work, and they will be looking for a way out of the difficulty. Their main difficulty is with Henry Mackay. He won't be satisfied with anything less than a teacher who will board at his place, and a combined school on either side would not satisfy him.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 514-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nWhen the late Archdeacon Mackay advised me regarding conditions here, he referred to considerable difficulty over Church matters over the river, which he hoped I might avoid, so when the halfbreed people asked me to take in their children, I agreed while they had no teacher, and were also willing to occupy somewhat restricted space, my object being to avoid any offence, and I thought it would only be for a short while in any case.\n\nNow there is the mission work, which of course the Bishop has in view. He did not promise them an ordained man, but at present our clergyman comes from the Pas when he can, and it would be a saving of travelling expenses, and perhaps satisfy all quarters if they did have an ordained man, and this I have suggested to the Bishop. I understand from Mr. Frazer, our clergyman at the Pas mission, that you intend building a new dayschool at the Pas next year. They have two ordained men at the Pas, and that school could be very well taught by a layman, and in view of all these circumstances I have asked the Bishop if it would not be better to get an ordained man for this place and let us go to the Pas. The three authorities, that is yourselves, the Manitoba Government, and the Bishop would have to come to some arrangement about this place either combined or otherwise, and as far as I can see Mr. Henry Mackay will not be happy unless it is otherwise.\n\nHowever, I wish to go home to England for a visit next summer holidays. My Mother is getting on in years, and I should make the trip. To do so, I might have to apply to the Bank of Montreal for a loan. I have been a customer of theirs since 1911, and have never applied for a loan before. I have a fully paid up insurance policy for a fair amount, but of course I should not be able to obtain this unless I was certain of a future post. I would like if possible to leave here at the end of June, and open up your new school at the Pas on September last next year. I expect you will think I am looking ahead a bit, but by the time this gets considered by the different parties, it will be along into January or February, and then I want, if I can arrange with the Church to have some of my heavy furniture taken over, and our April and May mail is very uncertain. I am also concerned about the health of Mrs. Gentleman which is not as well as I would like; she is well, but we would like to be closer to the Doctor if that is possible.\n\nMr. Frazer told me that the Pas people seem to be serious in their desire for a dayschool. I thought at first it was merely talk and worry, similar to the village school difficulty at this place, but if they are serious, I feel sure my experience could be of some help, and in that place a teacher would be free from ration troubles, and various other kinds of difficulties. I would help them in the church of course if needed, but I would not be responsible for that work as I am here. I have a good deal of school equipment of my own, picture machine, woodworking bench, and I hope to pick up some other useful helps either in the east, or at home next summer.\n\nI hope you will be able to give us careful consideration, and advise us what would be best; I shall likely not receive your answer before December, and it would be by the January mail before I could reply.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 514-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, November 6, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of September 20th, with general reference to conditions at the Little Grand Rapids Indian Day School and relative to your wish to return to Indian work following a vacation in England during July and August of next year.\n\nIn August, last, the Manitoba Department of Education asked for an expression of our wishes for the future of Grand Rapids. Dr. Fletcher was informed that the Department of Indian Affairs would maintain a school at this point for its wards, and it was suggested that a provincial school be started on the other side of the river. I cannot understand how a combined school would be successful, because of the difficulty of crossing the river at certain seasons of the year.\n\nThere is some discussion concerning the advisability of re-opening a day school for Indian children at The Pas. A decision has not been reached as yet in this connection, but I wish to assure you that the Department will give favourable consideration if the church authorities nominate you for The Pas or any other Indian day school in September.\n\nI regret that the arrangements could not be completed in time to erect proper buildings at Grand Rapids this year. I am confident, however, that a suitable school and teacher's residence will be built during the coming building season.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nP. H. Gentleman, Esq.,\nGrand Rapids,\nVia The Pas, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nI duly received your letter of January 29th, and note that a decision has been reached to place the school, and teachers living together at this place, which I think will remove a great deal of past difficulties.\n\nI much regret to say that my wife's health still causes me considerable anxiety. These people are not of a type that one would care to have in the house, even if it was possible to get them, and the schoolhouse is twenty-five minutes walk from the house, thus Mrs Gentleman is entirely alone the whole of the day, which I fear is not very helpful.\n\nI do not think it possible that her health will allow us to return to such a remote place as this is, but there are a few reserves that might be considered, if they should happen to become vacant, such as the headquarters of Carlton Agency, Fisher River, or the Pas, if a school is built there. In such places there is medical advice, and also the possibility of getting some household assistance.\n\nThe teachers at Fisher River and Carlton would, I feel sure do, satisfactory work, I have met them both, and there would be no need for a change at those places, and under the circumstances I fear that we must retire from the work, unless a suitable school becomes vacant at a later date.\n\nI would like, however, to know if I am correctly informed that under a Civil Service Insurance Act of 1914, employees retired after serving ten years or upward become entitled to a pension of ten-fiftieths of the average salary of the last three years, and also if, under such an act an allowance can be made to myself and my wife, if my wife's health does not permit a return to the west. Mrs Gentleman has not been well for the past three years but it appears to have become to be an accepted thing among the people that the wife of the teacher should visit the sick, and assist the Indian women with all kinds of their difficulties, and troubles. Since 1913 we have been entirely at their call at all hours, except during the time we spent at the Blackfoot reserve when the children required entire attention.\n\nI have no other interest or undertakings, or other business of any kind. My entire time has been given to the Department. I mention this because I have met so many men who have run farms on a side line to which they could retire to.\n\nI would like to take the opportunity to talk over this matter, or other possible work, on the way to Montreal, and would arrange to stop over a day in Ottawa, as near as I can tell at present on the 9th or 10th of July. It is quite possible that if we could manage to miss one western winter, my wife's health may allow us to take up the work again next spring.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 514-1, part 1)\nOttawa, May 16th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, relative to a transfer from your present position as teacher of the Grand Rapids Indian Day School to some other of our Indian schools more convenient to access. It is noted that on account of your wife's health, you do not feel that it will be possible to return to such a remote place as Grand Rapids. We are not yet in a position to state what vacancies there will be in any of the schools in the Fisher River, Pas or Carleton Agencies. The Superintendent of Indian Education has noted your intention to visit Ottawa on or about the 9th of July, next, and shall be pleased if you will notify him in due time as to the exact date of your visit, when he will arrange to be in his office and will be glad to see you and to discuss the question of a transfer to some other school.\n\nRegarding your query as to whether you would be entitled, as a teacher having 10 years' experience, to come under the provisions of the Civil Service Superannuation Act, I beg to say that as you have not contributed towards this scheme during the period of your employment you would not be entitled to receive any of the benefits of same. Only permanent Civil Servants are eligible for superannuation. Teachers in Indian day schools are classed as temporary Civil Servants, as they are exempt from the operations of the provisions of the Civil Service Act insofar as the principle of competition in the matter of appointment is concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

His wife and two boys joined him this summer coming via Winnipeg, and they are a thoroughly nice family with two well behaved little boys. I had no opportunity to inspect the school children but everyone seemed to be pleased with the progress made. The house however is quite unsatisfactory. The building itself is log and built backwards road to the lake front. The inside is quite unfinished and unfit for anyone to live in as it is. I found all his winter supplies and all the new mission furniture in the new school building where they are living, and after going carefully into the whole matter, I instructed him to stay where he was in the new school building until his house was properly finished and if necessary have the desks moved up to the old school building until the house was ready. Who is to blame for this I do not wish to say but a little checking up of the Indian Agent in Winnipeg would not do any harm. That Reserve is a very isolated one during seven months of the year and when we do get a really good teacher for places like that we want to keep them satisfied.\n\nG. E. Saskatchewan.\nBishop.\nSelkirk, Man. 3rd December, 1927\n\nSir,\n\nI have received letters from Mr. J.W. Waddy, Indian Agent at The Pas and Mrs. Chas. Wyatt, wife of the teacher at Grand Rapids Reserve, informing me of the serious illness of Mr. Wyatt, who has been at the hospital at The Pas for five weeks, suffering from dropsy following pleurisy.\n\nMrs. Wyatt writes asking the Department to grant her a temporary appointment as teacher at the Grand Rapids Indian Day School, until her husband is strong enough to take up his duties again. I would strongly recommend that the Department approve of this as she is well qualified to carry on, and has done splendid work among the Indian women and children since she went there a year ago, and there is a marked improvement in the dress and cleanliness owing to her efforts.\n\nWill you kindly answer this at once, so that I will be able to notify her by the next mail to Grand Rapids.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs Agent,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 7th, 1927.\n\nC. A. Stevenson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nTemporary appointment Mrs. Charles Wyatt as teacher Grand Rapids School approved during absence on account of illness of her husband STOP Please notify her accordingly\n\nJ. D. McLEAN.\n\nShg. Dept. I.A.\nSelkirk, Man., 14th January, 1928\n\nSir,\n\nI regret to have to inform you that I received a telegram from Mr. J.W. Waddy, Indian Agent at The Pas, notifying me of the death of Mr. Chas. Wyatt, school teacher, at Grand Rapids Indian Day School, who died at the Hospital, The Pas, on 10th instant.\n\nI have written to Mrs. Wyatt, who had been appointed teacher, during Mr. Wyatt's illness, requesting her to carry on, in the meantime, until another teacher was appointed, and also to let me know at once what plans she had made. It will be several days before I can hear from her but will advise you at once, when word comes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJanuary 17th, 1928.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nMr. Charles Wyatt the Teacher on the Grand Rapids Indian Reserve at the mouth of the Saskatchewan River has been in the hospital at the Pas for nearly three months. A message from Rural Dean Fraser of the Pas reached me yesterday that he had died in the hospital.\n\nMr. Wyatt was originally in the Imperial forces and after receiving his education as a Teacher was discharged as fit and therefore there is no help to be expected from that quarter either for the expense of his sickness or for the widow. In fact I hardly think any claim for sickness would lie with the Imperial authorities because there is no doubt that he caught this congestion by exposure at Grand Rapids.\n\nHe looked after the Sunday school on the Reserve and for this the Church paid him $250 per annum beyond the Indian Dept stipend.\n\nThe Hospital secretary has sent me the enclosed bill but we certainly cannot and could not pay this from our Mission Funds. I am sending Rural Dean Fraser a grant of $100 to help the widow pay the necessary expenses of the funeral at the Pas but I think the hospital bill ought to come from the Department.\n\nThe widow has two boys at Grand Rapids and it will be impossible for them to move out of the house during the winter months, neither would it be possible for us to send in another teacher yet awhile.\n\nThe Indian Agent at Winnipeg got Mrs. Wyatt leave to go on with the teaching as long as the husband was in the hospital and I would suggest that she be allowed to continue teaching the school until the end of June when the school closes for the summer holidays.\n\nIf the Department would do these two things it would be a great help in the time of need.\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 514-1, part 1)\nJanuary 19, 1928.\n\nDear Bishop Lloyd:\n\nI was much grieved when I read your letter of the 13th instant concerning the death of Mr. Charles Wyatt, formerly missionary teacher at Grand Rapids. All reports concerning his work were very satisfactory. I greatly regret that the Department has no authority to issue a cheque to cover his hospital expenses. I am sure Your Lordship understands that the expenditure of parliamentary appropriation is under keen scrutiny and must not be used for purposes other than those for which the money was voted.\n\nYour Lordship will know that I am very sympathetic when I inform you that full salary has been allowed since the first of September. I am also directing that the Department's approval be given for the engagement of Mrs. Wyatt until the end of June.\n\nI am returning the hospital account.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. G. B. Lloyd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nSelkirk, Man., 25th January, 1928\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to my letter of 14th instant, I have received a letter from Mrs. C. Wyatt, wife of the late teacher at the Grand Rapids Indian Day School, in which she says:\n\n\"I will continue to teach at Grand Rapids until you say otherwise. My future plans I do not know, I only know I must find a position somewhere to keep my little boys. I want work in the Indian work if possible. My dear husband loved the Indian work and working with him, I got to like it too. If you hear of a vacancy, I would be glad to hear about it, because it is the boys that I worry about, they must be seen to.\"\n\nAs Mrs. Wyatt is willing to carry on with the School I would recommend that her temporary appointment be extended at least until the end of the present term, at the same salary as her late husband was receiving, $95.00 per month. By that time she will be better able to decide whether she will remain, or a vacancy may occur which would be more suitable.\n\nMrs. Wyatt has done splendid work at Grand Rapids among the Indian women and girls.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 514-1, part 1)\nOttawa, February 1st, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, relative to the communication which you received from Mrs. Wyatt, wife of the late Charles Wyatt, formerly missionary teacher at Grand Rapids.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that the Department approves of Mrs. Wyatt carrying on the work as teacher at this school until the end of the present school year, viz., June 30th, next. Should her services during that time be satisfactory, the Department would have no objection to her remaining as teacher after that date providing her doing so meets with the approval of the Church authorities. We are allowing her salary at the same rate as was paid her late husband, viz., $95 per teaching month.\n\nPlease inform Mrs. Wyatt of the Department's approval of her carrying on the work as teacher at Grand Rapids, and it is hoped that she will meet with every success in her work. Please give her any assistance you can in this connection.

For the last year he has been teaching the Manitoba Provincial School at Grand Rapids on the other side of the river, so that he is not only thoroughly qualified but also knows the district and the Indians thoroughly.\n\nHe will return from a vacation in England to Grand Rapids on or about September the first.

Under these circumstances and as the Department thought that you possibly required the money at the time, you were allowed salary for the full March quarter, viz., $285.00. Information on hand shows that the school was closed from early in February and you were, therefore, allowed salary for two months of the March quarter during which the school was not open. The extra period you taught the school during the September quarter was considered as making up the time lost in the March quarter and the Department feels that salary for one month in the September quarter was all to which you were entitled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. R. B. Horsefield,\nTeacher,\nIndian Day School,\nGrand Rapids, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Armstrong are badly needed; there was no wire screening for the school house windows as a result of which the windows had to be kept down all the time, causing uncomfortable heat and stuffiness in the school room, several pains of glass were missing from the windows, and Mr. Armstrong had them covered with boards. The floor was also in bad condition and would be greatly improved by two coats of paint.\n\nThe house is also in bad repair and the things asked for in this requisition are very necessary, in order to brighten up the place as well as to make it warm, clean and comfortable for the family to live in. Although I hesitate to ask the Department to incur this expenditure, yet knowing as I do the splendid work these people are doing on the Reserve, and their inability to live comfortably without these improvements, I have no alternative, but to strongly recommend to the Department, that if at all possible, their request be acceded to and the order filled.\n\nIf approved kindly advise earliest convenience, and oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAndrew Irwin,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**PAY TO:** F.

Edward Thomas has returned from Hole River, Lake Winnipeg, where he has seen to the completion of the work you asked him to see after.\n\nI believe the work is well done, and I find Mr. Thomas, who is a competent carpenter himself, worked like the other men; perhaps this helped to keep the expense of the building within the limits of the item provided for its completion. I may add that Mr. Thomas used his own boat from Fort Alexander to the site of the School house which in taking out the men &c helped a little. He tells me he had a few lbs. of nails left and a little lumber with which a few much needed repairs were made to the Teacher's house, and he hopes that in this matter you will not find any fault for going beyond instructions.\n\nAt Black River it was intended to expend $50.00 repairing the old School House.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6235, file 515-1, part 1)\nHouse, but on careful examination Mr. Thomas found this would be unwise and he got the Indians to cut and haul logs for a new building which, as before stated, will be a great benefit to the band when it is completed.\n\nI trust the work done will be satisfactory and that these schools will in consequence be much better attended.\n\nI am, &c.\n\nR. Phair.\nSupt. Indian Missions.\nWinnipeg, 20 March 1909.\n\nVen. Sir,\n\nMr. Inspector Semmens has recently visited the Day School at Hollow Water River, and he reports that John Sinclair, the Teacher there, is very old and incompetent, and desires to be relieved of the school on the 30th. of June next. He wishes to be changed to Brokenhead; but I do not think he is fit to teach anywhere. At any rate he is doing no good at Hollow Water River, and you should select one to succeed him on Ist. July next.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nVen. Archdeacon Phair,\nFoot of Grenville St.,\nG., Winnipeg.\nOttawa, May 31, 1909.\n\nVery Rev. Sir,\n\nOn March 30, last, the late Indian Commissioner, Hon. David Laird, wrote, asking you to select a teacher to take charge of the Hollow Water River school after the end of the current quarter.\n\nFrom reports to hand it is quite evident that the present teacher, Mr. John Sinclair, is incapable of giving proper service, and his retention in the position would be unfair to the Indians.\n\nThe Department desires to raise the standard of the day schools and for its part is prepared to pay better salaries where qualified and efficient teachers, preferably with professional training, are engaged. You will be good enough, therefore, to make enquiries with a view to securing the services of a teacher to take charge of this school on its reopening after the summer vacation who will be able to assist the Department in carrying out the policy above referred to.\n\nKindly report the result of your enquiries to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

It being under my supervision I felt he was the proper person to act and I regret he has not done so.\n\nTrusting this will explain any attitude.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

Sir,\n\nI have the honour to inform your Lordship that on May the 31st and September 27th last, the Department wrote to the Ven. Archdeacon Phear, of Winnipeg, in reference to a change of teachers at the Hollow Water River School. In a reply recently received from him he states that he has referred this matter to your Lordship.\n\nNo return was received from this school for the September quarter last, and I have to ask your Lordship to be good enough to state whether Mr. Sinclair's services have been dispensed with, and, if so, whether a new appointment has been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nKensora, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nYours of the 19th re Yellow Water River School. Mr. Sinclair never sent his resignation to us, but on my return from the North in Oct., I was told he had given up the work in June.\n\nArch. & Phair never referred this to us at all, at least we heard nothing from him.\n\nI tried to secure a teacher before close of navigation but failed. Our missionary Rev. E. Thomas was at Yellow Water a fortnight ago, and appointed Miss Ross. She was 12 years at Brandon, and is quite capable of teaching. She began school on the 14th inst. We are in correspondence with a man to take this school, but he may not be able to go before April. I wrote Mr. Semmens the Inspector in Winnipeg only last Friday the 19th asking that Miss Ross be appointed permanent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

John Hemmens, S.S., Inspector of Indian Agencies, Winnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, June 10, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to refer Your Lordship an official letter of November 29th, last, in which the temporary appointment of Miss Ross as teacher of the Hollow Water River school was approved on the understanding that Your Lordship would endeavour to secure the services of a competent teacher this spring. A late report would lead the Department to believe that Miss Ross is not able to manage this school and that, if any results are to be obtained, a more competent teacher must be appointed.\n\nBe good enough to give this matter your consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. H. BOLEAM\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nKenora, Ont.\nTo the Secretary\n\nDept of Indians Affairs.\n\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to yours of the 10th inst., I had not heard anything of Miss Ross's work at Hollow water River.\n\nI had some time ago an application from Mr. Santimer, who was I believe at Oxford Lake or Island Lake, and gave up the work. He would I think take up the school at Hollow water River if the Dept asked Miss Ross to resign at the end of the month.\n\nMr. S. is a capable teacher, and the Rev. Mr. Simmons spoke to me about him, and we offered him this same school last Fall, but he had gone out to the coast, and could not then take it. As Mr. S. is a married man we could not ask him to go in there on $300 a year. Will the Dept place this school on the same footing as the others?\n\nI shall await your reply, and meanwhile try to get in touch with Mr. S.\n\nI have to thank you for you Re the Rev J.F.J.

The Department has no record of Mr. Santimer's qualifications although he taught for a short time at the Grass Lake school.

This school has been taught since last November without a day's vacation. By the Register I see that the annual vacation has been forgotten taken in October, November or December each year since 1887. The children and their parents think it time this year for a vacation as their children have attended without a day off during the spring and summer. May I give them a vacation now? Or should it be sooner? Please let me know officially at once.\n\nThere are no supplies for the school on hand as you will note by the enclosed requisition blank. The girl teaching evidently knew nothing of ordering supplies, and the school has been kept open but scarcely taught. Could you send us at once a few slate pencils, not ones here, and no scribbler pencils, rulers, erasers, pins or holders, copybooks, etc., and the few books on hand in letters, with slate pencils we may hold together until supplies are sent. There are blanks for Quarterly Report.\n\nWill you kindly see that Dr. Steep sends us a small supply of medicines at once. He evidently did not replace the medicines he used as there are none here and none have been received since last summer. I enclose a list of most necessary requirements in that line. Please have them sent in my name. How do I report Medical & Dentist supplies?\n\nEnclosed please find a receipt for tents.\n\nI will try and be in forefront to better the balance of supplies and very delayed goods. Will try again to get goods at Capt. Robinson and give an order on you or on the Dept.\n\nHome full of bedbugs and no sulphur or other insecticide. Take all our baby.\n\nHad a service yesterday. Does this house belong to the government or to Mr. Church, England? It has been refused by Indians.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have no advice on file showing that Miss Ross who was in charge of this school up to the time of Mr. Santmier's arrival there has been dismissed, nor have I any word of Mr. Santmier's appointment in her place, although in a former letter, I recommended that a change be made.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from the Department what is the status of Mr. Turner and Mr. Santmier.

If so does not the teacher have control of it for the protection of school materials at all times?\n\nIf it is the property of the Church of England what provision may be made for the protection of school material while the minute services are being held by Indians?\n\nIt might be well to state that I am a regularly ordained minister of a Christian Church and interested in the Indians welfare.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nArthur Savory\n\nIndian Affairs.

Yesterday the Bishop of Keratin occupied my schoolroom to the exclusion of the school for the greater part of the day without the formality of asking leave. He maintained that the school building belongs to the Church of England and that he holds the deed; that services may be held at any time without permission and if the school interferes with the services it may be closed by the Bishop, his representatives or the Councillor. Furthermore, that the government has no right to conduct school without either buying or renting the property and that he can at any time lock both the school building and the teachers dwelling upon the teacher.\n\nThese statements being in opposition to those of the Indian Office and being made before witnesses as\n\nIndian Affairs.

This lot is composed largely of high rocks and marsh and there are no buildings on it as nearly as I can tell.\n\nThe councillor, John Hardisty, informs me that in 1898 Mr. Coll, the Department's Commissioner, recommended the transfer to the new site where a small, surveyed plot was allotted by the Indians for the school building and one likewise for the teachers residence. Mr. Coll superintended the erection of the school building upon the new site. These plots, I should estimate, are from ten to fifteen yards in width and extend about one hundred yards, but there are no marks and no plat to go by.\n\nThere should be space reserved for a school garden and for a teachers garden as the soil is rich surrounding the buildings.\n\nThe teachers residence is in very poor condition being old and rotten and almost devoid of shingles. It is uninhabitable in summer in its present condition. There are no storm doors or windows and no water closet, store room, stable or wood house.\n\nThe school building is in fair condition but always somewhat in violent winds and has no entry and no storm doors or windows and is very old.\n\nBeing an ordained clergyman I accepted this school solely with the understanding that work of...\na missionary character was to be in my charge, especially Sunday services for Bible study. With this understanding my wife and I came at our own expense from Bridgeport, Connecticut to take this school. Outside of the salary of $50.00 as teacher our work is without remuneration from any source.

Our Inspector reports that Mr. Santimier had very fair success considering the indifference of the parents to the education of their children.\n\nThe Hollowater River School is conducted under the auspices of the Church of England and Mr. Santimier received his appointment from the Bishop of Keewatin, in whose diocese the school is situated, and I think the Department would not be justified in allowing any other religious body to take part in the work without the Bishop's consent.\nExtract from Report of John R.

G. O. Smith for this position.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this resignation is accepted and the Department approves of Mr. Smith's temporary appointment and will pay him at the rate of $400.00 per annum from the date that he takes charge. Kindly request Mr. Smith to advise the Agent when he takes up his duties. The grant will be paid to Your Lordship, as requested.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRight Rev. J.

Mr Samtiner is leaving there at the end of this month, and Mr Smith is going in there about the 20th instant.\n\nJ. Lofthouse\nBishop of Keewatin.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to thank you for your letter of the 14th inst.\n\nI have just heard from the Rev G.C. Smith who reached Hellow Water River on the 13th inst., and will begin school at once. Mr Santimer has not been teaching since the end of September.\n\nI note that you say \"The Department will pay at the rate of $400.00 per annum\" I would respectfully request that this school be placed on the same footing as the rest. I believe the Mr Santimer received $500.00 per A and Mr Smith received this at Palington, and I can see no reason why it should be reduced. We cannot keep decent teachers unless they are paid a decent Salary.\n\nBelieve me\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Keewatin.\nOttawa, October 23, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 19th instant in reference to the salary to be paid Rev. G. G. Smith at the Hollowwater River School.\n\nIn reply I would ask Your Lordship to state whether Mr. Smith is to give his whole time to the school work, or whether he will also be engaged as missionary on the reserve. If his time is to be given wholly to the school work and if he decides to stay for some length of time in charge of the school, the Department will be prepared to consider Your Lordship's request that the salary be $500.00 instead of $400.00. If, however, it is Mr. Smith's intention to stay only four or five months at the school, the Department is not disposed to increase the present allowance.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRight Rev.

I may say that Mr Smith is appointed Missionary at Hollow Water River with the understanding that the school is to be his first and most important work, he will therefore devote the same amount of time to the school as any other teacher, and will I trust remain there for some years at least. I hope therefore that the Dept will see its way to pay him at the same rate as other teachers.\n\nWe could not for a moment think of putting a Missionary at H.W.R. unless in conjunction with the school as the Band is not large enough to demand this, but combining the two we may I hope be sure of having a good teacher who will stay with the work.\n\nBelieve me Sincerely Yours.\n\nJ.

On investigation it was found necessary to have two jack-screws to raise the building so as to insert the new foundation. These jack-screws would cost about $12.00 or $14.00, could be loaned to this Band and be used for the benefit of the other Bands whose school foundation will have to be repaired in the future.\n\nI also estimate the cost of placing the foundation and other repairs to this school at about $75.00. (Labour)\n\nIf the Department is prepared to expend this expenditure, will you be good enough to advise at an early date, as I expect to visit this Reserve at the end of September and will endeavor to have this work performed as economically as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOTTAWA, Sept. 6th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo regarding repairs required to the Hollow Water River Indian Day School, and furnishing an estimate of the cost of placing the foundation and other repairs, and also requesting that you be granted authority to obtain two jack-screws to raise the building.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that it might be possible for you to arrange for the hire of two jack-screws for the time they would be required, but if this is not possible you may purchase the two jack-screws, the cost of which should not exceed the estimate submitted by you. If you find it necessary to purchase these, you will be good enough to see that when the work is performed at the school they are returned to your care, as you will be held responsible for them, and they can be used when we have future repairs to be made to our schools and agency buildings.\n\nYou should arrange to have the repairs required performed as soon as possible, and the cost should not exceed your estimate.

Cumming, Provincial Government School Inspector, Manitoba. The report is on the Hollow Water Indian Day School, and is anything but encouraging, and goes to show that it is only a waste of money employing teachers of this class in our Indian Schools.\n\nIt seems to me that there is no other course but for the Department to release Mr. Garrett from his duties, but then again, where would we get a teacher who would go out to a point like this and teach school. There is no accommodation for a qualified teacher, or any other teacher, and only men of Garrett's class would undertake such a duty.

Cumming, on his inspection of the Hollow Water Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that this report is not encouraging. The present Teacher, Mr. Leslie Garrett, began duties on May 23rd, last, and was appointed until the end of September next. As he will be discontinuing his services at that time, the school will likely not be re-opened, unless the church authorities make a strong demand for a teacher.\n\nThe needs of adequate accommodation for a teacher have been noted and will receive consideration when next year's estimates are being prepared.\n\nIt is noted that you have taken up with the agent the case of the young girl who was dying with consumption and which case was reported upon by Mr. Inspector Cumming.\n\nThe account for the inspector's services has been paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Unless you have some strong reason for continuing his services, the Department would be pleased if his activities ceased at the end of the present month.\n\nI am aware that it is extremely difficult to secure the services of a qualified teacher at this school, and I have caused to be noted for next year's estimates the need for adequate residential facilities at the Hollow Water Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Canon Lofthouse re Mr. Leslie Garrett temporary teacher at Hollow Water Indian Day School. I note that the Provincial Public School Inspector has reported that Mr. Garrett was meeting with no success in his work. May it not be that the Inspector was expecting overmuch from work extending over barely four months, if so long at the time of inspection, among children of the class on an Indian Reserve, after being without school for a considerable period. The fact that the attendance averaged, I understand, 30 during the summer, in spite of the well known difficulty in securing regularly attendance at Indian Day Schools, indicates some success in one respect, at any rate. I think it only fair to Mr. Garrett to call attention to these points. He completed his work the end of September and has returned to College in Toronto. I am trying to secure a suitable teacher to nominate, but have had several disappointments. I will advise as soon as I can.\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are of the opinion that a day school will be needed for this band for some time and the solution is a combined school and teacher's residence. The files might be examined or inquiry made from our representatives, with a view to ascertaining whether the day school and mission house are in any kind of repair.\n\nR. T.

Since he returned to college we have endeavoured to find a suitable person to occupy the mission and school, and although we have had some negotiations with possible candidates, we have not been successful in filling the vacancy.\n\nWe have learned today that we can again secure a suitable and qualified student for the summer. We should be pleased if the Department would sanction the appointment of this student as teacher of the above school for the summer as was done last year. The grant given at that time with bonus was at the rate of $90.00 per month, and it would be much appreciated if it is found possible to again make this grant.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Missionary & Secretary-Treasurer.\nOttawa, April 16, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, regarding the appointment of a teacher for the Hollow Water River Indian Day School during the coming summer. It is noted that you will be able to secure a suitable and qualified student to take charge of this school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will consent to the above arrangement being carried out, provided the teacher has the qualifications necessary for the work. The amount of salary allowed would depend on the qualifications of the applicant secured and, if he is fully competent to perform the duties, we would be prepared to allow the same rate as was paid last summer in the case of Mr. Leslie Garrett, viz.: $75 per month, supplemented by a bonus of $15 per month.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will furnish full particulars as to the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher secured by you and state the date upon which he will take up duties. This information is required as early as possible, in order that we can give due notice to our Indian Agent and make arrangements for commencing the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. Canon J. Lofthouse,\nSynod Office,\nKenora, Ont.\nThis is to state that Mr. A. H. Davis is a student in good standing of Wycliffe College. He is at present attending Extension Classes at the Jarvis Street Collegiate Institute in preparation for Honor Matriculation. The reports which have been coming to me during the past two years have been exceedingly good, lately the percentage gained in his class work, essays and examinations, has nearly always been above 75%, proving that he is above the average in point of mental strength and scholarship. Mr. Davis seems to have a particular aptitude for teaching and would, I believe, do exceedingly good work in the Indian School in which it is proposed that he should serve during the coming summer.\n\nPrincipal of Wycliffe College.\n\nApril 28th, 1923.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge with thanks your letter of the 18th, ult., No. 125-5-1 in reference to the appointment of a teacher for Hollow Water River Indian Day School.\n\nI note what you say re the amount of salary to be allowed, conditioned on the qualifications of the proposed teacher, to whose appointment you consent if such qualifications are satisfactory.\n\nOn receiving your letter I wrote to Dr. O\u2019Hare, the Principal of Wycliffe College, asking for the information required. I have today received the enclosed certificate which gives the name and qualifications of the applicant. I had hoped Mr. Davis might be able to take up the work about the middle of May, but I learn that he will not be free to do so until about the 10th of June. This would give him about three months of service, which I trust would be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nWe shall be pleased to learn from you as to whether Mr. Davis is acceptable to the Department for the position of teacher at the above school.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary-Treasurer.\nOttawa, May 8th, 1923.\n\nRev.

Davis as teacher of the Hollow Water River Indian Day School for the coming summer, and enclosing a certificate from Dr. O'Meara, the Principal of Wycliffe College, as to the qualifications which he possesses.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is considered that the services of Mr. Davis would be satisfactory as teacher for this school, and the Department will approve of his appointment. He should begin duties as early in June, next, as possible, and complete three months' service. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $75 per month, supplemented by bonus of $15 per month.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform Mr. Davis of his appointment, and arrange with him to take up duties as soon as his term at Wycliffe College for the present year closes. It might be well for him to call on the Agent on his way to the school, when he could receive information as to the present conditions, and with reference to the supplies, etc., on hand.\n\nWe are informing Mr. Agent Latulippe, Selkirk, Man., of the appointment of Mr. Davis, and requesting the Agent to give him every assistance he can in his work during the coming summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. Davis will likely take up duties about the 10th of June, next, and I have to request that you will give him every assistance you can in his work at this school. He will keep the school in operation for a period of three months. The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $75 per month, supplemented by bonus of $15 per month.\n\nShould any school material, stationery, etc., be required, Mr. Davis should prepare and forward a requisition to your office upon his arrival at the school.\n\nWe hope that the school building will be in a suitable condition to start the work, and that the equipment which was on hand will be available when Mr. Davis arrives.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform the Department of the date on which the school is opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I shall endeavour to have Mr. Davis call on Mr. Agent Latulippe at Selkirk if it can possibly be arranged. We usually send out workers for Hollow Water River by way of Fort Alexander, in order that the Rev. C. H.

H. Davis, gives up duties.\n\nMr. Harper is at present in receipt of salary at the rate of $500 per annum. We will grant him an increase of $100 on his removal to Hollow Water River, which will make his salary, from the date he begins duties at this school, at the rate of $600 per annum, which will be supplemented by any bonus provided by law.\n\nWe hope that Mr. Harper will meet with every success in his work at Hollow Water River. We are quite aware as to his faithfulness and devotion to duty, and, although he has limitations as a teacher, his transfer to Hollow Water River may, it is hoped, be in the best interests of all concerned. We have informed our Agent, Mr. H. O. Latulippe, Selkirk, Man., of approval being granted by yourself and the Department for the transfer of Mr. Harper.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will obtain a successor to Mr. Harper at the North St. Peter's School, and inform the Department of the qualifications and experience of the person secured.

I have this morning received a reply from him, in which he states that on account of his health not being very good at present he will not be able to accept the position.\n\nThis is somewhat of a disappointment as I announced to the people at the above point that he would probably come to take up the work this fall, and I felt certain that as Mr. Harper had expressed his willingness to make the transfer there would be no question as to his going in there.\n\nWe have a young man, Mr. L.V. Pocock who last spring wrote on the first year of the course in Arts at the University of Toronto. He desires to secure a situation for a year in order to finance his further university studies. He has been with us in mission work since the spring and has done very good work, and he now desires to secure a position as teacher; in fact he has been approached in regard to taking a position as teacher in a \"white\" school district.\n\nMr. Pocock would I feel sure accept the position as teacher at Hollow Water River for a year. I am writing him on the matter, and I should be pleased to know if the Department would approve of his appointment.

I found matters unsatisfactory both from a missionary and an educational point of view. I am therefore writing to ask that a change be made at the end of the current year. I am prepared to make a nomination for the position of teacher to take effect with your approval September, 1927. The Rev. E.W. Gardner has had long experience as a teacher. This winter he is teaching at York Factory and acting as locum tenens for Archdeacon Paries, now out on furlough. He is willing to undertake the work at Hollow Water River.\n\nThere is a necessary condition to the appointment of Rev. E.W. Gardner. He cannot live as Peter Harper is doing in the schoolroom where teaching is done, nor would the department wish him to do so or any other competent teacher. The need of proper accommodation for a teacher was recognized before Harper received the appointment for in a communication received from your Department, No.125-5-1, dated September 18th, 1926, your then Acting Asst. Deputy & Secretary, A.F. MacKenzie, wrote, \"I am aware that it is extremely difficult to secure the services of a qualified teacher at this school, and I have caused to be noted for next year's estimates the need for adequate residential facilities at the Hollow Water Indian Day School.\" In view of this past proposed action I trust that provision will now be made to provide such equipment next year that a proper appointment may be made.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nMost faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We will do what we can to induce the Indians to do the rough labour gratis; but, as you are doubtless aware, it is customary to find rations for men doing work of that kind as they cannot do that and get their supplies in the usual way.

E. W. Gardner's appointment to the Hollow Water River Indian Day School.

Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. A. D. Dewdney, D.D.,\nBishop of Keewatin,\nBishopstowe,\nKenora, Ont.\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nRev. R.W. Gardner arrived at Hollow Water River Reserve to take up the work as Missionary Teacher on September 20th and has since been in residence. He has found it impossible to begin actual teaching work until Monday last, Oct. 14th, when he expected to open school. In a letter of the 10th inst., he goes somewhat fully into the condition of things in consequence of which he could not begin actual teaching. He says there was scarcely a sound desk and the greater number were badly broken and beyond repair. Bolts have gone from the stoves, screws also were needed. These he had sent away for as advised by the Agent, but they had not arrived. Storm windows had been provided for the school but had not been fitted. This he has done himself with voluntary assistance. He states that the schoolhouse is well built but there are no water closets for the scholars. School supplies are also needed and these he is applying for, I understand, through the Agent.\n\nWith regard to qualifications, Mr. Gardner received his training in Newfoundland where he taught for a number of years. He has taught several years at the school in York Factory and several years also at Churchill for which the Department sent some school supplies, though the school was never put on your list. He has shown special fitness for teaching work. I shall be glad to hear from you as to the amount of salary that will be allowed him. This had better be sent as hitherto to Canon Lofthouse at our Synod Office here. I presume that in view of the work he has had to do to get the school ready for its use that he will be entitled to his salary from the Department from the date of his arrival.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nMost faithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Gardner arrived at Hollow Water River Indian Day School on September 20th; but, as there was considerable preparation before school could be opened, classes did not commence on this date. However, I shall see that his salary is paid from the date of his arrival on the reserve and will arrange that prompt attention is paid to requisitions which he forwards through the office of the Indian Agent. As Rev. Mr. Gardner is missionary teacher, I believe salary at the rate of $75 per teaching month would be a fair remuneration to offer. This will be paid to Your Lordship's office, as formerly in the case of this school. I may say that, if Mr. Gardner dispenses medicines, he will receive an annual grant of $50 for the extra activity.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Gardner seems to have done a very good work with the children attending the school and at a meeting the people spoke highly of the splendid way in which the children had come along in their use of English. Unfortunately, Rev. Gardner has suffered seriously with his eyes and he will leave the mission this summer. I have secured as successor a qualified teacher holding Ontario Second Class Certificate who is also a candidate for the ministry and he is prepared to take up the missionary school work at this point in the fall. I am therefore nominating Mr. Batteau, at present teaching at Steeles Public School, Ontario, as teacher to begin work after the Summer Holidays, 1st of September. As the accommodation for living quarters for a man with wife and two young children in the new school house is not sufficient I am asking the Department through you to allow me the use of the old school building until we propose to fix up for a residence at the expense of the Church.\n\nBy using the two rooms of the school residence with cellar...\nthe three rooms into which we propose to divide\nmy old building will make ample accommodation.\nWill you kindly take up the matter with the pro-\nper authority in the Department and inform\nmy Commissary, Arch.

It is presumed that Mr. Cathcart will begin his duties as teacher at the beginning of the next school year, or about September 4th, next. We are informing Mr. Agent Stevenson of the appointment of Mr. Cathcart.\n\nHis Lordship requests that, owing to there being insufficient accommodation in the teacher's residence in connection with the new school building for Mr. Cathcart and his family, the Church authorities be allowed the use of the old school building, which they propose to fit up at the expense of the Church.

Canon J. Lofthouse, Kenora. Only Mr. Harper's salary for the December quarter at Hollowwater, namely $180.00 was sent to Rev. Canon Lofthouse on January 14th, last. Possibly, Canon Lofthouse has already remitted this amount to Mr. Harper and, if not, Mr. Harper should apply to him. The bonus for the December quarter, amounting to $45.00, was sent addressed to him at Manitobogan on the 16th ultimo and should have reached him by this time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

This practice was discontinued as from April 1st but your salary was increased $150.00, an amount equivalent to the bonus. Your salary for the June quarter was net $180.00, as heretofore, but amounted to $225.00 and a cheque was directed to Rev. Canon Lefthouse, of Kenora. Your salary is now at the rate of $75.00 a teaching month and cheques will be sent direct to Kenora promptly on the receipt of your quarterly reports.\n\nI note you asked the agent to have your September cheque, which amounted to $75.00, directed to Selkirk. This is being mailed today to Rev. Canon Lefthouse, thus conforming to the previous arrangement.\n\nMight I suggest that you look to Rev. Canon Lefthouse for advances on your salary at this time of the year when you are outfitting yourself for the winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

The reason is that we pay all salaries quarterly whether the Department cheques are to hand or not. This has proved entirely satisfactory in all other cases, but it would perhaps be advisable for me to send on Mr. Harper's cheque at the time I receive it and thus avoid these misunderstandings.\n\nTrusting this explanation is satisfactory,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary-Treasurer.\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL WAGE OR SALARY | AMOUNT DUE |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----------------------|------------|\n| Peter Harper    | HOLLOWATER RIVER | $750.00               | $225.00   |\n\nMake ck. payable and send to:-\nCanon J.

E. W. Gardner arrived at Hollow Water River Indian Day School on September 20th; but, as there was considerable preparation before school could be opened, classes did not commence on this date. However, I shall see that his salary is paid from the date of his arrival on the reserve and will arrange that prompt attention is paid to requisitions which he forwards through the office of the Indian Agent. As Rev. Mr. Gardner is missionary teacher, I believe salary at the rate of $75 per teaching month would be a fair remuneration to offer. This will be paid to Your Lordship's office, as formerly in the case of this school. I may say that, if Mr. Gardner dispenses medicines, he will receive an annual grant of $50 for the extra activity.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

Ed. Thomas reported that the new schoolhouse which was erected on the Hollow Water River Reserve under his supervision is completed and handed in his accounts, but it was found that they were not complete inasmuch as they were not supported by receipts for the wages paid by him. As the appropriation from which these vouchers are to be paid will soon lapse, and it is impossible to obtain those receipts within the time owing to the distant location of this Reserve, I therefore thought it best to put the vouchers through in their present shape. Mr. Thomas has returned to Hollow Water River and has promised to send these receipts, which will be transmitted to the Department as soon as received.\n\nMeantime, if cheques can be issued, I would ask that they be sent to this Office to be held pending the receipt of the receipts.\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, 10th July, 1898.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 7th instant,\nand the numbers Nos 15 and 16 therewith enclosed, I beg\nto draw your attention to an error in the third item of\nMessrs Robinson & Co's account.

F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast week-end I visited Hollow Water River, spending Sunday and Monday there. I found the school building in good condition, but the teacher's residence is very much in need of repair; there are leaks in the roof between the kitchen and the main building, and the joints of the logs will have to be re-plastered before the house can be used for the winter.\n\nI have written to Mr. Peter Harper in reference to his transfer to the school at this point, and have suggested that he should endeavour to move as early as possible in order that he may have time to repair the house before the winter comes.\n\nWould it be possible for the Department to make a grant of say $50.00 for necessary repairs. The mission house is the only possible place for the teacher to stay, and it must be repaired for the winter. We should be grateful if the Department can assist us in the matter of repairs.\n\nYours very Faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary-Treasurer.\nOttawa, August 28th, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to the Hollow Water River Indian Day School.
