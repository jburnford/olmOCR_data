The latter region has doubtless been destitute of timber from the first; whilst the true prairie country, or Fertile Belt, was probably at one time a dense forest. It naturally inclines to produce timber; and where a prairie escapes the yearly fires for any length of time it speedily becomes overgrown with vigorous young aspens and willows. In such regions the process of alternate prairie and forest making may be constantly observed, fire being the great factor on one hand, and natural tendency on the other. The prairie soils, it may hence be inferred, are peculiarly rich in nitrates and phosphates, those great nourishers of plant life, and it is from these virgin regions that America must ultimately draw its supply of wheat.\nCARSCADEN,\nPECK & CO.,\nMANUFACTURERS OF\nCLOTHING\nHats, Caps, Fur Goods\nAnd Men's Furnishings\nWHOLESALE.\n\nManufactory\u2014622 St. Lawrence Main Street, Montreal.\nWarehouses\u2014Cor.

Every tenth year, it has been said, lops off an American wheat exporting state; and it is easy to forecast the value which must in a few years attach to our own areas of unused land in a climate which, with all its drawbacks of a rigorous winter and occasional droughts, produces wheat in the highest perfection. Indeed, the growth of hard wheat may be said to be almost confined to our Northwest, a fact whose economic value it is difficult to over-estimate. It is only within recent years that the facts with regard to our wheat producing area have become patent. Lying away from the great paths of trade and population, and jealously secluded from settlement, the wheat belt for a long time was looked upon by the outside world solely as a fur-bearing region. As a matter of fact, it is but a few years since wheat was first grown to any extent on the Saskatchewan, and the whole history of the cultivation of the plant, even in Red River Settlement, lies within the compass of a lifetime. Nevertheless, the early discoverers and explorers were not without a knowledge of the wheat growing resources of the Northwest; and it will perhaps surprise many a reader to learn that wheat was grown by French farmers upon the Saskatchewan long before the Conquest. Had that overturn, indeed, not taken place, there can be no doubt that Seignories would have been established throughout the Northwest in the last century, and that a line of French Canadian Censitaires would have extended long ago along the banks of its principal rivers.\nF.

It is said that he ascended the river to its forks, and thence followed up the north branch to the present site of Prince Albert, where he established a post, placing it on one of the islands opposite the present town, for security doubtless against attack by the savages. Numerous old Indian graves attest that the Prince Albert flat must in early days have been a meeting place of the Indians, owing no doubt to its easy landings and to its large area of camping ground; but more perhaps to its central situation, for the Indians had a keen eye to convenience, and their ancient rallying points are invariably the sites of the white men's cities of to-day.\n\nThese features, no doubt, commended the spot to the subsequent founder of the Mission of Prince Albert in 1866, the late Mr. Nisbett, around whose farm has extended within recent years what is now the well-known capital of Saskatchewan.\n\nMilling facilities, the primary requisites of every new settlement, were added in 1874, and other mills followed, with so speedy an increase of population and industries that had any outlet been furnished for surplus productions, a large export trade would have been developed. But railways being withheld, production naturally languished, and was confined to the supply of local demand.

The production of wheat increased three hundred fold in a single year. But the railway scheme fell through, and with it the farmer's hopes. His surplus proved to be a burden rather than a blessing, and lack of storage and a market led to the waste of much valuable grain. Since then production has done little more than keep pace with local demand. Farmers have turned their attention more to stock-raising than to wheat, and not a bushel of Saskatchewan grain has ever found an eastern market. Yet even the local trade, engendered by a large settlement, has been the means of wonderful progress. The settlers of Prince Albert are perhaps better housed than any others in the Territories; schools are established in all directions, and the town has grown to large proportions. Many places depend upon railways either for their origin or advancement. But Prince Albert is a natural centre of trade and industry, and\u2014though 500 miles west of Winnipeg\u2014and\nTHE SANDERSON CO.\n\nSaw, Planing, Lath and Shingle MILLS,\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, SASKATCHEWAN.\n\nAll kinds of Lumber at reduced rates.\nStock of Lath and Shingles constantly on hand\nSpecial quotations to Builders and Settlers\n\nTHE SANDERSON COMPANY.\n\nwithout any outlet or adventitious aid it has yet grown rapidly, and has long been a distributing centre. The advent of the railway now under construction, and of which it is the terminus, is certain to build it into a city, and, with the completion of railway connection with Hudson's Bay, it will, by virtue of its situation, undoubtedly become a place of commanding importance. It may be described as occupying at once the middle distance of the Fertile Belt, and of a great continental river\u2014the Saskatchewan\u2014outrivalling, as regards the extent and value of the country it drains, the St. Lawrence itself. To the south and to the northwest the Shell River country, a magnificent farming region as yet entirely unoccupied; and, of equal importance, to the north and northeast, the true forests of the country which skirt the shores of lakes vaster than Erie or Ontario, and divided by occasional marshy stretch in broken yet gigantic masses almost to Hudson's Bay. Prince Albert will be the point of departure from the great wheat belt for tide water; for, though five hundred miles' northwest of Winnipeg, it is yet nearer Churchill than that city, and Churchill is the true harbor of Hudson's Bay. The largest ocean vessels can sail directly into the Churchill river, which, by a narrow entrance, encloses as commodious\nTHE\n\nAMES, HOLDEN CO.

No lightering is required, and this significant fact will, when impending developments have taken place, very speedily extinguish York Factory, Port Nelson and all other rivals on the western main as points of shipment for the grain of the Saskatchewan. One or more comparatively short lines of rail will yet carry the largest proportion of the wheat of the Fertile Belt from Prince Albert to Churchill, where the cars will be unloaded directly into the ocean steamers. The remainder may go by way of the Great Lakes, for presumably, Churchill is a summer port only, though this is by no means certain. But when the reader considers that Prince Albert is as near Liverpool as the City of Toronto, that it is the middle distance of one of the largest rivers in America; that it is situate just where the prairie ends, and the true forests begin, he will readily understand that conditions so grouped must be of enormous importance in the future, that the triumph of economic law will be a mere question of time, and that the cereals of this country will, and must, find their way to England by the shortest, and, therefore, by the cheapest route.\n\nReturn freight will be had in goods and immigrants from Europe, and in lumber manufactured at various points along the line, which will run through a valuable timber country almost its entire length. At present the settlement of Prince Albert is supplied with lumber sawn by mills in the town; from timber cut along the river, and at Sturgeon Lake, some twenty miles north, whence the logs are floated down to the mills. The settlement proper comprises that part of the peninsula formed by the north and south branches of the Saskatchewan, which lies betwixt two deep belts of fir fifty miles apart, and which trend across the penin-\nTHOS.

The predatory grasshopper has never done any injury throughout the immense area inclosed by these two belts of evergreen timber and the two rivers; though since the culture of cereals began in the settlement, six crops have at various times been partially or totally destroyed in Minnesota, and in the old Red River Settlement in Manitoba. This is a very important fact in the history of Prince Albert in the opinion of men who have witnessed with their own eyes, the frequent ravages of the insect elsewhere, and their deplorable consequences. As the locusts have devastated almost at stated intervals, both our own and the American Northwest, so will they visit and destroy again; and the fact is worth consideration that in the very centre of the Fertile Belt there exists a vast area of fertile land, which for unknown reasons enjoys special immunity from attack. Many here are of opinion that the two belts of timber referred to should be reserved by Government and preserved as a permanent barrier against the worst, and indeed almost the only enemy of the farmer in the Northwest. The boundaries of Prince Albert settlement, as thus defined, enclose something like a million acres of exceedingly fertile land. The soil is mainly argillaceous, with superficial deposits of vegetable mould varying in depth from twelve inches to four feet. The clay is whitish when dry and is made into excellent bricks at Prince Albert. The vegetable deposit is more or less mixed with sand, and is very porous, clean and easily worked. The glairy and almost impassable mud of Manitoba is unknown here, and excepting the sloughs which traverse the highways, one can travel dry-shod immediately after the snow has melted.\nBAKER ESTATE\n\u2014 IN THE \u2014\nBUSINESS CENTRE\n\u2014 OF THE \u2014\nTown of Prince Albert!\n500\nChoice Building Lots!\nFOR SALE.\n\nPurchasers can make arrangements for the erection of buildings on easy terms of payment.

The country, too, is hilly and therefore picturesque, though the hills are all cultivable, and not a stone is to be seen anywhere away from the banks of the river, where the boulders are found from which the lime burners draw their supply. Out crops of limestone are spoken of, however, which may yet supply the district with building materials of the best quality. The prairie has an added charm in the beautiful groves of aspen, which extend here and there through the valleys and over the hills, and in the abundance of small but refreshing ponds or lakelets, one of which is almost certain to be found in every settler's \"park.\" But the great features of Prince Albert settlement are its two noble rivers, the North and South Saskatchewan, here only eighteen miles apart. These magnificent streams, which rise in the Rocky Mountains and are fed by melting snows and glaciers in that great range, after a career of 500 miles unite about thirty-five miles below Prince Albert, between precipitous and almost mountainous banks. Thence the river carries its intermingled floods 500 miles further, widening in its lower reaches into vast wildernesses of almost unexplored lakes\u2014a sea rather than a river\u2014and after a terrible riot over Grand Rapids drops smoothly into the great Lake Winnipeg, as long though not as wide as Lake Superior, and connected by Nelson River with Hudson's Bay. In winter the water of both branches of the Saskatchewan is as clear as crystal, but as soon as spring opens it becomes highly colored with alluvium washed from its banks. Both rivers rise with the increasing heat of summer, there being three marked freshets\u2014in spring, in June and in August. This is owing, of course, to their sources lying in the multitudinous snows and glaciers of the mountains,\nIMPORTANT\nTo the Travelling Public and intending Settlers.\n\nJ. M.

CAMPBELL.\nand consequently they differ greatly from rivers which have their origin in the prairie, and depend upon seasonable rain for their summer supply. The Saskatchewan differs in other respects from what may be called local and inland streams. It is \"continental\" in its mighty resources and natural importance. There are but four rivers in North America east of the Rocky Mountains, which may justly be called continental, and the Saskatchewan is one of the four. It is important therefore that such a river should receive attention at the hands of Parliament. Millions of money have been spent on the improvement of the St. Lawrence, and millions more are required to make it what it may yet be and ought to be\u2014a highway for ocean-going vessels to the head of Lake Superior, for the St. Lawrence flows in the right direction for trade. But so does the Saskatchewan. It also flows eastward, and its natural resources and productions, coal and cereals, which cannot endure a costly transport, may yet be carried cheaply by its current, as on the Danube, in flat boats, which any farmer can build, while the manufactures of the east, which can stand heavier charges must be carried against it. But though millions have been and still are required for the improvement of the St. Lawrence, millions are not required for the Saskatchewan. Twenty thousand pounds properly expended upon the river would greatly facilitate transport and get rid of the worst obstructions to navigation. An expenditure of thrice this sum would probably make a river 1,500 miles long, navigable from its discharge almost to its fountains. Reference has already been made to the wheat of Prince Albert, which, it is needless to say is of the best quality. Oats and barley are the other grains cultivated and yield largely. Barley, in fact, is a \"weed\" in the Northwest. It yields \"volunteer crops\" as they are called, and is almost as\nREAL ESTATE.\n\n$150,000\n\nWorth of the most desirable Real Estate in the North West Territories is now being offered at Prices that will enable all to become Part Proprietors of the\n\nCHICAGO OF CANADA.\n\nBUILDING LOTS AND CHOICE VILLA LOTS.\n\nLots suitable for Warehouses or Lumber Yards, either on River Front or on Line of R. & L.

This difficulty is not discreditable to the soil, of course, and is due altogether to slovenly cultivation and the irrepressible energies of the \"king o' grain.\" Roots and vegetables mature perfectly and excellent tomatoes have been grown and ripened, but demand more care than in the east. Mandan corn\u2014the parent or aboriginal corn\u2014ripens, but the tender and improved eastern varieties do not. The wild plum and grape are not found on the Saskatchewan, though doubtless both would thrive if transplanted; but all other wild fruits usually found in the eastern provinces grow abundantly, and are superior to their congenors in the east. The low-bush cranberry certainly is, as it is full to bursting of a mild sub-acid juice which is often made into a very palatable beer in the settlement. The winter climate is certainly much more agreeable than that of Manitoba. It is not windy in winter, and there is an entire absence of \"blizzards.\" The snow is seldom deep, and the falls are not frequent, the winter weather being generally brilliantly clear and exhilarating. The summer climate is simply delightful. Being in a higher latitude than Manitoba the daylight is longer and one can easily read small type by natural light at ten o'clock at night in the end of June. This lengthened sunshine also contributes to the ripening of grain; the quality of wheat varies inversely as to the distance from the northern limit of its growth. Frost sometimes attacks it, as in that province, in seasons when the spring has been late and seeding protracted. But frost need not deter the immigrant from coming here. This is indisputably a wheat growing country, and an occasional frost is what has visited every new settlement in every Province of the Dominion. The June frosts, for example, which do so much damage in Ontario, are unknown at Prince\nWM. TAIT,\nLive Stock Dealer,\nPRINCE ALBERT.

This is a very important fact and should be borne in mind when frosts in this country are spoken of. They occur in the latter part of August when a \"break\" more or less decided generally takes place in the weather. There is a marked and sudden decline in the temperature. The nights become chilly and repressive, and frost is \"feared,\" at this time though it does not generally come. Early sowing therefore is important and an early variety of wheat which, it seems likely, will be developed in the country itself. But though an early variety of wheat is important, diligence on the part of the farmer is more important still. When a frost does occur it is our best farmers who suffer least, and sometimes not at all.\n\nOf the extensive region lying between the two rivers, and which has been briefly described, a considerable portion has been taken up. But the immigrants with means who wish to purchase improved farms can do so at very low figures almost in any part of the peninsula adjacent to Prince Albert. Many of the pioneer settlers are willing to sell their claims at the upset price and bare value of improvements in order to acquire a second homestead, and, with the capital obtained by the sale of the first, stock and cultivate the second to better advantage.\n\nNor need the intending immigrant confine his destinies to Prince Albert settlement alone. There are adjacent districts quite as worthy of his notice so far as land is concerned. The Paywanan and Fort a la Corne country is of a fine character. Particularly so is the Stony Creek and Carrot River region where many families are already comfortably settled upon lands of a rich character. This is also a great hay region,\nand promises to be a very fine and flourishing district when developed. But of all the localities tributary to Prince Albert perhaps the most inviting is that known as the Shell River country, which lies north-west of the Saskatchewan, a region which is to be surveyed and opened up for settlement this summer, and which is within easy reach of the town by a good trail. It is drained by a beautiful gravelly stream of clear water bordered by the most luxuriant hay meadows in the country. The whole region is interspersed with clumps of spruce of good growth, furnishing an abundant supply of building timber of the best quality. Clear lakes, generally abounding in fish are numerous; game is abundant, and the quality of the soil itself all that could be desired. Indeed it would be difficult to exaggerate the interesting features of this beautiful region which is of great extent, and is entirely unoccupied as yet by settlers, and untouched by the speculator, or the landed corporation. The reserves of the Hudson's Bay Company end with the North Branch of the Saskatchewan; colonization companies have no footing here; no railway reserves have been established, and therefore the immigrant will find in this region a fair field with no interested speculator to stand betwixt him and his patent.\n\nNorth and east of this region lie the great lakes of the Saskatchewan, to which reference has been made, some of which are of immense size and all of which abound with trout, pike and whitefish which will be a permanent supply for home and for export if properly preserved.\n\nThere are other resources known to exist in the Fertile Belt which,\nJ.

Coal abounds on the North Saskatchewan, and a valuable measure exists within four miles of the town of Prince Albert. Judging by the exposure of the bed and by borings made back from the river bank, this is evidently a very extensive seam, and will soon be a valuable and convenient source of supply to the capital of the District. Evidences towards Sturgeon Lake, some twenty miles to the north, indicate the neighborhood of Prince Albert as a great coal-bearing region; gold is found in the river and there are probably other mineral deposits in the north which will doubtless yet prove to be of economic value. But the future of Prince Albert and the Fertile Belt does not depend upon minerals even if they exist in any quantity, which is doubtful, since it is not a mountainous but a farming country. The two conditions do not generally consist. British Columbia, for instance, is a country of mountains and minerals, but it is justly discredited as a farmer's province. If a man could live on scenery alone all would be well with him there, but men must eat in order to live; and British Columbia is a region not for the poor man but for the rich syndicate and the capitalist. On the other hand the poorest man can come to Prince Albert and if he have energy and perseverance can speedily build up a comfortable home for himself and family; for, as was fittingly remarked by one of the speakers at the banquet given to Lieut-Governor Royal by the citizens of Prince Albert last summer, \"here seem to be brought together by the hand of nature the three great desiderata of the farmer, land, wood and water; land upon whose bosom has withered the enriching and procreant vegetation of centuries; land which drops fatness as if in the fulfilment of prophecy, at once generous and abundant, and more durable than its tiller.\" By\nBANKING HOUSE\n\nMacarthur & Knowles,\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, SASK.\n\nTransact a General Banking Business.

The compilers do not here include the educational and religious institutions now established. These are of such an extent as to demand a separate article, which will, perhaps, be an agreeable surprise to the reader who thinks of making this country his home.\n\nThere are two large flour mills, one a roller mill, in full working order, and the other in process of construction. There are three saw mills one of which can work off 50,000 feet per diem and the other two probably as much more. In connection with these there are sash and door factories, so that all requirements for the present are easily met. Three doctors and five lawyers represent the legal and medical profession. There are a brick courthouse and gaol, a resident judge, sheriff, etc., Dominion Lands agent, Crown Timber agent, Homestead Inspector and several other officials, and here too is a strong detachment of the Mounted Police whose barracks occupy a commanding situation, and are the finest, with the exception of those at Regina, in the Territories. There are two newspapers, both of which are well conduct-\ned sheets; several hotels, a bank, brewers, bakers, auctioneers, druggists, brickmakers, butchers, blacksmiths\u2014in fact representatives of all the trades\u2014and some ten or twelve general merchants. Prince Albert is incorporated and taxation is low. Building lots have, so far, been sold at very reasonable rates, prices varying from $25 to $400 each according to situation.

The country tributary to the North Saskatchewan has long been considered as unsurpassed in general excellence by any other portion of the West. Travellers through that distant region have invariably returned with the most enthusiastic reports about the country, and some declare that there is no part of the great West to compare with it. It is generally described as a beautiful country to look upon, and has the advantages of abundance of wood and water. The fact that important settlements have existed for years at several points on the North Saskatchewan, would alone indicate that the country must have great natural advantages. It would require more than the ordinary advantages to draw settlers to those distant regions; long in advance of railway communication.\u2014Winnipeg Commercial.\n\nA GRAND VALLEY, THE SASKATCHEWAN\u2014ANOTHER VALUABLE OPINION\n\nThrough there was laid down the original line of the C.P.R., and the pioneers who went there expecting that line, which was afterwards diverted, have never regretted their choice.\n\nNow that two or more lines are making through that rich section; before long we may expect a tide of immigration settling in there. It is a rolling country well dotted with clumps of wood, some of large extent, and fully supplied with good water. It is both a grain and a cattle country and is not liable to severe storms and change of climate. The country is beautiful in its general appearance and well adapted to occupation by people of varied tastes. Besides the general settlement of the country, there are several towns already in it with all the attributes of active business centres and only needing close and rapid connection with the outside world to become very important.\u2014Colonist.\n\nPrince Albert will have this connection during the present season. Practical men should see the advantages of making their locations or investments at once.\n\nThe sportsman and the tourist will find within our borders all the keenest could desire. Game of all kind in abundance, and scenery which has already excited the admiration of the English and Canadian explorer.\nSTATEMENTS\n\nFROM A PRACTICAL FARMER.\n\nThe following remarks have special reference to that portion of the Saskatchewan valley extending say fifty miles east and a like distance west of Prince Albert and from twenty miles north to fifty miles south of that town. This area comprises 7,000 square miles, of which a part is under wood and water, but much the greater portion is land well suited for agriculture and stock raising and consists largely of still unoccupied virgin soil. Through the heart of this fine region flow two large navigable rivers, between which the Qu'Appelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan railway is now being built right into the town of Prince Albert. The prospective advantages of this almost unique combination of rail and river accommodation give an exceptionally favorable character to this area, which embraces within its bounds large tracts well fitted for agriculture and other tracts equally suitable for stock raising, while the bulk of the land is specially adapted for mixed farming, in which branch the great majority of the present settlers are engaged\u2014experience having proved it to be safe, profitable and advantageous.\n\nSpeaking generally, the actual farmers are in comfortable circumstances and if every individual settler has not been equally successful, this will not surprise those who know how every new country attracts to itself all kinds, conditions and characters of men. Hitherto there have been great impediments to the progress of the settlement, arising from the state of isolation and consequent limitation to a small local market to which the absence of railway connection has condemned the producing class, thus retarding development and checking expansion. But notwithstanding every disadvantage, it must be allowed that for those farmers who to the necessary skill have added steady industry, the result\nJ. O.

That such a result has been achieved in the face of all the disadvantages accruing from long continued isolation very clearly shows the value of the natural resources of the district and fully justifies that faith in the future which is held by the settlers, as well as the most certain assurance that as soon as the advent of railway connection has removed its greatest disabilities, this settlement will advance\n\nBY LEAPS AND BOUNDS.\n\nIt is between twenty and thirty years since the first settlers took up land near what is now the town of Prince Albert and most of the present settlers have been resident from six to sixteen years and upwards, a length of time which has amply sufficed to prove that both agriculture and stock-raising are successful and profitable occupations here.\n\nWith regard to agriculture, it may be said the methods of cultivation and machinery in use are the same as in other parts of the country. There is no system of rotation in general use, and summer fallowing is increasingly practiced with good results. Spring wheat is grown, winter varieties not suiting the climate. Since 1885 \"red Fyfe\" has been chiefly\nGRAND UNION\n\nLivery and Feed Stables!\n\nNext Door to Queen's Hotel, Prince Albert.\n\nS. J.

All these varieties have done well, of course varying in yield with varying seasons. It is considered desirable to refrain from making a statement in figures as to the average yield per acre. This, at the best, would be but an approximation, there being no provision for collecting crop statistics throughout the district. As has been said, seasons vary, and besides this so much that is unreliable is published about averages year after year that practical men are not to be blamed for looking askance at figures which sometimes represent so much and mean so little. Judging, however, from personal experience in wheat growing over a number of years and observations made on such sections of the district as it has been possible to examine carefully, and comparing all this with the most reliable data obtainable from other quarters, a general conclusion has been reached that on an average of years the wheat raised in this district will favorably compare both as to quantity and quality with that grown in any other locality in the North West Territories. Of course the success or failure of agricultural operations is largely dependent on weather conditions everywhere and no\nPrince Albert, the Hub of Saskatchewan.\n\nD. C.

As far back as history extends there were years of plenty and years of dearth even in those regions most favored by nature. So it has continued to be and so it is now and it is not to be expected the Northwest Territories are exempt from conditions common to all the world. In this part of the Northwest which is entirely removed from the region of cyclones and tornadoes, the weather conditions which chiefly concern the agriculturist are the rainfall and early frosts. In the history of the district there have been dry years and wet years, but excessive departures from the normal condition of a happy medium have been the exception not the rule, and neither in the direction of drought nor wetness have there been such extremes as cause a total failure in any one year, although there have been such fluctuations as are covered by the difference between a bountiful yield and a poor crop. The older settlers report that from 1876 to 1883 the winter snows were deeper and more rain usually fell in the spring and early summer than has been the case since\u2014the crops were heavy and it seemed to matter little what style of cultivation was adopted. Since 1884 the seasons have been on the whole drier, two of them approaching actual drought. During these drier years the average yield has been lighter, although improving hus-\nT. J.

It is the opinion of many that wet and dry seasons in this part of the Territories at least run in cycles of about seven years duration. However this may be, the past winter (1889-90) has been marked by a much heavier snow fall than any other winter for the period named. This heavier fall, in itself a benefit, is regarded by many natives and settlers as the forerunner of another cycle of moist years and prolific crops. On the other important weather subject, early frost, it is necessary to offer a remark or two. Local observations continued for a number of years, compared with the experiences of other localities on this and the other side of the line, lead to the conviction that in no degree is this district worse off in respect of early frost than other settlements in the Territories, Manitoba and the North-western States. Except in 1887, which was an unusually late season, there has been little or no damage by frost to the wheat crop here in recent years; and the belief is confidently held, that with the more general settlement of the country, progressive agricultural methods, and close attention and\nHURD ESTATE\n\nFOR SALE:\n\n300 CHOICE LOTS!\n\nIN THE BUSINESS CENTRE OF\n\nThe Town of Prince Albert\n\nSome of the Leading Business Houses, the Town Hall, Telegraph Office and Printing Office are located on this property.\n\nEASY TERMS. \u2014 TORRENS TITLE.\n\nCorrespondence Solicited.\n\nJ.

Even now this is not so much of a bugbear as it once was. The frost, from which crops in later seasons occasionally suffer, recurs with considerable regularity and but little variation in date, and will be, in the long run, more effectually provided against than if its occurrence were more erratic.\n\nWith regard to the cultivation of oats and barley, it has only to be said that these grains are raised here just as easily and with as good results as anywhere else, as practical men will easily understand from what has been said on wheat growing. Hitherto six-rowed or four-rowed has been grown, but the attention which in other parts of the Dominion is being directed towards the future production of two-rowed barley for export has not been unnoted here. Samples have already been grown with good results and were the Hudson's Bay outlet an accomplished fact, as much fine barley could be grown in the Saskatchewan Valley alone as would supply the whole requirements of Britain.\n\nFrom these details on the growth of cereals farmers will be prepared\nHUDSON'S BAY CO'Y\n\nKeep in stock at their East and West End Shops an Extensive Stock of\n\nMERCHANDISE!\n\nComprising the Finest Lines in\n\nDry Goods, Millinery, Mantles,\nReady Made Clothing, Hats and Caps,\nGentlemen's Furnishings, Fur Goods,\nGloves, Jewellery, Boots and Shoes,\nHardware, Stoves, Farm Machinery,\nGroceries, Canned Goods, Dry Fruits,\nFresh Fruits, Flour and Feed,\nSalt Fish, Finest Breakfast Spiced Roll,\nClearside Bacon, Sugar Cure Hams,\nDairy Produce, Farm and Garden Produce.\n\nWe purchase in large quantities for cash.\n\nWe sell at wholesale prices in any quantity for cash\n\nGoods not in Stock will be ordered by Telegraph.\nfor the statement that agricultural roots are cultivated most successfully. Potatoes, turnips, carrots, mangold and beet are sure crops. They all yield well; are in quality second to none and particularly free from disease or damage from insects. Garden vegetables do well, and are more or less grown by farmers.\n\nEnough has probably been said to enable men of skill and experience to judge accurately of the agricultural capabilities of this district, and it remains to offer a few remarks on stock-raising and its concomitants. Horse-breeding is universal, but, as a separate industry, is still in embryo, and though an occasional good horse has been imported by one or two enterprising men, there is yet great room for improvement. The prices which good, first class \"general purpose\" horses command here will make the breeding of this class highly profitable in future. Regarding cattle, which, under the prevalent system of mixed farming, are kept and reared by all farmers throughout the settlement, it may be said that though many of the animals are still scrubby and middle class grades, there has been more than a beginning made in rearing better class stock. Quite a few energetic settlers have brought in thoroughbreds, chiefly Shorthorns, in recent years, but the result is becoming apparent in the improved character of their herds. Butter is made in considerable quantity, and where sound methods and proper care are the rule, the product is equal to the best. Cheese is made by only a few and in limited quantities, and there has not so far been any attempt to introduce the creamery or cheese factory systems, although looking to the great natural adaptability of the district, this modern style of dairying has undoubtedly a great future before it. Beef animals are raised with little trouble or expense; they are usually rolling fat on the natural summer pastures and natural hay, and the straw-piles in winter bring them through in good condition. Hundreds of excellent steers are annually bought up in the district for outside markets as well as for local consumption. It is not claimed for this district that it is safe or economical to winter out cattle or better class horses in ordinary seasons, although native ponies do wonderfully well pawing for their living. There has hitherto been no want felt for cultivated hay, the natural growth as yet being in sufficient abundance. Timothy has been grown here and there, but other grasses can scarcely be said to have been tried.\n\nSheep are not very generally kept, although it has been found they\ndo remarkably well and there are already a few flocks attaining considerable dimensions; one gentleman owning nearly one thousand head, consisting chiefly of Merinoes crossed with Southdown. They seem entirely suited to the soil and climate; are prolific; stand the winters well, and yield capital mutton, and wool of excellent staple. Shropshires also succeed here, as do those of mixed breed originally brought out from Red River. There is no longer any room to doubt that sheep will succeed admirably here.\n\nPigs are reared by almost everybody, but not in such numbers as they might be. Pork is consumed chiefly in the fresh state during the winter, and large quantities of bacon are imported, there being as yet no attempt at curing or packing except for private use. This, however, will no doubt be one of the great industries of the future. The native race of pigs, which a few years ago was to be seen everywhere, has now been, in a great measure, supplanted by Berkshire and other improved breeds.\n\nLimited space prevents further details, which the practical farmer will not require. It remains to be said that when the Hudson's Bay\nVICTORIA\n\nLivery, Feed and Sale Stables\n\nNISBET AND RIVER STREETS,\n\nPRINCE ALBERT, SASK.\n\nThe Oldest Established Livery Stable in Prince Alb. rt.\n\nEvery Attention Given to Customers.\n\nFarmers will find this Stable convenient for Feeding.

What is required after railway facilities is the influx of a few thousand settlers of the right stamp, those having the will and the ability to develop the great natural resources which are here spread out before them.\nR.

Robertson, president of the Carrot River Society, remarked: \"as a stock-raising country, I believe no part of this great North West Territory offers superior advantages to our own district. The climate, food and water are all that can be desired. Within the past five years this great branch of our future wealth has made some wonderful strides; every year has seen not only the natural increase but large herds of the best grades imported, and today there is no question as to its future for all kinds of stock raising purposes. We have the fodder, in the shape of luxuriant grasses, which may be had for the cutting; while in the older provinces cattle have to be fed on timothy and turnips. I am a pioneer for the third time\u2014first in Quebec; then in Ontario and now in the Saskatchewan\u2014and I have no hesitation in saying that for cattle raising and for general farming this district is superior to either Ontario or Quebec.\"\n\nA LAND OF PERPETUAL WINTER--AN EXPLODED IDEA.\n\nThe developments made with regard to Prince Albert since the \"Great North West\" became a portion of the Dominion and explorers have examined and reported upon it, have exploded the opinion once held, that it was a land of perpetual winter, and have established, beyond a doubt, its wonderful richness both as a farming and grazing country. In no part of Canada will more pleasant country homes be found; while our herds of horses, cattle and sheep; our samples of grain and vegetables; our great forests, rivers and lakes at once excite the wonder and admiration of all who visit our district. And when its resources and money making chances are mentioned, the inducements to settle are not half told. These productive and varied lands are among the cheapest on the continent. Our agricultural year is as long as in other parts of the Dominion, and the climate is such that one can distribute his labor over the whole year, making every day count. Together with these advantages, the settler must remember that he is in one of the healthiest parts of North America, and among those who are ever ready to welcome and assist the new settler.\nSTRANG & CO'Y,\nWholesale Grocers,\nAND DEALERS IN\nTeas, Provisions,\nWines and Liquors,\n18 Market Street East,\nWINNIPEG, MANITOBA.\n\nSpecial attention given to packing goods for transport in Northwest\u2014beyond the line of railway\u2014and the filling of Permit Orders.\n\nFRUITS FOR HONEST LABOR\n\nIn speaking of Manitoba and the great North-West some one has said that town lots reigned supreme. To-day investors are beginning to realize that the town lot speculator has passed away and that food supply for the world now waves the golden wand and permanent reward is being given to strokes of honest toil. There is no line, either of production or speculation, that ensures a satisfactory return equal to mixed farming when undertaken by practical men, and no country under the sun offers greater natural advantages, for this independent occupation, than the district of Prince Albert.\nOUR POSITION.\n\nThe Town of Prince Albert is very near the centre of the Provisional District of Saskatchewan. This district takes its name from the two great rivers which, descending from the elevated snows of the Rocky Mountains, wander with strangely varying course till they find their outlet in Lake Winnipeg. The rich rolling prairie lands of the Saskatchewan Valley, west of the forks, dotted throughout its whole extent by innumerable lakes and ponds, was formed by the rolling tide of rushing waters coming down from the lofty mountains from the west; gradually the higher lands became bare by the sinking of the water; lakes were formed and water courses worn away by the strength of the currents. On the banks of one of these great rivers the Town of Prince Albert finds itself occupying one of the most important positions within the Northwest Territories. It was established in 1866 by the late Rev. Jas. Nisbet, as a mission for Indians, and the church and schools carried on by that devoted missionary, and his successors have, in a great measure, assisted in the wonderful development which has here taken place. Enjoying all the conveniences of modern times; surrounded by the richest of agricultural and timber lands; already possessing a large and energetic population our future is assured and we can confidently recommend our district as a most desirable locality for those seeking new homes. The great pioneers of civilization have long since been represented here, and to-day no settlement can be found without its place of worship. Within the incorporated area of the Town, the Presbyterian, English, Methodist and Roman Catholic Churches, representing the four largest Christian bodies within the Dominion, have established themselves and each own commodious places of worship where services are held weekly in each.\nJ.

This particular sect has done much towards the development of the district.\n\nThe English church, established here in 1876 by the late Lord Bishop McLean, has been a prominent factor in our advancement. St. Mary's and St. Alban's churches are both commodious and substantial buildings have been erected and its missionary work is ably attended to by the Ven. Archdeacon J. A. Mackay, rector of St. Mary's and warden of Emmanuel College.\n\nMethodism, though not so long established as either the Anglican or Presbyterian denominations, has also become largely identified with our town. Substantial churches have been built and missions established throughout the country.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church, although coming in more recent times, have demonstrated their importance by erecting churches and establishing convents in our midst.\nWM.

Under the generous policy of the Territorial Government an efficient public school system has been inaugurated. The two school houses of Prince Albert, the Centre and East End respectively, are a credit to the town, and the teaching conducted in each of them is of the highest order. Both schools are full to overflowing, and soon additional accommodation will require to be provided. These two schools, built of brick, were erected at a cost, in the aggregate, of $10,000. A ward school has already been found a necessity, and during the present season another brick building will be erected for the accommodation of the children of the West End of the town.\n\nEducational work of a higher class has not been neglected. In 1879 the late Lord Bishop of Saskatchewan founded Emmanuel College for the education of missionaries and teachers for the missionary work of his diocese. It has been carried on by an efficient staff of professors since that time and has done a wonderful work among the Indian and half-breed populations. It is, no doubt, the nucleus of an important institution in connection with the future university of Saskatchewan.\nIn 1885 a High School was established in connection with the Presbyterian Mission and carried on under the direction of that Church until the close of 1889. This High School assumed a new form in the early months of 1888, when it was incorporated by the Dominion Parliament, as the Nisbet Academy, and during the summer a fine building was erected by monies raised through the energies of Rev. Dr. Jardine. Educational work was carried on under his guidance until December, 1889, when the Academy was destroyed by fire. The corporation, however, still exists; the insurance money will be invested; a considerable quantity of land was given, as the nucleus of an endowment, from the Mission property; and we expect to see the Academy, at some future time, rising from its ashes and fulfilling still more effectually than in the past, the purpose for which it was founded.\n\nIn addition to these institutions our public school accommodation has lately been increased by the addition of a High School branch, thus making Prince Albert one of the most important educational centres within the Territories.

The agriculturalist has far to seek ere he finds richer or more productive soil than abounds here; nutritious grass of the most luxurious growth will afford sustenance for the myriad herds of the stock-raiser; iron mines await development; the beds of all our streams abound in gold, while indisputable evidence is forthcoming of the existence, in paying quantities, of silver, tin and lead; salt springs innumerable produce a finer quality of this valuable mineral than any of the now well known centres; gypsum beds, tar and petroleum springs, and quarries of useful stone are scattered over the country; while in the far north, as yet unpenetrated by civilization, the fur trade is still prosperous. These are things which are known to exist, and when it is considered how long they remained undiscovered, it is but fair to assume that a few years more will reveal other treasures, equally valuable, still hidden from the knowledge of men.\" \u2014 Wm.

But parties desiring to locate should remember that here they have free house, stable and fence material, which ensures $200 going as far as $1,000 in any country entirely prairie. Stock can be bought cheap and implements are offered at tempting prices, so that the new settler need only encumber himself with whatever little capital he may possess and such neighbors and friends as he may be able to prevail upon to join him in his venture.\n\nIn every city every people had a beginning and the greatest of commonwealths have sprung from feeble communities; as with others so with us, our district had its beginning, and with no misgivings as to its future. You are asked to examine its resources.\n\nSPORT IN OUR DISTRICT.\n\nIn addition to the many advantages already referred to, our district offers unexcelled advantages to the lover of the gun, and no portion of the North-West is more entitled to that much abused term \"Sportsman's Paradise.\" Those who consider that the ideal of human happiness is attained with the rifle or the shotgun will here find use for both to their hearts content. Of game, large and small, there is a variety. Within the district are found, and in abundance, the bear, the lynx, the moose, and the deer, partridge, prairie chicken, wild turkey, goose and duck. Taken all in all, with its great variety of game and beautiful scenery, there are few such grounds now open to sportsmen as are awaiting all comers in this picturesque district.\nW.

Now, if we take a line from here and continue it on through the very rich and fertile country lying twenty to thirty miles north of Carleton, we will be passing through about the centre of the True Fertile Belt of this portion of the Continent, and the best route for a Canada Pacific Railroad across it. The Fertile Belt has been defined as being bounded on the north by the North Saskatchewan River. It will yet be found that there are ten acres of fertile land lying north of the North Saskatchewan for every one acre lying south of it.\nJ. M. R.

A fee of $10 is charged for an ordinary homestead entry; but for lands which have been occupied an additional fee of $10 is chargeable to meet inspection and cancellation expenses.\n\nHOMESTEAD DUTIES.\n\nUnder the present law homestead duties may be performed in three ways, and on making application for entry the settler must declare under which of the following conditions he elects to hold his land:\n\n1. Three years' cultivation and residence, during which period the settler may not be absent for more than six months in any one year without forfeiting the entry.\n\n2. Residence for three years anywhere within two miles of the homestead quarter section, and afterwards actual residence in a habitable house upon the homestead for three months next prior to application for patent. Under this system 10 acres must be broken the first year after entry; 15 additional in the second, and 15 in the third year; 10 acres to be in crop the second year and 25 acres the third year.\n\n3. The 5 years system under which a settler may reside anywhere for the first two years (but must perfect his entry by commencing cultivation within six months after the date thereof), breaking 5 acres the first year, cropping those 5 acres and breaking 10 acres additional the second year, and also building a habitable house before the end of the second year. The settler must commence actual residence on the homestead at the expiration of two years from date of entry, and thereafter reside upon and cultivate his homestead for at least six months in each of the three next succeeding years.\n\nAPPLICATION FOR PATENT\n\nmay be made before the local agent, any homestead inspector or the intelligence officer at Medicine Hat or Qu'Appelle Station. Before making application for Patent the settler must give 6 months notice in writing to the Commissioner of Dominion Lands of his intention to do so.\n\nINTELLIGENCE OFFICES\n\nare situated at Qu'Appelle Station and Medicine Hat. Newly arrived immigrants will receive at any of these offices information as to the lands that are open for entry, and from the officers in charge, free of expense, advice and assistance in securing lands to suit them.\n\nA SECOND HOMESTEAD\n\nmay be taken by anyone who has received a homestead patent or a certificate of recommendation countersigned by the Commissioner of Dominion Lands upon application for patent made by him, and had earned title to his first homestead on, or prior to, the second day of June, 1887.\n\nINFORMATION.\n\nFull information respecting the land, timber, coal and mineral laws, and copies of these Regulations, as well as those respecting Dominion Lands in the Railway Belt in British Columbia, may be obtained upon application to the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, Ottawa; the Commissioner of Dominion Lands, Winnipeg, Manitoba; or to any of the Dominion Lands Agents in Manitoba or the North West Territories.\n\nA.

While we are satisfied that the Territories generally offer valuable openings for Capital and Labor, OUR DISTRICT possesses many great natural advantages entirely unknown in many of the most favored parts of the Dominion. It has thousands of acres of the richest AGRICULTURAL and FOREST LANDS, COAL in abundance, an unlimited supply of PURE WATER, and all the advantages of MILLS and MARKETS offered in the old established settlements of the east. Truly has it been said of Saskatchewan, that while its richness has tempted hundreds of practical men to seek homes for themselves and their families, and while much has been said and written of its merits, comparatively little is as yet known of its VAST RESOURCES. Thousands of acres of VIRGIN SOIL still await development from the hand of the practical farmer, treasures in LUMBER, COAL and PETROLEUM lay untouched awaiting the energy of the capitalist, and its rivers and great lakes are teeming with SALMON, PIKE and WHITEFISH.\nLUMBER.\n\nMOORE & MACDOWALL\n\n(LIMITED)\n\nHave a Large Stock of\n\nLUMBER!\n\nFOR SALE.\n\nALEX.
