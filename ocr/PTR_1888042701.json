WHITE\n\nThe Northwest, in common with the rest of the Dominion, is called upon this week to mourn the loss of one of Canada's noblest sons and greatest patriots. The news of the death of the Hon. Mr. White fell like a thunderbolt on the people of this place; people of all races and creeds and of all political parties are sorely grieved at his unexpected demise. In the Northwest Territories he was a true friend and one of our most patriotic public men. He was pre-eminently a Canadian, and although a strong party man, he did not go so far as to make the general welfare of the country subservient to the exigencies of party. The party to which he belonged has lost one of its brightest ornaments, and the Parliament of Canada has lost one of its ablest debaters that ever took part in its discussions. Mr. White was of Irish parentage, and was born on the 9th August, 1858, and was educated there. In early life he engaged in mercantile pursuits, and the words spent in the pursuit of study of law was a member of the Grammar School Boards in Hamilton and Peterborough, and was for a number of years a representative of the Mounted Police Board. Trade in the Dominion Road, and for three years was a member of the Executive of the Dominion Board and represented the latter for five years on the North-West Board. Trade in the United States. He was one of the ablest newspaper men in Canada, and founded the Peterboro Review in 1865, acquired the Hamilton Spectator in 1865, and in 1873 the Morning Star of Toronto. Mr. White has been the chief editor. He was three times an unsuccessful candidate for the House of Commons and was first elected as member for Carleton, in 1878, when he held until his death. He was also a member of the Privy Council and appointed Minister of the Interior.\n\nNOTICE\n\nIn the Supreme Court of the North-West Territories, Judicial District of Saskatchewan, before Mr. Justice LEPH.
