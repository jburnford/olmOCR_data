Sargent, Ltd., Hazelton, B.C., for material supplied to Glen Vowell School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 151-13-4, dated 1/10/24.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE. Hyde\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nEncs. (4).\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that I have received a letter from Captain Walter Houghton, of the Salvation Army Mission at Glen Vowell, in which he requests me to place before you for consideration his application for a grant to the Salvation Army of Rental for the Building now used by the Department as a school.\n\nDuring the last few weeks the Salvation Army authorities have done considerable repairs to the Glen Vowell Indian Day School, the inside has been lined with durable material and as soon as weather permits will be painted. I am given to understand that some $250.00 will have been expended on the school.\n\nThe repairs have made a great improvement both in appearance and comfort as previous to these the school was very cold in severe weather, in spite of a good fire. The example shown by the Army has induced some of the Indians of the village to make improvements to their homes.\n\nIn view of the above I do not hesitate to recommend that a small rental of $8.00 per month be paid for the use of the building now used as the Glen Vowell Indian Day School.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nOttawa, March 7th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, regarding the request of the authorities of the Salvation Army for rental for the building now used for school purposes at Glen Vowell.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department does not wish to pay rental for a church owned building in a case where the school is conducted jointly by the church and the Department. It is noted that the Salvation Army has recently expended the sum of $250 in repairs to the building. We would prefer to assist by way of a grant towards the repairs, rather than pay rental for the building. If you can obtain from the authorities of the Salvation Army receipted accounts, in duplicate, covering an expenditure up to $150, the Department would be prepared to provide a grant to that amount towards the cost of the repairs. You should attach the receipted accounts to proper voucher forms, certify the same, and send to the Department. It is hoped that this arrangement will be satisfactory to the authorities of the Salvation Army, and that the grant towards the cost of the repairs will be acceptable in lieu of the rent.\n\nKindly give this matter your early attention, and, if the authorities agree, you should forward receipted accounts, properly certified, as requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

W. Heughton of the Salvation Army Mission at Glen Vowell has approached me in connection with some very necessary work to be done at the Glen Vowell Indian Day School, and he asks if the Department will kindly assist the Mission in the cost of the work:- say Half-cost as on a previous occasion. From the standpoint of Safety and Sanitation, this Work would be a great improvement, in my opinion. The following is what I estimate the cost of the work:-\n\nBRICK CHIMNEY.\n\nThe old pipes besides being dangerous, are constantly dropping Creosote on the floor and Desks, and from every point of view a Brick Chimney is most desirable.\n\nI estimate the cost at.....$50.00\n\nNEW FLOORING.\n\nThe old floor is now almost too bad to keep clean.\n\nCost of 1200 ft. No. L Hemlock including assistance in laying and incidentals.... $100.00\n\nKALSIMINING.\n\nThe interior walls and Ceiling are now getting very dingy and the cost of this work would not exceed the sum of........ $40.00\n\nTotal Cost $190.00\n\nI would recommend that the Department give this matter kind consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, May 30th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, giving an estimate of the cost of the repairs required at the Glen Vowell Indian Day School, and requesting, on behalf of the authorities of the Salvation Army, under whose auspices this school is conducted, that the Department assist in the cost of the work.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that the total cost of the repairs required is estimated at $190.00. This Department will pay one-half this amount upon receipt from you of certified vouchers, in duplicate, in the usual manner for one-half the cost of the repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

INDIAN AGENT G. C. MORTIMER, FOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY, 1930, ON THE GLEN VOWELL INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nOriginal on File 151-13-7.\n\nI found punctuality not so good. On making inquiries from the teacher, I find the cause of same is the want of a suitable school bell. Same had been requisitioned for without success.\nOttawa, February 13, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your report on the Glen Vowell Indian Day School for the month of January last, and also to the requisition which was forwarded by the teacher for classroom supplies, it is noted that a suitable school bell is required. In this connection I have to say that our funds for the balance of the present school year are entirely assigned, and it would not be possible to give consideration to the supplying of a bell until our appropriation for the next fiscal year is available. In the meantime, however, and before the Department could place the order, I have to request that you will furnish full information as to the type of bell required. I enclose herewith a page from a catalogue showing the type of bell we supply to be installed in a tower or cupola or on a suitable covered stand erected on the school grounds. You should state where the bell would be hung, and also the size required as per the enclosed. Full shipping directions should also be given. When we have the above information, and funds are available, consideration will then be given as to whether a bell can be supplied or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Possibly owing to the extreme weather conditions of last fall and winter has hastened their decay. At any rate there are several large cracks near the top. It started to leak two years ago and patched it up then but it is beyond repair now and needs re-shingling.\n\nCould this job be done during the Easter holidays so that it will not interfere with the school work and a carpenter will be home from trapping at that time?\n\nKindly give this matter due consideration,\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.F.

Mallinson,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nLast night, when I examined the foundation posts under the Glen Vowell Day School, I found them so decayed that I believe new foundation posts should be put in at once. The foundation posts of the porch and the surface of the porch should be repaired at the same time.\n\nIn all, it would take approximately 100 lineal feet of cedar piling for foundation posts at $8 per foot would cost $80.00. The labour to take out the old posts and to put in new posts would cost about $20.00. The lumber and nails for the porch would cost about $4.50 and the labour $2.00. The material and labour for the foundation and the porch would not exceed $34.50.\n\nWill you please recommend that this work be done before any damage is done as the result of the faulty foundation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.F. Parkinson\nMajor.\nDear Sir,\n\nre- Repairs to Glen Vowell Indian Day School.\n\nI enclose, in duplicate, a letter received from Major A.F. Parkinson, teacher of the Glen Vowell Indian Day School, in regard to repairs required to the school building.\n\nI have inspected this building and agree that new foundation posts are urgently needed. Major Parkinson's estimate of the cost would seem to be reasonable, and I would request authority to proceed with the work.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nS. Mallinson,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\n\nD.M.

Parkinson, teacher of the Glen Vowell Indian Day School, reporting that the foundation posts of the school have decayed to the extent where the structure is endangered, and estimating the cost of repairs would be $34.50.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would kindly advise if funds could be provided for these repairs.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

Under these circumstances I would recommend that Miss Brierly's request for the $7.00 per month for mid-day meals be approved. This village is spread out along the river bank and is somewhat different from some of the other reserves with the houses built in comparatively close proximity to the school.\n\nThis teacher, at some future time, would like to commence a domestic science course, having the Department provide the materials for cooking, which would be used for the benefit of the above mentioned pupils. This would then have the dual purpose of the scholars being taught the art of cooking by one having graduated in Home Economics, and serving such cooking for mid-day meals. I would appreciate your comments in this regard, which I consider a very worthwhile course to be taught in all schools, where possible.\n\nS. Mallinson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Mallinson's letters of September 29th and October 11th in connection with the provision of mid-day meals at Indian Day Schools in his Agency during the period November 1st to March 31st.\n\nAlthough no provision was made in the estimates for an expenditure of this nature at the Glen Vowell Indian Day School, it would appear that provision of mid-day meals at this school is warranted and I would recommend that the necessary expenditure be authorized for the four schools.\n\nFor D.M.

Brierly, teacher of the Glen Vowell Indian Day School advised him that she had replaced the fence around the school grounds at her own expense and asked if the Department would reimburse her for the expenditure. She was advised to take the matter up with the Indian Agent but apparently was not able to do so prior to his leaving the vicinity on holiday leave and consequently forwarded her accounts totalling $72.60 for fence posts, lumber and labour to this office. I intend to refer the matter to Mr. Indian Agent Mallinson in order that further details with respect to materials and labour returns may be secured but in the meantime it would be appreciated if you would advise if funds are available for reimbursing Miss Brierly.\n\nI may say that the school building and teacher's residence at Glen Vowell are, as far as is known, the property of the Salvation Army, and as we have had the use of them without rent for many years, despite the fact that other church buildings in this Agency are rented by the Department, it is felt the Department should pay the cost of the fencing in question and other future maintenance of the buildings until such time as we are in a position to construct buildings of our own.\n\nFor D.

McKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver.\n\nKindly refer to your letter of September 3rd, 1946 your file 1-11-3 concerning repairs to the Glen Vowell school. Owing to the difficulty of procuring materials and labour, this work was not done in the Fiscal Year 1946-47 although the sum of $20 was set aside for it. I have recently attempted to secure the services of a Glen Vowell Indian to do this work but without success and so I have had Charlie Patsy of Hazelton size up the job and I enclose herewith a quotation from R.S. Sargent Limited, Hazelton for the required materials. In addition to this, Patsy estimates that the job, including the shingling of the teacherage kitchen, will take him approximately eight days at $10 per day. I would ask that a Purchase Order be issued in favour of Sargents and an Accountable Advance for labour made available at this Agency. It is understood that Patsy's estimate includes the shingling.\n\nJ.V.

DuVernet,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nPrince Rupert, Jan. 3 1910\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nGwinoha or Kitwinshilqu is the village at the foot of the Big Canyon about eight miles below Aiyansh on the opposite side of the swift river. There are two little villages, the old and the new, not far apart with a good trail between. Rev. J.B. McCullagh has the oversight of this place and for two or three years has had school amongst them. Alfred McKay the native school teacher is the same man who taught the Lakkalzap school for several years. He has built a house in the new part of the village, taught school there all last winter and is teaching there now. Under Mr McCullagh's oversight he has done good work not only among the children but in night school among the men. We think that this work deserves a grant of $300 a year. I understand from Mr McCullagh that he forwarded the school returns but mail service is irregular and letters so often go astray that it is possible they were not received. Another possibility is that Mr Lorenz, knowing no grant was made for this school, did not consider he should send them on. I remember some remark to this effect.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSgd. F.H. DuVernet.\nBishop of Caledonia.\nOttawa February, 5th 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nIn reference to the grant for the school which is being conducted by Alfred McKay at Kitwillucshilt further information is desired. A report might be made by Revd Mr. McCullagh showing what has been done during the past year in the school room and the attendance that has been secured for that period. If there are sufficient children and if their parents are so located that they can attend the school regularly the question of allowing a grant will receive consideration.\n\nYour Lordship's obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

McLean Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to report that when visiting the Naas River in the month of April, the Indians of \"Gwinaha\" (the middle village on the Naas) came to me to ask help for a school for their village in which there are eighteen children of school age. The people are very anxious for their children to be taught. I also met Mr. W. Myers (brother of Judge Myers of Winnipeg) who has lived in their village for twelve months.\n\nMr. Myers had gone with the Post Simpson Indians to the Naas to see the eelichan fisheries in March, 1910. There he met the \"Gwinaha\" Indians, and after hearing they had neither teacher nor missionary, accompanied them back to their village when the fishing was over. There he has lived in an Indian house, the Indians having boarded off a corner of the old building for his use.\n\nHe has taught an adult Bible class five days a week, and has also taught the Indians how to make bricks, which they are using for fireplaces; has cared for the sick, besides making many reforms in the village.\n\nIn the first week of March, 1911, the Chief said to Mr. Myers, \"you have been with us one year now, the winter has been very cold, the house you live in poor, and are food is not good. Are you not tired and are you going to leave us when we go away to fish the eelichans, or will you come back? We shall be sorry for you to go as people have learned so much.\" Mr. Myers replied that it was his intention to accompany them to the fishing and then to return and stay with them.\n\nA few days after this the women of the village waited on him in a body, thanking him for what he had done for the village, and expressing how glad they were that he intended to stay. They then presented him with a feather bed, blankets, and stand, mats, and a\nMr. Myers is anxious to have a day school, but does not have any school supplies, as he has been using Bibles and Hymn books only. He is about fifty years of age, and was formerly a newspaper man, and a genius at all kinds of work. The only financial help he has received, is such that his brother, the Judge, has sent from Winnipeg. I might add that the disinterested way in which this man has lived and worked has made a profound impression upon both whites and Indians, on the river. (Mr. Myers told me he intends to make bricks for a house, as they have good clay near the village and also to teach the people farming.)\n\nI would recommend that a school be authorized at this village, that school supplies be furnished and that a grant of one hundred dollars a quarter be granted. He is a most useful man on the reserve, and I cannot speak too highly of the self-sacrificing work he is doing.\n\nHis mission is not connected with any denomination, but has the esteem of all. His Lordship Bishop De Vernet highly esteem the man and the work he is doing, and spoke to me to see if help could not be given.\n\nThe supplies needed to establish a school for the children are as follows:\n\n- 1 large blackboard & 1 blackboard eraser\n- 20 books, first part 1\n- 10 second part 2\n- 1 arithmetic\n- 1 geography\n- 1 pen\n- 1 box crayon\n- 12 copy books No. 1\n- 12 exercise books\n- 20 slates\n- 3 dozen slate pencils\n- 4 lesson cards\n- 4 maps viz., world, Dominion of Canada, British Isles, N.

I beg leave to thank you for the assistance promised to our educational efforts among the Indian people at Gwinoha, from September 1910 to March 1911. I taught both the children and adults to the best of my ability without supplies or a building in which to hold the school. It taught the children from house to house and in the evenings on an average of five nights a week for at least five months. I taught a class of adults in my own room, the attendance ranging from five to twenty, and the session lasting from three to four hours. The subjects taught the children were reading and writing, and the adults were taught to read and speak the English language in both of which they made fair progress. I used as text books, the Bible, the prayer book and the Nishga-English grammar. I also tried to interest them in world wide happenings to broaden their view of life. There has been no school during April, May and June, because the people have been away from the village except one family. I have no doubt we will have every school facility needed for the future. Last winter I had the use of but one room in one of the Indians' houses and not the exclusive, either, by any means, in which to live, study, sleep and conduct all my educational work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.A. Myers\nOttawa, June 27, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of a letter addressed today to Mr. Myers of Gwinnha.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to take such steps as you consider necessary to obtain information as to whether the conditions outlined in this letter are carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\nOttawa, June 27, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of reports upon your work at the Gwinotha Indian Day School which are very disappointing. It was stated that the house in which you live and hold school was in a filthy condition and totally unfit for occupation. It was also stated that you had only a very small piece of ground 16 feet by 45 feet on which you were making preparations for gardening, but that it was not ready for planting.\n\nUnder these conditions the Department has decided to withdraw the grant from your school at the end of the current quarter until such time as the premises are thoroughly cleaned and made habitable and the renewal of the grant will be upon this condition and upon the further condition that your whole time is devoted to the school work. Be good enough to acknowledge the receipt of this letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. A. Myers, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nGwinotha Indian School,\nGwinotha,\nVia Kincolith, B.C.\nOttawa, June 25, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nRe. Gwinoha Day School, B.C.\n\nIn connection with memorandum of the 22nd ultimo I beg to call your attention to the reports of Mr. Inspector Green and Mr. Agent Perry on this school. The disgraceful condition of the building as described by both these officers shows that Mr. Myers, the teacher, is unfit to have charge of the school and I cannot see how Mr. Green can recommend that any consideration should be shown him.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A. E. Green,\nSuperintendent of Indian Schools,\n3616 Point Grey Road,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, May 22, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the letter of May the 10th from Mr. Perry, the Indian Agent, and to his report on the Qwinoha Day School taught by Mr. Myers. You will recollect that the Department recently had correspondence with Mr. Myers with reference to the establishment of agricultural industries, etc., on the reserve. I think the Agent's recommendation that the grant be withdrawn from the school should be approved at once and also that Mr. Myers should not be permitted to remain on the reserve.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6391, File 812-1, part 1)\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a report on my recent visit to the Gwineha Indian Day school, Naas River. After an inspection of the Lak-kal-zap school (which has also been reported today) during which we found the most undesirable conditions existing, a still greater surprise was given during an inspection of this school.\n\nLest the Department should feel that what was found might be exaggerated, I asked the Provincial Health Officer who was on duty on the river, to inspect the place; also Officer Gedson and Special Officer Breadhurst. These men are in a position to corroborate this report.\n\nIn my opinion Myers should never have been appointed as a teacher at this school. Mr. Inspector A.E. Green was influenced by the plausible stories of the man Myers as to the great work he was doing at Gwineha, but had the Inspector been able at the time to visit the village of Gwineha, I am sure the recommendation of the Inspector that Myers be appointed as teacher on salary would never have been made.\n\nWhen parting with Mr. Green a few days ago, after our tour of inspection, Mr. Green stated that he would recommend that the Department withdraw the grant from this so-called school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6391, File #12-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nGwinotha is an Indian settlement situated at the foot of the canon on the Naas River, about 40 miles from the mouth, in Northern B. C. It is located on a very fertile and level piece of land in shape similar to a right-angled triangle, the sides forming the right angle being about two miles long. The soil is a river silt and vegetable mould of a depth of about two feet, underneath which are sand and gravel. It is bounded by a lava bed, the Naas river and a warm water creek, issuing from underneath the lava and flowing along the base of a range of high mountains. Across the Naas there nestles among the mountain peaks a huge glacier.\n\nThe people were all heathen until about five years ago, when, under the earnest ministry of Rev. J. B. McCullagh, of Aiyansh, they renounced heathenism and embraced Christianity. A short time after they started to build a church and two years ago they became anxious to have a White missionary stationed in their own settlement. I was on the river making a study of the Indian people at the time and at the earnest solicitation of the Gwinotha people and with the hearty consent of Rev. J. B. McCullagh I accepted the position, assuredly gathering by many unmistakable signs that the hand of God was in the movement, and have been promoting the work to the best of my ability since that time. The work was entered upon and continues to be developed on the lines of faith. The position carries no salary except a small grant from the Indian Department of the Dominion Government in support of the day school, the said grant beginning last April, after the educational work which had been carried on without it for a year had been favorably reported to the governmental headquarters by the Inspector of Indian educational institutions. Many kind friends have been raised up to sustain me in the work, being constrained by the love of Christ so to do, and I am very much interested and encouraged in the work and fascinated with the tremendous scope for development.\n\nThe work is being prosecuted in four departments, namely: in the spiritual, sanitary, educational and industrial, on all of which good progress has been made. The Indian people have put in a good deal of co-operative work on their church building and bought all the materials with their own money, and have so far completed a nice frame structure 26x40 feet that we have been able to hold services regularly within it since January 22nd, 1911. No help, financial or otherwise, was asked for or received by this heroic native congregation until the time came for them to furnish the church, and this they could not do themselves and last spring they asked their fellow Christians in the Church abroad to come to their assistance. The response was disappointing to them, yet a few sympathetic friends who admired their zeal and honored their faith were raised up to their assistance. During 1911 the sum of $130 was received to help furnish the church, but this has not been enough to seat it. They need an organ, a baptismal font, a holy table, a lectern and a pulpit and furnishings for...\nthe same. There has also been received during the past year $5 for our Woman's Auxiliary and $145 in cash, a due bill for $30 worth of lumber and the donation of the lumber of an old building which will furnish enough material to build a mission house large enough for all present requirements, but doors, windows, flooring, ceiling, shingles, finishing, hardware, paints, etc., must be supplied from other sources. A small house, 16x26 feet, partially completed, was purchased for $100, and with a few dollars more expenditure on it this has been made fairly fit for occupancy, but it is much too small for our work and entirely unfurnished. However, with a few articles lent by the Indian people we have set up bachelor quarters therein. But when this small place has to be used as a bedroom, kitchen, pantry, store room, school, etc., it can readily be seen under what disadvantages the work of the mission is being prosecuted. The W.A. has been very active in raising money by the sale of their handywork and they have already spent $70 in furnishing the church and now have about $35 more in their treasury. There is a good church organization and an enthusiastic Church Army.\n\nAn assortment of medical and sanitary supplies, and a book on hygiene and home nursing has been received. Our efforts in this department are directed towards preventing serious illness and teaching a more sanitary mode of living.\n\nThe Indian Department has supplied the books and school requisites and furniture for the day school which we have established and the children are making good progress. Kind friends have also supplied us from time to time with magazines and periodicals illustrating stories and current events, which have been found very interesting to both old and young and an important educational factor. Besides the day school for the children night school is held, which is well attended by the older folks and a broader view of life is being presented to them.\n\nAn effort is being made to create an agricultural and industrial activity among these people, and if satisfactory progress is to be made in this department of the work, it must be demonstrated to the Indians by actual results that they will be able to make enough ready cash out of their farming operations to buy their groceries, flour, sugar, tea, coffee, oatmeal, rice, beans, and other necessaries for the table; their furniture and lumber and clothing and whatever else they require actual money for, which in this valley must amount to at least $500 a family per annum. This, of course, cannot be done with a spade and a garden rake on an indifferently cultivated plot of ground 100 feet square, but with potatoes selling at from two to five cents a pound and all other farm products in proportion and unlimited market; now growing up at Prince Rupert, Stewart, Goose Bay and other places within a day's run by river boat direct from the farm, this would be a very easy task even without intensive farming on a scientific basis. Acres of ground must be cleared of its scrub and spare timber and the work done with modern labor-saving implements and power machinery. It has already been demonstrated that all kinds of garden stuff grow in profusion and of excellent quality and that small fruits yield abundantly. The soil is good and the climate is almost ideal for vegetable growth. Now we propose to demonstrate to the Indian the profitableness and desirability of farming on the lines indicated, but we cannot accomplish much without help.\n\nTo prosecute successfully the four-fold work of this mission requires personal and intelligent attention and also a\ngood deal of money. As missionary in the field it gives me great delight to actively promote the work, and if the money or its equivalent is furnished by \"The missionaries at home\" regular dividends will be paid from the never-failing Treasury rich in blessings\u2014not in proportion to the amount given, but by the love that prompts and the sacrifice involved.\n\nThose who read the Pioneer and desire further information will be cheerfully furnished with full particulars and all enquiries will be received with pleasure and courteously answered.\n\nTHE TEMPLARY OF FAITH.\n\nOur prayer circle is called \"The Templary of Faith.\" Our motto is, \"Have faith in God;\" our declaration of faith is, \"United in faith, we await the coming again of the Lord Jesus Christ;\" our scripture warrant is, Luke 18, 1-8. Our hope is that The Templary of Faith will become an enduring testimony to the Faith of the Son of God, for the encouragement of future generations and the strengthening of the Church of the present day. The Templary is opened daily for prayer and thanksgiving for answered prayer; the petitions of the members from whom special requests have been received are then brought to the foot of the throne of our great High Priest for His merciful consideration. All who are able to subscribe to the declaration of faith are entitled to become Templars. It is our desire that all applications for membership shall be accompanied by a short favorite text of scripture to be inscribed upon the records of the Templary. Let us unite and make The Templary of Faith a powerful influence as a Faithful Testimony.\n\nCHRISTMAS TREE ENTERTAINMENT.\n\nThe fall term of the Gwinotha day school was closed on Friday, Dec. 22, with a Christmas tree entertainment, and oh, my! if all those who contributed articles with which to decorate the tree could have been present to see the delight the event gave to all the people in the village they would have been repaid ten-fold. Santa Claus has become the jolly St. Nicholas of these Indian children as he does of all children wherever he goes. Willing hands helped to decorate the school room with three large mottoes\u2014\"A Merry Christmas,\" \"Happy New Year,\" and \"Glory to God in the Highest.\" They also made paper flowers and ribbons displaying the national colors and other ornaments, which made the school room look like fairy land. The boys went out and got a fine large spruce tree, almost a perfect cone. We notified those whom we knew would be delighted to help to make the hearts of these Indian children glad during the happiest season in all the year early in October that we were expecting Santa Claus to entertain the school. There was a hearty response, but alas Jack Frost seriously interfered with his journey by freezing up his only means of transportation up this valley before the end of October, nearly three weeks sooner than the usual time and Santa Claus and all his supplies were stalled at the mouth of the river. The children were in despair, but I said to them, \"Santa Claus will be here all right,\" and I started the candy factory working overtime. They thought it was almost a miracle when part of the Christmas cargo arrived a week ahead of time and a fine big bundle was sent down from Mrs. (Rev.) J. B. McCullagh, of Aiyansh, so that we had more than enough, and we had to hang a baby tree from the ceiling. Ah! was not that sight a cure for any heartbreak! The dolls, bugles, swords, dishes, musical boxes, handkerchiefs, scarfs, muffs, candies, nuts, raisins, dates, gladsome hearts and happy faces.\nS. W. Pollard, the head chief of the village, has been a most hospitable friend. We have enjoyed many a good meal with him, prepared by his estimable wife, Naks Wee-shakes. He is very sick at present and it grieves us sorely. Our daily prayer for him is that he may be restored to health and strength and enjoy the comfort of the Holy Ghost.\n\nPaul Zalu did the handsome thing when the people returned from their summer's work at the canneries in September. They arrived late in the afternoon after a hard two days' trip by canoe up river. Paul presented them all with some fresh salmon which he had just caught and invited them all to supper. Paul's body is inhabited by the spirit of a great chief.\n\nA number of the stalwarts went on a four days' hunting trip in October and returned with 20 mountain sheep and everybody shared in the trophies of the chase. There was feasting until we were ashamed to look at a leg of mutton.\n\nJohnny O'Yea killed a fine big black bear and we were all invited to partake of a savoury bear stew. There is no better brand of hospitality than that produced by these Indian people.\n\nIF THE DEAD CHIEFS COULD SPEAK!\n\nIf the chiefs of the past generation could advise the living they would very likely speak in the following strain: The conditions of life are rapidly changing in your valley, dear children. They began to change years ago with us, but we set our faces against it and were blind to the good which we now see the changes were bringing to us. We are glad to see that you continue to fish and hunt and follow the customs of the past, where they do not conflict with the teaching of the Word of God, but be wise, and add to your life's activities by learning how to make your gardens, how to keep sickness away, persuade your children to learn how to live under changing conditions.\n\nOur hearts grieve for Patrick in the loss of his wife; for Samuel and Paul in the taking away of little Sophia; and for all the sick and suffering of the village.\n\nWe challenge the world to produce a happier Xmas party than that which gathered in the hospitable home of Rev. J. B. and Mrs. McCullagh, of Aiyansh. The party was limited in number, but England, Ireland, Canada and the United States were represented by three generations of jolly humanity.\n\nNOTES AND OBSERVATIONS.\n\nAll the men turned out on Dec. 20 and with axes, saws and sleighs soon cut up and hauled into the building yard our first supply of wood. Breakfast and dinner were generously served to the workers by Anna, Elizabeth and Jenny.\n\nThe seats for the church have been ordered and have been sent. Miss Miller says that the early freeze up has made it impossible for us to bring them up river until the spring. We hope that the friends of this mission will see that we have more than the seats to bring up.\n\nWe have had no mail since October 1st and there 503 newspapers awaiting a mail carrier to be brought in by way of Kitimaatinah, Aiyansh and Gwinnsha. There is no mail service yet for these upper river settlements and we need one badly. While settlement continues in and around are arranging the distribution of which is too great importance to be set aside for five months and that cannot be satisfactorily dealt with by the telegraph or telephone, which have now reached Aiyansh.\n\nBuilding operations are brisk in the settlement. Paul is building a new house. William has finished and nicely papered the inside of his; Jacob has newly painted his front room and improved his veranda; Johnny has remodelled his dwelling place and we are particularly pleased with the inside of his dwelling; Peter has made his house more comfortable; Henry is making good progress in the erection of his fine new residence; improvements are being made to the main schoolhouse church, and the cemetery is prepared cleared ground for next season's gathering.\n\nThe school teacher spent his Christmas holidays at Aiyansh, printing this little magazine. Rev. J. B. McCullagh very kindly put his small printing outfit at our disposal and we are grateful for his kindness. It for every copy of this little leaflet will give as much pleasure to our friends and helpers as the printing of it has given to us, it will be a very valuable Christmas gift to the Indians. It will be our diligent endeavor if every copy makes a friend for the mission and it would be a pleasant surprise to Mr. McCullagh if some of his newspaper friends would subscribe for copies of his printing which was destroyed by fire in September, 1910. He had a job office well equipped for the mission magazine and job work at a cost of $1,600. The Indians subscribed $65 towards a new outfit and $100 added to that is all he has been able to spare to renew the plant.\nOttawa, April 3, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter and also of a copy of \"The Gwinnha Pioneer\" edited and published by you.

But when this small place has to be used as a bedroom, kitchen, pantry, store room, school, etc., it can readily be seen under what disadvantages the work of the mission is being prosecuted. The W.A. has been very active in raising money by the sale of their handywork and they have already spent $70 in furnishing the church and now have about $35 more in their treasury. There is a good church organization and an enthusiastic Church Army.\n\nAn assortment of medical and sanitary supplies, and a book on hygiene and home nursing has been received. Our efforts in this department are directed towards preventing serious illness and teaching a more sanitary mode of living.\n\nThe Indian Department has supplied the books and school requisites and furniture for the day school which we have established and the children are making good progress. Kind friends have also supplied us from time to time with magazines and periodicals illustrating stories and current events, which have been found very interesting to both old and young and an important educational factor. Besides the day school, for the children night school is held, which is well attended by the older folks and a broader view of life is being presented to them.\n\nAn effort is being made to create an agricultural and industrial activity among these people, and if satisfactory progress is to be made in this department of the work, it must be demonstrated to the Indians by actual results that they will be able to make enough ready cash out of their farming operations to buy their groceries, flour, sugar, tea, coffee, oatmeal, rice, beans, and other necessaries for the table; their furniture and lumber and clothing and whatever else they require actual money for, which in this valley must amount to at least $500 a family per annum. This, of course, cannot be done with a spade and a garden rake on an indifferently cultivated plot of ground 100 feet square, but with potatoes selling at from two to five cents a pound and all other farm products in proportion and unlimited market now growing up at Prince Rupert, Stewart, Goose Bay, and other places within a day's run by river boat direct from the farm, this would be a very easy task even without intensive farming on a scientific basis. Acres of ground must be cleared of its scrub and spare timber and the work done with modern labor-saving implements and power machinery. It has already been demonstrated that all kinds of garden stuff grow in profusion and of excellent quality and that small fruits yield abundantly. The soil is good and the climate is almost ideal for vegetable growth. Now we propose to demonstrate to the Indian the profitableness and desirability of farming on the line indicated, but we cannot accomplish much without help.\n\nTo prosecute successfully the four-fold work of this mission requires personal and intelligent attention and also a\ngood deal of money. As missionary in the field it gives me great delight to actively promote the work, and if the money or its equivalent is furnished by \"the missionaries at home\" regular dividends will be paid from the never-failing Treasury rich in blessing\u2014not in proportion to the amount given, but by the love that prompts and the sacrifice involved.\n\nThose who read the Pioneer and desire further information will be cheerfully furnished with full particulars and all enquiries will be received with pleasure and courteously answered.\n\nTHE TEMPLARY OF FAITH.\n\nOur prayer circle is called \"The Templary of Faith.\" Our motto is, \"Have faith in God;\" our declaration of faith is, \"United in faith, we await the coming again of the Lord Jesus Christ;\" our scripture warrant is, Luke 18, 1-8. Our hope is that The Templary of Faith will become an enduring testimony to the Faith of the Son of God, for the encouragement of future generations and the strengthening of the Church of the present day. The Templary is opened daily for prayer and thanksgiving for answered prayer; the petitions of the members from whom special requests have been received are then brought to the foot of the throne of our great High Priest for His merciful consideration. All who are able to subscribe to the declaration of faith are entitled to become Templars. It is our desire that all applications for membership shall be accompanied by a short favorite text of scripture to be inscribed upon the records of the Templary. Let us unite and make The Templary of Faith a powerful influence as a Faithful Testimony.\n\nCHRISTMAS TREE ENTERTAINMENT.\n\nThe fall term of the Gwinotha day school was closed on Friday, Dec. 22, with a Christmas tree entertainment, and oh, my! if all those who contributed articles with which to decorate the tree could have been present to see the delight the event gave to all the people in the village they would have been repaid ten-fold. Santa Claus has become the jolly St. Nicholas of these Indian children as he does of all children wherever he goes. Willing hands helped to decorate the school room with three large mottoes\u2014\"A Merry Christmas,\" \"Happy New Year,\" and \"Glory to God in the Highest.\" They also made paper flowers and ribbons displaying the national colors and other ornaments, which made the school room look like fairy land. The boys went out and got a fine large spruce tree, almost a perfect cone. We notified those whom we knew would be delighted to help to make the hearts of these Indian children glad during the happiest season in all the year early in October that we were expecting Santa Claus to entertain the school. There was a hearty response, but alas Jack Frost seriously interfered with his journey by freezing up his only means of transportation up this valley before the end of October, nearly three weeks sooner than the usual time and Santa Claus and all his supplies were stalled at the mouth of the river. The children were in despair, but I said to them, \"Santa Claus will be here all right,\" and I started the candy factory working overtime. They thought it was almost a miracle when part of the Christmas cargo arrived a week ahead of time and a fine big bundle was sent down from Mrs. (Rev.) J. B. McCullagh, of Aiyansh, so that we had more than enough, and we had to hang a baby tree from the ceiling. Ah! was not that sight a cure for any heartbreak! The dolls, bugles, swords, dishes, musical boxes, handkerchiefs, scarfs, muffs, candies, nuts, raisins, dates, gladsome hearts and happy faces.\nS. W. Pollard, the head chief of the village, has been a most hospitable friend. We have enjoyed many a good meal with him, prepared by his estimable wife, Naks Wee-shakes. He is very sick at present and it grieves us sorely. Our daily prayer for him is that he may be restored to health and strength and enjoy the comfort of the Holy Ghost.\n\nPaul Zalu did the handsome thing when the people returned from their summer's work at the canneries in September. They arrived late in the afternoon after a hard two days' trip by canoe up river. Paul presented them all with some fresh salmon which he had just caught and invited them all to supper. Paul's body is inhabited by the spirit of a great chief.\n\nA number of the stalwarts went on a four days' hunting trip in October and returned with 20 mountain sheep and everybody shared in the trophies of the chase. There was feasting until we were ashamed to look at a leg of mutton.\n\nJohnny O'Yea killed a fine big black bear and we were all invited to partake of a savoury bear stew. There is no better brand of hospitality than that produced by these Indian people.\n\nIF THE DEAD CHIEFS COULD SPEAK!\n\nIf the chiefs of the past generation could advise the living they would very likely speak in the following strain: The conditions of life are rapidly changing in your valley, dear children. They began to change years ago with us, but we set our faces against it and were blind to the good which we now see the changes were bringing to us. We are glad to see that you continue to fish and hunt and follow the customs of the past, where they do not conflict with the teaching of the Word of God, but be wise, and add to your life's activities by learning how to make your gardens, how to keep sickness away, persuade your children to learn how to live under changing conditions.\n\nOur hearts grieve for Patrick in the loss of his wife; for Samuel and Paul in the taking away of little Sophia; and for all the sick and suffering of the village.\n\nWe challenge the world to produce a happier Xmas party than that which gathered in the hospitable home of Rev. J. B. and Mrs. McCullagh, of Aiyannah. The party was limited in number, but England, Ireland, Canada and the United States were represented by three generations of jolly humanity.\n\nNOTES AND OBSERVATIONS.\n\nAll the men turned out on Dec. 20 and with axes, saws and sleighs soon cut up and hauled into the school yard our winter's supply of wood. Breakfast and dinner were generously served to the workers by Amelia, Elizabeth and Jennie.\n\nThe seats for the church have been ordered and have arrived at Mill Bay, but the early freeze up has made it impossible for us to bring them down river before spring. We hope that the friends of this mission will see that we need more than the seats to bring up.\n\nWe have had no mail since October, and there is 500 pounds now awaiting a mail carrier to be brought by way of Kitamaatinak and Aiyannah to Gwaihok. There is no mail service yet for these up river settlements and we need one badly. What settlement is coming in and questions are arising the discussion of which is of no great importance to her mind; for five weeks and that cannot be satisfactorily dealt with by the telegraph or telephone, which have now reached Aiyannah.\n\nBuilding operations are brisk in the settlement. Paul is building a new house. Weskeetum has remodelled and nicely painted his new house. Jacob has newly painted his thatch room and improved his verandah; Johnny has remodelled his verandah and warmly partitioned off the inside of his dwelling. Peter has built a house and is comfortably housed. Many good progress in the erection of his fine new residence; improvements are being made to the mission house and church and most everybody is preparing cleared places for new houses.\n\nThe school teacher spent his Christmas holidays at Aiyannah printing this little magazine. Rev. J. B. McCullagh very kindly put his small printing outfit at our disposal for the benefit of the Indians. We feel sure that the result of this experiment will give us much pleasure to our friends and helpers as the printing of it has given to us, it will be a very valuable Christmas gift to the Indians many of whom will be our guests. It would be every child makes a fortune for the mission and it would be a pleasant surprise to Mr. McCullagh if some of his newspaper friends would respond to some extent his printing offer, which was made last year by first September, 1910. He had a job office well equipped for the mission magazine and job work at a cost of $1,600. The Indians subscribed $65 towards a new outfit and $100 added to that is all he has been able to spare to renew the plant.\nOttawa, February 22, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nThe school at Qwinoha (near Kincolith, B.C.) was allowed a grant of $400.00 for the teacher's salary from the 1st of July of last year. This is all that is voted for the school for next year. School is kept in a house which was put up for the Missionary, Rev. W. A. Myers, who is also the teacher, and the Department is to have the use of it for one year, rent free, from the 1st of October, 1911. There is no requisition on file for a kindergarten outfit and gardening tools.\nOttawa, December 13, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter ultimo enclosing a communication from Mr. Myers, teacher of the Gwinaha Day School, in which he asks for a grant for prizes.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you are hereby authorized to expend a sum not exceeding $5.00 for this purpose. The account in duplicate should show the articles purchased with prices.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour favor of June 27th (No. 38 & 549) just received. I acknowledge my mistake and that the decision of the Department is just. I see now that it was very foolish to attempt to do anything outside of the ordinary educational work. I thought that I was doing right in trying to interest these Indian people in market gardening, etc., but probably I could not have made a success of it. The main reason why I wanted to do that was to help the people at home during May and June, so that I could have the children here under an educational influence. As it is now nothing can be done in the way of education during the months of April & September inclusive as only two or three children are here during that time.\n\nI cannot enlarge my schoolroom this year, but I will keep it in as good condition as I know how and during the winter months will practically live with the children.\n\nI have the honor to be, sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6391, File 812-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nOn September 30th arrived at Gwinoha at 8 P.M., W.A. Myers met us on arrival and we accompanied him to his house or shack, where we had a general discussion on school and other matters effecting the general welfare of the Indian people.\n\nW.A. MYERS' HOUSE.\n\nThis building is what we would call a shack and was bought by Myers and is occupied by him. The building is not palatial in any respect, having but one large room with woodshed attached, and the floor being laid with rough lumber.\n\nMr. Myers had everything clean and there was not the slightest trace of any disagreeable smell. In one corner he had his bed, and with wash basin, cooking stove, heating stove and other furniture, made by himself, occupied about one half of the room. The other half he used for the Indian schoolchildren.\n\nWOODSHED.\n\nOn examining the woodshed closely I found that in one corner he had what we might call a dry earth closet with a hole cut through the floor, and an excavation in the ground of two or three feet with a box placed therein. With a bag of slacked lime and the ashes from the stove he was able to keep the place quite clean and without any disagreeable odor. As reported to the Department that the place was in a filthy bad smelling condition, it is impossible to comprehend. I cross-questioned Mr. Myers about the report and he explained that during his absence last summer, being called away hurriedly down the river by an Indian from Aiyansh, he did not have time to clean up the place and on account of some of the Indians having Oolichan oil.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOct. 29th, 1912.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nwhich is strong smelling, and potatoes stored in the place,\nand the shack being closed up, no doubt when Agent Perry and\nwith Provincial Constable forced or broke open the\ndoor, they would naturally find a very different smell and\nthe place not as tidy as one might expect.\n\nHOUSE BROKEN INTO.\n\nI cannot conceive what authority any of these parties\nhad to enter Mr. Myers' house during his absence.\n\nMR. W. A. MYERS.\n\nAs to Mr. Myers himself, I found him neatly dressed\nand clean and tidy in appearance. He seems to have a strong\ndesire to help the Indian people and their children.\n\nSCHOOL.\n\nMr. Myers has been trying to help the Indian children\nwith their schooling, having used his own house for that pur-\npose. Neither Mr. Myers nor myself consider this at all a\nsuitable arrangement, but in the absence of anything better,\nMr. Myers has done the best he could, and it seems to me that\nthe Department should have been requested two years ago to\nprovide proper school building. According to Mr. Myers he\nhas had uphill work for the last three years and has received\nvery little encouragement in his efforts to educate the Indian\nchildren.\n\nMy Myers reports that they have seventeen children of\nschool age and expect to have four more this fall. I would\nstrongly recommend to the Department the building of a school\nhouse with the necessary furniture, and also that they have\nthe school grounds cleared and fenced.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nIndian Affairs.

MYERS AT HIS OWN EXPENSE THIS SPRING.\n\n500 seed potatoes.\n\n$3.00 worth of garden seeds.\n\n50 lbs. of flour to old Indians.\n\nMr. Myers claims that he paid $40.00 in freight charges on Government supplies, but rather than have any further trouble he did not send in any account. I would recommend to the Department that Mr. Myers be requested to send in his account and if satisfactory, the same be paid.\n\nThe salary for teaching the school should be increased to $60.00 per month as the cost of supplies in the Nass River are very high, and as Mr. Myers has proved that he is taking considerable interest in the Indian people, we should do all we possibly can to help him.\n\nThe Reverend Mr. McCallough of Aiyansh spoke very highly of the ability and earnestness of Mr. Myers' efforts on behalf of the Indians.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Sir,\n\nOttawa, Canada.

During the summer while all the Indians are away from their village, I will be operating a mail, passenger and freight transportation service on the river, but I can devote the winter months exclusively to teaching the Indian children.\n\nThe friction of last No. member has happily been overcome and I will undoubtedly do good work amongst them when they return in the\nfall.\n\nI will be leaving for Swinoka\nthe first week in May and an\nearly remittance will be very\nacceptable.\n\nYours very truly\n\nW.

Before any further payment on account of salary can be made it will be necessary for you to submit returns through the local Agent covering the period for which you claim payment.\n\nWith regard to the other items for which you claim you should receive payment it will be necessary for you to send in receipted vouchers properly certified by the Indian Agent.

During the past winter these children were voluntarily taught by Paul Mercer, an educated Indian from Gitladamicks. Mr. Collison recommends that Mr. Mercer be placed as teacher at Gwinoha from October to March next, at a salary of $50.00 a month. This would mean an expenditure of $300.00 for Mr. Mercer's salary.\n\nWhen Gwinoha school was closed, Mr. Agent Perry was instructed to make arrangements for storing all equipment and stationery and it is likely very little further expenditure will be required in this regard.\n\nI would be pleased if you would state what answer should be given to Mr. Agent Collison.\nExtract from Report of Agent Collison for the month of June regarding matters in connection with the Agency, dated July 28, 1920. Original on 427000-61\n\nAt Gwinoha, a small Indian village at the lower end of the canyon, I found a few Indians as the rest had gone to the canneries. The population of this village is about 50 people. There is no school, although during two or three months last winter the children of the village, numbering about 20 of school age, were taught by Paul Mercer, an educated Indian from Gitladamicks. His services were given voluntarily, for which great credit is due to him.\n\nFor the coming winter months I would suggest the placing of Paul Mercer at Gwinoha to teach school from October to March at a salary of $50.00 a month. He has a fairly good education and fill the post until some better arrangement is made.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, June 13, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo informing the Department that there has been trouble at Gwinoha, Nass River, over the rental of the school building from Chief Paul Zalu and recommending that, in view of the poor attendance, the lack of interest on the part of the two chiefs and the absence of suitable school quarters, that this school be closed at the end of the fishing season.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation, this school may be closed at the end of the fishing season. You will be good enough to inform the teacher accordingly and also notify Chief Zalu that his house will not be required after for school purposes. When the school is closed you will be good enough to make arrangements for the storing of all the equipment and stationery. Kindly advise the Department of the exact date on which this school is closed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nO. C. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to inform you that there has been trouble at Gwincha, Nass River, over the rental of the school building from Chief Paul Zalu. When Mr. Vangorder, the teacher, went there I arranged with Zalu that Mr. Vangorder should occupy his house, using one room for a school-room and the other for his personal quarters. Both rooms were rented to me at $7.00 per month as a school building.\n\nThere is another chief at this point, named S.W. Pollard, who has been jealous of Zalu because the latter is receiving a little money from the Department; while at the same time Pollard has no suitable place to offer the Government, and, indeed, there is no other place in the village that can be made use of for school purposes.\n\nZalu has lately been taking advantage of the teacher by demanding more rent, and has threatened Mr. Vangorder with violence, as well as actually engaging with him in hand to hand struggle. I had to have Constable Phillipson visit this place.\n\nPollard, too, has lately been threatening Mr. Vangorder.\n\nThe little village of Gwincha has only a population of 67 Indians, and these have never taken any interest in the school. The attendance has never been good, and lately only three children have been at school. It is possible, at the time all the Indians are at home and their friends staying with them, which is only for about four months in the year.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nsecure an attendance of 13 children, and these only come at very infrequent intervals, the Indians being in course of their nomadic pursuits in connection with their camps close to home.\n\nIn view of the poor attendance, the lack of interest on the part of the two chiefs and the absence of suitable school quarters, I would recommend that this school be closed at the end of the fishing season. The Department is paying $75.00 per month all year round for a teacher's salary and in addition is furnishing fuel, light and rental; and the results are practically nil. In war time this expenditure appears unwarranted.\n\nI would add that I have discussed the matter with Mr. Cairns, Schools Inspector, whose views are the same as my own on this matter.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 12, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Inspector Cairns in which he states that Mr. Frank Vangorder has been sent to take charge of the Winona school, that Mr. and Mrs. R. R. Johnson have gone to Aiyenah and that Miss Lydia Hayes has gone to Gitlakdamike.\n\nMr. Cairns has been informed that the Department approves of the appointment of Mr. Frank Vangorder as teacher at Winona, Mr. R. R. Johnson at Aiyenah and Miss Lydia Hayes at Gitlakdamike and that they will be paid at the same rate as the former teachers of these schools, viz.- $75.00 a month for the ten teaching months.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nG. G. Perry, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMetlakatla, B.C.\nOttawa, October 12, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd ultimo giving the names of the three teachers who have been sent to take charge of the Indian day schools at Gwinotha, Aliyansh and Gitlakdamiks and enclosing vouchers covering their travelling expenses from Vancouver to Kincolith.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department approves of the appointment of Mr. Frank Vangorder as teacher at Gwinotha, Mr. R. R. Johnson at Aliyansh and Miss Lydia Hayes at Gitlakdamiks. They will be paid at the same rate as the former teachers of these three schools, viz.- $75.00 a month for the ten teaching months.\n\nA cheque in payment of the transportation expenses of these teachers has been sent to the Union Steamship Co., as you requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. W. Gairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n249 Hastings St., East,\nVancouver, B.C.\nSir,-\n\nI beg to inform you that Duncan C. Scott, Esq., Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, after a full discussion of school matters on the Nass River, has given authority to make appointments of teachers to take the places of the Misses Chastenay and Bowen, of Aiyansh and Gitlakdamiks, respectively, and Miss Freeman, of Gwinoha, who has resigned. The two first named teachers have been given a month's notice to vacate their school.\n\nConsent has also been given to discontinue the Field Matroncy at Gwinoha and to the appointment of a male teacher who will be able to minister to the needs of the small Gwinoha population, so that it will be no longer necessary to have a second person appointed simply for company for the teacher.\n\nI would inform you that in accordance with instructions of the Deputy Superintendent General I have taken steps to have suitable appointments made jointly by the School Inspector and Inspector of Agencies, at Vancouver, who will have any assistance I can give.\n\nI trust that the steps proposed to be made will have the effect of producing more efficient and effective work, and that the schools of these villages will be in operation under good teachers when the Fall session commences.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nCharles C. Perry,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Duncan C. Scott Esq., Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, after a full discussion of school matters on the Nass River, has given authority to make appointments of teachers to take the places of the Misses Chastenay and Bowen of Aiyansh and Gitlakdamiks, respectively, and Miss Freeman of Gwinoha, who has resigned. The two first named teachers have been given a month's notice to vacate their schools.\n\nConsent has also been given to discontinue the Field Matroncy at Gwinoha and to the appointment of a male teacher who will be able to minister to the needs of the small Gwinoha population, so that it will be no longer necessary to have a second person appointed simply for company for the teacher.\n\nI would inform you that in accordance with instructions of the Deputy Superintendent General, I have taken steps to have suitable appointments made jointly by the School Inspector and Inspector of Agencies, at Vancouver, who will have any assistance I can give.\n\nI trust that the steps proposed to be made will have the effect of producing more efficient and effective work, and that the schools of these villages will be in operation under good teachers when the Fall session commences.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd. Charles C. Perry,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith a copy of a letter addressed to Miss L. Cleveland, Field Matron at Gwincha, Nass River, as a result of a consultation with Duncan C. Scott Esq., Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, at Prince Rupert B. C., on the 30th ultimo.\n\nI would point out that Miss Bowen the teacher at Gitlakdamike was to have held school at Port Nelson during the months of July and August, but as she chose to take her vacation during June and is at present in Vancouver, the expense of travel between Vancouver and Port Nelson would have been too great seeing the Deputy Superintendent General has consented to a change of teachers at Gitlakdmike next session.\n\nMiss Cleveland may be willing to work at the Port Nelson Cannery during July and August. If she does not do so the summer school arranged for at this point will not be held. The Nass Harbour summer school will be held as last year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSgd. Charles, C. Perry,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa., Ont.\nDear Miss Cleveland,\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs has visited Prince Rupert, and I have had the opportunity of discussing school matters with him.\n\nAs to future prospects for the village of Gwinoha, the resignation of Miss Freeman has resulted in a proposed change of arrangements. Having in mind the necessity for the practice of economy on account of the war, the school attendance, the cost of maintenance of the present arrangement in proportion to the small population, it is the decision of the Department to dispense with your services as Field Matron and to appoint, if possible, a man for Gwinoha who will be able to minister to the needs of this settlement at less expense and, it is hoped with equal efficiency.\n\nI have telegraphed to Miss Bowen not to go to the expense of going from Vancouver to Fort Nelson, as a change is also being made at Gitlakdamiks. This will make it necessary for you to work alone at Fort Nelson during the months of July and August in accordance with plans already made. It is proposed to recommend to the Department that you be paid salary to the end of September at which time you will terminate and vacate the Field Matroncy. This will admit of your taking a month's vacation according to arrangements. Your period of actual work will terminate at the end of August. Should you not wish to work alone at Fort Nelson it will be your option to discontinue work at the end of July, in which case no allowance for vacation can be recommended.\n\nMiss L. Cleveland,\nField Matron,\nGwinoha, Naas River, B.C.\nI would point out that since you have been engaged at Gwinoha your services have been efficient and duly appreciated. Should another vacancy come under my notice, I will be pleased to do what I can for you and will bear you in mind should you so desire.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) Charles C. Perry.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 20, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant with reference to the re-opening of the Qwinoba Indian Day School and furnishing an estimate of the cost of conducting the same during the five months from November to March, the period which you recommend that this school should be kept open.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as you state it will be possible to secure suitable quarters in some Indian house for a nominal rent and that you have a native teacher in view to carry on the work, the Department will approve of re-opening this school during the winter months. You may, therefore, make the necessary arrangements to obtain a suitable house in which to carry on the work and the school should be opened by the first of November next, and, if the attendance warrants, it may be continued until the end of the following March.\n\nThe Department will approve of the appointment of Paul Mercer as teacher and will allow him a salary at the rate of $50.00 per month. He will also be entitled to the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum in addition to his salary. It is noted that the cost of the rent and fuel will not exceed $15.00 per month.\n\nIt is hoped that there will be a good attendance of the Indian children of the village and that the work of the teacher will be satisfactory to yourself and the Indian parents.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to go to any expense in fitting up a building, other than the supplying of the school material required. The requisition forwarded by you has been received and the supplies asked for therein will ordered from the Government Stationery Office.\n\nYou should see that the teacher forwards a return showing the attendance, days taught, etc., at the end of December next, and also at the end of the March quarter, when the school closes, and you should also forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, in payment of the rent of the building and the fuel supplied.\n\nThe continuation of this school and of the services of Paul Mercer will depend upon the success which is attained in the work.\n\nYou will be good enough to give the matter of obtaining\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\ntaining a building and having it placed in a condition to carry on the work your early attention and the school should commence operations on the first of November, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nFor Aest. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your favour (#38549/1) of date August 9th., I beg to state with further reference to the re-opening of the Gwinoha Indian Day school that when the school was closed in 1917 by Mr. Perry, on account of the small attendance and apparent lack of interest on the part of the Indians, I believe a large part of the trouble was on account of the unpopularity of the teacher, who could not get on with the Indians and even quarreled with one of the chiefs of the village.\n\nWith regard to school quarters, whilst the village is too small for a regular school building, it will be possible to secure suitable quarters in some Indian house for a nominal rent. The sum of $65.00 per month for five months viz., November to March would cover all expenses, allowing $50.00 per month for the teacher and $15.00 per month for rent and fuel. In suggesting a native teacher, I felt the number of children at Gwinoha did not warrant the appointment of a White teacher, besides being more economical and also would prove satisfactory. The people of Gwinoha have asked for someone to teach their children during the winter months, and this work was voluntarily undertaken last winter by Paul Mercer, a native teacher, who for a number of years assisted the Rev. J.B. McCullagh at the Aiyansh mission. Should the re-opening of this school be approved by the Department, I would recommend the appointment of Paul Mercer for the work, as long as he gave satisfaction to the Department.\nmaking the foregoing suggestions, I feel it is in the best interests of the Indians concerned, and that it is not the wish of the Department that these few children should grow up without teaching of any kind.\n\nAll the school material formerly in use at Gwinoha was transferred to the Gitlakdamiks school, I am therefore enclosing a requisition for a few school supplies for Gwinoha, in order to save time, should the Department favourably consider the re-opening of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your favour (#38549/I) of the 20th of September advising me that the Department had favourably considered the re-opening of the Gwinoha Indian Day school and the appointment of Paul Mercer as teacher at a salary of $50.00 per month with bonus.\n\nA suitable building has been secured for use as a school house. I have also notified Paul Mercer of his appointment and informed him that the continuation of his services would depend entirely upon the success of his work in the school. I feel sure the confidence placed in him will cause him to put forth his best endeavours to make the school work at Gwinoha a success.\n\nI am hoping to make another trip to the upper Nass river during the month of October and will then be able to complete arrangements for the re-opening of the school on the 1st of November.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nA small Government school is carried on in this village by Paul Mercer, an Indian teacher, who, although not properly qualified is, never the less, doing good work by teaching the children of this small community. The school is open for six months in the year, from October until the end of March.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF MR. AGENT COLLISON,\nON GWINCHA INDIAN DAY SCHOOL, DATED October, 1922.\nOriginal on File 388549-7.\n\nThis school was re-opened on October 1st, 1922,\nfor the winter term with a total attendance of twelve\nchildren on the roll.\n\nx x x\n\nLast year the Indians decided to move their\nvillage to a more favorable site on the other side of the\nriver. As a few families have already moved across, the\nschool attendance has in a way been interfered with.\nGWINOHA DAY SCHOOL.\n\nImpossible to get a white teacher for this cause. The work is going along nicely, but only for six months per year.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to transmit herewith the enclosed requisition for school material for the Qwinaha Indian Day School. During my trip up the Nass River this fall, I inspected the Indian church building used for school purposes and made arrangements with Mr. Paul Mercer, the native teacher, to re-open school in October as soon as the people returned to the village. My visit to the village was made on the 25th of September.\n\nThe operation of this school is not entirely satisfactory partly owing to the fact that it is impossible to give the teacher any personal supervision during the winter months when the Nass River is closed to navigation. Nevertheless, I believe Paul Mercer, who has not the same advantages as a trained teacher, is doing his best under the circumstances. The small number of children at this village did not warrant the appointment of a white teacher and rather than allow the children to grow up without any education, it was decided to appoint the present teacher, who would be able to impart, at least, an elementary education and teach the children how to read and write.\n\nThe whole arrangement being only a temporary one, I have not recommended any expenditure for desks or other school furniture until a more satisfactory and permanent building can be provided either by the Department or the people themselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report as follows for the months of January and February.\n\nAn application was received from the Indians at Gwinaha on the Nass River asking that the day school be re-opened. In view of the fact that the Salvation Army is taking up mission work in this village next fall and contemplate placing a white officer in charge who could also carry on the school work, I would recommend that the application receive the favorable consideration of the Department, and that a salary be paid if the teacher is suitable and proper accommodation can be provided in the village. During my next visit to the upper Nass I will be able to look into the matter and advise the Department accordingly.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith, return of the Gwinaha Indian Day School for the quarter ended Dec.31st 1924. Although the number of pupils on the roll of this school was never very large, the attendance during the quarter has been unsatisfactory on account of the parents of the children having stayed away from the village until late in the fall. For this reason school was not opened until Nov.18th and was again closed on Dec.19th as many of the Indians visited Gitlakdamix for the Christmas festivities.\n\nIt will be noted however, that the attendance of pupils during the time they were actually in the village was very creditable.\n\nThere being very few children in the village at the beginning of the year, I considered it necessary to close the school for the present.\n\nIn view of the particulars given above, I have not considered it necessary to send in a special monthly report on this school.\n\nKindly forward cheque for teacher's salary in care of this office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nWEC/JJ\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report as follows for the month of January.\n\nIt was necessary to close the Gwinahu school at the end of the December quarter as there were not enough children in the village to warrant the school being continued - at least for the present.\n\nW. E. Collison.\nIndian agent.\nOttawa, October 26th, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, informing the Department that you made arrangements with Mr. Paul Mercer to re-open the Gwinoha Indian Day School early this present month. The action taken by you in having the school re-opened is approved. It should be continued for a period of six months.\n\nMr. Mercer will be allowed salary at the same rate as was previously paid him, viz: $50 per month, supplemented by the bonus provided by law.\n\nThe Department would not be prepared to incur any expenditure for supplying desks or other school furniture until the question of the erection of a permanent building for school purposes at this point is decided.\n\nYou will be further advised regarding the requisition which you forwarded for school material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nCanyon City, Montana\n\nAug. 5, 1931\n\nSuperintendent Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI take the liberty of bringing to your attention in this direct manner the question of the Geronimo Bay School.\n\nFour years ago, the natives of this village requested a teacher, there being then eighteen children of school age in the village. They were promised a school on the securing of a teacher but as that was delayed several children were sent to school in other places. During the past year we have had an enrollment of thirteen, & at least four others have returned for the coming year. It was understood at the time of the opening of the school that even a smaller enrollment.\nentitled the village & a teacher, & that they were also entitled to teachers of their own denomination.\n\nUntil this time, salary paid, has been in the form of a $50 monthly grant with an additional $10 for services as field worker. There is no supplementary salary paid from any source, & as I have not been sent in as missionary, but in response to the demand for a teacher & understanding that in the appointment of a teacher, salary was understood, I wish merely to ask if any adjustment is possible, or if any grant may be made for family work in connection with the school. I have two small girls dependent on me & living in these isolated spots is difficult.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nR.E. Perry Capt.\nPrince Rupert, B.C., Dec. 8th, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith my daily journal and expense account and beg to report as follows for the months of October and November.\n\nAt Gwinaha (Canyon City) a small Indian village on the Upper Nass River, the day school was reopened on Oct. 14th under the charge of Miss (Captain) A.E.Kenny, Salvation Army worker. The school at this place was formerly conducted by a native teacher, the result however, not being very successful, it was closed. With a white teacher in charge no doubt things will be more satisfactory. Miss Kenny also acts as Field Matron and was furnished with a supply of drugs for the winter.\n\nI am glad to state the Indian are showing an increased interest in the education of their children which is seen in the improved attendance at most of the day schools in the agency.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 13, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, relative to the salary that will be allowed Miss A. Kenny for her services as teacher and field matron at the Gwinaha Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that a combined salary at the rate of $60 per teaching month will be allowed to cover Miss Kenny's services as teacher and field matron. This includes salary at the rate of $50 per month for teaching services and $10 per month for field matron's duties. The salary will be paid quarterly upon receipt of the usual quarterly returns of attendance, days' taught, etc., at the school. You should see that these returns are forwarded as promptly as possible at the end of each quarter. Please advise Miss Kenny of the combined salary allowed her for teaching and field matron's duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOctober 31st, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nYour recommendation that Miss Kenny should be employed by the Department as Field Matron at $50.00 per month has been received. In making such recommendations please give a detailed statement regarding the population to be served, the distance and difficulties involved in securing the services of the Departmental Medical Attendant, etc. I shall be glad to receive this information regarding the village of \"Canyon City\". As there are only 12 or 15 children to attend the Cwinaha School, it is inferred that there are not many Indians at this point and that the initial salary for Grade I Field Matron, namely $300 per annum, would be sufficient to cover the service required. No position is available at present, and no action will be taken until your report has been received.\n\nIn view of the fact that an appointment cannot be made at present, you may not wish to purchase the drugs mentioned in your letter, but if you still consider it advisable this is your authority to make the necessary purchases locally.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.B. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nfor Secretary.\nOttawa, October 27, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 7-2062 of the 15th instant, with enclosure, with reference to reopening the Gwinaha Indian Day School. The Department approves of the appointment of Miss A. Kenny as teacher, at a salary of $50 per teaching month. Her retention at this post will depend upon the average attendance and the success of the work.\n\nThe Department doubts the advisability of incurring capital expense for desks, etc., until we are satisfied that this school will be a success. You might make a special report concerning the immediate needs so far as school desks, a heater, teacher's desk and chair are concerned. The other articles on the requisition you enclosed are being ordered from the King's Printer.\n\nWith reference to the appointment of Miss Kenny as field matron, you will receive a further communication.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\n\nF. MacKenzie\nSecretary\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to attach herewith, copy of letter received from Adjutant Wm. Kerr of the Salvation Army headquarters at Prince Rupert, asking for a grant towards the salary of Capt. A. Lenny who has just been appointed missionary and school teacher at the village of Gwinaha\u2014now called \"Canyon City\", on the upper Nass River.\n\nThe Department will recall that a grant of $50.00 per month was paid to Paul Mercer, a native teacher, for carrying on school work at this village in 1925.\n\nThe Salvation Army has now started mission work at this village by the appointment of Miss Kenny and made request for a grant towards her salary.\n\nAs she has had previous experience in Indian school work and has taken a course in midwifery her qualifications appear to be satisfactory.\n\nThe Indian population of Canyon City is about 45, with a total of about 15 children of school age.\n\nA request has also been made for school furniture (table and desks) and material for the proposed school which Miss Kenny is opening immediately.\n\nIn view of the fact that the children of the village\u2014with the exception of a few who are pupils in the Alert Bay Residential School\u2014are without educational facilities, I would recommend that the request be given favorable consideration and a grant of $50.00 per month given for school\nteaching, and an additional grant of $50.00 per month for field matroncy work.\n\nI think it advisable that a small supply of simple drugs should be forwarded immediately for use in this village, and would request authority to purchase the necessary drugs locally owing to the short time before the river closes for the winter.\n\nThe enclosed requisition for school material has been received and is forwarded to the Department in the event of the grant being authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Collins\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Salvation Army\nDistrict Headquarters Northern B.C.\nPrince Rupert B.C.\nOct. 4th 1930\n\nW.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nPrince Rupert B.C.\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nCommissioner R.Hoggard after some considerable time and thought has appointed Capt.A.Kenny to take charge of our work in Canyon City, and missionary and school teacher, at the request of the people of that village.\n\nThe captain is well qualified for this work, and has had considerable experience in such, being for three years girls' matron in the St.Georges, and some time at Coqualeetza. She has also been in charge of our work in Petersburg, Alaska, was in charge of the school at Glen Vowell B.C for nearly two terms.\n\nCaptain is also a qualified nurse, getting her training in our Grace Hospital Winnipeg where she worked for three years.\n\nSince there is a sufficient number of children of school age to warrant the opening of a day school, and the continued desire and the pressure to have the opportunity of educating these children, we are adhering to their request and would appreciate the usual grant allowance for school purposes in this village of Canyon City.\n\nThanking you and the Department in advance for your practical co-operation and support in this undertaking, believe me to be\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"W.Kerr\"\n\n(Adjutant Wm.Kerr)\nDistrict Office\n\n(cop)\nPrince Rupert, B.C. Dec. 14, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report for the month of November.\n\nThe Indians of Gwinaha at the Nass river canyon have asked that a white teacher be sent to their village. The Salvation Army having taken over the mission last year, promised to send a S.A. Officer who would act as school teacher, and receive a grant from the Department for his services, if approved. The arrangement however, fell through, as I believe the Indians would not contribute the amount asked for towards the support of the S.A. worker. Owing to the small number of children, about twelve or fifteen who would attend the school from October to March, I would not recommend the sending of a white teacher for the present, but if it were possible to secure the services of a native teacher for next winter, I think it would meet the situation.\n\nW. E. Collison.\nIndian Agent.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to transmit my report for the months of October and November.\n\nGitwunsilthqu:\n\nOn my arrival at Gitwunsilthqu\u2014generally known as Gwinaha\u2014at the Nass Canyon, I met many of the Indians and presided at a meeting to discuss the appointment of a teacher for this place. When the Salvation Army mission was established at this village last year, the Army authorities promised to appoint a white officer who would also take charge of the day school. As no appointment has yet been made, it has not been possible to make any recommendation to the Department regarding the appointment of a school teacher. A substantial building was put up by the Indians for religious purposes and for use as a school in the expectation that a white officer would be appointed.\n\nOn my return to Prince Rupert, the matter was taken up with the Salvation Army authorities who assured me that an appointment would be made next year.\n\nThe people of this village, some forty in number, are carrying out several village improvements, and seem fairly prosperous.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 19th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your agency report dated the 8th instant for the months of January and February, last, relative to the reopening of the school at Gwinaha, on the Nass River, I beg to say that the Department will await a further report after your visit to the Upper Nass, when you should enquire into the matter of the reopening of this school and advise the Department as to whether you would recommend that the school be reopened and a grant provided for the salary of a teacher. If the Salvation Army takes up mission work at this village next fall, and places a white teacher in charge who could carry on the classroom work, the Department would be favourably disposed to consider the providing of a grant towards his salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 30, 1931.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th ultimo, with reference to your work in the Gwinaha Indian Day School, and requesting an increase in salary. It was the Department's understanding that you are in Holy Orders with the Salvation Army and that, of course, you would be receiving a grant for your missionary activity. When the arrangement was first made, the Department was asked to supply only a part of your stipend. Please correspond with Mr. Indian Agent Collision in this connection, informing him whether or not you are in receipt of help from the Army. He will then make a recommendation to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Farrier\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss (Capt.) A. E. Kenny,\nGwinaha Indian Day School,\nAiyansh, B.C.\nJuly 6, 19\u2014\n\nJoseph Acton, Esq.,\nDivisional Commander The Salvation Army,\nBox 277,\nWrangell, Alaska, U.S.A.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of June 27th with reference to the resignation of Mrs. John Foster, who has been teaching at GWINSHA Indian Day School.\n\nMay I say in reply that the whole correspondence in this case should be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs through the Indian Agent at Prince Rupert. I am therefore making a copy of your letter and this reply, and am forwarding these to Mr. Indian Agent Collison for his consideration.\n\nI do not know what view the Department of Indian Affairs may take with regard to keeping the Gwinsha Indian Day School open, now that Mrs Foster has resigned. I am led to understand that the school in question had been placed in the rank of established Indian Day Schools some time ago.\n\nI am not prepared to recommend an increase of salary to the teacher at this school, till I am satisfied that a properly qualified person has been appointed, for the work being done justifies it, and that the attendance of pupils also justifies the payment of a salary in line with that of other Indian Day Schools of a like nature.\n\nMy advice which you ask for would therefore be to forward the name of the QUALIFIED teacher you are to nominate through the local Indian Agent, and let the Department of Indian Affairs to fix a suitable salary. All further correspondence on this matter should be sent to the Indian Agent at Prince Rupert to save time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Berry,\nGHD/ District Inspector of Indian School\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6391, File 812-1, part 1)\nCaptain Barry,\nInspector Indian Schools,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI have on this mail received intimation that it is the intention of Mrs. John Foster, who has been teaching at Gauyen City since the inception of the school, to resign.\n\nThis is a matter of some concern to me, as Mrs. Foster has always been reliable, but, of course, I am anxious to replace her with someone suitable for this work. However you will understand how difficult it is for us to send a qualified teacher in on the grant now being allowed this place.\n\nWill you advise me as to what might be done, or if there is any possibility of our having an increased grant or a teacher's salary as is allowed at Glen Vowell.\n\nI am anxious to immediately take this matter up with our Headquarters at Toronto, asking that we have a qualified teacher at this place, but feel I must be able to definitely place before them all particulars, as there is little time for an exchange of correspondence, and as territorial changes have just been made, it may be difficult for us to get the right person if we have not plenty of time.\n\nI have previously taken the matter of increased grant with Mr. Collison, but he argued that she was in Ottawa not as a teacher, but as a missionary. I distinctly stated that she went in solely as a teacher, and that my religious work which she might do on Sunday was of her own choice. We had been promised to send in a teacher as they had no school.\n\nI understand that Mrs. Foster has already written Mr. Collison and stated that we would not be able to supply a qualified teacher, and that he has sent her letter on to Ottawa for consideration. I regret that she wrote this without referring first to us, as if the grant can be increased to compare with other schools in the same circumstances, we will do our best to appoint a suitable person.\n\nAny advice which you might give me will be greatly appreciated.\n\nAssuming you of our desire to cooperate with you in the uplifting of the Natives, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJoseph Acton\nDivisional Commander.\nOttawa, August 4, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, informing the Department of the marriage of Miss (Captain) A. E. Kenny, teacher and dispenser at Gwinaha, Nass River. In reply I have to say that there will be no objection to Miss Kenny, now Mrs. Foster, continuing as teacher and dispenser at the salary previously allowed her, viz.: $60 per month, less 10%, for the ten teaching months of the year, for the teaching services and the dispensing of drugs. You may inform her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to inform the Department of the marriage of Miss (Captain) A.E. Kenny, teacher of the Indian Day School at Gwinaha, Nass river, to Envoy John Foster, which took place at Prince Rupert on the 27th June last.\n\nMrs. Foster is a Salvation Army mission worker at Gwinaha and is in receipt of a salary of $60.00 per month for teaching school and dispensing drugs for the Indians.\n\nIn view of Order in Council dated March 12th 1921 which provides that \"any female employee in the Public Service shall upon the occasion of her marriage be required to resign her position\", I would respectfully suggest that in consideration of the fact that Mrs. Foster is in the employ of the Salvation Army, and receiving remuneration from the Department only for services rendered, and also that she intends staying in Gwinaha, that her services be retained as otherwise the appointment of a new teacher would necessitate paying the full salary. Her husband, Envoy Foster, is also a S.A. worker in the same district.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from the Department in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nWEC, JJ\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJuly 6, 1935.\n\nW. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe attached correspondence in the case of the GWINAHA INDIAN DAY SCHOOL is forwarded for your information and any necessary action.\n\nIf the Salvation Army recommend the appointment of a properly qualified teacher at this school, I do not see any good reason why he or she should not be paid a salary in line with that paid in other small schools.\n\nI agree with you that the Department should not be called on to support Missionaries who are very poor teachers, and it ought to be very clearly stated that the new teacher, if there is to be one, goes there as a teacher in the first instance, and only as a Missionary in a secondary sense.\n\nWill you please deal with this matter from your office. The only Salvation Army teacher on my list of candidates is a single girl, and she could not be sent to Gwinaha. I have therefore no teacher to recommend for appointment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry.\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to inform the Department of the resignation of Mrs. Foster, teacher of the Gwinaha Indian Day School, Nass river. Copies of correspondence relative to a request for an increased salary for the teacher of this school are attached.\n\nAs the Department is aware the Gwinaha school is a small one, having a total of 15 pupils and an average attendance of 10 during the past year.\n\nMrs. Foster (then Miss Alice Keeney) was appointed by the Salvation Army in 1930 as a missionary school teacher. She was allowed by the Department an assisted salary amounting to $50.00 per month for ten teaching months, plus $10.00 per month paid from the school vote for dispensing simple medicines to the Indians, making a total salary of $600.00 per year.\n\nMrs. Foster was not a qualified teacher. Should the services of another teacher nominated by the Salvation Army be sanctioned by the Department at a salary in line with that given to other small schools, I would recommend that the teacher appointed be properly qualified as I do not think it fair that the Department should be called upon to pay the salaries of missionaries who are not qualified to teach school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWEC/JJ\n\nEncs.\nOttawa, August 10th, 1933.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your 7-E-6258 of the 31st ultimo, advising the Department of the resignation of Mrs. Foster, teacher of the Gwinaha Indian Day School. In reply I beg to say that her resignation is accepted.\n\nIt appears from the correspondence forwarded with your letter that it will not be possible to secure a qualified teacher for the amount we have been allowing, viz., $60 a month, less 10%. The Department agrees that there is not much value in employing unqualified teachers. At the same time, owing to a recent ruling of the Treasury Board, it is not possible for the Department to increase the salary at this school during the current fiscal year. Under these circumstances, the school should remain closed for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your communication of Sep.1st file 168-33-4 advising me of the Department's decision to close the Gwinaha Day School.\n\nIn the meantime, the Salvation Army authorities have sent in a young woman\u2014Miss Jessie Weeks to teach the school. She is not a qualified teacher.\n\nWhilst as previously stated, I am not in favor of the appointment of unqualified teachers if Miss Weeks can hold the pupils until a proper teacher can be appointed next year I would recommend her temporary appointment at the same salary given Mrs. Foster as the closing of the school would have a detrimental effect upon the Indians in the village.\n\nI would also request that the requisition for school material previously forwarded be sent to Gwinaha as the material will be needed whether the teacher's salary is paid or not.\n\nI hope to visit this point at the end of the month and will then report further concerning the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 20, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the Gwinaha Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that the Salvation Army have sent Miss Jennie Weeks to this school. It is further noted that you intend to visit Gwinaha at the end of this month. Following your visit, you should report to the Department regarding Miss Weeks' qualifications, stating if you would recommend that the same salary be paid her as was allowed the previous teacher.\n\nArrangements are being made to order from the Government Stationery Office the supplies requested on the requisition previously forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to the Gwinaha Indian Day School and in reply to your communication of the 20th ult. I beg to state that during my recent trip to the upper Nass, a visit was made to Gwinaha village, where I found Miss Jessie Weeks carrying on the day school. There are twelve pupils on the roll with an average daily attendance of nine, in grades 1, 2 and 3.\n\nWhilst Miss Weeks who is 18 years of age is not a qualified teacher having taken her high school entrance only, she impressed me as being capable and able to carry on the school this winter. Her mother is staying with her.\n\nI would recommend that she be paid $500.00 for the ten teaching months, and $5.00 per month for dispensing simple drugs. A small requisition is herewith enclosed for the needs of the village, and I shall be glad if this is forwarded at your earliest convenience as the river may freeze up any time in November.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nWEC/JJ\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, October 14, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the Gwinsha Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, the Department approves the appointment of Miss Jessie Weeks, and she will be allowed salary at the rate of $50 a teaching month, less 10 percent during the current school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, October 14, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the Gwinaha Indian Day School.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, the Department approves the appointment of Miss Jessie Weeks, and she will be allowed salary at the rate of $50 a teaching month, less 10 percent during the current school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. H. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOttawa, July 9, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nIn his report regarding his visit to the Gwinaha Indian Day School on May 30th last, Inspector Barry states that the teacher, Miss Jessie Weeks, intended to give up duties on the 30th ultimo. Please advise as soon as possible if you have received Miss Week's resignation, and, if so, you should state the name of the teacher whom the Salvation Army nominates for the position.\n\nMr. Barry states that, when he was at the school, he left with Miss Weeks a requisition including articles which should be supplied for this school for the academic year 1934-35. Please obtain this requisition and forward it to the Department as soon as possible, in order that the articles considered necessary may be ordered from the Government Stationery Office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. B. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th inst. and am enclosing herewith resignation from Miss Jessie Weeks, as teacher of the Gwinaha Indian Day School which took effect on June 30th last.\n\nAs most of the Indians were away from the village fishing and tending their gardens, school was closed temporarily on April 25th. The teacher was requested to re-open school as soon as enough pupils had returned to the village. It appears however, that the school was not opened again during the quarter and as I was not notified to this effect by the teacher, I could not advise the Department.\n\nI have been informed by the Salvation Army authorities that they are looking for a married teacher for the place. As soon as a nomination has been received, it will be submitted to the Department for approval and consideration with regard to salary.\n\nSchool return for the quarter will be forwarded as soon as received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWEC/JJ.\nOttawa, July 26, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to securing a teacher for the Gwinaha Indian Day School. It is noted that you expect to advise the Department shortly regarding the teacher nominated by the Salvation Army.\n\nI regret that present regulations will not permit us allowing a teacher at this school more salary than was paid during the academic year 1933-34, viz., $500.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. McGookin,\nActing Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nBox 393\nDrumheller, Alta.\nJuly 30th 1934\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nMr. W.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been informed of the vacancy in Conyon City School and I hereby make application for the position of teacher for that school.\n\nI attended the 1932-33 course at the Calgary, Alberta, Normal school and have received my Second Class Interim Certificate. The same year I took a course in First Aid from the St. John's Ambulance and received a First Aid Certificate. I have also a certificate for teaching Physical training.\n\nPrior to attending Normal, I had considerable experience with children which proved to be quite successful. I have taken music lessons on the piano so that I can teach singing to the pupils. I have attended the Salvation Army almost all my life and have been an active worker there for eight years. I have completed my high grade Corps Cadet Course.\n\nI expect a salary of at least six hundred and fifty dollars ($650.00)\n\nI assure first class management of the school; an active interest in all community endeavor; co-operation with the parents and board, and a personal interest in every pupil.\n\nEnclosed find a copy of a reference given to me by Dr. Coffin, Principal of the Calgary Normal School.\n\nI remain,\n\nHazel N. Taylor\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th ult., in reply to mine of July 17th relative to the Gwinaha Indian Day School.\n\nThe enclosed application was received today from Miss Hazel M. Taylor of Drumheller, Alberta, who has been nominated by the Salvation Army for the position of teacher. She holds a Second-class Interim teacher's Certificate for Alberta, and a First Aid certificate from the St. John's Ambulance Society; also a certificate for physical training.\n\nMiss Taylor is 22 years of age, and I am informed that the Salvation Army intends sending in a lady worker to live with her at Gwinaha during the winter months.\n\nAs the Department is aware, the school is a small one and I am sure Miss Taylor will be able to carry on the work with satisfaction. I would therefore recommend her appointment at $50.00 per month for the ten teaching months as authorized in your letter above referred to.\n\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to Capt. G.H. Barry, Inspector of Indians Schools at Victoria, for his information. An early reply will be appreciated as there is not much time before the school opening in September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nProvincial Normal School,\nCalgary\nAlberta\n\nJune 8, 1933\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\n\nThis is to certify that Miss Hazel Taylor has completed, at the Provincial Normal School, Calgary, the Practice teaching requirements for second class interim certificate; and, if successful in the final examinations, completed May 31st, will be entitled to accept appointment as a Second Class teacher.\n\nMiss Taylor's record in Practice Teaching is decidedly good. She gives good promise of being able to manage a school room very successfully, and I believe she will, with experience, become quite a capable teacher.\n\nE.W. Coffin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, October 21, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nIt is noted from your report for the month of September that you have not yet received any word from the Salvation Army authorities with reference to a teacher for the Gwaih\u00e1a Day School. It is presumed that the school is closed at the present time.\n\nPlease get in touch with the Salvation Army authorities again and endeavour to secure the nomination of a teacher, provided you consider it advisable to keep this school in operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Collison, Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C., for the month of September, 1935.\n\nOriginal on No. 75-168.\n\nGWINAHA:\n\nNo word has yet been received from the Salvation Army authorities regarding the nomination of a teacher for the Gwinaha Indian Day School.\nOttawa, June 21st, 1935.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your 7-E-8382 of the 13th instant, requesting that cheques in payment of the salary of Miss Hazel N. Taylor, teacher of the Gwinaha Indian Day School, for the months of April and May, last, be sent her. In this connection I have to say that payment of Miss Taylor's salary is only made quarterly upon receipt of the quarterly returns.\n\nIf this school has not continued in operation during the current month, Miss Taylor should, in preparing her return, state definitely thereon the date on which the school was closed. Owing to present regulations, it will not be possible to make payment for the two months of the quarter until, as stated, the quarterly return is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nSir:\n\nMiss Hazel N. Taylor, teacher of the Gwinaha Indian Day School, Nass river, has asked to be paid for the two months she has already taught, namely April and May, as she is in need of the money and cannot wait until the end of the quarter.\n\nAs many of the Indians are away from the village the average attendance for May was only 2.5, and in all probability the school will be closed before the end of the quarter.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I would recommend that her request be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nWEC/JJ\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to report as follows for the month of August.\n\nGWINAHA I.D.S.\n\nThe nomination of Miss H.

Please advise her of her appointment and arrange for her to re-open the school on September 4th, next.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of the 11th instant, the salary of the teacher of this school will be paid, in future, only on receipt of the quarterly return.

Payment of this amount for an eight month period will mean that she will be drawing the same salary as when she taught for a ten month period.

Carruthers of the Salvation Army, regarding Miss Edith Jater's salary as teacher of the Gwinaha Indian Day School.\n\nOn account of the poor attendance of pupils during the months of June and September, in each year, the Indians being away from the village, Inspector Barry in his inspection report of May 5th last recommended that this school be placed on an eight-months' basis from October 1st to May 31st.\n\nBy this arrangement, which I believe has the Department's sanction, the teacher's salary will be reduced to $480.00 per annum which is not sufficient. In view of the fact that Miss Jater has been teaching for three years and that her work has been very satisfactory, I would recommend that her salary be increased to $75.00 per month beginning October 1st. The Brigadier informs me that Miss Jater receives no remuneration from the Salvation Army.\n\nI would also recommend as in previous correspondence, that Miss Jater be placed on the monthly list and that her cheques be forwarded through this office.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nWEC/JJ\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nThe Salvation Army\n\nWrangell, Alaska.\nSept. 9th 1937\n\nRev W.E.

Every possible consideration should be given her.\n\nYour interest in this school and the work of the teacher is deeply appreciated, and I will be glad if you will give this consideration and make the necessary recommendations to the Department at Ottawa. It will not mean any increase in the appropriation for the year, but just allowing the same salary for the shorter term.\n\nThanking you for all your kindness in the past,\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully\n\n\"W.J.

Do you consider that this school will be in regular operation from now until the end of May? I mention the month of May owing to the fact that your letter of June 11th, 1936, stated that Miss Jater had been instructed to close the school at the end of that month.

C.\nSIR:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, copy of a communication received from Divisional Commander Carruthers of the Salvation Army, requesting an increase of salary for the teacher of the Gwinaha Indian Day school, Miss Edith Jater (Lieut.).\n\nI have just returned from a trip to the upper Nass river and visited the Gwinaha village with Capt. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools, who inspected the school.\n\nMiss Jater who holds a first-class teaching certificate appears to be a capable teacher, and is giving every satisfaction in her work. Although there were only six pupils present at the time of our visit, the average attendance during the past winter was good.\n\nI am in favor of an increase in Miss Jater's salary, and would recommend that she receive $75.00 for each teaching month beginning with September. The attendance in June each year has been so small that it is not considered advisable to keep the school open during that month.\n\nAlthough no provision was made in the Estimates for this increase, possibly the Department might be able to find the money from other sources, or charging it against \"Contingencies\" provided for in the Estimates for this agency.\n\nI have not yet received a copy of the Inspector's report, but understand he is well satisfied with the work being done.\n\nA request was also made for an additional room to be added to the teacher's present living quarters,\nbut as the building is not the property of the Department no encouragement was given. Mr. Carruthers intimated that the Salvation Army might be able to provide funds for the addition in the near future.\n\nI am anxious that the teacher should have a salary sufficient to maintain herself as I understand she is not receiving any aid from the Salvation Army.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Salvation Army\n\nPrince Rupert B.C.\nMay 16th 1936\n\nMr. W.E.

She has nearly completed her first year at this school and has had very good success I understand. The attendance shows a decided improvement this last winter, and is the best in the last eight years since the school was first opened.\n\nLieut. Jater informs me the school was inspected by Captain Barry of Victoria on May 6th, and that he seemed pleased with the work she had been doing, and has now sent his inspection report to Ottawa.\n\nSeeing Lieut. Jater holds a first-class permanent certificate from the Province of Alberta and has had three or four years experience teaching, I feel consideration should be given to an increase in her salary for the next term starting Sept. 1st. The salary grant of $50.00 per month she now receives is not sufficient for her maintenance at Gwinaha. Living expenses are rather high in Northern B.C., and then when the additional expense of freight charges up the Nass River is added it makes living costs very high at Gwinaha.\n\nI deeply appreciate your interest in this school, and in Lieut. Jater, and feel sure you will do all you can to see this teacher with such excellent qualifications is given a reasonable salary increase for the coming term. I will be pleased if you will take this matter up with Ottawa, at your earliest convenience. Thanking you for all kindness in the past, I am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"W.J.

The copy of the Inspector's report is enclosed.\n\nI would like to explain that I have not been teaching for the past few years. In 1933 the Inspector intended to return and I expected to receive my permanent teacher's certificate, but he did not do so. Since becoming a Salvation Army officer in 1933 I have not before had the opportunity of teaching. However, I have written to Edmonton, Alberta, to have my certificate extended and transferred to British Columbia.\n\nI am anxious to obtain this school and to work among the native people and can assure you the work will be conscientiously carried on.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFlorence L.Thompson (Capt.)\n\n(copied)\nCapt.

As she resides in Vancouver, I have asked Inspector Barry to interview her.\n\nMiss Thompson's application is recommended at the usual salary of $75.00 per month for the eight teaching months- October 1st to May 31st.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from the Department at the earliest opportunity so that Miss Thompson may be notified of her appointment.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.E.Gellison,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 16, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 8th instant and also copy of a letter of resignation received by you from Miss Edith A.

This nomination is approved by the Department, if Miss Thompson is in possession of a professional certificate recognized as valid in the province of Alberta.\n\nI note, however, that Miss Thompson may get married before taking up her work at the school. If such is her intention, you may inform her that present regulations do not permit us to employ married women as Indian day school teachers, except in the case of women whose husbands are physically incapacitated and unable to support them. You might, at your earliest convenience, communicate with Miss Thompson with respect to this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW. E.

This is to be regretted, as it is not advisable to send a single woman teacher to such isolated places as Gwinaha. It is on this account that Salvation Army authorities nominated a married teacher. The last teacher, Miss Edith Jater, although she had a woman companion with her for most of the time, was obliged to leave on account of the loneliness of the place which is cut off from communication during the winter months.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I shall be glad if the matter is reconsidered, and Miss Thompson's appointment approved. As it will be necessary to communicate immediately with Miss Thompson, I would appreciate being notified by wire of the Department's decision on receipt of this letter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.E.

W.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent\nPrince Rupert B.C\n\nRe Gwinaha School\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour wire received and I was more than surprised that the Department should raise any objection to the appointment of Mrs. Captain Suddaby who is so well qualified. I am sorry that the regulation you quote was not made known to me when we discussed the appointment of this teacher to Gwinaha, when I saw you in July.\n\nI went to a great deal of trouble to secure this teacher, and had considerable negotiating to have her transferred from the southern division. Captain and Mrs. Suddaby have farewelled from their appointments in the south have got married and are now on their honeymoon at Vancouver before coming north. It is going to be very difficult to secure another teacher on such short notice.\n\nMight I ask how Mrs. Hayhurst is able to teach at Greenville, if this ruling applies. I was always under the impression Mr. Hayhurst was physically fit. How do they get around this regulation.\n\nI would ask that you take this matter up with the Department by wire, and see if they will not reconsider the matter and agree to the appointment of Mrs. Suddaby as teacher for this year. If her work is not entirely satisfactory we will make a change next year, but I have no fear of this as I know of her satisfactory work in other schools before she became an Army officer. I will be glad to pay the cost of any wires you may have to send to Ottawa if there is any charge.\n\nI do not feel it would be wise to send in a young man to teach at Gwinaha. It is a very lonely spot and as you know has its temptations as all other Indians villages. I think it is much better to have a married couple as you have at Greenville and Aiyansh.\n\nThe contents of your wire has been wired to our Headquarters in Toronto so that know how matters stand. I do hope it is possible to carry out our original plan. Anything you can do in the matter will be appreciated.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.J. Carruthers, Brigadier\nDear Sir:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your telegram dated August 31st, respecting the appointment of a teacher for the Gwinaha Indian day school.\n\nImmediately on receipt of the wire, the Salvation Army authorities were notified of the Department's decision, and I am enclosing herewith, copy of letter received from Brigadier Carruthers in which he states that the transfer of Mrs. Suddaby, formerly Miss Florence Thompson, having been completed, it would be impossible at this time to make any change.\n\nI believe Mr. and Mrs. Suddaby have left Vancouver to take up the work at Gwinaha. As previously pointed out, and from past experience, I am strongly of the opinion that the appointment of single teachers, either male or female, to isolated villages such as Gwinaha is not advisable.\n\nInspector Barry has informed me that there are no Salvation Army teachers available at Vancouver.\n\nUnder the circumstances, rather than have the Gwinaha school closed for the winter, I would recommend the temporary appointment of Mrs. Suddaby, until other arrangements can be made next year.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW. R. Collison,\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa,\nOttawa,\nSeptember 22, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant with reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Gwinaha Day School.\n\nYou have no doubt received my telegram of the 13th instant approving the appointment of Mrs. Suddaby.\n\nI enclose staff questionnaire which you should have her complete and return to me as soon as possible. At the same time you should state the exact date on which she took up duties at Gwinaha.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am informed in a letter addressed to the Inspector of Schools by Brigadier W.J. Carruthers of the Salvation Army, Wrangell, Alaska, that there has been some delay by the Department in giving approval in the case of the nomination of Mrs. Suddaby, Nee Miss Florence L. Thompson, as teacher of the Gwinaha Indian Day School, Skeena River Agency.\n\nI understand that the fact that she is now married and that her husband is physically fit to support her has made it difficult for the Department to approve of the appointment of Mrs Suddaby as teacher of the above named school.\n\nInspector Barry points out that (Captain) Suddaby of the S.A. is going to Gwinaha or Canyon City as a missionary, and that such cases are different from those in which the husband is well able to support his wife, a former teacher, in which the usual practice is that the girl gives up her teaching work on marriage.\n\nOn September 9th last (Captain) and Mrs Suddaby called on Inspector Barry here, and were informed by him that we had no confirmation of their appointment or approval for them to proceed to take up the positions for which their Church had nominated them at Canyon City. Inspector Barry however gave them all the help he could with regard to the classroom work that would be required and wrote on the 10th of September to Indian Agent Collison with regard to his interview with these people.\n\nI am informed by Inspector Barry that Mrs Suddaby was trained in the Regina Normal School in 1929-30 and holds an interim certificate in Saskatchewan and in Alberta, but has no B.C. qualifications. Her total experience extends to a little over two years, mainly in Alberta. Her inspector's reports are not very satisfactory though for a beginner indicate that with training the girl might train later into a successful teacher.\n\nI am informed that she did not impress Inspector Barry as a very good candidate for the vacant Gwinaha position.\nIt appears from Brigadier Carruthers' letter that it would be most difficult to find a qualified teacher in the Salvation Army who would be available at this late date to go to the Gwinaha Indian Day School.\n\nUnder the circumstances, and after discussing the matter with Inspector Barry, I would recommend that Mrs. Suddaby be appointed as temporary teacher of the Gwinaha Indian Day School for the period October 1st to May 31st, 1939.\n\nI believe that the authorities of the Salvation Army should be informed that, while under the circumstances this nomination is being approved by the Department, it is not considered that Mrs. Suddaby holds the necessary B. C. qualifications and that such appointment can only be of a strictly temporary nature, with the provision that a teacher with acceptable B. C. qualifications be nominated to take Mrs. Suddaby's place for the academic year 1939-40.\n\nIn conclusion may I point out that Inspector Barry, in his last report on the Gwinaha Indian Day School forwarded to the Department under my file 15/48930 on May 17th, 1937, recommended that the School be only operated for eight months of each academic year, October 1st to May 31st. As there are hardly any pupils at Canyon City in September and June, it would be better not to attempt to operate a school there during these months.\n\nI would ask that the Department's final decision with regard to the opening of the Gwinaha Indian Day School and the appointment of Mrs. Suddaby as teacher be sent to Indian Agent Collison by night lettergram.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nCopy sent to Commissioner MacKay\n\nOttawa,\nOctober 5, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a copy of your letter of September 2 last addressed to Mr. W. E. Collison, Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B. C.\n\nThe Department has recently decided to approve the appointment of Mrs. Suddaby as teacher of the Gwinaha School for the academic year 1938-39. It is understood, however, that other arrangements will have to be made for the academic year 1939-40.\n\nIn the first place our regulations do not favour the employment of married women whose husbands are in a position to support them and in the second place I understand that Mrs. Suddaby does not possess British Columbia qualifications. In view of the fact that there are so many fully qualified teachers out of employment at the present time I think you will realize how difficult it is for us to justify the appointment of teachers who do not possess the requisite academic qualifications.\n\nI am also informed by Indian Commissioner MacKay that a great majority of the Indians are not on the Reserve during the months of June and September. Under these circumstances I am advised that it would be in the best interests of all parties concerned to only conduct the school for an eight-month period; namely, from October 1 to May 31. In nominating a teacher to take charge of this school for the academic year 1939-40 please be guided by the fact that the Gwinaha School will only be in operation, during the academic year 1939-40, from October 1 to May 31.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBrigadier W.

On April 26th the Brigadier called at the office and stated that Captain and Mrs. Suddaby desired a transfer and asked that after I had visited them at Canyon City I write and give him my reaction to the situation. I found the Suddabys emphatic in voicing their desire for a change. I considered, therefore, that it would be better for them to move rather than return and be dissatisfied and lose interest in their work.\n\nIf any question of school management had been involved I would naturally have reported this to the Commissioner only, and directly. In this case, however, it was simply and entirely a case of desire for a transfer from the Suddabys themselves on which the Brigadier had asked for my opinion.\n\nI advised Captain Suddaby when at Canyon City that if they intended to leave, the Department would require a resignation. This has now come to hand and is herewith attached.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. Gillett\nIndian Agent\n\nJG:F\n\nMajor D.M.

Suddaby, dated June 24th, and would recommend that this be accepted. No doubt the Salvation Army authorities will make a nomination of a suitable teacher to fill the vacant position in due course, although I may add that I have not communicated with them myself.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

He recently began duties at this school and he requested us, in a letter dated October 26, to forward his cheque to the Bank of Commerce, Prince Rupert, for deposit to his personal account. You will be receiving a similar cheque at the end of each month and I trust that this letter will enable you to properly credit it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

As you state the cheques were sent direct to the Bank of Commerce and they returned them to Ottawa. However, a letter dated December 30 was written to the Manager of the Bank of Commerce at Prince Rupert explaining the transaction and I feel certain that the bank will handle the cheques properly in future. However, it might be advisable for you to interview him and ask him to show you our letter of December 30.\n\nR.A.

Hagglund, teacher at the Gwinaha (Canyon City) Indian Day School, I would advise that his cheques have been sent direct to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, and they in turn have returned them to Ottawa, as uncalled for. There has apparently been some misunderstanding in this matter and it has caused embarrassment to Capt. Hagglund, as he has written cheques on his account and they have been returned. I would, therefore ask that his cheques be sent direct to this office by return Air Mail, and we shall deposit them to his credit at the above mentioned Bank.\n\nJ.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the Gwinaha Day School, it has been decided to reduce the basic salary of the teacher from $75.00 to $65.00 a teaching month. You understand, of course, that he will be paid a bonus, but there will be deductions for the retirement fund and income tax. The net amount payable to him each month will be in the vicinity of $70.00. In recent years we have been closing this school at the end of May, but I presume that the teacher will expect to stay until the end of June. However, you might let me have definite information on this point later in the year.\n\nR.A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nNovember 13, 1943.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Gwizaha Indian Day School\nNo. 812\n\nIt has been decided to decrease the basic salary of Captain Sigvard Hagglund, teacher of the above-mentioned school, from $75.00 to $65.00 a teaching month, effective December 1, 1943.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter received from Mr. Indian Agent Gillett regarding the attendance at the Gwinaha Indian Day School. The teacher at this little school is Captain Haddlund.\n\nIt will be observed that the departure of four families from the Reserve will reduce the number of children available to attend to five. Under these circumstances, it would appear that we should either close the school at the end of the first half of the current school year or allow the school to continue in session on the understanding that for the balance of the academic year the teacher would receive not more than $70.00 per month from the Department. In view of the fact that the parents remaining on the Reserve are anxious for the school to remain open and are prepared to contribute to the teacher's salary to the extent mentioned by Mr. Gillett and, also, that the drop in the attendance will be due to the parents of some of the children accepting employment in war work away from the Reserve, I am inclined to favour the latter alternative and would recommend that this arrangement be approved.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nOctober 29th, 1948.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nRE: Gwinaha (Canyon City) School.\n\nOn October 24th I visited the above named school. Up to that date, there had been eight children who had actually put in appearance at the school and who were present at the time of my visit. The number that should attend is twelve.\n\nFour families will be leaving Gwinaha Reserve and will be working either at Prince Rupert or Port Edward. They will be away until spring when they may return just to plant their gardens. There will not be more than five children at this school from November on. It was pointed out to the people, that, in view of this fact, the Department may consider it advisable to dispense of the services of a teacher. Rather than have this happen, the people suggested that they would pay $20.00 per month towards the teacher's salary.\n\nI have since interviewed Brigadier Gillingham of the Salvation Army and he states that, while the Headquarters of the church do not favour the idea of having an officer with so few people, he did not think they would move him this year. He also stated that the $20.00 reduction would not cause any embarrassment to the teacher, Captain Haddlund, even if the Indians did not pay the $20.00 monthly, as it appears that the teacher's cheque is passed on to the church which in turn pays him approximately $70.00 a month.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I consider the Department would be justified in reducing his salary.\n\nJ.

If the people should move away in April, Miss Bailey could return to Kitselas for at that place the attendance always keeps up in May and June, for the families do not move to the canneries.\n\nIf the transfer is approved, it will be necessary to take quick action so that Miss Bailey can be transported to Canyon City before the river freezes over.\n\n\"J.

In view of this information the following overpayments have been made:\n\n| Date          | Description                          | Amount |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------|--------|\n| Sept., 1943   | Salary and bonus overpaid            | $87.75 |\n| Feb. 15-29, 1944 | Salary overpaid                      | $33.62 |\n|               | Bonus                                | $5.72  |\n|               | Tax to be refunded                    | $39.34 |\n|               |                                      | $3.91  | $35.43 |\n| Mar.          | Salary and bonus overpaid            | $76.05 |\n|               | Less tax to be refunded              | $7.55  | $68.50 |\n| Apr. 1-26, 1944 | Salary overpaid                      | $56.33 |\n|               | Bonus                                | $9.58  |\n|               |                                      | $55.91 | $59.37 |\n|               | Less tax to be refunded              | $6.54  |        |\n\nOVERPAID - $251.05\n\nIt has been our practice to allow teachers who have been in our employ for some time one month's leave of absence with pay. Consequently we have decided to consider the payment made for the month of September as the month's sick leave. The amount overpaid in September, namely, $87.75, may be deducted from $251.05, leaving a balance of $163.30. I note that Captain Hagglund is\nOttawa,\nJune 23, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Gwinsha Indian Day School\nNo. 812\n\nCaptain Hagglund closed the school on May 31, 1944, and will not be returning to duty. No further payment of salary should be made to him.\n\nI will advise you later regarding the name of the teacher who will be in charge of the school for the academic year 1944-45.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nI enclose herewith the school return for Canyon City for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1944. This school closed on May 31st which has been customary for a number of years. It will be noted that the average attendance at this school during May was very low, in fact, low throughout the year. There were only six children in the village and others were away with their parents who were working at the various places of industry. There are twenty children of school age (from 6 - 15 years) belonging to this Band. As far as we can ascertain now there should be at least fifteen children in the village next winter as a number of the families who were away last winter will be going home. I recommend that another teacher be appointed beginning the 1st of October to replace Capt. Hagglund whose resignation has been transmitted through the Commissioner's office.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI beg to forward herewith a letter from Captain A.S. Hagglund resigning as teacher of the Gwinaha Day School, effective May 31, 1944, together with a copy of a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Gillett forwarding the resignation to this office.\n\nIt will be observed from Mr. Gillett's letter that he anticipates that at least 15 children will be available to attend this school next year. Under these circumstances, I have requested the Salvation Army to nominate another teacher.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n/KT\n\nEncl. 2\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nJune 12th, 1944.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI enclose herewith in duplicate Capt. Haglund's resignation as teacher at Gwaiha (Canyon City) school.\n\nThe average attendance at this school from October 1st to May 30th was 4.98. The number of children belonging to this Band of school age (from 6-15 years) is twenty. For the past seven months, however, most of the children were away with their families who were working at the various places of industry. On inquiries made recently, I would anticipate at least 15 children in the village next year, as the cannery building work at Fort Edward, at which place most of the Canyon City people were, is now completed and they will be remaining in the village. This will be checked again in September. I would recommend that the Salvation Army nominate another teacher.\n\nJ.G.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Gwinaha and Kitselas\nYour file 168-33-1 (E.1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of July 9th information has now been received from Superintendent Anfield to the effect that many of the Kitselas Indians with families of school age children may move from the Village in the near future, in view of which it is considered it would be unwise at this time to transfer Mr. A.J. Walker to the Kitselas School. It is anticipated that the Gwinaha school will require a teacher to a greater extent than Kitselas and I would recommend that Mr. Walker be re-appointed to Gwinaha for one more year.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nJuly 9, 1948.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 5th instant, we approve the transfer of A.J. Walker from the Gwinaha Indian Day School, effective September 1st, 1948.\n\nIt is hoped that you will be able to nominate another teacher for the Gwinaha School before September 1st.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MOD\nOttawa, June 21, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant\nwith reference to re-opening the Gwaiha Day School for\nthe academic year 1946-47.\n\nProvided the Salvation Army is prepared to\nnominate a qualified teacher, we are willing to have\nthis school re-opened. Salary of $90.00 a month plus\nbonus would be allowed.\n\nIf you receive a suitable nomination\nwhich would permit the school being re-opened, authority\nis granted for the expenditure of $75.00 for necessary\nrepairs to the building.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of June 4th in connection with the available pupilage for attendance at the Gwinaha Indian Day School next Fall. Inspector Coleman recently had an opportunity of discussing this school with Brigadier Gillingham of the Salvation Army and I would recommend that the Department authorize opening the school and employment of a teacher at a salary in line with that being paid other teachers where accommodation is provided. I would suggest a salary of $90.00 per month plus cost-of-living bonus.\n\nYou will note from Mr. Anfield's letter that he estimates the cost of necessary repairs to the school building at $75.00. I would ask that an accountable advance be forwarded to him.\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6391, File 812-1, part 2)\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nJune 4th, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C.,\nVancouver,\n\nThere is a definite indication that at least 15 children will be available for attendance at Canyon City this fall and it is recommended that the school be re-opened if a teacher can be secured. This appointment has been discussed informally with Brigadier Gillingham of the Salvation Army and he is taking steps to present the nomination to the Department for this post. A review of the file shows that a basic salary of $75.00, plus cost of living bonus, was paid to the last incumbent at this school and Brigadier Gillingham has been informed of this rate of salary. It is understood that there are sufficient school supplies on hand to start the school and maintain it for most of the winter.\n\nThe building in which this school is situated was given to the Department by the Indians and it is noted that a small grant towards the maintenance and repairs has been made from time to time. In view of the fact that this school has been closed for at least two years, it is recommended that a sum not to exceed $75.00 be authorized for repairs to the roof, floors, new stove pipes, grates and windows. As practically all these repairs will be for labor, an accountable cheque for this amount is requested when a decision is made by the Department regarding the opening of the school.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nTraining.\n\nIn February a school was established at Port Edward, at which place there are a number of Indians employed in a fish cannery. It is functioning very satisfactorily and looks as if it will be a permanent affair.\n\nGwinaha has not a teacher, and the Kitselas teacher was transferred to Port Edward, as the attendance at Kitselas had dwindled to three.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON SKEENA RIVER AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER, 1944\n\nSchools:\n\nPort Simpson Residential and Day Schools were visited by the Agent, also Kincolith and Metlakatla schools. Miss Rogers, who is the cook at the Crosby Girls' Home, is now in charge of that school, and Miss McRea has been appointed to take Miss Rogers' place.\n\nDue to navigation difficulties, it was not possible to have Miss Bailey transferred to Gwinaha school, nor Miss Anna Schmidt to Zakalsap school.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour File 168-33-1\n\nFurther to my letter of January 10th regarding Captain Louisa Bailey's return to the Kitselas Indian Day School, I enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's letter of January 13th wherein he recommends that the Kitselas School be kept open until the end of February at which time it may be possible to transfer Captain Bailey to Gwinaha should the pupilage warrant.\n\nAs the enrollment at Kitselas is not likely to drop below five and as Captain Bailey is doing considerable welfare work, it is recommended that she continue as teacher at Kitselas until the end of February.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.,\nJanuary 13th, 1945.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., VANCOUVER.\n\nRe: Kitselas School.\n\nI would recommend that Captain E.L. Bailey be retained as teacher for Kitselas School. It is true that there are only five pupils on the roll at present. From September to December, 1944, the enrolment and average attendance was as follows:\n\n| Month    | Number on Roll | Average Attendance |\n|----------|----------------|--------------------|\n| September| 5              | 5                  |\n| October  | 6              | 5.3                |\n| November | 5              | 4.9                |\n| December | 5              | 5                  |\n\nThe enrolment is not likely to go below five, but there is a possible chance that one family will return to the village who has two children. I think some consideration should be given to the fact that Captain Bailey is doing welfare work as well as teaching, and her influence in the village is for good.\n\nI would still favor the idea of having her transferred to Canyon City in March, when it is anticipated that the river will be navigable, that is, providing the people can guarantee ten pupils there for March, April and May.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJG/K.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of December 1st approving the transfer of Captain Louisa Bailey from the Kitselas Indian Day School to the Gwinaha Indian Day School.\n\nI am now advised by Mr. Indian Agent Gillett that due to the freeze-up of the river Captain Bailey was unable to reach the Gwinaha School and has, therefore, returned to Kitselas. In view of Provincial School Inspector Thorsteinsson's report of October 6th on this school, it would appear that the pupilage would not warrant payment of a teacher's salary at this point but I have written to Mr. Gillett asking him to let me have a definite recommendation with respect to the continued operation of this school and will advise you in due course.\n\nD.M.

In reply I beg to say that her resignation is accepted.\n\nIt appears from the correspondence forwarded with your letter that it will not be possible to secure a qualified teacher for the amount we have been allowing, viz., $60 a month, less 10%. The Department agrees that there is not much value in employing unqualified teachers. At the same time, owing to a recent ruling of the Treasury Board, it is not possible for the Department to increase the salary at this school during the current fiscal year. Under these circumstances, the school should remain closed for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.

It is further noted that you intend to visit Gwinaha at the end of this month. Following your visit, you should report to the Department regarding Miss Weeks' qualifications, stating if you would recommend that the same salary be paid her as was allowed the previous teacher.\n\nArrangements are being made to order from the Government Stationery Office the supplies requested on the requisition previously forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIn a report received from A. J. Walker, teacher of the Gwinaha Indian Day School, he states as follows:\n\n\"After the Christmas holidays the weather turned very cold and miserable, our children were running home during recess to get a hot drink so I thought that it would be a better idea if I were to make a pot of cocoa every day and serve it to them in the school during the morning, thus keeping them warm and satisfied. This has proved very satisfactory as it has also done away with them returning from their homes late for the next session and everybody seems quite happy about it. Now I understand that the Indian Department will provide this when necessary, therefore I am wondering if you will get the ration board to send me up sufficient sugar coupons to see me through till the end of March. There are sixteen children getting the benefit of this idea.\"\n\nAuthority is requested to purchase the following supplies to enable this health measure to be continued:\n\n- 25 lbs. of cocoa\n- 50 lbs. of sugar\n- 2 cases of canned milk.\n\nThe weather on the Naas River this winter has been very severe with temperatures as low as 32\u00b0 below zero. I am sure that this action on the part of this teacher will help to maintain good health at this little village.\n\nF.

An accountable advance of $155.00 will be forwarded to Superintendent Anfield.\n\nThe repairs which you recommend for the schools in the Skeena Agency are being authorized, and I would point out that the total amount involved is slightly over $3,200.00. Actually we only included in our appropriation an amount of $3,100.00 for repairs to the day schools in the Skeena Agency, and consequently, it is hoped that there will be no further heavy expenditure required at the schools in this Agency during the current fiscal year.\n\nBernard F.

Will it be in order to pay the Gordon and Anderson invoice from this advance?\n\nAn inspection of the School was made recently and as the Indians and teacher had made some repairs on a voluntary basis it is anticipated that there will be a sufficient balance to meet the Gordon and Anderson account.\n\nYour instructions are requested.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nFollowing receipt of information from the teacher of the Gwinaha Indian Day School that some articles had been provided for use at the teacher's residence, I wrote to Mr. Indian Agent Anfield for details for our files. Mr. Anfield's letter of November 18th is enclosed from which it will be noted that part of an accountable advance of $75.00 forwarded to the Agent by the Department for repairs and minor supplies was used for the supply of furnishings and other articles.\n\nIt is considered essential that this office have on file information with respect to equipment and furnishings at Indian Day Schools and teachers' residences and also details with respect to repairs carried out from time to time. Mr. Anfield's request for an advance should have been referred to this office and it would be appreciated if the Department would in future on receipt of such requests ask the Agent to take the matter up through the Commissioner otherwise it is not seen how this office can function as it should in such matters. I am writing to Mr. Anfield advising him that it will be in order for him to pay the account of Gordon and Anderson referred to from the balance of the accountable advance.\n\nD. M.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nAIRMAIL:\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Anfield's letter of July 31st and list of furnishings required for the Gwinaha Indian Day School teacherage.\n\nMr. Anfield's comments with respect to the condition of the present furnishings are noted, and although no provision was made in the estimates, I would recommend that, if funds are available, an expenditure of $212.50 be approved.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncls.\n-ms.\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nApplication is made to purchase the following furniture for the Gwinaha Indian Day School. Prices have been obtained locally from Gordon & Anderson.\n\n| Item                                      | Price   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|\n| 2 linoleum floor covering 9x8              | $18.00  |\n| 1 \"                                       | 13.50   |\n| 11x12                                     |         |\n| One dresser with mirror for bedroom       | $15.00  |\n| One bed with spring and mattress          | $7.00   |\n| One living room table                     | $6.50   |\n| One rocking chair                         | $3.00   |\n| One heater for living room                | $2.25   |\n| One bathroom scale for weighing school pupils | $1.50   |\n\nTotal: $212.50\n\nThis is a very old house and the furniture therein is pretty well worn out. There are no floor coverings; beds are old iron type and badly sagged. The present heater is the cheap air tight type and is not safe. There was a fire in the house last winter caused by the collar of the stove having burned through, and the stove pipes having dropped down.\n\nThe Walkers are returning to this village at the end of August. They did good work last year in both School and village and it is considered that the furniture requested should be supplied.\n\nThe Department's instruction will be appreciated.\n\nF.

The grant will be available from the 1st October last and payable on receipt of the usual quarterly returns.

(RG 10, Volume 6392, File 813-1, part 1)\nMy very dear Sir,\n\nI want to remind you of your promise to see us through with a school-house this spring. Mr. Whittington has just left Fortitamaat from here urged me to immediately write you.\n\nA School-house has become altogether imperative. Think of 27 Indian children in our little Mission Room for from 4 to 5 hours every day for upwards 2 weeks. Last quarter as you will see from the Register our average was 22-20. May I say that this exceedingly high average was not easily obtained or maintained but by carefully following up the children & the parents by thoughtful handling of them when they came. I believe we have done almost as good as was to be expected under existing conditions.\n\nAnd I am confident you are not willing that I should have to continue to teach under such insanitary circumstances. You are prepared to do all you can to strengthen my hands. I am already indebted to you for many kindnesses shown. So I briefly yet most earnestly ask you to do your best to secure me at your very earliest convenience.\n\n1st a sufficiency for substantial School-house\n2nd ... to furnish same.\n\nI am inclined to think there will be even a greater number of children coming to school next year. I would suggest $600 as a suitable cost of house. And anything from $50 - $100 to build furnish it. Please let me know very earliest moment when money will be available, as we\nwant to get it immediately fixed up.\n\nThe people have promised to give us care back of the Church.\n\nWe await your presence to have the agreement. At present\nthe people are away hunting - but will be back in April.\n\nI trust you are well of family. Am glad to say we are\n\nOur very kindest regards\n\nSincerely Yours\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would refer the Department to page 5 of the estimates already named and to the correspondence therein specified for fuller details concerning the necessity for providing new school buildings at these several localities without unnecessary delay. I may add that the majority of the buildings referred to, now old and decayed and, therefore, beyond the possibility of effecting repairs to them, were even from the beginning not at all suited for the purpose for which they have so long been used. I, therefore, trust that adequate provision will be made by the Department, if possible in its estimates for the approaching fiscal year, for substantial structures at the various places named by the Agent as well as in the two villages in the Babine agency which are likewise specified in the estimates referred to from this office for the coming year.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.

(file No. 265.800/I, or 274.440) I have the honor to forward herewith a communication, of the 5th of the present month, received from Mr. Agent Morrow, of the North West Coast Agency, B. C., covering an application, of the 20th ultimo, made to him by the Rev. H. W. W. Bromwick, methodist missionary in charge at Hartley Bay for a new Indian day school building for that place. It will be noted from a perusal of Mr. Bromwick's letter that he mentions $600.00 as the probable cost of a new structure and $100.00 for furnishing the same, upon completion of the building, whereas the Agent inserts an item in his letter of $800.00, which he probably regards as the figure more nearly approximating the actual requirements of the locality.\n\nIn regard to this item and others which Mr. Morrow particularly mentions\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 25, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th inst., with inclosures, relative to the establishment of day schools at certain points in the Northwest Coast agency, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is not in a position to give a decided answer in this connection until the supplementary estimates are passed.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.D.

I have no information as to a possible successor. As the Methodist Church has the nomination of a teacher for this place, doubtless the Department will ascertain what is being contemplated for this village by the Church authorities.\n\nChas. C.

If this is so, it will be necessary to obtain the services of a teacher to succeed him.

He is willing to return and take up this work at the close of vacation. The salary for teaching is to be $600.00.\n\nI trust this will be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\n\nTF/GD\nOttawa. August 22, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, nominating Mr. Mathews as teacher of the Hartley Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Mathews was in charge of that school before the war. The appointment of Mr. Mathews is approved and he will be allowed salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum, together with the bonus at the rate of $150.00 per annum during the time that this is continued to teachers in the Indian day schools.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.

C.\nOttawa, August 24, 1923.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Department has not yet received the June quarter return from the Hartley Bay Indian day school.\n\nIf this school was open during that quarter you should request the teacher to prepare and forward the usual quarterly return in order that the amount of salary and bonus due may be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nfor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Cellison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter (168-28-1) of the 24th ultimo, with regard to the June Quarter returns of the Hartley Bay Indian Day School. These returns have not yet been received. The Rev. J. H. Matthews, missionary at Hartley Bay, was requested several times by letter to prepare and forward the returns, but has not done so. Since writing, I understand that Mr. Matthews has been transferred to Kitamaat and has been succeeded by a Mr. Oliver, although I have not been officially informed of Mr. Oliver's appointment to the charge of the Hartley Bay School.\n\nThe school was only open during the month of April as all the Indians were away from the village during the months of May and June. The matter has been taken up further and I hope to be able to forward the returns as soon as received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nWEC/BB\nOttawa, Oct. 3, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 18th ultimo, I have to inform you that Rev.

The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $800 for the 10 teaching months and he will also be entitled to the bonus provided by law. Mr. Oliver has had previous experience in Indian schools and has good qualifications.\n\nRegarding the returns for the June quarter, we note that this school was open only during the month of April and that all the Indians were away during the months of May and June. If you can obtain a return for the period the school was open in the June quarter, the Department will be pleased to receive the same, in order that any amount of salary and bonus due can be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Collison, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPrince Rupert,\nB. C.\nOttawa, Oct. 3, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that Rev. T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, has nominated Mr. J. Oliver, M. A., for the position of teacher at the Hartley Bay Indian Day School. Mr. Oliver has had previous experience in Indian schools and, we understand, possesses good qualifications. The salary allowed him will be at the rate of $800 for the 10 teaching months and he will also be entitled to the bonus provided by law.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\n402 Holden Bldg.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, Oct. 3, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department approves of the appointment of Mr. J. Oliver, M. A., as teacher of the Hartley Bay Indian Day School. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $800 for the 10 teaching months, supplemented by the bonus provided by law. Both the local Indian agent and Mr. Inspector Cairns have been informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith, Return of the Hartley Bay Indian Day School for the Quarter ended June 30th, 1923.\n\nOn account of some misunderstanding following the transfer of Rev. J.H. Matthews from Hartley Bay to Kitamaat, and the appointment of Mr. James Oliver to succeed him, the Returns were not sent in, notwithstanding several letters from myself requesting that they be forwarded immediately.\n\nMr. Oliver reports that the school was not opened during the month of September, and I enclose blank returns for that Quarter, with Mr. Oliver's remarks.\n\nI hope to be able to visit the school by next month, as all the Indians will then be home.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nI shall be obliged if you can inform me of the whereabouts of my brother Mr. James Oliver who is mentioned in the Report on Indian Education for the year ended March 31st 1911, which he sent me at page 595 thereof, as being a teacher of the Indian Day School, Christian Island Reserve, Ontario.\n\nMy brother is a Master of Arts of the Sydney University and also a member of the New South Wales Bar. He was one of the most distinguished graduates of the University. The late Professor Charles Badham (Dean of the Faculty of Arts) said of him in a testimonial which he gave him \"At his examination for his degree Mr. Oliver was declared Gold Medallist, as standing far above all others in Classics.\" My brother also gained the Shakespeare Gold Medal offered by His Excellency the then Governor (Sir Hercules Robinson) to graduates of the University.\n\nIn May 1916 he posted me his portrait when he was presumably on his way back to Canada. As I have not heard from him for many years I shall be glad if you can locate him for me as I would like to hear from him as soon as possible.\n\nPerhaps the Young Men's Christian Association Secretaries might be able to give some clue to his movements, if he has resigned his position in your Department, as I have no idea.\n163 Phillip Street,\n\nSydney, 192\n\nHe should visit the local branch of the Y.M.C.A.\n\nWishing you a Merry Xmas and a Happy New Year\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAlbert D. Oliver\nOttawa, January 7, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd of November last, making enquiry as to the present whereabouts of your brother, Mr. James Oliver.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we have a James Oliver in our employ as teacher in an Indian school at Hartley Bay, British Columbia. His post office address is Hartley Bay, British Columbia. It is thought that this is the man of whom you are making enquiry.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nAlbert D. Oliver, Esq.,\nNorthfield Chambers,\n163 Phillip Street,\nSydney, New South Wales,\nAUSTRALIA.\nPrince Rupert, B.C., April 12, 1926\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to forward the following reports for the months of February and March.\n\nIn January Mr. James Oliver, teacher of the Hartley Bay School was obliged to undergo a serious operation in the Bella Bella Hospital which necessitated his absence from Hartley Bay for several weeks. I am glad to state that he has sufficiently recovered to resume his work. During part of his absence, the school was looked after by a native teacher.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\n163 Phillip Street,\nSydney, 4th November 1927\nNew South Wales\nAustralia.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am the brother of Mr. James Oliver, Master of Arts, and Scholar, of Sydney University, New South Wales, Australia, who was at the time when you replied to an inquiry of mine as to his whereabouts stationed in charge of the School under your Department at Hartley Bay, British Columbia.\n\nAs I have not heard from my brother for some considerable time, I shall be obliged if you will kindly inform me by return mail if my brother is still in charge of the School at Hartley Bay, and if not, where he is at present located, if still under your Department.\n\nMight I trespass on your goodness, and ask you to forward me copies of the last three years Annual Report of the Superintendent of Indian Education, if you have them available, at any rate, whatever you can send me.\n\nWould you also kindly forward to my brother the enclosed letter addressed to him by me?\n\nWishing you a Merry Xmas and a Happy New Year.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nAlbert D. Oliver\nOttawa, December 2nd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 4th ultimo concerning your brother, Mr. James Oliver, teacher of the Indian day school at Hartley Bay, B.C. I may say that your brother is still in our employ and is meeting with considerable success in his work. I am forwarding by today's mail your letter to him.\n\nI regret that we no longer print a special report on the Indian school activity, but I am forwarding to you, under separate cover, a copy of our latest annual report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nAlbert D. Oliver, Esq.,\nSolicitor,\n163 Phillip Street,\nSydney, New South Wales,\nAUSTRALIA.\nOttawa, December 2nd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing a letter from your brother in New South Wales which was sent to the Department for forwarding. I have informed your brother that you are in charge of the Indian day school at Hartley Bay, B.C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T.

D. Oliver, kindly forwarded to me by the Department through the Superintendent of Indian Education, and received last week.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJames Oliver\nSpecial Report in accordance with Departmental Letter 4-210 dated January 14, 1931, and attached to my Report on the Hartley Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn accordance with the instructions issued to me by the Department of Indian Affairs, I am forwarding this special report for the information of the Superintendent of Indian Education.\n\nI beg to state that I do not consider the services of Mr. James Oliver, at present teacher of the Hartley Bay Indian Day School, to be satisfactory. I have therefore requested that he be removed from his position at the above school at the earliest possible moment.\n\nIn my opinion Mr. Oliver is far too old to carry on the teaching work at this point, and owing to his lack of any professional training at a Normal School, is unable to give satisfactory service as a teacher in the above mentioned school. The present state of things at the Hartley Bay Indian Day School are set out in my report, and show a deplorable condition.\n\nThe matter of the removal of the present teacher was brought up in a conference at Prince Rupert a short time ago, by the Rev A. Barner of the United Church of Canada.\n\nShould the Department agree to the course I have here suggested, a suitable teacher to fill a vacancy at Hartley Bay can easily be suggested from the list of selected candidates in this office.\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\n\nVictoria, B.C.\nJune 15, 1932.\nEXTRACT from Inspector Barry's Report regarding his visit to the HARTLEY BAY INDIAN DAY SCHOOL on May 16th, 1932.\n\nOriginal on File 168-28-6.\n\nName:- Mr. James Oliver. Age 68.\n\nSalary:- $950 - The United Church gives $900.00 of this to the teacher. No doubt, the difference is placed as rent of the Mission House. He also gets $100.00 per annum as Post Master.\n\nQualifications:- M. A. Sidney University. Barrister at Law in N. S. Wales; First Class Honour Certificate as teacher in Nebraska. He never went to a Normal School, holds no certificate valid in Canada. This teacher has had 22 years experience in teaching, including 9 years at Hartley Bay.\n\nHealth is stated to be good. Had bad influenza lately (?) Was operated on for hernia at Bella Bella six years ago.\n\nSuccess:- Has no idea whatever of modern teaching. The school if I am to judge from the few children present is not properly graded. Conditions HOPELESS.\n\nNothing whatever could be done for this man. He is far too old to learn how to teach. He is perfectly useless in his present position.\n\nThe children use slates and the small children have no exercise books. I told the teacher he must obtain the prescribed Writing Manuals for all the children. The work of this school, if it can be called work, is not properly graded. There is no Course of Study available in the school. I believe that the teacher has an old one in his own home.\n\nRegister:- This was not completed as to the quarterly averages, etc., so these cannot be quoted. In other respects the register was well kept.\n\nGeneral: It is quite hopeless to report in any greater detail with regard to the work or lack of work of the children. I quite fail to understand why this man has been permitted to stay here as a teacher for so long. It is only fair to add that the Rev. A. Barner requested me to visit the school, as he considered a change necessary. In this I quite agree. I could do nothing whatever for this poor old man. He even had to go over to his own house to get some chalk for me to use in the schoolroom.\nOttawa, June 24, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nIn a report received from Mr. G. H. Barry, Inspector of Schools for British Columbia, on his recent inspection of the Hartley Bay Indian Day School, he states that the services of Mr. James Oliver, the teacher, are unsatisfactory and recommends a change in teaching services for the coming school year. Further, he is of opinion Mr. Oliver is too old to carry on teaching work, and, also, owing to lack of any professional training, he is unable to give satisfactory service.\n\nI would request that the matter of a change in teacher for the coming school year receive consideration. Mr. Barry has stated that a suitable teacher could be obtained from a list of selected candidates in his office. If you have no suitable teacher in view, I would suggest Mr. Barry be consulted regarding an appointment. I shall be pleased, at your convenience, to hear the result of any action taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth Beaton,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nJuly 5th,\n1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour File No. 168-28-1.\n\nYour communication stating that the Inspector of Schools for British Columbia finds the services of Mr. James Oliver, M.A., the teacher at Hartley Bay, unsatisfactory, is not much of a surprise to me. Mr. Oliver, however, has been with the Department and the Board of Home Missions for a number of years and I do not know whether we are in a position to dispense with his services quite so summarily as this. I am writing to Rev. Arthur Barner, asking him for some information as to the type of agreement that was made with Mr. Oliver when he entered our services. As soon as I get a reply from him, I will communicate with you again.\n\nBelieve me\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\nJune 28, 1932.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, and may say that applications are now coming in from a good class of United Church girls. Some of these teachers will be attending my lectures at the forthcoming Provincial Summer School in Victoria. A copy of the Summer School programme is being forwarded to you under separate cover as you may be interested in the Courses we are giving here. I can find no trace of your letter with regard to the Kitselas and Fort Simpson schools but in these cases I shall later make recommendations on the authority of your letter of June 20th. I am delaying these recommendations at present as I wish to get better acquainted with the candidates attending Summer School in order that I may make a more satisfactory choice.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Gerald H. Barry\"\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nReverend A. Barner,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St., West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nJuly 15, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of July 8th in reply to my 15/25462, dated June 28th.\n\nWith regard to your second paragraph, I may say that Mrs. Snodgrass, the teacher of the Indian Day School at Bella Coola, is at present attending my course of lectures at the Provincial Summer School for Teachers in Victoria. Mrs. Snodgrass is making every effort to become acquainted with the better methods now being used in rural schools. While I am still of the opinion that Mrs. Snodgrass is not in good health and that it would be much better to have a younger and better trained teacher at Bella Coola, I am in full agreement with both the Department of Indian Affairs and yourself that it is now much too late to dispense with Mrs. Snodgrass' services before the end of the next school year in January 1933. In any case I shall not have an opportunity of again inspecting her school before the spring of next year. Beyond warning this teacher that the report of the last inspection on her school was not considered satisfactory, I would recommend that no further action be taken until I have had an opportunity of again reporting to the Department on the Bella Coola Indian Day School.\n\nWith regard to the case of Mr. James Oliver, the teacher of the Hartley Bay Indian Day School, I regret to say that I see no reason to in any way modify my report to the Department on this teacher. It is absolutely essential that the services of Mr. Oliver as a teacher in the Indian schools be terminated at the first possible opportunity. I agree with you that as Mr. Oliver has proceeded for his location, believing that he would be returning to work in the Hartley Bay School on the 1st September, nothing further can be done with regard to replacing him before the end of the present calendar year. There can, however, be no doubt that Mr. Oliver is utterly unsuitable as a teacher of young children and I would advise that one of the specially selected candidates now on my list of applicants or in attendance at the Provincial Summer School, be selected to replace him as from January 1st, 1933.\n\nI regret very much that it was not possible to report to the Department on these teachers at an earlier date. The work in the office has so greatly increased during the past year that I am now four or five weeks behind hand with my reports. The correspondence is increasing daily and there is a constant stream of applicants for personal interviews as well.\n\nRev. Kenneth J.

Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools,\nP.O. Box 666,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Barry:\n\nYour letter of June 26th, addressed to our Mr. Berner, has been received in his absence on a visit to some of our Indian Missions in Northern Manitoba. It is unlikely that Mr. Berner will be back in the office before the end of August, and in the meantime I shall be responsible for the administration of any matters that occur in connection with our Indian work. We shall be looking forward to receiving your letter with recommendations for appointments to our schools where there are vacancies.\n\nI am in receipt of letters from the Department at Ottawa, in which they state that you have decided that the services of Mrs. Snodgrass at Bella Coola and of Mr. James Oliver, M.A., at Hartley Bay, are unsatisfactory. It is not quite clear whether it is your intention that these teachers should be dismissed forthwith or not. I have seen that after having visited most of these places on the Pacific coast last summer, I am quite inclined to agree with you in regard to both of these teachers. The difficulty is - especially in the case of Mr. Oliver - that they have served the Department and the Church to the best of their ability over a long period of years; and they have closed school and gone on vacation with the full expectation of returning to work the 1st of September. The financial situation is such that there is no hope at so late a date of their being able to obtain employment this fall. The plan which was followed in the case of Miss Morrise, who was given six months' notice, is very much more in harmony with the principles under which we ordinarily approach such changes in personnel. While I would be very glad to think that we had younger and more competent teachers in these two schools, I am wondering if we might not allow Mrs. Snodgrass and Mr. Oliver to carry on at least to the end of the school year. I feel quite sure that there would be no difficulty in your obtaining quite satisfactory teachers for the opening of school after the Christmas vacation. As a matter of fact, throughout the rest of Canada we have never had teachers of as high a calibre applying for work in Indian Schools as at the present time.\n\nAssuring you that we appreciate your co-operation and are very sincerely desirous of bringing our Indian schools up to the full standard of the Public School system in British Columbia.\n\nI am\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n\"Kenneth J.

Rev. Mr. Beaton, of Toronto, has been informed that the Department consurs in the retention of the services of Mrs. Snodgrass at Bella Coola for the coming academic year. In the event that her services are not desired after the end of June, next, please see that your recommendation reaches the Department in time to notify her to that effect.\n\nMr. Beaton is being informed that the services of Mr. Oliver, at the Hartley Bay Indian Day School, should be terminated at the end of the calendar year. He will be asked to nominate a suitable successor, who will commence duties on January first, next. It is probable that he will write to you for assistance in connection with this nomination.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nGerald H.

He will be asked to nominate a suitable successor, who will commence duties on January first next. We protest that he will write to you for assistance in connection with this nomination.\"\n\nI also refer you to the second paragraph of July 8th addressed to this office.\n\nMay I be permitted to recommend to the Board of Directors consideration be given to the application of Mr. Robert Davy, 156 South Turner Street, Victoria, B.C., whose resignation has forwarded his letter of application and letters from United Church authorities direct to me.\n\nMr. Davy is far more mature than the usual young man seeking teaching position in our Indian schools. He is 24 years of age, and is Secretary of the James Bay United Church, and in church he also attends. His father is a minister, and I believe Mr. Davy is heading towards the Ministry of the Gospel. I am anxious that the new teacher at Hartley Bay be able to conduct the usual Sunday services in the little chapel at the school, as well as many of those who have attended the school. Mr. Robert Davy is at present attending classes in Sunday School work given under the auspices of the Religious Education Council of Greater Victoria.\n\nMr. Davy had a year at the University of British Columbia, and received his training at the Victoria Bible Institute, where he received a First Class Interim Certificate. He was recommended to me by the Provincial Superintendent of Indian Affairs, and I thought to do well in the position. I am therefore recommending his appointment, and forwarding his application to the Board of Directors for their consideration.\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKenzie, Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nIn response to your request for information as to what our Board has done in regard to the teacher at Hartley Bay, I may say that following my letter of July 5th, I wrote Mr. James Oliver, who has been the teacher there for a number of years, telling him of our correspondence with Captain Barry and with the Department. I told him that originally it was Captain Barry's intention that he should not be re-engaged for the present school term but that we had proceeded on his behalf, in view of his long service with the Department, and it was mutually agreed that he should continue until December 31st. I asked him to advise me of receipt of this letter and of his plans for the future. Up to date, no reply has come to hand.\n\nAbout six weeks ago, I wrote Captain R.C. Scott of the Marine Ship, the Thomas Crosby, sending him a copy of my letter to Mr. Oliver and asking him to call at Hartley Bay at the earliest opportunity, to discuss the situation with the old man and report. There is scarcely time for a reply from Captain Scott to have been received. Until I hear that Mr. Oliver is accepting the suggestion that he retire on December 31st, with good grace and has some reasonable hope of being able to provide for himself in the future, I do not feel like nominating a teacher.\n\nI have received Captain Barry's letter, also an application from the young man to whom he refers, Mr. Robert Davey, as well as several recommendations. I have no hesitation in saying that the suggestion of Mr. Davey's appointment appeals to us here and I am hopeful that arrangements can be amicably made so that he can take over the school on January 1st.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

In reply I beg to say I have informed Mr. Inspector Barry of the contents of the above mentioned letter.

In addition to this, I gathered from some rather vague remarks in the letter that my lack of a Canadian diploma (without which, I may indicate here, I had worked under your Department for 22 years, during which I had held a First Class School Diploma from the Education Department of the State of Nebraska W. J. C.) and the fact of my being no longer a young man were further reasons for your Department's action. The Home Mission Department added that it had thoroughly\nThe Indian Department's extremely annoying procedure, and as a result had secured the assurance that I should retain my position until the end of 1832. I need hardly say that I deeply resented the suspicion as both ignorantly inaccurate and unjust (to characterize it as no worse) and in any Quarterly Report in September 1832 I denounced it, with the assurance that I would deal with it at a more convenient season. I did not further trouble. I decided to defer all comment till my connection with the Indian Department should be ended, so that any failure during my further tenure of the position of teacher might be avoided.\n\nThe past two months have been so occupied with settling my affairs in Canada, and removing here, and settling down in London that it is only now I can fulfill the above promise, which I should on no account avoid keeping. My remaining for a further period, till June 1833, on the failure of the measure to secure a successor to me in December 1832, has nothing to do with the subject save to show the reason of my long silence.\n\nIn May 1831 your Inspector visited Shortly days. He asked me certain formal questions as to my status as a teacher. His manner was as cordial and affable as a plain-clothes police officer in making an arrest. Then he inspected the school (save the walls!) if one can call such a performance an inspection.\nThere were but 5 scholars present\u2014of 7, 8, 8, 9 and 13 years of age respectively\u2014-the first or nearly so better than beginners, though their signatures of residence on or absence from the Reserve; the last a scholar of only fair mentality. The inspector seemed to ignore any explanation that some of scholars, the best in the school, were away gathering edible seaweed, which kept them the best of a meal to do. They followed this custom during my 10 years' stay on the Reserve, and had done it before I came there. Unquestioned; but the inspector evidently set it down as merely ordinary bad attendance; though for 10 years I protested against it, and reported it every year. Four of these scholars had never seen an inspector; but he handed scraps of paper as questionnaires to children as familiar with their form of examination as with Egyptian hieroglyphics. He did everything very quickly; for he was all the time \"on the job\" to get done. His inspection in all subjects lasted about 20 minutes; the rest of the time was taken up in an account of his achievements among the New Canada Indians (children of foreign origin); but he evidently didn't know that there are cleverer, and more energetic, and ambitious by far, in intellectual work than the ordinary children) and in working out a lengthy list of test and exercise results; for in all, his time here was only between one and two hours.\nI am anxious to end this letter. The burden of his report was unsatisfactory. I want to give you the impression he himself made on the teacher, or careful observation. I set him down as a man with a thin veneer of education, a pruner in trees, or a kindergarten expert; a man without sympathy of any kind, and quite devoid of imagination; and as ignorant of the mentality, everyday facts, and defects of the Indians, generated by their natural environment, as he is of the capabilities of the people of this planet.\n\nI have ever felt deeply humiliated to have to rank as a subordinate, during these many years, to men unfit to loose my own patches in knowledge, experience, culture, and intellectual ability. I cannot still more say humiliation in the exquisite statement of an intellectual nobody, and my dismissal after twenty-three years of most faithful, self-denying, and uncomplaining service as unworthy, but for the missionary Society's intervention, as if I had been some incapable degenerate.\n\nWhen I left it the school was materially in a better state, and the children better disciplined, behaved, and taught than when I took charge ten years before; and in the process I had spent for building, bricks, lumber-material, and repairs at least two hundred dollars of my own money, without asking you for it; and I should not have asked for it even if you had not given me a retiring\ncheque, for which I now thank you.\n\nI have often thought the Indian Department (and some other Canadian institutions as well) ought to have written about its portals - all hope abandoned age who enter here; for in 23 years service I never received a word of commendation or appreciation from it.\n\nThe only thing of value in its eyes seems a Canadian diploma, which in other, civilian eyes is of little worth at all. The fact I was superior in academic honours to any man in your Department, or even, I might add, to any one the lists of your whole schools, counted for nothing. People elsewhere are much wiser than this and are not slow to observe.\n\nI may add in closing the words used by one of the former undersecretaries in communicating the news of your death in August 1752: \"In God's name how shall we repay you for all that you have done in the years gone by for us and our work among the Indian people.\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJames Oliver.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nRe: Salary Bonus - Mr. James Oliver, Hartley Bay.\n\nI hope it will be possible to get this cheque through within a few days. Mr. Oliver is still in Vancouver, but as we have no idea in regard to his future plans, I should like to forward this two months' salary bonus to him at the earliest possible date. I believe he has a brother in Australia, and he may be contemplating going there to retire.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention to this matter,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

Capt. Hagglund, teacher at Canyon City, became ill with appendicitis which necessitated his coming to Prince Rupert for an operation. He will be returning on the 12th of March. Mr. McComachie who had been ill and at Port Simpson Hospital has recovered and should be resuming duties as soon as weather conditions permit her to go to Greenville. She is at present at Kincolith.\n\nRev. Wilding is still substituting at the Crosby's Girl's Home and will continue to do so until the end of the school term. The attendance at the Port Simpson school was very low during the month due to a mild form of influenza.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nPORT ON SKEENA RIVER AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH, 1944.\n\nSchools:\nAll the schools with the exception of Gwinaha were functioning during the month. The teacher at Gwinaha had an operation for appendicitis. He could not return in March as anticipated owing to complications setting in. The School children at Hartley Bay bought War Saving Stamps to the value of $117.00 since the beginning of the term.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nI enclose herewith the School Return for the Hartley Bay Indian Day School for the quarter ended June 30th. It will be noted that this school did not function after May 9th, as the families with the children were away at a fishing camp. The teacher has the days present and the days absent based on teaching days, in spite of the fact that I have reminded him at various times that days present and days absent should total the number of school days in the quarter.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJG/k.\nOttawa,\nAugust 25, 1944.\n\nMr. J. Gillett, Indian Agent, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, in which you advise that the Hartley Bay School was not open after May 9, owing to the departure of the Indians to the fishing ground. Is this a condition that exists every year, or was this year the first on which it occurred? You will realize that it is difficult to be fair to all parties concerned when such a condition arises. It is almost impossible to secure a teacher for less than ten months in the academic year. It would be appreciated if you would review the situation at Hartley Bay at your convenience and let me have another report.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nREPORT ON SKEENA RIVER AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER, 1944.\n\nSchools:\n\nAgent visited Kincolith, Port Simpson, Port Essington and Hartley Bay Indian Schools, and also a white school at Inverness, where there are eight Indian children in attendance. The Hartley Bay schools had full attendance, while the others were only about fifty per cent. of what they should have been. The children were not in the villages but away with parents.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.,\nJanuary 23, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. Mackay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., VANCOUVER.\n\nYour File 215-8-8527 - Letter Jan. 17, 1945.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Inspector Thorsteinsson's report on Hartley Bay School, the interior would look brighter, no doubt, if it had a new coat of paint, but it is just a question whether it is worth while to incur any expenses on an old building, particularly if a new school is to be erected within the next year or so. I will place an item in the 1946-1947 Estimates to take care of this.\n\nRegarding the removal of trees on the west side of the school, I will leave that until I visit the place again to estimate the cost. Personally, I think there is sufficient light coming from the east side. However, it might give better light in the early morning if they were moved.\n\nThe attendance at Hartley Bay School is always good when the people are in the Village. In May, however, practically the whole Village moves away to camps for halibut fishing and seaweed gathering, and in September they are at the canneries. I do not know how this can be remedied until the people themselves begin to realize that it is worth while for the mothers to stay in the Village so that the children may attend school; or some scheme might be given consideration, whereby three or four families would stay home and board the children of the other families.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJG/k.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nFurther to my letter of January 17th regarding Provincial School Inspector Thorsteinsson's report covering his inspection of the Hartley Bay Indian Day School, I enclose herewith for your information copy of Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's letter of January 23rd in which he comments on the various points raised by the Inspector.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., VANCOUVER.\n\nMr. J. A. Findlay, teacher at Hartley Bay, has requested that he be given sick leave, beginning on the 23rd. He has not been very well this winter. He intends to go to Vancouver for medical treatment, including dental work. He does not anticipate returning until May 22nd. This period, he states, is an opportune time, as practically all the people are out of the village either halibut fishing or at Seaweed Camp.\n\nI recommend that his leave be approved.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJG/k.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing herewith letter dated April 18th from Mr. Indian Agent Gillett requesting that Mr. J. A. Findlay, teacher at the Hartley Bay Indian Day School, Hartley Bay, B.C. be granted for a period from April 23rd to May 22nd, 1945.\n\nI would recommend that this leave be approved, pending receipt of a medical certificate.\n\nfor D. M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, May 3, 1945.\n\nMr. J. Gillett, Indian Agent,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 18, addressed to Indian Commissioner MacKay, regarding sick leave for Mr. J. A. Findlay, teacher of the Hartley Bay School, the Department is prepared to allow him sick leave from April 23 to May 22, both days inclusive.\n\nAre we to understand that this school will not be re-opened during the current academic year? In this regard I would refer you to your letter of August 3, 1944, and official reply of August 25, 1944. No reply was received from you to the latter letter. Please let me have an immediate reply to this letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nCOPY SENT TO COMMISSIONER MacKAY\nPRINCE RUPERT, B.C.,\nMay 16, 1945.\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nYour File 168-28-1 - May 3rd.\n\nWith reference to the Hartley Bay School, my impression is that the school is not likely to function after Mr. Findlay's return, which will be on May 26th, as conditions there are the same as last year. I do not consider that the teacher's salary should be paid for June. I am writing Mr. Findlay today to let me know definitely when he returns how many children are in the village. 1944 was the first year that the people left the village en masse so early in May. Usually they remain at Hartley Bay until the 20th of June.\n\nI am suggesting to Mr. Findlay that he call at the Commissioner's office while in Vancouver.\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJG/k.\ncc. Major D.M. Mackay.\nOttawa, May 22, 1945.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nBox 80, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nOn May 8, I wrote to Indian Agent Gillett with reference to Mr. J. A. Findlay, teacher of the Hartley Bay Indian Day School. A copy of that letter was forwarded to you. I now enclose a copy of Mr. Gillett's reply, which I am not certain that he sent to you.\n\nYou will note his suggestion that Mr. Findlay should not be allowed salary for the month of June. What is your opinion of this? In one way it appears rather severe to cut off a month's salary due to circumstances over which Mr. Findlay has no control.\n\nEncl.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMajor D. M. Mackay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVANCOUVER.\n\nWe have moved to our office in the Federal Building. The situation has not improved with reference to work and continual callers.\n\nI have made enquiries here regarding securing of suitable person to act as constable and assistant, but up to the present have not been successful. May I recommend, if the Commissioner considers it advisable, that as Mr. Findlay is not likely to be teaching in June, that he be taken on temporarily?\n\nJ. Gillett,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's letter of May 16th wherein he suggests that Mr. J.A. Findlay, teacher of the Hartley Bay Indian Day school, be employed temporarily as Constable in the Skeena River Agency from June 1st. Mr. Gillett, in his letter of May 16th, in connection with the Hartley Bay school, your file 168-28-1, advised that it was not likely the school would re-open this term and, in the absence of any suitable applicant for the position as Constable, it is recommended that Mr. Findlay be employed temporarily at the maximum salary for the position. Please let me have an early reply.\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEnc.\nOttawa, May 26, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDeputy Minister.\n\nMR-IA9-93.\n\nThe permanent position of Constable, Indian Reserve, for the Skeena Agency, B.C., became vacant on June 1, 1943, on the retirement of Mr. Alfred John Watkinson, on account of ill health.\n\nThe vacancy was advertised in April, 1943, Competition No. 43-431, but no applications were received. Owing to war conditions, it was thought unlikely that anyone would be secured by re-advertisement of the position, and the Civil Service Commission advised the Department of its willingness to certify the appointment of any suitable person who could be secured locally. The position has remained vacant, although the need for additional assistance at the Skeena Agency is very apparent, not only for a Constable, but adequate office assistance, and the Indian Agent would welcome the appointment of a Constable, who, while not engaged in constable duties, would be able to assist him otherwise, in the agency work.\n\nAs the Indians leave for the fishing season, the Hartley Bay School is being closed with effect from June 1. It has been suggested by the Indian Agent, in which suggestion the Indian Commissioner concurs, that Mr. J. A. Findlay, the teacher at the Hartley Bay School be engaged as Constable and assistant to the Indian Agent.\n\nMr. Findlay, who has been employed as teacher since September 1, 1935, is paid salary at the rate of $95. per teaching month. He is also provided with living quarters. Major MacKay recommends that he be paid the maximum salary for the class, Constable, which is $1200. per annum. At this Agency we allowed the Constable $300. per\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6392, File 813-1, part 1)\nannum in lieu of house-rent.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Findlay be engaged at $1200. per annum, plus $300. per annum, in lieu of house-rent, and if you concur in this employment I will wire Major Mackay to engage Mr. Findlay on June 1, 1945.\n\nSgd.

A. Findlay, teacher of the Hartley Bay Indian Day School for the month of June, 1945.\n\nYou will by now have received my airmail letter of May 21st, recommending that as this School will likely be closed during June, Mr. Findlay be employed temporarily as Constable in the Skeena River Agency.

Anfield,\nIndian Agent.\n\nCopied:\nCS\nFollowing receipt of Mr. Neary's letter of June 25th I wrote to Mr. Indian Agent Infield asking him to advise as soon as possible whether Mr. Cantelon expected to be paid for the months of May and June. Mr. Infield's reply dated July 8th is enclosed, together with a memorandum dated July 10th from District School Inspector Deye. Although the agent has not secured the specific information requested, I am of the opinion that it would be advisable to pay this teacher for both May and June and would so recommend.\n\nThe teacher at the Hartley Bay Indian Day School is a nominee of the United Church and if we are unable to guarantee applicants a definite period of employment it will be almost impossible to secure a teacher at this point.\n\nI am writing to Mr. Infield with respect to Mr. Deye's suggestion that the Hartley Bay teacher be classified as a welfare teacher and follow the Indian migration to Rutedale to operate a school or to do welfare work during the period June 1st to September 30th.\n\nJUL 24 1947\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6392, File 813-1, part 1)\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nTo: The Indian Commissioner.\nFrom: Inspector of Indian Schools.\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Neary's letter dated June 25th, 1947. Attached is a letter from Mr. Indian Agent Anfield in reply to an enquiry as to whether or not Mr. Cantelon expects to be paid for the months of May and June. In view of the circumstances set forth in Mr. Anfield's letter, and because it will be difficult to employ and retain teachers if their salaries are to be paid for only part of the normal school term, I recommend that Mr. Cantelon's salary be paid for both May and June.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Anfield's recommendation that the Hartley Bay School operate only from October 1st to May 30th; during this latter month there is a movement to Butedale, about 30 miles from Hartley Bay, of Indians who remain at that point until the fall.\n\nI suggest that Mr. Anfield be asked to report on the advisability of using the teacher from Hartley Bay at Butedale, either to operate a school from May until October, or to do welfare work for that period. In either case the teacher could be classified as a Welfare Teacher, and his service fully used.\n\nR.F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools.\n\nEncs.\n\n;ms.\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B. C., Vancouver.\n\nRe yours of July 5th, 1947, file 12-11-2, Rev. W. R. Cantelon and wife were taken from Hartley Bay to Butedale on the \"Waskeena\" on the 4th instant, from which point they proceeded to Bella Bella where the reverend gentleman is to become the Missionary.\n\nMr. Cantelon informed me that the last day on which school was held was April 28; that on April 29th the entire village moved to the seaweed camps. He remained, hoping they would return, or at least enough of them to re-open the school. Apart from one day when the people came back for a funeral, the Cantelons have been the sole occupants of the village.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I would presume that Rev. W. R. Cantelon would expect to be paid at least for the month of May.\n\nIn 1945, when Mr. J. A. Findlay was the teacher, the School was closed on April 23rd.\n\nIn 1944, the School closed on May 9th.\n\nIn 1943, the School closed on May 17th.\n\nIf Mr. Findlay was paid to the end of the quarter, the president should stand. I have no information as to whether or not he was paid. It is recommended that the school be closed as from May 30th in future and re-opened October 1st, unless in the opinion of the Department, the short term of 8 months would make it impossible to obtain a teacher.\n\nF.

Tedlock, teacher at the Hartley Bay Indian Day School, it is anticipated that these forms will not reach you in time to have this teacher's name included in the pay list for September. Mrs. Tedlock is very anxious that there be no delay in receipt of her cheque as she has been put to considerable expense in connection with her fare to Hartley Bay and in securing supplies for a three month's period.\n\nIt would be appreciated if a special effort could be made to have Mrs. Tedlock's cheque forwarded to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Fairview Branch, 2148 Granville Street, Vancouver, promptly at the end of September.\n\nD.

Tedlock who was to leave on the 13th September to assume the duties of school-teacher at the above point.\n\nAt the present time the population of Hartley Bay consists of 175 Indians.\n\nMrs. Tedlock is an employee of the Department of Indian Affairs and is not a British subject. The Department requires Canadian citizenship for appointment to all Postmasterships except where no other person is available and there is no alternative but to appoint a non-Canadian. Also an existing Order provides that persons should not be in receipt of salaries from two government Departments.\n\nWould you be good enough to let the Department have your Minister's opinion and if a Post Office is required at the above point.\n\nYours truly,\n\nLudovic Germain,\nDirector of Operations.\nOttawa, October 2, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nEXECUTIVE ASSISTANT\n\nHartley Bay Post Office\n\nThe letter hereunder is self-explanatory. As you will note from the file, Mrs. Inez Tedlock is teacher of the Hartley Bay Indian Day School and has been so employed at a salary of $1,500.00 per academic year since 1 September, 1947.\n\nShe was born in Holt, Montana, in 1893 and after graduating from high school attended the normal school at Dillon, Montana. She has some 17 years' successful teaching experience in the United States and has enclosed references from both the present and former school superintendents of the County of Linn, in Oregon. It is my understanding that in the past the teacher of the Indian school at Hartley Bay has also been the post master. However, this may date before the time of the Order-in-Council mentioned in Mr. Germain's letter.\n\nBernard J.

Tedlock to act as Postmaster at that point.\n\nIt is understood here that in the past the teacher of the Indian School at Hartley Bay has held the position of Postmaster and secondly, it is noted that the Post Office Department is prepared to accept a clerk at our St. Regis Agency to act as Postmaster at that point, in view of which your reference to an existing Order which provides that persons should not be in receipt of salaries from two government Departments, is not understood.\n\nThere is certainly no objection from this Department to the school teacher at Hartley Bay school continuing to act as Postmaster, as indeed, a post office is essential, not only for the Indians but also for the work of this Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nExecutive Assistant,\nfor Director.\n\nLudovic Germain, Esq.,\nDirector of Operations,\nPost Office Department,\nOttawa.\n\nEA/ITH\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe last of Oct., I received a check for $6 for janitor for month of Sept.; nothing has been received since. Would you please look into this?\n\nThere's another matter I'd like to inquire about. I knew nothing about having to dispense medicine, until upon arrival here. Have done it since Sept.; it really gives you no free time at all. It seems to me a person should receive some remuneration for this, also have to give out mail when it's brought in.\nThere is a woman here, whom I understand, has served as nurse for the entire village for many years; in fact, she's nurse and Doctor. I understand she's very competent. Imagine Dr. Mac Donald of Fort Simpson could give you more information about her than I can. She prescribes all medicines, why could not she dispense them also & receive some remuneration for same as well as for her nursing? Of course, she knows nothing of this suggestion, but it does seem a sensible thing to done to do, hence this suggestion.\n\nSincerely,\n\nIngs B. Tedlock\nHartley Bay B.C.\nvia Butedale\nOttawa, Ontario,\nJanuary 21, 1943.\n\nEXD.\n\nHerewith is a copy of a letter from Inez Tedlock, Hartley Bay, B.C.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would give this your consideration and recommend what arrangements should be made. I believe that only a dispenser is necessary and whether it is Mrs. Telford or the lady mentioned in Mrs. Telford's letter, will be left to your judgment. She could be paid on a monthly voucher basis.\n\nW.L. Falconer, M.D.,\nAsst. Director, Indian Health Services.\n\nDr. P.S.

Reference your letter file 168-28-1 dated 21-January-48. Mr. Anfield, Indian Agent, Prince Rupert was requested to supply information concerning services rendered by the school teacher Mrs. Inez Tedlock.\n\n2. Janitor services are provided by the school and are not a charge against our Department. Mr. Anfield recommends that $15.00 per month be paid to Mrs. Tedlock for her services as dispenser. She serves a band of 150 Indians at Hartley Bay, but in view of the fact that dispensers are paid in all the other reserves in the Skeena Agency, we will have to recognize the services of Mrs. Tedlock. Mr. Anfield's recommendation that she be paid $15.00 per month is approved.\n\nP.S. Tennant\n\nP.S.

Accompanying the voucher should be a report signed by Mrs. Tedlock giving a detailed account of the services rendered, such as drugs dispensed, dressings done and home visits, and on the bottom of this report she should state \"my charge for this service is $15.00.\" She should then forward this report in triplicate to the Agent who will forward it to you with a covering voucher.\n\nW.L.

Mrs. Tedlock was in a highly nervous condition and I advised her to stay in town for a rest.\n\nToday I had a long conversation with Mr. and Mrs. Tedlock about conditions at Hartley Bay School. They felt that since Christmas the attitude of the people has changed towards them and that they no longer have the scholastic interests of their children at heart.\n\nI believe these people would profit by a few more days rest and I have authorized them to remain in Prince Rupert until Friday of this week when I shall take them back to Hartley Bay and have a meeting with the Council about school conditions. I shall ask Mrs. Tedlock to see a Doctor whilst she is in town as a certificate of disability may be required to cover this absence.\n\nF.

The certificate of disability referred to by the Agent will be forwarded when received and a recommendation will be made at that time.\n\n[Signature]\nfor W.S.

We are namely stationed at the Hartley Bay, B.C. Indian Reserve since Oct. 1948. During the year 1947-1948 we were at the Moose Woods Sioux Indian Reserve (Whitecap Indian Day School) Saskatchewan.\n\nFor this 1948-1949 school year we have received the following checks so far:\n\n| Date       | Net Earning |\n|------------|-------------|\n| Oct.30,1948 | $167.60     |\n| Nov.30,1948 | $84.60      |\n| Dec.15,1948 | $83.00      |\n| Dec.31,1948 | $84.60      |\n| Jan.15,1949 | $83.00      |\n| Jan.31,1949 | $84.60      |\n\nWhat appears to be wrong is (1) the interim check ($2.00) is addressed to the Bank we do our business with, namely the Royal Bank of Canada at Langley Prairie, B.C. The Bank forwards these checks to us for endorsements before they receive them for deposit. (2) The stubs of the checks seem to be detached and come separately to us, usually first addressed to our former address at Moose Woods Reserve, in Saskatchewan, from where they are forwarded to us here at Hartley Bay. (3) You will notice that we miss one check, the interim check for November 1948. We have not received the check nor the stub for the same. Either it got lost in the mail which is quite likely under the circumstances, or else an error occurred at the Office of the Treasury in Ottawa where the checks are issued. Now what we would like to suggest for the future is:\n\n(1) Send all checks to us directly at Hartley Bay.\n(2) Check the error in addressing the stubs instead of the old address directly to Hartly Bay.\n(3) Check the error of the missing interim check for the month of November 1948.\n\nWe wish to thank you kindly for your trouble in anticipation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I was exceedingly glad of their suggestion and told them to see you about the matter. But, Dear Mr. Morrow, in case they do not see you, I shall count it a great favour if you will write to them at your earliest convenience about this matter, and direct them what course to take. Dear Mr. Morrow, not known my feelings toward the Indians is like your own. I simply wish to do the good, and that is why I have lived amongst them for the past eighteen years. I am a land swabber. I feel sure that I and my family with the whole of the Indian have your sympathy, and that you will do your best to get us a set of house built, which we all agree is greatly needed.\n\nI believe Mr. Whitington is going to speak to you on this subject when he comes north again.\n\nNot wishing to weary you, I will draw this to a close. Hoping to see you in the near future, if so we could talk over matters far better than write about them. Wishing you and yours very blessing. Mrs. H. united with best wishes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sig) Geo. Reade\n\nHartley Bay,\nB.C.\nTo Mr. Geo.W.Horrow\n\nMetlakatla, B.C.\n\nDear Friend:\n\nI am writing this note to you by way of explanation. The people here as a whole want a proper school house built. I am sure that my heart is with them in this matter, seeing that I have been using a portion of my dwelling house for school purposes for the past nine years. Yes, and I went down very liberally on my own hands and knees with scrubbing brush etc., in order to keep the place neat. Dear friend, when you came here you saw the room I was using for school purposes, and I am sure you did agree with me when I say the place is not large enough to school 15 children in, and there is no dorms, but yet there will be an increase of four or five more this coming autumn. We have no room for writing desks.\n\nDear Friend, you know just how much land the people of this place have set aside for Mission Property, I think it is about 40 acres. St. and you know just how the buildings stand now on that land. It would not really be safe in case of fire to employ another good building inside such a small space. The people promised when you were here with Mr. Whittington that if ever the time came to erect a school house here, they would set a small piece of land aside for that purpose, in addition to what they had already set aside for the Mission Property. And now we all are in favour of erecting a school house, I asked them providing our Government and the Methodist Church together would find the material to build a proper school house here at Metlakatla Bay, seeing that you say you are too poor to do it. And yet you say you would like very much to have one built. Would you give a piece of land for that purpose as you promised to do? They are inclined to say they never promised the land. Dear Mr. Horrow, of course I would not argue the matter with them.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As Hartley Bay is an isolated locality, few steamers calling there except on special occasions at long intervals apart, and as the hand has had, or indeed, asked, but little of the Department I would recommend the request of their teacher and missionary to the most favorable consideration of the Department. As the Arent suggests, I would ask that a plan and specification be drawn up by the Department suited to the requirements of a building for the use of the Indians, as has been done for other localities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B.C.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Vowell Esqre.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nPlease accept my heartiest thanks for your esteemed favor which came to hand today. It was exceedingly kind of you, Sir, to take all the trouble you did, & I only hope I may have the privilege some day of more practically expressing my great appreciation to you.\n\nI am very sorry for the irregularity I made in forwarding direct to you the School Returns & Requisition for school Material. But it was only after having written the Indian Agent several times in vain that I made up my mind to write to you. For we have had a report Mr. Morrow has given up the Indian work, & I am inclined to believe it as he was always so prompt in replying to me. But I have been writing for over six weeks or two months & have received no reply as yet.\n\nOur trouble is this, Sir, & it is no small one. We want most urgently a school house. Right up to the present the school has been held in the Indian room of the Mission. This room measures only 13x15. Last quarter our average was 14.55 and the one before this 21.21. For nearly 3 weeks we had from 23 - 27 children for from 4 to 5 hours every day (but Saturday) & this in itself contributes a certainly strong reason why we should have a school-house.\n\nAnd then again our house is so dreadfully damp unless some change is made I shall lose both wife & children with consumption. Quite recently when we were retiring looking under the bed we saw some drops of water hanging from the mattress and spring. And this evidently had been the case for weeks. The result, as you may imagine, is my wife has contracted a cold that is not easily yielding to treatment.\n\nI\nI may say a school house has been already faithfully promised both by Dr. Whittington & Mr. Morrow. It was to be built this year. But owing to the retirement of Mr. Morrow\u2014which we all most sincerely regret\u2014and the impending retirement of the Rev. Dr. Whittington from the management of our Indian District, our work is most certainly suffering.\n\nI intend to try the Agent again & see if he is at home. But if I am not worrying you too much I would be grateful to you if you could put in a word for us. We have had an exceptionally good two quarters here. I find improvement all along the line. The children are on the whole attentive, industrious & apt pupils. And their parents encourage us in every way. All we want is a good substantial school-house and furnishings. Granted this we can go on and prosper and will promise to be hereafter self-supporting so far school requisites are concerned.\n\nI am asking for a $600. building, & $100. furnishings including school materials. Our village in the near future will be an important centre as the prospects of a railway coming & the opening of a new Saw-mill has attracted several new families.\n\nI had several other matters I wished to bring before you but perhaps you would grant me an interview when I come down next week.\n\nAs I have but recently come out from England I am not very familiar with the right order of procedure in all these matters under your care. But if you can help us forward & secure us a hearing from the right source I will be ever grateful to you.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n\"H.W.W.

The better plan would appear to be for you either to let the contract to some reliable man who will do the work within the sum specified, viz., $1000.00, or else to have it done by day labour, as is proposed at the Bella Coola school. In either case the Department will expect you to see that the workmanship is satisfactory and the building completed in a creditable manner.\n\nShould day labour be adopted the men should be required to work the usual number of hours according to the custom of the locality.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nOttawa, July 7, 1910.\n\nWith cheque,\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 2nd instant authorizing you to proceed with the erection of the Bella Coola school building by day labour I beg to enclose here-with an accountable cheque for $200.00 as an advance with which to purchase material and pay for labour. Upon receipt of vouchers showing an expenditure of the whole or a portion of this a further advance will be sent, if requested.\n\nShould the Hartley Bay school be erected by day labour and you so advise the Department a cheque for a similar purpose will be sent you, but the accounts for the two schools must be kept separate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nBella Coola, B.C.\nAug. 4th, 1910.\n\nSir:\n\nI shall also try to get the school-houses at Hartley Bay and Kitkatla built as soon as possible; and by day labor if I can get men I can trust. At both of these places, both the material and the men will have to be sent in; this will take some time as these reserves are outside of the regular steam-boat route.\n\nI may be able to get men from here to go to Hartley Bay; men that I know personally.\n\nI am, Sir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) Iver Fouquer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

Secretary.\n\nIver Bouquet, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nSir:-\n\nAs to the Hartley Bay school I regret to say that I think it will have to be left till spring. The carpenter I depended on is not yet ready to go; it is getting late in the season and I do not like to bear the responsibility of building a school house with day labor, when days are short, and the weather rainy. I shall make full explanations to the missionary and the Indians at the place.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(agg) Iver Founger,\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nSec., Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 1, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that it is regretted very much that you have not been able to proceed with the work on the school building at Hartley Bay.\n\nThe money for this purpose was provided this year and the Department would rather not have to ask for a renewal of the vote, so that, if you find it at all practicable, you should endeavour to have the work done this fall. However, if this is not possible, you might be able to purchase the materials before the end of the current fiscal year, March 31st, next, which would leave only the labour to be paid for out of next year's vote. Be good enough to state whether arrangements could be made to store the lumber and other supplies if purchased now.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nIver Pounger, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of Ist. inst. No.260470 I have the honor to state that I wrote to the missionary and teacher at Hartley Bay asking him if he had a safe place in which to store the material, and am awaiting his reply.\n\nIf the schoolhouse is to be built before March 31st, it must be done by Indians living at the place. The plan I like to follow is to get one or two skilled white carpenters with Indian helpers; the work will then be well done and an object lesson to the Indians. With short days and rainy weather expensive and unsatisfactory work will be the rule. The specifications call for a concrete chimney which I doubt the Indians are able to build.\n\nI very much regret the delay but I have used my best endeavor and judgment.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

These, I believe, should be provided before the opening of the new school year in September.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report as follows for the month of July\n\nDuring this trip, the locations of Indian traplines on Gill and Campania Islands were ascertained. We tied up for the night at Surf Inlet, and on the following day proceeded to Hartley Bay which was reached in the evening.\n\nNext morning I went ashore and met Mr. J.A. Findlay, teacher of the day School who, with Mrs. Findlay, is spending the summer vacation at the village. Like other villages we visited, I found nearly all the Indians away at the canneries.\n\nAn inspection was made of the school building and some needed repairs were noted. Mr. Findlay asked to have the interior of the school room painted before school opened. While no provision was made for this expenditure in the present estimates, the expense would be so small that I am in favor of having it done. This matter will be taken up separately and the Department informed of the probable cost.\n\nMr. Findlay is a very capable teacher and takes an active interest in the welfare of the people in his charge. I found the village clean and tidy. Two new houses have been put up in the village since my previous visit.\n\nW.E.

Payment of the account is recommended.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nW.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nVancouver B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6392, File 813-5, part 2)\nExtract from Commissioner Mackay's letter dated October 5:\n\nI would like to draw your attention to the suggestion made by Inspector Barry, which is to the effect that further accommodation is badly wanted here, and he suggests that it would be economical to use the lumber which was intended for sidewalks on this Reserve to construct this further accommodation. At the moment it would certainly appear as though the Indians will not use this lumber for the purpose originally intended on the belief that it is not suitable, and that some mistake was made in the original order. If this is so, it would certainly be a good thing to use it in erection of an addition to the School, and the renewal of the Village street remain for another year.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the Hartley Bay School dated September 29:\n\nWith regard to the erection of a new school at this point mentioned in my last report, which I wish to refer to at this time, I may say that there are some twelve thousand board feet of 2 in. by 6 in. double dressed fir lumber in lengths of 8 ft., 9 ft. and 12 ft., intended for a village street but quite unsuitable for this purpose, now not being used and lying under a house at Hartley Bay.\n\nAn addition to the present schoolroom is badly needed, and this could be so constructed at the back of the present schoolroom and making an L. with it to accommodate the children for whom the present room is too small and give space underneath for a small manual training shop. An addition of some 15 ft. by 20 ft. could easily be constructed from the above mentioned lumber and certain extra material in the way of shingles, 7,000 and material for covering the inside walls. This extra material and the labour of Indians for the erection of the addition would not cost in excess of \u00a3350.00 probably about half this sum. Twenty four feet of blackboard four feet wide would also be needed and a few windows. If the whole school and addition were then painted outside and kalsomined inside there would be no need for a new school here for a number of years.\n\nWith special reference to Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Page 3 of my last report on the Hartley Bay Indian Day School, dated May 5th 1938, I would ask that authority be given to the Indian Agent to make use of the above mentioned lumber in the way described, and that a sum of not more than $300.00 be approved for the extra material needed and the Indian labour involved in the erection of the addition, the work to be under the immediate direction of the teacher, Mr. Findlay and the general supervision of the Indian Agent.\n\n(Sgd.) Gerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOttawa,\nMarch 21, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following is an extract from Indian Agent Collison's report for the month of February and refers to the Hartley Bay school:\n\n\"The proposed extension to the school building has not been carried out, both the teacher and Indians being of the opinion that the use of heavy lumber originally intended for road repairs being entirely unsuited for the purpose. Personally I quite agree with this opinion, and would again suggest that this lumber be used in replacing the school plank walk which at present is in a state of disrepair.\n\n\"As the school is overcrowded when the Indians are all at home, I would recommend that the appropriation of $250.00 already authorized be increased to cover the cost of carrying out the extension with proper lumber. The people are urging the erection of a new school, and that the present building be used for manual training and domestic science purposes.\n\n\"The discipline in this school is splendid, and the teacher, Mr. Findlay, deserves every credit.\"\n\nWhen I was at the Coast last year I recall hearing considerable discussion regarding the lumber supplied at Hartley Bay. If my memory serves me correctly I was told that the lumber was not suitable for sidewalks but would be useful for building purposes. My impressions in this regard were confirmed in Inspector Barry's report on the Hartley Bay school dated September 29, 1938, in which he recommended\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nthat the lumber supplied for sidewalks be used for an addition to the school. It now appears from Agent Collison's letter that the lumber is not suitable for the school but could be used for the plank walk leading to the school. I realize that you had nothing to do with the purchase of the lumber but I think you will agree that when such conflicting reports reach the Department from our officers in the field it is almost impossible for us to make a decision.\n\nYou will remember that in my letter of December 1, 1938, I wrote to you with reference to the proposed addition to the Hartley Bay school. Apparently you communicated with Mr. Collison and the information contained in his report is no doubt a sequel to your letter to him.\n\nI now note that the Indians are requesting a new school at this point. If you consider that a new school should be erected I should appreciate your arranging for the completion of the enclosed data form. While I am not in a position to state definitely I am hopeful that if you recommend a new building at Hartley Bay it will be possible to secure funds for the purpose in the supplementary estimates. I know you must be very busy but I should appreciate having your reply together with the completed data form at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nReport for February 1939.\n\nHartley Bay\n\nThe proposed extension to the school building has not been carried out, both the teacher and Indians being of the opinion that the use of heavy lumber originally intended for road repairs being entirely unsuited for the purpose.

The stringers and piles are reported as in shape shape. This lumber was paid for from the Indian Education appropriation.\n\nI would recommend approval of the application as it is probable that the remaining 10,000 f.b.m. may be more than sufficient for the purposes of sidewalks, etc., for the new School, if and when erected.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 29, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 19th instant with reference to the proposed erection of a new day school at Hartley Bay.\n\nI note that the Indians are prepared to give a site but that it will require $500.00 to clear and drain it. I understand from your letter that no matter what site is chosen clearing and draining will be required.\n\nIn preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1940-41 an amount of $5000.00 was provided for the erection of a school at Hartley Bay but due to the recent dissolution of Parliament it is not likely that our estimates will receive consideration for some months. Consequently I am not at present in a position to state definitely whether or not the amount mentioned above will be eventually secured for the erection of this building. Under these circumstances it is not possible to give any authority at the present time for draining and clearing the site mentioned in your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training\nDear Sir:\n\nAn item having been included in the 1940-41 estimates submitted to the Department for a new school at Hartley Bay, Skeena River Agency, the Agent was instructed to have the Council consider setting aside a sufficient area of the Reserve for school purposes. In this connection the Council met on December 14th, last, and passed the attached resolution in which the area set aside is described.\n\nFrom the sketch and description enclosed, it would appear that the site selected is on slightly elevated ground a short distance west and north of the present school. It is covered with surface muskeg and was partly cleared of heavy timber some years ago in preparation for use as a village playground.\n\nAs pointed out in Mr. Indian Agent Gillett's letter accompanying the resolution, the area will require extensive drainage which is true of all the land adjacent to the village. The Agent estimates the cost of clearing and draining the area in preparation for the construction of the school at $500.00. I would therefore recommend that if it is intended to proceed this coming fiscal year with the construction of a new school at this point that provision in the amount of $500.00 be included to take care of this item.\n\nInspector Barry suggests that the area set aside by the Council be increased to one acre and that a proper survey be made. I doubt if the Council would object to this as there is plenty land available. A full acre could be set aside and the portion in excess of what could be cleared and drained for the sum mentioned, improved in course of time.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nNo doubt the Department will advise in due course whether or not it is intended to provide funds for the Hartley Bay School from the 1940-41 Vote.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Site for new school, Hartley Bay\n\nI enclose herewith in triplicate, a resolution unanimously passed by the Kitkata band of Indians, setting aside a portion of land on the Kulkayu I.R.No.4, for the proposed new Indian day school.\n\nThis is the site selected by Capt. Barry and Mr. Collison. It is covered with muskeg which is from four to six feet deep, and very wet.\n\nIt will be necessary to have it ditched on four sides and it may require one or two covered drains through the centre. The east ditch will have to be extended to the river to give the water a natural outlet. It will cost at least $500.00 to carry out approximately 1000 feet of ditching, clearing and draining.\n\nI recommend that this work be done by the Indians before the fishing season, if funds are available.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.

This matter has been the subject of a special report made to the Indian Commissioner at Vancouver.\n\nW.E. Collison,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Your File 168-28-5.\n\nI have to refer to Mr. Hoey's letter of March 21st in which the lumber supplied in the spring of 1938 for the village roadway and the proposed new school at Hartley Bay are dealt with. Perhaps I should add here that instructions were issued to Mr. Collison on December 7th, based on the information and authority contained in your letter of December 1st.\n\nThe first lot of lumber supplied was quite unsuitable for the purpose for which it was intended. No doubt it could be used to some extent in connection with the construction of either a new addition to the present school or the proposed new school. The lumber is double dressed fir 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch x 6 inch in lengths of 6, 9 and 18 ft.; the quality is not above fair. It probably would in some respects be hard to work lumber of this thickness and width into a new construction, and I am inclined to agree that it could be used to very good advantage in replacing the school sidewalks which now are very much in need of attention.\n\nIt undoubtedly would be much better to build a new school at Hartley Bay than add to the present building, which was erected in 1913 and is in need of alteration and repair. I do not consider, however, that definite arrangements for the construction of a new school at this point should be made until a suitable site has been decided upon and handed over to the Department for school purposes. My opinion is that we should have a separate parcel of ground for this school apart entirely from Church property. I should suggest that a school along the lines of the Bella Coola Indian Day School would very well suit the requirements of the Indian children of Hartley Bay.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYou ...\nYou are doubtless aware that Mr. Indian Agent Collison will reach retirement age on June 12th of this year and as he has been a long time in the service, a successor would not be appointed until the close of the year. Moreover, Mr. Collison has also the Gitlakdamix School construction arrangements to attend to. Under these circumstances I should advise the postponement of the erection of a new school at Hartley Bay until late this fall, or early in the 1940-41 fiscal year. In the meantime, I shall communicate with Mr. Collison regarding a suitable site for the new school and an estimate of the cost of clearing the site. A definite recommendation with respect to the disposal of the lumber on hand could then be made.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M.

This site should be decided on and handed over to the Department and the necessary arrangements made to clear and prepare same before construction is undertaken.\n\nINFORMATION SUBMITTED BY:\n\nDATE:\nMarch 29, 1939.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O.Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nAs requested I have read Departmental letter 168-28-5 of March 21st with reference to a proposed new school at Hartley Bay, Skeena River Agency.\n\nMr Hoey is quite correct in his memory of the lumber at Hartley Bay, which was not suitable for the main roadway through the village, but which could be used for an addition to the Indian Day School if the addition was constructed in a rather unusual manner. I regret that I never was able to convey to Mr Indian Agent Collison the plan I had in mind, though Mr Indian Agent Gillett was very certain that we could build an addition with the available lumber. Mr Gillett had been with me at Hartley Bay on our way to Prince Rupert.\n\nThe Indians at Hartley Bay are anxious to have a modern school. The present teacher has been a great success. There is no proper place for the elementary Manual Training carried on at this school. The school is overcrowded. For all the above reasons I believe that I might reasonably request that a new school be erected when funds are available. The Indians are members of the United Church and it is under the auspices of that Church that the school is conducted.\n\nTo assist you I am suggesting some replies to Mr Hoey's questions:\n\nName of Building: Hartley Bay Indian Day School.\nLocation: Hartley Bay near junction of Greenville and Douglas Channels, some 90 miles S.E. of Prince Rupert, B.C.\nRecommend Construction: By Indian labour under a \"White\" foreman. The Indians are intelligent and have erected quite good houses for themselves. They however leave the village for fishing in the summer, June to September inclusive.\nBuilding Requirements: Rooms and Accommodation: Number of Pupils:\nType of Construction: Large classroom to accommodate forty children\n\nThe average attendance varies much during the year that during the past three years being tabulated below:\n\n| School Year | 1937-38 | 1938-39 | 1939-40 |\n|-------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| September Quarter | 27.0    | 15.0    | 12.0    |\n| December Quarter   | 28.5    | 26.5    | 25.0    |\n| March Quarter      | 28.5    | 27.1    | 32.9    |\n| June Quarter       | 20.5    | 27.2    | 19.4    |\n\nIt may I think be assumed that the average attendance is some 75% of the total number on the school roll, in the village at the time. Accommodation should therefore be provided for the maximum easily taught by one teacher, up to 40.\n\nCement basement of sufficient size and height to permit of installation of hot air furnace and small Manual Training room, and leave room for several cords of wood fuel. Manual Training and Domestic Science could be taught in the present building for a time, but if a school is to be erected it would be better to make provision in the new building for the Manual Training and also a small room for Domestic Science. No living accommodation will be needed for the teacher who is United Church Missionary and lives in the Mission House.\nSimilar type of construction to school lately erected at Pemberton would be very satisfactory.\n\nDescription of Site Etc.\n\nSchool should be located on site taken from Indian Reserve and not on United Church property. Present school is to rear of and to one side of the new United Church building.\n\nSome clearing may have to be undertaken and surface drains placed to carry water away from around basement. Present school is within about 150 yards of sea. Village has only wooden roads and walks. I believe that the rock is very near the surface and that any large excavation is out of the question. The cement basement suggested would have to be constructed as in many of the Provincial Day Schools above the ground level. Outside toilets would be satisfactory as at present.\n\nWater Supply Etc.\n\nI have no information on file. Water is I believe brought in pipes from a short distance to the rear of the village. In any case water would not have to be brought into the proposed school, at least at present.\n\nToilet Facilities:\n\nOutside toilets with excavated pits.\n\nHeating System Type of Furnace: Fuel.\n\nHot air furnace with pipes to two outlets in classroom and to other rooms if any provided. Fuel would be wood I believe.\n\nLighting System:\n\nBy gas lamps.\n\nBuilt-in Equipment Etc.\n\nTwo large cupboards with shelves to take sundries and books. Windows should be on one side only leaving all opposite wall and one end for asbestos slate blackboard opposite end for doors and cupboards. Windows should be on left side as children enter doors. Boards should be 4 feet wide and run whole length of side and end mentioned above.\n\nShipping Instructions for Materials Etc.\n\nHartley Bay is a port of call of Union Steam Ships from Vancouver. No wharf available. Materials would either have to be landed from Union S. Ship by Indian boats, or better brought from Prince Rupert by scow and towed to beach on high tide.\n\nRemarks:\n\nI consider that the Indian Agent should select a good site for the new school quite apart from any consideration of the present location of old school which was erected by the Department in 1913, and is not in particularly good repair.\n\nI trust that the above information may be of some assistance but suggest that Mr. Indian Agent Collison be asked for more detailed particulars before the plans are drawn. May I suggest that he be supplied with a copy of this letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H.

In November the attendance reached 46 and there are 3 pupils still to come in from the Canneries. There were 3 children attending under seven years of age and the teacher was asked to exclude them. The Council was also notified of the request.\n\nThe school is 18 x 24 feet and 10 feet high. It is very old and delapidated. Walls are dark brown and ceilings a dirty buff. Lighting conditions are bad and the children's eyesight is in grave danger. Boards are black hyloplate and badly worn.\n\nThe Council have agreed to cut away overgrowth of brush and small trees around the school to improve light. This is to be done free.\n\nIt is recommended that during the Xmas vacation the school interior should be painted two coats flat tone, ceilings ivory and walls cream - trim green. Walls are 840 sq. feet and will require 3 gallons cream paint @ $6.90 per gallon. Ceiling is 132 sq. feet and will require 2 gallons paint @ $6.90 per gallon. Trim 2 quarts @ $6.90 (green) per gallon; 6 bottles \"Soil Off\" for washing prior to painting, 3 brushes @ $2.50. 1 quart of turps will cost $3.00 and 1 quart of green blackboard paint $3.25. Total cost of materials amount to $56.90, which total includes $5.00 for Soil Off. Labour - 6 days for 3 men @ $5.40 per day = $97.20\n\nTotal cost of Material - $56.70\nTotal cost of Labour $27.20\nTotal cost $153.90.\n\nThe work is urgently needed and is recommended for immediate attention. Materials can be bought in Prince Rupert.\nOttawa, November 29th, 1947.\n\nMr. H.

MMcN\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Education Division.\nRe: Hartley Bay Indian Day School\n\nAs the Department is aware, the estimated enrolment at the above mentioned school for the 1949-50 academic year will be over 50 and although the Department is preparing to advertise for the construction of a new school at this point it is obvious that the new building will not be ready until 1950-51 academic year. It is therefore recommended that the items requested by Mr. Superintendent Anfield in his attached letter and requisition be supplied. I have written to Mr. Anfield requesting an estimate of the amount required to put the Council Hall in condition for temporary use. Mr. Inspector Davey is familiar with this building and believes that it can reasonably be prepared for school use on a temporary basis.\n\nW.B. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nThe Chief and Council have given the Department the use of the hall on the waterfront as a second classroom. I discussed this with Johnny Clifton today and he expresses on behalf of the Band their satisfaction that the present overcrowding in the school may end this fall. The floor of the hall is in good shape but repairs to the roof will be required and also windows and some work on the end of the hall.\n\nI attach requisitions for primary tables, chairs, blackboards, and teacher's desk and a large oil heater. All this equipment can be moved to the new school when built, so it would appear in order to purchase it at once. In a few days, I shall submit a requisition for needed repairs to the building. I shall send the Naskeena down to Hartley Bay next week to survey the exact needs. I know the hall, however, and am satisfied it can be fixed without undue cost and made to fill a very needed purpose.\n\nWill you please consider that we shall need 2 teachers at Hartley Bay this fall. I will guarantee that the building will be ready for use if the funds are made available.\n\nF.

This material was put off at Butealld\nand arrangements were made with Mr. Malcolm of Canadian Fish,\nwho very kindly offered to send this equipment gratis to\nHartley Bay. He sent a full load with one of his big packers\nonly to find at Hartley Bay that a south east gale was blowing\nand there being nobody in the village, was impossible to unload\nand effect a landing. As you know, there is no wharf or float at\nthis point. As the boat was urgently required for fishing oper-\nations, the skipper took the load to Rupert where we put it in\nstorage. The Captain was unable to wait and it has been necessary\nto charter a boat to take this load to Hartley Bay.\n\nThe job took two days and the cost for the bare expenses\nof fuel and oil and the wages of the three men concerned, it\nis regretted that this extra expense should be necessary but\nthere was no other way of getting supplies to Hartley Bay except\nby steamer. The first visit of the steamer on the new schedule\nwill not be until October. It was imperative to get this equip-\nment and this lumber and material to Hartley Bay to get the\nnew classroom into operation by the time the teachers arrived.\n\nPayment of the account has been rendered for recommendation.\n\nSgd.

D. P. Heaney\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources.\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nHartley Bay, Kincolith and Lakalsap Indian Day Schools.\n\nIncluded in our Main Estimates for 1949-50 is the sum of $30,000.00 each for the erection of two-room schools and teacherages on each of the above reserves, in the Skeena River Agency, near Prince Rupert, British Columbia.\n\nWhereas our day school building program has met with considerable success in the other provinces, we have encountered many difficulties in British Columbia. At Ucluelet, we advertised for tenders for the erection of a two-room school and attached teachers' residence and the lowest tender for standard construction was $42,612.00. This same school, we are having built in Saskatchewan for $29,000.00. As you are aware, we finally decided to erect a Quonset school at Ucluelet.\n\nAt Cape Mudge, we advertised for a one-room school with attached teacher's residence complete with electricity, plumbing, etc. We are having two such schools erected in Ontario for about $17,000.00. The one and only tender received for the erection of the Cape Mudge School was $29,744.75.\n\nAt Fort Babine, we advertised for tenders for the erection of a two-room Indian day school and teacherage but received one tender only, in the amount of $67,391.00.\n\nTherefore, due to the scarcity of contractors bidding on our projects and the high prices tendered by them, our officials in British Columbia have come to the decision that prefabricated\nschools should be erected on each of the above three reserves. Their decision in this regard has been aided by the satisfaction obtained from the company which erected the two-room school and teacherage at Pemberton Meadows in the New Westminster Agency and the one-room school at Metlakatla in the Skeena River Agency. This company is Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 489, Vancouver, B. C., and I attach both the previous Order-in-Council covering the provision of the Pemberton Meadows School and photographs taken by Inspector Davey of the completed building.\n\nOur officials are perfectly satisfied with these buildings and Mr. Indian Superintendent Anfield, who knows how to supervise the erection of this type of school from his experience at Metlakatla, makes the following statement:\n\n\"I am satisfied that it will wear well, operate economically and that the type of construction is suitable and most adaptable for the type of country in the Skeena Agency. The school has been viewed with considerable approval by the Provincial School Inspector, Mr. J. Shell, at Prince Rupert. It is recommended that two-classroom schools of this type, with teacherages attached, be constructed at Hartley Bay, Greenville and Kincolith, with the least possible delay.\"\n\nWith regard to advertising for tenders, not only have we our previous disappointments as a guide, but Mr. Anfield makes the following statement:\n\n\"I have approached Messrs. Mitchell and Currie, Greer and Bridden, both contracting firms of Prince Rupert and they refuse to bid on the construction of new schools at these three points, giving isolation of location and risk re transportation as the main reasons. These and other contractors in Prince Rupert have so much other work on hand that they are just not interested.\"\n\nMr. Indian Commissioner Arnell concurs in these recommendations and points out that these buildings can be erected at a cost to the Department considerably less than we could get a quotation from a contractor. In this regard he makes the following statement:\n\"You will note Mr. Anfield's reference to the need for employment at these Indian villages. Erection of these schools will provide some of that much-needed employment and in addition will ensure most urgently required classroom accommodation and, as previously pointed out, at a saving of several thousand dollars in each case.\"\n\nThe only other company in British Columbia producing schools of this type is Precision Housing Company, which produces pre-cut schools. These are much more difficult to erect with the type of semi-skilled Indian labour we will have available and are not recommended by our field officials.\n\nTherefore, I have no hesitation in recommending to you for presentation to the Minister, the attached Submission to Council covering the purchase of three prefabricated schools from Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 489, Vancouver, B.C., for erection on these three reserves in the Skeena River Agency. We have foremen-carpenters in mind and can employ the Indians who are fairly competent mechanics and carpenters, under white supervision, for the erection of these prefabricated buildings.\n\nDirector.\n\nEnclosure\n\nRecommendation forwarded to Council Nov. 10/49.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 15 NOVEMBER 1949\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources and pursuant to the provisions of Section 36 of the Public Works Act, advise that authority be granted to enter into a contract with Prefabricated Structures, Limited, Post Office Box 489, Vancouver, British Columbia, for the provision of a two-room Indian day school with attached teachers' residence at each of the Hartley Bay, Kincolith and Lakalsap Indian Reserves, in the Skeena River Indian Superintendency, British Columbia, on the basis of $9,750.00 f. o. b.

Unfortunately, I believe the price varies slightly from that mentioned in your letter, being in the amount of $9,750.00 each. I presume that you can make a local adjustment with the company covering this extra payment.\n\nI would also ask that Mr. Anfield advise as soon as possible the name of the foreman-carpenter of each project and also the specific sum needed for an accountable advance.\n\nWith three schools being provided, I wondered whether the company might consider sending in an erection supervisor. Therefore, in the Order-in-Council I included authority for freight and the erection supervisor's wages, fare and expenses. You might discuss this with the company as a man of this kind could save us considerable money in advising the foremen-carpenters as to how to proceed with this work.\n\nPlease emphasize to Mr. Anfield the need for intelligent anticipation on these projects so that we will not be receiving hurried telegrams from him concerning extra funds required, etc.\n\nBernard M.

The third building is ready for shipment from Vancouver.\n\nThere is some doubt as to whether or not we will be able to get to Greenville before the end of the fiscal year. You will be advised when work on these projects is resumed.\n\n(sgd) W.S.

The second school shipped would have gone into Greenville had river conditions ameliorated.

Wiring between school and power house to be No. 6 Weatherproof wire.\n\nWiring of the classrooms and teacherage in 2/14 loomex non-metallic sheathed cable.\n\nProvide and install Warden V-717 semi indirect ceiling fixtures for the classrooms. All wiring to be in accordance with the B.C. Electrical Code, and all materials and fixtures C.E.S.A. approved.\n\nAn additional $50.00 to be charged for the installation and hook-up of the 5kw plant provided by the department. Board and room for electricians to be provided by the department, plus $2.00 per hour per man while travelling to and from the site.\n\nHaving already complete roughing-in of the wiring at Kincolith, and thus obtaining a more accurate estimate of our costs of labour and material, we find it necessary to increase our estimate for these schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRupert Radio & Electric\n\nF. Parlott.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nApril 17, 1950.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nAttached please find bid from Rupert Radio & Electric,\non the electrical work proposed to be undertaken at the Hartley\nBay Indian Day School this Agency.\n\nIt is noted that this firm, which is doing the\nKincolith job, has raised their price. I contacted the Manager and\nasked him why. He informed me that having roughed in Kincolith\ncompletely ready for fixtures, he has found that he is close to the\nnon-profit line on the job and must raise his price on the other\ntwo installations.\n\nFor your information and in accordance with your\nArmy Signal of April 16, we wrote to the Northern B.C. Power Co.\nand they have this morning informed me through the manager, Mr.\nT.B. Black, that they are not going to bid on the work as they\ncannot take out of town jobs.\n\nThe Parkin Electric Co. referred to in your Army\nSignal is out of business.\n\nRupert Radio & Electric have done a dandy job at\nKincolith and if the bid is still low, it is recommended that they\nbe given the contract for the two remaining schools without delay\nas roughing in of Hartley Bay in particular must be in hand within\n10 days.\n\nWould you therefore endeavour, if at all possible,\nto expedite finalisation of these wiring contracts by Army Signal\nto Ottawa.\n\nF. Earl Anfield\nIndian Superintendent\n\nfeaym\nOttawa, April 8, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Plumbing and Heating -\n\nHartley Bay Indian Day School,\nKincolith Indian Day School,\nLakalap Indian Day School,\n\nin the Skeena River Agency.\n\nMr. Indian Commissioner Ameil has forwarded two tenders for the installation of plumbing and heating in these two-room day schools. These two tenders have been received from the following firms:\n\n1. Smith and Elkins Limited, P.O. Box 274, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n2. Baanich Plumbing and Heating Ltd., Box 1158, Prince Rupert, B.C.\n\nSmith and Elkins' bid is for $1,090.00 per school. It is presumed that the piping would be standard water piping or galvanized. It is also noted that the bid on the supplying of a well pump with motor and tank has been made but it does not indicate if this bid includes the installation.\n\nThe bid from the Baanich Plumbing and Heating works out at $1,092.63 per school which is only $2.63 more than the bid of Smith and Elkins. It is definitely preferable to employ this firm because their tender includes copper piping and joints. It is also noted that this firm will supply pressure tanks and pumps and will install these.\nOur Indian Superintendent at Prince Rupert has, therefore, recommended the acceptance of the Saanich Plumbing and Heating tender. Mr. Indian Commissioner Arnell and one of his engineers have also reviewed these tenders and have concurred in the recommendation of the acceptance of the bid from this company.\n\nI would, therefore, recommend to you the acceptance of the tender from the Saanich Plumbing and Heating Limited, of Prince Rupert, B.C., in the amount of $3,277.50 for the installation of plumbing and heating facilities in these three Indian Day Schools.\n\nDirector.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRecommended\n\nActing Deputy Minister.\n\nApproved:\n\nMinister.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, April 4, 1950.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nElectricity Installations in Indian Day Schools in the Skeena River Agency\n\nAs you are aware, we are erecting three prefabricated schools at Kincolith, Hartley Bay and Lakalsap. Originally we had hoped to complete these projects by the end of the fiscal year but unusually severe weather has prevented this.\n\nThe buildings are now ready for wiring and Mr. Arneil has called for tenders for this work. An army message was received from him reading as follows:\n\n\"Tenders for wiring Kincolith, Hartley Bay and Greenville schools have been secured and reviewed by our engineering staff. Rupert Radio & Electric submitted lowest tender $843.60 per school covering wiring to electrical code based on our engineers plan if company's tender can be accepted immediately wiring to Kincolith can be completed before March 31\".\n\nIn view of the information contained in Mr. Arneil's army message, I would recommend to you the acceptance of the lowest tender received from Rupert Radio and Electric, in the amount of $843.60 per school. Arrangements can be made for this work to be completed in early April.\n\nDirector.\n\nRecommended:\n\nDeputy Minister\n\nApproved:\n\nMinister.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Citizenship & Immigration\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRegarding voucher No. 269 and in particular the account payable to Louis J. Stewart, in the sum of $5.00 for delivering relief supplies from the Government dock at Kincolith to aged and destitute Indians at Kincolith. The Department authorized a smaller sum than this to Abel Stewart for this work. Abel Stewart is now unable to carry on the work and his son, Louis J. Stewart, has taken on the job. As there are a considerably increased number of relief recipients now resident at Kincolith, and as the price of gas has been raised twice in the past two months, it is recommended that this standing vote be increased to $5.00 per month for the next three months only at the conclusion of which period, the situation will again be reviewed.\n\nF.

(RG 10, Volume 6392, File 813-5, part 3)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Demolition of Old School Buildings, Hartley Bay, Greenville and Kincolith.\n\nIn reply to Superintendent Anfield's letter of May 5th, attached, he was requested to investigate the possibility of having Indians of the Bands concerned demolish the above-mentioned buildings on a free labour basis, in return for any materials they might salvage.\n\nYou will note from his letter of May 26th, attached, that he has been successful in making such an arrangement at Hartley Bay, but that at Kincolith and Greenville, it will cost a total of $1,000.00 to demolish the buildings and improve the sites. These old buildings are a fire hazard to the new school buildings, in addition to which, the space they occupy is required. There would appear to be no alternative but to recommend approval of the expenditure necessary. I doubt whether Mr. Anfield included the cost of demolishing these old buildings in his estimate of the costs of these new schools, and if necessary, would recommend transfer of $1,000.00 of the Appropriation for the Joint School, Port Essington, to meet the cost of the work.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.\nDemolition Old School Buildings\n\nFurther to yours of May 22, 1950 re above noted subject; conversations have taken place with the Councils and I am able to advise as follows: (1) Hartley Bay: the council agree to take possession of and remove the old School Building and rebuild it as a Council Hall. As no fire risk is involved at Hartley Bay, this is recommended and action will be taken to draw an agreement with the Council to this end. The site of the present school is required for a playground. (2) Kincolith: this is the real hazard as when the outbuildings are completed, the new school will be only six inches away from the old premises. It is recommended that $600.00 be made available immediately to demolish this building; to pile usable material and burn the rest, leaving the site clean. Men are away fishing now; it is imperative this building be taken down whilst our crew and tractor are available. (3) Greenville: there is a fire hazard here, though not so great as Kincolith, as the old building will be 20 feet away from the new. The men are away for the summer; it is recommended the building be torn down and everything burned down that is not salvageable. The good material to be piled off in a safe area for future disposition. Cost estimated at $400.00.\n\nIn the original estimate we had planned to remove all nails (which are dynamite in a furnace) and cut all waste into usable lengths for fuel. This will not be done. It was not possible to do this before, as all buildings are in use.\n\nYour instructions are requested.\n\nF. Earl Anfield,\nIndian Superintendent.\nP.O. Box 187\n\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nMay 5, 1950.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: Demolition of old buildings,\nHartley Bay, Greenville, Kincolith\n\nI have discussed with Inspector R.F. Davey, the need\nof immediate demolition of the old school buildings at the\nabove-noted villages, where new construction is presently in\nhand.\n\nAt Kincolith, the old school is less than four feet\nfrom the new building. The old structure is at least 50 years\nold and totally unfit for further use as a structure. It will\nbe and is a gross fire risk and must be removed.\n\nAt Greenville, the new building will be approximately\n20 feet from the new structure. It is 52 years old and is of no\nfurther value as a structure.\n\nAt Hartley Bay, the old school is a fairly safe\ndistance from the new school but is close to the church and\nMission House and when unused, would be a fire hazard to village\nstructures.\n\nIt is planned to demolish these three buildings and to\nsalvage any usable timber and joists for playground equipment and\nperhaps secure enough V-joint or siding for fencing around the\nnew school.\n\nThe balance of the material will be cut up for kindling\nand fuel for the new school buildings.\n\nA careful check on costs has been made and the\ndemolition, clearing up and levelling of sites, will cost as\nfollows:\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am writing him today asking that he submit a revised estimate of the cost of completing each building, which will be forwarded to you when received but in the meantime, and in order that the work will not be delayed, would ask that an accountable advance of $14,000 be forwarded to him.\n\nIf a transfer of additional funds from other projects is necessary to complete these buildings we will recommend from which projects transfer should be made.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.,\nJune 3, 1950.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nFurther to my letters to you of April 18, 1950 requesting advances on wages and freighting costs on the above noted Schools now under construction in this Agency; it is necessary to ask for additional funds as follows:\n\nKincolith --- $4,000.00\nLakalzap --- 5000.00\nHartley Bay --- 5000.00\n\nWe shall be out of funds shortly to meet payrolls which are paid up to May 20th for Kincolith and Greenville and to May 13th for Hartley Bay. Will you please request immediate action to have these funds forwarded to Agency Trust account at this end.\n\nI am afraid that in my letters to you of April 18 and 19 I underestimated these costs considerably. A check of the ledgers reveals that I omitted to take into account an overdraft of $6747.49, as of April 30, 1950.\n\nTo give an idea of the overall labour and freighting cost on these schools, the Department is advised as follows:\n\n(1) Kincolith School (Indian Bay)\nDr. Accountable advances received\n1. For swamping site $300.00\n2. For excavation site 1000.00\n3. For labour 12000.00\n4. Transfers from Hartley Bay account - Transfers from Lakalzap account 2500.00\n\nCr.

For swamping site $300.00\n2. For excavation site 1000.00\n3. For labour 18000.00\n\nRefunded Receiver Gen.

For swamping site 300.00 Refunded Receiver Gen. Acct. 1198.65\n2. For excavation on site 1000.00 Transfer to Kincolith acct. 2500.00\n3.

Earl Amfield\nIndian Superintendent\nJune 9, 1950.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\nWe have noted your recommendation with reference to the demolition of the old schools. We are extremely reluctant to authorize any expenditure for the tearing down of old buildings as in most cases we have had individual Indians or groups of Indians demolish the schools and use the lumber for the erection of their own homes. These buildings were given free to the Indians on the understanding that all lumber, etc., would be removed. The only expenditure needed is the sum for the filling in of the old foundation.\n\nTherefore, would you please refer this matter again to Mr. Anfield in the hope that a similar arrangement can be made at Kincith and Lakalsap.\n\nDepartmental approval is given for the Indian Council removing the old school building at Hartley Bay and using it as a Council hall. It is understood that there will be no expense in this connection as far as the Department is concerned.\n\nBernard F.

It is noted that the Indian Council have agreed to remove the old school building at Hartley Bay and rebuild it as a Council Hall, and that there will be no expenditure in this connection as far as the Department is concerned.\n\nWith reference to the old buildings at Kincolith and Lakalsap, it is noted that the amount of $600.00 will be required at the former school and $400.00 at the latter in order to tear the buildings down. It is presumed that Indian labour will be used, and consequently, the expenditure is approved.\n\nWe also note that you recommend transfer of an additional $1,000.00 from the appropriation for the Joint School at Port Essington, to meet the cost of the work authorized in this letter.\n\nBernard F.

However, some of the items on which this firm quotes are not included on the requisitions.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: School Construction - Skeena River Agency\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of June 16th, construction of the Lakelsap, Kincolith and Hartley Bay schools is now almost complete and definite cost figures have been made available by Mr. Anfield, reference his letter of July 3rd and statement attached.\n\nYou will note that an amount of $25,949.95 is required, additional to the $47,000 transferred from other projects since April first. Transfers as follows are recommended to make up the total required:\n\n1. Port Essington Joint School - the balance of the appropriation...........$ 4,500\n2. Gwinaha ............................................. 11,800\n3. Sunnyside............................................ 10,000\n\nTOTAL $ 26,300\n\nThis amount is somewhat more than Mr. Anfield indicates as being necessary, but as the lighting plants have not yet been provided, there will be additional expense for their installation at a later date.\n\nTransfers as listed above are recommended and I would ask that an accountable advance of $3,500 be forwarded to Mr. Anfield to pay the balance of labor costs.\n\nW.S. Arniel,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nPrince Rupert, B.C.,\nJuly 3, 1950.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nSchool Construction Costs\n\nRe yours of June 26 requesting further information monies required over and above the $47,000.00 transferred since April 1st.\n\nA detailed examination of these projects has been made and a table drawn up to show what will be required to complete the three schools by additional transfer of funds.\n\nIt would appear that the following sums will be needed:\n\n| Location     | Amount   |\n|--------------|----------|\n| Hartley Bay  | $11,281.76 |\n| Kincolith    | $6,628.26 |\n| Lakalzap     | $8,039.93 |\n\nTotal required: $25,949.95\n\nThe attached plan will give you the details as abstracted from the Voucher and Cash books of the Agency. Against the unpaid wage accounts due and estimated wage requirements, we have on June 30th in the Agency Trust account the following cash balances:\n\n| Location     | Amount   |\n|--------------|----------|\n| Hartley Bay  | $942.03  |\n| Kincolith    | $2,296.34|\n| Lakalzap     | $2,334.52|\n\nTotal: $5,572.89\n\nIt would appear we shall have enough funds for wages for Kincolith; at Hartley Bay an additional $2,000.00 will be needed; and at Lakalzap an additional $1,500.00 to complete all projects. An accountable advance of $3,500.00 is therefore requested.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Is it by weight, board measure or the length of time the goods were stored? They also raise the question of why the Voucher was not issued in favour of Prefabricated Structures, as the account attached to the Voucher is addressed to that firm and not to the Department.\n\nYou are aware, of course, that our Treasury holds the Power of Attorney which provides that all payments due Prefabricated Structures should be made to the firm mentioned on Power of Attorney.\n\nIn this connection, I direct your attention to Voucher 95 from the Skeena River Agency dated January 5th, 1950. This Voucher also covered freight charges and was approved by you.

(RG 10, Volume 6392, File 813-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nFurther to my Army Signal of today's date, attached herewith please find a statement showing the financial position of the School Construction project in this Agency as at August 12th, 1950. In spite of my best hopes, it is now found that a further appropriation of $8,138.08 will be required to complete these jobs, including the installation of lighting plants, storm doors and windows, and the conveying of school furnishings and equipment, including desks, to these schools.\n\nThe last crew came out from Kincolith last weekend, and as most of these men are moving to Ocean Falls immediately, where they will be employed, it was essential that they be paid off and that income tax deductions and unemployment insurance books be all paid up and stamped. It is to be noted that a further appropriation of $4,006.29 for Hartley Bay is included in the total amount requested, as is also a sum of $5,631.31 for Kincolith. Against these two sums there is a credit of $1,499.52 in the appropriation for Greenville. This makes a net amount of $8,138.08 required by further appropriation for Vote 516.\n\nAn accountable advance in the sum of $8,657.98 (included in the total required) is requested before the end of this month to meet the following payments:\n\nHartley Bay: 813\n\nDeficit on wage account ........................................... $306.44\nRental of equipment from Indians .................................. 150.00\nWages and boat hire for freight and hauling balance of equipment required and, installing desks, windows and lighting plant ............................................. 500.00\n\nTotal .................. $956.44\n\nThese items do not include wages for wiring in the plant or for freighting on same from Vancouver, to Prince Rupert.\nGreenville:827\n\nDeficit on wage account ........................................ $2,314.46\nRental on tractor and truck and boats from Indians outstanding .............. 450.00\nWages for freight and hauling balance of equipment and installing in the schools: ............. 500.00\n\nTotal: .......... 3,264.46\n\nKincolith: 817\n\nDeficit on wage account ........................................ 3,581.08\nRental of trucks and equipment from Indians ............ 350.00\nWages for freight and boat hire, hauling and installing lighting plants, desks, windows, and furniture to school ......................... 500.00\n\nTotal: .......... 4,431.08\n\nWe are now preparing a cost analysis of these projects, by schools under different subheads, and as soon as completed they will be forwarded to the Department. This analysis will include inventories of all equipment returned from these projects and will set up credit for them against each school. When these statements are completed, we shall then have a fairly exact picture and detailed cost analysis on these three schools.\n\nF.

Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nRe: Hartley Bay, Greenville & Kincolith School Construction\n\nIt will be noted from the attached correspondence from Supt. Anfield that a further accountable advance of approximately $8,700.00 is required as soon as possible to pay deficit wage and machinery rental accounts now outstanding.\n\nIt will be necessary to transfer funds to meet these accounts and it is recommended that $8,500.00 be transferred from the Cape Mudge school appropriation which, together with the credit remaining in the appropriation for the Greenville school will complete the construction of these schools. It is recommended that the above transfer be carried out and that an accountable advance of $8,700.00 be forwarded to this office as soon as possible.\n\nW.S.

So far, it has not been returned, though it is believed that it was signed by the natives concerned.

As soon as we can locate this man after fishing, we will have him sign our third copy of this payroll and forward same to the Department for their record. In the meantime, would you be good enough to return the cancelled cheque, as this will be required by the Department's Auditor, when he calls on his annual visitation.\n\nThese documents are forwarded in this way, rather than hold-up the clearing up of this credit voucher by the Treasury Board.\n\nSigned F.

You will note that we have on hand $756.44 required for Hartley Bay and this is going forward at once.\n\nRegarding Kincolith we have not sufficient funds to meet all requirements, and we are, therefore, forwarding Mr. Anfield $3,602.48 to cover the deficit on wages.\n\nThere is sufficient funds to the credit of Lakalsap to permit us to forward $3,037.46.\n\nbefore transferring the amount of $650 from other projects to Kincolith we would like to know definitely if the amounts mentioned on the attached statement are final or are there still outstanding accounts on these three schools and if so, what are their amounts. We hope that it will not be necessary to transfer further funds but if it is, we wish to do it at one time consequently we would appreciate it if we could have a reply at the earliest possible date.\nWe are forwarding to Mr. Anfield an accountable advance of $600. This provides an amount of $200 for each school for moving the furniture, desks etc. In our signal of August 24 we advised you that this item should be charged to allotment 12-15.

J. Scoll, the teacher of the Hazelton School, relating thereto.\n\nTherewith it is pointed out and quoted that the conditions for making aberrations in that respect - as per Indian Day School Regulations, 6th para-\n\n- are not allowed except with the express approval of the Department; and when the varying conditions arise and present themselves, it becomes of no avail to see, then such permits upon an application.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nInd. Day School\nHazelton B.C.\nMay 29th/16\n\nSecretary\nDept. of Ind. Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAccording to printed rules I have in my possession I understand that the summer holidays for Ind. Day Schools begin July 1st and that no change is to be made without the express approval of the Dept. For the summer of 1914 I obtained permission to keep open for two weeks in July; but unfortunately the School was not benefited.\nas the fish were running early that year, and the children went off to their fish camps.\n\nLast year 1915 I did not write for permission to prolong the school session, and it so happened that the last day of June I closed with seventeen children, and opened in September with five.

Seal, the Teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School, asking the Department of an increase of her present salary of $600.00 per annum, or $150.00 per quarter, and setting forth the extraordinary high cost of living in these parts. Also, is it remarked that the Department may kindly consider that the attending expenses in carrying on a school in connection with the necessary amount of firewood, and outlays for proper cleaning, janitor, repairs, etc., etc., may become covered by the sum of $100.00 per annum, at the very lowest estimate, possible.\n\nPertaining and in review of the facts given of the foregoing, and Miss Seal's reasonable request in regard thereto, I can conscientiously lend my support, by having additionally in mind that Miss Seal is easily the most valuable Teacher of this District, and has given results of a high degree by concentrating the best efforts to her calling, at a steady and long service.\n\nMoreover, in the instance for a lady of refinement, her services are those rather prompted by higher ideals and devotion than any other motive, which, in the premises, has made itself abundantly manifest in the past.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nTo the Manager of Indian Affairs\nEducational Dept.\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOwing to the cost of living here I beg to say I should be glad if the Department would see fit to raise the present salary of the Hazelton day School.\n\nAug 23rd/13\nThe average wage of the place for a single person is, I believe, $100.00 per month.

The Department supplies material such as flannelette, etc., which is made up into serviceable articles of clothing and given upon completion as rewards to deserving pupils. If you are willing to take up this work I would ask you to quote prices for supplies if they can be had at Hazelton.\n\nOthers of our teachers are doing very good work among the Indian women on the reserves, visiting them in their homes, giving them practical instruction in housekeeping, sanitation, sewing, etc., in some cases having classes on stated days or evenings for this kind of work. The department will, therefore, expect you to devote a portion of your time at least out of schools hours to these visitations and to receive reports at intervals upon your work. The Department will be pleased to receive some suggestions from you as to the best plan in which to carry out this work.\n\nMiss E. J. [signature], Teacher, Hazelton, Skeena River, B.C.\n\nAsst.

Seal - is preeminent for proficiency and applicability of imparting it, and the results derived are most excellent in comparison.\n\nTherefore, I would respectfully recommend that her salary be increased to the amount of $600.00 per annum.\n\nThis Teacher, aside of being highly qualified, applies the whole of her time, on a very intelligent and consistent basis, solely to the progress of that school. In connection therewith she has the happy faculty of ingratiating herself with the pupils' parents by visiting their homes, in order, to obtain and preserve a good attendance where the distractions from school, as here at Hazelton, are constant and so varied.\n\nBy an unfailing tact and effectiveness Miss Seal contrives to have the clearest of class rooms, preserves perfect discipline, and has moulded the pupils of this school in manners and deportment, and general good behaviour, reaching as well beyond its confines. I here, moreover, beg to add that Miss Seal, as a diligent and continuous worker, has taught school for four years at Metlakatla, and took up her present work since the 1st of September 1905; and upon conclusive judgment will remain with it.\n\nPurely in recognition of the merits this case deserves, am I impelled to recommend the Department's favourable consideration coupled with the fact that here, under existing conditions, a lady's expenses for subsistence are extremely high.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is most encouraging. This is case where the Church has built the school house, which is clean and well kept.\n\nF. H. DuVernet\nBishop of Caledonia\nThe Secretary, of Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nAbsence from the mainland at Massett, B.C.I., has delayed my answering your letters of Feb 13 and 19, No 67,340-1, and 125,342-1 which awaited my return.\n\nI take these letters as asking for my candid opinion upon what we all feel to be a most difficult problem. Let me say first that I am most anxious to assist the Department in every possible way in carrying out their new policy of improved Day Schools. I have thought the matter over long and carefully and discussed it with some of our missionaries. I am quite willing to sacrifice denominational pride for the best interests of the Indians. Allow me to express my views freely in hope of helping the cause.\n\n1. No one policy will suit all parts of Canada. It is necessary to modify a general policy according to local conditions. The policy of an improved day school as outlined by the Department seems to suggest the Prairies rather than British Columbia.\n\n2. Speaking for the Church of England in Northern British Columbia let me try and explain the local conditions.\n\nWe began Christian work among the Coast Indians over fifty years ago. Our 2,300 Christianized Indians have their homes in villages, most of them live in modern houses, dress well &c. In almost every village there is a clergyman and his wife and family. The clergyman is practically a doctor.\n\nWithout\nWithout any remuneration he is constantly tending the sick, gives practical advice, tells them the danger of evil germs, urges them to keep their houses clean, his wife (like Mrs. Collison of Kincolith) is constantly giving the women hints in domestic matters, there is a day school in the village, usually taught by a white woman, a single lady who lives with the missionary and his wife. It would be impossible for a single lady to live elsewhere in the village. The cost of reaching these villages up the rivers is considerable. The freight on food &c. is excessive, and yet the Department only allows $500.00 a year, subject to reduction, to keep up this Day School, pay travelling expenses and teacher's salary. I have inspected the Day Schools at Metlatac, Kitkatla, Massett, Kincolith, Lakkal-zag, Aiyansh, Gitwangak, Hazelton &c., and found, not as I have found east of the Rockies, three or four children in a school, but from fifteen to forty-five. The younger generation of our Indians have all passed through these Day Schools and the result is far beyond what the Department could possible expect from such inadequate support. I have heard a young Indian man read the lessons in Church in English better than many white men could and yet he had had no other education than that obtained at the village day school. Viewed in the light of relative expenditure I have no hesitation in saying that there has been far greater returns from the Day School than the so-called Industrial School which on the per capita system could not afford to keep first class trades instructors. It is on this ground that I appeal to the Department to use some of the money saved from the closing of our Metlatac Industrial School and strengthen these Day Schools which under great disadvantages have accomplished so much good.\n\nIt seems\nIt seems invidious for me to name two of these Day Schools and leave the others out. I mentioned Massett because it is the largest Day School, so on the roll, and the place is 60 miles from the mainland, and Aiyansh because a school midway between Aiyansh and Gitlakdamiks would answer both villages and give a good number of children but all these Day Schools should be considered and an increased grant made.\n\nAccepting the policy of the improved Day School and applying it to our local conditions here what are the modifications necessary?\n\nFrom the description given of our villages it will be seen that a nurse is scarcely needed. Some one should have authority to inspect the Indian houses and order a thorough disinfecting once or twice a year.\n\nExcept in the case of a school midway between Aiyansh and Gitlakdamiks a mid-day meal does not seem necessary. Many of our Indians are adopting our food. They all have kitchen stoves. They know how to cook. They are not in want. It is mistaken policy for the Government to relieve the parents of the duty of providing for their children.\n\nIn regard to industrial training, very few of the children attending day school are old enough to profit from a course of industrial training.\n\nThe very best thing the Government could do for our Indians is to employ a first class carpenter and boat-builder and have him visit our villages in turn forming classes of young men from 16 up. Most of our Indians are very quick with tools, the Massett men build fine schooners. A skilled white man could teach them much that would be most useful in a short course. It would not be necessary to visit each village.\nvillage each year.\n\nLet me now mention the one great difficulty in the way of making the Day School meet the need of the ordinary Indian child. Absence from home at certain seasons. If our Indians lived all the year round in their villages there would be no need whatever for Boarding Schools or Industrial Schools except one central undemocratical one for a few of the most promising and perfectly sound children, but this is not the case. The cannery season from June 15 to Sept. 1st. does not seriously interfere as most of this is vacation time, but in most of our villages there is another season which comes in March or April when the parents go off and take their children. They would gladly leave them behind them if we could in any way house and feed them for a few weeks. I have thought much over this and talked it over with our leading missionaries. They all agree that this is the problem.\n\nMeet this difficulty and the Day School is all that the ordinary child needs, and the parents will not feel the separation as in the case of a distant Boarding School. \"My child might as well be dead\" said one mother bitterly when she found she could not get her child back for eight years.\n\nIn some cases only a few of the people go away at one time. If we had a man and his wife in charge, a tent that would hold a dozen children, with blankets &c might meet the need. I think the parents would be willing to provide food for their children during their absence. Our Missionaries are willing to co-operate as they see the importance of keeping the children at school. The difficulty is that an equipment is needed for a short time.\n\nTo come to details. Nasset has 50 children on the roll.\n\nIf anything...\nIf anything in the way of an improved Day School is attempted, this school should stand first. If the Department takes up the proposal to have a joint school midway between Aiyansh and Gitladamiks, giving a midday meal I understand that the Aiyansh people will give 1 and 1/2 acres, and Gitladamiks the same on the boundary. There is a good road winter and summer. Distance from each village about one mile. As the Department has promised new school houses there should be economy in combining buildings, salaries etc.\n\nAs to Hazelton we have a splendid teacher there, Miss Scal, who also is a deaconess and visits the native people in their homes. I have heard that the Methodists are pressing for a Boarding School there. The Church of England has in Hazelton and neighbourhood about 600 Indians, the Methodists none in Hazelton but in the vicinity (10 miles north and 10 miles south) about 270, the Salvation Army a few dozen, the Roman Catholics have a village 3 or 4 miles away.\n\nPlainly the only way to have a successful Boarding School is for us all to unite upon an inter-denominational school with the privilege of giving religious instruction to our own flock. So far as our Indians in Hazelton are concerned an improved day school on the line indicated would, I think, meet the need. Why should the Government take children away from their parents and clothe and feed them when these parents live in good houses, earn good wages etc.?\n\nAs I have already pointed out travelling expenses are high, the cost of living much greater than in the East, it is necessary to offer a man and his wife a good salary to make\nto make it worth their while to go to an out of the way place and live among Indians. I earnestly trust that the Department will recognize the fact that the Day Schools cannot be made efficient on $300.00 a year. Until I know how much the salary is to be I cannot very well secure capable teachers but I shall be looking out for such.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF.H.

Field relieving him of the Indian School work.\n\nIt is now twenty-five years ago since the Church of England began work among the Indians of Hazelton. The Rev. J. Field has been labouring there for nineteen years, teaching the Indian Day School etc., for some years he drew the Indian Department's grant for the day school but through excessive conscientiousness he has taught the Indian Day School for the last four or five years without asking for the grant Government grant. The Church of England has erected a fine new building for this work and the average attendance of scholars has been very fair. Now that we have decided to strengthen the school work at Hazelton we appeal to the Indian Department through you for a renewal of the Government grant. Our conference also decided to send a qualified teacher to Yishgegas, a Church of England Mission sixty miles above Hazelton where we have kept an Indian Day School for some years past, unaided by the Government except the year Dr. Ardagh taught the school there. We appeal for a day school grant for this important station on the Babine river.\n\nWe notice in the public press that there is a talk of establishing an Industrial School at Hazelton under Methodist auspices.

The children during that month are gardening, and the average for that month is the lowest of the year.\n\nMy reason for asking this favour is as follows. The clergyman in whose house I have been living since I\ncame to Hazelton in 1905 is obliged on health grounds to go South for a time. It is expedient that someone should go with him, his wife for various reasons is unable to do so, his son is in the Army. They have no other relations, therefore it seems to me, I should help them in this their time of need. I will do my best to fill in the time thus given, keeping open Easter week and two weeks in July.\n\nHoping sincerely that the Dept will kindly consent to this unusual request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE. J. Soal\n\nTo the Assistant Deputy & Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\n\nNo.\n\nALSO\n\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to state that by Miss E. J. Seal, the teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School, I have in haste been requested to forward to the Department a letter of current date in application, setting forth the reasons, of being permitted to close this school for the month of May; and in lieu thereof she would keep it open during Easter week and for two weeks in July, next.\n\nThough the request in the premises is somewhat an unusual one, but for reasons that during the month of May, of necessity of planting the gardens and thus the attendance of pupils is being rendered lower for the period first under consideration and larger in comparison under the second, I here beg respectfully to recommend the request to be granted, if possible, in view of the attendant conditions thereby to be served, and as really being to the advantage of the school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. O. S. Larter has kindly informed me that a teacher will be had upon the time of Miss Soal leaving off her work, and that a Mrs. Dungate, of Terrace, B.C., had been selected to take over the duties of Miss Soal.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Day School I am sending in my resignation to take place the end of March, as I am then getting married. I have much enjoyed my work with the children; it has been a pleasure to see their young minds developing. I have also had the satisfaction of seeing the children of my former children coming to School which has added to the interest of my work.\n\nI am marrying the last week in March, I must therefore close the School just before the end of the quarter, not later than Friday, March 27th. I should be glad if the Dept. would please forward to me before the end of March, as I am then leaving Hazelton for the South, the salary due to me for this quarter, also the janitor's allowance as I pay him monthly.\nI am glad to say that my work among the Indians will still continue, as my future home will be at Metlakatla B.C.\n\nThanking the Dept. for their kindly consideration.\n\nYours truly,\nE.J. Soal\n(Teacher)\nJuly 24, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 18th of March last, in which you recommend that the teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School be allowed to take holidays during the months of May and June for which permission was granted, I beg to say that Mr. Inspector Cairns, in his report on this school, does not consider that this was a wise arrangement, and you will be good enough to inform the teacher that the vacation of this school will have to be taken at the regular time, in future.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nR. H. Loring, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton,\nB. C.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR CAIRNS ON THE HAZELTON DAY SCHOOL.\n\nAt Hazelton the day school was closed. I saw the Agent, Mr. Loring, and he said it had been arranged to take the annual holidays in May and June. I am not convinced it is a wise arrangement. The Indians must have been home during May and it is quite certain they will not be home during July and August. This looks to me like closing the school for four months.\n\nDate of Report - July 11th\nOttawa, February 17, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing a communication from Miss Elizabeth J. Soal in which she tenders her resignation as teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School to take effect on the 31st of March next.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the resignation of Miss Soal is accepted. The Department regrets to lose her services which have been satisfactory during the long period which she taught this school.\n\nThe cheque for her March quarter salary as well as the amount due for janitor's services will be forwarded in time to reach Hazelton by the 21st of March, the date on which she gives up her duties.\n\nYou will be good enough to see that she prepares and forwards a return showing the attendance for the period she taught during the said quarter and, if correct, you should certify and forward in the usual way. You should also forward a voucher for the payment of the services of the janitor with receipt attached.\n\nIt is noted that Mrs. Dungate will take up the duties of teacher upon the retirement of Miss Soal. The Department will consent to her appointment temporarily pending the receipt of information from you as to her age, qualifications and denomination to which she belongs. You should furnish these particulars as soon as possible. The question of salary will be determined upon receipt of the above information and you will be further advised thereto. The date on which Mrs. Dungate begins duties should also be stated.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nR. Moring, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton,\nB. C.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to state herewith that it has been requested of me to enquire whether Mrs. Eva Dungate, the teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School, could hope for an increase of her salary from the present standard, i.e., $600.00 to such of $700.00 per annum, and trust that it may be permissible to enclose herewith her note to me of the 3rd instant to that effect.\n\nIn favour and support of this application, I beg to mention that Mrs. Dungate is an excellent teacher and the evidence of her success is in every way most pronouncedly in evidence, after the period of one year having lapsed.\n\nWith further regard thereto, I beg to mention that on the 5th instant we had an examination with distribution of prizes at this school wherein also articles of knitting, crochet work with other exhibits being displayed, the ladies of the townsite attending denoted great admiration upon the same, together with the general progress shown, and at the beautiful way and with what perfect rhythm the movements of calisthenics were executed to the accompaniment of the organ, inclusive of the deportment of the pupils, on the whole.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOTTAWA.\nDear Mr. Soring,\n\nAs I have just completed twelve months as teacher at the Hazelton Indian Day School, I am writing to ask whether I am entitled to have my salary augmented from $600 to $700 per annum. The children's progress is sufficient proof of my capabilities awaiting a favorable reply.\n\nI am\n\nYours truly,\nE. Duigate\nWith reference to Departmental letter, dated the 17th of February last, and stating that the resignation of Miss E. J. Seal, late teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School, had been accepted, and that the cheque for her March quarter salary would be forwarded as well as the amount due for janitor's services in time to reach Hazelton by the 21st ultimo, and instructing me that I attend to both of these returns as to their transmission in the usual way, I have the honour to state that Miss Seal did promise to let me have both returns in due time.\n\nThereafter Miss Seal stated that she would forward them from Metlakatla, her adopted home.\n\nBut, though I wired at my own expense, neither reply or returns have thus far as yet reached me.\n\nThe Cheques Nos. 3056 and 3057, for $175.00 and $15.00, dated the 4th ultimo, were delivered to Miss Seal by me under the 13th of that month, respectively.\n\nAt present, Miss Seal (now Mrs. Rev. A. E. Price) is supposed to be sojourning in California.\n\nRegarding the foregoing I exceedingly regret that the said returns are not inclusive of the number forwarded, collectively.\n\nMiss Seal, during her time of fourteen years, has always been a paragon of punctiliousness, and no doubt but that the matter soon will be adjusted whereat I will strain all the efforts at my disposal.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, March 25, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant furnishing information in regard to Mrs. Eva Dungate and stating that she is prepared to report at your office on the 24th instant, in order to take up the duties as teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School on the first proximo.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this information is satisfactory and the Department approves of the appointment of Mrs. Dungate as teacher of this school. She will be allowed a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum from the time she takes charge. Kindly inform her accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. B. McLEAN\nAsst.

He suggests that it would be well if you would instruct the constable to use pressure with the Indian parents and have them send their children regularly to school.\n\nIt might improve the attendance if the constable was to inform the parents that it is expected that they will see that the children of school age attend each day school is in operation and you may issue the necessary instructions to the constable to that effect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. S. Williams\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. E. Loring, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nExtract from Report of Inspector on the Hazelton Indian Day School, Dated September 29, 1920. Original on 125342-6\n\nAbout 12 of the 30 pupils attend regularly. The attendance at this school should be better. It would be well for the agent to use his constable to put on pressure.\n\nI spoke to Dr. Wrinch about examining all the pupils under his jurisdiction. I am anxious that a beginning may be made along this line in our day schools. There are five schools in and near Hazelton. One girl aged 16 years died during the year. She was enrolled in the school.\n\nR. H. Cairns,\nInsp.\nOttawa, May 3, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th ultimo enclosing a communication from Mrs. Eva Dungate, teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School, in which she applies for an increase of $100.00 in her salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to grant her the increase she asks for. This increase will date from the first of April, last. She will, therefore, be paid at the rate of $700.00 per annum from that date. You will be good enough to inform her accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. E. Lorin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Agent Loring applies for an increase of salary for Mrs. Eva Dungate, teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nMrs. Dungate was appointed teacher at this school on April 1st, 1919, at a salary of $600.00 per annum. She has no professional qualifications. Mr. Inspector Cairns, in his report of inspection, states that she is a woman of good education and had been a governess in England. There was an enrolment of 34 pupils, with an average attendance of 12 during the past year. The Inspector states that he likes the way she handles her school and that the work is well organized. She gives instruction in knitting and sewing to the girls. The Agent states that she is an excellent teacher and the evidence of her success is very pronounced.\n\nBesides her salary Mrs. Dungate has received the bonus of $150.00.\n\nShe requests an increase of $100.00 and I would like to be informed as to whether you approve of this being granted her.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6392, File 814-1, part 1)\nOTTAWA, February 1, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant, informing the Department that Miss Lilian Shore has been appointed teacher of the Hazelton Indian day school, and that she commenced duties at the first of the year. We note that her appointment is approved by His Grace the Archbishop of Caledonia and Mr. Inspector Cairns.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Shore. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $75 per month for the ten teaching months in the year, which will be supplemented by any bonus provided by law. You will be good enough to inform Miss Shore of approval having been granted for her appointment, and the salary she will receive.\n\nI have also to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, enclosing a communication from Miss Shore in which she requests that the Department pay her travelling expenses, amounting to $30.60, from Lytton to Hazelton.\n\nRegarding travelling expenses of teachers, I beg to say that the Department does not, unless in very exceptional cases, pay the transportation expenses of teachers to and from schools. In rare cases when teachers had to travel to remote points we have allowed transportation expenses. The Superintendent of Indian Education is familiar with the conditions under which Miss Shore gave up duties at the Lytton Industrial School and took charge of the Hazelton day school, and considers that, under the circumstances, favourable consideration should be given to the payment of her transportation expenses. You may, therefore, forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenses incurred by Miss Shore in travelling from Lytton to the school. It is to be understood, however, that payment in this case is not to form a precedent for the payment of travelling expenses of teachers, as the Department cannot undertake the cost of the transportation of teachers unless in very exceptional circumstances, and in such cases authority should first be obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. Hyde, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a letter which I have received from Miss Lilian Shore, teacher at the Hazelton Indian Day School, in which she respectfully asks if it is possible to have her expenses from Lytton to Hazelton refunded.\n\nOwing to the recent changes at the Lytton Indian School (St. George's) Miss Shore was asked by School Inspector Cairns to take the position at the Hazelton Indian Day School, although expenses were not mentioned Miss Shore imagined the Indian Agent to be in a position to reimburse her, as you know living expenses are high in these parts, and to encourage a good class of teacher, I feel that it is my duty to the Department, as well as taking an interest in the teaching staff to recommend the payment of expenses in such circumstances.\n\nI may add that a female teacher in this town has to pay from $45.00 for board and lodgings, exclusive of washing and other minor expenses; therefore, you can imagine how difficult it is to secure the services of qualified persons to teach Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT;\n\nEnc.\nMISS LILIAN SHORE\nST. GEORGE'S SCHOOL\nLYTTON, B.C.\n\nHazeltown\n\n13th January 1923\n\nDear Mr. Hyde,\n\nI should be glad to know whether the Indian Department would grant me my expenses incurred in reaching Hazeltown, as I left St. George's School, Lytton, for that purpose.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6392, File 814-1, part 1)\npurpose. I am very glad indeed to take charge of the Indian Day School at Hazelton, and feel sure the Department will agree that the amount due for railway fares etc., is more than I can manage.\n\nThe expenses run as follows\u2014\n\nRailway fare from $ - e\nHazelton to Vancouver - 6 - 35.\n1/3 fare Vancouver to Hazelton - 21 - 50.\nSleeper from Prince Rupert to Hazelton 2 - 75\n\n$30 - 60\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVilain Shore\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that His Grace the Archbishop of Caledonia has secured the services of Miss Lilian Shore as teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School, and commenced her duties after the Christmas holidays.\n\nMiss Lilian Shore taught at the St. George's School, Lytton, B.C., until the recent changes, that of employing male teachers took place, when at the request of school Inspector Cairns she accepted the position offered to her by the Archbishop of Caledonia; she came well and worthily recommended by the Rev. A.R. Lett, Mr. Indian Agent Graham and R.H. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Day Schools. I have no doubt about the pupils making progress under her tuition. I am well satisfied with the appointment and recommend that the Department confirms same.\n\nSalary to be as that paid the Rev. Thomas Proctor viz., $75.00 per month for the 10 teaching months in the year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.;\nOttawa, December 14th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Mrs. Helen Roberts who taught at Hazelton Indian Day School during the past school year, did not return to take up her duties after the summer holidays. His Grace The Archbishop of Caledonia was unable to obtain the services of a properly qualified teacher and consequently Rev. Thos. Proctor, the Church of England Minister at Ha-elton, has taken over the duties as teacher from the 2nd of October last. We will approve of his appointment until a qualified teacher can be obtained, and the salary allowed him will be at the rate of $75.00 per month, supplemented by any bonus provided by law.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Thos. Proctor has taken over the duties as teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School, from the 2nd of October last, as Mrs. Roberts the former teacher did not return after the summer holidays.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we will approve of the appointment of Rev. Mr. Proctor until the services of a properly qualified teacher can be obtained by the Bishop. The salary allowed him for his services will be at the rate of $75.00 per month for the 10 teaching months in the year. He will also be entitled to any bonus provided by law.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nE. Hyde, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report that owing to the failure of the return of Mrs. Helen Roberts after the Summer holidays and the difficulty His Grace The Archbishop of Caledonia has in getting a suitable person to fill the position, the Rev. Thomas Proctor, Church of England Minister of Hazelton, took over the duties at the School on the 2nd October and will continue teaching until such time as the Bishop can obtain the services of a properly qualified teacher.\n\nIn view of the good attendance and work the Rev. Mr. Proctor is doing I recommend that he be paid at the rate of $750.00 per annum, ten teaching months.\n\nMy reason for not reporting this matter sooner was owing to the uncertainty of getting a suitable teacher.\n\nOn visiting the School today the Rev. Mr. Proctor informed me that the Bishop has been absent from his Headquarters at Prince Rupert for the last month, which would convey to me the reason I have failed to hear anything further.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

She has completed 13 years of satisfactory service. Very favourable reports have been received regarding her work. The local agent recommends, on account of her faithful service, that she be granted a gratuity upon retirement.\nKamloops, B.C., June 15th, 1932.\n\nINSPECTION REPORT BABINE AGENCY NO. 7.\n\nThere seems to be considerable dissatisfaction amongst the Indian parents over the progress of the children at the school under Miss Dungate. The gist of the complaint is that the children do not get sufficient instruction in English, and that, owing to this lady's age, the discipline is poor. However, I made no personal enquiry into the matter as I know Captain Barry, Inspector of Schools will know whether there is any cause for complaint or not.\n\nG.S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nVictoria, B.C., June 20, 1932.\n\nThe Inspector's observations regarding the Hazelton Indian Day School has been placed for consideration by the District Inspector of Indian schools.\n\nW.E. Ditchburn,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, November 27, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, requesting that, on account of the attendance at the Hazelton Indian Day School, the services of an assistant teacher be obtained for the next three months.\n\nIn reply I regret that the Department has no funds to pay the salary of another teacher. It is considered that Mrs. Dungate, the teacher, should be able, by exercising firmness, to obtain proper discipline in the classroom and carry on the work for the balance of the present school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nThe Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nI respectfully beg to draw your attention to the following:\n\nOn November 13th I had occasion to visit the above Indian Day School and, I am sorry to say, I found things very unsatisfactory. Mrs. Eva Dungate, the Teacher, was doing her best in trying to control forty pupils and found it well nigh impossible to do so. Whilst teaching the advanced pupils in grade 7 and lesser grades the younger pupils of grade 1 carry on such a chattering noise that it is practically impossible to teach the older scholars.\n\nMay I suggest that Mrs. Dungate be granted an assistant teacher for the next three months. A suitable assistant can be procured here at a salary of $50.00 per month. No doubt the attendance will decrease after February 1932 - which it usually does - and, if such is the case, Mrs. Dungate will then carry on alone.\n\nIf an assistant teacher is appointed for the three months mentioned no alteration to the school would be necessary for the present.\n\nWhen Mr. Gerald H. Barry, Inspector of Indian Schools for B.C., visited Hazelton he was very much satisfied with the progress made at this school. I am sure Mr. Barry, knowing the large number of pupils attending this school, would have no hesitation in recommending the temporary assistant teacher asked for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 11, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, informing the Department that Mrs. Eva Dungate, teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School, has been ordered to take a rest from school duties for a short time on account of her health. The Department regrets the illness of Mrs. Dungate, and hopes that she will be able to resume duties at an early date. It is noted that Rev. Mr. Bannister, the Anglican minister at Hazelton, will act as substitute teacher during Mrs. Dungate's illness. The arrangements made for teaching services at this school during Mrs. Dungate's absence are approved.\n\nWhen forwarding the return showing attendance, days' taught, etc., for the current quarter, it should be definitely stated thereon the dates between which Mrs. Dungate was absent and the period taught by Rev. Mr. Bannister.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that Mrs. Eva Dungate, Teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School, has been ordered by Dr. Wrinch to take a rest from school duties for a short time as she is on the verge of a nervous break-down.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Bannister, Anglican Minister at Hazelton, is substituting for Mrs. Dungate at the school during her time of indisposition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6392, File 814-1, part 1)\nOttawa, February 2, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department will allow Mrs. Eva Dungate, teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School, an increase of $5 per teaching month in her salary from the 1st of April, next. This will make her salary from that date at the rate of $95 per teaching month. Mrs. Dungate is being informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nOttawa, February 2, 1931.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd ultimo, requesting an increase in your salary as teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of an increase of $5 per teaching month from the 1st of April, 1931, the beginning of the new fiscal year. This will make the total salary allowed you from that date at the rate of $95 per teaching month. Our funds are limited and there are many demands, and the above is the full increase that can be provided. We have noted the large attendance and reports that have been received regarding your satisfactory services.\n\nMr. Agent Mortimer, Hazelton, is being informed of the increase granted you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

C.\nJan. 22. 1931\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAs this is my eleventh year as teacher at the Hargleton Indian Day School, I am writing to ask whether the Dept. would consider my application to augment my salary. I am now receiving $900. a year.\n\nSince Capt. Mortimer has been Indian Agent the schools have been much more interesting, and during this last twelve months the attendance has more than doubled; which of course means more work. The average attendance is 38-40 at the same time the parents are most interested and anxious that their children are well educated.\n\nIf you remember one of my pupils (Joseph Smith) won a Bronze Medal for an Essay on the History of Confederation. I mention this and the general progress of all the pupils to show that I have faithfully carried out my duties as teacher. Capt. Mortimer has often said that my\nschool is one of the best; but when the question of raising my salary was mentioned his Scotch instinct came to the rescue.\n\nIn this North Country the cost of living is very high. Printing my application will be considered.\n\nI am\n\nYour obedient servant\nEva Wingate\nOttawa, October 9, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, enclosing a communication addressed to the Secretary of the Department from Mrs. Eva Dungate, teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School, in which she requests that the services of an assistant teacher be engaged, on account of the attendance of the Indian children.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that our funds for the present fiscal year are limited, and it will, therefore, not be possible to consider the appointment of a second teacher. This matter might again be drawn to the attention of the Department early next Summer, at which time full particulars should be given as to the accommodation that could be provided for an extra classroom and what furnishings or other supplies would be necessary. An estimate of the cost involved in fitting up an extra classroom should be given. In the meantime, the present arrangements for the carrying on of the teaching services at this school will have to be continued.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nC. C. Mortimer Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nRe Assistant for Hazelton Indian Day School\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter received from Mrs Eva Dungate, Indian Day School Teacher, Hazelton, B.C., the envelope was addressed to this office in mistake.\n\nSeeing that the letter deals with a request for an assistant for the Hazelton Reserve Indian Day School at Hazelton, B.C. I must say that I concur with Mrs Dungate the Teacher, the school in question comes under my personal observations daily, and I have no hesitation in saying that the attendance has increased greatly since the school opened in September 1930.\n\nIt would be very beneficial to the Indian children of the Hazelton Indian Day School, if assistance was given to Mrs Dungate the Teacher.\n\nI intended dealing with this matter in Agent's Report re Indian Day Schools.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In Grades I, II, III, IV, V., are 30, 6, 5, 7, 2 respectively totalling 48. Grade 7 especially needs supervising the whole time.\n\nTreating my application will be considered.\n\nI remain\n\nYours Truly,\nEva Dungate - Teacher.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter dated the 11th November last, having reference to Mr. Inspector Cairns's report on his inspection of the Hazelton Indian Day School last Oct., regarding irregular attendance of the pupils.\n\nI beg to inform you that I have had this school under personal observation for the past two months and I am glad to report that the attendance shows marked improvement. I have instructed the Dominion Constable to pay regular visits to the school and to warn the parents of defaulting children.\n\nIt has come to my knowledge that it has been rumored among the Indians here, that a residential school for the Indians will be built on the Hazelton Indian Reserve next year. I mentioned the matter to Mrs. Dungate, the teacher, who informed me that the Rev. Mr. T. Proctor, the Anglican preacher at Hazelton, had told her such a school was going to be built across the Skeena River on the west portion of the Hazelton Indian Reserve. I am of the same opinion as Mrs. Dungate that such unfounded rumors have made the parents think that by not sending their children to the Indian Day School a Residential School would be provided.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\nOttawa, November 11th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns, in a report on his inspection of the Hazelton Indian Day School, dated October 1st, last, states that the teacher is capable of doing excellent work, but that, on account of irregular attendance, the standard of education is very low. Many of the parents are not interested in the education of their children. The Inspector recommends that, as a new Dominion Constable has been appointed, he be asked to pay particular attention to the attendance of the pupils.\n\nIf you consider it advisable to comply with the Inspector's recommendation, you should arrange with the Constable to interview the parents and endeavour, as far as possible, to see that they send their children regularly to school. I shall be pleased to hear from you later as to the results of any action taken to improve the attendance at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE.

I note that you protest concerning a fence which is being placed on the school property. This is a matter which you quite properly should discuss with Mr. Indian Agent Hyde.

I gathered from him that in the event of my resigning, I was entitled to one month's pay, minus bonus. Unfortunately my husband met with a serious accident, breaking his hip which necessitated my resigning, & having to remain at home after the holidays. I am writing to enquire why I have not received the payment.\n\nYours Respectfully,\nHelen C. Roberts\nMiss Shore who had charge of the kindergarten and junior work at St. George's School at Lytton has taken charge of the Indian day school at Hazelton. Miss Shore has had training and will do especially good work in this new position. In her letter to me she says that so far she has had only twenty pupils. She finds the pupils very far behind and except for reading are only in the kindergarten state. She is confident that she can get results.\nOTTAWA, February 1, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department has approved of the appointment of Miss Lillian Shore as teacher of the Hazelton Indian day school, from the first of the present year, at a salary of $75 per month for the ten teaching months in the year, supplemented by any bonus provided by law.\n\nMr. Agent Hyde has forwarded a communication from Miss Shore in which she requests to be reimbursed for the amount expended by her in travelling from Lytton to Hazelton. Regarding travelling expenses of teachers, I beg to say that the Department does not, unless in very exceptional cases, pay transportation of teachers to and from schools. In a few cases where teachers had to travel to remote points, we allowed transportation expenses. The Superintendent of Indian Education is familiar with the conditions under which Miss Shore gave up duties at the Lytton Industrial School, and considers that, under the circumstances, favourable consideration should be given to the payment of her transportation. It should be understood, however, that payment in this case is not to form a precedent, as the Department cannot undertake the cost of transportation of teachers unless in the circumstances as mentioned above, and in such cases authority should first be obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The salary we could allow would be at the rate of $90 per teaching month, less 10% for the present fiscal year. Please forward for the approval of the Department the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher recommended for this school. The matter of obtaining a successor to Mrs. Dungate should receive your early attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to inform you that I have received the resignation of Mrs. Dempster as teacher of the Indian day school at Hazelton. I am fortunate in being able to recommend a really good man to take her place.\n\nMr. L.T. Barnsley, now at Hazelton, would, I believe, prove a satisfactory teacher, and besides this he is very much interested in the natives and would do much more for the children than merely give them the fundamentals of an ordinary education.\n\nPersonally I would be much gratified if he were appointed to this position by your department, believing it would be a wise appointment.\n\nHe would, I feel sure, be welcomed by the natives themselves.\n\nI would be glad to hear from you informing me of your favorable action in this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG.A.

T. Bannister, now in Hazelton. His Lordship has not stated the qualifications and experience which Mr. Bannister possesses. If, after consulting Mr. Inspector Berry, you are satisfied that Mr. Bannister's services would be satisfactory, you should so inform the Department, in order that approval can be granted for his appointment.\n\nWe are informing His Lordship that enquiry is being made regarding Mr. Bannister's qualifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Lawrence for the position of Indian Day School Teacher at Hazelton.\n\nUp to the present time I have received no information from the Rev. L. F. Bannister with reference to his resignation as Teacher of the Indian Day School here. However, in the event of Mr. Bannister being transferred from Hazelton I will render every assistance I possibly can, but I may say that, as Mr. Lawrence is at present residing in Alberta and, I presume, holding some position there, it may be very difficult for him to obtain a position in B.C. I am informed by Inspector G.M. Barry, of the Indian Department, that there are over 600 teachers unemployed in B.C. You will, therefore, readily see the position in which we are both placed.\n\nMay I kindly suggest that you convey the purport of this letter to Mr. Lawrence.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(Signed) G.

H. Lawrence. I believe him to be exceptionally qualified for the position. He has the best of credentials and has had unusual experience in the work of teaching natives. I would be glad if you would take up this matter at your convenience and if I can do anything further to help the matter along I shall be pleased to do so at your suggestion.\n\nWe are having another cold snap here so I suppose you will be treated with the same sort of thing at Hazelton.\n\nWith best wishes, I am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG.

My position in this as well as other matters makes it possible to render to the executive officials of the Department disinterested and purely professional advice, and I have never considered that the position which I have the honour to hold is in any way more than an advisory one with regard to educational matters in British Columbia. I shall certainly cooperate with the Department in giving the new teacher at Hazelton every possible assistance, as suggested in your letter.\n\nI am taking it for granted that the Department will inform the Indian Agent at Hazelton of its approval of the appointment of the Reverend F.L. Banister as teacher of the Indian Day School there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nAugust 8th, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nre - Rev. L. F.

Mr. Bannister who, I stated, had made application for the position.\n\nAs you are aware this school carries a large number of pupils which is in the neighbourhood of 40 children. May I therefore suggest that a male teacher be appointed in order to keep strict discipline.\n\nEncl.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. C.

F. L. Bannister as teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School for the academic year 1932-33. Salary will be allowed him at the rate of $85 a teaching month, less 10% during the current fiscal year. Mr. Agent Mortimer is being so advised and will be instructed to give Rev. Mr. Bannister every possible assistance.\n\nOur Inspector, Mr. G. H. Barry, points out that there are many qualified teachers available in British Columbia and strongly recommends that the Department only employ such teachers in Indian schools. As the majority of the pupilage is in the primary classes where professional knowledge and experience are absolutely necessary, I feel that you will agree with me that Normal trained teachers are required if the standard of our work is to be maintained. The Department is, therefore, approving of the appointment of Rev. Mr. Bannister for one year only and we would appreciate if you would take our point of view into consideration when nominating teachers in future.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

F. L. Bannister as teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School. I believe that you will appreciate the Department's position in this matter and that you will cooperate by giving Mr. Bannister every possible assistance.\n\nIn writing Bishop Rix, the Department is pointing out to him that, in order to maintain the standard of our work, it is necessary to have Normal trained teachers and he is being requested to only nominate such in future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

When Mr. Shearman was transferred from the position as teacher of the Kitkatla School, it was definitely pointed out, in official communication to you, dated August 20th, last, that the salary rating for the Hazelton School is $250 per year. However, in view of the fact that Mr. Shearman has a larger attendance at the Hazelton School than he had at Kitkatla and also that fuel was allowed him at the last named school, it is considered that the only assistance that could be given in lieu of an increase in his salary would be to provide the wood and coal required for use in his residence.\n\nIf Mr. Shearman has already secured the full quantity of wood and coal required for the present winter's use, you should obtain receipts from him, covering the payment. You should then prepare a voucher, in triplicate, for the amount, certify same, attach receipts and forward to the Department. Consideration will then be given to reimbursing Mr. Shearman towards the costs of his outlay in the purchase of the fuel. However, if he has not procured the full quantity he requires for the balance of the present school year, you may arrange for the purchase and forward certified accounts, in the usual manner, for payment.\n\nIt should be definitely understood that the Department will be responsible only for the quantity of coal and wood required and will not be prepared to pay the cost of coal oil. This authority is for the supplying of the fuel for the use of the teacher during the present academic year only. It will be necessary to obtain authority before purchase of fuel is made for the next academic year. Please quote on your voucher the date and number of this letter as your authority when forwarding the accounts for payment of the fuel supplied for the teacher's use during the present academic year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\nOttawa, December 5th, 1936.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st ultimo, the Department approves the appointment of Mr. Noel Stewart as teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School from January 1st, 1937. He will be allowed salary at the rate of $85.00 a teaching month.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nRt. Rev. G. A. Rix, D. D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nOttawa, December 5th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn the nomination of Rt. Rev. G. A. Rix, Bishop of Caledonia, the Department is approving the appointment of Mr. Noel Stewart as teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School, at a salary of $85 a teaching month. He will begin duties on January 1st, next, and you should give him every possible assistance.\n\nThe present teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School, Rev. B. Shearman, is being transferred to the Kitwanga Indian Day School. He will begin duties at the latter school on the first proximo and will be allowed salary at the same rate as he has been receiving, viz., $90 a teaching month.\n\nI enclose circular regarding dates of opening and closing of Indian day schools, also staff questionnaire. You should have Mr. Stewart complete the latter form as soon as he commences duties. This should then be returned promptly to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\n\nEncs. 2.\n\nS. Mallinson, Esq.,\nIn charge - Babine Indian Agency,\nHazelton, B. C.\nThe Anglican Synod\nof the\nDIOCESE OF CALEDONIA.\n\nPrince Rupert, B.C.,\nNovember 21st, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is to remind you of much that you probably already know. I am more than ordinarily pleased with the staff of teachers in charge of the Native Day Schools in the Diocese of Caledonia. I have had the privilege of visiting nearly all of them recently and everyone of them seems to be doing well.\n\nI beg to recommend certain changes at Hazelton and Gitwangah.\n\nMr. Flores has left Gitwangah for Australia and Gitwangah has been temporarily supplied by Mrs. Orne, a certified teacher, who has given satisfactory service there so far. She will be in charge until the end of the year. At the beginning of the year it is Mr. Shearman's wish to leave Hazelton and take up the work at Gitwangah. This is agreed to both by the Indian Agent and myself. In his place at Hazelton we are fortunate in securing the services of Mr. Noel Stewart, who for some time has been a successful teacher at St. Paul's Indian School at Cardston, Alta. He has a first class certificate and several other special certificates which will probably be of use to him.\n\nWould you kindly confirm the changes and new appointments herein stated,\n\nThanking you for the courtesy and help of the past\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG. A. Rix.\nBishop of Caledonia.\nThe Anglican Synod of the Diocese of Caledonia.\n\nPrince Rupert, B.C.,\nNovember 21st, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is to remind you of much that you probably already know. I am more than ordinarily pleased with the staff of teachers in charge of the Native Day Schools in the Diocese of Caledonia. I have had the privilege of visiting nearly all of them recently and everyone of them seems to be doing well.\n\nAt Hazelton Mr. B. Shearman has always proved himself an efficient teacher.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG. A. Rix.\nBishop of Caledonia.\nApril 7th, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\n\nRe: School No. 814.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General has approved an increase in salary of $50.00 a year to Rev. B. Shearman, Teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School. This will make his salary from April 1st, 1936, at the rate of $90 a teaching month and the following entry should appear on the April pay list:\n\n814 - Hazelton - Rev. B. Shearman - Hazelton, B.C. - $900 - $90.00\nOttawa, January 14, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th ultimo, you may inform Rev. B. Shearman, teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School, that it has been decided to increase his salary from $85 a teaching month to $90 a teaching month, effective from April 1, 1936.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nJanuary 9, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nMr. G. C. Mortimer, Indian Agent, Hazelton, B. C., forwards a request from Rev. B. Shearman, teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School, for an increase in salary. Mr. Shearman formerly taught at Kitkatla, where he was allowed salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month. At the request of the Anglican Bishop of the diocese of Caledonia, he was transferred as teacher of the Hazelton School as from September first, 1934. The salary rating at the Hazelton School is $55 per teaching month, and this is the full amount that could be paid him. He now requests that his salary be increased to at least the amount he received during the period he taught at Kitkatla.\n\nI beg to recommend that Mr. Shearman be granted an increase of $5.00 per teaching month, as from April first, next.\nSir,\n\nre - Rev. B. Shearman, Teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from the Rev. B. Shearman with reference to an increase of salary as teacher of the Indian Day School, Hazelton. The letter is self explanatory.\n\nI may mention that Mr. Shearman is receiving an extra allowance this year of $100.00 to provide fuel for his private residence.\n\nEncl. Your obedient servant,\n\nG. C. Mortimer,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nFrom Rev. B. Shearman\nTeacher Indian Bay School\nHAZELTON British Columbia\n12 Oct 1935\n\nTo the Secretary\nDept. for Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAfter another year's service in the above school, I beg once more to bring the matter of my stipend before you. It is only $85 per month, being $5 less than I received for several years previous service at Kitkatla. This school is bigger, & my average day by day is well over 40 pupils. These I am working entirely alone in 6 feet. I have sixty pupils on board.\n\nDuring Sep. 1935 my school was officially inspected by Capt. Barry - Dept. Inspector of Schools. The same inspection was a thorough one and in discussion following the trimmings of the children, the said Inspector said, he would undoubtedly recommend an increase for me and such was likewise. His report on his visit, has since been received by you, and I would like you to kindly refer to same.\n\nI urge that my salary be increased,\n& that the same be made retrospective to September 1935.\nOn looking through back records, I see the average for corresponding time has been as low as 15, and as the average now is well over 40, the same speaks for itself\u2014i.e., the school being attractive to the pupils, and the slightest interest in the pupils by myself.\n\nI may add too, that my interest, and that of my wife is carried into the Indian house, and encouraging & helping them in every possible way.\n\nThanking you in anticipation for early favorable consideration of this letter.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nB. Sherman\nFrom Rev B. Shearman\nIndian Day School\nKazetton B.C.\n\nTo the Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to ask you that all cheques payable to me as teacher in above school be sent to me addressed as above and not to the bank at Smithers. This to take effect with next cheque payable.\n\nThanking you\n\nYours faithfully,\nB. Shearman\nOttawa, April 11, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, enclosing letter from the teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School requesting an increase in salary.\n\nPresent regulations do not permit the Department giving any increase to a teacher in any Indian day school. The situation at the Hazelton School was fully outlined in official letter of January 17, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. C.

Since Sep 1st 1934 I have been receiving only $85 per month.\n\nPreviously I taught on Kitkata Reserve for 5 years, with excellent results. Kitkata School was not so large as this Hazelton school, and I received $90 per mth.\n\nHere I am working conscientiously hard with 6 grades, and I feel that an increase is justifiable and well earned.\n\nTrusting for favourable consideration\n\nI beg to remain\nYours respectfully,\nBert Sherman.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE\nP.O. BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C.\n\nAugust 23, 1937.\n\nR.A.Hoey, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter 156-29-1 of July 20th last and in continuation of my 15/6/49867 of July 28th I wish to confirm the contents of my radio message of the 21st instant.\n\nA letter from the Right Reverend G.A.Rix, D.D., Bishop of Caledonia, dated August 17th in Prince Rupert has been received by Captain Barry, Inspector of Schools. In this letter Bishop Rix nominates a Mr. Frank Burling of P.O.Box 133 Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, as teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School, Babine Agency.\n\nIt would appear that Mr. Burling has taught in England and in Saskatchewan, is married, and about 48 years of age. Neither Captain Barry or I know anything further about this man.\n\nAs it is now rather late in the vacation it appeared best to recommend the appointment of Mr. Burling as teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School on probation, and to have our Inspector visit the Hazelton School when he is again in the northern part of the Province, probably in October.\n\nWhile in Vancouver last week on other Departmental duties, Inspector Barry called on Dr. S.S.Osterhout of the United Church of Canada, at the latter's request, to discuss a number of nominations which Dr. Osterhout proposed to send to the United Church officials in Toronto, for transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch in Ottawa. These included the following:\n\nBella Coola Indian Day School: Mr. R. Kelly from the Kitmelas Indian Day School on transfer.\n\nKitmelas Indian Day School: Mrs. Irene Wilson.\n\nPort Essington: Mr. E. B. Severson.\n\nPort Simpson: Senior Division: Miss K. How; Junior Division: Miss L. Swartz.\n\nKispiox: Still uncertain as arrangements made by the United Church have fallen through owing to illness of candidate's wife.\n\nAlberni Indian Day School: It is understood that Miss K. Pitts has been nominated by Dr. Wilson of the United Church and that her name is to be forwarded to the Indian Affairs Branch in Ottawa from Toronto.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6392, File 814-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nInspector Barry informs me that in the past when approval has been given by the Indian Affairs Branch for the appointment of a teacher of an Indian Day School nominated by one or other of the Churches concerned, a copy of the Department's letter of instructions to the Indian Agent involved has generally been sent to the Indian Commissioner in Victoria. It is from such copies of letters to the Indian Agents that the Inspector is able to keep our list of teachers in Indian Schools up to date.\n\nThus far this year I have received information of the appointment of teachers to vacant positions in the Vancouver, Lytton, Okanagan, and Kwawkewlth Agencies.\n\nWhen the nominations of the United Church have been considered in Ottawa, I should be glad to receive copies of the letters sent to the various Indian Agents. I shall thus be in a position to know the names of the teachers in all the Indian Schools in British Columbia, which I regret I do not at the moment. The information sent will be passed on to the Inspector of Schools for his lists and the letters filed in my office for future reference.\n\nMiss E. Aylwin, the teacher of the Kincolith Indian Day School Skeena River Agency, was nominated in June by the Right Reverend the Bishop of the Cariboo as teacher of the Shuswap Indian Day School, Nicola Agency. In accordance with Departmental instructions a confidential report was made by Inspector Barry to Mr. Indian Agent Barber for transmission to Ottawa, but no notification of the approval of the Indian Affairs Branch for this transfer has as far as I know been received here. If Miss Aylwin has been transferred as seems probable, I have not been informed of the appointment of a teacher at Kincolith, Skeena River Agency.\n\nIt would in my opinion be better if all nominations in B.C. of teachers to fill vacant positions be made through the Indian Commissioner's office. I should thus be in a position to advise the Indian Affairs Branch with regard to the special needs of the school in question and of the qualifications of the candidates nominated. I do not believe that it would be difficult for the Church authorities to forward their lists to me in the first place instead of directly to you in Ottawa. Through our Inspector here confidential inquiries can be made and information gathered with regard to candidates which would not be available to Ottawa. Inspector Barry considers that so far several very unsuitable nominations have been made, but that owing to the system in use nothing can be done about these at the present time. He tells me that Archbishop W.M. Duke of Vancouver and Dr. S.S. Osterhout have shown their desire to cooperate with him in the selection of the best possible candidates before forwarding their nominations to Ottawa.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your radiogram of the 21st instant - the Department is wiring you today approving the temporary appointment of Mr. Frank Burling as temporary teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School. It is noted from your radiogram that he was nominated by Bishop Rix, and that Inspector Barry will visit Hazelton in October and report on his progress. Mr. Burling will be allowed salary at the rate of $65.00 a teaching month.\n\nI enclose staff questionnaire which you should have him complete and return to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

He will be allowed salary at the rate of $90 a teaching month.\n\nThis will leave a vacancy at the Hazelton Indian Day School.

With continued help, this young man may train into a good practical teacher.\"\n\nIf Mr. Stewart returns to the Hazelton School, you should direct his attention to the necessity of preserving control in the classroom without the excessive use of corporal punishment and you should, also, inform him that he is expected to carry out suggestions made by Inspector Barry in regard to teaching methods and grade limitations in the various classes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nS.

BARRY,\nDISTRICT INSPECTOR OF INDIAN SCHOOLS, VICTORIA B.C.,\nON HIS INSPECTION OF THE HAZELTON INDIAN DAY SCHOOL\nON MAY 26th, last.\n\nName of Teacher: Mr. Noel Stewart Age 26.\n\nThis teacher is a very active young man. He has very little idea of actual teaching technique. He tells me that although he has had five years experience and regular inspection, he has never been told what to do and where he is failing. He seemed to be very glad to have my advice and critical evaluation of his work, and he promised me that he would change his somewhat harsh methods at once. He was advised to attend the Provincial Summer School in Victoria this year and to qualify in Primary Work of which he is rather ignorant at present. He may turn out a good teacher LATER.\n\nAttendance problem: remedies suggested, etc.\n\nThe children are not attending well owing to the fact that the teacher straps far too much, and fails to visit the parents when children are away. He has relied on the R.C.M.P. and ruined the tone of the school so well built up by the previous teacher. I have instructed the present teacher to visit the parents of all his pupils and not only those who may happen to be Anglicans.\n\nIN SUBMITTING THE ABOVE REPORT TO MAJOR D. M. MACKAY,\nINDIAN COMMISSIONER, MR. BARRY WRITES AS FOLLOWS:\n\nI understand that Mr. Noel Stewart will probably be leaving Hazelton at the end of June. I have not been officially informed of this fact, but I know that this young man is seeking the nomination to the Shulus Indian Day School in the Nicola Agency, and will call upon the Right Reverend the Bishop of Cariboo when passing through Kamloops on his way to Victoria.\n\nIt is very necessary that Mr. Stewart attend the next session of the Provincial Summer School in Victoria in July. He must take some training in Primary Work if he is to be a success in an Indian day school.\n\nI would ask the Indian Affairs Branch to write Mr. Stewart with regard to summer school, the necessity for the preservation of control in the schoolroom without the present excessive use of corporal punishment, and the advisability of following the suggestions of the Inspector in regard to teaching methods and Grade limitations in the various classes. With continued help this young man may train into a good practical teacher.\nOttawa, September 1, 1937\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo giving the qualifications of Mr. Frank Burling, who has been appointed teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nAs the Department did not receive the names from the Board of Home Missions of the United Church until quite recently, it was not possible to advise you regarding the names of the teachers at the Bella Coola, Kitselas, Port Essington and Port Simpson Day Schools. This information, however, was sent you in official letter of August 23.\n\nA teacher for the Kispiox School has not yet been secured.\n\nIt was only recently that it was decided to appoint Miss K. Pitts as teacher of the Alberni School. A recent letter advised you of this appointment.\n\nCopy of our letter of August 20th was forwarded to you with reference to the appointment of Mr. Green as teacher of the Kincolith School to succeed Miss Aylwin who was transferred to the Shulus School.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter - I will discuss your suggestion with the Church officials on the occasion of their next visit to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nD.M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVictoria, B. C.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the Hazelton Indian Day School dated October 16, 1938:\n\nI am not satisfied with the progress being made by the children here. Many are dirty and poorly dressed.\n\nThe Indian Agent has been very ill and not able to exercise a constant supervision of this school during the past year or I am certain he would not have permitted the present state of things to continue.\n\nI consider that the fault lies with the Anglican authority, the Right Rev. Bishop Rix, in nominating Missionary teachers without B.C. qualifications, who are in fact quite unable to teach the school, whatever they may or may not be able to do as Missionaries.\n\nAs Mr. Frank Burling's appointment was temporary in the first place so that we could see how well he got on here, I would recommend strongly that the Department arrange with Bishop Rix for a properly qualified teacher to be placed here as from September 1939 at latest.\n\n(Sgd.) Gerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B. C.\nExtract from Inspector Barry's report on the Hazelton Indian Day School dated October 16, 1938.\n\nAs you will see from my report I do not consider that Mr. Burling is a success here. He does not have the respect of the Indian parents who consider, the Indian Agent states, that their children are just wasting their time in school. They give this as a reason for not sending the children regularly.\n\nAs Mr. Burling only holds a temporary appointment and does not have a B.C. teacher's certificate, I see no reason why I should recommend that he be retained here.\n\nWe require a well qualified B.C. teacher with experience. The practice of appointing the local Missionary of the Anglican Church is a poor one, though I have little hope that the Department will wish to change this till the two room Indian day school which I have recommended is erected.\n\nI do consider that the Right Reverend Bishop Rix should be asked to nominate a properly qualified B.C. trained teacher to succeed Mr. Burling at the end of the present academic year, if not sooner.\n\nI am very sorry that I have to report in this unsatisfactory way on Mr. Burling's work. In my last report on this school, very soon after his appointment, I expressed the hope that with an experienced teacher the children would make rapid progress. It is however my duty to point out that the present condition of the Hazelton Indian day school is highly unsatisfactory. The Indian Agent is, I believe, well aware of this, though, owing to his illness, he has only been able to visit the school once since my last inspection.\n\n(Sgd.) Gerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOttawa,\nDecember 8, 1938.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a report from Inspector Barry regarding his inspection of the Hazelton Indian day school on October 16 last.\n\nIt appears that Mr. Burling is not a success at Hazelton. He does not appear to have the respect of the Indian parents who consider that their children are just wasting their time in school. As a result the children are attending very irregularly. As you are aware Mr. Burling does not hold a British Columbia certificate.\n\nIn view of the Inspector's report it is considered that a change in the teaching services at this school should be made from September 1, 1939.\n\nI am, therefore, instructing the Indian Agent to inform Mr. Burling that his services will not be required after the end of June, 1939. Please submit a nomination for a qualified teacher to take charge of this school for the academic year 1939-40.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. G. A. Rix, D.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nOttawa,\nDecember 8, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have recently received Inspector Barry's report regarding his inspection of the Hazelton Indian day school on October 16.\n\nThe report indicates that the teacher is not meeting with the success which the Department expects. Under the circumstances it has been decided to make a change in the teaching services for the academic year 1939-40 and Rt. Rev. G. A. Rix, D.D., is being requested to nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of the school on September 1 next.\n\nWhen you consider it timely you should advise Mr. Burling that his services will not be required after the end of June, 1939.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. C. Mortimer, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B. C.\nMy dear Bishop Rix,\n\nre - Mr. Frank Burling.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of 14th December regarding the adverse report you received from Mr. R.A. Heey respecting Mr. Frank Burling as teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nI am extremely sorry to say I have been in receipt of several complaints from parents regarding the progress of their children, so much so that many of the children are not attending school.\n\nPrior to Captain Barry's inspection I visited this school and was far from being satisfied as to conditions. However, I did not report the matter but awaited Captain Barry's visit and made no comments until he, Captain Barry, brought up the subject after his inspection. He was by no means satisfied and greatly disappointed with Mr. Burling.\n\nI feel, in this case, I cannot criticize Captain Barry's report.\n\nWith kindest regards and sincere greetings for Christmas and the New Year.\n\nI am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG.C.

He says he has written to you about him, and asking that he be retired from his position as teacher at Hazelton and that I should nominate someone else.\n\nI was greatly disappointed about this turn of affairs and am so writing to Mr. Hoey and I hope I may again depend on your backing as I have before. Personally I believe the school there is to be congratulated in having such a capable and really fine man as Mr. Burling. Capt. Barry seems to think he must make some criticism every year and this year it appears to be Mr. Burling. I was under the impression upon my last visit at Hazelton that Mr. Burling was giving entire satisfaction.\n\nWith best compliments of the season.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) G. A.

A. Hoey, Esq., cont'd.\n\nthe residents there, both white and native.\n\nI have said to you before that there are three things which I am anxious to have in a teacher of our Indians. I have their well being at heart perhaps more than anyone in this whole area. I feel the first necessity is:- (a) A belief in God and His Son Jesus Christ as the Saviour of the world and to know how to teach both adults and children these fundamental truths. (b) He should set a good example in life, honest, moral, clean in person and industrious. (c) Be capable of teaching the ordinary things which all should know to-day if they are going to get the most out of life.\n\nI fear an Inspector is likely to look only for the last. In the case of Mr. Burling I am satisfied that he fills the three ideals above.\n\nI very sincerely hope that you will reconsider this Hazelton matter and let me hear that Mr. Burling will be continued on as teacher at Hazelton.\n\nWith the Season's greetings,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGeo Caledonia\n\nGeorge Caledonia.\n\nIn the matter of your letter re suggesting the name of a teacher for Alert Bay.

(RG 10, Volume 6392, File 814-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nThe greatest surprise in my life came from the reports of Dr. Barry. His adverse reports generally deal with those whom I have every reason to believe are among the very best of our teachers of natives. Certainly I would have looked far afield before I could have obtained one so well qualified for the position as Mr. Burling of Hazelton. He is a gentleman in every respect, by both breeding and education, a qualified teacher with a successful career behind him. Mr. Barry has, perhaps of necessity, the habit of visiting the schools in this area just after they get started in the Fall and before nearly all the natives have returned from their fishing. Consequently he often finds the attendance small, and the children not yet settled down to work.\n\nAs to attendance, the actual figure for the average attendance for the fall term of 1937 was 33.86 and in 1938 it was 35.78. A few children having reached the age of sixteen years or over, were taken out of school as they were needed at home, and one school girl of 17 was married. So the charge of a decrease in attendance does not hold. In fact, if certain children had not gone trapping with their parents there would have been an increase over 1937.\n\nWe have never had a teacher at Hazelton who has done better work or has been held in higher esteem than Mr. Burling, who is splendidly backed by Mrs. Burling.\n\nWhen Capt. Barry visited Hazelton he was suffering from a heavy cold. The weather was bad and his report, I am sure, was seriously affected by these facts.\n\nAgain it appears that the Indian Agent, Capt. Mortimer, would like to see Mr. Burling removed. In connection with this I venture to affirm that the Agent entirely misunderstands the conditions upon which he bases his opinion. This, I am convinced, would be agreed to by the great majority of...\nOttawa,\nJanuary 7, 1939.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to Mr. Burling, the present teacher of the Hazelton Indian day school. Before making the decision conveyed to you in my letter of the 8th ultimo very careful consideration had been given to the reports which had reached us.\n\nIn addition to Inspector Barry's report in which he definitely stated that Mr. Burling's work was unsatisfactory the Indian Agent has expressed the opinion that for some reason or other Mr. Burling does not possess the confidence of the Indians and as a result the Indian parents feel that their children are wasting their time in school.\n\nTaking everything into consideration it is felt that the retention of Mr. Burling's services after the end of June next would not be fair either to the Departmental interests on the Hazelton Reserve or to Mr. Burling himself. I, therefore, trust that you will nominate a qualified teacher to replace Mr. Burling for the academic year 1939-40.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt. Rev. G.A. Rix, D.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nNatives Urge Missionary Be Retained\n\nHAZELTON, Jan. 28.\u2014A meeting of members of the Church Army called to discuss the possibility of Rev. Frank Burling being forced to leave because of reports received from the Inspector of Indian Schools and the Indian Agent. Mr. Burling was present and explained the situation. Leaders among the natives spoke, extolling the work of the teacher and declaring that the children had attended well and had made rapid advances in their work under him.\n\nIt is understood that the matter is being taken up further with the authorities with a view to have Mr. Burling remain.\nDear Sir,\n\nre - Hazelton Indian Day School Teacher.\n\nI am enclosing the \"Daily News\" of Prince Rupert, B.C. dated January 28th, 1939, in which an article appears presumably written by the Rev. Frank Burling, teacher of the Indian Day School at Hazelton.\n\nApparently Mr. Burling received a letter from the Rt. Rev. Bishop Rix informing him of the nature of School Inspector Barry's report on his school recommending his removal. No doubt this raised the ire of Mr. Burling who informed the Indians attending a Church Army meeting of the contents of that letter, resulting in a lot of discontent amongst the Indians of the Hazelton Band.\n\nIf Mr. Burling submitted this article to the Paper for publication, may I suggest he be severely censured for his action.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"G. C. Mortimer\"\n\nGCM/SM.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nD. M. MacKay, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith a copy of a letter received from Capt. Mortimer together with a clipping from the Prince Rupert \"Daily News\", which may have been inspired by Mr. Burling, for the information of the Department.\n\nThe Department will recall that Inspector Barry in his report covering his inspection of the Hazelton Indian Day School on October 13th, last, recommended that Mr. Burling be replaced by a properly qualified teacher as from September, 1939. This recommendation was concurred in by me and was approved by the Department. The Department notified Capt. Mortimer on December 8th, file 151-9-1, that it had been decided to make a change in the teaching services at the Hazelton Indian Day School for the academic year 1939-40 and that Rt. Rev. G.A. Rix, D.D., was being requested to nominate a qualified teacher to take charge of the school on September 1st, 1939.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl\nDM/AC\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 16, 1939.\n\nRe - Hazelton Indian Day School Teacher\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 6th instant and also copy of a letter received by you from Indian Agent Mortimer, enclosed therewith.\n\nIt has occurred to us that it would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to prove that Mr. Burling submitted the article to which Mr. Mortimer refers to the Press for publication. Our experience has been that the Press steadfastly refuse to divulge the source from which such information is secured. However, if you consider it advisable, you might communicate with Mr. Burling and point out to him the inadvisability of either organizing indignation meetings on the one hand or giving publicity to such meetings on the other. The better way perhaps would be to have Inspector Barry discuss the matter with Bishop Rix.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B. C.,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nEducational Branch,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nAfter I received your last letter re the Hazelton School I determined I would say no more about it. But recently there are developments there which urge me to again write you.\n\nWhen the natives heard that there was the probability of Mr. Burling being removed, they were up in arms and held indignation meetings. They had two meetings, at the second of which they passed unanimously resolutions declaring their entire satisfaction with Mr. Burling as a teacher and citizen.\n\nI got to know of this through the Editor of a Prince Rupert paper to whom they had sent a long communication signed by the Chief native of Hazelton. It contained a great deal of adverse criticism of the Indian Agent, going back over several years, which I advised the Editor not to publish as it was extremely personal and most of it out of date. However, he did publish the enclosed, which will show you that some of the things of which you were informed were not accurate. When you read this I hope you will reconsider the dismissal of Mr. Burling, of whom I can confidently say he is an outstanding teacher and an altogether good man.\n\nThe meetings held by the natives and the resolutions passed, I had nothing to do with. They were of their own volition.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG. A. Rix.\nOttawa, February 18, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a letter received by the Department from Right Reverend G. A. Rix, Bishop of Caledonia. This letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nI have been wondering if it would be possible for you to review again the conditions existing at Hazelton and the work of the teacher during the last year. I should like to know also if it would be advisable to transfer this teacher to another Anglican school that may be available in British Columbia. I have promised the Bishop that the matter was being referred to you for consideration and that no action would be taken until I had your recommendations before me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hogy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nEncl.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, February 18, 1939.\n\nMy dear Bishop Rix:\n\nI have for acknowledgment Your Lordship's letter of the 13th instant and also newspaper clipping relating to conditions at the Hazelton Indian Day School, enclosed therewith.\n\nIn the newspaper clipping it is stated that the children have attended well and made rapid progress, while on the other hand in the Inspector's report it is stated that the attendance has been most irregular and that the teacher himself attributes his non-success to this fact. You can readily appreciate, therefore, how difficult it is to reach a decision here that will be fair and equitable to the parties concerned. The monthly attendance returns have not been sent in regularly by this particular teacher. In the month of June last year, with an enrolment of 48 pupils, the average attendance was 19; in March 23; and in December 35.\n\nI am asking Major MacKay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, to review conditions at Hazelton again and to let me have a definite recommendation. Just as soon as I hear from the Commissioner I shall be glad to communicate with you again.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Reverend G. A. Rix, D.D.,\nBishop of Caledonia,\nPrince Rupert, B. C.\nR. H. Haig\nEducational Branch\nIndian Department\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter much deliberation I have decided to write in protest against the reports of Inspector Barry & Mr. Mortimer, the Indian Agent, on my work and influence among the natives of Hazelton.\n\nIn the two previous terms, school work was seriously hampered by epidemics\u2014diphtheria, measles, whooping cough. The last continued all August also among white children in town.\n\nWhen the Inspector visited, many of those present had only just returned after three months absence; coupled with the broken attendance of preceding terms, the backwardness of pupils was not to be wondered at.\n\nMy methods of teaching over a long period of years have invariably met with success. Twice returning to Canada after the war I have had charge of schools ranging from rural (one-roomed), to town high schools. I have taught various nationalities & amongst the non-English, my methods have increased the attendance three-fold.\n\nWhen here, the Inspector took the beginners' class in reading,\nbut only succeeded in frightening them into speechlessness.\n\nHe then resorted to calling older brothers or sisters from other classes to stand with them. Were I to adopt such methods, the work of the school would be disorganized.\n\nI object strongly to the sarcastic asides in which he indulges; such tactics are subversive to school discipline. Other teachers have spoken to me on this matter.\n\nShortly after his visit an outside teacher called. He complimented me on the appearance of the school, and the quality of pupils' work shown round the walls. I do not give his name for obvious reasons.\n\nInspector Barry said he had not seen the Agent, but during the afternoon he charged me with excluding pupils of fifteen years. This I strongly repudiated, & asked the name of his informant. It was the Agent. He also hinted that the Agent & I were not on good terms. This was astounding to me, as I have not had more than three conversations with the Agent since my arrival in Sept. 57.\n\nFrom the registers of past years it appears that this school has had frequent changes of teachers; surely something must be wrong when there is no continuity of tenure; it is certain that no school can make progress under such conditions.\n\nRegarding the Agent's report, I can state most emphatically that his criticism is entirely erroneous. The attitude of the natives is most friendly & the Native Brotherhood is solid on my behalf. It is the Agent who has not the respect of the natives.\n\nPlease pardon this somewhat lengthy letter but I feel sure you will allow me to state my case.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFrank Burling.\nOttawa, February 25, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith for your information a letter received by the Department from Mr. Frank Burling, teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nI have already acknowledged receipt of this communication and intimated to Mr. Burling that the correspondence relating to the operation of the Hazelton school was being sent forward to you for your guidance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP. O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B. C.\nOttawa, February 25, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th instant and to state by way of comment that I have sent forward to Commissioner MacKay all the correspondence that has reached here with respect to the operation of the Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nYou can readily appreciate how difficult it is for the officials here to reach a decision, in view of the many conflicting reports that have come to us. In the Indian service it is almost inevitable that we should in these matters be guided from time to time by the reports and the recommendations of our own officials. These men are in close contact with actual conditions, have had years of experience in the work and are, in the opinion of the Government, capable and efficient administrators.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nFrank Burling, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nIndian Day School,\nBox 776, Hazelton, B. C.\nMarch 20, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe Your File 151-9-1.\n\nOn receipt of your letter of February 18th, conditions existing at the Hazelton Indian Day School, with particular reference to the retention of Mr. Burling's services as teacher, were again reviewed with Inspector Barry. It is considered that nothing would be gained by inspecting the school again until November of this year or April of the coming year. It would not be a good move to transfer Mr. Burling to another school in this Province. If this teacher is to continue in the service of the Department it is felt he should do so at Hazelton and be given an opportunity until the school is again inspected to improve the standing of the various grades and follow the instructions given by the Inspector. This arrangement meets with the approval of Capt. Barry and in view of all the circumstances involved, might be acceptable to the Department. No doubt the Department will advise Capt. Mortimer and the Rt. Rev. Bishop Rix in due course of the decision made.\n\nA copy of Capt. Barry's letter to me regarding the matter is attached for your information.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nP.O.Box 444  \nVancouver, B.C.\n\nMarch 1, 1939.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,  \nIndian Commissioner,  \nP.O.Box 70,  \nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:-\n\nI have read Departmental letter 151-9-1 dated February 18th 1939 with regard to the conditions existing at the Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nMy report on this school dated October 16th 1938 sets out the conditions in considerable detail. It is not possible for me to visit this school again during the present academic year without great interference in the inspection work of schools not as yet visited. Further as I have little hope that there has been any great improvement at Hazelton, I believe that it is in the interests of the Department that I refrain from visiting that school till such time as I must carry out an inspection in the academic year 1939-40, probably either in October 1939 or April 1940.\n\nMay I say that without in any way withdrawing anything I may have reported in a professional way with regard to the school or Mr Burling's work, I particularly wish to cooperate with Mr Hoey and Mr Phelan in the general administration policy. If it is felt by the Department that for various reasons it would be better to give way to the Anglican Bishop and retain Mr Burling as teacher for one more year I am perfectly willing to refrain from making any observation which might embarrass the Department. In all such cases my wish is that the Superintendent of Welfare and Training should know the exact conditions that exist, and in this case I am perfectly certain that the poor conditions at Hazelton are perfectly well understood. The people that object to the removal of Mr Burling are only a very small percentage of the Indians, and outside the Indian Agent's reports and my own there is nothing to show that the Catholic and Salvation Army children outnumber the Anglican in Hazelton.\n\nMay I suggest that Mr Burling be informed that if permitted to remain another year at Hazelton he simply must follow the instructions given to him by the Inspector of Indian Schools and improve the standing of the various Grades in his school. I believe that he should be further informed that the Department does not approve of meetings of protest in regard to criticism of policy or officials, and that his further retention will depend entirely on the reports received from the Indian Agent and Inspector of Schools.\nSeveral reasons prompt me to give this advice. In particular it may not be possible to erect a new two-room Indian Day School at Hazelton during the 1939-40 fiscal year. Should such a school be erected it is to be hoped that it will not be placed under Anglican auspices, but I quite realize that the present may not be a very suitable time to make a general decision with regard to the future policy in respect to the possible non employment of Missionaries as teachers in our schools.\n\nIn conclusion may I again say that I am only anxious that the real facts should be known in Ottawa. Mr Hoey may rest assured that I have no intention of making any report that might prove embarrassing.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nGerald H. Barry,\nInspector of Indian Schools, B.C.\nOttawa, March 25, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I refer to a letter received by the Department from you, dated February 7, 1939. This letter, together with a communication received from His Lordship Bishop Nix and dated February 13, was sent forward to Major MacKay, Indian Commissioner, British Columbia, for any comments he might care to offer.\n\nWhen I sent forward these letters to the Commissioner, it was my hope that he would be in a position to have Inspector Barry make a special inspection of the Hazelton school and again report to the Department on your work.\n\nMajor MacKay informs me that it is not possible for Inspector Barry to visit Hazelton at this time without great interference in the inspection work of a number of schools not yet visited by the Inspector this year. In view of this fact, you may continue in charge of the Hazelton School, if you so desire, during the academic year 1939-40. If you decide to remain, however, it must be on the distinct understanding that you are willing to follow the instructions given you from time to time by the Inspector of Indian Schools and that, in addition to this, you are prepared to put forth a determined effort to improve the standing of the various grades in your school. May I state, also, that the Department does not approve of meetings of protest by Indians, at which meetings the policy of the Department and departmental officials is usually criticised and criticised unfairly. I am aware, of course, that it may not be within your power to prevent such meetings. I am simply emphasising the point that you should not be associated in any way with such gatherings.\n\nInspector Barry will visit Hazelton and inspect your work early in the new academic year. When his report covering the inspection of your school at that time reaches the Department, a definite decision will be reached with respect to the continuance of your services at the Hazelton school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

He was formerly teacher of the Gitlakdamix Indian Day School. I think you will find that the Department decided Mr. Kinley was not to be appointed as a teacher of any Indian Day School. He is not a trained teacher as you know, and was, in my opinion, a complete failure at Gitlakdamix, from which position the Department eventually removed him.\n\nReverend B. Sherman is now really too old for teaching work. I am not certain of his exact age but believe it to be about sixty-five. It is mentioned in my reports on the Kitkatla school. Should Mr. Sherman desire to go to Metlakatla, he would, I think, be quite a success there, at least for a year or two.\n\nIn general, I would not recommend for the coming academic year the appointment of any teacher who did not hold a professional certificate of some sort given as the result of normal school training.\n\nWith reference to the second last paragraph of Bishop Rix's letter, I may say that I am not aware of the circumstances leading up to the removal of the teacher from the Metlakatla Indian Day School. I do not, however, recommend the appointment of a teacher in an Indian Day School who has already been removed by the Department from a similar position in another school.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of Bishop Rix's letter, it would appear to me that the salaries at present paid by the Department for teachers holding first-class provincial\nD.M. MacKay\n\nJuly 3rd, 1942.\n\nCertificates are quite as good, if not better, than salaries paid by rural school boards to teachers doing similar work under the B.C.

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nSome time ago the Rt. Rev. G. Rix, D.D., Bishop of Caledonia, stated that he had difficulty in finding qualified teachers for vacant positions in Indian Day Schools in the Diocese of Caledonia. Bishop Rix asked me to recommend to the Department teachers to fill the vacancies in his diocese provided that I was satisfied with their qualifications and that they were Protestant.\n\nMiss Isabel Margaret Faithfull, aged fifty-seven, a communicant member of the Anglican Church, at present living at 4819 Lanark Street, Vancouver, B.C., has today visited this office. Miss Faithful was trained at the Saskatoon Normal School and holds a Second Class Alberta Certificate. She taught in Provincial schools in that Province for some ten years and later in Indian schools for over eleven years. During this time she has been eight years at Little Pine Indian Day School, Battleford Agency, and three years at Shoal Lake Indian Day School, Pas Agency.\n\nInspector Barry informs me that he considers Miss Faithfull's recommendations as received from Provincial inspectors very good indeed and he considers that she would be quite successful as teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School which is,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nof course, in the Babine Agency and the Diocese of Caledonia.\n\nI have had a short interview with Miss Faithfull and agree with Inspector Barry that this teacher should prove successful at Hazelton and I would recommend that she be appointed teacher of that school as from January 1, 1942.\n\nThe Department's decision by air mail is requested and I should be glad to know what salary Miss Faithfull will be allowed should my recommendation be accepted.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of Departmental letter 151-9-1 of November 25th last with reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply to the above letter, I may say that in my letter 15/1/5370 of December 1st I forwarded to the Department by air mail a recommendation for the appointment of Miss Faithfull as teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School and as Miss Faithfull is a communicant member of the Anglican Church the school will no doubt be continued under the auspices of that church for the present should the Department accept my recommendation for this teacher's appointment.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M.

He also states that children of school age at Hazelton amount to fifty-one, made up of thirty-five Anglicans, fourteen Salvation Army and two Roman Catholics. In view of this Mr. Mallinson suggests that if the Anglican Church is unable to nominate a teacher at this time, the Department should appoint a qualified person to take charge of the school which presumably would be undenominational, under such circumstances.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor D.M.

Mallinson,\nIndian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\nOttawa,\nMay 14, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 7th instant I note your remarks regarding the conduct of the Indian children.\n\nBefore writing to the Agent in regard to this matter it has occurred to me that the possible solution would be for the Church to provide wholesome entertainment for these children. This would likely prevent them from visiting the cafes and keep them off the streets. Our experience in dealing with Indians shows that a mere negative attitude does not obtain the desired results.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Frank Burling,\nTeacher,\nIndian Day School,\nHazelton, B.C.\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nFederal Building,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have written to Miss Jenner asking if she will take charge of the Indian School at Hazelton. If I have a favourable answer from her I will at once notify you.\n\nI am sorry that Mrs. Henderson has left Aiyansh. In case no one else turns up for this school we should fall back on Mr. Kinley, who did at least passable work there in the Fall.\n\nI have informed Mr. Shearman of Kitkatla that I would recommend him for Metlakatla. He has decided that he cannot carry on the heavy school at Kitkatla. I understand the Metlakatla school is much lighter. I herewith recommend this change. This leaves Kitkatla, Greenville and Kitwancool definitely vacant. I am writing to a man today who might take Kitkatla. I am not sure if he has teachers' qualifications, but in these days we cannot afford to be too particular.\n\nI regret that the teacher from Metlakatla was removed. She was well liked by the people and the pupils, but the Indian Agent found her lacking in discipline. If you could get in touch with her she might consider working in some other of our schools and from the first insist upon discipline.\n\nI feel that if the Department does not make the Indian teachers prospect more attractive they will not be able to fill the schools.\n\nyours faithfully,\n\nG.

MacKay, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nre- Hazelton Indian Day School\n\nReplying to your letter of June 22, I wish to advise that the attendance at this school has been very irregular mainly due to sickness, there having been epidemics of 'flu, mumps and measles during the year. However, some pupils have attended irregularly due to their families having moved away for indefinite periods on account of employment. For example, several families proceed to the canneries early in May to fish for spring salmon. Employment in war industries etc. has claimed others, whilst some trappers take the family with them.\n\nThe school building, owned by the Anglican Church, is just the same as it has been for a long period of years and, no doubt, would have been vacated in favour of a new school but for the war.\n\nSports days have been held in about every village sometime in May for years, and it is the practice of the teachers to mark the registers and dismiss the children on such occasions. Probably, in this case, no children attended on the afternoon in question. Children from other reserves attend with their parents, taking the whole day off.\n\nI do not think the Rev. Frank Burling enjoys good enough health to carry on as a teacher. He informed me last fall that he only accepted the position to accommodate Bishop Rix.\n\nS.

(RG 10, Volume 6392, File 814-1, part 2)\nOttawa,\nJuly 22, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, in which you advise that Miss Jenner has resigned as teacher of the Kitwanebol Indian Day School and that Bishop Rix intends to offer her appointment as teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School for the academic year 1942-43.\n\nPlease advise me as soon as possible if Miss Jenner accepts this appointment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith letter received from Bishop Rix advising of the nomination of Miss Jenner, who has resigned as teacher of the Indian Day School at Kitwancool, to the Indian Day School at Hazelton. If Miss Jenner accepts the nomination the Department will be advised further.\n\nRegarding the proposal to nominate the Reverend Kinley as teacher at Gitlakdamix in place of Mrs. Henderson who has resigned, I would advise that I am not favourable to this man's appointment as his work is not considered satisfactory.\n\nI have no objection to the nomination of Mr. Shearman from Kitkatla Indian Day School to Metlakatla Day School, as the former school is too isolated for his advancing age, and I would recommend approval of same.\n\nIt is hoped to secure teachers for the other vacancies mentioned by His Grace and nominations will be forwarded in due course.\n\nI enclose Mr. Inspector Barry's letter of the 3rd instant in this connection.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJames Colman\n\nFor D.M.

I am now able to say that for Hazelton I have secured a most suitable teacher, a Mrs. E. V. Bird. Her present address is Savoy Apartments, 749 McClure St., Victoria. She has a first class Saskatchewan teacher's certificate, and has had a good deal of experience in Indian teaching. She will be able to take over on Feb. 1st next. Will you be good enough to pass on her recommended name to the department. She is too good a person to lose. It is a poor time to start a school, but she is the sort of teacher who would make valuable use of the time, and would be on hand for the autumn term of '44.\n\nI have heard of no one for the school at Massett. I hope you may be able to suggest one.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG.A. Rix.\nOttawa,\nDecember 28, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nEX'D.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O.

Rix and from Mrs. Katherine S.S. Bird, Teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nIn talking the matter over with Mrs. Bird during the Christmas holidays it was decided to try out a method to cope with the number of pupils attending this school. For over two months now Mrs. Bird has taught grades 3-7 each morning and grades 1-2 each afternoon. This has been quite successful and each grade has really accomplished quite as much as previously when all classes were in school the entire day. Mrs. Bird informs me she has an attendance of over 20 both in the forenoon and afternoon.\n\nThe pupils of this school only stay away on account of sickness or on account of some other valid excuse. Mrs. Bird's personality has an attraction for the scholars and they attend quite regularly.\n\nAccording to my records there are 35 boys and 41 girls of school age belonging to this reserve but, so many families are away I have no knowledge as to the number of those not residing here. However, I think every child on the reserve at the present time is attending school.\n\nThe month of May usually shows a decrease in attendance which becomes very marked in June. September also has a below average attendance. A large number of families are at the canneries during these three months which lowers the attendance considerably. The average attendance for 1944 is as follows:\n\nFebruary - 30.1  March - 32.9  April - 39.5\nMay - 26.5       June - 18.4   Sept. - 23.03\n\np.t.o.\nHazelton, B.C., April 3rd, 1946\n\nMARCH QUARTER REPORT\n\nThe Hazelton Indian Day school was reopened on February 15th 1946.

(RG 10, Volume 6392, File 814-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n8. Dependents. Taxpayers may claim as dependents only\u2014\n\n(1) Any person under eighteen years of age and wholly dependent on the taxpayer for support and of whom the taxpayer has in law or in fact the custody and control.\n\n(2) Sons and daughters (including illegitimate sons and daughters) or sons-in-law or daughters-in-law, brothers and sisters or brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law, and grandchildren, if under eighteen years of age, or under twenty-one and attending school, or over eighteen years of age and incapable of self-support.\n\n(3) Parents, grandparents, parents-in-law, or grandparents-in-law, incapable of self-support.\n\nEmployees claiming dependents other than their own children are advised to read Item 16 below.\n\n9. \"Self-contained Domestic Establishment\" means a dwelling house, apartment or other similar place of abode occupied at all times by persons in which residence amongst other things the taxpayer as a general rule sleeps and has his meals prepared and served. (See Item 17.)\n\n10. Effect of Failure to File Form T.D.1 (Revised January 1946) in cases where Form T.D.1 (Revised January 1946) is not completed and filed with the employer, deductions from all salaries or wages paid on or after January 1st, 1946, must be made as if the employee were a single person without dependents. However, the employee may have filed a previous Form T.D.1. Single persons without dependents need not file this form.\n\n11. Change in Status or Dependents. If during the year there is any change in the status or dependents of an employee, the employee must complete and file with his employer an amended Form T.D.1. A change in the monthly Family Allowance cheque should not call for an amended T.D.1 Form unless the amount is increased by $1.00 per month. See Item 19 for information regarding effect of changes on deductions during the currency of the year.\n\n12. If Employee Has More Than One Employer, it will be necessary to complete and file Form T.D.1 with each employer, to claim married status or dependents.\n\n13. Filing of Income Tax Return. In addition to filing this form you must file your Income Tax Return Form T.1 Special or T.1 General for the calendar year on or before 30th April of the following year.\n\n14. Family Allowances rates\u2014\n\nFor each child under 6 years of age, $5.00 per month For each child 6 or over but under 10, $6.00 per month For each child 10 or over but under 13, $7.00 per month For each child 13 or over but under 16, $8.00 per month Less reductions in monthly allowances\u2014 For the fifth child\u2014$1. For the sixth and seventh child\u2014$2 each For the eighth and each additional child\u2014$3 each\n\nINSTRUCTIONS TO THE EMPLOYER\n\n15. If Form T.D.1 (Revised January 1946) Not Filed By Employee. Any employee who fails to file a completed Form T.D.1 (Revised January 1946) must be regarded for tax deduction purposes as a single person without dependents.\n\n16. Employer to Disallow Claims for Excessive Number of Dependents. To be entitled to the full tax credits for a dependent other than the taxpayer's own child(ren) or grandchild(ren) (or children as defined in Item 8 (1) above), a taxpayer must declare at least $400 per annum to the support of such dependent. Many persons are unaware of this limitation. For tax deduction purposes, employers will be instructed to reduce the salary or wage of any employee claiming more than two such dependents in Item 5 as if the employee had only two dependents in addition to his own child(ren) or grandchild(ren) (or children as defined in Item 8 (1) above). The employer will notify the employee that he must submit proof of any claim for more dependents to the District Inspector of Income Tax. If the employee proves to the satisfaction of the Inspector that he has entitled to further allowances, the employer will be advised accordingly.\n\n17. Employer to Scrutinize Claims by Single Persons for Married Status. The definition of a \"Self-contained Domestic Establishment\" contained in Item 9 indicates clearly that a taxpayer is not entitled to claim Married Status as a reason of supporting a dependent therein unless the dependent actually resides with the taxpayer. Therefore, employers are instructed to examine addresses shown under Items 4 (F) with the taxpayer's own address in Item 2 (which should show where he is actually living at the time of making the declaration) and in every case where the addresses are not the same, the employer shall make deductions as if the taxpayer were a single person, with or without dependents as the case may be.\n\n18. Employer's Responsibility Regarding Form T.D.1. The employer will have regard to the instructions contained in Items 10 and 17 above and will otherwise make certain that the form is fully completed. If any employee shows children under 16 years of age as dependents under Items 4 or 5, he must also complete Item 6 or the employer shall not take account of such dependents under 16 years of age for tax deduction purposes. He will also delete as a dependent under Item 5 the name of any person whom the employee has already listed in Item 4 unless the claim for married status came within the previous (C) period. If the employer chooses to believe that any of the information on this form is incorrect or false, he will not act upon the declaration until the employee has made the appropriate confirmation or correction. In case of doubt, the matter should be referred to the District Inspector of Income Tax.\n\n19. Action upon Receipt of Amended Form T.D.1 during Currency of Year. Employees are required to file an amended Form T.D.1 if any change occurs in status or dependents. The employer must give immediate effect to a change from \"Single\" status to \"Married\" status due to an increase in the number of dependents and to any substantial change (i.e. in excess of $1.00 per month) in Family Allowance cheques. A change from \"Married\" status to \"Single\" status (e.g. where the employee becomes a widower) should not be made effective until the first pay period in the next calendar year because the employee will still be classified as single (\"Married\") status for the whole of the calendar year in which the change took place. Similarly, a decrease in the number of dependents should not generally require a change in the deduction until the following calendar year, with one important exception due to the provision that a taxpayer may not claim as a dependent any person who has an income in excess of $400 during the calendar year. If, for example, a son who was previously supported by the employee and was claimed as a dependent on Form T.D.1 takes up employment from which he will earn over $400 during the calendar year, immediate effect should be given to the amended Form T.D.1 as otherwise the employee will be left with a substantial balance of tax to pay with his return on Form T.1 Special or T.1 General.\n\n20. Further Information or Forms with respect to deduction of tax may be obtained from any District Inspector of Income Tax.\n\n21. Completed Forms T.D.1 must be Kept on File by the employer in order that they may be available at all times for payroll inspection by officers of Taxation Division.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If Form T.D.1 (Revised January 1946). Not Filed By Employee. Any employee who fails to file a completed Form T.D.1. (Revised January 1946) must be regarded for tax deduction purposes as a single person without dependents.\n\n16. Employer to Disallow Claims for Excessive Number of Dependents. To be entitled to the full tax credits for a dependent other than the taxpayer's own children or grandchildren (or children as defined in Item 8 (1) above), a tax-payer must contribute at least $400 per year to the support of such dependent. Many persons are unaware of this limitation. For tax deduction purposes, employers will make deductions from the salary or wage of any employee claiming more than two such dependents. If however, the employee had not two dependents in addition to his own children or grand-children (or children as defined in Item 8 (1) above). The employer will notify the employee that he must submit proof of any claim for more dependents to the District Inspector of Income Tax. If the employee proves to the satisfaction of the Inspector that he is entitled to further allowances, the employer will be advised accordingly.\n\n17. Employer to Scrutinize Claims by Single Persons for Married Status. The definition of \"Self-contained Domestic Establishment\" contained in Item 9 indicates clearly that a taxpayer is not entitled to claim Married Status by reason of supporting a dependent therein unless the dependent actually resides with the taxpayer therein. Therefore employers must check the address shown under Item 4(C) or 4(E) with the taxpayer's own address in Item 2 (which should show where he is actually living at the time of making the declaration) and in no case where the addresses are not the same the employer must make deductions as if the taxpayer were a single person, with or without dependents as the case may be.\n\n18.

Rent of the building at the rate of $60.00 per annum.\n\nIt is noted from the last paragraph of your letter that you will write again regarding the proposed appointment of Adjutant Rendall as teacher.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing Mr. Indian Agent Boys' letter of October 28th and enclosure referred to therein, together with lists of the school age and pre-school age children on the Hazelton Indian Reserve. It will be noted from the information provided that it is imperative that we open a second classroom on this reserve to accommodate over 30 children in grades 2 to 5 inclusive, presently enrolled at the school, leaving the 34 children in grade 1 in the present classroom.\n\nThe Church Army Hall, property of the band, is available for use as a second classroom at a rental of $60.00 per annum and an expenditure of approximately $450.00 for material and labour will be necessary to make it suitable for our purpose. Desks and other furnishings, including blackboards will cost approximately $400.00, and it would be appreciated if these expenditures could be approved, if funds are available for this purpose.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Boys refers to Adjutant Rendall, the Salvation Army Officer at Hazelton, who has agreed to accept the position as teacher of the second classroom. I have been in communication with Bishop Gibson regarding the appointment of a Salvation Army official as teacher on a reserve which was formerly considered as an Anglican Mission Field, his letter of November 7th in this connection being enclosed. Adjutant Rendall's services will be available if and when required and a recommendation will be made with regard to his appointment and salary when departmental approval has been obtained for opening the second classroom and carrying out the necessary improvements and purchases.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nenclos.\nDear Major MacKay,\n\nReplying to your letter 1-11-3 of last month I would be happy to nominate Adjutant Randall for the position of teacher in the Indian Day School at Hazelton provided it is understood that the prerogative of nominating the teacher continues to be the privilege of the Anglican Church in that village.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nJ.B. Gibson,\nBishop of Caledonia.\nWith reference to your 1-11-3 of Oct 11th regarding the opening of a second classroom at Hazelton, I have discussed this matter further with Brigadier Willingham and it appears that Adjutant Kendall has agreed to teach if necessary. Enrollment at Hazelton at present is as follows:\n\n| Grade | Enrolled |\n|-------|----------|\n| Grade 1 | 24       |\n| Grade 2 | 12       |\n| Grade 3 | 5        |\n| Grade 4 | 2        |\n| Grade 5 | 2        |\n\nI would recommend that Mrs. Massey be left with all Grade 1, and the remainder placed under Adjutant Kendall, if a suitable building can be prepared.\n\nThe Council of Hazelton Band is quite willing to give us use of the Church Army Hall at a rental of $60.00 per annum, but because the councillors are scattered at present, I have not been able to complete a resolution. This will be sent forward in a few days.\n\nThe Church Army Hall is in poor repair and most of the windows have been broken as a result of vandalism. It is proposed to build a partition across the south end, shutting off the back 20 ft., re-locate the stove, repair the outside walls and bath with earth to floor level, build outside toilets and paint the inside with a casein paint. Also build cupboards.\n\nThe only available carpenter is a white man, Mr. Reynolds, who could be assisted by Indian Frank having a useful rough carpenter. Attached hereto is an estimate of cost of repairing and furnishing this old building.\n\nIt is not possible to obtain the necessary Vancouver Board nor the nails locally, and if these cannot be procured elsewhere (over)\n**QUOTATION ONLY:**\n\n| Item Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price

M. & R., OTTAWA, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of July 23rd, your file 15-9-1(1) regarding copies of the bulletin for the teacher of Hazelton Indian School No. 2. I note that you have no further copies of the earlier issues of the bulletin and suggest that Mr. Rendell should avail himself of Mrs. Massey's copies. This is not a satisfactory arrangement because Mr. Rendell will wish to make use of the bulletin as a reference and will also require the requisition form on the back page of one of the copies. No doubt, at the commencement of the new term you will receive a number of similar requests from this and other Agencies where teachers have been found for schools that were not opened last year. There are three such schools in this Agency and I would ask that consideration be given to printing some additional copies of the bulletin.\n\nJ.V. Boys,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 23rd, 1947,\n\nMr. J.V. Boys, Indian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, it is regretted that the Bulletin has not been forwarded to Mr. Rendell. We have no copies of previous issues of the Bulletin that we can send him. No doubt he can review the copies sent to Mrs. Massy.\n\nWe will place his name on our mailing list for the coming academic year.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nIt would appear that some divisions of your office are unaware that a second school was opened on the Hazelton Indian Reserve No. 1 last winter. Correspondence and circulars come in single copies and addressed merely to the teacher, Hazelton Indian Day School. The original school was divided last winter and the Junior grades left with Mrs. J. Massy, whose school has been designated Hazelton Indian Day School No. 1 whilst the senior pupils were housed in another building under the direction of Mr. C. Rendell. Mr. Rendell has not been receiving the school bulleting and it would be appreciated if a copy of each bulletin might be mailed to him at your earliest convenience. These should be addressed to Mr. C. Rendell, Hazelton Indian School #2, Hazelton, B.C.\nOttawa, January 30, 1947.\n\nMemorandum\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Hazelton Indian Day School, No. 814\n\nMr. Clarence Rendell has been appointed as teacher of the second classroom at this school, at a salary of $131.00 a teaching month effective January 13, 1947.\n\nEnclosed are Staff questionnaire and T.D.I forms together with Statutory Declaration outlining the reasons for his being unable to secure Family Allowance for his children.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\n\nRgd.\nAirmail\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of January 6th, I am enclosing Questionnaire, T.D. 1 and Statutory Declaration Forms completed by Mr. Clarence Rendell in connection with his appointment as teacher of the second classroom at the Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Rendell apparently has not been in residence in Canada for a period of one year and consequently his children are not eligible for Family Allowance. T.D. 1 form has been completed accordingly, and I trust, will be acceptable.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Rendell assumed his duties on January 13th.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nencls.\nQUARTERLY REPORT\nBABINE INDIAN AGENCY\nENDING DECEMBER 31st\n1946.\n\nEducation\n\nThe need here, when material and funds are available, is a three, possibly four roomed school at Hazelton, with quarters, on a strictly undenominational basis and taking in Hagwilget the staff to include one Catholic teacher in order to avoid religious repercussions as sectarian division of feeling seems to run higher here among the three main divisions of the churches than elsewhere in the Province. In any event, the Hagwilget school alongside the main highway, is a disgrace.\n\n(Signed) James Coleman\ninspector of indian Agencies\nQUARTERLY REPORT\nBABINE INDIAN AGENCY\nending December 31st\n1946.\n\nEducation We are most fortunate in having Mrs. Massey at Hazelton where she has been good naturedly handling much too large a class without complaint, but the new class room is just about ready to open and should be in operation by the 13th of January with some improvisation of desks and seats pending arrival of new ones, although the appointment of a teacher has not yet been made, due to the local applicant's tardiness in the matter. It is expected that this will help to remove a great deal of the local discontent with our educational set-up.\n\n(Signed) James Coleman\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nOttawa, 6 January 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKey, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, we approve the appointment of Clarence Rendall as the second teacher at the Hazelton Indian Day School.\n\nSalary will be allowed him at the rate of $131.00 a teaching month. He should forward T.D. 1 Form and Staff Questionnaire Form as soon as he begins duties.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 151-9-1 (W.T.I)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Neary's letter of November 20th and in particular the last paragraph dealing with the proposed appointment of Adjutant Rendall as teacher of the second classroom at the Hazelton Indian Day School, I am enclosing Inspector Coleman's letter of December 30th and application from Mr. Rendall.\n\nAlterations to the classroom building are being proceeded with and providing we are successful in obtaining desks and other equipment the school should be opened shortly.\n\nThe appointment of Adj. Rendall is recommended at a salary of $131.00 per teaching month.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nHazelton, B.C.\nDecember 30th, 1946.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C. Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI enclose herewith application of Mr. Clarence Rendell for position as teacher for the senior class-room now being prepared for Hazelton Indian Day School. It will be noted that he has taught for twelve years in Newfoundland schools and holds what he considers to be the equivalent of a B.C. 1st class teacher's certificate. He is a Salvation Army Officer.\n\nAnglicans and Salvationists are in about equal numbers on Hazelton Indian Reserve, although Mr. Boys' survey gave the Anglicans a small majority but this was due to rating the Ben McKenzie family as Catholics instead of Salvation Army, in error according to my information.\n\nMrs Jane Massey, who will take the Primary grade, is an Anglican and there would appear to be no valid objection to the appointment of a Protestant of another church, particularly as the Anglican Church was asked by Mr. Boys if they could supply a teacher and they admitted that they were unable. Mr. Rendell is aware, of course, that the school is pretty much on an undenominational basis and there is no room for the intrusion of any institutional bias. It is proposed that he take the senior class in the class-room now being prepared.\n\nAs he has his own quarters I would recommend that he be paid on the same basis as Mrs Massey, that is, $131.00 per month and would recommend approval of his application.\n\n(James Coleman)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nAPPLICATION FOR CLASSIFICATION ON INDIAN SCHOOL TEACHER'S SALARY SCHEDULE\n\nI.
