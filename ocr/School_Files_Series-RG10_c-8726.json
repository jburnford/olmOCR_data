These members of the Board shall, in each other's presence, complete this memorandum, which shall then be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, in one copy.\n\nThe Board of Inquiry shall, if at all practicable assemble within 48 hours of the pupil's death.\n\nThe parents or guardians of the deceased pupil shall be given notice of this inquiry and be permitted to attend it or to send a representative. They or their representative shall be asked if they wish to make a statement. In the event of their so wishing, their statement shall be attached to the report. The inquiry, however, shall not be delayed more than 72 hours after the time at which it would otherwise be held, to enable them to attend it.\n\nIf the Indian Agent is located at such a distance from the school as to make it impracticable for him to attend the Board, he shall request a responsible local resident to act for him. A suitable person for this duty would be a Justice of the Peace or a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted or Provincial Police. A more or less permanent arrangement of this kind might be necessary in some cases. The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this duty, on the Agent's recommendation. The report of the Board, in any case, must reach the Department through the Indian Agent's office.\n\nThis inquiry is not designed to take the place of, or prevent, any other inquiry, including an inquest, which may be required by law.\n\nIf the pupil died as the result of an accident, the Indian Agent is required to take the statements of the witnesses of the accident, and attach them to this memorandum.\n\nForm No. 414.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The average number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return, divided by the number of pupils under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Location]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort William Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended [date].\n\nPrincipal [signature]\n\nDated [date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 10th 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 30th Oct. 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Location], this [Date].\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: B. Ravine\n\nDated: Jan 9th, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Driftville Alta., this 31st Jan., 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Vermilion School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 4, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Driffield, Alta., Oct. 19, 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The annual per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 50 April, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, posting No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct 2nd, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at: [Location]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 463\nReq.

CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Dart Vermilion School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan 3rd, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 4th January, 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 3rd, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 6th January, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pegging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Vermilion Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan 3rd 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 1st January 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days of residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Vermilion Ind. Res. School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 3rd, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Lesser Slave Lake Agency this 11th November 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Vermilion Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence during quarter shown on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils shown on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The quarterly per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort William Indian School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated June 30, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19 ...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReyn No. 2850\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|-----|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| D 172           | Peter Martel   | 16  |     |     | Upper North   |                   |                          |                           | Jan 5/37 | NB.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Vermilion Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Sept. 30 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Vermilion this 30th Sept. 1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.

R. de Grouard\nMcLennan, Alberta\nCanada\n\nMarch 12, 1948.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nReplying to your letter of February 27th, file 151-15-3 (E.1) in regard to December quarter return of the Fort Vermillion Indian Residential School, which has not yet reached you, the Principal advises that this quarterly return was handed to the Indian Agent at Fort Vermillion on January 2nd, but apparently same was misplaced. Consequently, I requested the Principal to send me a copy of this return which I am forwarding to you by air mail.\n\nI note, however, that the report has not been signed by the Indian Agent, but in order to avoid further delay, I am sending it on to you without this signature.\n\nTrusting that this will be satisfactory, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nENCLS.\n\nRev. L. Beuglet, O.M.I.\n\nLE/BL\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Vermilion Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan 2 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Vermilion this Feb 27 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nResp.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Vermilion Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan 2 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Vermilion this Feb 27 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days pupils in residence during quarter as entered in the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Vermilion Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan 2 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Vermilion this Feb 27 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the feet thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Vermilion Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Jan 2 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Vermilion this Feb 27 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Vermilion Rd.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Vermilion Red River School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 30, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: Fort Vermilion\nthis 8th July, 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Vermilion Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 5th 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Vermilion October 5th 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3444\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Fort Vermilion Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Ft.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Ft.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Mt. Vermilion Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 4th 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Vermilion this 10th January 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the 'Average attendance of pupils during quarter' by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Vermilion Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days that pupils in all cases entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Vermilion Ind.

Father Falher is correct in stating that the Department came to the relief of the Qu'Appelle school after a fire, as it practically refurnished the school.\n\nAs Mr. Inspector Conroy is familiar with the district I would suggest that he be asked for a report on this application. The cost of the articles enumerated would be in the neighbourhood of $500.00, exclusive of freight.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6376, file 766-5, part 1)\nSir:\n\nRev. Father Fahler called on me a short time ago and stated that fire had totally destroyed the Indian Boarding school at Fort Vermilion.\n\nHe wished to know if the Department would see it's way clear to give some assistance towards the cost of re-furnishing the school, and submitted a list of articles required for this purpose, (said list herewith turned out).\n\nI would recommend that these articles be provided as shown on list with the addition of 12 dozen pails making one dozen in all, because in my opinion it is very necessary in this instance where there is no up-to-date fire protective service, that there should be filled water-pails distributed throughout the building as a protection against a sudden out-break of fire.\n\nInspector Treaty No. 8.\nOttawa, March 31,, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department having decided to come to the relief of the Fort Vermilion Boarding School, which was destroyed by fire a year ago this month, I have to request that you will be good enough to purchase the following articles and have them forwarded to the Principal of the school at the earliest opportunity:\n\n- 15 bed stands and blankets\n- 15 desks\n- 1 dozen chairs.\n- 1 clock.\n- 1 large table\n- 1 cooking range (large) and utensils\n- 2 large heating stoves\n- 1 dozen pails.\n\nIt might be well, if possible, for you to get in touch with the Principal or Rev. C. Palmer, provincial vicar of Athabasca, Edmonton, and get directions as to how these supplies should be sent. The cost of these articles should be within the neighbourhood of $500.00 and you will be enough to forward to the Department detailed vouchers, if any, for the purchases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, March 31, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 4th of November last, I beg to say that the Department has decided to come to the relief of the Fort Vermilion Boarding School and Mr. Gerald Gard, 740 Seventh Ave., N.W., Edmonton South, has been authorized to purchase the articles asked for in the list forwarded with your letter above referred to and have them forwarded to the Principal at the earliest opportunity. One dozen pairs are being ordered, instead of the half dozen as asked for. Mr. Gard has been informed that it would be well for him to get in touch with either you or the Principal of the school and get directions as to how these supplies should be sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Joseph Habowy,\nO.M.I.\nThe Preston Adjustable Single Ball-Bearing Desk with Book Shelf\n\nMany Schools use the Adjustable Desk exclusively. Pupils of abnormal size can be perfectly fitted in a few minutes. By means of the simple adjustable feature, both the Seat and Desk can be adjusted to the fraction of an inch.\n\nFurnished in three standard sizes as follows:\n\n| No. | Description                        | Complete Desks | Rears | Fronts |\n|-----|------------------------------------|----------------|-------|--------|\n| 1   | Normal or High School, Adults      | $12.50         | $10.00| $10.00 |\n| 2   | ages 10 to 15 years                | $12.00         | $10.00| $10.00 |\n| 3   | ages 5 to 10 years                 | $11.50         | $10.00| $10.00 |\n\nInkwells with all Desks.\n\nThe simplest and best Adjustable Desk made.\nTHE PLATE STEEL DESK\n\nSingle Desk for each Pupil\n\nThe Simplest and Strongest Single Desk made.\n\nSteel standard is used in steel desks because of its metal of drawing quality. It is formed, pressed and drawn into rectangular shape with flanged edges which are welded at intervals. This produces a four-wall (or four-angle) formation which is the strongest standard giving enormous strength and durability.\n\nWhile the purchase price of steel desks is a trifle higher than the difference between steel and iron, the saving in maintenance and the longer life of the desk cost is amply justified. It is an investment which will produce dividends\u2014it's insurance\u2014it's a guarantee of permanence.\n\nWe know that steel is used extensively in the construction of buildings, bridges, ships, railroads, cars and hundreds of other things where iron could not possibly serve the purpose.

(RG 10, Volume 6376, file 766-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nFort Vermilion, June 16th, 1951.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Supt General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Doctor Scott:\n\nR.T. Ferrier will probably bring before you a few items which I have mentioned to him in a few letters which I have sent yesterday by the boat. This time, I wish to entertain you personally about the school of Fort Vermilion where I am presently and which I have thoroughly visited yesterday.\n\nSome time ago, the Principal of this institution had requested me to present before you his urgent demand for the construction of a boys' wing and for other repairs. Being aware of financial circumstances and moreover not being totally conversant with the situation here I did not acquiesce to the Reverend Principal's demand. I believe I was wrong. I therefore came today to ask you if you would allow us to build a wing to provide extra accommodation for our boys. The sleeping, dining and recreation quarters would be sensibly enlarged and the girls' recreation room would also profit by the change. The Department has limited the capacity of the school to 25 children whilst we could easily find perhaps double that number.\n\nA hot air furnace, paint, a couple of sewing machines, two or three washing machines, etc would also be required for the present building, the hot air furnace to replace the worn out one in the class room building and dormitory.\n\nIf the Department was not in a position to help us financially this year would you consider letting me borrow from the Bank an amount set by you and payable at a date also set by you. I insist in the matter because it is urgent and serious. I will leave here on the 22nd and expect to reach Grouard on the 27th inst.\n\nHoping to be favored with a good answer, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVicar Apostolic of Grouard.\nJuly 2, 1931.\n\nDear Bishop Guy:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 16th ultimo, with reference to the urgent need for a boys' wing at the Vermilion Indian Residential School. There are no funds at the present time to satisfy this request, and, as I am very uncertain when such could be provided, I regret that the Department is not in a position to advise you.\n\nI understand that the dormitories provide proper accommodation for a few more pupils and Mr. Ferrier tells me that he has arranged for a pupilage of 40 as from April first, last. This will relieve the situation somewhat.\n\nI have reviewed the proposed expenditure and the appropriation to complete the St. Bruno's Indian Residential School improvements, and I believe there will be very little remaining after the accounts are paid, the present water supply system completed and the electric plant properly installed. I find, however, that, in all probability, we can supply the hot air furnace required for the classroom and dormitory building at Vermilion and, in addition, two sewing machines and two washing machines. In a few days, I will write to the Indian Agent, concerning where he should purchase the hot air furnace. Your Lordship may purchase two inexpensive washing machines and forward a certified account, in duplicate, direct to Ottawa. Two sewing machines will be ordered by the Department.\n\nWith warm personal regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRight Rev. Joseph Guy, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Grouard,\nGrouard, Alta.\nOttawa, July 3, 1931.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to request that you will supply from your nearest branch office, for the use of the Indian Residential School, Fort Vermilion, Alta., two (2) Singer sewing machines, described in your catalogue as follows:\n\nNo. 2 - 5 Drawer Machines, 127 - 3 G.O.\n\nThe machines should be strongly crated and shipped to the following address:\n\nRev. J. Habay, C.M.I.,\nIndian Residential School,\nFort Vermilion, Alta.,\nc/o The Northern Waterways Ltd.,\nWaterways, Alta.\n\nIf these machines are supplied from Edmonton, it would be advisable for your local representative to take up the matter of shipment with the Northern Waterways Limited, 10042 - 101st Street, Edmonton, as this Company has charge of all shipments from this Department from Waterways to northern points.\n\nYour account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the machines F.O.B. Waterways, Alta., should be forwarded direct to the Department, together with shipping bill attached. The account should show the retail price and discount of 50% allowed off the 90 day list price, on which terms purchase is made.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will arrange to have early shipment made of these two machines.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. H. Fayet,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent,\nSinger Sewing Machine Company,\nBank St., OTTAWA.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nAs requested in your letter of July 3rd, we have shipped 2 Sewing Machines to Rev.

We understand that the boat sails from Peace River on July 25th.\n\nOur head office advised that the machines are now supplied to the department at the regular cash price less discount of 45% and have invoiced you as per their instructions.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nManager\n\nIndian Affairs.

I suppose however that there is a certain cast of gloom in the Office. You do not realize how often I think of the dear man for whom I had a real liking. Of course I must say that I have the same sentiments towards you and Mr Sutherland, that said to prevent any jealousy.\n\nNow to the point. Sr Mary Stela of Fort Vermillion or rather Rev Fr Habay has written me about the desks that were refused to the school as per your letter of July 8th, 1932. I feel more than sorry in the matter as they are in absolute need of said desks in that school where we have spent so much last year in erecting a two-story building (annex of 50'x30' to the boy's building). Of course $1,200.00 are on the list of amounts voted but for the painting, heating and supplying bedding to the school. Could not the desks be included in the amount? The heating system costs around $470.00, the painting about the same, the beds (24) should, I presume, cost between $200.00 and $250.00. You could cram in the desks asked for. Don't you think?\n\nIf you are to take action wire order to Moyer's Edmonton with request to pay freight to Peace River and ship in time to catch the boat of Sept. 3rd.\n\nRegarding the beds the Department has been dealing with Parkhill Bedding Edmonton whose manager is aware of the kind already supplied and you could also wire them in the matter for 24 beds and mattresses in order that same may be shipped on the boat of Sept. 3rd.\n\nThe typewriter has also been refused for above school. I am sorry I was not in Ottawa when such request was turned down. On account of the very special work done by the sister with her school publication I had prevailed upon Mr Ferrier to practically assure a typewriter and he had told me to write the sister in order to know the particular type she wanted. Can you reconsider your letter of July 6th?\n\nFinally, I would ask you to add games and the books needed for supplementary reading. You\nGROUARD, ALTA\n\nwould do us a favor by having same mailed in time to reach Vermilion by the boat leaving Peace River on Sept 3rd.\n\nI am writing to you but I suppose Mr Sutherland is acting Superintendent. So, simply pass him my letter and tell him that the good words I have for you apply to him as well\u2014he knows that\u2014and the requests also.\n\nBest regards to the office staff.\n\nI will be around by the beginning of October with receipts for reimbursements for Grouard and other schools and of course with my list of requests for the coming year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Vicar apostolic of Grouard.]\nOttawa, August 22, 1932.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to request that you will forward by freight, charges prepaid, addressed to -\n\nRev.

Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCALGARY, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 8th inst., No.405-12:\n\nThe Convent and the Hospital were burnt at 6 o'clock A.M. on October 7th. The School was saved (boy's part). Dr. Hammon and the nursing Sister managed to save their patients while the Sisters and the Father saved the children, some of them being still in bed. Everything was lost by the fire: furniture, clothes, blankets, stoves, &c.\n\nAs soon as I received the wire, Friday morning, I got two trucks and mustered up all the medical supplies, blankets, clothing, &c., I could get from the agency and the St. Bruno's and St. Bernard's Missions. Three small cases of the most needed medicines were sent, one from Dr. McIntyre, and two from the Mission. No list was kept as we had to rush to pack and get these supplies to Peace River the same night as the boat was leaving the next morning. I sent 25 blankets, 1 bale of underwear, drawers and shirts, 25 white shirts, 1 box hospital shoes, 1 bale kit bags and 30 brushes. The Missions have also sent blankets, clothing, 1 stove and various other supplies. All was loaded on time to leave Peace River on the 8th of October.\n\nWith reference to my wire of the 11th instant, the medicine supplies referred to by Dr. Hammon in his message to me were those sent by us since the fire, as the supplies received from Ottawa recently have been burnt.\n\nI am today sending a Drug Requisition for the St. Theresa's Hospital, to the National Drug Company, Edmonton, as per your instructions. I am enclosing a copy of same for your information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"N.P.L'HEUREUX\"\n\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that I have received a wire from Mr. L'Heureux yesterday morning, stating that he was in receipt of a wire from Father Habey of Fort Vermillion informing him that the Convent and Hospital had been burned down, and asking that blankets and medical supplies be sent on the boat that was waiting at Peace River Landing. Mr. L'Heureux stated in his telegram that he was sending blankets from his stock there.\n\nAs medical supplies were asked for, I instructed Mr. L'Heureux to have Dr. McIntyre make out a list of medical supplies that he thought would be absolutely necessary for the present time, the Agent to fill the order from his own stock kept at the Agency, and to purchase any additional medicine that was required and get it on the boat last night. This was the only means of providing the medicine as the Agent could motor to Peace River Landing, and get them on the boat there.\n\nIn the Department's telegram received this morning I note that this hospital has only been supplied with medicine by the Department. I presume that the only means of getting the blankets was to wire the Agency as it would be impossible to purchase them at Fort Vermillion. This, of course, can be adjusted later on. I do not know the number of blankets shipped.\n\nI shall ascertain immediately what method of winter transportation there is from Peace River to Fort Vermillion. There might possibly be boats still making the trip this fall.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nif the weather remains favourable.\n\nI presume the medical supplies that were sent up in September were in the hospital at the time of the fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Father Habeg's report which was received on the 14th of December, but the Rev. Principal has not given any particulars as to the total loss, and he has not stated either what supplies are still needed. As the mail service is very slow, especially in Winter time I do not expect to be able to get a satisfactory report before next Spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.P.

The flames were seen first in the kitchen. The only fire in that section of the house at the time was in the kitchen range. Whether the big fire actually originated there and then spread elsewhere, we do not know. The flames had made such headway when discovered, it was impossible to ascertain just how and where the fire had begun.\n\nAll patients in the hospital and some small children in the girls' dormitory were removed at once.\n\nThe opening of doors caused the flames to spread and mount upward at terrific speed. Fire extinguishers were used, but to no avail. In a few minutes the entire building containing the apartments for the Sisters, the Indian girls, the Chapel, the bakery, and the kitchens, together with the St. Anne's Hospital which adjoined it were a mass of flames and all hope of saving anything had to be abandoned.\n\nThe building in which are the two classrooms, the Boys' Hall, refectory and dormitory, was in great danger. The side exposed to the fire was badly scorched and the roof began to burn. With extreme effort and the assistance of a bucket brigade, axes and several hand pumps, the building was saved.\nIt is in this building that the Sisters and all the pupils are living at present. The Boys' section is 30 feet by 50 feet. The Girls' section is 25 feet by 50 feet. The second floor of this building is used for the dormitory.\n\nAll pupils enrolled were not present when the fire occurred, but of those who were, not one was sent home. Three pupils have returned to school since the fire and two new ones were admitted.\n\nThe pupils are all enjoying good health. Thomas Ashkabat, Beaver Indian of ten years, died on December 7th. He had been ill since last spring.\n\nThe classwork is carried on as usual. The pupils seem happy and contented and manifest lively interest in their work.\n\nA temporary building of 34 by 46 feet is underway. It will be occupied by the Indian girls as soon as possible.\n\nJoseph Halloway\n\nIndian Affairs.

Anderson of the Canada Products of Edmonton to have a carload of cement (500 sacks at least) ready to leave Edmonton in order to take the Fort Vermilion boat leaving Peace River on May 20th. Could you kindly\u2014if in order\u2014confirm said order by wire to Mr Anderson? You will note that Mr Anderson is on the patronage list.\n\nI have also asked for a range-6' long with two fires and two ovens\u2014and a bake oven. Regarding the latter\u2014the Department used to buy from Daoust Limited St Boniface, Man. The architect of the Department as well as the officers of the School Branch are conversant with the type of Bake oven sold by the above firm. If the latter was chosen I would mention a No. 3 Bake oven. As to the range I have not communicated with any firm but I could do so and submit prices. I may say the same of the hand washing machines that I mentioned to you.\n\nI leave the whole matter to your kind consideration with the hope that you will find your way to help us in our present distress.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBishop of Grouard;\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am sure this would give the teacher there a little encouragement. They can get along without the desks. They were using benches while I was there and they can still use them. The teacher had a little rickety old table that they had manufactured themselves, and I am sure they would appreciate getting the desk.\n\nThis does not cost very much, and if possible I would like to see it supplied.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nM.

(RG 10, Volume 6376, file 766-5, part 1)\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report on an inspection of St. Henry's Roman Catholic Boarding School at Fort Vermilion. As the Department are aware, the school and hospital were burned down last fall, but a new school is under construction at the present time, and I am attaching hereto a snap of the building.\n\nI found there were 66 children on the register, but only 56 were present at that time. The grades taught there are from I to V. Besides the above number there are also quite a few Halfbreeds attending the school.\n\nAfter the fire last fall some of the outbuildings were converted into living quarters and the school authorities certainly did well to bring the children through the winter as they did. The new school is being partly used at the present time, but they expect to have it completed before fall.\n\nMy visit to this institution was on Sunday afternoon and I could not examine the classroom work, but I am sure from the children's work that I saw that good work is being done. The two\n\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6376, file 766-5, part 1)\nclassrooms were well maintained and I am quite confident that the teachers in charge are very capable. The staff consists of the Rev. Principal, Joe. Habay; Asst. Principal, Father Deman, two lay brother and 10 Sisters of Providence.\n\nBUILDINGS:\n\nThe new school building is a three story building, 34 X 46. The top is 30 feet from the ground. Besides this they have an old building 100 X 30 that is used as a dormitory and classroom. The laundry is a separate building: This is a terrible place,- an old dilapidated building and in very poor state of repair. The sister informed me that it was a very difficult matter to work there in the winter and I quite see that this is the case.\n\nThe grounds surrounding the buildings are excellent as it is situated right on the banks of the Peace River, which is one mile across at that point. This mission was started first in 1863, but has been permanently maintained since 1878. The first school was build in 1899: a frame building was erected in 1908 and was burned to the ground in 1914; rebuilt in 1917 and burned to the ground in 1932. The school owns 260 acres of land. At present they have under crop 15 acres of wheat, 35 acres of oats and 25 acres of barley as well as 20 acres of rye and about 3 acres in garden. They own 32 cattle, 22 horses, 25 pigs and 60 chickens. At the time I was there they were milking 8 cows, therefore the children received all the milk they required. The children all\nlooked well and this was born out by the results of an examination by the Doctor.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, August 17, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, regarding the request of the Sister Superior of the St. Henry Indian Residential School at Fort Vermilion to be supplied with 100 pillows for use in the hospital and in the boys' and girls' dormitories at the school.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department has already paid accounts covering the cost of furnishing a considerable amount of supplies to this school during the present fiscal year, as follows:\n\n1 wood burning Oven - $325.00 Fire Extinguishers $180.\n500 sacks Cement - 475.00 Blankets & Sheeting 286.\n3 Sewing Machines - 119.22 Beds & Mattresses 602.\n\nThe Department will have no other funds available to provide the pillows, and I would request that you inform the Rev. Sister Superior accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nN. P. L'Heureux, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\nDriftpile, Alberta,\nAugust 8th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of a communication received from the Rev. Sister Superior of St. Henry Indian Residential School of Fort Vermilion, asking whether the Indian Department would be kind enough to supply them with 100 pillows which are required for the Hospital, and boys' and girls' dormitories as they have lost all their bedding furniture and clothes through the fire they had last fall. They have managed to re-build, but much smaller and their finances have permitted them to provide only the very strictest necessities.

The church authorities, under the direction of His Lordship Bishop Guy, erected a new building for the girls during the past summer. This is a three-story frame building, 34' x 46'. The only contribution made by the Department was payment for 500 sacks of cement used in the foundation of the building. Bishop Guy authorized this undertaking. We have received no particulars regarding the cost of materials and labour in carrying out the work. During his recent visit, Bishop Guy made a request to be reimbursed to the extent of $5,000.00 towards the expenditure incurred by the church authorities.\n\nMaterials and equipment for the new building have been supplied as follows:\n\n| Item                        | Quantity | Cost   |\n|-----------------------------|----------|--------|\n| 500 sacks of cement         |          | $475.00|\n| Bake oven                   |          | $325.00|\n| Sewing machines             |          | $119.22|\n| Fire extinguishers and freight on same |          | $193.60|\n| Blankets and sheeting       |          | $285.00|\n| Beds and mattresses         |          | $602.00|\n| Hotel range                 |          | $366.33|\n| Teacher's desk              |          | $28.00 |\n\nTotal: $2,304.15\n\nThe mission at Fort Vermilion was started in 1863. The first school was built in 1899; a frame building was erected in 1908 and burned in 1914, rebuilt by the church in 1917 and burned on October 7, 1932. This is the building that has been erected, towards the cost of which Bishop Guy requests reimbursement to the amount stated above. His Lordship undertook the erection of the new girls' building without reference to the Department, and no promise was made him that a grant would be provide towards the cost. Grant is provided for 65 pupils at $150 per capita, less 10% during the present fiscal year. There is an enrolment of 33 boys and 33 girls.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo...Rev.

I would recommend that these articles be sent.\n\nI am also sending you a snapshot which I received from him, and you will see that the buildings were all surrounded by water in the recent flood. The square building in the centre, between the church and the long building, is the school that was being erected when I was there last summer.

They use some very crude seats made locally; out of proportion as to height of seat and table and without provision for a proper back-rest. I would judge that such seats impose on the children a severe physical strain.\n\nWill you kindly consider remedying to this defect by supplying the reverend Principal with the quantity of pupils desks and seats as listed in the enclosed requisition.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN.

Phelan,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Phil:\n\nMay I remind you of requests for beds intended for our different schools. As the school year is at hand and in the case of Fort Vermillion navigation will soon come to an end I take the liberty of writing again in the matter. Kindly attend to the matter. I would suggest you take Parkhill Bedding Co. of Edmonton (the Company is on the privileged list at least in Winnipeg where are the Headquarters) in order to have uniformity and secure repairs when necessary. Almost all our beds are from that firm.\n\nThe Fort Vermilion School needs 6 Fire Extinguishers of 2\u00bd gallons Each (Loose Stopple Type). We have built an addition 24'x 30', three stories high, and as there were not enough fire extinguishers beforehand I would appreciate your sending the above.\n\nHere in Grouard, we have built a school 40'x50' two stories high (four class rooms) and full concrete basement. We have built a three story addition to the girls house, 24'x28' with bakery and dairy in the basement and a 100'x36' cow stable. We need fire extinguishers for all these additions as also for the laundry which is now being installed (20'x40') in the basement of the boys' house.

School.\n\nI had just forwarded my letter of yesterday when I received from the carpenter of Fort Vermilion the precise figures and specifications for the chicken-house. Please consider this as correct requisitions.\n\nThe Principal of the School called on me and after discussion we have found that, due to the time the material will be at hand, it will be possible to build in logs as expected. It is possible to get rough lumber at about the same price logs would cost. As the money allotted for this building, we will provide ourselves the rough lumber requested.\n\nLet me point out that there is two boats going down the river twice a month. The next trip will be on the 25th and the 28th of June.\n\nI may seem rather bothersome with all these details, but please remember that the money allotted will not cover all the expenses. If we could save on transportation and by buying locally, it would be so much.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. S. Lajoie, O.M.I.,\nGrouard, Alta.\nWORK\n\nat\n\nFort Vermilion Ind. Resid.

I have not charged the cement used, neither the transportation of the material not to make too high a bill. After keen consideration, we have decided to build a larger chicken-house than first contemplated. The house measures 60' x 20'. It is impossible to buy eggs at Fort Vermilion. Our intention was to have room enough to keep a herd of hens sufficient to supply the School with eggs.\n\nMost of the lumber has been bought locally as authorized by your letter of the 14th of June and at the price prevailing at Fort Vermilion where lumber is rather dear. The roofing consisting in corrugated iron had to be bought in Edmonton. The transportation from Peace River to Fort Vermilion has not been charged. In fact, all transportation expenses have been absorbed by us.\n\nHoping that everything will be found according to the regulations of the Department, I remain,\n\nDear Sir, Yours very truly,\n\nF.

Vermilion Indian Residential School.\n\nAs instructed in your memorandum of January 20th last, arrangements were made for an inspection of the water supply at the above School, and report received is attached in duplicate.\n\nThe present methods of obtaining water at this School are apparently most primitive. Also, there is no interior plumbing in the building and toilets are dry and outside. The possibility of improvement in the future, in the way of interior sanitary plumbing, has therefore to be kept in mind when considering action in connection with the water supply.\n\nFrom his investigations our Engineer's opinion is that water must be obtained either from wells or from the Peace River. He favours, as the most suitable and economical solution, endeavouring to get water from wells in close proximity to the buildings.\n\nWe therefore recommend the work estimated at $1,650.00 by our Engineer, and detailed on page 2 of his report. This covers the digging of a well, construction near well of a pumphouse to house a 3,000 gallon tank and pump, and the laying of a capacity pipe line from pumphouse to two 600 gallon tanks in the basement of convent as well as two new 600 gallon tank to be installed in the basement of the boys' dormitory.\n\nThe water will then be distributed through the buildings by hand as has been done in the past, or if the Indian Affairs Department wish to stand on power at interior plumbing two shallow well electric pumps at $125.00 each might be purchased for interior distribution of water which would increase the total estimate to $1,900.00 as given on page 3 of our Engineer's report. The power available is a 9 H.P. engine with a Lister, 110 volt, D.C. generator.\n\nIn the above estimate, expenditures for labour are based on prevailing rates in the district as referred to by our Engineer in the second last paragraph of his report.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (R3 10, Volume 6376, file 766-5, part 2)\nBanff, Alberta,\nFebruary 17th, 1939.\n\nREPORT on Water Supply Situation at\nFort Vermillion Mission, Alta.\nFebruary 9th, 1939.\n\nThe mission buildings are situated on the right bank of the Peace River and on a flat bench about six or seven feet above the usual high-water mark. During the spring of 1934 an ice-jam in the river caused the flow to back up and flood this bench to a depth of from one to two feet of water.\n\nBehind the mission buildings a range of low hills parallels the river bank with the base of the hills being about 1500 feet back from the river bank. Along the base of the hills runs an old beaver channel which would be about three feet lower than the ground upon which the mission buildings are sited. This depression is now thickly wooded with poplar and spruce trees and is wet during the spring and early summer. This depression acts as a collecting basin for the spring run-off from the hills and also for water coming from weak springs and seepages along the base of the hill.\n\nThe mission buildings have no plumbing or baths and the toilets are all dry and outside. The water, which to a person used to modern city water supply facilities is at present used most sparingly, is obtained from two wells and collected rainwater, while the drinking water is obtained by melting ice obtained from the Peace River. One well is situated near the barn and supplies the stock. This well is 25 feet deep with a 5 foot bottom and has about 4 feet of water standing in it and a fairly strong flow. The other well is inside the kitchen of the convent and is 23 feet deep, 5 x 5 foot bottom, and has about 3'-6\" of water in it, but not a strong flow. This well water is fairly hard for washing and laundry purposes and the Sisters prefer to use rainwater or water hauled from the river for these purposes.\n\nI was informed by the mission authorities that seepages of water occur along the river bank in the vicinity of the mission. These did not show at the time of my inspection, February 9th. This fact, combined with that of the present wells,\nleads me to believe that sufficient water for the mission could be found in a well or wells, if proper water storage facilities are provided. At present there are two 600-gallon tanks in the basement of the convent used for storing rainwater collected from the roof.\n\nThe mission principal, Rev. Father Guernereur, was hopeful that some means could be found to pipe water to the mission from the springs and seepages along the base of the hills behind the mission. I was taken to the site of the strongest spring, a distance of over 2000 feet from the convent building, and found it to be absolutely dry with no flow on the 9th February, 1939. There was an area of a few square yards of ice around the site but no sign of any flow of water. In view of the absence of water on that date, I do not think it worth while to give the proposition of piping water from these springs and seepages any further consideration; which means that any additional supply of water for the mission must be obtained from wells or the Peace River the most suitable and economical solution being that of getting it from wells in close proximity to the buildings.\n\nIn drawing up any plans for a water supply system, probable early developments and improvements in facilities should be taken into consideration. At present the water facilities are not very advanced except the absence of outside dry toilets, no inside plumbing whatever and no fire protection. I believe that when funds are available the Indian Affairs Branch would like to install inside plumbing with baths, toilets and septic tanks, and provide fire hydrants, and I was given to understand that it is probable a hospital will be built at this mission in the near future. With this in mind, I beg to make the following recommendations for providing a sufficient supply of water. These recommendations will cover only digging a well, providing increased storage facilities and taking the water from the well to the storage tanks. They will not cover the cost of distributing the water throughout the interior of the buildings.\n\nI would suggest that first of all a well be found containing a suitable quantity of water. I suggested a site about 200 feet behind the convent where it is believed a well 23 to 25 feet deep will be sufficient. If this is made with a 6 x 6 foot bottom, a flow of from 1200 to 1500 gallons a day will probably be found. If this flow, or better, is found on this site, an electric deep well pump should be installed and a lumber tank to hold 3000 gallons of water built over the well, both pump and tank to be housed in a warmly built sunhouse with a small heater. The water can then flow by gravity through 1-1/8\" mains buried at least 7 feet underground to the present storage tanks in the basement of the convent and to a new 600-gallon tank which should be installed in the...\nbasement of the boys' dormitory. The water can then be distributed from the basements throughout the buildings by automatic shallow well type electric pumps.\n\nThe purpose of the 3000-gallon storage tank is to provide a reservoir where a reserve supply of water may be built up for washdays and for fire protection purposes. The well should be sited so as to minimize the possibility of contamination from surface water. Consequently, it should be well away from the barns and dry privies and away from the disposal field of any probable septic tank system.\n\nESTIMATE OF COST\n\nDigging and cribbing well $120.00\nConstructing 3000-gal. storage tank (lumber), including materials $100.00\nConstructing pumphouse (frame construction), including materials $450.00\n450 lineal feet 1-1/2\" galvanized iron pipe with fittings, delivered to Pt. Vermilion $130.00\nOne, deep well type electric pump, installed with 2\" casing $200.00\nTwo, shallow well electric pumps @ 125.00 $250.00\nExcavating trench for pipe and backfilling $275.00\nLaying pipe $25.00\nOne, 600-gal. galvanized iron water tank (not pressure tank) $200.00\nContingencies and Engineering expenses $180.00\n\n$2,900.00\n\nShould this project be approved, I would recommend that the work be done by the local mission authorities under the Indian Affairs Branch. The prevailing rates for labour paid by the mission are little more than half those of the western Fair Wage Scale set by the Dept. of Labour and for our Branch to go in there and pay the higher rates of pay would make things decidedly awkward for the local authorities. Consequently, I believe that best interests of the department will be served if the Engineering Service remains in an advisory capacity only.\n\nThe work can be undertaken at any season of the year, although winter work would put the cost of labour up. Probably, the best time to do this work would be the late summer time or fall of the year.\n\nC.K. Lebapelin\nAssistant Engineer.\nMarch 10, 1939\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill.\n\nRe: Ft. Vermilion School Water Supply.\n\nOur Engineer, Mr. C. K. LeCapelain, visited the above school and made a thorough inspection of the water supply. He has now submitted a report, a copy of which is attached, as is also a copy of a covering memorandum from our Chief Engineer.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. LeCapelain recommends that a new well be dug, a new pump house to house a 3000 gallon tank and pump be constructed, and a new pipe line laid to tanks in the basements of the convent and the boys' dormitory. The cost of this work is estimated at $1,650. It is also noted that, if your Branch wish to have a water pump for distribution, two shallow well electric pumps might be purchased at $125 each, bringing the total cost up to $1,900.\n\nBlue prints are attached showing the location of the various buildings, and also a number of photographs.\n\nDirector.\nOTTAWA, March 15th, 1939.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nRe Water Supply - Vermilion School\n\nIn connection with the report from the Surveys and Engineering Branch, regarding necessary improvements to the water situation at the above mentioned school, see letter of March 15th, 1939, addressed to Rev.

I am today informed by the Surveys & Engineering Branch that an engineer will visit your school at as early a date as possible and give you the necessary instructions in connection with the work.\n\nEarly next week an accountable cheque for $1650.00 will be forwarded to you. As soon as the work is completed you should forward a voucher in triplicate to which should be attached receipts giving detailed information regarding the manner in which the money was expended. If there is any balance remaining it should be returned to the Department. This is the only manner in which we can properly handle the work from an accounting standpoint.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J.

Mills,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Water supply for Indian schools at Grouard, Fort Vermilion, Sturgeon Lake and Joussard.\n\nWe have practically no information about the ground water occurrences near the above mentioned schools, but judging from the geology it seems advisable to limit the depth of drilling in some cases.\n\nThe chances of getting a water supply near the Sturgeon Lake School are probably good. The district is underlain by the Wapiti formation which contains several sand horizons that carry a good water supply in the Peace River district. I cannot tell to what depth you will have to drill here but it should be no deeper than the top of the black shale which underlies the Wapiti formation.\n\nThe chances are probably poor of getting a supply of good water from the bedrock of all the other schools and drilling should be confined to the surface deposits. The bedrock in these places is a black or dark grey shale.\n\nIt is impossible to tell exactly where you should drill, without having seen the ground. Usually in searching for water in the surface deposits, gravel ridges and stream valleys are good places to prospect.\n\nWe will be very glad to co-operate with you in any way we can, and if you wish to consult us please do so at any time.\n\nIf you drill please let us know what results you get in order that we may have the information on file.\n\n(Sgd.)

The 720 gallon pressure tank should be installed horizontally under the boys' dormitory. Excavate a trench 7 foot deep from the corner of the girls' dormitory to a convenient point for taking water into the kitchen.\n\nExcavate a place for the pressure tank in the basement of the boys' dormitory. Excavate a trench from the well to the water's edge to depth shown on accompanying plan and dynamite a trench from the water's edge to a point where the water will be about 5 to 7 feet deep in winter, according to instructions for doing this kind of work that will be sent you by the C.I.L.\n\n(2) As soon as approval of location is received from the Provincial Government dig and crib well 6' x 6' inside on the site shown on the plan and staked on the ground. Crib with 2\" plank with 4\"x4\" or 2\"x6\" corner pieces. This well should be dug about 50' deep if possible below level of road or to 10' below the level of the river so that the well will be in water bearing strata which will likely be encountered at a depth of from 20 to 25 feet will likely be hard surface water and should be prevented from entering the well if possible by a clay coating outside the cribbing at the point where it enters. The aim in digging this well is two-fold; (1) to endeavour to get a flow of soft water from the river and to form a reservoir for storing or clarifying water that could be pumped into it from the river.\n\n(3) As soon as pipe arrives, lay it in the trench and cover with straw and then earth. Be sure all the branch fittings or offtakes have been placed where desired or shown on the plan before covering pipe.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6376, file 766-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n(4) Build a moveable platform in the well, hung by cables or chains from the roof, on which the pump will set and connect chains and chain block.\n\nConnect pump to pump hoses and connect hoses to pipe, intake and offtake, as near as shown on plan as possible.\n\n(5) Connect wire from Power House line to conduit and connect conduit to wall switch in well and thence to pump.\n\nIt would be well to have a starting switch in the Power House so that well pump may be started and stopped from there.\n\n(6) Run wires under road in \u00bd\" conduit.\n\n(7) Pump will work most efficiently if kept from 5 to 10 feet above the level of the water in the well.\n\n(8) Set pressure tank on wooden saddles made out of 6\" x 12\" timbers.\n\n(9) Set and adjust air control valve in accordance with instructions enclosed.\n\nThe enclosed sketch plans will serve as a guide for the installation of this system.\n\nCommunicate with this office for any further instructions or information desired.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nC.M.

M. Walker, Supervising Engineer, in connection with the water system at the Vermilion Indian residential school.\n\nI understand from this letter that Mr. Walker has arranged for the purchase of the materials required and no doubt they have reached you by this time.\n\nThe estimated cost of the labour was as follows:\n\nTo dig and crib well 5 x 6 to 50 ft. depth ........$120.00\nExcavating trench for pipe and back-filling ....... 200.00\nMiscellaneous: freight and incidentals ............ 305.26\n\nTotal $625.26\n\nAn accountable cheque for $500.00 was forwarded the latter part of June to Rev. J. Huguerre, O.M.I., Principal of the Vermilion residential school. If you require the balance estimated for the labour, please let me know.\n\nIt is most important that the cost of the new water system should not exceed the amount estimated by Mr. Walker in his letter of August 16.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Hoey, Supt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI was just starting to write you in connection with the credit allotted for the water system at Fort Vermilion Indian School when your letter reached me this morning.\n\nAccording to the estimates made by the Engineers, the expense there will amount to $1,650.00. Having received but $500.00, the Principal complaints of shortage of money to have the work properly done and the material paid. It would surely relieve the Father if the balance of the money allotted for the installation of the water was forwarded to him without delay. I understand that you await a request to do so. Please forward money, I mean the balance, as soon as possible.\n\nI have not received yet any details as to the cost of the work. I hope it will not run over the estimates. We should know before long.\n\nHere, at Grouard, it is not easy to find suitable water. Water was encountered at 330 feet, rather soft water, but it was so dirty that it was out of question to use such water. We have to go deeper. By the rest, the laying of the pipes is over. If we could get water, the installation would be completed in a few days.\n\nThanking you for the interest you pay to our problems,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. S.

However, it appears from the information received from Bishop Langlois that the work has not yet been completed.\n\nNo provision is being made in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41 for money required in connection with the water systems at these schools and moreover the principal of each of the schools is anxious to secure a considerable amount of new equipment if funds available in the current year's appropriation are not being used in connection with the water systems.\n\nThe season is advancing and I am extremely anxious to know at the earliest possible date what progress has been made at each of the four schools mentioned above, also when the water systems at these schools will be completed.\nI understand from the information contained in memoranda that you have submitted in connection with the above that all the materials required have been purchased.\n\nI trust that you will find it possible to let me have, at the earliest possible date, a complete statement regarding the situation at each of these schools.\n\nDirector.\nGrouard, Alta., Nov. 20th, 1939.\n\nMr. R.A.

It seems that this has not gone through since I have been advised lately that the clock asked for had not been received yet.\n\nI would appreciate you giving personal attention to this matter. You understand how important it is to ascertain if the night watchman pays regular visits to buildings.\n\nThe address I find on one of these clocks is:\nDavis Paradis Watchmen's Clock Corporation, New-York, U.S.\n\nThanking you in advance for the attention you will give to this question,\n\nI remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

I could order the clock right away so that it would be at hand within a few weeks at the most.

Provided he does not take any exception to the amount paid for the clock the Department will favourably consider refunding the money to the school management from the appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Some additional work is required and the total estimated cost is placed at $2,000, the original allotment being \u00a31,650.\n\nIn connection with these water supply systems I have your memorandum of the 11th instant quoting from a letter received from the Rt. Rev. U. Langlois, in which he recommends the employment of Mr. J.L. Gervais, of Montreal, to locate the exact spot where a well should be drilled. This matter will be referred to our Engineers and given full consideration, although it is doubtful if Mr. Gervais would be able to locate water by his method at depths to which the wells are being dug.\n\nJ.

No order is being placed for the goods at the present time because I thought that before ordering any supplies it would be advisable to write to you.\n\nThere has been a considerable reduction in our appropriation and consequently the under-mentioned amounts will be available for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the five schools in the Grouard Diocese during the current fiscal year:\n\n|                  | Repairs | New Equipment |\n|------------------|---------|---------------|\n| GROUARD          | $600.00 | $1,000.00     |\n| JOUSSARD         | 700.00  | 1,000.00      |\n| STURGEON LAKE    | 2,000.00|               |\n| VERMILION        | 350.00  | 300.00        |\n| WABASCA          | 1,100.00|               |\n\n$4,750.00  $2,300.00 Total $7,050.00\n\nThe above is the total amount that we can expend on the five schools in the Grouard Diocese during the current fiscal year and before making any purchases I thought it advisable to write to you and suggest that you have your five Principals submit their requests to you so that you can decide what is the most necessary expenditure.\n\nRev. S. Lajoie, O.M.I.,\nAdministrator,\nGrouard, Alta.\nIn talking to Father Beuglet recently he pointed out that something will have to be done in connection with the water supply at Wabasca. Possibly additional expenditures will have to be made at some of the other schools in connection with the water supply work done during the fiscal year just closed. All of these necessary expenditures should receive your consideration.\n\nConsequently if we receive any requests for disbursements from any Principal direct we will return it to you for your recommendation before proceeding with either a purchase order or an authorization.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nGrouard, Alta., May 11th, 1940.\n\nFile 131-13-4.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey, Supt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nAnswering yours of the 30th of April last re: Requisition of Tools and of some Sport Goods for our Fort Vermilion Residential School, I beg to state that I deem it would be a bad policy to refuse equipment if we want to train children in most usual work. The inability of most Indians due to unpreparedness to provide for themselves has been deplored since too long. The Department is anxious to remediate to the situation by having the young generation taught in the most usual trades. The Principals of our Schools take a keen interest in the matter. I think it would be unfair to them to refuse the equipment absolutely needed to obtain results.\n\nShould I understand that this expense will be charged against the appropriation allotted to our Schools for repairs and equipment for the year 1940-41? I hope not. Should not at least the tools for the workshop and the garden be paid by the Department from another source? These tools come for Indian Schools in the school material as manual Training as a part of the course the children receive. If you can't do so, I mean avoid to charge these tools against the coming allotment for our Schools, please let me know.\n\nAs to the Gymnasium Equipment, I would be pleased to hear that the Department will take care of it too. If it is found impossible, please postpone filling the requisition. I will see what we can do to remediate the present situation.\n\nYour letter brings me bad news. The appropriation for repairs and equipment in our schools is reduced to $7,050.00. It is not much for five schools.\nI hope that this curtailment will not be followed by a reduction of the grants re: pupilage. If the price of life commodities keeps on going up, the situation will become serious if not critical before long. We are doing our best to get revenue from farm and garden, but there is no remedy to draught. It looks better this spring. Sufficient moisture for the season. We need warm weather.\n\nI appreciate that you will submit to me any request presented by any of our schools. It will help keeping the money for most necessary expenditure.\n\nWhile in Ottawa, I applied to Mr. Phelan for two sewing machines (not Tailor's) for Wabasca. It does not seem that they have been shipped at date. As there is a lot of tailor's work to be done in summer time, I would appreciate these two machines being shipped as soon as possible. Address: R.C. Indian Residential School, Wabasca, via Slave Lake, Alta.\n\nLet me profit by this opportunity to thank you for the interest you have paid to the refund of monies advanced for the water system. I was surely pleased to hear that Sturgeon Lake School had received the $500.00 recommended by the Engineers.\n\nMay I point out that there should be a balance of $111.60 coming for Fort Vermilion. I presume this will not delay.\n\nIn February, I presented a bill for transportation of children at our Grouard School. Not having heard of since, I wonder if I can expect refund. May I put the same question for J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co.'s bill covering Watchman Clock for Fort Vermilion. Vouchers were attached.\n\nThanking you once more, I remain,\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.S. Lajoie, O.M.I.\nGrouard, Alta.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6376, file 766-5, part 2)\n**J.

Since writing to you on April 30 the estimates have been reconsidered and it is now definitely decided that the following amounts will be available:\n\n| SCHOOL       | REPAIRS AND IMPROVEMENTS | PURCHASE OF NEW EQUIPMENT |\n|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Grouard      | $900.00                   | $1,500.00                 |\n| Joussard     | 900.00                    | 1,500.00                  |\n| Sturgeon Lake| 2,400.00                  |                           |\n| Vermillion   | 500.00                    | 600.00                    |\n| Wabasca      | 1,500.00                  |                           |\n\nI note what you say regarding the requisition for tools for the vocational training work at the Vermillion Residential School. Present regulations require us to charge the cost of these to the amount provided for the Vermillion School. The Purchasing Agent will be requested to secure them but, as mentioned in your letter, the gymnasium equipment will not be ordered.\n\nTwo sewing machines for Wabasca will also be ordered at once. It has been decided to allow $50.00 toward the cost of the watchman's clock. Both of these items, of course, will be charged against the amount appropriated for the respective schools.\n\nRev. S. Lajoie, O.M.I.,\nAdministrator,\nGrouard, Alta.\nI have reviewed our file and cannot find the account of $111.60 which you mention is still owing in connection with work done at the Vermillion Residential School. Please forward another voucher for this amount. You should advise me later how you wish the balance available expended. In the case of any equipment or supplies detailed information should be given so that purchase may be made by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nPay $50 or make\nunderstand more for R. P.\n\nEXT.\n\n11/6/40\nGrouard, Alta., June 14th, 1940.\n\nFile 131-13-5.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Supt. of Wel. & Training,\nIndian Affairs Department,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nExcuse if I have delayed so long acknowledging receipt of yours of May 28th. Being alone at Grouard, I am called out of Town quite often.\n\nI am surely pleased to know that it has been possible to raise credit for Repairs and Improvements and for Purchase of New Equipment to $9,800.00. It is less than last year, but yet better than announced previously. We surely need this to face the situation. The reduction on per capita grant will reflect heavily on our finances. We do our best to cut expenses.\n\nI take notice of what you say about the purchasing of two sewing machines for Wabasca and of tools for Fort Vermillion as well as of the charging of $50.00 for the Watchman's Clock for this school. For this item, let me point out that it has been paid and vouchers forwarded. May I expect refund before long.\n\nAs to the balance I was expecting as refund for the expenses incurred for the Water System at Fort Vermillion, it is not easy for me to give full details as I have not in hands copy of all the vouchers sent by Rev. F. Huguerre. Neither do I get a detailed report of the items covered by Department's cheque 33812, $266.60. According to F. Huguerre's statement, it has been expended $2,378.85. Of this, $2,307.42 were paid or refund by the Department leaving a balance of $71.43. It was impossible to secure vouchers for an item of $11.00. There would be a balance of $60.43. If I had details of the amount of $226.60 referred to above, it could be possible for me to trace this balance.\n\nAs soon as the Bishop will be back, we will decide on the use of the credit and let you know.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. S. Lajoie, O.M.I.\nOttawa,\nJune 24, 1940.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant I enclose statement showing the manner in which we arrived at the amount of $266.60 paid to you by cheque 33612. I may also say that cheque 46045 dated April 27 for $440.82 was issued and sent to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Jasper Avenue, Edmonton. I also enclose information regarding the manner in which the total of this cheque was reached. As far as our files indicate we have paid all accounts that the Principal has forwarded in connection with the well at the Fort Vermilion Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

In your wire of September 7th, which did not reach this office until Monday morning, Sept. 9th, you stated that you could ship the desks immediately in a pool car leaving Waterloo September 9th.

In your wire of September 7th, which did not reach this office until Monday morning, Sept. 9th, you stated that you could ship the desks immediately in a pool car leaving Waterloo September 9th. We therefore wired you on the 9th ultimo to ship the desks to Peace River and sent our covering order in confirmation of this wire.\n\nWe have received a communication from the Indian Affairs Branch indicating that there was some doubt as to whether the desks had arrived at Peace River in time to catch the last boat for Fort Vermilion.

They have profited by the nice weather this fall to complete the work.\n\nThey have been fortunate enough to get an abundant supply of fairly soft water. It is a big improvement on what they had in the past. Let us hope that the water problem is solved at the Fort Vermilion Indian School for many years if not forever.\n\nThanking you for the help you have given us in the solution of this problem,\n\nI remain,\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. S. Lejoie, O.M.I.,\nGrouard, Alta.\nDear Father Lajoie:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo enclosing voucher amounting to $339.00 covering wages in connection with the water system at the Vermilion Indian Residential School.\n\nOn November 30, 1940, the following amounts were unexpended in connection with the schools in the Grouard Diocese:\n\n- Grouard ........... $2,048.57\n- Joussard .......... 1,519.76\n- Sturgeon Lake ..... 1,579.86\n- Vermilion .......... 182.68\n- Wabasca .......... 786.69\n\nThe purchase of washing machinery and other items already requested will reduce the above amounts and it is quite possible that you have other accounts for wages which you have not yet forwarded.\n\nYou will note, however, that the credit balance at the Vermilion School is only $182.68 and consequently the amount of $339.00 cannot be paid at the present time. We will have to transfer money from some one of the other schools in your Diocese to the Vermilion School to enable us to pay the $339.00 account and this will require an Order-in-Council. Before securing this I thought it advisable to wait until we had the whole picture before us as it may be necessary to make other transfers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. S.

Hoey, Supt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI am just notified by Rev. Father Huguerre, Principal at the Indian School at Fort Vermillion, that the roof of flour-mill has to be renewed this year. The heavy rains of this summer have disclosed that the old roof is not safe especially on a flour-mill.\n\nAs the last scheduled trip for Fort Vermillion will leave Peace River in the last week of September, I take the liberty of requesting the authorization of ordering myself the material needed. Besides, it is not easy to give by letter the precise specifications of the material needed. We want a galvanized iron roof, undulated. According to the traveller of The Western Steel Products who called on me this morning, the material will cost $150.00 around.\n\nYou are surely aware that it is not easy to get prompt delivery of material just now. It is why I would appreciate an answer within a short future. We can't take any chance on the flour and we have just a month or so to have the material shipped this fall. This is going by Air Mail.\n\nThanking you in advance for the attention you will give to this matter, I remain, Dear Mr. Hoey,\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. S.

Specific\ninformation regarding the farm machinery that is required and\nreasons why this equipment is urgently needed are given on the\napplication form.\n\nNow, I quite understand that it is impossible to\nobtain this equipment for shipment this Spring, but it would be\nsatisfactory if the equipment could be forwarded to Fort Vermilion\nduring the navigation period, that is, from June to August\ninclusively, so the equipment could reach Fort Vermilion this year,\nso it could be available for use next Spring. If the equipment\ndid not reach Fort Vermilion this year, this would mean that it could\nbe used before the Spring of 1947.\n\nAs explained to you in my letter of March 26th,\nthe Fort Vermilion Residential School is purchasing this equipment\nfrom their own funds and would therefore reimburse the Department\nthe cost of this farm machinery.\n\nI trust that the purchasing Agent of the Department\nwill do all he possibly can to secure this equipment and forward\nsame this Summer. Spring is very late here this year and ice is\nstill very solid on the Peace River although navigation usually\nopens at the end of April. It usually closes on September 20th;\nthis explains why the order should reach Peace River no later than\nthe end of August to make sure that delivery can be made in time.\n\nThere you have in a short story how merchandise is\ndelivered to the Fort Vermilion Residential School; it is only\nfrom May to September that supplies can be shipped to Fort Vermilion;\nThey can not shop all year round, as you or I can do so.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, a representative of Pedlar People called and requested more complete information in order that he could tender on the equipment desired. It is, therefore, requested that if possible a blueprint of materials required or measurements by a sketch of the layout of stalls and pens could be furnished; this would help materially in the firm quoting more intelligently on the list of goods.\n\nIt is also requested that a more complete explanation be furnished in regard to item reading \"3 only combined loges 46'6\" enclosure, 20' enclosure, 3 gates, 1-5' galvanized manger\".

It is, therefore, requested that if possible a blue print of materials required or measurements by a sketch of the layout of stalls and pens could be furnished, this would help materially in the firm quoting more intelligently on the list of goods.\n\nIt is also requested that a more complete explanation be furnished in regard to item reading \"3 only combined loges 4'6\" enclosure, 20' enclosure, 3 gates, 1-5' galvanized manger\". Please advise if manger mentioned is for horse. If the above information could be furnished for the Pedlar People, I have no doubt we would receive a good quotation.\n\nAnother matter is date of delivery shown as September 10th, I am advised that delivery could not be made under something like sixty days at least\".\nIt would be appreciated if you would let me have the information required by our Purchasing Agent so that the matter can again receive his attention.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

Although navigation is now closed from Peace River to Fort Vermilion, this equipment can be shipped any time to Peace River where it will be picked up and freighted overland to Fort Vermilion. If the tenders which were called from firms in Calgary and Edmonton areas are not satisfactory, it may be advisable to deal with the Jutras Co., Ltd. at Victoriaville, P.Q., whose tender I forwarded to you. They are well acquainted with the equipment required, having the plan of the barn on hand; they are also the ones who made out the list of the material that would be required. Should you decide to buy this material from a firm in Eastern Canada, please advise me before shipping same. I will give them shipping instructions so this material can be shipped half rate, a privilege which is being granted to us by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in Montreal.

M. Vincent\n\nWe thank you for your letter of March 9th, replying to ours of February 27th, instructing us to supply your order No. 21323 in Aluminum Corrugated Sheets.\n\nThe writer has an apology to make to you relative to our letter of February 27th, which, while written on our Edmonton letterhead, the letter was sent to you while the writer was in Winnipeg, to which point the Aluminum shipment is being made, and it was from this stock arriving shortly in Winnipeg that we proposed to make shipment of your order. Our letter overlooked stating that the price quoted, namely, $1,400.67 was Sales Tax Included, F.O.B. Winnipeg. The error was noted after our letter was mailed and requested our Winnipeg office to write to you advising that the price quoted in letter of February 27th should have read as F.O.B. Winnipeg, this request due to the writer then leaving Winnipeg for the East. Apparently our correcting letter was overlooked.\n\nMay we, therefore, request your acceptance that the shipment be made as requested upon the understanding that the quotation made be F.O.B. Winnipeg, and not Edmonton as our letter would imply.\n\nMay we suggest that you wire us your acceptance at our expense.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWESTERN PRODUCTS LIMITED\n\n(sgd) A. J.

In our letter we requested your confirmation to the effect that prices submitted in our letter of February 27th were F.O.B. Winnipeg, and not F.O.B.

Under the circumstances, it would seem fair that you assume at least half the cost of the transportation charges between Winnipeg and Edmonton instead of requesting us to assume the full cost. You might give this matter your consideration as the full cost of freight would make the total cost higher than your competitor's price.\n\nI trust the matter of freight charges will not unduly delay shipment because we are anxious to pay the account by the end of our fiscal year which closes March 31st, 1948.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

Liddle, Branch Manager, pointed out to me that some necessary items for the installation of this equipment had been inadvertently omitted in the original requisition. Although I was fully aware that the purchase of these additional goods should have been referred to the Department, in order to press matters, as the fiscal year was drawing to a close, I took it for granted that the Department would approve my steps and I confirmed the order; I feel assured that the Department will understand my embarrassing situation. However, after considering the explanation given by the Departmental Officials, still think that the matter should have been referred to them before placing the order and refuse to pay the above invoices from the 1947-48 appropriation, it is hoped that they can be paid from the 1948-49 appropriation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs' Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th instant, I beg to submit the following requisition for each of the residential schools in the Grouard Diocese.\n\nRe: Fort Vermilion\n\nFather Rainville reported again and again this year that a new set of batteries was urgently required for his lighting plant. He explained that the set that he has on hand is over ten years old and the batteries are worn out. If you could arrange to secure a new set type W 21 Globelite Batteries 21 plate per cell, 56 cells for 110 volts, you would greatly relieve him. Navigation closes on the Peace River about October 1st. These batteries would therefore have to reach Peace River by then and ordered immediately. I understand that Bruce-Robinson Electric Co., Edmonton, have these batteries on hand. It would expedite matters if they were ordered from them.\n\nAt present, Father Rainville is building a horse and cow barn 124 x 36 for which the Department has defrayed the cost of equipment and corrugated aluminum for the roof. If an additional sum of $300.00 was available to pay part of the lumber and labour, I feel assured that this amount would lessen the burden of the Principal who is to be commended for the fine building that he has undertaken which will be to the credit of the Department.\n\nRe: Grouard\n\nWhen in Ottawa last January, I informed the Department that the lighting plant was destroyed by fire at Grouard on December 31st, 1947. As the school was without light and power and the matter of replacing this plant was urgent, I was asked to take the necessary steps to buy a new engine, generator and batteries upon my arrival at Edmonton. This plant was bought and is now installed.\n\nIt was explained to me that there was at that time a credit balance of some $1700. in favour of the residential schools in the Grouard Diocese from the amount provided in the estimate for 1947-48, and it was agreed that this amount would be applied to cover part of the cost of a new lighting plant for Grouard Residential School and that the balance would be paid from the estimates for 1948-49. On March 24th, 1948, I forwarded to the Department receipted invoices from Bruce Robinson Electric Limited, Edmonton, in the amount of $4687.00 for this purchase but the account has not been paid as yet. I would\nMr. Neary:\n\nappreciate this amount being reimbursed. Should you not have received the invoices, kindly let me know and I shall have additional copies made and forwarded to you.\n\nRe: Joussard\n\nThe amount of $1500.00 is required for general repairs at Joussard. Years ago buildings were constructed on wooden blocks and cement foundations should be made under these buildings in order to prevent their deterioration. If the Department is prepared to pay labour for the amount of $1500.00, the school will defray the cost of lumber, cement, nails and the balance of the labour required.\n\nRe: Sturgeon Lake\n\nAt Sturgeon Lake, a new cow and horse barn is required to replace the old dilapidated log one which threatens to cave in. It is the intention of the Principal to build this new barn in 1949. If $2000.00 were available immediately from the 1948-49 appropriation, the lumber could be bought this fall so that construction of the building may begin early in the spring of 1949, and a further amount made available from the estimates of 1948-49 to carry out the project.\n\nRe: Wabasca\n\nFather Guimont called at the Bishop's House last night and explained that the floor of some of the rooms were in very bad condition and worn out, and required to be replaced. I believe that the sum of $1500.00 would cover the cost of replacing these floors and covering them with linoleum. I shall get in touch with the Principal and ask him to let me know the amount of flooring and the number of yards of linoleum required for the job, and shall give you this information as soon as it is available. If you will arrange to have the sum of $1500.00 available for these repairs, I believe that it would cover this expenditure. I understand that the flooring could be obtained locally at Wabasca but the linoleum would have to be secured by your purchasing branch.\n\nI believe, Mr. Neary, that the above requisitions are legitimate and trust that you will give them your very careful consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

Therefore, when Bruce Robinson's account is paid, there will be no more money left to be spent on this school during the current fiscal year.\n\nThe enclosed account should, therefore, be paid by the school management.\n\nBernard F.

In your telegram of September 24th you guaranteed the difference of $625.33.

Rainville, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nFort Vermilion, Alberta.\n\nDear Father Rainville:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 1st instant regarding allowance towards the salary of the night watchman at the Vermilion Residential School, I regret that no back payment can be made to you previous to 1st April, 1948, as funds in the 1947-48 appropriation have lapsed. Naturally, we expect the Principal of the school at which an allowance for a night watchman has been authorized to forward a Voucher regularly. If he does not do so, it is presumed that he is not engaging a night watchman.\n\nIf you employed a night watchman for the month of April, 1948, and also for the months of October, November, December, 1948, and January and February, 1949, you may forward a Voucher through the office of Superintendent Lapp for six months at $60.00 per month. The Voucher should read:\n\n\"Allowance towards the salary of night watchman for the months of April, October, November, December, 1948, and January and February, 1949, six months at $60.00 per month - $360.00.\"\n\nIf you continue to employ a night watchman for the months of March and April, 1949, you may forward a Voucher at the end of each month for the same monthly amount as stated above. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to Indian Superintendent Lapp so that he will...\ncertify your Voucher and forward it to the Department for payment when he receives it from you.\n\nPlease give the matter your immediate attention, as our fiscal year closes at the end of this month.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

He was a patient in the\nlocal hospital here. He was destitute and could\nnot provide forage for his team of horses during the\ntime he was at Fort Vermilion.

H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\nMr. G. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nRe: Sports Equipment - Fort Vermilion Indian Residential School\n\nAttached hereto is a self-explanatory letter from Father G. Tetreault of the Fort Vermilion Indian Residential School.\n\nI understand from Father Tetreault that this school got a grant of $4,200.00. They have just received a new lighting plant and paint for the school. Any remaining funds from this grant will be used for some very essential and much needed kitchen equipment.\n\nThere is no question that the school here has practically no recreational equipment. If there is a special fund available for such items as sports equipment, anything you can do for us in this matter will be appreciated very much. I feel that the request made by Father Tetreault is very just.\n\nS. C. Knapp,\nSuperintendent.\nFort Vermilion Indian Residential School,\nFORT VERMILION, Alberta,\nNovember 22nd, 1949.\n\nMr. S. C. Knapp, Superintendent,\nFort Vermilion Indian Agency,\nFORT VERMILION, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Knapp:\n\nI come today to see if you could not interest or persuade your Department to accord immediately a special grant for the purchase of skates for the Indian Pupils attending our school. It seems to me that sporting activities are essential for the good health and character formation of the children; and as regards sporting equipment I believe sincerely that our school has been much less favored than numerous Indian Schools which I know of in the Province which have received substantial grants for sporting equipment and even for the erection of gymnasiums and halls.\n\nAs you no doubt remarked, I have begun a skating rink in the boys' yard this winter -- the first time a constructed rink has been undertaken in this school. However, and here is the hook, I have but twelve pairs of skates belonging to the Indian Pupils and you must admit that these are not very numerous for our enrolment. Moreover in view of our precarious financial situation at the moment I do not find the additional expense of purchasing a sufficient number of skates justifiable (a very good thing, but not essential) when the school as a whole is short of so many absolutely necessary things.\n\nI ask for very little....some ten or twelve additional pairs of skates will prove satisfactory for this winter. The children can amuse themselves and learn how to skate well this winter -- next winter will be soon enough to think of hockey equipment and organized games.\n\nHoping you will find my request reasonable and do your utmost to have it accepted by your Department, I remain,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\nFort Vermilion Indian Residential School,\nPer: (Signed)'G.

You did not state the date of his adoption and, as the boy is only three years of age, it would appear that the adoption must have taken place recently and possibly for the purpose of having the boy placed in an Indian Residential school. In view of his age, we are not prepared to approve his admission at the present time. However, if Courtoeille keeps the boy until he reaches the regular age for admission, the Department will be prepared to favorably consider placing him in a residential school at that time.\n\nFrom the information contained in your letter, we are not prepared to approve the admission of Elise, Victor and Henry Hamelin as grant earning pupils to the Indian residential school.

(Continued)\nON THE RIVER, and I consider it very fortunate that the children who were brought in arrived at Fort Vermillion without suffering some ill results.\n\n7. I would respectfully request that instructions be obtained from the Indian Department as to whether or not they require further special patrols in connection with these children. If so, it will also be necessary to arrange, either with the Mission or someone else, to transport these children to the school, as it is certain their parents cannot do so. These Indians, particularly the Red River band, are becoming increasingly more dissatisfied and reluctant to allow their children to attend school at St. Henri's at Fort Vermillion. As before stated, they are all from fifty to one hundred miles from Fort Vermillion, and particularly they are dissatisfied with the compulsory attendance of the boys. These Indians are, of necessity, bush Indians, and they claim, and rightly so, I believe, that when a boy is compelled to attend mission school until he is sixteen years of age, and then turned back into the bush, he is useless to himself or to his family, and is too old to learn bushcraft.\n\n8. I believe that the only satisfactory way in which attendance of these children at school can be enforced is for the Indian agent to take this matter up with them at Treaty time, and at that time make definite arrangements for their transportation to school prior to the commencement of the school term on September 1st. If left any later, the Indians go back into the bush for their fall hunt and later for trapping, and it is an expensive and lengthy procedure to enforce attendance in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Act. Particularly is this so in this district as so few of the Indians reside on the Reservations. I therefore request definite instructions from the Indian Department as to what procedure is desired in this connection.\n\nSTILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.\nExpense incurred.\nMileage - Hired team - 196.\n(S.L.

(Continued).\nAND THEY sent no boat. I later learned that the Indians had waited at Little Red River for five days, with their children, and then, since no one arriving to bring them to Fort Vermilion, and hearing of the epidemic or measles at this point, took their children back into the bush.\n\n4. As a result of the complaint of the Sister Superior, on December 1st I left Fort Vermilion via hired team and sleigh, and patrolled to Little Red River, accompanied by Spl/Cst. Bourassa, first making arrangements with the Mission to later send a team to bring back children. Arriving at Little Red River on December 2nd, I found that most of the Indians were off on traplines where it was impossible to get in touch with them without the expenditure of a great deal of time and money. In the Red River district I served notices on Rosalie TALLOREE, Widow TALLOREE, Joseph MERCEREAUS, and Wm. MOBERLEY. On the 5th instant I continued the patrol to the 8th Meridian and to Garden Creek, within the boundaries of the Wood Buffalo Park, where I served notices on Paulis PECHIMIEU, Michel GRANDJAMBE, and JINGEBELLS. In all these cases only the women were home, the men being all absent in the bush hunting. Returning to Little Red River on the night of December 5th, Spl/Cst. Bourassa was taken ill with measles, and it was necessary to remain at that point until the morning of December 15th, when I left Little Red River and returned to Fort Vermilion, arriving at Fort Vermilion at 12:30 a.m. on December 15th.\n\nIn the meantime teams from the Mission made the trip and brought the following children to school at Fort Vermilion: William and Ambrose, sons of Rosalie TALLOREE; Eliza, granddaughter of Widow TALLOREE; the younger son of Wm.

Of the remainder, Pierre SIEGERLAND, son of the Chief, is at Burialo River, in the North West Territories; Edwin MOBERLEY, son of Wm. MOBERLEY, is ill with measles; Elsear MOSKITE, with his family, are in the bush somewhere out from Moose Lake, exact location unknown. Narcisse DOMAS is trapping somewhere back from the Peace River, below the Wabigo Creek; Antoine KASKAMAN, with his family, is trapping somewhere in the Cariboo Mountains, within the Wood Buffalo Park, as is Paul GRANDJAMBE and his family; Johnnie GRANDJAMBE is somewhere in the Stinking River district; and Olo LOOMSKIN (Makwayan) is somewhere along the 8th meridian, towards the southwest corner of the Wood Buffalo Park. To reach these families would require, I would estimate, patrols or from three weeks to a month, with two dog teams, as it would be necessary to break trail overland to most of their camps.\n\nI would also respectfully point out that these Indians have no way of bringing their children to the Mission, many of them reside almost one hundred miles from Fort Vermilion. During my recent patrol the weather was exceptionally bad, with low temperatures, almost continual heavy snowfalls, and an unusual amount of overflow on the river.\n\n(Continued on page 3)\n\nIndian Affairs.

Further to the above and with particular reference to paragraph 2 of my report of September 17th last, on November 5th, whilst on patrol in the district where HABITANT (APPELLED) lives, I called at his home and found that the whole family was suffering from measles. They appeared to be recovering and I warned HABITANT with regard to the placing of his children in the mission as soon as he was recovered sufficiently to do so. HABITANT agreed to this, but said he would bring them in as soon as he and the children were fit to travel. These children not having been brought in, I made enquiries of John BOUHASSA, mail courier, on the 16th instant, and he informed me that he had called at HABITANT'S shack on his way to Fort Vermilion with the mail and had found the whole family very ill, and almost out of food. Rations were forwarded to this man by BOUHASSA by Dr. H.A. Hamman, Indian Department representative here. It is now doubted whether these children will be brought into school as it is certain that the father will be in no condition to bring them for some time.\n\nSub-Division 17-23-27\n\nDetachment\n\nP.C.R.\n\n17-9-27\n\n2.

With regard to the children from the Red River district, whilst at Little Red River on September 22nd and 23rd last, knowing that these children should be in school, I arranged with the Indians to have their children at the Upper Landing, Vermillion Chutes, on October 1st, and on returning to Fort Vermilion arranged for the mission to send a boat down for them, as they have no means of their own to come to Fort Vermillion. However, at that time there was an epidemic of measles at the mission, with all the children and staff being ill, and they\n\nFile numbers must be quoted\n\nIndian Affairs.

P.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 8, 1936.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a lengthy report from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with reference to action taken in returning pupils to the Vermilion Indian Residential School. This report reads in part as follows:\n\n\"These Indians, particularly the Red River Band, are becoming increasingly more dissatisfied and reluctant to allow their children to attend school at the Mission at Fort Vermilion. As before stated, they are all from fifty to one hundred miles from Fort Vermilion. Particularly are they dissatisfied with the compelling of the attendance of the boys. These Indians are, of necessity, bush Indians, and they claim, and rightly so, I believe, that when a boy is compelled to attend mission school until he is sixteen years of age, and then turned back into the bush, he is useless to himself or to his family, and is too old to learn bushcraft.\n\n\"I believe that the only satisfactory way in which attendance of these children at school can be enforced is for the Indian Agent to take this matter up with them at Treaty time, and at that time make definite arrangements for their transportation to school prior to the commencement of the school term on September 1st. If left any later, the Indians go back into the bush for their fall hunt, and later for trapping, and it is an expensive and lengthy procedure to enforce attendance in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Act. Particularly is this so in this district as so few of the Indians reside on the Reservations. I therefore request definite instructions from the Indian Department as to what procedure is desired in this connection.\"\n\nRev. F. S. Lajoie, O.M.I.,\nAdministrator,\nDiocese of Grouard,\nGrouard, Alta.\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police are being informed that no further action toward returning children to the Vermilion School may be taken at the present time.\n\nThe statement of the Police that the parents are dissatisfied with the compulsion being used in keeping the boys in school until 16 years of age raises a question which has been discussed for some time, especially with the Right Reverend G. Breynat, O.M.I., in regard to the schools in the Northwest Territories. As the living conditions of the Little Red River Band of Indians are practically the same as those in the Northwest Territories it is felt that the same regulations should apply to them as apply to the Indians in the Northwest Territories. These are as follows:\n\n1. The age limit for discharge of boys to be 14 years and girls 16 years.\n\n2. Boys, upon reaching 12 years of age, if in good physical condition, may be granted leave of absence each year for the period during the hunting and trapping season and thereafter returned to school. This arrangement to be continued in their case until they reach the full age of 14 years, when they are to be discharged.\n\n3. Girls, in special cases, if considered in their interests, may be permitted, upon request of the Principal of the School and the local Agent, or other departmental representative, to remain until they reach the age of 18 years. The reasons, in such cases, should be forwarded to the Department concerned and permission obtained for girls to remain a further period after reaching the age of 16 years, but not beyond the age of 18 years.\n\n4. In the case of orphan and destitute children, Principals of schools and local departmental representatives should arrange to have them placed, upon their discharge, with families who will properly care for them and provide for their future welfare and also arrange, in the case of boys 12 to 14 years of age, to be placed with a family in order that they can acquire a knowledge of hunting and trapping.\nIt may be possible that the above conditions should also apply to other children attending the Vermilion Residential School or to the Indian Residential Schools in the Diocese of Grouard.\n\nI feel certain that you will realize the reasonableness of these regulations and will co-operate with the Department in putting them into effect. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Principal of the Vermilion Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nGrouard, Alta., Feb. 21st, 1938.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAnswering yours of the 8th inst., I have to state that I will do my best to cooperate with the Department for the welfare of Indian children. As your letter touches many important problems, my intention is to have it carefully studied by the Board of Administration of the Vicariate of Grouard. The Residential Indian School of Fort Vermilion being especially concerned, I am requesting the observations the Principal may have to make.\n\nLet me express you my first impression. While admitting the necessity of preparing the Indian boys to their future life, bush life as you say, I can't refrain from making a remark: What would be the use of training youngsters to trapping and fishing if there is to be no more fur or fish. Surely, you have been told that the situation for the Indians is becoming alarming. One has to see to understand what it means. The fact is this: wild life has nearly disappeared in the North due to the fact that white people have been allowed to enter the wilderness. White trappers and fishermen, having no lively interest in the preservation of fur, game or fish kill and catch as much as they can. They use the airplane to invade the remotest sanctuaries where wild life is reproduced. They annihilate rats' and beavers' families; they empty lakes and rivers from any valuable fish and they go further when there is nothing left in their first fields of operation. The natives have to stay and make a living in the country.\n\nThere is a remedy, drastic but the only one effective. It would be to close the North Country to White trappers and fishermen. The small loss of revenue produced by the sale of licenses to white people would be largely compensated not only by the saving of relief but especially by keeping the Indians busy. Laziness is bad for white people; it is mortal for Indians.\n\nThe problem is serious enough that every man in responsibility should stick at and bring his share to find an adequate settlement. It is useless to work against nature. The Indians of the North are bush Indians as you say; let the bush be habitable for them and they will make a living.\n\nThe reports on trapping are discouraging. No fur at all; hardly a few moose. What will happen next summer? Most of the families will not have a nickel to buy clothes and food. And it will be worse in the coming years unless drastic measures are adopted to protect and reconstitute the source of wild life. This can be performed by reserving trapping and fishing to Indians.\n\nExcuse me, Sir, if I have kept you so long on our main problem here.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(sgd.) F. S.

School,\nFort Vermilion, Alta.,\nMarch 23, 1938\n\nMr. R.M. Hoey,\nSub. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received a copy of the letter concerning the Indians of Little Red River and their dissatisfaction at being compelled to send their children to the school at Fort Vermilion. This letter, File No. 431-13-10, was addressed to Rev. F.S. Lajoie, Administrator of Grouard, also the Regulations to be followed in future regarding the age limit for the discharge of the pupils of this school, for all of which I wish to thank you.\n\nWe have always had considerable difficulty with the school attendance in this district, due to the fact that there is no resident Agent near to the school. Mr. L'Heureux, our Agent resides some 400 miles from here, and partly too, because the school is so far from some of the Reserves from which our pupils come.\n\nThese Reserves are the Little Red River, 60 miles, and the Tall Cree Reserve 45 miles, for the Crees. The Slaves are not as yet constituted into reserves. They are at Hay River, 90 miles, and at Hay Lakes, 125 miles. The pupils from this district that we have are mostly orphan or destitute children. The two Beaver Reserves of Eleske, 24 miles, and Boyer River, 12 miles, present little difficulty as far as distance is concerned, the point to be gained with them is to have all the pupils of school age brought to school for the opening of classes, September 1st. The Beavers can and usually do bring in the children, but never for the first day.\n\nIt is the more distant pupils of Tall Cree and Red River who give us most trouble. It was for this reason that we appealed for assistance to Constable Grayson this year. Would it not be possible for some arrangement to be made, as he suggested in this report, through Mr. L'Heureux, at Treaty time, that the Indian Department do something about this matter? At Grouard and at Joussard the pupils are brought to the school by their parents, or if difficulty arises, by the Agent, or some one, authorized by him, I believe. Could not some such arrangement be made for us? If so, it will be greatly appreciated, and will do much to eliminate a good deal of the trouble we have each year in September.\nIt is true that the Red River Indians are not satisfied with the present arrangement of affairs. They say it is because the school is so far from them and they cannot see their children from September until June. And I believe too, they do not like to be urged too much to put the children in school. But since the boys are to be discharged at 14 years hereafter, that should encourage them to send in the younger children. That is the difficulty to get in the children at 7 years.\n\nThese Indians of Red River and the Slaves of the Hay Lakes and Hay River district have repeatedly asked at Treaty time that the Agent and the priest in charge speak to the proper authorities concerned in their favour, about having a school in or near their reserves, then assuring us that they would send in their children willing, as they would then be able to visit them from time to time, but they find the school at Fort Vermilion too far away from their homes. This is a very legitimate proposition, and worthy of consideration by the civil and religious authorities.\n\nI will greatly appreciate any assistance you may be able to give us in these matters.\n\nTruly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A previous application was made to the Department on October 23, 1937 which you refused per your 131-13-10 of December 16, 1937. Additional information now submitted indicates close relationship to full-fledged non-treaty Indians. This family is from Little Red River.\n\nRe: Frederick Hamelin. - This is a first application. His case is similar to the preceding one.\n\nRe: Alice and Daniel Hodgson. - There is no indication that these children are Indians; informations given would rather tend to show that this is a case for the Officer of the Neglected Children Branch of the Provincial Department of Public Health to whom the Principal of the school should apply for grant.\n\nI enclose herewith with the applications for the above the letter of the Principal covering same.\n\nWill you kindly let me have your decision as to their admission.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN. P. L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nNovember 8, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th ultimo enclosing applications and certificates of health for the admission of Victor and Henry Hamelin, Frederick Hamelin and Alice and Daniel Hodgson to the Vermilion Indian Residential School.\n\nFrom the information contained in your letter the Department does not consider that these children are eligible for admission and grant earning pupils to an Indian Residential School. Consequently it will not be possible to allow per capita grant for them. In this case also I would again direct your attention to the ruling contained in official letter of December 10, 1937, copy of which is enclosed. What has been said regarding applications for admission of halfbreeds to the Sturgeon Lake School applies also in the case of the Vermilion and other Residential Schools in your Agency. The Department trusts that the Principals will carefully review circular letter of December 10, 1937, and confine their recruiting efforts to treaty Indian children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nN.F. L'Heureux, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nNovember 12, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI received your letter of the 4th ultimo enclosing account covering the cost of transportation of children to and from the Fort Vermilion Residential School during the past summer.\n\nThe account amounted to $169.00 but as the amount available for travelling expenses is very limited and as no special provision was made for the Vermilion Residential School due to the fact that you did not apply to the Department for authority to incur such expenses it was only found possible to allow an amount of $100.00, a cheque for which amount is going forward to the Principal of the Vermilion Residential School.\n\nI note that the account included charges of $57.00 for transporting children from the school to Red River. Would it not have been possible to have the parents come for the children? It should not be necessary to transport children both ways as the parents should show sufficient interest in the children to either come for them at the beginning of the holidays or return them at the close.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Father HUGERRE, Fort Vermilion, Alta.,\nCompl. of TRUANT INDIAN CHILDREN.\n\nHeadquarters\n\n1. The above named came to this office at noon of the 2-10-39, to notify that the following twenty Indian children had been missing from the St. Henry Mission School since 9 AM of that morning: Ambrose TALL CREE, Gabriel MINIE, and Ernest AUGER. These boys, aged 12, 11, and 9 years, respectively, had failed to answer the Breakfast Roll-Call and had last been seen in the school yard just prior to 9 AM. TALL CREE and MINIE both come from the Tall Cree Reserve, 60 miles south of this point, and where their parents are residing. The AUGER boy's home is near Little Red River, which is 65 miles east of Fort Vermilion, on the Peace River. There was no immediate information as to where these boys may have gone.\n\nSub-Division\n\n2. Investigation disclosed that the missing lads very probably had run away from School and would attempt to reach their homes. Since they are very young it was urgent that they be located as soon as possible, due to the danger of their becoming lost, or being drowned in the River. The road to the Tall Cree reserve is a bush trail for about 60 miles and then the road reaches the Tall Cree Prairie. This is a very isolated district, the road is seldom travelled and no one lives on or near it. At 5 PM of the same day I was hired locally, and I sent S/Gst. Bourassa to investigate along this trail to make an effort to locate any of these lads travelling on foot. He was instructed to make every effort to locate tracks and should any be found follow and apprehend and return the boys.\n\nP.C.R.\n\nPt. Ver. First.\n\n3. Several years ago, several Truant boys attempted to escape from the school by stealing a canoe and floating down river to Little Red River. After a careful check of all settlements for any stolen canoe or boat, and also searched the surrounding district for these boys. Since S/Gst. Bourassa did not return late PM, I presumed that he had found signs along the Tall Cree Reserve road and was following. He returned the following day with TALL CREE, MINIE and AUGER, that he had overtaken them about 32 miles from here, having covered this distance in 24 hours. He reported that the Lower River was in flood stage and he met extreme difficulty in crossing, but the boys were suffering from hunger and exposure, having become thoroughly soaked crossing so he built a fire and rested a few hours during which Bourassa stated that they were in some danger, as the reserve has recently been burned over and the brush is very thick.\n\n4. On this date I interviewed a thorough warning not to repeat this attempt.\n\nFyle numbers must be quoted.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Con't (I also) discussed with Father HUGERRE the question of preventing further attempts by any of the children to run away from the school. I suggested that a more careful watch be maintained during the recess periods, and if it was necessary, a more frequent Roll-Call when the children are gathered in large groups.\n\n5. I wish to respectfully draw attention to the sense of responsibility and efficiency displayed by S/Ost. Bourassa on this case. His natural ability to follow tracks and his determination not to overtake these boys before they reached the open prairie, did much to effect their safe return. On the return trip it was necessary for him to give them food as they had not eaten for 26 hours and were in an exhausted condition.

Hamman, Fort Vermilion, dated January 20th, 1940.\n\nMore and more children are being brought into the school (Fort Vermilion Residential) in accordance with your instructions that various adults will lose ration rights if their children or grandchildren are not placed therein. Accommodation is taxed to the utter limit and more are coming. Not a single cot is now available. But, more important, the health of all is going to be seriously affected if more are entered as the cubic air space of dormitories and school rooms is already asked to do too much to keep up a steady amount of fresh air for all. The Mission will have to enlarge its premises if the school population grows very much more. The Mission authorities have not mentioned the matter to me in this strain. I do know any further influx should be stopped at once. There is however, one child, a girl, daughter of Julie Toby, now in hospital, that I would like to place in school as soon as she is well, as she was a pitifully wasted spectacle when she arrived - also her mother is a ne'er do well.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) H. A. Hamman.\nSir:\n\nThe following letter has been received from Mr. N. P. L'Heureux, Indian Agent, Driftpile:\n\n\"File 5-121. Driftpile, Alta., January 24th, 1940.\n\n\"Dear Sir:\n\n\"I beg to enclose herewith excerpt copy of a letter received this day from Dr. Hamman regarding the overcrowded conditions at the Fort Vermilion R.C. Residential School.\n\n\"I have communicated with Rev. Father Lajoie regarding same and have suggested to him the release of non-Indian pupils who are in residence and for whom school grant is paid by our Department. Father Lajoie said that they are very few and will not suffice to meet the conditions complained of by Doctor Hamman.\n\n\"He has suggested, in addition, the removal to Grouard Residential School, of all Indian pupils who are orphans and without near relatives. There are six or seven pupils in that class.\n\n\"One class room will be freed for our Indian pupils next spring when the Fort Vermilion School District move to their own building.\n\n\"Additional dormitory space will be available when the hospital is constructed. It is a matter of time.\n\n\"For your information I will add that there are 88 pupils enrolled at that school on December 31st last. (Quota 65).\n\n\"Father Lajoie has requested to communicate to His Lordship Bishop Langlois, presently in Ottawa, 600 Cumberland Street, the excerpt of Doctor Hamman's letter. I am therefore forwarding same to him, together with a copy of this letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) \"E.J.GALIBOIS\"\n\nfor N. P.

Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 6, 1940.\n\nDear Bishop Langlois:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Inspector Schmidt in which he states that he has received a letter from Indian Agent L'Heureux regarding a report of Dr. H. A. Hamman. The latter states that there is very serious overcrowding at the Vermilion Indian Residential School and as a result there is not sufficient cubic air space in the dormitories and class rooms to accommodate the number of children in residence.\n\nI know you realize the seriousness of overcrowding a residential school and consequently it is hoped that immediate arrangements will be made to discharge certain pupils in order that there may be sufficient air space for those that remain.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nHt. Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Grouard,\nGrouard, Alta.\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nMay I add a few words about that famous Vocational School at St-Augustine. I have received no help so far, but it will be impossible for me to keep it open for a very much longer period of time. I'll be very sorry if I have to close it, because it is doing good to the ten girls attending it, and it would be such a boon for all our girls to follow that post-graduate course.\n\nI am asking you what you intend to do and what help you expect to be able to give me next Fall, because I'll have to come to some decision before the month of June.\n\nWith my best personal regards,\n\n+ M. Ranglois, O.M.I.\nBishop's Residence\nGrouard, Alberta\nFeb. 15 - 1940\n\nMr. Hoey,\nDirector of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your letter of Feb. 6, 1931-18-10.\n\nThe complaints made by Dr. Newman caused me to write immediately to Father Principal at Fort Vermillion about the apparent serious situation developing at his School. Be sure, Father Bureuerr will remedy that overcrowding condition as soon as possible. I cannot understand how things happened, unless many children have come all at once from the Little Red River.\n\nAs we know, it is known that the number of Indian children is increasing everywhere, and this should be considered as the most eloquent and irrefutable plea in favor of the excellent work done by the Residential Schools for the rehabilitation of the Indian tribes. At the same time, this increase in number creates new conditions in our schools; some of them have to be replaced without delay, because tottering and entirely lacking modern accommodations as it is the case at Sturgeon Lake, others have to be emptied of all other social services which until now had been sheltered therein, as it is the case at Fort Vermillion where a small hospital has occupied for years a good portion of floor-space.\n\nIt is perfectly evident that the existing possible floor-space of the School must be from this consecrated to house our Indian children only. This will be done, I hope, in the near future, if the Department gives me a little helping hand.\n\nFirst, in connection with the class rooms, the situation will be remedied next summer by the building of a separate school of 2 class rooms for Breed pupils, so that the existing class rooms will be exclusively used for our Indian children. A concrete foundation has been already put in this Fall and the new separate school should be finished early next Spring.\n\nSecondly, the dormitories will certainly give ample cubic air per child in residence, when the space occupied by the Hospital is restored to the School children. I am working on a report I promised Mr. Jackson on the hospitalization problem at Fort Vermillion.\n\nThe need for a Hospital in that locality is evident and pressing. There is 1000 Indians in the District and the closest Hospital at hands is that of Peace River, 200 miles south by plane. We did our best, in the circumstances, to alleviate the situation and, as there was ample room at the time in our Residential School building, a portable ward on the floor was placed in which has been used since as a temporary Hospital, where two and often more nurses are on constant duty.\n\nNow, the number of children having increased and the hospital accommodations having become inadequate, it is time something is done and a modern Hospital of about 15 beds is built.\n\nWith this end in view, I had a sketch prepared and I intend to ask the Hon. Minister, through his Secretary Mr. Jackson, for a grant of at least 50% of the total cost of the building. Dear Mr. Hoey, I know you can do much to assure the success of this scheme and I am sure that you will help me, as I have written you at each length and end this letter praying you to intercede in favor of the immediate construction of this much needed Hospital at Fort Vermillion, so that the sick people of the District may receive the proper care to which they are entitled, and at the same time no School age children be deprived of education.\n\nWith my best personal regards,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6377, file 766-10, part 2)\nOttawa,\nFebruary 27, 1940.\n\nDear Bishop Langlois:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant and have carefully noted its contents.\n\nOwing to the dissolution of Parliament you will realize that it is impossible for me at the present time to state what funds will be available in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41.

This boy, Jimmie Collin, is a pupil of the Fort Vermilion school, but is very anxious to follow his sister to this school. The Principal there agrees with me that it would be an act of kindness to allow them to remain together, instead of parting them. For this reason, I am asking your authorization to proceed with the request for discharge of Jimmie from the Ft.

In reply the Principal states that it has not been possible to keep the expenses within the limit of the amount of $65.00 authorized as heavy rains throughout the season have made trails very heavy and slowed down considerably their means of transport.\n\nI recommend therefore that if the whole amount is available that payment of the account at $112.00 be paid.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nN.

Please advise regarding this girl.\n\nPupils 213, 0169 and 0171 are 15 years of age or over. The Principal should either apply through your office for their discharge or should request permission to keep them for a longer period. In the latter event definite reasons should be stated for wishing to take such action.\n\nThe names of the pupils numbered as follows have appeared on the returns for the last three quarters but do not appear to have been in the school for any part of that time:\n\n| No. 174 | No. 0175 |\n|---------|----------|\n| \"181\"   | \"0195\"   |\n| \"203\"   | \"0196\"   |\n| \"208\"   | \"0202\"   |\n| \"210\"   | \"0203\"   |\n| \"215\"   | \"0206\"   |\n| \"222\"   | \"0207\"   |\n| \"0168\"  | \"0213\"   |\n\nApparently these pupils are absent for various reasons and the Principal should apply for their discharge. If at any time in the future it is desired to re-admit them, application for such re-admission can be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This account is being paid. However, I would point out that we previously received from you voucher 108 for $32.50. This makes a total amount of $197.00 that we are allowing for transportation to and from the Vermilion School during the summer of 1942. In 1941 we paid your voucher No. 445 amounting to $112.00. In 1940 we paid voucher 414 for $118.00. You will, therefore, see that the expenditure in this particular regard is being allowed to increase and in no case has the Principal applied for authority before incurring the expenditure. You should advise him immediately that we will not be in a position to pay any further expenses for transportation of children during the current academic year at this school and, as far as the summer of 1943 is concerned, you should write to us early in June stating the probable expense that the Principal wishes to incur for transportation and it will then be decided what amount, if any, can be allowed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. N.P.

L'Heureux, Indian Agent, Driftpile, Alta.\n\nThe December quarter return of the Vermilion Residential School shows a large number of pupils absent without authority. Conditions at this school appear to be similar to Sturgeon Lake and Grouard about which I am writing you in concurrent letters. It is evident that a number of children were allowed home on holidays in June and have not yet returned. In such cases their return will only be obtained by full co-operation between the Principal of the school and our agency officials. I trust that you will co-operate with the Principal immediately in having the absentees returned.\n\nAn application should be forwarded for Charles Fournier, No. 235.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMission Saint-Henri\nFort Vermilion, Alta.\nCanada\nFort Vermilion Indian School\nMarch 9, 1943\n\nMr. N.P. L'Heureux, Indian Agent\nDriftpile, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter here inclosed, dated November 30, 1942, here is a rough estimate of the expenses for the transportation of the children to and from the Fort Vermilion School.\n\nI-For transportation TO Fort Vermilion School:\nThere are two groups of children we must pick up every fall: one from Reserve no. 162, the other from Reserve no. 173.\n\n1-From Reserve 162, at Red River, there are 25 to 35 children coming to our school. This reserve is 75 milles down the Peace River; and to reach the Reserve we have to go over 12 milles portage at Fort Vermilion Chutes. Moreover in the early fall many families are out in the woods in quest of their living. In those circumstances the round trip will take seven days:\n\na-A freighter with his own boat will not make that trip for less than $50.00. $50.00\nb-We estimate that the care and food for one child are at cost $.50 per day; for 30 children with an average of 3 days care for each child: $45.00. 45.00\nc-trip east of the same Reserve by Sping lake, Stinking River, Moose Lake; four days with a guide and his horse; at $5.00 per day: $20.00 20.00\n\n2-From Reserve 173. This Reserve is 75 milles south of Fort Vermilion. The means of communication is a very bad summer trail.\n\na-The round trip will take at least 6 days at $6.00 per day for the team and the driver: $36.00 36.00\nb-The care & food for 8 children at $1.50 12.00\n\nII-For transportation FROM Fort Vermilion School:\nTo return home the children it is much easier because their parents have some money on hand in the spring with the closing of the trapping season and they come often half way to meet us, generally at Fort Vermilion Chutes. In these circumstances, to return home the children the total expense should not exceed $40.00 40.00\n\nTotal....... $203.00\nThen the total amount required for the transportation of the children to and from Fort Vermilion School would be about $203.00.\n\nIf during the past years those expenses were lower it is only because the missionary, who was using his own boat, did not charge his time and the use of his boat; but when we travel with the Hudson Bay Company's boat or any body else's boat, we must pay the fare and this expense have to be figured out in the total estimate.\n\nHoping that the Department will take in favorable consideration our request,\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. B. Rainville, O.M.I.\nDept. Mines and Resources, Ind. Affairs Branch, OTTAWA, Ont.,\n\nI have attached hereto a report from Rev. Father Rainville, O.M.I; the principal of the Fort Vermilion (R.C.) mission. This is a reply that Father Rainville has sent to the letter of Mr. Phelan of the 28-10-42 under the above file heading and I am sending it to the Dept. for the information of the Branch concerned.\n\nN.F. L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 1, 1943.\n\nMr. H. P. L'Heureux, Indian Agent, Driftpile, Alberta.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, enclosing communication from the Principal of the Vermilion Residential School with reference to the cost of transporting children to and from the school.\n\nThe funds at our disposal will not permit our paying the total cost of transportation of children to and from residential schools throughout the Dominion. Consequently, at all schools we only allow a portion of the cost. In view of the size of the Vermilion Residential School, it is felt that an allowance of $150.00 is reasonable. Consequently, you should inform the Principal that the Department will allow, for the year 1943, an amount of $150.00 towards the cost of transportation of the children. Payment of this amount will be made upon receipt, from you, of the usual voucher, to which you should attach receipts showing expenditures made by the Principal, to an amount not exceeding that stated above.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nApplications not forwarded for 235 - Chas.

L'Heureux, Indian Agent, Driftpile, Alta.\n\nWith reference to the March quarter return of the Vermilion Residential School, please forward an application form for Charles Fournier, No. 235.\n\nOn the December and March quarter returns of this school there are shown the names of 19 pupils for whom no grant is requested. We wrote to you regarding these in official letter of January 23. Please let me know what action you have taken to co-operate with the Principal in having these pupils returned. An immediate reply in this regard would be appreciated.\n\nAccording to our records pupils numbered as follows are 16 years of age or over:\n\nNo. 178    No. 0187\n\" 213    \" 0188\n\nIf the Principal is not applying for their discharge at the end of June, application should be made for permission to retain them and at this time reasons should be stated for wishing this action taken.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Truant Indian Children - Fort Vermilion Residential School\n\nReference your letters January 23rd, and April 15th. The pupils showing as absentees on the School Quarterly Returns are all, with the exception of a few listed in this letter, from Little Red River Reserve and the parents absolutely refused to send them back to school last September, giving for reasons the long distance and the high cost to go and see their children at Fort Vermilion.\n\nThe Department is no doubt aware of the distance and particularly of the difficulties existing on the road between Fort Vermilion and Little Red River. From Ft. Vermilion to the Chutes the trip is being made by boat, then about 15 miles by horses and to reach the Indians' homes several modes of transportation have to be used; horse back, canoe, etc., and the cost of a full trip is excessive. If you refer to reports submitted by the Fort Vermilion Mission in connection with trips taken to recruit the Red River school children in the past years you will have be in a better position to understand the situation.\n\nThe mission made three trips last Fall but with very little success, even with the co-operation of the Chief who has a great deal of influence over his band, but they have not been able to convince the Indians to release their children. When visiting this Reserve at Treaty time I generally make it a point to emphasize the necessity of sending their children to school, knowing their attitude, but all this has very little bearing on them, and the only solution I can see to this problem is the law, and I will not take steps unless instructed by the Indian Department to do so.\n\nThe following are the few pupils who are absent for some valid reasons:\n\n0232 M. Rose Auger - Ticket No. 70 Ft. Vermilion. Family non-Indian.\n0237 Henriette Nooksiye - Non-Treaty.\n0231 Madeleine Nooksiye - Non-Treaty.\n281 Mr. Freeman - Ticket No. 227 Upper Hay River. Too far to go back to Ft. Vermilion.\n174 Ambroise Tall Cree - Ticket No. 41 Ft. Vermilion. Family residing at Little Red River.\n195 Julien Adekat - Ticket No. 79 Hoyer River Reserve.

Whilst at Fort Vermilion in August of this year I discussed this matter with the Principal of the School, Rev. Father Rainville. The facts are:\n\nNo. 0188 was born on 20-3-27. She was 16 in March of this year. The age at the date she entered school for the Fall term is carried on the records until the following June. She entered in Sept. 1942 and was 15 years old then and this age is still shown in June.\n\nNo. 0187. Was born in Feb. 1927. Same as No. 0188\n\nNo. 178 Was Born Mar. 1927\n\nNo. 213 Was born 17-3-26. The Principal wrote to the Department on 25-9-42 requesting special authority to keep this boy in school. He is an orphan.\n\nIn the above connection I wish to advise that the Treaty Lists show the above named children as being older than 16 years in the first three cases and No. 213 is shown as 18. However these census ages were supplied by the parents in many cases and cannot be considered accurate. I went into this matter very closely with Father Rainville.\n\nW.B. Skead,\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 28, 1943.\n\nThe Acting Indian Agent, Driftpile, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the ages of certain pupils in the Vermilion Residential School. I note that No. 213 is now over 17 years of age and will reach his 18th birthday on March 17, 1944. He should be discharged from the school before that date. There should be no difficulty in his obtaining employment, due to the demand for manpower at the present time.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nFort Vermilion, Alta., Sept. 1st 1943\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into\nthe Fort Vermilion Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child Louis Courtoireille\nEnglish name\nAge 8\nName of Band Fort Vermilion Band\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid no. 56\nFather's full name and No John Courtoireille no. 56\nMother's full name and No Christine Moberly no. 56\nParents living or dead Both Living\nState of child's health Good\nReligion Roman Catholic\nDoes applicant speak English?

It was learned the opening date for the mission school was 1-9-47, this for registration and placement, that school classes would begin 5-9-47, therefore it was important that all children be on hand in time for classes.\n\n(3) At 11 AM, 31-8-47, via hired car patrol was made to Stony Point district where A.Mizotte was hired as interpreter, and with him patrol continued to the Eleskie (Child Lake) Indian Reserve where the chief, councillors and parents were warned of the school opening and advised to have their children report accordingly.\n\n(4) Patrol also covered the Bulldog Reserve where the same warning was issued, returning to Pt.Vermillion where scattered families were contacted and warned of the opening date. Posters supplied by the Mission advising all children over the age of 7 years and under 16 years to attend were posted in strategic places for the information of all who could read and pass the word to others.\n\n(5) Patrol returned to detachment at 7-30 PM same date, advising the Mission of district covered.\n\n(6) On the 1-9-47 Fr.Rainville called at this detachment stating he expected no further trouble with absentee's as they were arriving at the Mission as instructed, and requesting Indians reporting for rations from outlying points be checked as to the school attendance of their children.

It is noted that these girls were sent by air.\n\nOur records indicate that these girls were only fourteen years of age and in Grade V. Why was it apparently considered necessary to send them in the middle of the term? Would it not have been possible to defer their transfer until the end of June?\n\nI would like to point out that owing to its cost we want to avoid as far as possible, moving children by air. If the transfer had been delayed until the end of June, their transportation would not likely have been necessary.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from you in the matter. In the meantime, payment of the account will be withheld.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nRev. R. Rainville, C.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Vermilion Res.

Neary  \nSuperintendent of Education  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYP: 131-13-10 (E.1)\n\nIn reply to your letter dated March the 23rd regarding the transportation of two girls to the Manual Training School at Grouard, I beg to advise as follows:\n\nAlbina Kidney is 16 years of age as she is born in November 1931. -- Albina Adekat will be 15 years of age; she is born in April 1933.\n\nThese two girls in my opinion were well prepared to profit by the special course given at Grouard's School. Both of them were glad to leave their relatives for the sake of a better education, but Albina Kidney would not have accepted to go alone; so for the sake of giving the older girl a better education, I thought I was justified to send with her a companion that was able to profit by the course.\n\nIt is true that I could have waited for the River Transportation and then cut in half the transportation costs.... At the end of December, Indian Superintendent Walker requested that I should take in the school the Beaulieu's family, Uppa Ha River Band no. 226, orphans, the mother had died few days before. As I had not a bed vacant my only alternative was to discharge older pupils. Helen Attillon (16 years old) was discharged and returned home; and the two mentioned girls were immediately transferred to Grouard and I wrote immediately to the Department for approval.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

It is presumed that these pupils have completed their academic work and left for home before the end of June.\n\nThe practice followed by the Department for cases of this nature is to claim full grant on the June Quarter and make the adjustment on the September Quarter, for it is probable that the pupils who left the residence early might return early and this would make it impossible to adjust on the return.\n\nPlease adjust the attached return accordingly and return. In the meantime we are forwarding you a part payment of $4,000.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT SCHOOL DURING QUARTER, 19\n\n| No. | Name | Band | State of Education | Date of Admission | On Discharge |\n|-----|------|------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|\n|     |      |      |                   |                  |             |\n\n**DISCHARGE OF PUPILS**\n\n| No. | Name | Band | State of Education | Date of Discharge | Remarks Upon Discharge |\n|-----|------|------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------|\n|     |      |      |                   |                  |                       |\n\n**NOTE:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He states that the above noted vouchers cannot be found.\n\nWhen we wrote our letter of August 30th, we did not list the vote and allotment numbers of the vouchers. In the case of Voucher No. 247, it is 516-03-311. In the case of Voucher No. 266, payable to John Ward, it is 516-13-491. We are now wondering if our failure to quote the allotment and vote numbers may have caused some confusion and if our letter was given to Colonel Jones in error as we believe the vouchers would be sent to your office for your approval. At Colonel Jones' suggestion, we have made out duplicates of the vouchers and have attached our file copy of the accounts. Would you please check this matter for us as the men are very anxious about their money as both are badly in need of it.\n\nP.S. Since writing this letter, John Ward came into the office and states he has now received his cheque.\n\nS. C.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nNovember 23, 1950.\n\nRev. Paul Serrand,\nFort Vermilion Indian Res. School,\nFort Vermilion, Alta.,\n\nI have your September Quarterly Return.\n\nOn checking this return it is noted that you are showing a number of pupils who have been out of residence for one reason or another, in some cases up to three years. This practice is not satisfactory as the return shows there is a larger number of pupils in residence than actually enrolled.\n\nIt is suggested, therefore, that you apply to the Department by Form I.A. 411 for the approval of the discharge of all pupils who, in your estimation are not returning to school at all or those who will probably not return within the next six months.\n\nIn the event of any pupils returning after being discharged you will be obliged to secure authority from the Department to re-admit them. You will note that you show the enrolment at the school to be 119 pupils while the average is 76. You can see the discrepancy.\n\nOn your September Admission and Discharge Form you have shown that thirteen children have been admitted to the school for institutional care. On checking our files, it is noted that no applications for the admission of these children have been received in this office, consequently their admittance to the school has not been approved. Technically, the Department is not obliged\nto allow per capita grant on children whose admission to school has not been approved. However, we will allow the September grant on the understanding that the applications for admission will be received shortly.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**DEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 1950 | Dec. 6 To transportation from Fort Vermilion to Little Red River of thirty-eight Treaty Indian Children (pupils of the Fort Vermilion Indian Residential School) returning home for the summer holidays - as per acct. attached. | $70.00 |\n\nWe consider this to be a very reasonable charge for the transportation of these children (by boat).\n\n**SEVENTY and 00/100 DOLLARS**\n\n---\n\n**FOR USE BY INDIAN SUPERINTENDENT**\n\nVoucher No. 500 Date: Dec. 6, 1950\n\nP.O.

Also attached are Application for Admission forms.\n\nYou will note that a great number of these forms are not signed by the parents. I would like to point out the difficulties encountered in getting the children to school. In the fall of the year the Indians of this Agency are scattered throughout the bush on moose hunts and the problem of getting the children in to school always has been a difficult one. This year I put the onus on the Chiefs and Councillors. They rounded up the children and brought them to school. As the Chiefs and Councillors cannot read or write, it would be very difficult for them to take a set of forms and obtain signatures. Therefore, I would assume that if the Chief or Councillor brought in the children, they came with the parents' consent.\n\nIt will be physically impossible to get a lot of these forms signed before the spring. I am therefore sending them in without the signatures of the parents. I feel that if we ask the Chief and Councillors to bring in the children and we then tax their efforts by giving them a lot of forms to sign which they do not understand, we may run into difficulties. I would therefore ask you to accept them as they are.

Her mother, Mrs. Sophie Chambaud, is a patient at the Camsell Hospital and will remain under treatment. Her father, Josie Chambaud is a suspected case of T.B. who has resisted the x-ray, and for which reason Dr. Falconer does not want Rose to return home.\n\nThe Fort Vermillion Residential School is unable to cope with all the children of school age in that area. We are therefore suggesting that she be sent to the Croward School where there are already a number of children (non-Indian) of under school age.\n\nMay we have your opinion on this suggestion, please?\n\nL.

In view of the contents of your letter, I do not consider that any further payment is due Jean Courtoiselle.\n\nWith particular reference to the second last paragraph of your letter, I feel that it would be inadvisable to threaten the Indians with a statement to the effect that if they do not send their children to school, their Family Allowances will be stopped.\n\nI feel very definitely that you should confine your efforts at the present time to insisting on having all children of school age attend school. If your requests in this regard are not carried out when school accommodation is available, you should then be guided by the provisions of the Family Allowance Act.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of July 23rd in which you enclosed copy of a letter received from Jean Courtoisielle.\n\nIn previous years, one of the Fathers from the Mission St. Henri brought the children to school after rounding them up and submitted an account. I do not know of any time when the Mission was paid $300.00 for a trip one way. However, in 1950 we paid a bill amounting to $328.20 - our Voucher No. 8 of January 10th, 1950, to the Mission St. Henri. This included the cost of taking the children to their homes at the end of the school term in June, 1949, and of bringing them back to school in the fall of 1949. On this trip, Father Jean was accompanied by a Sister. The purpose of this was to explain to the children and parents the reason for the children to attend school in the hope that in future years less effort and cost would be expended in bringing the children to school. On this trip 38 children were brought in. There was a considerable amount of bad weather experienced on this trip, which delayed them. Also included in this amount of $328.20 was $40.00 for the transportation over the portage by Mr. R. A. Barrett. As the Indians own sufficient teams, they should be prepared to transport them over the portage free of charge.\n\nLast summer, Father Serrand - the Principal of the school - said that he was unwilling to take over this work. It was also felt that the Chiefs and Councillors of this Band should accept the responsibility of seeing that a sufficient number of children were sent to the Indian Residential School.\nThis was thoroughly discussed at a Council Meeting and the Chief deputized Councillor Jean Courtoisielle to see the children were brought in. I agreed with Jean Courtoisielle that he be given the sum of $80.00 to defray the cost of gas, etc., for taking the children and that he was to get the full support of the rest of the Band. Jean Courtoisielle finally brought in 32 children. He then pointed out to me that the $80.00 was not sufficient. Because of the effort he had made, I reviewed the situation and offered to pay his bills plus $25.00 for his labor. I refer you to our Voucher No. 438 of October 24, 1950, in the amount of $70.00 (made payable to the Hudson's Bay Company, Fort Vermilion), which involved the cost of gas, oil and food. I supplied him with sufficient gas to return to Little Red River. This is accounted for under our Voucher No. 67 - payable to Mrs. M. Batt, Fort Vermilion, Alta., under date of January 19th, 1951, in the amount of $10.80.\n\nWe also paid him an additional sum of $25.00 which is part of our Voucher No. 89, payable to the Hudson's Bay Company, under date of January 19th, 1951.\n\nA few more children were later brought in by Francis Meneen, another Indian, for the sum of $15.00. Mr. R. A. Barnett also was paid the sum of $8.00 for transporting these last children over the portage - our Voucher No. 130 of February 22, 1951. The amount of $15.00 paid to Francis Meneen is included in our Voucher No. 89 of January 19th, 1951, payable to the Hudson's Bay Company. This makes a total of $128.80 for bringing in less than 40 children.\n\nAn agreement was made with the Councillor, as he well knows, and we went further than this by giving him additional money for his efforts. I do not think we should have to pay a Councillor for work which is part of his duties and for which no other Councillor is paid. These people must be made to realize that the people of the Ambroise Tete Hoir Band at Childs Lake have to bring their children a distance of thirty miles to the school and never have received a nickel in payment. The people of the Tallcree Band live a distance of sixty-five miles from Fort Vermilion. They bring their children to school in the fall and take them home at the close of school in the spring and have never been paid anything for doing this.\n\nI think it is only reasonable and fair to expect that in future the people of the Cree Band at Fox Lake be held responsible for bringing their children to the end of the portage at their own expense and that we should assume the expense for\ntransporting them from the end of the portage to Fort Vermilion, which I believe can be done for less than $20.00.\n\nI cannot say where Jean Courtorielle got his information of the Mission being paid $300.00. In any case, it was understood that Jean Courtorielle would see that the children were brought to school as his duty as a Councillor and we did not make any arrangements to hire him individually for the sole purpose of bringing in the children.\n\nWith your permission I would like to take a stronger stand on this matter this year and notify the people that the children must be at the portage on a certain date and that they should undertake that part of the journey at their own cost. There are sufficient wagons, teams and boats amongst these Indians to enable them to bring all the children to the end of the portage without involving the Department in any expense. If we are getting such good co-operation from the other Bands in the Agency, it is only reasonable to expect the members of the Cree Band to do the same.\n\nI would therefore suggest that we inform the Chief's and Councillors that the pupils must be at the end of the portage on a certain date and that all those not there on that particular date will be considered as absentees, their Family Allowance stopped and action taken for absentee pupils.\n\nI am sending you two copies of this letter in case you wish to send one copy to Mr. Jean Courtorielle with your comments.\n\nS. C. Knapp,\nSuperintendent.\n\nSCK/pk\nIn duplicate.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of July 23rd in which you enclosed copy of a letter received from Jean Courtoiselle.\n\nIn previous years, one of the Fathers from the Mission St. Henri brought in the children to school after 'rounding them up' and submitted an account. I do not know of any time when the Mission was paid $300.00 for a trip one way. However, in 1950 we paid a bill amounting to $328.20 - our Voucher No. 8 of January 10th, 1950, to the Mission St. Henri. This included the cost of taking the children to their homes at the end of the school term in June, 1949, and of bringing them back to school in the fall of 1949. On this trip, Father Jean was accompanied by a Sister.

Mr Utz found full cooperation from Mr Knapp, according to Mr Hopper, School Inspector from the Province, was hundred percent in favor of the scheme, supplied him with admission papers and he told him what to do to get the grant.\n\nIt is true that Mr Knapp sent a letter to Father Vanderstein, saying that the Indian Department wouldn't have nothing to do with Mr Utz, but in the other hand, he said the contrary to Mr Utz himself. Then, Father Vanderstein seeing Mr Knapp saying something and doing just the contrary, came back to Fort Vermilion.\n\nSince that, some letters have been sent to Little Red River district to tell people to bring their children. Mr Knapp went down to Red River once, on some business but didn't bring one child back.\n\nRe: Day-School. The day-school business was started last year, by Mr Knapp, without having consulted me. Also, some people came to see me, last year, asking me what they would do with their children. I told them; bring your children to the convent, as usual. They answered me: \"Mr Knapp, told us: 'We couldn't do it.\" Also, this year, he advised some people, to send their children to the public school, where they will be better taught. Such is the man we have to deal with. I told Mr Waller: \"I lost confidence in Mr Knapp, and I wouldn't never trust him.\"\n\nI thought those informations could help you, to size up the situation and find out who is responsible for all the trouble we are having now.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nFather P.

Mr. Utz is regarded as the tutor for the two children of Mr. Judd, a half-breed, who lives at Little Red River. Backed by Mennonite funds he came to this solid Catholic district and caused a lot of trouble for the Indian Superintendent, Mr. Knapp. The white settlers do not want the school which Utz is attempting to set up. They have all sent their children to Fort Vermillion.\n\nAbove all, it should be understood that Utz is not a qualified teacher and has had no teaching experience. He intended to use the Correspondence School lessons.\n\nThe situation was explained by me to the Department of Education and in view of the disturbing factors, the Department decided not to authorize this school.\n\nL.

Knapp that everything is being done to bring Indian children from the Fox Lake Band, which is near Little Red River, to Fort Vermilion Residential School and that no children are being directed to the Little Red River school.

Further to the above and to previous reports as submitted in this regard, the writer advises that the plans as made for travel to Little Red River by motor transport had to be abandoned due to heavy snowfalls. However, on the 6-12-51 the writer was contacted by S.C. Knapp, Indian Supt., at this point and advised that an aircraft was being chartered for purpose of bringing in a slick Indian from Fifth Meridian and it would be possible for this member to accompany the patrol and take the action as required relative to this file.\n\n2. Leaving detachment at 10.45 a.m. via Associated Airways craft, the writer patrolled to Fifth Meridian and Little Red River areas at which time \"Notices to Parents\" under provisions of section 118 of Indian Act were served and the children of school age who were present at the Posts picked up. Remaining at Little Red River overnight due to adverse flying weather, patrol returned to Ft. Vermilion at 11.15 a.m. of 7-12-51.\n\n3. Altogether only six children were brought into school as result of this aforementioned patrol and these were flown from the Posts at Fifth Meridian and Little Red River together with the slick Indian on the one flight. A meeting was held at Little Red River on the evening of the 6.12.51, said meeting being called by J. Nanooch, Councillor at that point. Both the writer and Mr. Knapp attending. It was brought out at this meeting that some discrepancy had been made in regard to the children of Treaty Indian people as provided for in the Indian Act. They having understood at the time that Mr. Waller, Indian Dept., School Inspector was present at Little Red River last fall that they could send their children to any school that they desired. They were informed to the contrary and acquainted with the Sections of the Indian Act regarding school attendance of Treaty Indian children. At conclusion of the meeting the Indian parents present stated, that they all now understood their obligations and would spread the word to other Indian parents and all have their children into Little Red River by the 20-12-51 advising this office accordingly so that transportation could be arranged from that point to the Residential School at this point.\n\ncontinued\n4.

The R.C.M.P. went along on this plane to visit Fifth Meridian and Little Red River to deal with truancy. The weather closed in and we were forced to stay at Little Red River overnight.\n\nThe R.C.M.P. served truant notices for twenty-six children. Six children were brought back and admitted to school. Three of these children were attending Mr. Utz's school. Four other children have since been sent into residence, making a total of ten.\n\nThe truancy notices were made out to be effective on the twentieth December, owing to many of the men having to return to their trapping camps and bring their children back to Little Red River as the assembly point.\n\nThe cost of bringing in these children by caboose or bombadier was carefully worked out. The bombadier was found to be the cheaper of the two. The bombadier will therefore leave on the twentieth to bring the children to the Fort.\n\nThe R.C.M.P. will also go along on this trip in case the Moose Lake Indians have failed to carry out the orders on the truant notices. In which case the bombadier will proceed to Moose Lake to pick them up.\nInvestigations have been made into some of the homes of parents sending their children as day pupils. Where home conditions were found to be below requirements and destitution prevailed the children have been ordered into residence.\n\nWe will report further after the twentieth. It must be remembered that these children are scattered in six different camps and are difficult to reach.\n\nYou can rest assured that everything possible is being done to get these children into school and we hope to be able to say on our next report that this school is filled.\n\nS.C.

In October, 1951, she appeared clinically well and the pulmonary lesion appeared stable. She had no symptoms then of peritonitis.\n\nIn view of the crowded bed conditions Dr. Orford suggested she be discharged to the Residential School. I believe she is 5 years of age.

We are forwarding a number of these for you.\n\nWe are forwarding an extra copy of this letter for transmission to the Principal.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEncl: MFT/HM\nFort Vermilion, Alberta,\n7th, February, 1952.\n\nMr Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Quarterly Grant for Fort Vermilion I.R.S.\n\nThe Bursar, the Rev. Father Tessier, O.M.I. of the Fort Vermilion Residential School, has recently visited the office to discuss the cheque he received recently. This cheque represents payment of the Quarterly Grant for the quarter ending December 31st, 1951.\n\nHe seems to be confused as to how the figures on his cheque were determined. He further seemed inclined to think that perhaps it should have been more.\n\nAs this problem arises from time to time, it would be appreciated if you could let us know the figures used and the method in determining the amount payable to the Fort Vermilion School, as calculated from the December Quarterly Returns.\n\nIf two additional copies of this letter could be made, one for the Fort Vermilion School and one for the Hay Lake School, showing us an example to use for future returns, I am sure that this problem would not arise again.\n\nWe would deeply appreciate this information, not only for our own guidance but for the guidance of the Fathers concerned.\n\nS.C. Knapp\nSuperintendent.\n\nSCK.\n\nC.C. Mr G.H. Gooderham,\nRev. Father Tessier, O.M.I.\nApril 29, 1952.\n\nMr. S.C. Knapp,\nSupt.

Knapp,\nSupt. Indian Agency,\nFort Vermilion, Alta.,\n\nAttached I am returning the application for admission for Billy Grandjambe to the Fort Vermilion Indian Residential School for necessary signatures.\n\nWith reference to the December Quarterly Return for the Fort Vermilion Indian Residential School on which the following pupils names were entered for the first time and for whom application for admission to this school have not been received:\n\n312 John J. Antoine\n313 Louis Moberley\n314 Johnny Grandjambe\n315 Michel Naskiye\n316 Solomon Door\n317 Leo Makweyan\n318 Lhjod Antoine\n0331 Mary Jane Pitchemun\n0332 Hilda Auger\n0333 Mary Jane Nanotch\n0334 Elenore Naskiye\n0335 Esther Naskeye\n0337 Mary Jane Auger\n0338 Georgina Noskiye\n0339 Melanie Noskiye\n0340 Augustine Noskiye\n0341 Albina Metsikasus\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would forward the necessary applications to this office for consideration as soon as possible.\nWith reference to the March Quarterly Return, we wish to bring certain information to your attention:\n\nPupil # 0260 returned to residence on March 1st. The Principal claimed ninety-one days. This was reduced to thirty-one days.\n\nPupil # 0278 was absent in hospital from February 11 to March 19 consequently the school was allowed eighty-five days grant for her.\n\nPupil # 0282 has been in hospital since September 1951, consequently the school was not entitled to any grant and the Return has been amended.\n\nPupil # 0293 has been in hospital since February 5, 1951 and no grant was allowed for her.\n\nPupil # 0315 has been in hospital since November 15, 1951 and no grant has been allowed.\n\nPupil # 0330 has been previously listed as day pupil, consequently no grant was allowed for her.\n\nRegarding pupil # 0334 this pupil was taken to hospital on January 5, 1952. The Department allowed a hospital grant of thirty days making a total of thirty-five days which was allowed for this pupil.\n\nPupil # 03365 was admitted to the hospital on January 28, 1952. Thirty days hospital grant was added to this making a total of fifty-eight days allowed.\n\nPupil # 0337 was placed in hospital on January 19, 1952 consequently only forty-nine days was allowed.\n\nPupil # 283 was placed in hospital on September 25, 1951 and discharged on January 7 consequently the school was entitled to eighty-four days.\n\nAs pupil # 0294 has been in hospital since September, 1951 no grant has been allowed.\n\nPupil # 298 has been previously listed as a day pupil consequently no grant was allowed on this quarter.\n\nPupil # 319 returned from hospital March 3rd, twenty-eight days grant was allowed.\nIn all of the above-mentioned cases, the Principal has claimed ninety-one days grant. We have reduced the grant to the figures shown above with the result that the total enrolment totalled 7,974 or an average of 87.63.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would bring this matter to Father Serrand's attention advising him that he should claim grant for pupils who are in residence only. In cases where pupils are placed in hospital, the school is entitled to thirty days hospital grant following the date the pupil left for hospital. When discharged from the hospital and the pupil returns to the school grant may be claimed from the date the pupil actually entered the school only.\n\nPupils who are attending the Fort Vermilion school on day basis should be reported on Form PMR and should not be included on the Quarterly Return as no grant can be claimed for them.\n\nI am attaching a copy of this letter which you can forward to Father Serrand for his information and comments.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nEncls\n\nMFT/HM\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Fort Vermilion I.R.S.\nQuarterly Returns.\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 29th, file 766-10-E6, I wish to report that this matter has been discussed with the Rev. Father Serrand, O.M.I. with the following result.\n\nThe Application for Admission Forms requested are attached. Only pupils Nos. 0334 and 0335 have been signed by the parents. The remainder of the pupils were truants.\n\nThese pupils were ordered to report to Little Red River, where we picked them up and brought them into school. The Rev. Father Vanderstein was later given the forms to take to the parents. He has stated in a letter to me that many of the parents have refused to sign. I think a cooling off period should be allowed before we again approach the parents to sign these forms. Many of these Indians are primitive and cannot see the need of education. Perhaps when the children return and make a good report of how well they were cared for at school the situation will greatly change.\n\nUnder the circumstances it is recommended that the forms be accepted with my signature. Should this be unacceptable we will again take the matter up with the parents.\n\nRegarding pupils number 0330 and 298, the homes of these children were visited and found to be sub-standard. The father had earned less than $35.00 per month for the past three months. Both the R.C.P.P and myself considered them welfare cases and therefore directed them...\ninto residence where they would be fed and clothed properly. Family Allowance was suspended. Under these circumstances it is recommended that the school receive the \"arch quarterly grant for these two pupils.\n\nRegarding the first paragraph of page three the quarterly forms have been amended to conform with the changes as listed.\n\nThe Crees are scattered during the winter months in many small camps, which are difficult to reach, even for the resident missionary and the problem of getting signatures on the Application for Admission Forms is very difficult.\n\nS.C. Knapp\nSuperintendent.\nIndian Residential School,\nFort Vermilion, Alberta,\nMay 10, 1952\n\nMr. S. Knapp, Superintendent,\nFort Vermilion, Alberta\n\nDear Mr. Knapp:\n\nIn reference to letter dated April 29, 1952 File 766-10 (E)\n\nI am sorry that I can do nothing about it as I had nothing to do with the picking up of the children at this time. You will recall that the matter of Truancy was dealt with by the Indian Dept. during the month of December 1951. Further to this the R.C.I.R. took action on behalf of the Indian Dept. Regarding the matter of truancy, I do not feel that I am in any position to complete the signatures of these application forms. May I suggest that during Treaty time these forms be completed by your department.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Knapp,\nAupt. Indian Agency,\nFort Vermilion, Alta.,\n\nWith reference to the June Quarterly Return for the Fort Vermilion Indian Residential School, it is noted that pupils 0262, 241, 243, 246, 281, 285 and 307 were in hospital for a short period of time during the quarter. As all of these children except pupil # 281 were in hospital for less than thirty days full grant of 31 days was allowed for each of them.\n\nAs pupil # 281 was admitted to hospital on May 14th the Principal should have claimed 74 days which was allowed as this pupil was in residence for 44 days plus 30 days hospital grant which is allowed. It is noted that pupil # 0142 was admitted to residence after discharge from hospital on May 13, consequently the school is entitled to 48 days grant rather than 44 as indicated by the Principal.\n\nFor pupil # 313 the Principal has shown in the Remarks Column that this pupil was admitted to hospital on May 8 and discharged on May 29 while he has only claimed 37 days grant for this pupil. It is evident that this child was also in the Charles Cassell Hospital but the Principal has neglected to indicate the dates in this regard. We are consequently disallowing any grant for this pupil as the data available is not sufficient to pay the Per Capita Allowance for this pupil on the June Return. Please advise the Principal that it will be in order for him to claim 37 days grant on the September Return together with the\ngrant for which the school is entitled for this pupil for the September Quarter, but the Principal will have to explain in the Remarks Column the circumstances for claiming the 37 days.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Fort Vermilion Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: [Name]\nEnglish name: [Name]\nAge: [Age]\nName of Band: [Band]\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: [Ticket No.]\nFather's full name and No.: [Name]\nMother's full name and No.: [Name]\nParents living or dead: [Living/Dead]\nState of child's health: [Health]\nReligion: [Religion]\nDoes applicant speak English?: [Yes/No]\nPreviously attended school for years: [Years]\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\n*Signature of Missionary or other Witness*\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.*\n\nNOTE\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

Indian Agency,\nFort Vermilion, Alta.,\n\nWith reference to the September Quarterly Return for the Fort Vermilion Indian Residential School, we do not appear to have the necessary application for admission for pupil 331 Leo Courtereille; consequently we are disallowing any grant for him on the September Return. It would be appreciated if you would arrange to have this application forwarded to this office for approval and when it is approved ask the Principal to include this boy's name on the December Quarterly Return claiming grant for him for the month of September and for the number of days the school is entitled to for the December Quarter.\n\nPupil # 0334 was not in residence during the month of June as she was in the Charles Camsell Hospital consequently the school is not entitled to per capita grant for the months of July and August. We are, therefore, allowing thirty days grant for this pupil.\n\nThe Principal has neglected to indicate the dates the pupils were absent from residence. If you will bring the Principal's attention to our circular he will note that in all instances where pupils are in residence for less than the prescribed number of days for the quarter, an explanation must be given and the dates when the pupil left the residence and when he returned to residence. In the case of the September Return the Principal neglected to indicate the dates for pupils 243 and 294.\nPlease refer to our letter of July 30, third paragraph regarding pupil # 313 for whom the Principal claimed thirty-seven days grant on the June Return on which the Department disallowed as there was insufficient information to indicate the circumstances why the Principal claimed thirty-seven days grant for him. The Principal has again claimed thirty-seven days grant but failed to show the dates that the pupil left the residence and later returned to residence and the reason for the absences, consequently we are disallowing the thirty-seven days requested.\n\nPlease instruct the Principal that he may claim this grant on the December Return but a definite explanation must be provided before the Department will allow the grant.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Fort Vermilion Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child: Nancy Mobily\nEnglish name:\nAge: 13\nName of Band: Fall Creek\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid: 84\nFather's full name and No.: Narcisse Mobily\nMother's full name and No.: Maude Mitchell\nParents living or dead: Living\nState of child's health: Good\nReligion: Catholic\nDoes applicant speak English?: Yes\nPreviously attended: Fort Vermilion Residential School for 3 years\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNote\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI recommend the admission of the above child, who is of good moral character and is eligible to be admitted as a grant-earning pupil.\n\nAgent\n\nNote\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

The family\nthis fall was living in a tent and could not find housing\naccommodation for the winter. They therefore moved back\nto Tailcree Reserve some sixty five miles away, where there\nis no school. The children were therefore placed in\nresidence so that they could attend school. In any event\nthe home was definitely sub-Standard and if there had not\nbeen a definite improvement in the conditions of the home\nwe would have been compelled to send the children into\nresidence to ensure that they were adequately clothed and\nfed.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your\nletter, this information is being passed onto the Rev.\nFather Serrand, O.M.I., the Principal.\n\nS.C.

Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, requesting the Department to allow an increase in the pupilage at the Wabasca C. E. Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, owing to present regulations, the Department is unable to increase the pupilage of this school at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.O.,\n39-49, The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a letter dated July 26th, the Principal of our Wabasca School states that during the visit of the Treaty party to that School on July 23rd-25th, he directed the attention of the Indian Agent to the additional space which was being provided for pupils through the erection of a new class-room, and further states that the Indian Agent promised to recommend to your Department an increase in the pupilage. At the present time the official capacity as sanctioned by your Department is 30, and as the Principal points out that there are more than 12 pupils ready to come in, and that there is accommodation for at least 15, our Commission recommends that the official capacity be increased to 45 from the 1st of September next. As he reports that the Indian councillors at a meeting, urged that the increase be granted, our Commission sincerely hope that their recommendation may be accepted, and the increase authorized from the date mentioned.\n\nIn my letter of January 18th last, I endeavoured to place before your Department, not only the urgent need of an increased pupilage at this school, but the need of a new building to replace the one which was built by our Church many years ago. I also furnished an estimate of the cost of building and equipping a new log building, fixing the total cost at approximately $7,000. In your reply on January 25th, 131-8-1, you referred to the possibility of consideration being given to this matter when the supplementary estimates were being prepared.\n\nAs I have not heard anything further from you in this connection, I can only conclude that no provision was made in the supplementary estimates for this urgently needed improvement.\n\nUntil a new and larger school can be provided, our Commission feel strongly that they are justified in asking for the\nincreased pupilage, seeing that they have provided the increased accommodation, and it is very earnestly hoped that the increase requested may be sanctioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\n\nIndian Affairs.

St Bruno, Jossard, Alta.\n\nThe above is a partial list of residential schools in connection with which the Department pays a per capita grant. In these cases the Department did not build the schools and does not exercise the rights of ownership. It is noted that the last seven in the above list are in one agency i.e. the Grouard Agency.\n\nIn a number of these cases the Department is being asked to assume financial responsibility and to pay grants towards the capital costs of the buildings, besides making additional grants for additions, repairs and maintenance. In at least some instances there are undertakings on the part of the Department to furnish certain social assistance. Many of the engagements made in the past in this connection have been verbal in nature and the terms are not of definite record. It would seem clear, however, that in some, if not all cases the Department is obligated to some degree at least, but the lack of written records and agreements makes it very difficult to determine the nature and extent of this responsibility.\n\nThe fact that the Department has undertaken the payment of per capita grants implies a certain responsibility for the up-keep of the buildings, if not for the capital costs.\n\nIn my opinion it is necessary that the Department adopt a general policy for the purpose of dealing with these difficulties and I would respectfully offer the following suggestions for your consideration:\n1. That the Department of Indian Affairs undertake the payment of per capital grants and any financial aid towards the cost of building only when the prior authority of the Department has been granted. This authority should cover such matters as site, size and nature of school buildings.\n\n2. That such authority in all cases be set out in a formal and definitely worded agreement for the guidance of Departmental officials, as a matter of record and for the purpose of avoiding future misunderstandings.\n\n3. That the schools now operating by authority of the Department as recognized by the payment of per capita grants be assisted from time to time as circumstances warrant and financial conditions permit.\n\n4. That the various missionary societies be notified of the above rulings.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nHarold W. McGill.\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE.\nCALGARY, ALTA. August 2nd, 1933.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report on an inspection of the Church of England School situated on Wabasca Lake up near what they call the \"Narrows,\" about five miles from the Roman Catholic School.\n\nOn my arrival there I found there was no Principal in charge and the work was being carried on by the Matron. This is a very old building, having been built out of logs a great many years ago, and it is in a very poor state of repair. The floors are worn and as a whole the building is very dilapidated.\n\nThere are 32 children in residence. In the classroom there are only 19 seats; the rest are benches. The classroom is heated by two stoves, and they have only a small blackboard. The teacher in charge of the classroom was Miss A. C. Bloomer, who holds a second class certificate. She is a very capable teacher and I feel that good work is being performed. There are 22 pupils in Grade I, 4 in Grade II and 4 in Grade III.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6377, file 767-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nAs I have said before the building is all in a very poor state of repair: It is all heated by stoves, and there are no modern conveniences whatever. The staff, however, are handling the situation as well as possible, and I was pleased to note that they were all quite efficient.\n\nThe Matron, Miss Edith Goddard, is a Graduate Nurse. The Cook and general helper is Miss Kathleen MacDonald, Farming Instructor, W. Reynolds.\n\nAn exceptionally fine garden is raised by the school. With this report I am enclosing a snap-shot of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nOttawa, August 11, 1933.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, requesting a certificate covering your services at the St. John's Anglican Indian Residential School, Wabasca, Alta.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the staff at Indian residential schools are appointed and paid by the church authorities under whose auspices the school is conducted. Our records do not state definitely the period of your service at this school. The first quarterly return which was received signed by you as acting principal was for the quarter ending March 31, 1916; and the last, for the quarter ended March 31, 1920. No doubt, you were employed at this school between those dates. I would suggest that you apply to Rev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D., Field Secretary, M.S.C.C., 39-43 The Bible House, Alexander Avenue, Winnipeg, Man., who, no doubt, will be able to furnish you with the exact information you require as to your period of service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Ida E. Collins,\n163 Walker Road,\nWalkerville,\nOnt.\nTo the Head of the Indian Department of Government Affairs,\n\nI have been requested to get an acknowledgment of my residence in Wabasea, Alberta in the years I was a worker in the St. John's Indian Residential School there. Being teacher, each Monthly Return Report I filled, I sent to the Ottawa Government of Indian Affairs.\n\nI think the dates would be 1918, 1919, 1920 & a part of 1921. I really do not know for sure, but if you have any record of the teachers in that school, please give me at your earliest convenience an acknowledgment of the same.

K. L. Sandercock, L.Th., as Acting Principal of their St. John's Indian Residential School at Wawasee, Alberta, and arrangements are now being made for him to enter on his duties early in September next.\n\nIn the opinion of our Commission, Mr. Sandercock is very well qualified to fill this important position, as he has, in addition to other requirements, the advantage of considerable experience in this work which he received while filling a staff position for some years at the Mackay School. His wife has also had the benefit of a like experience which she received while filling a staff position at our Elkhorn School.\n\nMr. Sandercock is a graduate in Theology of Emmanuel College in Saskatoon, Sask., and is at present filling the position of Incumbent of the Church of England parish of Lucky Lake, in the Diocese of Qu'Appelle in the central part of the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nOur Commission commend his appointment to the favourable consideration and approval of your Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Indian Residential School, regarding his visit to the Long Lake district and stating the number of children of school age who could be recruited to the school.\n\nRegarding your request that the Department provide a per capita grant for 10 extra pupils, in order that the school can recruit this number from the Long Lake district, I regret that, as our appropriation for the current fiscal year has been so greatly reduced, we will be unable to provide funds for the purpose. The grant allowed for the Wabasca C. E. School for the current fiscal year is for 30 pupils, and no grant can be provided for an increase in this number.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.,\n39-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOur Commission have received from the Rev. J. M. Roe, B.A., Acting-Principal of our Wabasca School, a report on his visit during the month of February, to the Long Lake district, which is approximately 87 miles from Wabasca. On this visit he was accompanied by the Manager of the local Hudson's Bay Company's Post, and also by Nurse Bawden, who was able to administer treatment to some sixty Indians requiring medical attention.\n\nIn addition to visiting Indian families on the way to and from Long Lake, Mr. Roe was enabled while at Long Lake to visit the Indian settlements at Good Fish Lake, Goose Grass Lake, and Round Lake, and to secure much valuable information about the Indians, both Treaty and Non-Treaty, in Treaty District No. 8.\n\nWith regard to the number of people in Treaty District No. 8, Mr. Roe writes as follows:\n\n\"In this Treaty district (No. 8) there are supposed to be 650 souls receiving Treaty. There are quite 100 souls not receiving Treaty, but who are entitled to it. There are perhaps 50 souls in Indian families, who took out scrip. The non-treaty people in the same area would probably number 400 souls. (Wabasca voters list gives 100 names; and the Desmarais list about 100 names). The total population of the area would therefore be approximately 1200 souls.\"\n\nAs his report deals chiefly with the Indians in the Long Lake and adjacent settlements, I beg to inform you that he states there are some 25 Treaty children of school age in that\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6377, file 767-1, part 1)\narea, and that none of these have ever \"been entered in either of the schools, E.C. or R.C.\" In the family of an Indian named \"Thunder Spirit\", for instance, he states there are 7 children, all of whom, except the two youngest, have been baptized by our missionaries, and as the family \"are always in a state of semi-starvation\" the father and mother allowed him to take two of the children back to our Wabasca School with him.\n\nMr. Roe's report enumerates other families as well having children of school age, but he makes special reference to the following eight children which have \"a special claim for our consideration\", and which should be admitted to our school this Fall:\n\n\"Caroline Auger, age 7, daughter of Alexis and Agnes. Both parents were pupils in our School. Alexis \"went over\" to the R.C. Mission after leaving School. They were married by the R.C. priest. But the old association and allegiance returned, and their boy, Alphonse, now aged 9 was put into our School. They were \"promised\" that Caroline should come in this Fall.\n\nLilian Orr, age 7, daughter of George Orr. His boy, Bobby, age 12 is in School, and there are two children younger than Lilian.\n\nJoseph Auger, age 7, son of Usta Grasshead and Gertie (Aloek). Gertie was at this School, Usta was at the R.C. School. They wish their boy to be brought up here.\n\nJohn Nanimehoo, son of (age 7) Maxley, an Old Boy of this School. Maxley is generally in need of help; he has five children. This boy should come in to School in the Fall.\n\nBasil Nanimehoo, age 7, son of Pierre. One of a large family, (we have Katherine, Michael, Harvey and Mary Ann all of this family, in the School now) and the parents are generally in need of help.\n\nElizabeth Beaver, age 9, daughter of Councillor Martin Beaver, (we have Daniel and Florence in school now) and the Agent gave injunction to Martin that the child must come to School this year.\n\nViolet Cat, age 7, daughter of Johnny Cat, of the Reserve here. (we had Benwa, age 16, and Caroline, 19, in the School a few years ago). There are two or three younger children.\n\nMary Lenore Oar, age 7, daughter of Max Oar, on the Reserve here. There are two younger children, and Max cannot keep his family in necessities.\"\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6377, file 767-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nAs the school has a sanctioned capacity of 30 pupils only, and has a capacity enrolment at present, our Commission strongly recommend that the official capacity be increased to 40. With regard to the accommodation Mr. Roe writes, in part, as follows:\n\n\"But I am confident that we can provide accommodation here, with adjustments of space, etc., for 40 children, and so admit the 9 children I have listed, (in the Fall) plus the \"Beaver\" child whose mother at God's Lake is begging for her to be brought here. It only requires that I should have your sanction to make plans and get the adjustments of space made in time for the Fall School, and to be able to present my plans to the Indian Department's Inspector and the Indian Agent, when they come on Treaty and Inspection in June. For the sum of $100 we can make all the necessary alterations, etc., and by vigorous work through the Spring and Summer, we can be ready in the Fall.\"\n\nIn view of the urgency of the situation, and the limited appropriation which your Department has been given for this fiscal year, our Commission will provide the sum of $100, which it is estimated will be required to provide the necessary accommodation, and they sincerely trust that the increased capacity requested may be granted.\n\nYour favourable consideration of this urgent and important matter, affecting as it does the life-long welfare of a number of your Department's wards, will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nTBRW/JF\n\nIndian Affairs.

Arrangements were made by our Commission with the Canadian Airways Limited to take Mr. Roe from Edmonton to Wabasso by aeroplane in the early days of the current month of October, and although information of his arrival at Wabasso has not yet come to hand, this information is expected in the near future.\n\nFor your further information I may state that Mr. Roe is one of the most promising of the younger clergy in the Church of England. For some time he was on the staff of St. John's Cathedral in Winnipeg, and afterwards held a similar appointment on the staff of the pro-cathedral in Calgary. Our Commission are pleased to have the benefit of Mr. Roe's services in the important and responsible task assigned to them, and they trust that his appointment may be approved by your Department.

Indian Residential School, I have to inform you that the local Indian Agent forwarded a requisition stating in detail the lumber, etc., required, and he has been authorized to arrange for the purchase and forwarding of same to the school, to an amount not exceeding $250, which is also to include the freighting.\n\nIt is noted that the bedding, dishes and other equipment now at the Lesser Slave Lake School will be distributed between the Whitefish Lake and Wabasca Schools for the use of the additional pupilage. This Department would say the cost of the transportation charges involved in moving this equipment should be recorded of accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, with receipt attached for any transportation costs paid by your Society. If you prefer that the cost of transportation be paid direct to the parties who do the work, you should forward certified accounts in their favour, in triplicate, when a cheque would be sent direct.\n\nThe pupils now at the Lesser Slave Lake School can be distributed as considered advisable between the Wabasca and Whitefish Lake C. of E.

Marshall as Acting Principal of the Wabasca (St. John's) C. of E. Indian Residential School, to succeed Rev. S. Richardson, who is retiring. Mr. Marshall will likely take up duties about the middle of April, next. The Department is approving of Mr. George Arnold, who has been on the staff for some years, carrying out the duties between the departure of Rev. Mr. Richardson and the arrival of Rev. Mr. Marshall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nN. P. L'Heureux, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\nOttawa, January 29, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, advising the Department of the retirement of Rev. S. Richardson as Principal of the Wabasca (St. John's) C. of E. Indian Residential School, and requesting the appointment of Rev. A. R. Marshall as Acting Principal, to take up duties about the middle of April, next.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the qualifications which the Rev. Mr. Marshall possesses have been noted, and the Department will approve of his appointment as Acting Principal. Until such time as he takes up duties, it will be satisfactory to place the administration of the school in the hands of Mr. George Arnold, who has been on the staff for sometime and is familiar with the duties. The Acting Indian Agent, Mr. N. P. L'Heureux, Driftpile, Alta., will be informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R.

S. Richardson as Principal of St. John's Indian Residential School at Jubasco, Alta.\n\nThe Commission have appointed the Rev. A. R. Marshall, presently of Birch Hills, Saskatchewan, to succeed Mr. Richardson as Principal. Mr. Marshall comes highly recommended by the Lord Bishop of Saskatchewan and also by the Rev. J. W. House, Principal of the Blackfoot Indian Residential School. He is a married man of 32 years of age with a young family and during the period 1916 to 1919 served with the British Navy, retiring with the rank of Lieutenant R.N.V.R.\n\nAs Mr. Marshall is expecting an addition to his family sometime in March, it has been arranged that he shall spend some time at the Blackfoot School with a view to becoming familiar with the work and will probably not take up his post until about the middle of April. Pending his arrival the administration of the School is in the hands of Mr. George Arnold, who has been there for many years and successfully carried out the duties for some months between the departure of Mr. Longmore and the arrival of Mr. Richardson.\n\nThe appointment of Mr. Marshall, is, of course, that of Acting Principal at present and the Commission will be glad to receive the approval of your Department to the\naction that has been taken.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

F. Longmore retired from the Acting Principalship of the Nipissing School at the beginning of September when his contract with our Society expired, and that Mr. George Arnold who has filled the position of Farm Instructor at this School for some years past, was asked by our Commission to discharge the duties of Acting Principal until a permanent appointment could be made. I regret that chiefly on account of my absence from Winnipeg, you were not officially notified of this action at an earlier date, and trust that the temporary appointment of Mr. Arnold may meet with your approval. Every effort will, of course, be made by our Society to secure an Ordained man for the Principalship of this School at the earliest date possible, but, in the meantime, I feel that I can assure you the supervision of the work there will be carefully conducted by the present staff.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Longmore as teacher in an Indian day school. It is also noted that the September quarter return of the Wabasca C.E. Residential School is signed by George Arnold, acting principal. It appears from the above that a change has been made in the principalship of the Wabasca School but, as yet, no official intimation has been received from your office and the Department would appreciate hearing from you in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Indian Residential School, and we have been informed that this boy requires medical treatment which can only be received at Edmonton.\n\nThe return shows that this boy is apparently about eight years of age and that he entered the Wabasca School in September, 1925. Please advise me, as soon as possible, if he is an Indian and, if so, state the band to which he belongs. You should also advise if you consider that he requires medical attention and state, if possible, the approximate expenditure that would be incurred by sending him to Edmonton.

I am informed that there may be some doubt as to this girl's status as an Indian, and before incurring expense on her behalf, it will be necessary to know something concerning her antecedents and history.

Farier, Esq., M.A.,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Farier:\n\nDuring my recent visit to Ottawa I regret that I omitted to consult you with regard to a minor operation on one of the pupil's, recommended by the Medical Officer, Dr. Jenkins of Edmonton, when he visited the School at Wabasca. The name of the pupil is Veronique Bellam, one of the smaller girl's in the Institution. It would appear from letters received from the Acting Principal, Rev. F. Longmore, and the Teacher, Miss Muriel Dawe, that this pupil requires special treatment for her eyes, in addition to an operation on her throat.\n\nThere appears to have been some question in the past about the pupil's eligibility as a grant earning pupil. But Mr. Longmore states in his letter that he understands Archdeacon White took her case up with your Department, and that you agreed to pay the grant as her Mother was living with a treaty Indian, her father being dead. I am unable to verify this information, but if you find it correct I shall be glad if you will let me know if this pupil may proceed to Edmonton at the beginning of July next under the escort of Miss Muriel Dawe, the Teacher, who is coming out at that time to consult an oculist. If you will authorize this, the authorization to carry with it, the travelling expenses of the pupil and her escort, as well as the expenses for the operation on the pupil, I shall be very grateful indeed.\n\nIndian Affairs.

While appreciating the fact that there has been a decided increase in the cost of the maintenance of these institutions, I regret that I am unable at the present time to make any definite promise that there will be an increase in the per capita grant allowed by the Department, as no additional funds have been placed at our disposal to meet such increase.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev.

Before they were established whitefish could be procured in abundance and at small cost. It formed the staple article of diet with variation of Moose meat, bacon or beef.\n\nAll meat is now excessively high in cost and fish not less so.\n\nAbnormal prices prevail for flour and other necessary commodities without which the children cannot be maintained in health.\n\nThe cost of provisions in each Mission has risen proportionately. Salaries have been increased in some cases.\n\nThe payment of all labour connected with the missions has extended.\n\nA grant for each child of twice the amount made in 1910, ($125 per annum) would not much more than equalize the conditions prevailing then and now.\n\nA generous increase is absolutely needed.\n\nE.A.

We have in the meantime to meet the costs for provision etc., from Diocesan funds. Have any of the free grants been paid to the Missionaries in charge?

At least $1000 is required for this purpose. Two-thirds of the unit earned by the free capital grant in both schools, learning only one third to support forty scholars. I see no possibility of our keeping open these two schools under present circumstances\u2014or how we are to meet the liabilities for the present school year.\n\nIf the Dept. could see their way to build\u2014\n\nIndian Affairs.

What would be agreeable to us? Most satisfactory to the Deptt. would be for some competent & well qualified representative to visit, investigate, as well as examine the schools. If this were done by any fair minded person we should not fear this result. In the meantime a grant of $300 towards teaching salaries for each of the above schools would enable us to hold on some time, especially if the per capita grants extended to 25 for Wapostow and 20 for White Fish Lake.\n\nI trust you will kindly give this request your generous consideration.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nGeorge Athabasca\nOttawa, February 17th, 1910.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nReferring to that portion of Your Lordship's letter of the 26th ultimo in which you ask for increased pupilage at Wabiskaw Lake and Whitefish Lake (C.E.) Boarding schools, and also for a grant to the Peace River school, I beg to say that the question of increasing the pupilage at the two first mentioned schools will receive consideration when the supplementary estimates for the next fiscal year are being dealt with.\n\nIn reference to the grant to the school at Peace River the Department desires to know whether this is the school which is known as the Christ Church Mission School, Upper Peace River. In 1904-05 the Department provided a grant of $300.00 for the Christ Church Mission School, but no returns were received from December, 1907, till December, 1909. The return for the December quarter of last year came to hand a few days ago and a cheque for $75.00 was sent to you.\n\nBe good enough to advise the Department by return mail whether the Christ Church Mission School is the one referred to in Your Lordship's letter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRight Rev. Geo. Holmes, D.D.,\nBishop of Athabasca,\nAthabasca Landing,\nvia Edmonton, Alta.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6377, file 767-1, part 1)\nOttawa, February 15th, 1910.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nBishop Holmes, of Athabasca, has renewed the request for an increased grant to the Church of England Boarding Schools at Wabiskaw Lake and Whitefish Lake, Treaty 8, and for a day school grant at Peace River.\n\nWe have lately made them a day school grant at Lesser Slave Lake and in 1904-05 a grant of $300.00 for the Peace River school was voted. No returns were received from December, 1907, till December, 1909. The latter was received a few days ago and payment has been made.\n\nWhile I would not recommend making an exception in favour of these two boarding schools in the matter of per capita grant I am of opinion that the question of an increase in the pupilage is worthy of consideration.\n\nThe returns from the Wabiakaw school show that in the June quarter, last, there were enrolled 37 pupils and in the December quarter 19. His Lordship claims that this reduction was made because they could not afford to keep any in excess of the number for which the Department will pay the grant; not because of any lack of pupils. There has also been a reduction in the number maintained at Whitefish Lake.\n\nThere are several arguments that might be advanced in favour of an increased pupilage at these points.\n\nIn the first place the same staff is required to conduct a school for 15, the number now allowed, as for 25, pupils, the number asked for.\n\nThe\nThe cost of supplies in these outlying posts is very high, caused principally by the excessive freight rates.\n\nDay schools are and for sometime will be impracticable in this district, as the Indians will depend upon the hunt for their living for years yet.\n\nThey have accommodation for the increased number asked for.\n\nThe earnings of 15 pupils are evidently not sufficient to finance a school. The Bishop states that last year he expended $4000.00, collected by him in England, in paying deficits that had accrued. The deficit at Wabiskaw for the year ended June 30th, last, was said to be $1000.00. I may here add that the Roman Catholic school at Wabiskaw Lake receives a grant for 25 pupils.\n\nMr. Inspector Conroy has reported very favourably on the work being done by these two schools and I would recommend that provision be made in the supplementary estimates for a grant of $73.00 to 10 additional pupils each at Wabiskaw and Whitefish Lake.\nDear SIR,\n\nWhile at Wapuskow I carefully went into the financial condition of the Indian Boarding Schools and with the exercise of the strictest economy I find that it will be absolutely impossible to continue under present circumstances. As I have before represented the same staff of workers is required for fifteen scholars as would serve for twenty five, and the cost of upkeep and equipment almost the same we have reduced the number of scholars from thirty four to 25 and still the grant of $72.00 for fifteen will not cover more than half of the expenditure, this also applies to White Fish Lake.\n\nWe are obliged to refuse the Children of Scrip Indians when they are beginning to learn the mistake they have made and want what it means to be a white man. The workers are anxious to know what is to be the future of the school before June next, as they must look out for new situations if the school is to be closed.\n\nI once again plead with the Department to make us a grant for $25 in each of the three schools viz-Wapuskown, and White Lake & make a lump sum grant\nfor Peace River School, where there are six treaty children in residence, as you have so kindly done for Lesser Slave Lake, thus we would be able to continue the work instead of having to close the schools.\n\nWithin the last year, I have paid over $4000 of school arrears out of funds, I collected in England for the purpose, these funds are now exhausted so it would be no longer possible.\n\nI have estimated that each pupil cost $100 for support, where is possible to have Day schools, I should close all the Boarding Schools at once but as the Agents are aware, a day school would not reach 1-10 of the children.\n\nTrusting that the Department will once more favourably consider the urgent appeal.\n\n(signed) Geo. Athabasca\nAthabasca Landing,\nAthabasca Alta., Sept. 22, 1906.\n\nHon. Sir,\n\nThe Bishop of Athabasca desires respectfully to lay before you the position of affairs in the Indian Schools.\n\nHe assumed office in the Diocese last April, and has since personally visited, and on the spot gone most carefully into the conduct and upkeep of the following schools:\n\nre Wapuskow School\n\n35 scholars were supported, educated and clothed in this school during the year ending June 30th, last.\n\nThe staff maintained was sufficient for this number.\n\nHe found a sum of $1000.00 deficit on the working expenses of the school for the year ending June 30th, last. This is accounted for mainly by the fact that the per capita grant was for 15 children only.\n\nThis manifestly is inadequate, and he begs the Department to increase the grant to the number of 25.\n\nWith such a grant he conceives the possibility of maintaining the school in a state of efficiency.\n\nI am, Honorable Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgd Rev.

If a pupil leaves the school, his number is not to be given to any other pupil, but each child is to be given a number of his own by which he is always known. I should be glad if you would advise the Principal accordingly and ask him to see that all the columns of the quarterly returns are filled up and the totals entered at the foot of the page.\n\nIt is also observed that six of the pupils on the September quarter return are under the age limit of seven years and are therefore only entitled to half the grant.\n\nI should be glad if Your Lordship would be good enough to acknowledge the receipt of this letter.\n\nI have the honor to\n\nRt.Rev.R.Young,D.D.,\nBishop of Athabasca\nAthabasca Landing\nvia Edmonton,N.W.T.\n\nYour Lordship's most obedient servant\n\nSecretary\nOTTAWA, 23rd October, 1901.\n\nRev.

Human has made application, on behalf of the Bishop of Athabasca, for a grant for a boarding school under the auspices of the Church of England at Waskow. The number of pupils on the return is 15 and Mr. Human would like to have a grant this year if it can be given. I do not know whether any funds are available for this year and I think it is too early yet to know whether we will have sufficient money to consider this application, and consequently it would be undesirable to undertake to make any grants for the present fiscal year.\n\nI may say that Mr. Conroy, who has been in charge of the payment of Treaty in this district, recommends that this school be given the same grant as is made to other schools in a similar position. He considers the average attendance at 15 is placing it too high but he\nsays he can tell definitely next winter when he visits the district. I do not, however, think it would be advisable to offer Mr. Burman a grant on a less number of pupils than 15, at $72.00 per capita, if we are going to give a grant at all, as in any case the Department will only pay for the pupils in actual attendance during the year.\n\nDeputy Minister.\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 16th October, 1901.\n\nIn reference to the Deputy Minister's memorandum of the 15th inst., I would recommend that the Mission School at Wahiscow be given the usual grant accorded to other schools in a similar position.\n\nThe average attendance appears to me to be too high, but I could tell definitely how many Indian children there are attending school when I have made my winter visit there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI think that Mr. Conroy might express an opinion with regard to this application for a grant to the Wasiskow School. I do not know whether this is the school that Mr. Conroy has already reported on or not, but if it is I understand that we have already asked the Indian Commissioner for his opinion, and I would like to know for sure.\n\nM.A. Conroy\nDeputy Supt.

The Bishop has before set the facts of the case and the great need of the school before you but for some reason the grant applied for was not allowed.\n\nMay I say you kindly to reconsider this matter which is one of extreme importance to us. The enclosed memorandum from the Bishop dated May 13th last will give you a short history of the school and its strength at that date. The school returns sent herewith for the ending Dec 31st will show what was being done. We feel that under the circumstances we are quite justified making a grant on the usual conditions. If you could in your next estimate provide for say fifteen (15) pupils, or better still if you could give an emergency grant before next fiscal year, you will place us under obligations.\n\nSincerely yours,\nW.E.

With all our efforts we are thirteen hundred dollars $1300 overdue.\n\nI may say, as witness of the Department's consideration, that we were encouraged to proceed in this work by the following letter from the Department:\n\nOttawa 7th May 1896. My Lord, In reply to your lordship's letter of the 17th inst. I beg to say that the Department will do what it can to assist you in your school work at Wapuskau, but present there are no funds available for the purpose. An item, will however, be inserted in the Supplementary Estimates for next year.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This seems the more desirable in prospect of the Government's treaty arrangement with the Indians of the North for next year.

And after reading the Bible from during last winter had from Canon Spencer letter, I thought 16 Oct. 24 under instruction it best to write myself and he has no allowance paid you, & kindly inquire any kind for them but about the school at Wahnapitae supports them out by his brow before the appropriation salary and any gifts that were made may be sent to him by I should have written friends.

McNEILL\nActing Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6377, file 767-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nHerewith is a letter from the Bishop of the Diocese regarding an application for assistance to a school conducted by a missionary of the Church of England at Napaskiak or Nabeska, between the Athabasca and Peace Rivers.\n\nThe Department knows very little about this school, as it does not receive returns from it. From letters on file from the Bishop and the missionary in charge it appears that the school has been conducted for two years, that there is an attendance of about fifteen children, that there is no other school within a radius of a hundred miles, and that the only contribution that the Government has made to it was a supply of seed for a vegetable garden.\n\nOn the 25th May 1896 the Bishop was informed that, provision would be made in the supplementary estimates for 1897-98 for this school; but this was not done. I do not know why.\n\nH.C. Ross\nTo the Deputy Superintendent\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Hayter Reed,\n\nReferring to your letter No. 138788 of May 25, 1896. In reliance on the Department's promise in said letter, we have spared no expense to make our Indian School at Wapuskans effective. The teacher is Mr. A. J. Bruce, a former student of St. John's Coll. School Winnipeg. The Head, C. Weaver who is the Principal has spared no pains in making the children (all Indians) comfortable. The healthy well fed appearance of the children on each of my visits is evidence of the care & kindness shown them. After my visit there on January 5th February of 1897 I wrote the Department at Ottawa March 10 stating the condition of the School, building & attendance.\n\nIn reply to this I only received a letter No. 138788 of April 15, 1897 which barely acknowledges my letter of March 10 again referring to this matter.\n\nIn a correspondence I have had with Mr. A. Houghton, Indian Commissioner, he promised to send forms of returns in his\nletter No. 141. These have not been received. I have now therefore to enclose Returns for the Wapuskau School as made out by the Teacher.

What was more to the point, I had an attentive audience of men and women to whom I set forth the way of salvation through Christ Jesus. One old Indian woman smiled and kissed my hand when leaving, telling me she understood what I had said and that she loved the words. I could but lift up my heart in prayer that the words might by the Holy Spirit be so grafted inwardly both in her, and their hearts, that they might bring forth fruit to God's glory.\n\nThe following day we passed through a heavily timbered country but mostly burnt. At many points we passed springs that overflowed the ice and snow and supplied us with refreshing drinks. Travelling on the run in winter is very thirsty work. The evening set in cold and windy, but our guide 'Strong paddle' selected a good camp among thick pine. He had us up two hours before daylight, for the toughest part of our journey. We had to cross 'the mountain' as the Indians call it. This necessitates crossing some very steep ravines, and sometimes sleighs, men and dogs would land at the bottom in a heap, the men only too glad if they escaped collision, in their rapid descent, with stems or stumps. Sandy Lake was reached that night, and we again slept in an Indian house. After supper several came in from adjoining houses and squatted on the floor, offering a deeply interesting congregation. The following evening we arrived at the mission. It stands on a height of land, facing the narrow channel and swamp that connects the two Wapuskaw lakes. The Mission house built of pine logs, has thirty feet area, including within its four walls dwelling rooms, Indian hall and school room. This serves to economise much labour and fuel.\n\nMr Weaver has about three acres fenced around the house and capable of cultivation. He has had to contend with great difficulties and has certainly done much more towards the completion of the building than seemed possible.\n\nWapuskaw is a unique little settlement in the very heart of the country, far removed from the ordinary routes of travel, accessible only by dog trains in winter and bark canoes in summer, on account of the swamps, muskegs and long portages that have to be traversed. Fish are plentiful in the numerous lakes.\n\nIt is a good fur country and deer are fairly plentiful. The first Sunday I was there, Feb 9th, we had a congregation of about forty people in the morn-\nDear Friends,\n\nI have just returned from an interesting and encouraging visit to Wapuskaw, our youngest Mission in the diocese.\n\nIt lies some 150 miles north and east of here. The journey had to be made with dogs. Our rate of travel averaged 30 miles a day.\n\nAccompanied by Mr. A. S. White and an Indian guide, I left here Feb 3rd. We proceeded down the Athabasca river about twelve miles.\n\nFrom this point we ascended to the height of land. Our road was a narrow track or trail cut through the woods calling for care and expert handling of the long narrow sleigh made of two flat strips of birch bound together with shaganappi, to prevent their gliding with the stems of trees and fallen trees.\n\nAbout six miles from the river we camped for the first night. Pine brush was laid where the snow had been cleared away and a bright fire rendered the situation much more comfortable than the cold, and falling snow seemed to render possible. The following morning we started about an hour before day-light.\n\nOur road lay over Muskeg making the travelling very rough. My sleigh was arranged so that I could ride when I liked. As I infinitely prefer depending on my own legs and was armed with a good pair of Loucheux snow-shoes, I burdened the dogs as little as possible. At times, however, I was thankful to ride as the pace of a good train of dogs keeps a man on the run the whole time. The Muskeg country terminated in what is called Muskeg Lake.\n\nBeyond this point the country is, or rather was densely wooded. With the exception of a few patches of unburnt timber the whole country is burnt out along the route we travelled. How wide an area of timber has been thus destroyed last summer, it would be hard to say. About sunset we came out on 'Calling-lake'. This is a fine sheet of water some eight miles in breadth and from ten to fifteen miles length. White fish of a good quality are caught by the Indians in this lake. There are about four families here occupying small log shanties on the northern bank. We camped at one of these houses. As far as personal comfort is concerned I much prefer to lay my blankets on the pine brush by the camp fire. On the other hand we received a kind welcome.\nI was promised the honor of the sole bedstead, while my companions slept on the floor. What was more to the point, I had an attentive audience of men and women to whom I set forth the way of salvation through Christ Jesus. One old Indian woman seized and kissed my hand when leaving, telling me she understood what I had said and that she loved the words. I could but lift up my heart in prayer that the words might by the Holy Spirit be so grafted inwardly both in her, and their hearts, that they might bring forth fruit to God's glory.\n\nThe following day we passed through a heavily timbered country but mostly barren. At many points we passed springs that overflowed the ice and snow and supplied us with refreshing drinks. Travelling on the run in winter is very thirsty work. The evening set in cold and windy, but our guide 'Strong paddle' selected a good camp among thick pine. He had us up two hours before daylight, for the toughest part of our journey. We had to cross 'the mountain' as the Indians call it. This necessitates crossing some very steep ravines, and sometimes sleighs, men and dogs would land at the bottom in a heap, the men only too glad if they escaped collision, in their rapid descent, with stems or stumps. 'Sandy Lake' was reached that night, and we again slept in an Indian house. After supper several came in from adjoining houses and squatted on the floor, offering a deeply interesting congregation. The following evening we arrived at the mission. It stands on a height of land, facing the narrow channel and swamp that connects the two Wapuskaw lakes. The Mission house built of pine logs, has thirty feet area, including within its four walls, dwelling rooms, Indian hall and school room. This serves to economise much labour and fuel.\n\nMr Weaver has about three acres fenced around the house and capable of cultivation. He has had to contend with great difficulties and has certainly done much more towards the completion of the building than seemed possible.\n\nWapuskaw is a unique little settlement in the very heart of the country, far removed from the ordinary routes of travel, accessible only by dog trains in winter and bark canoes in summer, on account of the swamps, muskegs and long portages that have to be traversed. Fish are plentiful in the numerous lakes.\n\nIt is a good fur country and deer are fairly plentiful. The first Sunday I was there, Feb 9th, we had a congregation of about forty people in the morn-\ning and nearly the same number in the afternoon. At the latter service I baptised four adults and three children. The following Tuesday I started with Mr. Weaver to visit a sick Indian across the further lake. The cold was severe on the open lake and the trip took us the best part of a day. We were well repaid however by the eagerness with which he drank in the message of a Saviour's love. He was evidently far gone in consumption and could only speak in a whisper. He asked for me to sit close by his side while one of his friends propped him up. When unable to sit up longer he would be laid down on his pillow, only to ask to be lifted up again to hear more. As the husband of more than one wife I postponed baptizing him until the Rev G. Holmes's arrival who being a fluent Cree speaker could fully explain to him the Christian rule. Unfortunately Mr Holmes's arrival was delayed and the day we had arranged to revisit him we heard of his death.\n\nMr Holmes arrived on the following Friday and the tale he had to tell is a sad commentary on these poor Indians unenlightened by the Gospel.\n\nWe had heard last November at the Landing of a Soto Indian who was practising medicine with the usual accompaniments of drumming and pretended intercourse with Spirits at one of these lakes called Moose Lake. He foretold that a Wetigo should arise that would destroy every one who did not join his religion and come and place themselves under his protection. Many families appear to have done so. It created a general terror and uneasiness through the country. The hunters dare not go out to their hunting grounds with their families. The Indians have a great terror of these so called Wetigoos or Cannibals, they believe that after eating human flesh their heart becomes a lump of ice and no one's life is safe from them. Absurd as all this seems to us, it is a real terror to the untutored Indian. Dim shadowy terrors, nursed amid the silence and solitudes of the woods, beset them on every side.\n\nA Wapuskaw Indian started with his wife and children for Trout Lake in January. The account of what happened Mr Holmes had from the wife. At their last camp before reaching Trout Lake, her husband who appeared quite well and ate his supper, suddenly said to his wife \"See look at that!\" it is coming to me\". He crouched under his blanket and from that moment was a lunatic.\nHe told his wife that one of the children looked to him like a young moose and he wanted to kill and eat it. The woman sat up all night not daring to lie down lest he should kill the children or her. Fancy the poor woman alone in the solitude of those dreary woods through all that terrible night!\n\nNext day she proposed that he should go ahead while she drove the dogs. He consented for awhile and then suddenly stopped, saying that something stopped him and would not let him go on. She had then to go ahead.\n\nFinally they reached Trout lake. The people in their terror left their homes and crowded into two buildings in one of which the supposed Wetigoo was placed. They all thought that he was the cannibal the Soto Indian had been prophesying should arise. They appear to have been in a state of abject terror.\n\nHe was with them nineteen days. They bound him with cords but these he snapped in his frenzy. Finally his own father advocated his being put to death.\n\nThey prevailed on an Indian who had the reputation of being a Medicine man to do the deed. According to their statement he was very unwilling and at first refused. At length on their repeated solicitations and the expression of their conviction that otherwise, as the predicted cannibal, he would destroy them, he struck him on the head with his axe. But it required a third stroke before the poor madman lay a corpse at their feet. Mr Holmes stated on his arrival there he found them still in terror. They had piled huge logs over his grave and dare not leave the two houses into which with their families they were crowded. The poor woman with her two children wished to return to Wapuskaw under Mr Holmes's care. She drove her own dogs; Mr H. lending her one of his robes to keep the children from freezing. On reaching camp that night they found that both her legs were badly frozen above the knees and they had to leave her and her children at an Indian's house which they reached the following evening. Before leaving Wapuskaw the father had expressed his intention of putting his two children to school with us. When the mother returns we shall, I trust, have the poor children. If some friends of the cause would only support the children, I feel sure that the blessing of him who is 'the Father of the fatherless and the husband of the widow' will be theirs. We have now seven Indian children at the school fed and clothed. We have no Government\ngrant whatever, nor help from any source for their support other than the kind gifts that come to this Mission in the bales. The mischief I am sorry to say may not stop at the killing of this man; a brother of his has been brooding over the sad occurrence. He has been telling his fellow Indians that his brother comes to him in his sleep. They in their turn are frightened lest he too should go out of his mind. Some however of his friends have come under Christian instruction and he himself has been wishful for some time past for baptism.\n\nHis immediate relations including his own wife had driven him from their camp, but old John and Peter two leading Indians at Wapuskaw and Christian men, befriended him and the second Sunday I was there, he came forward and I had the pleasure of baptizing him. This and the kind Christian counsel, Mr Holmes was so well able to give him in his own language, will, I trust, under God dispel the gloom. You will see from above that Wapuskaw is a stronghold of heathen darkness and superstition and that in planting a Mission there we have chosen a spot that sorely needs the converting, enlightening and humanizing power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It is an interesting fact that on the headland on which our Mission now stands, in clearing the bush, Mr Weaver found one of their heathen 'munetokans' or idols; a stump of poplar carved into the rough semblance of a head and shoulders, painted with red earth, and with three black horizontal stripes on the breast. I brought the interesting relic back with me to the landing.\n\nThe week before I started we had our little Printing press going almost night and day, as I wanted to take out some little books printed in the Cree Syllabic. In undertaking this work my wish is; firstly - to put into the hands of the Indians small books they can easily carry about with them. Secondly by printing in large type (Pica) syllabics, to enable them to read by the flickering light of their camp fires. Thirdly by omitting the breathings, punctuations, marks of emphasis &c, in general use very helpful to the English learner, but of no use at all to the Indian, to simplify the characters just as they use them in writing their letters. This our first trial, consisted of selected passages of Scripture, Prayers and Hymns. It was a great pleasure to me to hear many of them read the books thus printed without difficulty or hesitation. All were asking for a\ncopy, but we only gave to those who could read. The syllabarium is attached so that they can teach one another.\n\nOn Sunday Feb 16, in the presence of the Indians, I admitted the Rev C. Weaver to Priest's orders assisted by the Rev G. Holmes.\n\nAs Mr Weaver becomes more acquainted with their language, I feel sure that he will exercise a strong influence over the Indians and I trust, that the light which is just beginning to gleam in the surrounding darkness, will shine more and more unto the perfect day.\n\nI remain\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nAthabasca Landing\nFebruary 24th 1896.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6377)\n\nFile 766-10, part 1\nLesser Slave Lake Agency - Vermillion -\nR.C.
