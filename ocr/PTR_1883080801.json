It is a natural instinct, and one that cannot be denied. The act of kissing is a sign of affection and love, and it is a way of expressing these feelings in a physical manner.\n\nThe act of kissing is not just limited to humans. Many animals also engage in kissing behavior. For example, dogs often lick each other's faces as a sign of affection. This behavior is similar to human kissing, where the lips are used to convey love and affection.\n\nIn conclusion, kissing is a natural and healthy way of expressing love and affection. It is a sign of connection and intimacy between two people.\nTHE PRINCE ALBERT TIMES\n\nAND\n\nSASKATCHEWAN REVIEW.\n\nThe Leading Weekly Paper in the Province.\n\n$2.50 PER ANNUM.\n\n\"The Times\" Contains all Original Matter.\n\nAdvertise in \"The Times.\"\n\nAnd have your Advertisement read by all.\n\nReplete with Local and General News.\n\nSubscribe!
