H. V. Bulyea, Esq., M.L.A.,\nCommissioner of Public Works.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit the Annual Report of the Department of Public Works of the North-West Territories for the year 1904.\n\nThe increase and extension in the work of the department, referred to in the last annual report, has continued, which will be found from the detailed information in the following pages. This increase was to be expected from the rapid increase of settlement and extension of the areas within which the department has been called upon to perform public works during the season.\n\nThe damage to and destruction of bridges and roads in Eastern Assiniboia, owing to floods caused by melting snow in the latter part of April and May, which completely destroyed a very large number of the old structures, necessitated a very considerable expenditure for new bridges of a much more substantial class than heretofore constructed in the locality mentioned, and a generally favourable season for such works permitted of replacing practically all structures destroyed and completing a large number of other new structures necessitated by the extension of settlement and extension of railways, and while it was not possible to comply with all requests or meet all the requirements, it will be noted that a very much larger number of bridges were constructed or reconstructed than in previous years. The system of putting in steel superstructures as far as possible to meet the expenditure has been followed and an effort made to use concrete substructures in preference to piling and timber. The bridges over the Old Man river near Macleod and the Belly river near Lethbridge were both during the year completed on this class of substructures and the construction of bridge over Bow river near Morley was undertaken and well advanced at the end of the year on the same lines. The replacing of piling and timber substructures supporting some of the older steel bridges with concrete should be carried steadily along to avoid too much of this work coming on at one time, and where possible permanent concrete substructures should be placed in all streams to carry the steel superstructures. It has, however, been impossible, owing to the limited season for the performances of such work, limited means and the fact that bridges had to be provided without delay, to put in as much permanent work as we would like to have done, consequently piling has been used and concrete will be a later consideration. Where conditions are favourable concrete or tile pipe should be used for the smaller sized culverts in connection with road construction, its first cost not exceeding very much that of timber in many localities.\n\nA large amount of road improvements was carried on both in large and small local improvement districts, but in the latter particularly an effort was made to concentrate the improvements on leading trails just as far as possible, it being evident that expenditures on such works, outside of what the local improvement districts are able to perform, should, as\nfar as possible, be made upon leading trails or roads, with a view of benefiting the largest number of settlers for the expenditure. Generally dry and favourable weather for road work in the latter part of the season, while improving the general condition of roads, also permitted of undertaking improvements where not possible to advantageously do so during the wet seasons, had funds been available for the purpose.\n\nAgreements with the railway companies re fireguarding along their lines, entered into in 1902 and carried on for two seasons, were terminated at the end of 1903, the companies continuing the work of maintaining fireguards during 1904. Fireguards outside of these along railway lines were maintained as in previous seasons, and while these guards have not in all cases turned or stopped the fires, the protection given seems to amply warrant the expenditure.\n\nDry weather through the latter part of the season has again brought up strongly the question of shortage of water in several localities, and the six drilling machines owned by the department were operated steadily up to the end of the year with varied success, and while the percentage of wells in which from fair to good supplies of water were obtained is encouraging, admittedly, the number and class of machines owned by the department is entirely inadequate to meet the requirements, and in localities where supply of water can be obtained at a reasonable depth, the settlers will, undoubtedly, have to make more effort to supply themselves, as we have on hand at present applications that would keep all the machines fully employed during 1905. There are, however, certain areas where supply has rarely, if ever, been found by the tests made down to 400 or 500 feet, and I would be inclined to advise the purchase of a 2500 to 3000 foot machine for the purpose of making tests in such localities, such tests only to be undertaken in organised districts where the local authorities are willing to contribute largely to the expense outside of the first cost of the machine.\n\nThe areas organised under the new Local Improvement Ordinance up to the end of the year is very gratifying, and generally speaking the councils have shown a marked interest in looking after their own local affairs, which has resulted in a lot of good work being done, besides placing the department in a position to deal with the council as a body representing the district in preference to the confusion that generally arises when aiming to deal with public improvements on private requests and recommendations. Petitions for organisation now on hand point to a largely increased organisation of local improvement districts during 1905, and it is confidently hoped that this organisation will be the first step in a system of fuller local control of the many small questions, which it is practically impossible to deal satisfactorily with from one central point in view of the large area over which settlement is spreading.\n\nThe total expenditure incurred by the department during the year on public works and paid out of general revenue amounted to $611,417.77, some $239,197.77 more than was expended from this source in 1903, and while this sum includes payment for certain works completed in 1903, at least an equal amount will be paid in 1905 for works completed in 1904. For the purpose of comparison with the expenditure of former years and of showing the growth of the annual expenditure of the department, the following table, compiled from former reports, is appended.\nExpenditure in 1899 ........................................ $146,403\n\" \" 1900 .................................................. 175,960\n\" \" 1901 .................................................. 236,574\n\" \" 1902 .................................................. 298,238\n\" \" 1903 .................................................. 372,220\n\" \" 1904 .................................................. 611,417\n\nShowing that in 1904 $465,014 was expended over and above the amount expended in 1899. On a percentage basis the expenditure of 1900 was 20.19 per cent. above that of 1899 that of 1901 \" 34.45 \" \" 1900\n\" 1902 \" 26.06 \" \" 1901\n\" 1903 \" 31.51 \" \" 1902\n\" 1904 \" 64.26 \" \" 1903\n\" 1904 \" 317.62 \" \" 1899\n\nFor the sake of uniformity the system adopted in the preparation of former reports will be followed as nearly as possible throughout this report with the exception that since the small local improvement districts have been disorganised by the new ordinance which came into effect on the 1st of January, 1904, there will in consequence be no list of overseers of local improvement districts, but instead, a list of the districts organised during 1904 is appended, showing their area and the names of the secretary-treasurers.\n\nCORRESPONDENCE BRANCH.\n\nStaff .......................................................... { 1 chief clerk.\n\" \" ......................................................... 4 clerks.\n\" \" ......................................................... 1 messenger.\n\nThe following statement will show the large amount of correspondence handled by this branch during the year, also a marked increase over former years:\n\nCommunications received, 1902 ........................................ 42,251\n\" \" 1903 .................................................. 46,306\n\" \" 1904 .................................................. 75,264\nCommunications sent, 1902 ........................................ 86,730\n\" \" 1903 .................................................. 88,304\n\" \" 1904 .................................................. 147,691\nIrrigation Office, 1902 ........................................ 3,417\n\" \" 1903 .................................................. 3,519\n\" \" 1904 .................................................. 5,548\n\" \" special circulars, 1904 .................................... 3,500\nTotal, 1902 .................................................. 132,398\n\" \" 1903 .................................................. 140,929\n\" \" 1904 .................................................. 232,003\nAverage number dealt with daily, 1902 .................................... 431\n\" \" \" \" 1903 .................................................. 463\n\" \" \" \" 1904 .................................................. 761\nEntries of cash received, 1902 ........................................ 9,651\n\" \" \" \" 1903 .................................................. 10,429\n\" \" \" \" 1904 .................................................. 18,468\nThis shows an increase of communications received and sent over and above 1903 of 91,074, or a daily average of 761 communications handled by the department.\n\nTHE COAL MINES REGULATIONS ORDINANCE.\n\nInside staff ........................................... 1 clerk and stenographer.\nOutside staff ........................................... 1 inspector.\n\nFive new coal mines were opened up during the year of which the department has been notified and the following schedule shows the mines which have been operated in the Territories of which we have a record in the department:\n\nOutput of Coal during the Year 1904.\n\nBituminous and lignite coal .................................. 759,568 tons\nAnthracite coal ............................................. 23,363 \".\n\nTotal ...................................................... 782,931 \"\n\nIt will be observed that the total output of bituminous and lignite coal exceeds that of 1903 by 141,814 tons, being an increase of about 22.95% on these two classes. The increase in the production of anthracite to 18,178 tons over last year's output is accounted for by the operation of Bankhead mines at Banff.\n\nSCHEDULE of Accidents in Coal Mines in 1904.\n\n| LOCATION | Character of Accident |\n|----------|-----------------------|\n|          | Resulting in death | Serious injury | Slight injury | Total of accidents |\n| Blairmore | 1                   |               |               | 1                  |\n| Canmore   | 1                   |               |               | 1                  |\n| Coalfields| 2                   | 1             | 1             | 4                  |\n| Coleman   | 1                   |               | 4             | 5                  |\n| Edmonton  | 1                   |               | 1             | 2                  |\n| Estevan   |                     |               |               | 1                  |\n| Frank     | 3                   |               |               | 3                  |\n| Lethbridge| 3                   | 1             |               | 4                  |\n| Lubreck   | 2                   |               |               | 2                  |\n\nTotal in Territories: 6 10 7 23\n\nMINES opened in 1904.\n\n| NAME                | LOCATION    | OPERATED BY         | CHARACTER OF COAL |\n|---------------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Stewart Coal Co.    | Edmonton    | Stewart Coal Co.    | Bituminous        |\n| Nonsuch             | Clover Bar  | O.

STOCKS, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina, Assa.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour of presenting my report as Inspector of Coal Mines for the North-West Territories, for the year ending the 31st of December, 1904. Taking up the subjects as required by the Lieutenant Governor in Council in the appointment of an inspector under sections 34 and 35 of the Coal Mines Regulations Ordinance, No. 9, 1898.\n\nThe output of the coal mines in the Territories has considerably increased during the past year, and the number of mines added to the list is five. The total number of mines that have been opened since a tabulated list was compiled by the department is ninety-three (93). A short summary of the statistics for 1904 is as follows:\n\nNumber of Mines opened in the district ........................................... 93\n\" \" known to be in operation .................................................. 51\n\" \" tons produced in 1904 ...................................................... 782,931\n\" \" persons employed in the mines ........................................... 1,482\n\" \" persons employed outside the mines .................................... 537\n\" \" fatal accidents in the mines ............................................... 5\n\" \" fatal accidents outside the mines ....................................... 1\n\nThe following companies have been the largest producers during the past year:\n\nThe Alberta Railway & Irrigation Co.\u2014Lethbridge, Alta. No. 3 shaft.\nThe Canadian-American Coal and Coke Co.\u2014Frank, Alta. No. 1 entry, No. 2 entry and No. 3 shaft.\nThe West Canadian Colliers, Ltd.\u2014Blairmore, Alta. Nos. 1, 2 and 3 entries at Little Colliery. No. 1, entry at Bellyue Colliery.\nThe International Mining and Coke Co.\u2014Coleman, Alta. No. 1 entry and No. 1 slope.\nThe H. W. McNeill Co.\u2014Canmore, Alta. No. 1 slope.\nThe H. W. McNeill Co.\u2014Anthracite, Alta. No. 1 slope (now abandoned).\nThe Souris Coal Co.\u2014Coalfields, Assa. Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 entries, and No. 1 slope.\nThe C.P.R. Mining and Metallurgical Dept.\u2014Bankhead, Alta. Nos. 1, 2 and 3 entries and No. 1 slope.\nThe C.P.R. Mining and Metallurgical Dept.\u2014Bienfait, Assa. No. 1 slope.\nThe Breckenridge-Lund Coal Co.\u2014Lubrek, Alta. No. 1 entry.\nThe Eureka Brick & Coal Co.\u2014Estevan, Assa. No. 2 entry.\nThe Roche Percee Coal Mining Co., Ltd.\u2014Roche Percee, Assa. No. 1 entry.\nThe Edmonton Coal Co.\u2014Edmonton, Alta. Nos. 1 and 2 entries.\nThe Mays Coal Mining Co.\u2014Edmonton, Alta. Nos. 1, 2 and 3 entries.\nThe James R. Stewart Mining Co.\u2014Edmonton, Alta. Nos. 1 and 2 entries.\nThe Knee Hill Coal Co.\u2014Knee Hill, Alta. No. 1 entry.\n\nThere are many other individual coal mine operators who have produced a fair output in the Edmonton, Estevan, High River, Crows Nest and Medicine Hat districts, which are all included in the total of the Territories for 1904. Quite a few small mines are in operation\nin outlying districts that have not as yet been visited, and in some cases I think, no returns have been made; this I consider an oversight on the part of the operators, as the more publicity that is given to their districts, the more resources they will be the community to eventually consume their product. The Alberta Railway and Irrigation Co. have changed their title during the past year, eliminating the word \"Coal,\" but this far from being a sign of the company going out of the coal market, has seemingly given a new impetus to them, as their coal production this year exceeds any previous one.\n\nThe hoisting plant at this colliery, although a comparatively old one, will be hard to beat in any coal field; the record was reached this year when over 2,000 tons of material was hoisted in ten hours. The ventilating plant has been relieved to a certain extent by a connection being made to No. 4 shaft.\n\nThe endless rope haulage has been extended to suit the requirements of the colliery; a new box car loader was installed but did not prove suitable to handling the class of coal.\n\nOther improvements have been made on the plant in proportion to the increased output.\n\nThe Canadian-American Coal & Coke Co. have within the past twelve months overcome the difficulties that beset them after the terrible landslide of April, 1903, which practically wiped out their whole plant. The old entry has now been thoroughly opened out with good connections to the surface; a new fan installed and now the company are busy putting in a main and tail rope haulage, also a box car loader to facilitate shipments. All the work at the new shaft has been completed and ready for hoisting coal.\n\nNo. 2 Adit Level on the north side of the railway, has for the present been stopped as they can supply their demands with the present workings.\n\nThe West Canadian Collieries, Ltd., have made an amalgamation of three properties, viz.\u2014at Lille, Bellvue and Bryron Creek.\n\nAt Lille their work is now concentrated at No. 1 opening where a new tipple plant has recently been erected. The small coal from this colliery is all coked, the production of the ovens being over 100 tons per day.\n\nAt this company's Bellvue colliery development work has already progressed during the past year, that now they are capable of giving an output of 400 tons per day.\n\nBryron Creek Colliery has been closed for the present as all prospecting work has been completed.\n\nThe International Coal and Coke Co. has one of the model plants in the district. This mine although opened little more than a year ago is one of the large coal producers in the Pass. All their railway sidings have been completed, the tipple plant with hoisting arrangements, self-dumping cages and screening apparatus to place coal on the market for domestic, steam and coking use. Their ventilating fan with electric motive power is capable of producing 150,000 cubic feet of air per minute. A high pressure compound air plant has been completed by which their 7 ton air locomotive can be charged at three separate points and capable of drawing 30 loads on a \u00bd per cent. grade. This is the first air locomotive that has been introduced in the district and is proving a\ngreat success. The main entry is in about 3,000 feet driven in a 14 foot seam and about 1,000 feet in this gangway the measures have been cross-cut to a 6 foot seam which is an excellent coking coal.\n\nA slope has been driven on this 6 foot seam to attain greater depth of working.\n\nThe H. W. McNeill Co., at their Canmore mines have been working steadily all year and their output will exceed the production of any previous year. The development of the mine has been carried vigorously until the production for one day is over 600 tons.\n\nMany new improvements have been made at this colliery during the past year so as to improve the quality of the coal put on the market, and also to facilitate quicker shipping.\n\nA new Phillips tipple has been built with creeper chain to bring the cars back to the top of the slope. After the coal has been dumped it is passed over shaker screens, and the lump and small elevated separated over picking tables at the end of which they are dumped together into large hoppers or coal bins. The coal from this mine is nearly all used for steam purposes, and the loading from these large coal bins can be done much quicker than by the old method of straight dumping into the box cars. The company are now erecting a new fan capable of producing 100,000 cubic feet of air per minute, which will allow of the workings being extended to a much greater distance than they are at present.\n\nThe H. W. McNeill Co., at Anthra cite closed down this mine in June last on account of litigation with the adjoining property.\n\nThe Souris Coal Co., have again increased their output to what it was in former years, and no doubt the way in which this coal is taking the market through Estevan, Assiniboia and Manitoba, the increase will come year by year. The Company have now taken a wise step and started to open up a slope about the centre of their property and so concentrate all their work at one point.\n\nA modern hoisting and tipple plant is to be erected at these new works.\n\nThe C.P.R. Mining and Metallurgical Dept. have put in a modern plant at Bienfait, Assa. The work here, however, has only been development, but executed in such a manner that should the other collieries in the district not be able to supply the demand then rooms can be immediately opened out and the production made equal to the demand.\n\nThe C.R.R. Mining and Metallurgical Dept. at Bankhead Mine, five miles from Banff, has pushed ahead the development work of their mines, erected a very large and modern plant and for the comfort of their employees have built one of the most modern mining villages on the continent. The mine is situated at the base of Cascade Mts., the seams having a general strike north and south, with a pitch varying from 40\u00b0 to 75\u00b0 dipping to the west. No. 2 gangway is in over 2,000 feet with very little sign of faulting. The main tunnel, at which point the permanent tipple plant is to be erected has now been connected with No. 2 seam and started again to crosscut the measures to tap all the other seams. The ventilation at present is by exhaust fan, capable of handling the work for some time but new and more powerful fans have been ordered so that each seam as it is developed will be ventilated separately.\n\nThe Breckenridge Lund Coal Co., have done considerable development work during the past year, and are now preparing to put up a new scientific plant alongside of the railway tracks.\nThe Eureka Brick and Coal Co., also the Roche Perce Coal Mining Co. are fastly developing the lignite field of South Estevan.\n\nThe Edmonton Coal Co., The Mays Coal Mining Co. and the James R. Stewart Mining Co. all operating in the Edmonton district are the pioneers of what must soon be a larger company probably an amalgamation of interests.\n\nThe Knee Hills Coal Co. Knee Hill, Alta. These mines although worked for a few years past in a desultory manner to supply a few ranchers the country is now filling up so fast that the company have now taken the matter up seriously and will develop accordingly until a railroad reaches them which should be in the near future.\n\nAccidents.\n\nThe record of accidents fatal and non-fatal is, I think, more complete as far as statistics are concerned than in any previous year.\n\nThe tonnage output of the Territories has largely increased during 1904 and consequently the number of men employed has proportionately increased; I am pleased to say that the accidents have not increased in the same proportion although more minor accidents have been reported, this is more on account of the different managements taking more cognisance to our mining regulations.\n\nIn this connection I would respectfully draw your attention to the introduction of some amendments in our Coal Mines Regulations Ordinance, especially with regard to ambulance work.\n\nAppended is a tabulated statement of the accidents which have been reported in 1904.\n| NO | DATE       | NAME             | DESCRIPTION                                      |\n|----|------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | Jan. 23    | David Arroyo     | Laborer                                         |\n|    |            | Sours No. 2      | Leg broken; crushed between illoe ear and neck pant post |\n| 2  | Feb. 23    | Fred Basista     | Laborer                                         |\n|    |            | James Parentemane| Slightly injured by fall from roof                 |\n| 3  | Mar. 24    | Steve Bumbute    | Laborer                                         |\n|    |            | Hubert Matlo \u0422\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0438  | Slightly injured by fall of work                 |\n| 4  | Apr. 24    | Francois Mire     | Laborer                                         |\n|    |            | Oscalie Rose     | Double fracture collar; fell off rock tears           |\n| 5  | Jun. 15    | Antonio Reyes Jr.| Labroear                                         |\n|    |            | Jose Tornanste   | Truly injured by shot                            |\n| 6  | Jul. 13-24 | Samuel Howard    | Severely injured face and nose                    |\n| 7  | Aug. 1     | Frank Chicken      | Laborer peque\u00f1a                                  |\n|    |            | Michl Montchoinie| Severely injured mantle                           |\n| 8  | Sep. 3     | Julien Grindneri   | Laborer                                         |\n|    |            | Stephan Finisheru | Severally injured poss.\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641 km                    |\n| 9  | Junle 14    | Antonio Reyes Jr.| Labroear                                       |\n|    |            | H.

The large extent of territory and the number of mines to be visited now occupies much more time than it did during previous years, and on this account I find it more advantageous to visit the extensive collieries oftener and so keep in touch with their development.\n\nOn these occasions the plans are examined, certain districts, mapped out to go to but visiting the main intake and main returns always. Here again I would respectfully ask you if possible at the next session of the Legislature that amendments be introduced into the Ordinance which amendments would greatly facilitate my work of inspection. My reports of inspection have been made to the department after each visit to a colliery and then all details as to the workings have been gone into. This past year I have taken up the statistics of the different collieries with regard to ventilation, pumping, haulage, rails used, modes of working, lights used, machinery, etc., and have them tabulated for information of the department at any time; the quality of the coal in the different districts I also looked up, and the following is an approximate analysis of the same.\n\n**Crows Nest District.**\n\n|                | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     |\n|----------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Moisture       | 0\u00b785  | 2\u00b790  | 0\u00b777  | 1\u00b78   |\n| Vol. com. matter | 21\u00b715 | 20\u00b72  | 19\u00b758 | 27\u00b71  |\n| Fixed carbon   | 68\u00b746 | 69\u00b72  | 73\u00b762 | 63\u00b78  |\n| Ash            | 9\u00b725  | 8\u00b76   | 5\u00b780  | 0\u00b73   |\n| Sulphur        | 0\u00b731  | Trace | 0\u00b723  | 1\u00b70   |\n\nAll coking\n\n**Cowley District.**\n\n|                |       |\n|----------------|-------|\n| Moisture       | 3\u00b77   |\n| Vol. com. matter | 53\u00b76  |\n| Fixed carbon   | 31\u00b78  |\n| Ash            | 10\u00b79  |\n\n**Lethbridge District.**\n\n|                |       |\n|----------------|-------|\n| Moisture       | 7\u00b742  |\n| Vol. com. matter | 43\u00b783 |\n| Fixed carbon   | 44\u00b792 |\n| Ash            | 3\u00b783  |\n\n**Souris District.**\n\n|                |       |\n|----------------|-------|\n| Moisture       | 16\u00b792 |\n| Vol. com. matter | 38\u00b758 |\n| Fixed carbon   | 40\u00b772 |\n| Ash            | 3\u00b778  |\n\n**Canmore and Bankhead.**\n\n|                | 1     | 2     | 1     |\n|----------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Moisture       | 1\u00b745  | 1\u00b76   | 4\u00b71   |\n| Vol. com. matter | 13\u00b701 | 14\u00b77  | 12\u00b700 |\n| Fixed carbon   | 84\u00b704 | 79\u00b79  | 83\u00b778 |\n| Ash            | 2\u00b750  | 4\u00b77   | 3\u00b781  |\nExaminations.\n\nThe work in connection with examinations was increasing so rapidly that it has been decided to hold them only twice a year, dividing the Territories into three separate districts, Canmore, Crows Nest and Coalfields. The applicants for the different certificates in 1904 were so numerous that seven examinations had to be held, and of these 16 passed for fire boss, 10 for pit boss and 4 for mines manager's certificate.\n\nDuring the year I had several complaints from mine managers with regard to the incompetency or lack of getting good officials, so that I have been compelled to entirely cancel all the old examination papers and each examination will now be different from the previous one. In the case of pit boss or fire boss the board of examiners reserve the right to give these candidates a thorough *viva voce* examination. It is pleasing to note the interest that is now taken by the miners to pass these examinations, each one seeming to strive with the other to see who will receive the largest percentage. Some of the papers examined this year by the various boards have surpassed anything that was ever before presented to them. Many of these certificated men have not the Ordinance and I think it would be wise to include this in the annual report sending a copy to each official on the department's list.\n\nCoal Mining Prospects.\n\nThe prospecting and location of the new coal areas in the Territories is still vigorously carried on.\n\nThe eye of the public has been so favourably attracted by the bright prospects of the future Territories that there is no trouble in securing capital to develop any reliable company's holdings.\n\nAll the different coal districts show a remarkable increase in population and the companies operating in them are certainly keeping up their improvements to meet the increased demand.\n\nI have the honour to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank B. Smith,\nInspector of Coal Mines.\n\n---\n\nThe Steam Boilers Ordinance.\n\nInside staff .......... .......... .......... .......... 1 clerk in charge\nOutside staff .......... .......... .......... .......... 4 inspectors\n\nAs in previous reports, it will be observed that this year there is an increase in all sections of work connected with The Steam Boilers Ordinance.\n\nThe staff of inspectors remains the same as last year with one exception, and in this instance a new appointment was made. Inspector W. M. Carment, appointed March 22nd, 1900, tendered his resignation on May 31st, 1904, but owing to the difficulty in obtaining another inspector, it was not possible to relieve him from duty until August 4th. Mr. Carment was in his fifth year of service as an inspector, and during the whole of this time performed his duties in an entirely satisfactory\nmanner. Between the first of the year and the date of his leaving the service Mr. Carment inspected 119 boilers, and held a number of examinations for engineers.\n\nTo fill the vacancy on the staff caused by Mr. Carment's resignation, Mr. David Fraser, of Strathcona, was appointed. He commenced his duties in the South-eastern Assiniboia District, but later returned to Strathcona, as owing to the large increase in the amount of work to be done in Alberta, his services were found necessary to take over the northern part of Inspector Buxton's district, and he has been permanently appointed to that portion of the Territories.\n\nThe following are the names and addresses of the Inspectors:\n\n- Wm. Waller ........................................... Whitewood\n- Wm. Mayhew ........................................... Whitewood\n- Jos. Buxton ........................................... Calgary\n- David Fraser ........................................... Strathcona\n\nSome changes were made in allotting inspectors to different districts than they had previously covered. On this account the increase in the number of boilers inspected does not appear as marked as last year, although from data in the hands of the inspectors it is known that the number of boilers in the Territories is increasing very rapidly. There is still one district to which no inspector has been appointed to devote his whole time, but it is in the hands of Inspector Mayhew, who has the North-eastern Assiniboia District, until a new appointment can be made.\n\nThe schedule given below shows the ground covered during the past year in connection with the administration of this Ordinance. It also draws a comparison between the work of the year 1903 and 1904:\n\n|                                      | 1903 | 1904 | Increase |\n|--------------------------------------|------|------|----------|\n| Number of boilers inspected          | 1125 | 1192 | 67       |\n| Number of examinations of engineers held | 178  | 261  | 83       |\n| Number of first class engineer's certificates issued | 5    | 5    |          |\n| Number of second class engineer's certificates issued | 39   | 58   | 19       |\n| Number of third class engineer's certificates issued | 144  | 199  | 55       |\n| Number of provisional certificates of qualification issued | 410  | 583  | 173      |\n| Number of permits for operation of steam boilers issued | 42   | 49   | 7        |\n\nFees collected:\n- For inspection of boilers .................. $5,680.00 $6,250.00 $570.00\n- For final certificates under section 28 .... 87.00\n- For examination of engineers .............. 663.00 73.00 207.00\n- For provisional certificates ............... 1,242.00 1,740.00 504.00\n- For permits for operation of steam boilers | 126.00 | 147.00 | 21.00 |\n\nTotals ........................................... $7,711.00 $9,013.00 $1,302.00\n\nIn addition to the certificates recorded in the above schedule as issued, some 28 second provisional certificates have been issued, under subsection 2 of Section 29, to engineers who failed to pass their examination for a final certificate.\n\nIt will be observed that the number of final certificates issued is small compared with the issue of provisional certificates.\nThere has been an increase of $1,302.00 in the amount of revenue collected.\n\nIt is very gratifying to be able to report that no accident has occurred during the past year, for which the condition of a boiler is accountable, although there are nearly twelve hundred in operation.\n\nThe annual reports of the staff of inspectors, and a list of all Final Certificates issued to date, are submitted herewith:\n\nWHITEWOOD, December 31st, 1904.\n\nJOHN STOCKS, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina, Assa.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit my annual report as Inspector of Steam Boilers for the year 1904 in accordance with Section 19 of The Steam Boilers Ordinance.\n\nThe number of boilers inspected by me during the past year is 285, which may be classed as follows:\n\n| Type                  | Number |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Locomotive traction   | 140    |\n| \" portable            | 65     |\n| Return tube, traction | 32     |\n| \" portable            | 28     |\n| Stationary tubular    | 17     |\n| \" vertical            | 3      |\n| **Total**             | **285**|\n\nConditions of Boilers.\n\n| Condition | Number |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Good      | 245    |\n| Very fair | 21     |\n| Fair      | 17     |\n| Poor      | 1      |\n| Bad       | 1      |\n\nThe last one I condemned as unfit for further use. Repairs were ordered on 35 boilers; new steam gauges on 3 and new safety valves on 4. In all 71 boilers came in during the year of which 57 were new, and 14 had been in use before.\n\nAt the end of July I was transferred from the South-eastern to the North-eastern Assiniboia District through the resignation of Mr. W. M. Carment of Yorkton. Up to that time I had inspected 146 boilers, and since being transferred I have inspected 139.\n\nI have held 22 advertised examinations, and others I have had to arrange as I was passing through my district to accommodate engineers living at a distance from the towns, as they say they do not know of the examinations being held until it is too late. I have held these examinations to assist in supplying the need of certificated engineers as owing to the large increase in the number of boilers every year the demand for certificated men is not kept up with.\n\nI have no accidents or casualties to report in my district during the past year.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M. MAYHEW,\nInspector of Steam Boilers,\nStrathcona, December 31st, 1904.\n\nJohn Stocks, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina, Assa.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit to you my annual report as Inspector of Steam Boilers for the year 1904 in accordance with Section 19 of the provisions of The Steam Boilers Ordinance.\n\nI commenced my duties in North Alberta on the 27th of August, and on the 19th of September was assigned the South-eastern District of Assiniboia as my field of work. During the season I inspected 131 boilers. Of that number 49 were new and 5 had been brought into the district from other places.\n\nThe number of the different classes and their condition are as follows:\n\n- Locomotive fire box ........................................... 102\n- Return tubular .................................................. 15\n- Horizontal tubular ............................................... 13\n- Upright tubular .................................................. 1\n\nOf this number 125 were in good condition, and six in fair condition. Various repairs were ordered in nine boilers, also three new safety valves, and two steam gauges.\n\nOwing to the scarcity of engineers during the threshing season, I had to issue seven permits to people who could not get men with certificates. I received application for 44 provisional certificates. I held an examination in Strathcona and also at five different points in Assiniboia, where 44 candidates wrote for final certificates.\n\nThere have been no accidents or casualties reported to me during the season.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDavid Fraser,\nInspector of Steam Boilers.\n\nWhitewood, December 31st, 1904.\n\nJohn Stocks, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina, Assa.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit to you my fifth annual report as Inspector of Steam Boilers.\n\nAs in previous years I was instructed to proceed to Battleford to overhaul the steam ferry and put the boat in the water, which was done successfully. Owing to the ice jam and the sudden rise of the water at the same time, the work of caulking the boat was delayed. The ferry was running on May 7th, after which I commenced the inspection of steam boilers in the Battleford district.\n\nThe number of boilers is increasing very rapidly. I have inspected 326 boilers during 1904. Of this number 50 had not been inspected before as far as I could find out. There are some eight or ten boilers which have not been inspected this year, but it will be seen by my returns that I made every effort to get around to them all before it froze up.\n\nThe following is a description of the boilers inspected:\nLocomotive fire box, traction ........................................... 160\n\" \" \" portable .................................................. 47\nReturn tubular \" .................................................. 8\n\" \" \" traction .................................................. 45\n\" \" \" stationary .................................................. 8\nTubular stationary .................................................. 30\nRiveted tubular stationary ............................................ 7\nLocomotive fire box with return tubes, traction ..................... 8\n\" \" \" portable .................................................. 2\nUpright tubular, portable ............................................ 7\n\" \" \" stationary .................................................. 2\nWater tubular ...................................................... 2\n\nTotal ......................................................... \u2014326\n\nInspected 274 in good condition; 51 in fair condition and one in bad condition.\n\nIt is to be regretted that some firms are supplying very inferior steam gauges, the principal defect being that no hair spring is provided to hold the finger from indicating five or ten pounds more or less. Because of this the steam gauges are very difficult to set to indicate the same as the test gauge.\n\nAs in the lock pop safety valve, I think the department should do something to prevent the use of such steam gauges and protect the public against fraud in this respect, especially the threshers, for it is principally with them the unprincipled dealer tries to sell his trash.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWILLIAM WALLER,\nInspector of Steam Boilers.\n\nCALGARY, December 31st, 1904\n\nJOHN STOCKS, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina, Assa.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit my annual report for the year 1904 as Inspector of Steam Boilers in accordance with Section 19 of The Steam Boilers Ordinance.\n\nDuring the past year I held examinations at various parts in the District.\n\nApplicants for First Class Certificates .................................. 2\n\" \" Second \" \" .................................................. 20\n\" \" Third \" \" .................................................. 60 including apprentices.

The following is a description of boilers inspected:\n\nLocomotive and portable fire box type .................................. 121\nHorizontal tubular .................................................. 93\nHorizontal flue and furnace type ....................................... 19\nReturn tubular .................................................... 45\nWater tube .......................................................... 6\nUpright tubular .................................................... 42\nUpright cross sectional .............................................. 6\n\nTotal ......................................................... \u2014332\nI found these boilers in the following condition:\n\nGood .......................................................... 253\nVery fair ......................................................... 61\nFair .............................................................. 18\n\nRepairs were ordered on six boilers this year, one boiler in particular was badly damaged, and a new crown sheet and retubing had to be ordered.\n\nThere are ten boilers not in use in this district, also eight new ones almost ready to operate.\n\nThere has been a steady improvement in the boilers in my district, which without doubt is largely due to the provisions of The Steam Boilers Ordinance. Many of the larger companies are ordering larger boilers built on modern principles to carry a high pressure of steam. I would advise all owners who contemplate installing large boilers to have them slung with a yoke or truss, and in this way strengthen and improve the condition of their plant. I know of several firms who have had to replace the walls of the plant as well as some of the brackets on the boilers where the necessity for this could have been prevented had the back end of the boiler been slung as stated. If this advice were carried out very little trouble would result in the way of failure of walls.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJos.

The following statement will help to illustrate the amount of work done by this branch of the department during the year:\n\nTotal amount voted for public works ................. $611,500 00\nTotal amount expended .................................. 611,419 50\nNumber of accounts examined, certified and passed to Treasury Department for payment 5,677\nAmount collected as departmental revenue and paid to credit of general revenue .................. 12,198 37\nAmount received on account of Large Local Improvement Districts and deposited to trust accounts ........................................... 141,112 71\nNumber of accounts for work in Large Local Improvement Districts examined and passed for payment .................................................. 846\nNumber of cheques issued in payment of accounts in Large Local Improvement Districts .......... 2,300\nAmount received in payment overdue taxes in Small Local Improvement Districts and paid through trusts account to proper districts ............................................. 26,136 37\nNumber of cheques issued do .................................. 2,467\nAmount received in payment of taxes in school districts and forwarded to districts .................. 13,618 05\nNumber of cheques issued .................................... 1,600\nTotal cheques .................................................. 6,367\n\nTotal amount dealt with through books of department during year ........................................ $804,485 00\n\nAs already stated, the sum of $239,197.77 more than last year was expended during 1904, the total amount dealt with through the books of the department being $804,485.00, or an increase of $398,085.00 over the amount of work handled in 1903.\n\nBy way of explanation it might be stated that the apparent decrease from $14,148.13 to $12,128.37 in the amount of departmental revenue is rather misleading, as in 1903, $3,000.00 received from the Dominion Government on account of reimbursements for works performed by this department was included in departmental revenue. In view of this fact, the actual departmental revenue would increase during 1904 by something over $1,000.00.\n\nAdministration and Supervision.\n\nAs in the previous reports under this heading, information was given to show the cost of supervision and inspection of public works. The cost of superintendence and inspection was 1-20% in 1903, and notwithstanding the increase in work and the additional assistance it had fallen to 1-02% this year. The cost of administration and supervision was 3-30% in 1903, and this year it was 4-49%. The increase is accounted for by the cost of local improvement administration being added to cost\nof the regular staff, which was not done heretofore. Providing the local improvement staff expenditure was omitted the cost of administration and supervision would be 3.03%.\n\nThe subjoined statement will show the total amount dealt with cost of staff, percentage of cost of administration, amount expended on works requiring superintendence and inspection and percentage of cost of such inspection.\n\nTotal amount dealt with by the department during the year as shown by foregoing statement ........................................ $804,485.00\nTotal expenditure for departmental staff ........................................ 24,393.84\nPercentage of cost of administration ........................................ 3.03\nPercentage of cost of administration including local improvement staff ........................................ 4.59\nAmount expended on dams, ferries, maintenance bridges roads and other public works requiring superintendence and inspection ........................................ 338,527.17\nAmount expended for superintendence and inspection ........................................ 3,475.78\nPercentage of cost for superintendence and inspection ........................................ 1.02\n\nThe low cost of administration and supervision, and for superintendence and inspection, has been due in a great measure to efficient administration of departmental affairs and not to any decrease in salaries of the staff, which on the contrary, have been increased.\n\nSURVEYS BRANCH.\n\nStaff ..................................................................................................................

On a closer investigation, however, it was found that in some of the Land Titles offices the plans were not even given a day book number and therefore could not be said to be filed in any sense of the word, and when action by the registrars was insisted upon, it was claimed by them that The Land Titles Act and The North-West Territories Act conflicted regarding road plans and further action was refused. When the matter was further followed, it was found that the real cause of delay was lack of assistance to do the necessary work in connection with the filing of these plans, which difficulty was overcome by placing a clerk paid by this department, in the Land Titles offices at Regina and Calgary, the Land Titles office at Battleford having very little of our work to do, while at Prince Albert and Edmonton it was taken hold of with a strong hand and brought up to date, or nearly so, with their own staffs early in the year, thus placing themselves in a position to deal with road plans as they are sent to them in future. In October the Department of the Interior agreed to pay the salary of our clerk in the Regina office, but we continued to retain the one in the Calgary office to the end of the year and it is to be hoped that their services in both offices will be continued at least until all back work is closed up. The clearing up of the old work has enabled us to settle many old claims to compensation and a decided improvement is noticeable in the tone of the correspondence reaching the department from owners of lands affected by road surveys, and it is expected that during the first six months of 1905 the greater part of the outstanding claims will be settled.\n\nA word of explanation might be given regarding the amendment of The Public Works Ordinance in 1903, whereby owners dissatisfied with the Commissioner's ruling as to their claims can submit the matter to arbitration. If it is considered that the amount offered by the Commissioner is not sufficient the owner may ask for a reconsideration, and if still dissatisfied with the second offer, steps may be taken to submit the matter to arbitration. Where the claims of the owner are considered reasonable by the Commissioner payment is made in accordance therewith, otherwise an offer is made under the provisions of The Public Works Ordinance. You will notice in the statement above that 233 offers have been made, and it has been necessary to write only 35 of these a second time and of that 35 all but three have accepted the amount offered. In all ten cases\nremain unsettled while only one has taken steps to submit the matter to arbitration. So it may be assumed that these cases have been settled very satisfactorily to the settlers.\n\nAt the beginning of the season the Commissioner ruled that no more trails should be opened across country, but instead traffic be confined to the statutory road allowances, making diversions around natural obstructions where the estimated cost of improvement would not exceed the amount necessary to pay for the land for right of way should a diversion survey be made. In some cases, however, the settlers have agitated for the opening of blind lines or centre section lines, especially where the towns on the several railways are situated midway between the statutory road allowances running east and west which are two miles apart, but in each case, before such roads are opened, it has been necessary for those interested to secure agreements from the different owners whereby they agree to give the land required for the right-of-way. This method has been found to be most satisfactory in every case.\n\nArrangements were made with the Department of the Interior, at Ottawa, early in the year by which they agreed to make reservation for the land required for our surveyed trails, which affected unpatented lands, if certified tracings of the surveyor's plans are filed with them for that purpose. This method of dealing with trails through homestead property avoids the usual delay which was invariably experienced under the old system of securing assignments from the entrants for the area required for roads through unpatented lands, such assignments to be deposited with the Department of the Interior, it being almost impossible in some cases to establish communication with them, especially if the homestead had been abandoned without notification to the Dominion Land office. These arrangements, while lessening the correspondence of the office, require additional assistance to prepare the necessary copies of the plans, but the advantage derived, from being able to acquire the title to the lands at once, can be readily understood.\n\nAn effort has also being made during the past year to arrive at an understanding regarding the old trails which were surveyed by the Department at Ottawa and transferred to the Lieutenant-Governor of the Territories for public use; for while The Land Titles Act provides for the right of way for these roads whether or not they are mentioned on the title of lands affected, it is found that a great deal of dissatisfaction exists throughout the Territories where lands were purchased without the knowledge of an existing trail therethrough. It is hoped, however, that steps will be taken at an early date to remove any misunderstanding in the future regarding this matter, when lands affected by trails are purchased or homesteaded.\n\nMention might also be made of the material assistance rendered to the department by most of the companies holding lands within the Territories they, realising no doubt, the advantage to adjacent lands when road improvements are undertaken, have been most courteous regarding right-of-way required from their lands, and in many cases have made provision for the road in sale of lands before being compensated for the area taken. The co-operation in this respect on the part of the different companies controlling lands throughout the Territories does much towards relieving any dissatisfaction which might otherwise arise and which if once generated in any locality is carried on interminably.\nThe local organisations will in time no doubt prove of great assistance to the department in determining the necessity of deviation surveys in preference to injudicious attempts to improve the statutory road allowances, but at the present it is regrettable that the councils are too apt to endorse applications for surveys without being fully apprised of their nature or necessity; such action will, however, diminish as the more efficient settlers are selected as representatives in the local councils.\n\nIn addition to the surveys made by the district surveyors and engineers it was found necessary to engage local surveyors in order to have the more urgent work completed before the hard weather rendered it necessary to close operations in the field. R. C. Laurie, D.L.S., made a survey to connect the bridge across the Battle river at Battleford with the Saskatoon-Battleford trail, also completed the survey of the old Battleford-Cut Knife trail for a great part of the way. H. H. Moore, D.L.S., Calgary, surveyed the new road from Calgary to Cochrane south of the Bow river, a portion of the Calgary-Knee Hill trail and a diversion to the old Calgary-Millarville trail to permit access to the new bridge site below the Weasel Head crossing of the Elbow river on the Sarcee Indian Reserve. Samuel Brodie, D.L.S., Fort Qu'Appelle, retraced the old Troy-Prince Albert trail between South Qu'Appelle and Fort Qu'Appelle, also some surveys for right-of-way for drains near Qu'Appelle.\n\nOwing to the increased amount of work in the former district of East Assiniboia it was found necessary to divide the district into Qu'Appelle and East Assiniboia. W. T. Thompson, district surveyor and engineer of East Assiniboia retaining Qu'Appelle or the western part of his old district, while H. K. Moberly, D.L.S., formerly assistant to A. Driscoll, district surveyor and engineer for North Alberta, was engaged to take charge of East Assiniboia with headquarters at Moosomin.\n\nC. H. Ellacott having resigned his appointment as drainage engineer in April, this work was turned over to T. H. Wiggins formerly assistant chief surveyor, who also took charge of the District of Centre Assiniboia with headquarters at the department.\n\nA list of the surveys completed and examinations made in the various Public Works Districts will be found in the report of each surveyor and engineer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. J. ROBINSON,\nDirector of Surveys.\n\nPublic Works District of North Alberta.\n\nEDMONTON, ALBERTA, December 31st, 1904.\n\nJOHN STOCKS, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to report on the work performed by this office during the past season, as follows:\n\nMy first instructions arrived early in May and I started work on the 18th of the month, keeping my party in the field until the 24th of November and succeeded in completing about all the work for which instructions had been sent me, with the exception of the Victoria trail, which has again been laid over owing to pressure of other work.\nFrom a weather point of view the work of 1904 has been more satisfactory than for some years past, the wet years of 1899-1903 seem to have given place to a dry term, as sloughs that last year were full of water are now dry, and roads that of late have been almost impassable on the same account are now again in good shape for travel. In this connection I have to say that much is due the various labour districts which seemed to realise that the dry years was the proper time for the repair of roads, and the result has been three times the amount of work as during any one of the last five years.\n\nIn the matter of drains, only requests for the drainage of permanent water areas seem to have been made this year, which considerably lessened the amount of work of that description we usually have to do during a season. It is realised, however, that the present dry seasons which have apparently begun will give place again to wet, and there is an evident desire to prepare for them in the shape of drains, so that we may look for an increase in that class of work next year.\n\nTwo important pieces of work have been completed this year, first, the bridging of the Bowwick sloughs on the Battleford trail, which have been a source of much trouble for the last four years, and second, the drainage of Favels and intermediate lakes north of town. This last piece of work has been under construction for the last three years and to be appreciated must be seen. A third piece of work of this description is well under way, viz., the reclamation of the lake country between Strathcona and Ellerslie, six miles south of the former place. Ditcher No. 1 has been employed on this work during the past season and has completed over two miles of drain, the cuts of which are in places over twelve feet deep. It will probably take another season to complete this drain.\n\nA great deal of work has been done generally this year by the department in the shape of grading and providing bridges, etc., but being under the supervision of others and requiring only an occasional inspection by this office, will not be detailed in this report.\n\nIn conclusion, I have to say that I have been fortunate in my assistants during the past season. A tactful staff is of great help in dealing with the class of work coming under this office, and I think there has been very little friction caused.\n\nFollowing is a list showing the different surveys made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

1904.\n\nJohn Stocks, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina, Assa.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014I have the honour to submit the following report in connection with the work performed by me in the Lacombe Public Works District for the season 1904, a classified schedule of which is hereto attached.\n\nOwing to an unusually late spring with heavy rains, which rendered the roads impassable, I was unable to commence field operations until May 25th when I proceeded at once for the southern part of the district. From this point I intended working north and as far east and west of the\nCalgary and Edmonton branch of the Canadian Pacific railway as my work extended, which in a number of cases exceeded fifty miles, and finally completing the season's operations in the vicinity of Dried Meat lake about sixty miles east of Wetaskiwin. I found no difficulty in handling the work for which instructions were issued under the system adopted by your department, that is, by issuing instructions in order along the route laid down by the district engineer and surveyor before commencing work in the spring. This is very necessary in the Lacombe district where the work is spread over a large and comparatively narrow area, and it can be readily understood that considerable time would be lost if it was found necessary to return over the same route in order to complete the work which has been overlooked. I am pleased to report having with one or two exceptions, completed all the work for which instructions were issued, this, however, was largely owing to an unusually favourable season and the excellent condition of the roads. I found a marked improvement in the condition of the roads throughout the whole of the district. Favoured by an unusually dry season and liberal grants from your department the officials of the several districts were enabled to perform a larger amount of permanent work than was possible in the last few years.\n\nFrom what information I could gather this season the new districts formed earlier in the year seem to be accomplishing the work intended and the interest taken by the general public in the improvement of the roads is shown, in many cases by a voluntary increase of assessment over that levied under the old system and in all cases the money has been economically expended.\n\nI found that owing to the change in conditions, that is from a wet to a dry season, a number of road surveys made some years ago and also some of which have been applied for, may be abandoned, the sloughs which were to be avoided having in the meantime become sufficiently dry to admit of their being graded. This is more noticeable in the cases of the old trails east of Wetaskiwin which a number of settlers have for some time urged the department to survey and establish. These, however, have been allowed to stand pending the final location of the branch lines of the Canadian Pacific railway and also with a view of avoiding, if possible, the irreparable damage done by the survey of these roads by cutting the lands thereby into several fractions. If the moderately dry seasons continue for a few years I am of the opinion that there will no necessity for establishing these trails, as the road allowance will be opened and improved in lieu of the same without any considerable difficulty.\n\nI regret to say that the steam ditcher operating in the vicinity of Morningside encountered some very bad ground, and owing to this and the lateness in starting work (about the middle of August), the work was not what might be expected of a machine of this description. There was very little drainage work in the past season, all of which was undertaken by the districts, but, as they were constructed and the right of way arranged by mutual agreement, no report or assessment was necessary.\n\nMy party, throughout the whole season from May 25th to November 3rd, consisted of one assistant, four men and a cook. My transport, etc., included two teams and two waggons with the usual camp equipage for a party of this size.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. E.

1905.\n\nJOHN STOCKS, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina, Assa.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to submit the following report of the work done by me in the Public Works District of Calgary during the year 1904.\n\nOffice work was somewhat behind at the first of the year, owing to my illness in October and November, 1903, and I was left alone to attend to it until the middle of March, when I secured a draughtsman for some time.\n\nNew instructions for urgent work were sent me as early as the 13th of February and some more in April and May. This together with some surveys and examinations left over from the previous season, gave me more than two months work in the field, which was done, the plans and reports being sent in before I organised the party for the regular season's work.\n\nOn the 1st of August I took the field with full party going south, making surveys east and west of the Macleod trail as far as Cayley, coming round by Pekisko, Tongue Creek, Lineham, Millarville and Priddis to Calgary, where I arrived on the 10th of October.\n\nAfter two days spent at Calgary to attend to some urgent work near town, I left for the north, making surveys east and west of the Calgary and Edmonton trail as far as Olds, coming back by way of Beaver Dam\ncreek, Bradbourne, Cochrane and the Sarcee Indian Reserve. I arrived at Calgary on the 25th of November and discharged the party, keeping two men on hand to make a few examinations of proposed surveys and take levels for proposed drains.\n\nWork for the season was completed on the 22nd of December. I am now preparing, with the help of a draughtsman, plans and reports of surveys which have not already been sent in.\n\n**Schedule of surveys made during the year 1904.**\n\n**Old Trails.**\n\n- Diversion of the Morleyville trail in sections 3, 10 and 11 township 26 range 4 west of the fifth meridian.\n- Diversion of the Morleyville trail in section 13 township 26 range 6 west of the fifth meridian.\n- Diversion of the Morleyville trail in section 17 township 26 range 5 west of the fifth meridian.\n- Diversion of the Morleyville trail in sections 11 and 12 township 26 range 4 west of the fifth meridian.\n- Diversion of the Macleod trail in sections 20 and 29 township 21 range 29 west of the fourth meridian.\n- Diversion of Patrick's trail in section 33 township 21 range 2 west of the fifth meridian.\n- Diversion of trail of Sarcee Indian Reserve.\n\n**New Roads.**\n\n- Road on blind line north of sections 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 township 31 ranges 2 and 3 west of the fifth meridian.\n- Road through sections 17 and 20 township 20 range 29 west of the fourth meridian.\n- Road through sections 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 township 19 range 27 west of the fourth meridian.\n- Road to connect Pekisko with trail surveyed to High river township 18 range 1 west of the fifth meridian.\n- Road on west half of section 8 and diversion east of section 17 township 19 range 28 west of the fourth meridian.\n- Road on sections 6 and 8 township 20 range 2 west of the fifth meridian.\n- Road between the north and south forks of Sheep creek township 20 range 3 west of fifth meridian.\n- Road through sections 16, 21, 28, 33 and 34 township 21 range 3 west of the fifth meridian.\n- Road north of section 2 and part of section 1 township 22 range 1 west of the fifth meridian.\n- Re-survey of road on sections 16 and 21 township 24 range 1 west of the fifth meridian.\n- Road through sections 9, 10 and 11 township 27 range 1 west of the fifth meridian.\n- Road along blind line north of sections 18, 17, 16, 15, 14 and 13 township 30 range 2 west of the fifth meridian and north of section 18 township 30 range 1 west of the fifth meridian.\n- Road on sections 22, 27 and 32 township 32 range 2 west of the fifth meridian.\n- Road on sections 3 and 4 township 29 range 4 west of the fifth meridian.\n- Re-survey of Priddis road in section 22 township 22 range 3 west of the fifth meridian.\n- Re-survey of part of road from Cochrane steel bridge to Jumping Pound creek townships 25 and 26 range 4 west of the fifth meridian.\n\n**Diversions.**\n\n- Diversion of road surveyed last year in section 5 township 25 range 1 west of the fifth meridian.\n- Diversion of road in section 11 township 24 range 2 west of the fifth meridian.\n- Diversion of road across the fifth meridian north of township 24.\n- Diversion east of section 27 township 25 range 4 west of the fifth meridian.\nDiversion north of section 9 township 19 range 29 west of the fourth meridian.\n\nDiversion north of section 11 township 17 range 29 west of the fourth meridian.\n\nDiversion east section 13 township 17 range 27 west of the fourth meridian.\n\nDiversion south section 2 township 19 range 28 west of the fourth meridian.\n\nDiversion north of section 23 township 17 range 29 west of the fourth meridian.\n\nDiversion east section 14 township 19 range 1 west of the fifth meridian.\n\nDiversion east section 16 township 19 range 1 west of the fifth meridian.\n\nDiversion north section 11 township 19 range 1 west of the fifth meridian.\n\nDiversion east of sections 20 and 30 township 16 range 28 west of the fourth meridian.\n\nDiversion north section 25 township 29 range 29 west of the fourth meridian.\n\nDiversion east section 12 township 31 range 2 west of the fifth meridian.\n\nDiversion east section 4 township 32 range 2 west of the fifth meridian.\n\nDiversion north section 28 township 32 range 1 west of the fifth meridian.\n\nDiversion south section 5 township 27 range 4 west of the fifth meridian.\n\nDiversion east section 21 township 26 range 5 west of the fifth meridian.\n\nDiversion east section 5 township 24 range 4 west of the fifth meridian.\n\nCompletion of diversions sections 6 and 7 township 19 range 28 west of the fourth meridian.\n\n**Drains.**\n\nTo drain slough in section 34 township 23 range 29 west of the fourth meridian;

the number of surveys and examinations was large, as the instructions for the different surveys required in each part of the district could not, in many instances, be issued, at the same dates it necessitated my going twice over part of the district.\n\nTravelling was made much easier this year; the roads were in general in fairly good condition after the first of July owing to the dryness of the season, and also on account of the large amount of improvement work done by your department on the main roads throughout the district.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAlbert Chas.

These being completed I organised my party and commenced field work on the 20th of May.\n\nI began work in the western part of my district working gradually eastwards during the first part of the season and then westward again, finishing the season in the vicinity of Medicine Hat.\n\nAs in 1903 the greater part of the season's work consisted in the survey of old trails of considerable length or of roads to take the place of the old trails where changes therein seemed advisable. In addition to this a number of road allowances were examined and also old surveyed trails and the necessity for surveys reported on; bridge sites were located and diversions made to road allowances and surveyed trails.\n\nA detailed report was sent in to your department on the completion of each piece of work.\n\nThe weather was exceptionally good during the greater part of the season and very little time was lost, a few days in June owing to rain and a few days in September through snow.\n\nField work was completed on November 30th, no surveys being left outstanding.\n\nDuring the month of December I have been occupied preparing returns of the season's work, and one survey for which instructions were received after my party was disbanded, was examined and reported on.\n\nI give below a list of surveys made and other work done.\nLIST OF SURVEYS.\n\nDiversion from surveyed trail from Medicine Hat to Dunmore in section 28 township 12 range 5 west of the fourth meridian.\n\nDiversion

Co. at Hanley.\n\nQu'Appelle Public Works District.\n\nSOUTH QU'APPELLE, December 31st, 1904.\n\nJOHN STOCKS, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina, Assa.\n\nSir,\u2014I beg to submit the following report on surveys and inspections made in Qu'Appelle Public Works District during the past season.\n\nThe heavy snowfall of last winter resulted in unusually high water when spring opened, the Qu'Appelle lakes and river reaching a higher level than at any previous time within the recollection of the oldest settler. In consequence of this many bridges were seriously damaged.\n\nHigh water prevailed generally throughout the district and a large number of diversion surveys, to avoid ponds and sloughs on the road allowances were rendered necessary in order to provide roads which would be available at all seasons; before making these surveys examinations were generally made to ascertain the feasibility of drainage but in many cases it was found that the cost of such work would be altogether out of proportion to the cost of the land required for right of way to avoid these obstructions and where usually a high and dry roadway could be constructed at small expense. The appended schedules give the location of the various surveys and other particulars relating to them.\n\nDRAINAGE.\n\nThe schedule under this heading gives locations of the drains laid cut for construction with other particulars also a list of examinations made to determine the feasibility of drainage in certain cases.\n\nThe most important drain staked out and constructed during the past season is one connecting Leech lake with the Little White Sand river in township 24 range 4 west of the second meridian.\n\nThe total length of excavation one mile, bottom width six feet and side slope 1\u00bd to 1. The excavation was completed to Leech lake in November last when the water commenced flowing out. The lake being very shallow it is necessary to extend the excavation into its bed for some distance in order to obtain a depth of 2\u00bd feet of water, which is the estimated reduction in level that will be effected by the construction of this drain.\n\nThe work of excavating in the lake bed was found rather difficult but by the use of rubber boots the men were able to extend the excavation until a depth of 18 inches of water was reached and after the ice had set it was intended to complete the work.\n\nLeech lake is connected with Crescent lake to the south and Rousays lake to the north, the latter being also connected with Pebble lake by means of a drain laid out by me in 1899.\n\nThe water in all these lakes appears to stand at the same level at the present time, there being no perceptible current in the connecting channels so that in the course of a year or two the drain which is now in operation should effect a general lowering of the water level about 2\u00bd feet and thereby reclaim a vast area of fine hay meadow which for several years has been flooded.\nIt may be mentioned that a few years ago all these lakes were nearly dry and to bring water into them a drain was laid out and constructed under the supervision of Mr. Child, C.E., in 1898, to divert water from Insinger creek to Rousay's lake from that source, but owing to the unusually wet seasons of recent years more water had been brought down than is required and with your permission I have had this water shut off for the present by the construction of a small earth dam, so that all the water from Insinger creek will now follow its old channel.\n\n**Schedule of New Roads Surveyed.**\n\nAlong division line between east and west halves of sections 2 and 11 township 19a range 10 west of the second

T. Thompson,\nDistrict Engineer and Surveyor.\n\n---\n\nPublic Works District of East Assiniboia.\n\nMOOSOMIN, December 1st, 1904.\n\nJOHN STOCKS, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina, N.W.T.\n\nSir,\u2014I beg to submit the following report of work completed in the Public Works District of East Assiniboia during the season of 1904.\n\nMy appointment to the surveys branch was made the 1st of April of this year, and during that month I was in the department at Regina. Owing to the late spring and poor roads it was the middle of June before my party took the field, but from that time until the middle of November only a few days were lost on account of rain. My time has been taken up with diversions around sloughs, crossings of valleys, draining examinations and assisting the councillors wherever help was needed.\n\nAll surveys that were important with the exception of three have been completed and reported, though there are quite a number still on hand. The surveys required for this district were very much behind as my list included some from 1902 and 1903 besides the current work for 1904. I have not had time this season to go thoroughly into the bridges as my time was taken up more particularly with surveys, though next season I shall devote more time to that part of my work.\n\nNew

K. Moberly,\nDistrict Engineer and Surveyor.\n\nSaskatchewan Public Works District.\n\nPrince Albert, December 31st, 1904.\n\nJohn Stocks, Esq.,\nDistrict Commissioner of Public Works,\nRegina, N.W.T.\n\nSir,\u2014During the season I have performed all the surveys and investigations ordered except two, one of which came too late, and the other I had to report on before performing the survey. In addition to these I have made such other surveys and investigations as I found were required while on the ground, and going from one locality to another. On the whole the season has been very favourable, not much rain and less winds than usual,\nThe survey of part of the trail from Prince Albert towards Montreal lake, some 30 miles, was my largest work. Next in extent was retracing 10 miles of the trail from Saskatoon towards Battleford. New roads leading into Melfort required over seven miles of survey. These were urgently required, as the road allowances were singularly unsuitable. Most of the right of way will be given free of cost. The public for some years have been using these routes in anticipation of the survey. The survey to connect leading roads with Isbister's ferry, about six miles, assures an uninterrupted route from Prince Albert easterly to Coxby-Fort a La Corne, etc. About four miles of survey of roads at the town of Tisdale section 30 township 41 range 14 west of the second meridian, is for substitutes for road allowances, which were scarcely practicable. The right of way for nearly all of which will be given free. All of the foregoing are in the schedule annexed.\n\nNo engineering difficulties were encountered but the ever increasing difficulty of finding monuments of the original surveys and the growth of timber and scrub makes the survey work more arduous and slower every year. Indeed there is but little of the true prairie left.\n\nSeveral ditches were laid out. Plans, profiles, estimates, etc., were made and some reports sent in while on the route. On every hand I find more drainage being done than formerly. It is being recognised by the people that it is a vital part of road making.\n\nWith the increased number of settlers, the statute labour of each year is doing much to improve the roads, more especially the worst places. The department has taken means to promptly repair small bad breaks where such are on leading roads. This is giving great satisfaction.\n\nFerries.\n\nThe unexpected and unprecedented sudden breaking up of the rivers with much higher water did some damage, as might be expected, to some of the ferries, notably the Ibister ferry and Adams ferry. These were reported on and so promptly repaired that there was scarcely any interruption of the public travel.\n\nI am now working at the plans and field notes of my season's work. These will be completed in good time as per regulations. Reports will also be sent in during the winter on drains with profiles, estimates, etc.\n\nWhen the Canadian Northern is completed to Battleford (it is about completed now to the North Saskatchewan river), new roads or improvements on road allowances to reach the new stations may be required. The same results will follow the completion of said railway from Melfort to Prince Albert (75 miles). The general effect of such railways cannot at present be fully anticipated.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nCyrus Carroll, D.L.S.,\nDistrict Engineer and Surveyor.\n\nSchedule of Surveys performed in District of Saskatchewan, 1904.\n\nRoad Diversions.\n\nOn the east side of section 30 township 47 range 26 west of the second meridian, to avoid a slough and two crossings of McFarlane's creek.\n\nOn east side of section 21 township 47 range 27 west of the second meridian, to avoid a slough.\nOn N.E. \u00a7 section 19 and N.W. \u00a7 section 20 township 42 range 5 west of the third meridian, to avoid a lake.\n\nEast of section 35 township 43 range 5 west of the third meridian and section 2 township 44 range 5 west of the third meridian, to avoid a slough.\n\nOn east side of sections 3 and 10 township 47 range 26 west of the second meridian, to avoid a slough.\n\nOn north side of section 22 township 42 range 3 west of the third meridian, to avoid sloughs.\n\nOn east side of section 19 township 36 range 6 west of the third meridian, to avoid a slough.\n\nOn east side of river lot No. 25, Prince Albert settlement, to avoid a slough.\n\nNew Roads.\n\nOn north side section 16 township 46 range 23 west of the second meridian, to connect trail with road allowances.\n\nThrough sections 16, 15, 14, 13 and 12 township 48 range 24 west of the second meridian and section 25 township 48 range 24a west of the second meridian, to connect roads and Ishister's ferry.\n\nExtension of road on east side of the Q.

As stated in our 1903 report a series of standard bridge plans were prepared and they are still being maintained except in cases of larger structures requiring special designs. The increase in the work of this branch during the year will be clearly illustrated by the list of roads, bridges, fireguards, etc.\n\nConstruction of Bridges.\n\nOf the 364 bridges dealt with during the season, 247 were new structures, as compared with 127 in 1903. These bridges were constructed according to designs prepared to meet the difficulties existing in different portions of the Territories. Concrete substructures where used have proved very satisfactory, and will undoubtedly as far as possible in future be substituted for timber. The expenditure in connection with the handling of bridges was $330,615.73 compared with $191,917.10, last year. An explanation regarding the increase is, that in addition to other bridges, this amount includes the expenditure incurred during the year on the Belly and Old Man river bridges, a sum of which amounting to $84,235.92, has been reimbursed by the Dominion Government. The usual schedule of bridges constructed, reconstructed and repaired, together with a list of steel bridges is shown below.\n\nSCHEDULE OF Bridges constructed, rebuilt and repaired.\n\nArm river, section 13 township 24 range 28w2.

The following bridges are worthy of special mention.\nBridge over Blindman river, Sections 19/30-42-25.\n\nThis is a new structure consisting of a 60 foot steel span, and 60 foot timber approach, and serves as an outlet to Morningside and Lacombe for the settlers in the Medicine Lodge settlement west of Gull lake. This together with the bridge constructed last season over the outlet of Gull lake seems to satisfactorily meet the requirements.\n\nBridge over Battle river Sections 31/1 Townships 44/55-33-4.\n\nThis structure consists of an 80 ft. steel span and 40 ft. of pile approach which makes a good substantial crossing, and enables the settlers east of the river to reach their market town, Wetaskiwin.\n\nThree Bridges over Crow's Nest river between Frank and Blairmore.\n\nThe residents of Frank and Blairmore have for some years been making requests for the bridging of the Crow's Nest river at this point. Careful inspection was made, and the whole situation fully reported upon. To meet the requirements it was found that three bridges would be required; two on the n.w. \u00bc of section 36, and one on the s.w. \u00bc of 36, all in township 7-4-5, each structure to consist of an 80 ft. span with necessary pile approach.\n\nBridge over Drywood river, Sections 17/18-4-28-4.\n\nThe construction of this bridge has been held in abeyance. About two years ago it was decided to construct a 50 ft. wooden truss with sufficient pile approach, but the floods of 1902 so changed the condition that the construction was postponed until this season, when a 100 ft. steel span with necessary approaches was erected. This makes a very substantial structure, and with the other bridge constructed on this stream in range 29 and bridge over Yarrow creek serve as important outlets to the Crow's Nest Railway for the settlers living in the foot-hill country south of these streams over what is known as the trail from Pincher to the oil fields.\n\nBridge over Elbow river at Sprucecave.\n\nFor some years past the old bridge at this point has not been giving satisfaction, and each season we have had more or less trouble and expense in repairing it. Owing to the very unsatisfactory condition of the river channel at this point a very careful examination was made with a view to constructing a bridge that would meet the requirements. In order to do this it was found necessary to construct two 80 ft. steel spans with 60 ft. of approach over the main new channel, and a 60 ft. timber truss with 100 ft. of approach over an old overflow channel, and a 40 ft. pile bridge on the overflow channel between the channels mentioned above. The construction was completed early in 1904. This makes a very substantial structure and ought to meet the flood conditions at that point, which are by no means an easy matter to overcome.\nBridge over Little Bow river, Section 5-15-21-4.\n\nThis bridge consists of an 80 ft. steel span with a 20 ft. approach to one end and affords a good crossing for the settlers residing between the Bow and Little Bow rivers. After crossing this bridge settlers have a clear way to the Calgary and Edmonton Railway, and by means of the new bridges constructed over the Old Man and Belly rivers settlers are enabled to reach Macleod or Lethbridge if necessary.\n\nBridge over Qu'Appelle river at Katepwe, Sections 22/27-19-12-2.\n\nThe old Katepwe bridge located at the mouth of the Katepwe lakes, has not, owing to its unsatisfactory location, been giving satisfaction for some few years, and last spring it was almost completely destroyed by floods. After a careful examination by our inspector, it was decided to change the location to road allowance something over a mile down the river, at a point known as Peltier's Crossing. An entire new bridge consisting of an 80 ft. steel span and necessary approaches was constructed, which seems to satisfactorily meet the requirements.\n\nBridge over Qu'Appelle river at Tantallon, Section 9-18-32-1.\n\nOwing to the rapid growth of this town and the great number of settlers in the vicinity adjacent to the town, the department has on several occasions been requested to construct a bridge over the river at this point. A bridge consisting of an 80 ft. steel span and the necessary approaches was constructed; this makes a total of 19 steel bridges on this stream. In former years bridges of almost any design were constructed on this stream, but the floods of 1902 and last spring have illustrated very clearly that something of a more permanent nature must be provided.\n\nBridge over Souris river near Coalfields, Sections 33/34-1-6-2.\n\nThe old bridge at this point has been in bad shape for some years and although repaired last year, the floods of the past spring destroyed it completely. This year a structure consisting of an 80 ft. steel span and necessary approaches was constructed and makes a very serviceable crossing.\n\nBridge over Souris river near Oxbow, Sections 22/32-3-2-3.\n\nOwing to the unusual floods which prevailed in this part of the country last spring, the old timber truss bridge was completely washed away and it was found necessary to construct an entire new bridge. The bridge which was open for traffic early in the fall, consists of a 125 ft. steel span with 100 ft. of approach on one end and 20 ft. on the other, which makes a good substantial crossing and meets the requirements of the settlers south of the river.\n\nBridge over Qu'Appelle river at Fort Qu'Appelle.\n\nThis bridge which has heretofore been known as the Hudson Bay bridge was constructed several years ago by that company. For the last\nfew years the department has been called upon to maintain it and the expense in connection with this work each season was considerable and at the same time the bridge was not giving entire satisfaction. This year, the old structure was taken down and a substantial bridge was constructed, consisting of an 89 ft. steel span with necessary approaches. As this bridge serves the general public, the east bridge was dispensed with, not being in a safe condition for traffic. The bridge over same stream at Lebret some miles east of the fort was also repaired.\n\nCONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF ROADS.\n\nOn account of the increase and extension of settlement and consequent fencing up of the old unsurveyed trails, thus forcing the use of road allowances, at least until really necessary deviation surveys are made, a large amount of road improvement is necessitated each season and the amount of road making and improvements from this cause alone is a large item each year. In addition to this the nature of the soil (generally clay loam) in the most fertile sections of the country over which the heaviest haulage of grain has usually to pass makes the maintenance of such roads in wet seasons an exceedingly difficult undertaking and in many places entirely beyond the means of the Department or local organisations. More attention to drainage of road bed to prevent damage and destruction by water would, in many cases, help the unfavourable conditions that have to be contended with, but the fact must be borne in mind that clay and earth roads always go to pieces under heavy traffic during wet weather and the scarcity of rock and gravel to use as a top dressing in many localities will be a serious drawback to even passable roads for many years to come. During 1904, $95,064.00 was expended on road improvements directly by the Department, in addition to that done by the Local Improvement Districts, a good many of the most thickly settled districts have organised and placed themselves in a position to spend the Local Improvement Taxes upon the roads under the direction of the council. The recent wet years have been an object lesson and demonstrated pretty clearly that in many localities dry seasons are when improvements should be done, it being too expensive to grade up roads through sloughs and on wet ground during the wet seasons, while if the road had been raised and ditched during the dry seasons, it would have been possible to use it.\n\nThe importance of using brush and small timber to corduroy roads in wet places has been in many parts of the country entirely lost sight of, and many roads constructed without corduroy bottom simply lost, while the material available for such work is generally plentiful in the localities were required.\n\nSCHEDULE of Road Improvements undertaken during the year 1904.\n\nBetween sections 33/34, 15/16,

New ferries were built at Clark's Crossing, Wingard and Osler. Owing to the large influx of population to the district west of Hanley, a new ferry was installed on the South Saskatchewan river about twenty-six miles west of that point. The new bridge over Old Man river at Macleod having been completed early in the season the ferry there was moved up the river to a point near Pincher creek and was a source of relief to the settlers on the north side of the river. It will be noted from the list that twenty-three ferries were operated during the season.\n\nFIREGUARDS.\n\nDuring 1903, 1884.54 miles of fireguard were ploughed along the Canadian Pacific Railway and branches, the Alberta Railway and Coal Company and the St Mary's River Railway. This in addition to 1119 miles of other fireguard constructed or maintained made a total of 3003.54 miles. Contracts with the railway companies were cancelled the latter part of 1903, and railway fireguarding consequently discontinued. In addition to reploughing the existing country fireguards, several miles of new guard were ploughed, the total mileage for the season of 1904 amounting to 1460.01. The ploughing of these guards was generally up to the standard specifications, viz: 16 feet in width, though in some localities two 8 foot guards were provided and grass\nburned between them, this, where the nature of the country will permit, being undoubtedly a more effective guard than the one 16 foot guard, though the difficulty in getting grass burned between guards has always been a drawback. The following schedule will show the location and mileage of guards constructed and maintained during 1904:\n\n| Fireguards, 1904 | Miles |\n|------------------|-------|\n| South of Swift Current in tps. 14/15-13/14w3 | 15    |\n| Gull Lake fireguard | 16.50 |\n| From Rush Lake tp. 17-10w3, to Saskatchewan river tp. 19-12w3 | 19    |\n| From Creek sec. 1-13-19w3, to Swift Current Creek sec. +12-18w3 | 7     |\n| From Swift Current creek sec. 30-10-20w3, to sec. 6-12-22w3 | 10    |\n| From Swift Current creek tp. 18-12w3, to tp. 18-11w3 | 35    |\n| From C.P.R. south to line between res. 15/16w3, to Swift Current creek | 23    |\n| Crane lake fireguard | 41    |\n| Swift Current creek to Pettiers' lake | 12    |\n| From Crane lake in sec. 22-13-24w3, to lake in sec. 22-13-26w3 | 33    |\n| From Swift Current creek 21-19-13w3, to re. 15w3 | 18    |\n| From Bittern lake tp. 13-28w3, south to Maple Creek coulee trail, secs. 10/11-9-28w3 | 28.75 |\n| From C.P.R. between tps. 13/14-14w3, to fireguard between Swift Current and Pettiers' lake | 34    |\n| From tps. 18/19-11w3, north easterly to sec. 2-21-7w3 | 22    |\n| From Purple Springs, on line between res. 14/15, to west boundary of tp. 5 | 33.9 |\n| On north boundary of tp. 14 from Bow river to Little Bow | 60    |\n| From Old Man river to Belly river tp. 9-23w4 | 7.50  |\n| From C.N.P.R. to Belly river tp. 9-18w4 | 8     |\n| From C.N.P.R. to Belly river, res. 20/21w4 | 3.50  |\n| From C.N.P.R. to A.K.R. & Co. on line between res. 18/19w4 | 21    |\n| From C.N.P.R. to Belly river along west boundary of range 14 | 7     |\n| From Old Man river to Little Bow, between res. 24/25w4 | 69.30 |\n| On north boundary township 5, following line between res. 14/15w4 to Milk river | 24    |\n| From C.N.P.R. to Belly river on the east boundary of Piegan Indian Reserve, tp. 8-26w4 to tp. 6-26w4, south to Belly river | 25    |\n| On north boundary of tp. 12, across res. 25/26/27w4 | 14    |\n| On north boundary of tp. 9, from re. 28w3 to re. 6w4 | 48    |\n| From Irvin tp. 11-2w4 south to tp. 10-2w4 | 12    |\n| From Bowell station N.E., to Saskatchewan river at north boundary tp. 14-5w4 | 18    |\n| From Bowell station to South Saskatchewan river between res. 7/8w4 | 11    |\n| From Saskatchewan river tp. 12 9w4, to coulee 10-8w4 | 24    |\n| On west boundary of re. 2v5, from Sheep creek to High river | 14.50 |\n| From C. & E. to Little Bow river on north boundary of tp. 14, across res. 26/27/28w4 | 3.30  |\n| On north boundary tp. 16, across res. 28/27/26/25w4 | 22    |\n| On line between res. 24/25 from north tp. line of 14, to fireguard on north line of tp. 20-w4 | 42    |\n| On north-east and south of township 20-27w4 | 18    |\n| From Gleichen north on the line between ranges 22/23w4 to north boundary of township 24 | 17    |\n| On north boundary of township 26, across ranges 25/26/27/28w4 | 24    |\n| From C.P.R. to Crow Foot guard township 24-27/28w4 | 9     |\n| On line between ranges 3/4 in township 13w2 | 12.50 |\n| From section 30-20-26w2 to section 8-21-27w2 | 8     |\n| On four sides township 29-15w2 | 24    |\n| From Shepard north on line between ranges 28/29 to north of township 26 and west of C. & E. railway | 30    |\n| From north township 26 on line between ranges 28/29w4 to Rose Bud river | 60    |\n| From C. & E. to east boundary of range 20w4 near Dead Horse lake following north boundary of township 24 | 60    |\n| From South Saskatchewan river to Many Island lake townships 13/14-2/3w4 | 21    |\n| From east of range 25w4 to one mile west of C. & E. following boundary of township 10-25/26/27w4 | 13    |\n| From section 9-26-2w5 to Beaver dam creek | 15.50 |\n| On north boundary of township 23-28w4 | 60    |\nFrom north boundary of township 24, following ranges 25/26 to Knee Hill creek in township 30 ................................................................. 31\nOn township 22-26/27/28w4 ................................................................. 19\nFrom C.P.R. south to Bow river following line between ranges 12/13w4 ................................................................. 22-25\nFrom Swift Current creek, n.e. corner section 21-19-13w3, west of fireguard on boundary of township 19-15w3 ................................................................. 15\nFrom Four Mile coulee to Battle creek and from Battle creek, in section 31-7-29w3, west to 4th meridian, to section 19-4-28w3 ................................................................. 6\nFrom line between ranges 2/3w3, following line between townships 27/28, west, sections 33/27w4 ................................................................. 30\nFrom C.P.

Payn LeSueur, Cochrane, Alta.\n\nEvidence of the popularity of small district organisation is shown by the large number of petitions which have been received, these petitions being, as a rule, the preparatory steps to such organisation.\n\nAt the beginning of the year the large districts were reorganised, their boundaries being made to correspond with those of the electoral districts. On account of the increased assessable area and the heavy immigration of the last few years, it was nearing the close of 1904 before all the large districts were assessed.\n\nFrom large local improvement districts in 1904, local improvement taxes to the amount of $132,643.96 were collected and the number of receipts issued 16,646.\n\nThe sum of $25,927.69 for arrears of taxes in small districts was collected by this branch and forwarded to secretary-treasurers.\n\nArrears of taxes in school districts amounting to $13,987.53 were collected and sent to school treasurers.\n\nThese amounts were paid by cheque, the number issued to small local improvement district secretary-treasurers being 2,467 and to school treasurers 1,600.\n\nThe work of correspondence in connection with these arrears, (both school and local improvement) has grown to such an extent that it comprises a large part of the duties of the branch. The failure of some secretary-treasurers to promptly forward returns from school and small local improvement districts and to notify this branch of all payments of arrears made, has entailed considerable work that otherwise would not have been necessary.\n\nAn idea of the general correspondence of the branch may be gathered from the fact that in 1904 the amount of mail matter received was 46,232 items. The amounts sent out was 124,924 items, which was composed of 21,418 letters, 22,180 receipts, 79,478 notices and circulars and 3,048 cheques.\n\nThe assessment of large districts for 1904 was as follows:\n### Department of Public Works\n\n| No. | District          | Amount of Assessment | Amount Collected | Amount Expended |\n|-----|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| 550 | Banff             | 4,245 89             | 1,434 45         | 1,279 46        |\n| 551 | Battleford        | 19,015 69            | 5,511 52         | 1,099 83        |\n| 552 | Batoche           | 4,671 75             | 2,043 33         | 1,240 33        |\n| 553 | Cardston          | 14,191 92            | 10,168 79        | 8,479 18        |\n| 554 | Cannington        | 4,712 10             | 3,510 67         | 972 45          |\n| 555 | Calgary East      | 7,437 73             | 1,817 26         | 789 90          |\n| 556 | Calgary West      | 7,472 24             | 2,311 37         | 1,805 88        |\n| 557 | Edmonton          | 760 82               | 190 26           | 583 61          |\n| 558 | Grenfell          | 2,090 90             | 1,456 71         | 1,133 95        |\n| 559 | High River        | 6,431 32             | 996 47           | 6,311 75        |\n| 560 | Innisfail         | 3,721 74             | 1,269 37         | 418 21          |\n| 561 | Kinistino         | 5,197 76             | 2,586 66         | 1,516 03        |\n| 562 | Lacombe           | 8,981 52             | 3,062 22         | 957 50          |\n| 563 | Lethbridge        | 21,416 97            | 6,237 69         | 4,905 59        |\n| 564 | Macleod           | 15,193 15            | 2,183 77         | 478 13          |\n| 565 | Maple Creek       | 19,230 09            | 15,668 42        | 7,136 55        |\n| 566 | Medicine Hat      | 12,992 40            | 4,571 14         | 3,822 56        |\n| 567 | Mitchell          | 2,260 34             | 377 64           | 573 65          |\n| 568 | Moosomin          | All small dist's.    | 48 00            | 400 62          |\n| 569 | Moose Jaw         | 26,089 94            | 11,810 93        | 4,774 37        |\n| 570 | Prince Albert     | 717 53               | 336 23           | 518 18          |\n| 571 | Qu'Appelle, South | 8,653 57             | 8,387 40         | 2,625 22        |\n| 572 | Qu'Appelle, North | 9,118 94             | 5,120 86         | 1,853 37        |\n| 573 | Regina, North     | 7,655 80             | 2,896 24         | 719 82          |\n| 574 | Regina, South     | 3,390 23             | 5,344 61         | 2,814 05        |\n| 575 | Saltcoats         | 6,552 38             | 3,552 41         | 715 05          |\n| 576 | Saskatoon         | 11,800 43            | 7,375 17         | 2,970 32        |\n| 577 | Souris            | 7,300 46             | 10,830 92        | 950 33          |\n| 578 | Strathcona        | 5,384 93             | 2,434 69         | 1,015 79        |\n| 579 | St. Albert        | 2,133 67             | 317 89           | 665 75          |\n| 580 | Victoria          | 2,702 23             | 627 13           | 2,230 30        |\n| 581 | Wetaskiwin        | 7,439 49             | 2,858 87         | 1,241 68        |\n| 582 | Whitewood         | All small dist's.    | 485 59           | 407 63          |\n| 583 | Wolseley          | 530 88               | 282 09           | 1,377 01        |\n| 584 | Yorkton           | 8,235 60             | 5,441 76         | 1,030 56        |\n\n**Totals**: 269,647 85  \n**Amount Collected**: 132,643 96  \n**Amount Expended**: 70,030 07\n\n### Villages\n\nIndicative of the growth in population, as well as the common desire for self government, is the number of villages which have been formed and also the towns which have been established.

The following schedule will show where the machines have been operated and the work accomplished by each.\n\nSTEAM Ditching Machines.\n\nNo. 1\u2014Completed 10,900 ft. on Drain No. 110 between Strathcona and Ellerslie.\nNo. 2\u2014Completed 14,850 ft. on Drain No. 4 known as Favel lake drain.\nNo. 3\u2014Completed 8,175 ft. on Drain No. 30 east of Lacombe to drain into Wolf creek.\nNo. 4\u2014Completed 11,221 ft. on Drain No. 96 east of Yellow Grass.\nNo. 5\u2014At Prince Albert (not in operation).\n\nIRRIGATION OFFICE.\n\nStaff\n\n1 assistant engineer.\n1 draughtsman.\n1 clerk of records and correspondence clerk.\n1 stenographer (temporary).\n\nThe work of the Irrigation Office is embodied in the following schedule:\n\nNumber of letters received ........................................... 2,310\nNumber of letters sent out ............................................ 3,221\nNumber of forms and circulars prepared and mailed .............. 2,000\nNumber of applications for water rights, with necessary memorials, plans and notices, examined and recorded (in duplicate) .................................................. 85\nNumber of licences received and recorded (in triplicate) .......... 13\nNumber of transfers and agreements for use of water received and recorded (in triplicate) ............................................. 179\nNumber of notices of occupation for right of way for irrigation works over Crown lands received and recorded ........ 15\nNumber of returns, etc., received and recorded and placed on file respecting hydrographic records ......................... 610\n\nDuring the past year many enquiries regarding irrigation in the Territories have been received, especially from settlers from the United States who have farmed lands under irrigation, and in consequence a large number of applications for water rights were filed and dealt with.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Company have proceeded with the construction of their scheme to divert water from the Bow river near Calgary. Substantial headworks have been constructed, and several contracts for excavation of the main irrigation canal completed.\n\nThe Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company (successors of the Canadian North West Irrigation Company) have also made extensive additions and improvements to their scheme for the diversion of water from St. Mary river, to provide for the reclamation of a large tract of land in the south-eastern portion of Alberta.\n\nSettlement in the Territories during the past year has vastly increased, and is particularly noticeable in what is known as the semi-arid region, so sparsely settled heretofore, and the work of the Irrigation Office has increased proportionately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJOHN STOCKS.\n| Topic
